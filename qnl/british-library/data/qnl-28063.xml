CORRESPONDENCE RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OP A FRIENDLY UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN ENGLAND AND RUSSIA AS TO THE GENERAL POLICY OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS IN CENTRAL ASIA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO AFGHANISTAN. {Continuation of Chapter I of Mr. Henvefs precis.'] 1. Conversation between Lord Derby and Count Schouvaloff regarding tbe position of the British and Rus sian Governments in respect to the Central Asian question in March 1875. —The Russian Ambassador, Count Schouvaloff, called upon Lord Derby on the 12th March, being on the point of leaving England for a month, and expressed his wish to ascertain more clearly than he had as yet done the views of Her Majesty’s Government on the Central Asian question. He then proceeded to explain at some length what he described as his personal views on the subject of the extension of Russian power in Central Asia, for he professed to have no instructions from his own Government. He expressed himself as unfavorable to fresh annexations, and regretted some of those which have already taken place. He then asked whether he was right in supposing that there was no inclination on the part of England to advance further in the direction of the Russian possessions, unless such advance were con sidered necessary for defensive purposes, in order to protect our actual domi nions. Lord Derby replied that his view was undoubtedly correct, and that, so far from desiring to annex any part of Afghanistan, we (the British Government) deprecate such result as bringing only increased cost and trouble without advan tage. We wished to be on good terms with the Afghan Ruler, and to x exercise a friendly influence over his policy, but his independence was not likely to be menaced by us. The only case in which Lord Derby could conceive an advance of British troops westward as probable, was in the event of any Russian move ment tending to the occupation of Merv. He reminded Count Schouvaloff of the. warning given some months back of the great importance which the Indian Government attached to Merv, and of the danger to our relations that would ensue if it were meddled with. Count Schouvaloff said he had com municated this warning to his Government, and admitted the danger that might arise if the two Powers were brought face to face in the neighbourhood of Herat. He then asked, “was he justified in assuming that our action in this matter would depend on that of Russia, that England would not move if Russia did not?” Lord Derby replied that the British Government only desired to maintain the status quo, and certainly would not be the first to take aggressive steps. Count Schouvaloff then enquired whether the Persian Government had any reason for supposing that English influence was being used to prevent the relations of Persia with the Chiefs of Biloochistan being friendly. Lord Derby expressed his conviction that the Persian Government had no reason for believ ing anything of the kind. Count Schouvaloff then requested to be enabled to contradict reports about the close alliance into which, it was said, the British Government was entering with the Ameer of Kashgar. It was reported that arms had been supplied to him from India in large quantities, military instructors provided, and that the object was to use the Ameer as an ally, who might be serviceable in any future quarrel with Russia. Lord Derby contradicted the story of the arms and the instructors, and explained that the sole objects of the British Govern ment in that region were, first, the exploration of a country which had for A( 2 ) many generations been unknown to Europeans, and next, the opening of trade with countries which had hitherto been kept close by the zealous exclusiveness of the Chinese authorities. \Despatch from Earl of Derly to Lord A. Loftus, Secret, May 137o, Nos. 74-80.] 2. Conversation between the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg and Count Schouvaloff— lu the same month on arriving at St. Petersburg, Count Schouvaloff proceeded to discuss the same question with Lord N. Loftus. The rumour of a Eritish advonce to Quettah had dis quieted the .Russian Grovernment. It was held to foreshadow the occupation of Herat, a move which would impede the designs ol Russia on Northern Persia and the line of the Attrek. In Lord A. Loftus’ opinion no confidence could be placed in the assurance of pacific and friendly intentions on the part of the Imperial Government, and he advised the English Cabinet to hold itself aloof from all specific engagements, and to reserve to itself full liberty to act in any way in w T hich circumstances might render advisable. The following is the purport of the conversation : Count Schouvaloff began by referring to his interview with Lord Derby, and expressed his satisfaction at the conciliatory and pacific language used. He had in reply given the most positive assurances that the Imperial Govern ment had no intention to make further advances or conquests in Central Asia, and that their sole object was to provide for and ensure the safety of com mercial traffic and the maintenance of order. Lord Derby’s remarks had also been most favorably received by the Emperor and Prince Gortschakoff, and Count Schouvaloff hopes that on hi s return he would be charged with a communication which would establish perfect under standing and confidence between the two Governments in regard to the Central Asian question. Referring to what Lord Derby had said in regard to the maintenance of the status quo, he appeared to understand Lord Derby’s remarks in the sense that England would make no advance for the occupation of Quettah or else where which would oblige Russia to advance likewise. But Lord A. Loftus pointed that first it was essential to ascertain what constituted the Russian status quo. Russia had been advancing in Central Asia e'ver since she crossed the Syr-Daria. The British Government had been stationary and had never gone beyond its own frontiers. Count Schouvaloff’s arguments appeared to assume that the British Gov ernment was the aggressive power, which should be bound to a policy of inac- taon whilst no fixed hmitatioa was imposed upou the operations of Russia. Por instance. General Lomakin only a few months ago was engaged in an expedition along the Attrek. Now Lord A. Loftus was under the impression that the Persian Government had only recognized the mouth of the Attrek and a shoit distance extending into the interior from the mouth of that river, and If renlr^Ton'T as ^e frontier line between Russia and Persia. whole course of tuLiVerfwhLh wal vltuX P Sead t ex P editioi f ^ f 6 would be the maintenance’of the IlL Sf 7 Persla “ ^ry, what value without' 3e n0 satisfactory maintenance of the status quo without a fixed delimitation of the Russian frontier. Loftus'aTmeared^o^rpou? 1 ! 16 ' 1 thls ar § u ™ ent observing that Lord A. JuOltus appealed to require more than Lord Derby, who had onlv desired the maintenance of the status quo. He said that it was ti .°f 1 y . cleslrea Z 'maintenance^'oF the ^ ^ ^ ^ “ d ^ “it* establish a perfect understanding ^between the^two^Governments! 8 ^ “ t0The allusion to an occupation of Quettah attracted the notice both of the Secretary of State and the Government of India. Lord Salisbury advised that, without entering at all into the merits of the question, the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg should be reminded of the clause * in the Treaty * . ^ 7 TTr of 1854 with the Khan of Khelat which * Article IV .— ‘ Should ifc be deemed necessary , , T&gt; . . . ^ , to station British troops in any part of the territory secured to the British Government the of Khe ] at they shau occupy such positions as may right of stationing troops in any part of be thought advisable by the British authorities. T g , . 0 1 ^ ^ j m Khelat territory. The Government ot India proposed that this information should also be communicated to the Russian Government. In August 1875 the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg was instructed accordingly. He was also desired to add that the British Government had no intention of using their right unless a necessity arose. In a conversation with Baron Jomini at the end of September Mr. Horia repeated his instructions' with the following results :— “ Baron Jomini replied that his Government did not contest England^ right to station troops there, but that they considered it would be an impolitic act to make use of it, as Khelat was looked upon as a sort of outpost to Herat. His Excellency continued that in his opinion neither Russia nor England would find advantage in being mutually bound by promises in matters concerning Central Asia, England would no doubt take possession of Khelat if it were necessary for her policy, and she was quite right to do so. “ His Excellency finished the conversation by repeating what he has often uttered before, that to suppose Russia would attack British India was to consider her devoid of all common judgment. What reason can she have for wishing to overthrow England’s dominion in India? It was far more to the mutual advantage of both to work together in their arduous work of civilization where there is space for the exertions of both.'” \Secret, June, November, December 1875, Nos. 161-166, 50-51, 1-3.J 3. Prince GortschakofF’s review of the understanding between England and Russia in regard to Central Asia and Afghanistan. —In April 1875 Prince Gortschakoff addressed the following despatch to Count Schouvaloff, Russian Ambassador in London, enclosing a memorandum of the views of the Imperial Cabinet on Russian policy in Central Asia. This memorandum reviewed all the correspondence which has passed between the two Governments since the Russian Circular, dated 31st November 1864, and recorded a determination of the Czar not to extend the frontier of Russia beyond its present limits either on the side of Bokhara or on that of Krasnovodsk and the Attrek. “ M. le Comte. St. Petersbourg, le 5 Avril, 1875. “ Je crois devoir completer mes precedentes depeches par uu expose des vues gerierales du Cabinet Imperial sur PAsie Centrale. “ II resalte clairement de la notice historique developpant la marche de nos pourparlers avec le Cabinet de Londres que les limites de Piufluence appartenaut aux deux Gouvernements sont nettement tracees par Paccord intervenu entre eux. “ Determines a maintenir cette limite intacte, nous considerons les deux Gouvernements comme ayant conserve leur pleine liberte d’action dans les contrees qui les avoisinent, et qui se trouvent placees en dehors de cette ligne. Tous deux n’ont a envisager, a cet egard, que leurs propres interets et leurs propres necessites. “ Pour ce qui nous concerne, nous avons pris en serieuse consideration les vceux qui nous ont ete a plusieurs reprises exprimes par le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique, en vue de maintenir dans son esprit, aussi bien que dans sa lettre, Pentente pacifique etablie entre nous. “ Sa Majeste PEmpereur a daigne ordonner de reunir pour Pexamen de ces questions un Comite auquel vous avez pris part. “Votre Excellence a ete a meme de recueillir de la bouche meme de notre auguste Maitre Pexpression de sa volonte.“ This deduction from the course of past negotiations must be made under some misappre hension, since in April 1869 Lord Clarendon, * Lord Clarendon to Mr. Rumbold, 17th April 1869. “ It was therefore thought advisable to propose that the Upper Oxus, which was south of Bokhara, should he the boundary line which neither Power should permit their forces to cross. This, I said, would leave a large tract of country, apparently desert, and marked in the map before us (Weller’s map) as belonging to the Khan of Khiva, be tween Afghanistan and the territory already acquired by Kussia, and,- if agreed to, would, it might be hoped, remove all fear of future dissension.” f Despatch from Government of India, No. 177, dated 3rd June 1869, of which copy sent to Foreign Office, 15th August 1872. after reference to this Office, distinctly in formed Baron Brunnow that Afghanistan would not fulfill the desired conditions, and substituted for his original suggestion in regard to a neutral zone a proposal* that the Upper Oxus should form the boundary line which neither Power should permit their forces to cross. This was followed by a protest from Lord Mayors Governmentf against the proposal of a neutral zone, the idea of which was thenceforward, so far . as the English Government was concerned, definitively . abandoned. Although the subject was subsequently touched upon in the course of explanations between the Russian Ministers and Mr. Forsyth during that gentleman’s visit to St Petersburg, its discussion was not, and was not intended to be, one of the objects of his mission.” Secondly, the course of negotiations which led to the definition of the limits of Afghanistan. Upon this point he wrote :— “ Lord Salisbury considers that there are no grounds for the labored inference drawn in the memorandum that the limits agreed upon in 1869 as being in the f effective possession’ of Shere Ah did not include Badakshan and M^akhan, and that the Russian Government finally con ceded the point as an act of courtesy. “ The matter was one of plain historical fact. “On the death of Dost Mahomed in 1863, Shere Ali Khan inherited his father’s king dom, which included within its boundaries Badakshan, Wakhan, and the districts known as Afghan-Turkestan. Although subsequent internal rebellion caused the Chiefs of these outlying territories to waver in their allegiance from one member of the Afghan Royal Family to another, they at no period attempted to make themselves independent of Afghanistan, or to offer their allegiance to Bokhara or other foreign Power. AUhen Shere All regained supreme power in 1869-70, the whole of these Chiefs, including the Meer of Badakshan, renewed their personal allegiance to him in the most full and entire manner; and when, in December 1869, the Russian Government agreed to recognise as Afghanistan the territory then under Shere Ali’s effective control, he had been for nearly a year in complete possession of Cabul, Herat, Candahar, Afghan-Turkestan, Badakshan, and Wakhan. The enquiries made at the time by the Government of India left no doubt whatever as to these material facts, and their conclu sions were in no way shaken by those in a different sense formed by General Kauffmann. “ Lord Salisbury cannot imagine therefore that the final agreement of the Russian Cabinet to the line of demarcation proposed in Lord Granville’s despatch of the 17th October 1872 was, or ever will be, looked upon by the English Cabinet otherwise than as a recognition of a fact which had never really admitted of question.” Thirdly, that the agreement arrived at between the two Powers has left to Russia full liberty of action upon every portion of territory situated between the Russian frontiers and Afghanistan without any apparent right of remon strance on the part of the English Government. Lord Salisbury observed :— “ By this assumption His Imperial Majesty’s present declarations of the sincerity, of which there can be no doubt, are qualified to a grave extent. It must not be forgotten in the consideration of this important question that declarations as specific and as sincere have been followed on former occasions by acts inconsistent with their tenor; indeed the memorandum itself dwells on a justification of this course of policy under the plea of necessity. Lord Salisbury neither desires to raise bygone questions touching that necessity, nor to enter into any examination of the policy to which it may have given rise; he merely wishes to express his fear that, if the present claim be allowed to pass unchallenged, it may, sooner or later, lead to complications affecting Indian interests in regard to Merv, which may seriously embar rass Her Majesty’s Government. It must be borne in mind that the establishment of Russian supremacy in Khiva and on the south-eastern coast of the Caspian has taken place since the course of negotiations described in the general body of the memorandum, whilst the occupation of the Attrek districts by Russian troops may at any time materially affect our relations with Persia. On these and other considerations it is inexpedient, if not impossible, in Lord Salis bury’s opinion, for Her Majesty’s Government to accept the position of inaction which Prince Gortschakoff’s letter apparently wishes to force upon it, whatever may be the character of future operations by Russia against the Turkomans.”( 6 ) 5. Opinion of the Government of India.-The reply of the Government of India containing the opinion upon the question laid before them was conveyed in the following despatch, dated 23rd August 18/o. They concurred entirely in the views expressed by Lord Salisbury, and said “In respect to the questions of a neutral zone between the possessions of Russia and the Indian Empire, and of Afghanistan as constituting such a neutral zone, we need do no more than invite the attention of Her Majesty's Government to our despatch No GO dated 30th June 1873. This despatch, as we learned from the letter from the Lnder-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, to the Under-Secretary of State, India Office, dated 25th August 1873, was not communicated to the Russian Grovernment. “ Paragraphs 14 and 15 of our despatch of the 30th June 1873 placed the question of a neutral zone in a correct light. The idea of snch a zone was not pursued^ Gecause^ on the one hand. Lord Clarendon objected to Afghanistan being considered the neutral territory; and on the other hand; Prince Gortschakoff objected to the alternative suggestion made by Lord Cla rendon that the Upper Oxus should be adopted as the line of demarcation for a neutral territory. Although the subject was subsequently mentioned at St. i eteisburg; it was not revived as a basis for negotiations; and as we intimated to the Secretary of State in our des patch No. 21, dated 5th April 1872— f We had inferred from the conversation between Mr. Forsyth and M. Stremounkoff on 30th October 1869 that the Russian Ministers had definitely abandoned the scheme, on the very ground that some of the provinces, such as Balkh, Koon- dooz, and Badakshan, which it was proposed to neutralize, formed part of the territories of Afghanistan/ “We have noted with satisfaction the pacific assurances which Prince Gortschakoff has been instructed to communicate as to the intentions of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia. And we regret that those assurances should have been qualified by the assumption that the understanding arrived at has left the Russian Government full liberty of action upon all territory situated between the Russian frontiers and Afghanistan, and the British Government is apparently regarded as debarred from the right of remonstrance, should Russia deem it expedient to advance up to the limits of Afghanistan. It has always been our contention that the specific arrangements in reference to Afghanistan rested on the basis of the friendly and peaceful assurances given by Prince Gortschakoff to Lord Clarendon in September 1869, that ^extension of territory was extension of weakness/ and that 'Russia had no intention of going further south*; by His Majesty the Emperor to Mr. Forsyth, that 'there was no intention of extending the Russian dominions j and by Count Schouvaloff to Her IMajesty^s Ambassador at St. Petersburg on 22nd January 1873, that ' there was no intention to incorporate Khiva, nor to extend the Russian possessions in Central Asia/ Such are the assurances with which the understanding between the two Governments on the affairs of Central Asia is inseparably bound up If this essential point be ignored or explained away, the engagements which have been concluded m regard to Afghanistan are deprived of their true value, and the British Government would be at liberty to adopt whatever policy beyond the limits of Afghanistan the circumstances oL each case, as it arises, may he deemed to require. t a - “P how ® ve L more especially with reference to the responsibility of the Government of Government ° £ ^ Ameer ° £ A %' ianistaQ that our opinion is required by Her Majesty’s The ^eneral sense in which the Government of India acknowledges its responsibility in P the eternal policy of Afelui- nI f a '\ has beea M'T explained rathe undertake no further responsibility with regard to the aotinn hr T Can than to press upon him in ease of need in the 0n of the f meer advice, and to govern our relations towards him in acoordTac^withUheT t^' y act^fthSa^tS^ ^ ^eng^To the Ame^rd^Son^whil^ontSfoMhanT^ S r tIed iS t0 be tlle lirait of to use all the influence they possessVith ^heVme Go ' rermnent °f India are transgressing that boundary Russia will nn he ® r 4° preV , e , nt him tVo «i over Bokhara and the other States to which her influent ^ he / lnttaence them from aggressions on Afghanistan The.-efe d 1 ei p e extends to restrain fines himself to the boundary now defined he need aS 'Z® Ameer con - Russta or the countries under her influence ’ ” d te a ° moIestatl °n from extracts marginally noted from our despatch dated 30th June 1873. And the action taken by us from time to time has been guided by the views therein set forth. The 10th paragraph of .the same despatch states generally what had been done to dissuade the Ameer from interference in the affairs of his neighbours. Khan has evinced no tendency whatp™,. Hls Highness the Ameer Shere AH his own dominions. In our despatch No L d 1 movements bey on(1 the of of Your Lordship certain measuTes whwh ^ .7 1^5, we brought to the notice consolidation of the Ameer’s authnntv ,Vf e cont pmplated by the Cabul Durbar for the out that, as Maimena is within the re witzed e pn “ CipalA 7 f Maimena. But we also pointed for interference with these proceedings^ d 11163 ° f A % hanis tan, there was no reasonff No opportunity, however, has been lost of tendering to the Ameer from time to time such counsel as seemed best adapted to secure the interests of peace. Thus, when Syud Noor Mahomed Shah, Envoy from His Highness, visited India in 1873, the necessity for the Ameeris Government abstaining from encroachment and aggression on their neiedibours was stromriv urged on him. &amp; “ On the subject of the Turkomans also, in their relations with the Ameer of Afghanistan, our policy has been such as to anticipate the wishes expressed in the letter from Prince Gort- schakoff: to Count Schouvaloft, dated 5th April 1875. When, on the occasion above mentioned, Syud ksoor Mahomed enquired how the Ameer should advise the Turkomans as to the attitude which they should adopt towards the Russian expeditionary forces, the Viceroy replied that the Ameer should not accept responsibility for the Turkomans, or countenance their lawless pro ceedings oi any opposition on their part to the march of the Russian troops. He also approved the obseivations that had already been made by the Foreign Secretary in conversation with the Envoy, namely, that, f while maintaining with the Turkomans relations of peace, the Ameer should on no account assist them in opposing the Russians. If the Ameer thought it neces sary to give the Tekkes advice, it should be to the effect that they should allow an unmolested passage to the Russians, and in no way whatever interfere with their operations/ Our Agent at Cabul, m a letter dated 5th July 187o, has reported the following remark as having been made to him in conversation by Ameer Shere Ali Khan 'When the son of Koosheed &amp; Khan (Chief of Merv Shahjehan) waited on me, I exhorted and advised him not to stand against the Russians. It thus appears that the advice given by the Government of India on the subject of the Turkomans has been respected and followed by the Ameer of Afghanistan. “ Your Lordship will observe from our despatch, dated 28th June 1875, that we have recently taken a step in the same direction by counselling the Ameer of Cabul to advise the Tekke tribes, if he is in a position to do so, to release the Russian prisoner who was believed to be in theii hands, and to assume a peaceful attitude towards merchants and others passing through or near their territories. 'We shall continue to pursue this course of action whenever circumstances appear to call for it.” [Secret, November 1875, Nos. 12-16.] 5A. Reply of the British Government to Prince Gorts- chakoff’s despatch and memorandum of April 1875— After the question had thus been fully discussed the following memorandum in reply to that prepared by Prince Gortschakoff was forwarded to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg for presentation to the Bussian Government. In communicat ing the memorandum Lord A. Loftus was desired to explain that the remarks in it were not offered in any spirit of controversy, but in the cordial desire to meet the evident wish of the Czar that no cause for misapprehension should exist in regard to the policy and intentions of the two Governments :— “ Memorandum on Russian policy in Central Asia, in reply to that enclosed in Prince Gortschakoef’s despatch to Count Schouvaloff of 11th May 1875. ' Her Majesty's Government have given their careful consideration to the Memorandum on Russian policy in Central Asia, which formed the enclosure to Prince Gortschakoff's despatch to Count Schouvaloff of the 11th May last. ' In thus presenting for examination an historical review of the communications which have passed between the Governments of Russia and England, and in reviewing a statement of their sentiments and policy on this important question. Her Majesty's Government gladly recognize the desire of the Imperial Government to avert cause of future misunderstandin 0 * by a friendly interchange of views. Hei Majesty s Government feel that they will best respond to the wishes of the Imperial Government in addressing to them this communication, by calling attention to certain state-( 7 « ) meats and passages in the memorandum which appear to Her Majesty’s Government not to correspond with their appreciation of past transactions, or w.th the understanding which it is alike the interest of both Governments to keep in view. “In these observations Her Majesty's Government desire to avoid all reference to points of minor importance, and will confine themselves to those questions upon which it is obviously necessary that no obscurity or misapprehension should be allowed to exist on either side. “ The Memorandum refers to an agreement of opinion between the Chancellor of the Empire and Lord Clarendon, on the occasion of their interview at Heidelberg in 1869, £ founded on the maintenance by Russia and England of an intermediary zone,’ destined to separate their Asiatic possessions; adding that in c this order of ideas it was understood that Afghanistan should form an independent State which should remain outside the sphere of Russian action/ “ The interview in question took place after confidential communications between Lord Clarendon and Baron Brunnow, at that time Russian Ambassador in London, on the same subject. “ It appears from the correspondence which took place at this period, that the c inter mediary' zone, then under consideration, was intended on both sides to be at the same time a c neutral' zone; and from this point of view, Lord Clarendon distinctly informed Baron Brunnow, in April T869, while thanking the Russian Government for the friendly feelings which had dictated the communication, that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for India, £ Afghanistan would not fulfil those conditions of a neutral territory which it was the object of the two Governments to establish, as the frontiers were ill-defined; and if the Russian forces advanced to those frontiers, disputes with the Chiefs on the border would sooner or later, but infallibly, ensue, and Russia might be compelled, however unwillingly, to disre gard the arrangement she had entered into; and it was, therefore, thought advisable to pro pose that the upper Oxus, which was south of Bokhara, should be the boundary line, which neither Power should permit their forces to cross. This would leave a large tract of country apparently desert, and marked on the map as belonging to the Khan of Khiva, between Afghanistan and the territory already acquired by Russia, and, if agreed to, would, it might be hoped, remove all fear of future dissension/ Phis proposal, as is correctly stated in the memorandum, was declined by the Imperial Government, on the ground that it gave an extension to the frontiers of Afghanistan, which they could not admit; and this negative answer put an end to the confidential communications between the Russian Ambassabor and Lord Clarendon, on the question of a f neutral zone/ . “ But the memorandum goes on to say that, after being definitively closed in London, tins questron was reopened at St. Petersburg!! by Mr. Forsyth, on the occasion of his visit in . \ , a \ as a lcsi dt of the exchange of views between that functionary and the Im perial Cabinet, it was £ agreed':— 1. that the territories in the actual possession of Shere All should forming the limits of Afghanistan. those limits anVlr exereise an y influence or any interference beyo any ag^fattempt ° “ Sh ° UU ^ ^ t0 him fr ' the Ameer of ^okhara^re th&lt;i ’i '' 1 ’ 6 ™ 1 Govemmeilt employ all its influence to restr. tue Ameer ot Bokhara from making any attack on Afghan territory. may ira™ Wn “ufe” ^r™* think 14 -mark that whiter Imperia/caMnet^ H^thrme/no^part of °his .

But it is apparent from the resume of the agreement given at the close of the memorandum, and the paragraphs which follow, that the Imperial Cabinet is of opinion that in arriving at an under standing with respect to Afghanistan the common policy of the two Governments has been completely fulfilled, and that it is a part of such understanding that entire liberty of action is left to Russia in all the territories lying between her own frontier and that of Afghanistan. It is with reference to this opinion that it is essential that the views of Her Majesty’s Government should be clearly explained. “The point of departure of the two Governments in exchanging their views was the mutual desire to arrive at some common understanding as to the best means of preventing the contact of their respective possessions in Central Asia. “Various combinations were proposed and discussed with this object—the creation of a neutral zone, the delimitation of frontiers, the recognition of the Oxus as a line which neither Power should permit their forces to cross, the maintenance of Afghanistan and Bokhara as independent States, the former under British, and the latter under Russian influence. “ This last combination, as represented in the memorandum under consideration, appears to be the only form of an arrangement with regard to which any definite understanding has been found practicable, and Her Majesty’s Government have always fully appreciated the conciliatory spirit in which this question has been approached by the Russian Government. “ But it is obvious that the settlement made with respect to Afghanistan can only partially effect the object which the two Governments desired to attain, namely, that of averting possible causes of future collision between them. “Her Majesty’s Government fully accept the assurances of the Imperial Cabinet as to the extension of the southern frontiers of Russian territory; but they equally admit the force of the arguments which have been advanced to explain the repeated annexations which, in spite of these assurances, have taken place. “ However sincere, therefore, the desire of the Russian Government to avoid future exten sion of territorial responsibilities. Her Majesty’s Government cannot regard the present line of Russian frontier as fixed and immovable. The recurrence of similar causes may lead to similar results, and Her Majesty’s Government could not regard with indifference, and as a matter with which they have no concern, further occupation and absorption by Russia of the regions which still separate Afghanistan from the Russian territory. “ The grounds of the apprehensions entertained by Her Majesty’s Government on this subject have been so fully stated on former occasions, that it is only necessary now to refer to previous communications, and particularly to Lord Granville’s despatch to Lord A. Loftus of 7th January 1874, which discusses them at length. “ Whatever may be the ultimate destiny of Russia in the course of its civilizing mission in Central Asia, it is impossible not to see that, in view of the present conditions of the Turkoman tribes, of the relations in which they stand to the Ruler of Afghanistan on the one hand, and those between that Ruler and the Government of India on the other, that each successive advance of the Russian frontier towards Afghanistan may involve complications, which it is equally the interest of both England and Russia to avoid, and may raise up the most serious obstacles to the continued pursuance of the policy which has hitherto guided both powers alike to maintain intact the integrity of Afghan territory.( lc ) « This is an object to which Her Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance, and they must reserve to themselves the most complete liberty o£ action under all future contingencies as to the measures which may, in their opinion be necessary to secure it they cannot but feel that such an event, for instance, as the occupation of Merv, which would bring the line of Russian territory into direct contact with Afghan territory, would arouse the sus ceptibilities of the Ameer to the highest degree, and possibly involve him m a common course of defensive action with the Turkoman tribes upon his borders. Under such circumstances, it is unnecessary to observe how difficult it might me for the Imperial Government to main- tain a policy of strict abstention in accordance with its present assurances, or how impossible it might be for Her Majesty’s Government to exert any effectual control over the actions of the Ameer, without undertaking responsibilities which they would most reluctantly assume, and which would virtually involve the very result which both Governments dosiie to avert, viz., the contact of the two powers in Central Asia. i&lt; Whatever may be the desire of both Governments to act in concert in bringing' the agencies of civilization to bear upon the wild and predatory races of the regions which separate their dominions, the time has not arrived when such a co-operation could be made intelligible to the rulers and people of the Khanates. “ The presence of two centres of European power and influence in their midst would wear in their eyes an aspect of mutual menace and rivalry, and encourage hopes and speculations unfavourable to the growth of the relations between England and Russia which are an im portant condition of success in the task on which both are engaged, each in their separate sphere, of maintaining order and promoting civilization in their Asiatic possessions. “ Nor can it be denied that the atmosphere of suspicion, intrigue and discord, which would surround the military authorities of both powers, might at any time provoke an attitude of reciprocal distrust which might frustrate the wishes, and defeat the deliberate policy of their respective Governments, and react perniciously on the public opinion of Russia on the one hand, and of England and India on the other. “It is for these reasons that Her Majesty's Government have always deprecated the further extension of Russian territory towards the Afghan borders, and that they have now received with the most sincere satisfaction the assurances conveyed in Prince GortschakofFs despatch as to the enlightened conviction of His Imperial Majesty's that such extension, either on the side of Bokhara, of Krasnovodsk, or of the Attrek, is contrary to Russian interests, and that formal orders have been given that all future action in those regions is to be strictly confined to the defence of existing limits and the protection of property and commerce from pillage and brigandage.' Baron Jomini, to whom the memorandum was delivered, observed after reading it that all points which might give rise to sterile discussions had been omitted, and expressed great satisfaction at its friendly tone and conciliatory spirit. Subsequently, on the 3rd-15th February 1876, Prince Gortschakoff wrote as follows on the subject to Count Schouvaloff, the Hussian Ambassador m London :— ^ a i 1 B ™V CVCUI a P l i g connaissanee avec un vif interet du memo, aeeompaffnant une t e f„ e toLe e im 0 p tiffi. 0rby ' d0Ut L °‘' d A ' L ° £tl ’ S “ ^ leCt ' e “ m5n absence dl1 ehW C1 ' PreS COple i e . cette P® 06 &lt; l ui sert dc reponse a la notice que V.

Debate in the House of Commons on Central Asian affairs with reference to Russian occupation of Khiva— Session Of 1875—On 6tli July 1875 Mr. Baillie Cochrane called the attention of the House of Commons to the progress of Russia in Central Asia, and moved for copies of papers relating to the occupation of the Khanate of Khiva by the Russians. In reply, Mr. R. Bourke, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, made the following speech :— “ With regard to the motion of his hon. friend, he could not undertake, on behalf of the Government, to lay upon the table any papers relating to the Treaty of Khiva other than those which were already in possession of the House. Communications and .despatches had passed between Her Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government in relation to the general question of Central Asia, but they were not as yet ripe for publication. When the proper time came the documents would be laid before Parliament, and he felt sure that the country would approve the course taken by the Government in not prematurely statino- the nature of the communications which had passed. (Hear, hear.) It was only nedessary at present to say further that the most friendly relations existed between the two Governments. (Hear hear.) It was not his intention to follow his hon. friend in a geographical survey of the progress of Russia in the East, for the reason that through the public prints and other agencies the public were fully informed upon that point; but his hon. friend was altogether in error in supposing that either the Government or Parliament treated the subject with perfect indifference. (Hear.') He differed from his hon. friend in regarding the progress of Russia in Turkestan as a tidal wave which was sweeping over the country. On the other hand, the progress of Russia had been remarkably slow, and had cost her a vast amount of blood and treasure. As far as the Khivan business was concerned, he supposed that no one understanding the subject would contend that Russia had kept the engagements into which she entered with regard to this matter.. (Hear, hear.) This point ought not to be lost sight of; but it was one lipon which, for obvious reasons, he should be unwise in dwelling at the present moment. His hon. friend was undoubtedly right in urging the importance of England keeping up communication with India. With regard to the Suez Canal, there could be no doubt of its importance and advantage to this country, both from a commercial and a political point of view; but it was equally clear that England had also proved of great advantage to the Canal, for of the ships which passed through, 70 per cent, were English vessels. Every one must wish success to the undertaking; but no one, he thought, would contend that England ought to enter upon international arrange ments with regard to the Canal which would only end in embarrassing her. (Hear, hear.) Nor did he think it would be good policy to sanction any arrangement which might have the effect of infringing the territorial rights of the Khedive. As for the Euphrates Valley Railway, he was quite sure England would be one of its best customers, and that Turkey as well as England would benefit by it. The hon. member who last spoke advocated a policy of masterly inactivity. The phrase was one which had frequently been heard in Indian politics. Whether that was a wise policy to pursue depended entirely on circumstances, and he should be sorry, therefore, to commit himself to it. Most of the hon. members who had spoken had been asked what was to be done. Now it had never been the policy of this country to declare beforehand what course it would adopt under hypothetical circumstances or upon conditions( 8 ) S wn* well known upon the subject before the which did not exist. (Hear, hear. Our P '^'n the direction of Cental Asia. We House. We had no esne ° a “““ • -g ] all( j tj, a t a reasonable distance should thought it was the mterest of both Bussra and Lu ta d be a da in the futm , intervene between our respective frontiers. Iheic might no uo a of the two nations drifting towards one another, as was pointed out many j ears ago by Count Nesselrode and we thought that the policy of both countries ought to be to prevent that iNesselroae, 0 that a formal recognition of a great neutral territory Tewr the two em h^ioh might°limit the advance of each and be scrupulously respected by both, would be a desirable arrangement, and a correspondence took place upon the subject the particulars of whiel. had been laid before Parliament but that correspondence did not lead to any agreement as to the limits of that neutral territory; and when it was proposed hat Afo-hanistan should constitute the zone, the Government of India could not entertain that proposition. As to the present position of affairs, he would observe that since the idea of a neutral territory was first advanced there bad been many territorial changes, which materially alters* the condition of things. Any binding engagement as to a certain defined neutral territory at the present time would be likely to lead to a mis understanding and difficulty That an agreement that one empire should exercise what had been called political influence within ascertain sphere, and that the other empire should exercise similar influence within another sphere, would he an unwise arrangement for two reasons. In the first place it was very difficult to define what political influence meant, and misnndei standings might anse as to whether either country was or was not fulfilling its engagements to the others. Secondly, in a country like Central Asia, where boundaries were ill-defined and little known, where nomad tribes existed, who never were accustomed to regard boundaries very scrupulously, where government in the European sense is not to be found, where the inhabitants are turbulent, lawless, and fanatical, it would he difficult, and perhaps impossible, for either empire so to control events as to be responsible to the other for occurrences which took place beyond its own frontiers. Under these circumstances, while they approved the principle which dictated the policy of a neutral zone, it was not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to enter into any formal arrangement or agreement upon the basis of a neutral territory in the European sense of the term. They looked upon the status quo without apprehension. As he had said, there was no desire to advance our frontiers, and so long as the present state of things remained substantially the same, Her Majesty’s Government did not intend to countenance any such policy. We had given innumerable proofs to those States which abutted on our Indian empire, that we desired them to he powerful, peaceable, and independent. We wish to show them that we were not an aggressive power. We had long been united to them by friendly ties. We would not enter into any engagement which might prejudice their interests or our own, or hamper our freedom of action with respect to them, and we held ourselves at liberty to enter into alliance with those States, according to those considerations, financial, political and strate gical, which we might from time to time consider wise and prudent. It was not for him to speak of the foreign policy of the Government of India. He should be trenching upon the pro vince of his noble friend, the Under-Secretary of State for India, were he to do so. He might however say that establishment of the most friendly relations with Afghanistan was no new policy. It was advocated by Lord Canning before Dost Mahomed died. It was carried out by Lord Lawrence; it was acted upon by Lord Lawrence’s successor. It was secured at the Umballa Conference, and the fruits of that Conference were that Afghanistan was stronger now than it had ever been since the days of Dost Mahomed. (Hear, hear.) The development of that policy was a woik of time, and depended a great deal upon the amount of confidence we inspired by means of personal influence in the minds of the Native Chiefs and rulers. And when freedom of intercourse was more fully established between us and them, we might hope that old suspicions and old animosities might be subdued, and that our motives would be more appreciated by the wild and warlike tribes which inhabited Afghanistan. (Hear, hear.) If that policy was carried out with firmness, conciliation, and perseverance, it was that most calculated to preserve the peace of Central Asia. (Hear, hear.) It was a policy which could give no um xage to any Power in the W'orld. If Russia was anxious, as he was sure she was to develop the resources of her dominion in Turkestan, she would attain that object by allowing a peaceful commerce to spring up between India and Turkestan, which, if left to its natural course, would enormously profit both empires, and would cement that friendship still more strongly which now happily existed between the two great empires of Asia.” [DabaU m //. 0 f C., Overland Mail, dated 9th July 1875.]c 7. Opinion in Russia and India on Mr. Bourke’s speech.— The policy announced by Mr. Bourke was approved both in India and Russia. The Calcutta Englishman^ dated 2nd August 1875, observed :— “ Such a policy is not capable of being condensed into an epigram like the masterly inactivity of Lord Lawrence's school. But it strikes us as a policy at once just and provident, and the House of Commons and the outside public seem to have agreed that it is the policy which one great Christian Power can with most dignity adopt to another great Christian Power among the half-barbarous Muhammadan States of Asia.' And, after drawing attention to the increase of Russian railroads as affording a greater menace to England in the East than Russian conquests, it concluded :— “ It is simply out of the question for a mercantile country like England to attempt to arrest a policy of commercial development such as Russia has now sketched out. The sense of the whole civilized world would be against us. It only remains for British Ministers and Indian Statesmen to hear vigilantly in mind that this policy of commercial development has another aspect pointing to military enterprise and territorial aggrandisement.' Erom St. Petersburg, Mr. Doria reported the following conversation with Baron Jomiui, and subsequently adverted to an article in the Journal de St. Petersbourg, which so exactly reproduced Baron Jo mini’s opinions as to be naturally attributed to his pen. The following is the conversation :— “ His Excellency began by expressing his entire participation and accordance in the opinions and views of Her Majesty's Government as announced to the House by the Hon'ble R. Bourke, I might almost say approval of the speech of Her Majesty's Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. “ His Excellency informed me that he had drawn up all the official papers upon this sub ject emanating from the Russian Foreign Office; that at first a neutral zone had been talked of and proposed as a limit to the advance of both empires, but, he added, a neutral zone is an impossibility in a territory of barbarians,—Belgium, he said, can be considered a neutral country, because civilized and in a position to respect certain acknowledged international rights, which are frequently entirely disregarded by the various turbulent tribes of Central Asia; that to enforce upon them a respect for the maintenance of peace often entailed on Russia a necessity of direct interference, doing away with the professions of the existence of a neutral zone which could only be maintained in a moral sense. “ But the main point of His Excellency's conversation went to show the fixed idea exist ing in his mind that the British and Russian Empires must eventually become limitrophe; His Excellency repeated the opinion that if the Empires of Russia and Austria or Germany, having a common frontier can exist on terms of peace, why not England and Russia ? And His Excel lency said, if England found it to her interests to annex Afghanistan to her Indian Empire, the Russian Government would not regard it as a menace to them, nor would they endeavour to prevent it, and that therefore they cannot comprehend why the future absorption of Bokhara and Kokand should raise such excitement and alarm in the minds of Englishmen. “ I think that Baron Jomini viewed with satisfaction the statement that the correspond ence between Her Majesty's Government and that of Russia had not led to any agreement as to the limits of a neutral zone. I have arrived at his conviction that many Russians, and amongst them men of political position and in Government service, entertain the full persua sion that the maintenance for any number of years of a great neutral territory between the two Empires of Russia and India is an impossibility, and that the notion must be abandoned.' Tbe article above alluded to advised “that it is for the interests of both England and Russia to convince the Mussulman population of Asia that they have laid aside their mutual mistrust and rivalry (defiance et rivaute) where there is place for all; that this persuasion, if forced upon the disaffected races of Asia, will disappoint their hopes and expectations, while the progress of England and Russia will be a mutual benefit and support to each other, and it depends only on England to bring it about.' On the other hand mutual hostility would produce circumstances of far more grave importance for the rule of England in India, and than that of Russia in Central Asia. [Secret, September 1875, Nos. 110-123.] 8. Second Debate in the House of Commons on Central Asian affairs and Russian annexation of Kokand. Session of( 10 ) 1876.—In May 1876 Mr. BaUlie Coctone to rnc^ of ( « and asked for the r^^X/L^rtant debate 3 followed and many inter- year, - _ of the Khanate of Kokand. ir ' rlehate bein' summed by Mr. Disraeli who esting speeches were delivered, the debate uein 0 j spoke as follows :— “ My hon. friend the Member for brought forward one the Isle of Wight incident occurs which adds, of course, increased interest to Our attention is called to this question of our (Mr. Baillie Cochrane) has o£ those interesting annual motions upon the state of our Indian Empire which always receive the attention of the House, and of winch rt may be sa,d that almost every year some new my hon. friend's statements ant s P®^ a ^ n ®j cnt recently by Russia of the Khanate of Indian Empire ^“Spated,'I think, by those who have Kokand. Now that .snot an event which wa^^ ^ the perioa of the conquest of given much attention J mus t | ]a , ve felt that it was almost inevitable that all ISy depended of course on the conduct of the inhabitants of those countries themselves. fTh nk that in the present instance they precipitated their fate by constant attempts to struoode against Russikattempts which I am far from washing in any way to discredit as they probably add much to their honour and patnotism-but which unfortunately brought about the termination of their political independence, which might otherwise haye lasted some time This event after all is one which was anticipated and is in a direction of country that is not peculiarly menacing to those Imperial interests which engage our attention. My hon. friend has called our consideration to what he conceives to be the serious consequences of tins event and of others of a similar character which may follow upon our position m India. My hon. friend has substantiated his views by quoting from several individuals, some of them known, and men no doubt, of talent and experience, but all utterly irresponsible in the opinions which they have given. One of them is anonymous, and that I think was the opinion on which my hon friend seemed to lay the greatest stress. That was the opinion of the gentleman who thought that this advance of Russia into Central Asia ought to be nipped in the hud. Now nipping in the hud means that the English power should have proceeded beyond our Indian boundary, should have crossed some deserts with which we have since become familiar, and should have entered upon one of the most hazardous, and I should say, one of the most unwise struggles that could well he conceived. Well, then, my hon.. friend says that we ought to come to some'understanding'with Russia. That is a very vague word, and I do not know that our ' understandings' with Russia, which have sometimes upon these subjects assumed the character of promises which it seems were never given, have ever been realized. My hon. friend in his speech seemed to me to treat the scheme of a neutral zone as one ivhich had been brought into practice and had been sanctioned by the two great Powers of Russia and Great Britain. But the fact is that the neutral zone was a speculation in a diplomatic despatch, nothing more. It never was accepted at any Conference or Congress, nor was it ever expressed in any Protocol or Treaty. The idea that Great Britain and Russia agreed to establish a neutral zone between their respective empires, and that Russia has all this time systematically violated the neutral zone that was agreed upon, is one of those delusions wEich, iiaving once got possession of the public mind, it is very difficult to terminate. The fact is that no neutral zone was ever agreed upon by the Statesmen of the different Powers. With regard to understandings, there w 7 as an understanding about Khiva; but we must all admit that that was a most unfortunate understanding, because no two persons ever agreed as to what that understanding was. Therefore I am far from wishing to enter into any under standing with Russia to prevent those fears and apprehensions of which we have heard so much, and on which I may make a remark. The hon. and learned gentleman who made an interesting speech in seconding the motion of my hon. friend certainly contributed much to the debate, but he did not enforce particularly the views of my hon. friend. I must say that, although I should he proud on a fitting occasion to have the hon. and learned Member for Marylebone for a seconder, it he made as good a speech as he has delivered to-night, stdl I would rather that he should support the policy I was recommending to the House instead of laying down that the conquest of Kokand was perfectly justifiable, and not in the least mjuiious, and stating that he should look forward with satisfaction to the conquest of Kashgar, lhat was not the kind of support which my hon. friend, the Member for the Isle of Wight, might fairly have expected. The hon. and gallant gentleman who has just sat down (bir Henry Havelock) presses upon us the importance of establishing a substantial boundary to the great frontier State of Afghanistan. I believe that Her Majesty's Govern- ment are perfectly conscious of the importance of establishing the best relations with g i an is an an o c iciis ung those relations; but although we are most anxious for the prosperity the peace, and the power of Afghanistan, still we cannot be blind to the very unsatisfactory state of its present government. We know that there are many who wish to w ic is very ™ uc to he deprecated and that there are many aspirants to power, not a state ot affairs which can, in our opinion, be remedied by force. It is by be masters But thatcultivating friendly relations; it is by cherishing communications^ which have been rarer than we could wish, but which, I hope, are increasing; and it is by commercial influence to a great degree that we could most gradually obtain that position in Afghanistan which, I believe, wmuld be a natural position for us if both countries were equally conscious of the independence, the security, and the peace that are involved in that relation. My hon. friend, the Member for the Isle of Wight, asks me whether I am prepared to grant the papers which he requires. Now these papers are of two kinds. He wants copies of all correspondence between Her Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government respecting this occupation of Kokand. Well, there are none. Then he wants the reports of Captain Napier or other officers on the frontier States. Well these are confidential reports to the Indian Government. It is unusual, and I think it would be unwise to produce papers of this kind, and I therefore hope my hon! friend will not be offended or suppose that we consider the subject which he has brought under our consideration is not one of interest and importance, if I request him not to press his motion for documents, the greater part of which have no existence, and which as respects those we have could not be laid on the table of the House without great indiscretion. I would not trouble the House to-night with the few remarks which I have made and which might have been made much better by my hon. friend, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had it not been for the speech which was made in the early part of the debate by the hon. gentleman, the Member for Kirkcaldy (Sir George Campbell), to whom on this subject I listened with attention, even when, as to-night, he made some statements which appear to me to be quite unfounded. The hon. gentleman seems to me to look upon the present motion as being in itself of no importance, and I am not sure that he would have condescended to take part in this discussion had it not been for the portentous declaration which he says has been made by myself. It appears from the hon. gentlemaiTs view of the case that I am a Russophobist, and that I took in the House the other day the opportunity of hurling a menace at Russia. Now, what I said the other day 1 will advert to in a moment; but I was not aware at the time that the remarks which I then made would be the subject of such contrary interpretations, for they have been described on the one hand as being extremely indiscreet, and prompted only by the exigency of the moment, while to-night I come down to the House of Commons, and hear a high authority on such matters refer to them as observations which, instead of being indiscreet, and prompted by the exigency of the moment, indicated a change hi our policy. Our future policy in the East was, according to the hon. gentleman, shadowed forth by the observations which I made on the occasion to which he referred. The hon. gentleman even alluded to certain proceedings which recently occurred at Khelat, as demonstrating the great change and revolution in our Indian policy to which he called the attention of the House. I can only assure the hon. gentleman that what has taken place at Khelat is, as I believe, a wise and proper step, and one for which Lord Northbrook is as perfectly responsible, as he is for any act of his administration; and if the hon. gentleman wishes to obtain proof of this vast and dangerous change in our Indian policy, which he has not merely intimated, but announced this evening, but of which there is no evidence, he must not trust to the incidents which have taken place recently at Khelat. I take so very different a view of the relations between Russia and England, especially with reference to India, from those which the hon. gentleman has imputed to me, that I must say I listened with considerable astonishment to his remarks. What I said the other nio&gt;ht was, generally speaking, quite in accordance with all my previous declarations on the subject. I believe, Mr. Speaker, it is by courtesy allowed to a Member of the House to quote from a speech he has made in the Session, and I therefore quote this sentence: “ ‘ I am not of that school who view the advances of Russia into Asia with those deep misgivings some do. I think that Asia is large enough for the destinies of both Russia and England/ “Now, it seems to me to be somewhat curious that a man should be called a Russophobist for making a declaration of that kind. I went on to say—what I before stated in this House— “ f Whatever may be my confidence in the destiny of England, I know that empires are only maintained by vigilance, by firmness, by courage, by understanding the temper of the times, and by watching those significant indications that may easily be observed/ “These may be considered indiscreet observations; they may be construed into a menace to Russia by the hon. gentleman, who has not been very long in the House, though we are all glad that he is amongst us; but I may be allowed to say that ever since I have had any control over public affairs—which has been for now nearly a quarter of a century—so far as regards Foreign Affairs, and as representing a large party, these are the opinions which I have invariably expressed. They are no secret to the Russian Government, which has heard them over and over again, not merely in Parliament, but in our offices and in our drawing-rooms, and the Russian Government have always put upon them an interpretation perfectly different from that which the hon. gentleman put upon them. The Russian Government has not looked upon them as a menace, but, on the contrary, has regarded the language used as taking a common sense view of the position of the two countries—that there was room enough in( 12 ) Asia for Eassia and ^and and « bud imderstandin^the'result^oV'frankness and firmness Eussia knows full well there is no re™on wW vve should view the natural development of her empire m Asia with jealousy soTon- as it if clearly ma«le aware by the Government of this country that we are resolved to maintain and strengtlien both materially and morally our, Indian f “ h “®‘ “ ere ‘l rlo that but also uphold our legitimate influence in the Last, itussia, so tai as 1 have had any influence in the conduct of our affairs, has been made perfectly aware of those views and not only that, but they have thought them consistent with a good understanding between the two countries. I believe, indeed, that at no time lias there been a better understanding between the Courts of St. James and St. Petersburgh than at the present moment; and there is this good understanding because our policy is a clear and a frank policy. The observations which I made the other night some wise men of Gotham described as singularly indiscreet, and a wiser man this evening says he regards them as a direct menace to liussia; hut those observations express the unanimous opinions of an united Cabinet, and those opinions have been some time ago conveyed in clear language by my noble friend, the Secietaiy or State, to the representative of Russia in this country, and I say without hesitation that it is only by that frank expression of our views that a good understanding between the two empires can be maintained. But there is another way in which our affairs may be conducted. There is another way of viewing everything winch is done by Russia in Asia. e may look upon it with silent suspicion ; and if a circumstance occurs which is disagreeable to us, there may be a o-ood deal of growling and grumbling without ever acting. The country may be suddenly surprised at finding that Russia has taken a course which it thinks dangerous and unprece dented, because there has been no frank explanation between the two empires as to the temper and mode in which their mutual relations are to be carried on. Now, far from looking forward with alarm to the development of the power of Russia in Central Asia, I see no reason why she should not conquer Tartary any more than why England should not have conquered India. I only wish that the people of Tartary may gain as much advantage by being conquered by Russia as the people of India from being conquered by this country. I must take this opportunity, therefore, of telling the hon. gentleman who made this elaborate attack on the Government because of the observations which fell from me the other day, once for all that he has totally misconceived my views, and, indeed, has I think done violence to them. There was nothing in my remarks on the occasion to which he referred which I had not said before. They are remarks which I believe accurately describe the feeling of the present Government towards Russia in relation to India, and which I believe are calculated to preserve the good and honest understanding that exists between the two countries. As to what the hon. gentleman said about the occasion when I made those remarks as being a trumpery occasion, I beg to inform him that is an observation which I think he had no right to make. I could quote from hooks written by the lion, gentleman himself passages which show that he is deeply impressed, with all his experience, with the importance of the title which Her Majesty should assume in India, and he must he aware, though it is convenient to talk of the absurdity of putting up against the Emperor of Russia, to withstand his invasion of India, the mere empty title of the Sovereign, that human nature is influenced, by associations which are connected with titles, especially in the East; and if ever there was a moment on which an apt occasion should be seized of announcing to all the races of India the deep interest which this country takes in that empire, it was that of which we availed ourselves; and that when we were speaking of Russia with that cordiality and candour which we have always addressed to Russia since we have been responsible for the conduct of affairs, we were equally resolved to maintain our Indian Empire.” IS 9. Criticisms excited by this debate. —This speech of Mr DtsraelTs attracted marked attention in Eussia, and the Goloss (Voix) of the llth-23rd March 18/6, a newspaper inspired by the Eussian Foreign Office commented on it in a lengthy leading article, of which the followin ' a precis :— than sevmTcohirnm ™P or ^ an ^ question an article which takes up no less of Kokand foretold ‘ V ^ &gt;e ' -■ -^ declares that the annexation by Russia of the Khanate fven more than nmlfT 'l? n 7 ^ Rawlins0I b has in England and in British India found both in London an 1 e ^ n pronounced a necessity.

The two countries were at that time separated from one another by immense steppes and by uncivilised tribes, such as the Kirghiz, the Tur komans, the Sarthians, and others. But in the course of three centuries the aspect of the continent has undergone a remarkable change. The steppes have been parcelled out into Russian districts (ouiesdy), administered by the Russian authorities. To speak only of Cen tral Asia, the Governor-General of Turkestan, General Kauffmann, has become the friend and the best adviser of his neighbours, the Khans of Khiva and Bokhara. England on her side has reduced to subjection numerous tribes, such as the Sikhs, the Mahrattas, and the Burmese, and has conquered the kingdoms of Bengal, of Delhi, of Sindh, so that in the present day the power of the Viceroy of India extends as far as Afghanistan. Thus the first Englishman who set foot in India determined the condition of the country as it now appears to the eye of the observer. Why should it be otherwise with the first Russian who trod the soil of Central Asia? Civilization is the necessary corollary of the appearance of an European. The action of Russia in Asia has been in no way premeditated. The nomads of the steppes brohe over her borders and carried off Russian prisoners for sale in the markets of Asia. It was absolutely necessary for us to protect ourselves against these barbarians. Hence the first strongholds, the fortified posts, the lines of military occupation, which were the beginning of the Russian advance. To unite the defensive line of Orenburg to that of Siberia, we had to take up positions on the Syr-Dana and the Chou. Bokhara, Khiva, and Kokand opposed us, and we were obliged to fight them. Since then these countries have made their peace with Russia, and of fate Kokand has even clamoured for annexation to the Empire. Thus the necessities of defence have forced on the action of Russia, just as they have formed the motive power in the progress of England. Russia has never exaggerated those necessities. She has carried out her defensive measures fairly, without ever pushing them to the point of provo cation. She has everywhere done her best to enforce respect for the religion of conquered populations as well as for their persons and property. And thus Russia has undertaken the civilization of these barbarous countries. “In 1850, the value of the products and merchandise imported into Russia from Asia amounted only’to 600,000 roubles. 1 The Russian exports did not exceed the same sum. In 1867 the Asiatic imports had already risen to 13 millions and the Russian exports to 17 millions. We have no data from which to calculate the present value of the trade, because the Russian customs lines on the Asiatic frontier \vere abolished in 1868. But it stands to reason that the rate of progression can only have increased. The famous geographer Hellwald says in his work on Central Asia: f Russia is accomplishing a providential mission in this region. She is the representative of civilization/ Lejean again, a French traveller, whose opinions are not over favorable to Russia, remarks that f the conquest of Turkestan is a simple measure of defence on the part of Russia. For Turkestan, it is the one means of salvation/ Even the Times has declared that f the conquests of Russia in Central Asia are a benefit to the whole world/ The Americans hold the same view. A work which has just appeared at New York Russia and England in Central Asms— proves this in every page. A. different opinion, however, obtains in Calcutta. There every success of the Russian arms is regarded as a menace to the Indian Empire, and, as such, is at once announced in London. It is thus that the Statesmen who are charged with the direction of England's foreign policy gain their information as to the policy of^ Russia in Central Asia. India, with her two hundred millions of inhabitants, cannot surely be envious of the development of Russian trade in Asia—a mere nothing in comparison with her own. The Indian Empire possesses an army of two hundred thousand men four hundred guns, twelve thousand kilometres of navigable canals, a numerous fleet, and. a budget which knows nothing of deficits. Russia has only 30,000 troops in the whole of Turkestan not a fragment of railwav, not a single vessel of war worthy of the name, for one could not surely dignify with the title the few wretched little steamers which ply on the Jaxartes and.the Oxus. “These data, says the Voix, might well inspire the Russians with fear of the English. Assuredly they cannot make the English fear the Russians. Hie former aie safe fiom attack behind the Hindoo Koosh—a mast formidable barrier which is afforded them by the range of the Himalayas. Some other cause must be sought to account for the fear of Russia which the Eno-lish manifest in regard to their Indian possessions. Until the appearance of the Russians in Central Asia the whole continent knew only one European power, and that power was Eng land. Asia has now made the acquaintance of a second power, whose forces are hourly on the increase This fact has, to some small extent, diminished the consideration in which England was held by the Mussulman world. It must be added that the character of the Russians appears to the Mussulmans less uncompromising than that of the English, and that wherever Russian bayonets have shown themselves, slavery has been abolished, taxes reduced, and life made easier. In all parts of Asia the name of the f White Tsar' is pronounced with gratitude. This is 'the true cause of the English alarm. It is a question of moral rivalry. Hence the removal of the Viceroy, Sir John Lawrence. He was not considered enough of a Russo- phobist Hence also the famous interview brought about by his successor Lord Mayo with Shere Ali Ameer of Afghanistan, when the British troops were ostentatiously displayed, and the Ameer remarked that he had seen more soldiers there than he had seen Russians m all D( ) Turkestan. After having thus tried to impress the Ameer by the display of her troops, Eng. land agreed to pay him £1^0,000 a year and all to counteract the moral prestige the Russians had gained by the capture of Samarcand, waich town the Mussulmans considered the pearl of the union. It follows, according to the Voix, from a general view of the state of things in Mussulman Asia, that every premium offered to Islam by this jealous and shabby rivalry is equally hurtful to England and Russia. The two nations ought not to look upon themselves as rivals in Central Asia. Their interests are the same as regaids Muhammadanism. W hat they have to do is to calm Mussulman enmity—not to inflame it still further; to disarm it, and not to make it a formidable hostile power. Otherwise the English are just as likely to lose India as the Russians to lose Central Asia. As regards the objects of commercial policy, the Times, which is well up in the subject, has itself declared that the- Russian conquest is use ful to the trade of England, because the emulation of Russian manufacturers is much less dangerous than anarchy, brigandage, rapine, and theft among the mercantile depots in Central Asia. “ We sincerely desire, concludes the Voix, that there may be friendship and confidence in Asia between Russia and England. From the day that the Envoys of Lord Lytton, the new Viceroy, are sent to General Kauffmann, and the Envoj^s of General Kauffmann visit Lord Lytton, from that day the Mussulman world will understand that there are no longer in Asia two hostile powers face to face, but two friendly powers—Russia and England—representing Europe and Christendom, that is to say, civilization and progress.'” [Secret, August 1876, Nos. 1-20.] 10. Russian Agents at Cabul, and correspondence be tween General Von KaufFmann and the Ameer— On the 16th September 1876 His Excellency the Viceroy telegraphed to the Secretary of State urgently advising Her Majesty’s Government to remonstrate against the repeated correspondence carried on by General Kauffmann with the Ameer * (1.)

We may add that, notwithstanding the arrival of this second Ao&gt;ent his precursor still lingers at Cabul; and that we have received from an unofficial source^inform- ation, which we are of course unable to verify, that secret nightly conferences are taking- place between him and the Ameer. i “ U P to 7 ,i b ? P r f ei ^ tirae t} ie Government of India has not deemed it necessary to request Her Majesty s Government to make a formal objection to these proceedino-s of the Russian Generals; but from the memorandum accompanying this despatch, &amp; it will be gathered that the correspondence has been regarded by the Government with some anxietv • and that on one occasion, m a despatch No. 32P., dated 1st May 1874, the attention of Her Majesty s Government was drawn to the tone of General Kolpakovsky^s letter. “We now desire to submit, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government that the time has arrived when it is expedient that the attention of the Russian Government should be seriously called to the fact of this correspondence, and that steps should be taken by Her Majesty’s Government to prevent a continuance of proceedings which we cannot but reo-ard as altogether inconsistent with the assurances given by Prince Gortschakoff to Lord Clarendon in 1869, and, since then, frequently renewed by the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, that Afghanistan is regarded as ' entirely beyond the sphere of Russian influence.’ “In venturing to suggest this course for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Govern ment, we would represent that the issue more or less involved in the continuance, or disconti nuance, of the correspondence between the Russian officers and the Ameer of Cabui is one not of merely local or Indian, but of Imperial, interest, affecting, as it does, the important question whether the influence ol: England is to be superseded and replaced by that of Russia at the Court of the Ameer. The assurances of non-interference in Afghanistan given, and reiterated by the Cabinet of St. Petersburg to the Government of Her Majesty, have been, from time to time, communicated, with every expression of confidence in their sincerity, by the Government of India to the Ameer of Cabul. As the communications with His Highness, now systemati cally carried on by the Russian military authorities in Central Asia, are plainly irreconcilable with the above-mentioned assurances, it is obvious that the Ameer can only attribute their increas ing frequency, and prolonged toleration, either to the acquiescence of the British Government, or to its inability to resent so open a disregard of those pledges, on which its reliance has been pub licly and repeatedly recorded. In either case, the result cannot fail to be destructive of all confi dence and security in our relations with Afghanistan. The action open to the Government of India for the control of those relations is necessarily limited to the exercise of pressure upon 'the Ameer of Cabul; but we shall, on our part, lose no opportunity of co-operating with such steps as Her Majesty’s Government may be pleased to take in this matter, by our endeavours to convince the Ameer of the imprudence, as well as the impropriety, of the present correspond ence between His Highness and the Russian Generals.” In October the Secretary of State telegraphed that Prince Gortschakoff * Dementez categoriquement General Kaufmann had directed Count Schouv^aloff to deny a git a Caboui soit par un agent, on soit d’une autre categorically that General Von Kauffmann acted at Cabul either by Agent, or in any t ms Excellency’s telegram, dated 20 th October other manner.* The Viceroy replied'f that two Russian Agents had been at Cabul within the last month, and were believed to be there still. On the 28th September^ another despatch was sent to the Secretary of X To Secretary of state, No. 45, dated 28 th Sep- State enclosing the Cabul Diary from the tember 1876 - . 29th to the 31st August, and translations (1) of General Yon Kauffmann’s letter dated 6th July 1876, sent by the second Russian Agent, Mahomed Yusuf Khan; and (2) of the Ameer’s reply dated 27th August 1876, taken by Abdul Karim Khan, the first Agent, to the Gene ral’s letter of February regarding Kokand affairs. The General’s letter dated 6th July notified his return to Tashkend from St. Petersburg, and expressed § Cabui Diary, 7th to 9th November 1876. hopes for the continuance of the friendship between Russia and Cabul. Subsequently § the British Agent at Cabul reported that Mulla Saifulla, bearing a third letter from General Yon Kauffmann, had arrived at Mazar-i-Sharif, and that arrangements were being made for his journey to Cabul. A Cabul Diary dated 1st to 4th December 1876 contained a translation of the letter( 16 ) „ ^ and also of the Ameer’s reply sent by brought by Mulla Saif nlla to i j ^ General Von KaufFmann’s the second Agent, Mahomed tone of which was extremely letter dated 6th July.

Loftus and Prince Gorts- chakoff?nd Lord A Lottus and M. de Giers regarding this cnaKon aim xju , f proiected Russian expedition against°Merv.— Meantime a despatolf (No. 63 dated 21st December 1876) wffreceived from the India Office, which showed that the Government of Ind.a despatch, dated 28th September, had been sent to the English loieign Office, and that Lord Salisbury had assented to the text of General Kauffmann s let er of February 1876 being communicated to the Russian Go\ eminent. Also that Lord A. Loftus had had interviews with Prince Gortschakon and M. de Giers, respectively on the 15th and 17th November, of which he gave the following reports:— Interview with Pkince Goktschakoef as reported in Lord Loftus’ No. 536, dated 15th November 1876. « At my interview to-day with Prince Gortschakoff I profited of the opportunity to men tion the report of a projected Russian expedition to Mery. “ His Highness denied at once that any such intention existed, and authorized me to in form Your Lordship that there was no question of an expedition against Merv, nor any idea of oceunvinp' Merv. “Prince Gortschakoff said that some of the Tekke Turkomans had plundered some 'aids' of another Turkoman tribe under Russian protectorate, and that a detachment of troops had been sent to their protection, as also to keep open the communication between Krasnovodsk and Khiva. “His Highness denied t that there were indications of the Afghans undertaking an expedition against the Tekke Turkomans and Merv, but His t {Sic) but? observed. Highness did not appear to be acquainted with any details on the subject. “ I further mentioned to His Highness the communications which General Kauffmann was carrying on directly with the Ameer of Afghanistan through a secret Agent who had arrived some time ago at Cabul, and was still residing there, and I observed to him that these com munications were not in conformity with the engagement taken by Russia as recorded by His Highness himself, when he declared that Russia considered Afghanistan to be beyond the sphere of her political action. “ Prince Gortschakoff replied that there was no Russian Agent at Cabul as far as he knew, and that General Kauffmann had merely forwarded a complimentary letter to the Ameer, as he was in the habit of doing on returning to his post. But, added His Highness, ' quand nous avons en main une baleine je ne puis pas m’occuper des petits poissons/ His Highness however charged me to inform Your Lordship that the reported expedition against Merv was without any foundation'. Befoie level ting to the subject of General Kauffmann's communications with the Ameer ot Afghanistan, and the presence of a Russian Agent at Cabul, I shall request M. de Cners to give me an answer in writing to the note which I addressed to His Excellency on that subject on the mb October, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 483 of the 13th October. &lt; J 1 Interview with M. de Giers as reported in Lord A. Loftus’ No. 543, dated 17th November 1876. “ I had an interview to-day with M. de Giers, who is the Director of the Asiatic Depart ment ot the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs. ^ “I requested His Excellency to give me a written reply to my note in regard to th communication of General Kauffmann with the Amppr af r ^ ^ t ip , presence at Cabul of a Russian Agent Afghanistan, and the prolong* request for promised meTaVlttuld’^e' ) mpeioi had specially charged me if there shoutE be any question of difficulty in regard to Central Asia, to refer to him directly. Consequently if I found that the Imperial authorities at a distance from the central authority were acting on their own responsibility in opposition to the engagements entered into between the two Govern ments, I should immediately ask for an audience of the Emperor, in obedience to his orders, and submit the question to His Majesty. “ M. de Giers then stated that there was no question of General Kauffmann’s entering into political communication with the Ameer of Afghanistan, nor was there the remotest idea of any treaty engagements. The Agent was simply charged to deliver a letter of courtesy from General Kauffmann to the Ameer, which was an usual custom on his resuming the duties of his post, and as the Govern or-General of a neighbouring State. “ To this I replied that he was not the Governor of a neighbouring State, inasmuch as the Khanate of Bokhara was still to be regarded as an independent State, and that I therefore considered it necessary that General Kauffmann should receive express orders from the Imperial Government to desist in future from sending Agents to Cabul, and from entertaining political communication with the Ameer of Afghanistan. u M. de Giers then informed me that the Imperial Government had received information, both from General Kauffmann and through the Imperial Minister at Teheran, that the Afghan Government were making great military preparations. He stated that 10,000 men were assembled at Herat^with 1,600 cavalry, all well armed and equipped; that they were being constantly drilled and exercised; and that a cannon foundry was established at Herat, capable of producing one cannon per day. Prom the information the Imperial Government had received this armament was destined for the Turkomans and against Merv. “ It would appear from the report of General Kauffmann that he was somewhat disturbed in mind by this reported expedition. “ General Kauffmann in his report referred also to certain incursions beyond their frontier which the Afghan troops were undertaking in the direction of Zarafshan and Karategin, and he referred them as likely to produce a disturbance of the relations between Bokhara and Afghanistan. “ On my enquiry His Excellency further informed me that in consequence of a disagree ment between the Turkomans and the Khan of Khiva, the latter had expressed a wish to renounce his rights of Government in favor of Bussia, but that General Kauffmann had opposed this wish, and was now acting as the arbitrator between the Khan and his subjects. “ His Excellency stated that the Imperial Government desired anxiously that no change in the status quo should take place, and that peace and order should reign in Central Asia.'” 12. Other subjects discussed at these interviews. Russian expedition against Merv. Afghan Military preparations.— It will have been observed that besides the alleged correspondence and political nego tiations between the Ameer of Cabul and the Russian authorities at Tashkend, three other matters were referred to at these interviews. These were a Russian expedition against Merv, and the military preparations of the Afghans in the direction of Herat and of Zarafshan and Karategin. As regards the projected Russian expedition to Merv the following extract from the Cabul Diary ending 13th November 1876 gave the latest inform ation available at the time :— “ It is reported that the Governor of Turkestan has written (to the Ameer) on the authority of a rumour, that the Russians are collecting supplies in Charjoi with a view to making an attack on Merve Shahjehan, that a guard of 3,000 troops has been summoned from Samarcand to Charjoi, that they (the Russians) intimated their wish to the Mir of Kirki to visit his territory, to ascertain the depth of the Oxus, but the Mir expressed regret that his people would be opposed to their coming, and that consequently they have abandoned their intention of visiting Kirki. This report requires confirmation; enquiries will be made and result communicated.^ In respect to the Afghan preparations at Herat, the Persian Government * Mr. T. Thomson’s telegram, dated 20th October had also expressed SOme UneasinGSS.^ But 1876 - the British Minister at Teheran was in formed that the Ameer of Cahul had long been engaged in putting his military resources in order and strengthening Herat. In the opinion of the Government of India there was not any ground for apprehending aggressive tHis Excellency the viceroy’s telegram, No. 25 ooa.p„ designs against Persia, f Notwithstanding dated 23rd October 1876. this expression of opinion the Prince Governor of Khorassan deputed Mahomed Bakir Khan to Herat nominally to( 20 ) 14 Opinion of the Secretary of State for India as to the answers which should be sent to the Russian Govern ment.- The India Office advised* dfalt'S ^“4^ ° fflCe ' Russian Agents had been sent to Cabul with the object of negotiating a Treaty with the Ameer was denied both by the R ussl an Government and General Kauffmann, and it was asserted that the Generals communications had been merely letters of courtesy sent through the Ameer nf The assurance o'iven on the first point was satisfactory, hut the general view of the correspondence taken by the Russian Government could not be accepted as correct without referring^ to earlier communications. General KauffmamTs letter of February last, which contained a detailed account of the Russian conquest of Kokand with justificatory remarks of a suggestive character could not be regarded as a mere letter of couitesy, and as to the allegation that the hearers of the different letters had not been Russian Agents, hut messengers employed by the Ameer of Bokhara, it was enough to observe that they had been viewed at Cabul in the former light, and treated accordingly. The fact'that the character, both of the letters and of their hearers, was open to such misconstruction constituted a sufficient reason for the issue by the Rus sian Government to General Kauffmann of orders to altogether discontinue his communications to the Ameer. Lord Salisbury then referred to the alleged British expedition against Swat, which is a valley in the immediate vicinity of Peshawur on the southern side of the Hindu Kush, inhabited by tribes whom the Indian Government had often been compelled to punish, but with whom at present it was not on had terms. Rut even assuming such a movement to he contemplated His Lord- ship was at a loss to understand how it could be regarded as a breach of the agreement of 1872 between the Russian and British Governments, which had reference solely to the relations of the former Government with Afghanistan, and the general obligation which the British Government accepted to use its influence with the Ameer to deter him from aggressive movements beyond his recognized borders. The influence of the Government of India had been con sistently exercised to that end. There was no reason to believe, either that the Ameer contemplated aggression on Darwaz, or that the preparations which had been for some time past in progress at Herat, were in any way directed against the Turkomans of Merv, hut enquiries would be made from the Government of India. A subsequent despatch showed that Lord A. Loftus had been instructed to address M. de Giers in writing in the sense of Lord Salisbury’s remarks. But whereas Lord Derby wrote— The fact that the character both of the letters and of their bearers is open to such miscon struction, is a sufficient reason for the issue by the Russian Government to General Kauffmann of orders to altogether discontinue his communications to the Ameer.” Lord A. Loftus wrote to M. de Giers (dated 22nd February 1877.)— : ^fcellency will no doubt agree in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government that the fact that the character both of the letters and their bearers is open to such misconstruction, a sufficient reason for the discontinuance of such communications to the Ameer, and that with “iseZ °J, reVent any SUch miscon ^ruction General Kauffmann should be instructed to avoid giving differ?n7f™ S ^’ &amp; avo ^ giving rise to misconstruction” is very COrreS P 0nd ^ more with the Ameer, which is bearer of 7 ^ de Gi f rs that Mulla Saifulla was t bearer of a letter from General Kaufmann but denial thatwas personally known to or employed by the latter.— On the 15th March the Secretary of State addressed a further despatch to the Govern ment of India (No. 21, dated 15th March 1877). Its enclosures showed that Lord A. Loftus had taken an early opportunity to speak to M. de Giers on the subject of the continued presence of a Russian Envoy at Cabnl, of his receiving presents from the Ameer, and of the announcement of the expected arrival of the bearer of a further letter from General Kauffmann. He had fur- » See Diaries, dated 7th to 9th November 1876, nislled ffis Excellency with a.COpy of tile sent home with despatch No. 59, dated 8th Decern- extracts frOUl the Cabul Diaries* relating l)er 18 ' 6, to this subject, as an aide-memoire^ and enquiry into the matter had been promised. On the 13th Eebruary M. Giers called on the British Ambassador, and admitted that the namef given in the Cabul Diaries of the reputed Russian Agent was the same as that mentioned by General Kaulfmann. He was not however personally employed by General Kauffmann, nor personally known to him. The letter of which he was the bearer had been sent by General Kauff mann to the Emir of Bokhara for transmission to Balkh, whence it was forwarded to the Ameer at Cabul. f Viz.&gt; Mullah Saifullah. The Agent in question was the mere hearer of a letter, was neither selected X Muikh Saifullah is said to be General Kauff- nor personally knownj to, General mann’s Peshkhidmat, see Diaries, 7th to 9th Novem- Kauffmann, and consequently was in no ber 18/6 ' way authorized to assume the character of a Russian Agent or Envoy at Cahul. General Kauffmann had been informed that the assumed character at Cahul of a Russian Envoy was incorrect, liable to misconception, and consequently to be guarded against for the future. The English Foreign Office was disposed to express satisfaction with this instruction issued to the General. But Lord Salisbury thought differently; he advised— “ the instruction in question, although to a certain extent satisfactory, is so vague in its terms that, unless such a course would be opposed t o diplomatic usage, it would be better to reserve any remark in reference to it on the part of Her Majesty’s Government until the result is seen of the written communication which, by Lord Derby’s despatch No. 28, dated the 7th February, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg was directed to make to the Russian Government. “ From that communication, Prince Gortschakoff will have learned that, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, what is essential, in order to obviate misconstruction, is the issue of orders to General Kauffmann to altogether discontinue his correspondence with Cabul. cc The instruction which has been sent appears merely to enjoin precautions against the assumption of an unauthorized character by the persons who may be employed as bearers of letters to the Ameer from the Russian authorities in Turkestan. Unless therefore it be supple mented, the object which Her Majesty’s Government have had in view in calling attention to the matter will not have been attained, and under these circumstances the use of language which might seem to imply that the present action of the Russian Government is regarded as sufficient, appears to Lord Salisbury to be of doubtful expediency.'” The result of Lord Derby’s despatch, dated 7 th February, which Lord Salisbury desired to await, is shown in the succeeding paragraph. 16. Reply of the Russian Government to Lord A. Loftus, note, dated If February.—'Lord Salisbury’s despatch No. 32, dated 12th April 1877, furnished the Government of India with M. de Giers’ reply, d ate d -sthMarc?^ which was as follows :— “ J’ai 1’honneur de recevoir la note que V. E. § See paragraph 14, Sapra. a j^ en vou } u m’adresser en date du 10-22 Fevrier.§ “ Le Ministere Imperial partage entierement 1’avis du Gouvernement Britannique qu’un echano-e d’ opinions franc et cordial dans les questions de 1’Asie Centrale ne saurait que contri- buer au maintien des bonnes et amicales relations actuellement etablies entre la Russie et 1’Angleterre.into Darwaz, so long as their operations are confined to the Cis-Oxus portion of the territory, would not appear to constitute an infringement of the understanding between the British and Bussian Governments.^ On the 5th July 1877 (despatch No. 50) the Secretary of State replied to the Goyernment of India despatch just cited. The enclosures showed that Lord Derby had instructed the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg— “ to inform the Russian Government that enquiry has been made in India, and that nothing has been heard of any Afghan movement against Darwaz either by the Indian Govern ment or by Mirakhor Ahmad Khan, a high official of the Cabul Government, who had been lately at Peshawur. A reference has been made to the Ameer of Afghanistan on the subject, the result of which would be communicated in due course.” In alluding to the reference said to have been made to the Ameer of Cabul Lord Derby went beyond Lord Salisbury’s instructions. Lord Salisbury bad said— « Lord Derbv will observe that the Government of India have heard of no such movement, and that the Mirakhor Ahmad Khan, a high official of the Cabul Government, lately at Peshawur, had likewise heard of none. “ Should Lord Derby consider it necessary that any communication should be made to the Russian Government on the subject, Lord Salisbury would suggest that it be limited to a declaration in the above sense. In His Lordship's opinion it is inexpedient at present to raise the question adverted to in the final paragraph of the Government of India letter, or to provoke a discussion as to the limits respectively of Darwaz and Badakshan, and as to how far Afghan sovereignty over any portion of the latter principality lying on the south bank of the Oxus was recognized by the understanding arrived at between the Russian and British Govern ments in 1872.” In the concluding paragraph there is an obvious mistake which is repeated in the covering despatch to the Government of India. There is no question about the boundaries of Badakshan; which province lies wholly on the south bank of the Oxus and was recognized by Prince Gortschakoff in his despatch to Count Brunnow, dated ^ January 1873 as being included within the dominions of the Ameer Shere Ali. But a portion of Darwaz apparently lies on the south of the Oxus, the greater part of the province being situate on the north bank. And the question which Lord Salisbury deemed it inexpedient to raise was whether so much of Darwaz as lies on the south bank of the Oxus was acknowledged in 1872 as Afghan territory.

[Secret, September and December 1877, Nos. 84-88.] 18 The Russian Government have not been furnished by the British Ambassador at St. Petersburgh with copy of General Kauffmann’s Kokand letter to the Ameer, dated . From India Office to Foreign Office, dated 20th February 1876.-It has 136611 86611 November 1876 . that Lord Salisbury assented (see paia- graph 11 supra) to the text of General Kauffmann’s Kokand letter, dated February 1876, being communicated to the Bussian Government. But as far as appears from the correspondence forwarded to the Government of India the text of this letter has never been placed by Lord A. b'ottus before M. de Giers or any other member of the Bussian Government. Lord Dei by on the 24th October expressed his intention of communicating this letter to Count Schouvaloff, the Bussian Ambassador at St. James. And on the 28th November 1876 Lord A. Loftus reported to Lord Derby that he had furnished the Bussian Government— “ with the text of the correspondence between the Ameer of Cabul and General Kauffmann as printed in the Cabul Diary, of which I received a copy m Your Lordship s despatch No. 580, dated 15th instant.” But a comparison of dates will show that the corresponuence here referred to was not the Kokand letter but the Ameer’s reply to it and General Kauffmann s second letter, dated 6th July. Again, in his letter, dated 22nd lebruary 1877,( 24 ) to M. de Giers, Lord A. Loftus refers to the Kokand letter, but it does not appear either that he had ever seen the leiter himself 01 . that he had sent a copy to M. de Giers. The point is worth bearing in mind when considering the results of Lord A. Loftus’ correspondence and intei views with jVL de Giers and the indignant rejoinders of General Kauffmann. M. de Giers in his note, dated ZSlemS 1876 and General Kauffmann in his memorandum, dated 9th November 1876 are replying to the allegations in Lord A. Loftus’ note, dated Somber ber 1876, which enclosed the text of no correspondence. It gave prominence to the alleged Treaty negotiations the existence of which had not been reported by the Government of India and which Lord Derby is supposed to have referred to on the authority of a telegram from the Times' Calcutta correspondent. General Kauffmann’s explanations were, therefore, directed to an assertion neither advanced by the Government of India nor supported by any positive evidence. It is no wonder that his explanation is triumphant and apparently places the British Government conclusively in the wrong. And the unimportant correspondence between the General and the Ameer which Lord A. Loftus subsequently sent to M. de Giers is cleverly utilized by the latter to emphasize his statement that General Kauffmann’s communi cations were of a purely formal character. It is because he has never been confronted with the Kokand letter that M. de Giers is still able to assert in his note, dated 1877, that General Kauffmann’s letters to the Ameer are letters of courtesy and nothing more.

THE TURKOMANS OP THE ATTREK, AKHAL, AND MERV AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, PERSIA, AFGHANISTAN AND ENGLAND. See Chapters III and IV of Mr. Henvefs precis. 19. Reported submission of a portion of the Akhal Turko mans to Russia. —About the middle of February 1875 Sofi Khan, a not very influential Chief* of the Akhal Turkomans, arrived at Krasnovodsk with a following * His name is not mentioned in Mr. R. Thomson’s memorandum in Appendix IV. of thirty horsemen. It was said that through his aid and owing to the conciliatory attitude assumed by General Lomakin, peaceful and seemingly sincere relations had been established with the Akhai Tekke hitherto hostile to Russia. At an interview with Sofi Khan, General Lomakin presented him with a written order from the Grand Duke Michael, Commanding in the Caucasus, and a gold medal attached to a riband of the Order of St. Stanislaus. These marks of distinction were awarded in acknowledgment of his assistance in establishing friendly relations between the Russians and the Tekke tribe, and of his zeal in obtaining the release of the Yemoots carried off by a band of Tekke marauders who sacked Dakhli in October 1874. On the 23rd February General Lomakin invited Sofi Khan and his com panions to a pleasure party by steamer in the Gulf of Krasnovodsk. The vessel and its fittings afforded them intense enjoyment, and the quantity of tea they absorbed on board was something incredible. [Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated t^rd April 1875, 0.N.] 20. Feelings of the Tekke Turkomans of Merv towards Russia. —According to a Mahomedan trader, who had just escaped from capti vity, Merv is full of prisoners (slaves) from Afghanistan and particularly from Persia. The Tekkes have no fear of the Russians, and laugh at the idea of a Russian detachment coming to punish them. They are all armed with sabres and guns, and possess some 30 pieces of artillery, which they do not know how to use, and for which they have no ammunition. The oasis of Murgab is very fertile and rich; corn is remarkably cheap; and of horned cattle and sheep they possess an abundance. But they are very badly off for horses, so much so, that one good horse can hardly be found for every 20 kibitkas. The Tekkes themselves estimate the total number of their tribe at 100,000 kibitkas, but in the opinion of the trader 40,000 is nearer the truth. Of ready-money there is not much in circulation, but upon the whole the Tekke tribe is rich enough, and the members show their wealth by wearing a variety of gold and silver ornaments. Another recently released captive, Kurban Ali, a Persian, gives the following account of Merv : « x wa s quite a child when the Tekkes carried me away to Merv. While yet a boy I became a servant to Madali Khan, and was subsequently taken into the household of Sultan Ibrahim. About a month ago I escaped to Charjui, whence I made my way into the Amu- Daryan district. The oasis of the Murghab is not extensive but exceedingly fertile; corn is abundant and very cheap. u Tekkes lead a very monotonous and quiet life, rarely leaving the oasis; I believe circumstances compel them to this inactive existence, which is very much against their inclina tions and habits. They estimate their own numbers at 40,000 kibitkas, though I think in reality the tribe is much smaller. Together with the Tekkes live the Saryks, numbering about 10 000 and the Salors, amounting to 500 kibitkas. These three tribes dwell in close alliance within'the oasis and are foes in common to the tribe of Ersarees, who occupy the banks of the Upper Murghab and are nominally subjects of the Emir of Bokhara. &lt;t There is no Elder in authority at Merv, and the Tekkes live in a chronic state of complete anarchy. G( 26 ) ' The Russians and Afghans are looked upon as enemies. As to the former, the Tekkes are always apprehensive of a Russian invasion; the latter are rather looked down upon, if not actually despised. “ With Bokhara and Persia the Tekkes live in peace, and with both countries they carry on a brisk trade. From Meshed to Bokhara and vice versa caravans are continually passing through Merv It is specially on account of the Ersarees that the Tekkes avoid disputes with Bokhara; and as regards Persia, that country has of late shown a bolder front towards the Turkomans, which probably deters the Tekkes from undertaking raids into Persian territory. Thus for instance half a year ago the garrison at Meshed was considerably reinforced, whilst at the same time a Persian detachment of 4,000 men was posted at Sarraks. [Turkestan Gazette, No. 29, dated IKnd July 1875.] [Turkestan Gazette, No. 34, dated lUh August 1875.] 21. Russian feeling towards the Tekkes of Merv.— The fol- lowing translation by Mr. R. Michell (Abstract No. XI, dated 12th August 1875) illustrates the feeling of the Russian Press as to the necessity for the ultimate subjugation of Merv :— The chief difficulty experienced by the Government of the Khan (Khiva) is that which is occasioned by the Turkomans living within the Khanate, and still more by the Turkomans of the steppes, but principally those of Merv, the nest of these robbers. The Khivan Turko mans are now quieted, but the agitations in the steppes are little diminished, owing to the plundering of the Tekkes whose centre is Merv. From this latter place agitation spreads to the Khivan and Persian frontiers, and to our Trans-Caspian and Oxus regions. Our garrison at Petro-Alexandrofsk is obliged constantly to send out detachments to secure the left bank of the Oxus from the depredations of the Tekke Turkomans. The Invalide says :— f The turbulent Turkoman Tekke tribe are not amenable to our influence, protected by surrounding deserts, proud in their independence, and considering themselves unconquerable,—seeing that all the former attempts made by Persia, Khiva, and Bokhara to subdue them were unavailing,—the Tekkes have assumed a defiant attitude towards Russia. Our calls upon them to discontinue jheir depiedations, and our demands for the release of the artillery soldier whom they captured in the year 1873, remain unattended to; the traffic between Khiva and Bokhara is in constant danger of interruption, and is completely controlled by the Tekkes. The Khiva campaign has given security to trade with Kazalinsk and Orenburg; but the Oxus oasis is isolated from all commercial relations with Bokhara and with the countries along the coast of the Caspian, since the intermediate territories are domineered over exclusively by the numerous 1 CRR0S. i l* 10 E ',f' lsh ''‘T'’ as , om readers are already aware, understand equally well that the 'rt 7 t, ' &gt; J tran '| ullhl -y iu the Turkoman steppes, as in all Central Asia, is to be found at Merv. the English now recognize the necessity ot curbing the Tekke Turkomans, a necessity which Merv^thaftl-ui our othcers durmg the Khiva campaign.

Nevertheless, influenced by the presents they bad received the Turkoman Chiefs generally were showing a friendly dis position towards the Russians. Mr. Thomson observed that the construction ^ a -D° r ^ was L entirel y opposed to the spirit of the arrangement between Russia and. Reisia.. Further reports showed that General Lomakin was actively engaged m establishing and extending Russian influence among the Yemoot and Akhal iurkomans by working on their cupidity. There was also some question of changing the site of the proposed fort. Byat-i-Haji had been disapproved, and the advisability of cutting off a portion of the water of the Lower Attrek at bumbar, and conducting it to the site of the old fort and town of Meshed-i- lesnan was under consideration. The proposal would greatly iniure the pastures of the Yemoots on the Lower Attrek. It would also be a fresh inva- ^ l of il the / 1 p hts 0 f Persia &gt; f or the extreme limit of the Russian pretensions had hitherto been that the waters of the Attrek are the joint property of the two States. J &lt; But in November 1875 Mr. Thomson reported that Byat-i-Haii had cer tainly not been abandoned. {Secret, January 1876, Uos. 79-100.] Baron J omim s remarks on this rumour— This report from Teheran that General Lomakin had passed Kizil Arvat on his way to attack the Tekkes of Akhal and Merv was discussed at St. Petersburg. And in a letter dated 3rd August 1875, Mr. Doria, Charge d’Affaires at St. Petersburg, observed that Baron Jomini’s remarks on the subject led him to believe that there was no foundation whatever for the report. Baron Jomini said— fhci-e w a s no eau se f° r or ^vuntag 6 to be gained by, such an expedition. If there was, then, although they would be sorry to be disagreeable to England, ' every one for himself, and God for all, but if they took Merv, they would find themselves, on account of the maraud ing tribes, necessitated to make a further advance in order to curb and restrain them, and where was it to end ?” &gt; ff® then referred to the Czar’s orders against any attack on Merv, and added that the increased submissiveness which the Turkoman tribes had recently manifested towaids General Lomakin rendered an attack onlMerv less necessary. {Secret, October 1875, No. 12.] Further details of General Lomakin’s reconnaissance in the Attrek country. —It appears that, General Lomakin having received the pievious approval of the Grand Luke Michael, left Rrasnovodsk some time in July with a battalion of Shirvan infantry, a troop of cavalry, a division of artillery, and a rocket company. He then marched to Chikisliar by way of Lakes Shairdy and Bugdaili, past the ruins of Memael and Mestodooran, along the old bed of the Attrek through the summer camping grounds of the Jafiiv bais and Atabais. At Chikisliar the detachment was reinforced by troops from * Sic in orig. Baku and transported thence to Kadji Myktum* by barges of the Caspian flotilla. After a considerable stay at Chikisliar the detachment advanced to Byat-i-Haji and thence to Chat, as the locality is called, where the Sumbar joins the main stream of the Attrek. The troops explored the right bank of the Sumbar for six versts and then returned to Krasnovodsk by the route they had come, having been absent some four months. For further details see Appendix VII. {Secret, August 1875, No. 21.] {Turkestan Gazette, No. 28, dated lUh February = 1th March 187.6,]( 28 ) 25. Withdrawal of ^Pf^rada^-On^sth Condition of the bv t i ia t all the Russian troops at Chikisliar, Thomson telegraplied ° °r w i t j ic i rawn to Krasnovodsk, that the Mand of AshSX had suffered further damage by inundation, and that its protection by embankment was estimated to cost half a rmlhon roubles. By itself the withdrawal of the troops did not appear to be of pohtica significance. But when viewed in connection with the inundation of Ashurada it might indicate that the Russians had been induced to modify their* plan of advance from the Caspian eastward to Merv. Between Krasno- vodsk and the Bay of Astrabad there are only open roadsteads and so long as the Island of Ashurada is tenable, there can be ittle doubt that it will never be abandoned as the chief military depot m the south-eastern corner of the Caspian. But the attitude of resistance recently assumed by Persia to the establishment of a Russian station on the Peninsula of Mian Kali, under any name or pretext, shows that the ultimate submergence of Ashurada, which is now looked upon as not improbable, would be hailed with satisfaction by the Persian Government, and that nothing shoit of military pressure would induce the latter to concede Khoja Nafas or any other point on the mainland in the Bay of Asterabad in substitution for the station at Ashurada. It might be, therefore, that the withdrawal of the troops indicated an inten tion to make Krasnovodsk the base of an advance upon Merv by way of the Great and Little Balkan and the line of the Attrek, leaving for future opportunity the occupation of the Attrek and Gurgan Valleys. [Secret, March 1876, No. 124.] [Secret, May 1876, No. 1.] 26. Further correspondence between the Persian and Rus* sian Governments regarding the frontier line of the Attrek.— For an explanation of the position of this question I must refer to paragraphs 74 to 82 and 86 to 90 of Mr. Henvey’s precis and to Mr. Hertslet’s note in Appendix III. It is sufficient to note here that in April 1875 Mr. Taylour Thomson forwarded further correspondence on the subject which had passed between the Persian Government and the Russian Minister at Teheran. The former in a letter dated the 26th December 1874, after expressing a hope that the Russian Government had given instructions which would pre vent in future any action likely to cause complaint, wrote as follows regarding the inseparability from Persia of the river Attrek and the allegiance of the tribes inhabiting its vicinity :— “ I most respectfully remind Your Excellency that the arrangement of 1869 was sudden and telegraphic, the heads of matters were stated, but details were not entered into. It does not follow that because all the old established rights of Persia were not inserted therein, they should be made a subject for doubt and refutation. The fact that tribes move from place to place, which is an old usage and the mode of living of nomad people, does not deprive them of their allegiance to their lawful State; the Shahseven tribes of Persia, for instance, spend half the year in Russian territory, and Persian and Turkish tribes accommodate themselves to their summer or winter quarters by crossing over to the territories of both States, their respective nationalities remaining, as before, unaltered. The doubt which has been suggested to Your Excellency as to whether the tribes in question pay tribute to any one is unfounded; they have always been payers of tribute to Persia, and the amount due by them is registered and yearly collected by the Asterabad authorities. If, owing to their wild habits and want of education, they occasionally showed a rebellious spirit and refused to pay their tribute, they were soon compe e o o so by the Crovernment of Asterabad. Therefore, as regards their allegiance to Persia, there cannot be, for us, the slightest doubt.” - ■^ rc l 1 1875 the Russian Minister replied that the proceedings of General Lomakin were not important enough to justify the repeated com plaints of the Persian Government. And although the arrangement of 1869 was ma e y e egiaph, it was nevertheless fully discussed, and both Govern ments considered it perfectly clear and sufficient He declined to enter into the question why the Turkomans and others were not inserted in the arrangement.To this the Persian Minister answered that the complaints of his Govern ment arose from the disregard by the Eussian authorities of the arrangement of 1869, the terms of which were asserted to be so clear and sufficient. General Lomakin’s circular* to the Turkoman Chiefs was an instance in point. Prom * Enclosed in Mr. r Thomson’s No. io of 29 th the first, the object to which the Persian January 1873. See para. 108, Mr. Henvey’s precis. Government attached chief importance was the maintenance of the Shah’s ancient sovereign rights over the Turkoman tribes which had indeed been described by the Eussian Minister himself in his letter dated 13th December 1869. Any interference with these tribes by the Eussian Government would he regarded by Persia as an infringement of her established and sacred rights. On the 1st May the Eussian Minister answered that the object of his letter dated 13th December 1869 had merely been to inform the Persian Government that the Emperor had assented to the recognition by Eussia of the sovereignty of Persia up to the river Attrek, which recognition had been repeated in his letter dated 11th December 1871. At this point the correspondence ended. Writing upon this subject the Eussian Golos remarked that “ owing to the treaty of 1869, in which the Attrek, discharging its waters into the bay of Hassan-Kuli, w r as adopted as the boundary line between Eussia and Persia, Eussia can do nothing against the robberies of the Turkomans committed south of that river, which Persia herself is too weak to check.” The article proceeded:—- “ It can safely be asserted that if the rivulet Karasu, falling into the south-eastern corner of the bay of Asterabad, were to form the boundary between Russia and Persia so that all Turkoman tribes would appertain to Russia, their raids would soon cease, now that Khiva has been subdued and the entire Trans-Caspian steppe region is restored to peace. At present, however, even our Russian Turkoman subjects (for example, the Yomuds and others) break the law with impunity, inasmuch as they can evade justice by crossing over to the south side of the Attrek, thus placing themselves on Persian territory where neither Russia (owing to the treaty), nor Persia (in consequence of her weakness) can punish them, while the Tekkes continue to pillage Persian settlements, and still enslave Persians for their heavy domestic labors.” [Secret, September 1875, Nos. 33-41.] [Turkestan Gazette, No. 52, dated \1 th—^th August 1876.] 27. Russian prisoners in the hands of the Merv Turko mans. —Towards the close of 1875 Mr. Doria reported that he had mentioned to Baron Jomini the counsel given by the Viceroy of India to the Ameer of Afghanistan suggesting that the Tekke tribe should be advised to release the Eussian prisoner said to be in their hands. Baron Jomini evinced a lively satisfaction at the communication, and asked for a copy of Lord Derby's despatch for the Emperor, who had left St. Peters burg for the Crimea, and w r ho would be gratified at the friendly act. He remarked upon the word prisoner being in the singular, stating there were several prisoners. Mr. Doria replied it was perhaps by inadvertence that an ‘s’ had been omitted. A few days afterwards Baron Jomini adverting to the above communica tion read to Mr. Doria a paragraph from a despatch from Krasnovodsk, dated 24th July 1875, in which it was stated that the Ameer of Afghanistan was said to be intriguing and exciting ill-feeling among the Turkoman tribes near Merv. Mr. Doria, in reply, promised to bring the circumstances to the notice of his Government. [Secret, January 1876, Nos. 49-53.] 28. Reported Overtures to Cabul on the part of the Saryk Turkomans. —A letter written by the British Agent at Meshed and dated 23rd May 1876 mentioned that the Chiefs of the Saryk Turkomans had visited Herat and called upon the authorities there to appoint a Governor for their tribek The matter had been referred to the Ameer of Cabul.

Irrvmcincs nf TVTprv—The Tuvkestctn Gazette^ dated. 30th ivlay lo76j puhhshed the following” information regarding the Mery Turkomans:- “ As regards the Turkomans of Mew, the rumours concerning- their relations with the Ameer of Afghanistan would appear to be confirmed. It is asserted that S lere All Khan is constantly sending emissaries to them, and that he has ordered Herat merchants to send to Merv supplies of corn and other necessaries, which at Mew have risen very considerably in price. « According to information from another quarter, the Turkomans of Merv are making ready for an incursion on a large scale into Khorassan; it is also said that the Persians are adopting energetic measures of defence, and that the Governor ot Shah-Rood has received orders to be in readiness, and to take the necessary steps for securing the Khorassan road, finally, a nomad tribe which was at one time settled in Khorassan, and which duiing one ot the wars between Persia and Khiva passed over to the latter Khanate* has applied to the Government of the Shah for permission to return to its former settlement in the Djash distiict, undeitaking to furnish the Persian army with a detachment of 2.50 horsemen. With regard to these remarks the only information on the subject possessed at the time by the Government of India is given below. It will be seen that Shere Ali entertained a confident opinion that the Russian Government would shortly annex Merv and turn out the Turkomans unless they gave in. The latter would then take refuge in the country round Herat, and probably the Russians would insist on his responsibility for the good behaviour of the tribe. It was better that he should anticipate matters, take the Turkomans into his service, distribute them over the different provinces of Afghanistan and assign them land and allowances :—- “Extract from Cabul Diary from 21st to 24th July 1876, inclusive. “The Mustaufi and the Herat Chiefs represented to the Ameer that in the Turkoman terri tory there are two noted Chiefs, Khurshid Khan of Merv-i-Shahjehan and Nur Yerdy Khan of Akhal; that Nur Verdy Khan has one house (meaning family) in Akhal and one in Merv, with a view to maintaining more influence amongst his people, and that he lately wrote to Khurshid Khan as follows : ‘ It is reported that the Russians intend to attack us next winter. We will therefore collect first in Akhal and send our families and children to you in Merv. Should we he unsuccessful in opposing the Russians in Akhal, we will go to Merv, and in the event of the Russians forcing us to quit the Fort of Merv, we will kill our families and child ren with our swords, leave the fort, and continue to oppose the Russians vigorously so long as we live/ ” “ Extract from Cabul Diary from 25th to 27th July 1876, inclusive. On the authority of a letter received from the Deputy Governor of Herat, Mirakhor Ahmed Khan, the Mustaufi reported to the Ameer that the Turkomans had abandoned the sale of their horses for some time past, with a view to keep themselves in readiness to oppose (the Russians), but that now the brother of Khurshid Khan, Chief of Merv, has arrived at Herat ostensibly with 70 horses for sale, but really with a letter from some Turkoman elders expressing themselves allies of the Ameer. His Highness ordered the Mustaufi to write to the Mirakhor on his own part to show suitable honor to the brother of Khurshid Khan, to purchase some orses o supenoi need fiom him, to submit the letter to Cabul, and after granting him a suitable khillut and making verbal assurances send him back to Turkoman territory, telling Cabul 'f, a re P / 0 16 e kt ei would he sent to him to Merv as soon as it is received from “ Extract from Cabul Diary from 8th to 10th August 1876, inclusive. “ The Ameer observes on several occasions privately as follows : imnressioiTthat theWthf^R 8 have . take ^ Passion of Kharizm (Khiva), I have been under the and oth^Turkoman .^ u ? sians ) , wc ! uk ^ some time make an attack on Akhal, Merv-Shahjehan, luikoman. territories, and that owing to their miseonduet, the Turkomans will hardly 7,000 families^f them from ^en^^KhlvV'whpr^t} 1116 ^ 60 ^ ° n tke ' Tamshides of Herat, and camps near Kuna-Urgendj, and towards Mangvt and KmcbT e p ta 1 blls ( ied in , J he neighbourhood of Turk im that their condWin Khiva sZ a^etchet^r' ° f «be able to take refuge in any State other than (Afghanistan), and will undoubtedly take up their residence in Badgis (a dependency of Herat), a large plain abounding in water and pasturage for cattle, &amp;e., and at considerable distance from Balkh and Herat. Also that through fear lest the said Turkomans should commit raids within Russian dominions, the Russians would ask Afghanis tan either to guarantee the good behaviour of the Turkomans or allow them (the Russians) to punish the latter so suitably as to prevent future outrages by them. From what I hear of the state of affairs in Turkoman territory, I think that my abovementioned provision would prove correct shortly—probably this very year. 1 now feel great anxiety day and night lest, in the event of the Russians overcoming the Turkomans and the latter taking refuge in Badgis, and the Russians troubling Afghanistan to become security for the good behaviour of the Turko mans towards them, Afghanistan may hardly be able to become security for such a multitude, owing to their inveterate bad habits. Under these circumstances, it is desirable that having regard to the frontier of other States, the Afghan Government should in a diplomatic manner distribute the Turkomans in suitable groups of families to different provinces throughout Afghanistan, and assign allowances {lit., fees) to them, and after enlisting their elders or repre sentatives with some followers in Government employ on suitable salaries, keep them (elders, &amp;c.) at Cabul. So that the whole of the Turkoman tribe may become adherents of Afghanistan, and as they are much noted as irregular sowars, they may some time or other be useful in pro moting the strength of the Afghan Government. On the occasion (of the disaster) which has shortly to befall the Turkomans on the part of the Russians, it is most incumbent and necessary on the Government of Afghanistan to carry out the above contemplated measures. Should the present income of Afghanistan be found insufficient to meet the expenses to be incurred on account of the Turkomans, it is the duty of the Government to avoid other useless expenses and of necessity oblige this valuable tribe (with kindness) ’ “ His Hig'hness occasionally makes such observations to the Herat Chiefs who have come with the Mustaufi as to assure them that the Government is inclined to provide for their adherents, the Turkoman tribe, and to persuade them to inform the Turkomans on their own part of the intentions of the Government towards them.” \Secret, Janwiry 1877, Nos. 69-73.] 30. Turkoman raids in Persian territory; raid upon Boojnoord, Deragez, and Koochan. —Throughout 1875 frequent raids into Persian territory were perpetrated hy the Turkomans. In May, during the absence of the Governor, they descended in the neigh bourhood of Boojnoord, but were quickly pursued, and the captives they had taken, recovered. At the end of the same month Nur Verdy Khan, a leading Chief of the Akhal Turkomans, took advantage of the absence at Meshed of the Governor of Kelat to advance with a body of 1,000 men to Almird with the intention of plundering Deragez and Koochan. Abul Hassan Khan, the exiled son of Shuja-u-dowla, Chief of Koochan, at the same time attacked and carried the Persian outposts at Kheirabad, with some 5,000 Turkomans, and then advanced upon Koosh Khaneh, occupied by Kahreman Khan. The latter with 500 horsemen was defeated, and only saved his life hy escaping with a few men to Koochan. A large force was immediately despatched by the Governor-General of Khorassan against the Turkomans, who retreated in the direction of Kelat. In the same month a body of Merv Turkomans under Koojak Kali entered Kelat territory by the Derbend Pass, hut they were repulsed with great loss by Behbood Khan, Governor of Kelat, and Koojah Kali was slain. They did not however return to Merv; small hands of them infested Khorassan, plundering wherever they could. In October 1875 2,000 Turkomans, horse and foot, having entered Kho rassan by the Moozdooran Pass, plundered the country as far as Sagbust, and penetrated to Janhek and Sateimanieh, distant ten farsakhs from Meshed. The Governor-General ordered Ali Mardan Khan and Ismail Khan with a small force to proceed against them; but finding the Turkomans too numerous, they returned to Meshed. In this raid the Turkomans carried off upwards of 20,000 sheep, 70 or 80 oxen and donkeys, and more than 100 captives of both sexes. {Secret, October 1875, No. 107.] {Secret, January 1876, No. 41.] {Poltl.

He dwelt on the importance of Serrekhs both as regards Herat and Merv. He pointed out that the marauding habits of the Turkomans would still continue, and that a footing in Serrekhs would not onlv bring them so much nearer to Meshed, hut would give them increased facilities for pillaging Persian territory. Moreover, as Russia was undoubtedly determined to establish herself along the lines of the Akhal and Attiek, the Persian Government would be held responsible by Pussia for every act of brigandage committed by the Tekke Turkomans if they weie allow ed to settle at Serrekhs. The gravest complications with Russia could hardly fail to arise, and Persia would incur responsibilities which she was obviously incompetent to undertake. The Persian Government concurred in these views and instructed the Governor-General of Khorassan accordingly. In the meantime the latter had not taken much pains to conciliate the Merv Turkomans. During Koosheed Khan’s stay at Meshed, he was allowed but 25 krans a day, and on leaving he received only a Karmani shawl, while his followers merely got cloth khilluts. This treatment so x enraged Koosheed Khan’s son, that he vow r ed to organize a raid into Khorassan as soon as he returned to Merv. [Secret, January 1876, Nos. 42-45.] [Secret, February 1876, Nos. 47-48.] 32. Proposed Persian expedition against Merv.— These con tinued raids caused considerable anxiety at Teheran, and an expedition against the Merv Tekkes in the spring of 1876 was seriously contemplated. The force was to consist of 20,000 men with 30 guns. But the Persian Poreign Minister, who also held the position of Commander-in-Chief, was averse from the measure. He represented to the Shah that the expedition might prove more serious than they expected; that in the existing situation of the affairs of Turkey the withdrawal, of such a body of troops to the eastern frontier was to he avoided, and he advised that hostile steps should he deferred for another year. This advice was effectual for the time, hut fresh rumours of an expedition soon arose. It was said that the Shah had resolved to visit Meshed in the spring in fulfilment of a vow made on landing at Enzelli on his return from Europe, and that he would he accompanied by three regiments of mtantry and 5,000 horse. Mr. Thomson opposed the proposal, and urged that the present crippled state of the finances of the country could ill )ear re reavy expense of so distant a journey, that a second pilgrimage to a shrine which His Majesty had already visited was not necessary, and that, it the Turkomans did invade Persian territory, while the Shah was ir loiassan, re would have no choice hut to undertake hostilities against them ^ i remairi ^ le a ffair was ended, whatever it might cost in mec •i j J' loinson s remonstrance carried the day, and the Shah’s P 1° age and the expedition which it was intended to cover were abandoned.

The Merv Turkomans under the son of Koosheed Khan fulfilled their promise of making a raid in Khorassan. They attacked Toorbut, Mahmudabad, Hassanabad, and Kooyeen carrying off considerable booty. They were leisurely pursued by Shuja-u- doulah, Chief of Koochan, as far as Nooroozabad. Subsequently another body of Turkomans entered Persian territory near Payandigan. Yusuf Khan Hazareh and Sirdar Ayoob Khan, at the request of the Prince Governor, went in pursuit, but returned without having found them. [Political A., September 1876, Nos. 160-161, 163-164.] 34. Quarrels between Persia and the Jaferbai (Yemoot) Turkomans. —On the 6th March 1876 eleven Chiefs of the Yar Ali section of the Jaferbais visited the camp of the Governor-General of Asterabad. They had heard that Kalij Khan had urged their death, but disregarded the intelli gence. On their arrival, however, the Governor-General blew three of them from guns. The remaining Chiefs, including Beg Jan Khan, were retained as hostages for the payment of revenue, and fears were entertained for their fate. The frontier was reported in great disorder, and the Governor-General had altogether failed to realize any revenue. On the 12th March the whole of the Yar Ali section crossed the Gurgan and went to Goomesh Teppe. Overtures were made to them by Noor Geldee Khan inviting them to accept Bussian protection; each family to be taxed at one toman only per annum. Matters were brought to a head by an attack upon the Yar Alis by the Governor-General. The latter was defeated and wounded, and two of his personal staff were taken alive. These were slain in revenge for the three Chiefs blown from guns. It was said that the Bussians were instigating the Yar Alis in their resistance, in order that the Persian Government might be induced to surrender the frontier of the Gurgan Biver. On the 9th August a force arrived under command of His Boyal Highness Jehan Mirza, the new Commander-in-Chief. It was decided that he should go to Ak Kaleh with his troops, and the Governor of Asterabad with the local troops to Ak Imam, and that they should advance upon the rebel Turkomans simultaneously. Apasiab Khan of Nardeen and Yar Mohammed Khan, the Eelkhanee of Boojnoord, were instructed to be in readiness. The Yemoot tribes were con siderably alarmed, and proceeded to remove all their valuable property and flocks, &amp;c., to the other side of the Gurgan Biver. The Yar Ali tribe, who were the authors of the previous disturbance, were at Khoja Nafas and Gumesh Teppe. They were said to have sent a message to Prince Jehan Mirza offering to give up their captives and serve the Persian Govern ment, provided that the past were overlooked. Subsequently, it appeared from the following report submitted by the Mission Agent at Asterabad in December 1876 that things had settled down :— u The frontiers are kept in good order and are quite safe, and each Turkoman tribe is encamped at its own place. The Prince Governor is encamped at Ak Kala with his troops, and is engaged in collecting the annual taxes and revenue from the Turkomans, bio Governor has up till now been able to levy such a tax from the Turkoman tribes as that which is now taken. The Prince Governor is taking eleven tomans from each family of the Yar Ali tribe, and five tomans from each family of the other Turkoman tribes, although Soleiman Khan, the former Governor, last year was not even able to collect eleven krans from each family. “ The Prince Governor is very diligent in all affairs relating to the frontier. He has laid claim to most of the places lying on the sea-coast between the Gurgan and the Attrek which the Russians have possessed up till now, and has instructed Mohammed Kuli Khan, Darogah of the Jaferbai Turkomans, to collect the revenue of these places.” [Political, September 1876, Nos. 155-157.] [Political, June 1876, No. 198.] [Political, July 1876, No. 210.] [Secret, October 1876, Nos. 156-158.] [Secret, March 1877, Nos. 46-47.]( 34 ) 35. Overtures of the Akhal Turkomans for submission to Persia. Deputation with similar object from the Ersaree Turkomans— On 26th August 1876 Mr. Thomson telegraphed from Tehe ran that the principal Chiefs of the Akhal Turkomans, including Nur Verdy Khan, had arrived at Meshed for the purpose of declaring their allegiance to the Shah of Persia and had been summoned to Teheran. They had taken this step from fear of Russia, and in pursuance of advice given them by Abul Hassan Khan, son of the hereditary Chief of Koochan. The deputation accordingly proceeded to Teheran and was received by the Shah. The conditions on which the Akhals were ready to acknowledge the sovereignty of Persia are given in the extract below, which is a translation of the original document presented by Abul Hassan Khan who accompanied them. The Persian authorities were not believed to place much reliance in engage ments thus entered into by the Turkomans, and, on the other hand, the Persian Government was little able to protect the Turkomans from Russian aggression. Hence, it was not thought likely that the negotiations would produce any practical result. “ Translation of a document from Abul Hassan Khan, son of Shooja-ed-dowla, Governor of Koochan, to Rukn-ud-dowla, Prince Governor of Khorassan. “On the 27th of July 1876 = 5th of Rejjib of the auspicious year of the Mause 1293 the whole of the Tekke tribes of Atamish and Toktamesh having- submitted to Persian alle giance, 5,000 of them came in a body from Kizil Rabat to me at the Fort of Feeroozah, lyino- on the Zaaferan frontier. I intimated the orders of the Persian Ministers to all of them! The whole of the 5,000 men who had been deputed to act on the part of all the Turkomans of Akhal having yielded their submission, appointed about a thousand of their Khans, Sirdars, leaders, and chief elders to hold a special meeting with me and arrange the necessary points of their allegiance to Persia. “A* 1 ? £ tllese having assembled in order to prove the sincerity of their submission and future allegiance, they one and all swore by the Koran, and they, in further support of their statements, also affixed their seals to the same Koran. The agreements which have been entered into, with the several conditions thereof, are herewith written for Your Roval Highness' information.

The pay of the four Khans remains with the Persian Ministers^ who can fix the salary of each individual in accordance with his merits. An officer has been appointed for evury fifty horsemen, so that whenever they may be summoned, each officer will bring his fifty men with him. At present we are engaged in writing out the muster-roll of the horsemen, together with the names of the elders, and when completed, I will forward the same to Your Royal Highness. “ Whenever Your Royal Highness may summon these 200 Tekke horsemen to your pre sence, one hundred of them will remain at Akhal to prevent disorder and mischief in that neighbourhood, and one hundred of them with their two officers will appear before you to be reviewed. Their practice will be to come a hundred at a time before Your Royal Highness. “ They have engaged that whenever the Persian Ministers or Your Royal Highness should require a body of horsemen over and above the present two hundred men, they will give as much as one thousand men on condition that their pay be fixed. These men are to be first class, and have good horses and arms. They will be included amongst the Khorassan horsemen. “ Should the Yemoot Turkomans of Asterabad rebel against the local Grovernment of that place, and the Akhal Turkomans should be ordered to attack them, they have agreed to attack the Yemoots, to put down their mischief, and reduce them to full submission. “ The Russian Commander at Shah Kadam (Krasuovodsk) had sent letters and dresses of honor for the Chiefs and Khans of the Tekke Turkomans. The Russian General at Khiva had also addressed them inviting them to Russian allegiance. The Khan of Khiva had also written to them that they formed part of the Khivan subjects, and therefore belonged to him, and ought to join him, and that he and the Russian General would intercede for them with the Russian Government, so that they may be received with due favour. When I persuaded them and promised that they would be treated with distinction and favour by the Persian Government, and they gave their allegiance to Persia. They sent their reply to the Russian General and the Khan of Khiva, and distinctly wrote that they were Persian subjects and in the Persian service. “ It has been agreed that they are not to plunder the Russian caravans of Shah Kadam (Krasnovodsk), and that they (the said caravans) are to travel in perfect safety. “ After the Tekkes accepted the Persian rule and service, they requested that the Persian Minister should make some arrangement by which the Russian Government might not interfere with them, and that they may be protected from that Government. I have assured them that if they are sincere in their allegiance and service to Persia, they will be protected from the (Russian) Government. “ They have asked me to represent to the Persian Ministers and Your Royal Highness that the Yemoot tribes of Khiva, who have now become Russian subjects, attack and plunder them, and that they have no choice but to retaliate. The Persian Government must therefore be requested in the first place to make an arrangement by which the Yemoots of Khiva should not plunder them, or else if they plunder us, permission be given to us to retaliate. “ They request that two trustworthy (Persian) officers may be appointed to reside at Deragez and Boojnoord, so that the Governors of these parts may not accuse them of ill doing and making raids, and that their caravans may travel about freely. (For instance) after they submitted to Persian rule and accepted service they asked me to allow their caravans to proceed wherever they liked. Several numbers of their caravans went to Boojnoord, and Yad Mahomed Khan, the Eelkhanee of Boojnoord, seized them all and took their horses and arms. An arrangement must be made so as to encourage them and make them observe their arrangements. “ It has been arranged that they are to §end 20 horsemen as Gholams, to be always in attendance upon Your Royal Highness, and receive their pay from the Persian Government. Whenever Your Royal Highness thinks proper to relieve them on furlough, twenty others will come in their place, so that twenty of their horsemen may be in constant attendance upon Your Royal Highness as Gholams. s « The lands which lie between Koochan, Shadloo, Boojnoord, and the Tekke country, and extend from the frontier of Boojnoord to the eastern frontier of Deragez, have for a number of years remained unsown, and neither side have cultivated them. The Tekke Turkomans now request that as much as the Zaaferanloo tribe, the Shadloos, and the people of Deragez can cultivate should be allotted to them, and the remainder given to the Turkomans for their cultivation and pasture lands, and they will give one-tenth of the produce of their harvest to the Persian Government. For the present I have given no answer on this subject, awaiting your decision on the matter. “ Apparently such a step would not be without advantages, if the said lands be granted to them by degrees, five families and ten families at a time, and will come and settle there and beo'in cultivating the fields, and an intercourse will spring up between them and the people of this side. In time they will become familiar, their caravans will come, and our people will derive the benefit thereof. “ They will also give a tenth of the produce of the lands granted to them, and little by little they will be made to pay heavy taxes and revenue. “ In short the result will be that of their own free-will and choice great numbers of their families will very shortly enter our territory and establish themselves there.( 36 ) « Respecting the taxes on families and revenue, as it is the outset of the undertaking, and a nuXr of their Chiefs and elders were setting out to wait upon Your Royal Highness, I have made no allusion to that subject, and have not discussed the point until they have waited upon Your Royal Highness and are assured of your favoui and kind e . « The Turkomans of Karee Kala also came in a body to me, and have joined in the above engagements made by the Akhal Turkomans. They took a solemn oath, and have agreed to pay f tax of one toman per annum for each family. According to the number of their families they will pay a toman per annum. “ An elder also came to me from the Nakher tribe of Turkomans, and engaged to join the other Turkomans in the agreements they have entered upon. At the end of October 1876 the Turkoman Chiefs left Teheran, having re-sealed the above document. They took away with them a dress of honor conferred by the Shah on Nur Yerdy Khan, and a letter appointing him Chief of the Akhals and enjoining the tribe to live peaceably and abstain from raiding, in wbicb case they would receive the protection of the Tcrsisn Government. With regard to the Ersaree Turkomans the following letter from the Meshed Agent, dated 15th September 1876, narrates what took^place “ On the 1st instant intelligence was received that two horsemen dressed as Turkomans had been arrested on the frontier at Karat. The horsemen denying their being Turkomans, they were sent on to the Governor of Khaff. On arriving there the Governor enquired whq they were, they replied that they had consisted of a body of 16 horsemen, and had been deputed by their tribe, which is named ‘ Ersaree/ and are living on the banks of the Amu near Charjui, and were the bearers of presents and letters for the Persian Government, that when they arrived at the spring of Akar they were attacked by a body of robbers, who carried off fourteen of their party with all the presents. The Governor of Khaff demanded a proof from them, on which they produced the letter addressed by their tribe. The purport of the letter was that their fathers had served Nadir Shah of old and had been his subjects, they now also entertained similar intentions ; if they were ordered to Meshed, they would come, or if ordered to remain in their present encampment and be under Persian rule, they were ready, provided Persia protected them from Russian interference. Their presents had consisted of horses, dromedaries, leather and velvet boots, Bokhara skins, horse-trappings, &amp;c.” The course of the subsequent negotiations with the Akhal Turkomans is not altogether clear. In January 1877 Captain Napier found that Hajee Shah Mahomed Khan, the officer appointed by the Persian Government to communicate its terms to the Turkomans, had been escorted by a deputation to Noor Yerdee’s camp. The Turkomans eagerly accepted the terms offered to them, and it was arranged that a deputation should return with Hajee Mahomed to Meshed and ratify the agreement in the presence of the Prince Governor. Writing on the 23rd March 1877 the British Agent at Meshed reported the recent arrival of the deputation. He said—• The Akhal tribes are all disposed to submit to Persian rule, provided that the Persian Government also treats them with full kindness. The proposals made by the Persian Ministers and the answeis given by the Akhals are in brief as follows. The Government had instructed Hajee Shah Mohammed Khan to try and arrange that the Akhal tribes should pay a small tax yeaily. I he Akhals replied that it was quite impossible to entertain the idea of their paying’ any tax, for the lands which they at present occupy had been granted by the great Mohammed Hassan Khan Kajar who had also freed them from paying any tax. The Persian Government have also demanded that several of the Akhal Chiefs should reside at Teheran. The Akhals reply that it is unnecessary, as they have of their own free-will and choice agreed to submit to Persia, that they have not been brought to submission by force of the sword, that they t0 ' U P° n them -rdy to be left in peace, but rather they have agieed to be obedient and submissive of their own free-will and desire.

But it is the object of most of these frontier Chiefs to keep up a state of hostility between themselves and their Turkoman neighbours, as they derive certain pecuniary advantages from the system of raiding, and receive at the same time from the Persian Government considerable sums for its repression. The Persian Government say that the Boojnoord Chief will be called to account for this proceeding, and be ordered to restore the plundered property.” Orders appear to have been issued by the Ministers at Teheran for the restitution of this property, but the Boojnoord authorities disregarded them and were even said to have perpetrated a fresh outrage. The result was that on the 17th November the Meshed Agent reported that the Akhal Turkomans had renounced all hope of establishing their allegiance with Persia. At the same time the Persian Government remonstrated earnestly with the Prince Governor of Khorassan as to the neglect with which its orders had been treated. \8ecret 3 January 1877, Nos. 72-86, inclusive^] 36. Overtures of the Tekke Turkomans of Merv to Persia. —The Merv Turkomans were not ignorant of the negotiations com menced by their brethren of the Akhal. Before long they determined to send a deputation to Persia offering submission on similar terms. The Merv Tekkes are too far removed from the Irontier of Persia to be much influenced by fear of her hostility. The explanation of their desire for a rapprochement would seem to have been fear of Bussia excited anew by the latter power’s progress in the Akhal country. Probably also they would be influenced by their infructuous overtures to the Ameer of Cabul. At any rate, a deputation of 60 Turkomans, said to represent every division of the tribe, was sent to Meshed and arrived there on the 17th January. They were not very well received, and their proposals were laughed at by the local authorities. On the 15th [February they were dismissed, and Nasirullah Khan Jami, a petty local Chief, w r as sent with them to ascertain if they really represented the tribe. Nasirullah Khan proceeded to Merv, where he was well received. An assembly of elders was held at Kousheed Khan’s encampment, where it was agreed that submission should be made to the Persian Government if the latter would agree to maintain a body of 1,000 Turkoman horse and permit the tribe to settle at Serrekhs. In return they would cease raiding. The local Persian authorities, however, raised difficulties by demanding the surrender of certain guns taken by the Turkomans in 1861, a request to which the latter were unwilling to accede. On the 6th July Nasirullah returned to Meshed accompanied by some fifty or sixty Chiefs, but without the guns. The terms proposed were these : that the Turkomans should hoist the Persian flag at Merv; that 50 of the younger Chiefs should enter the Persian service and restrain their tribe from making raids; thirty of the Kalta Khans (thieves) were to reside at Meshed, and they and the young Chiefs were to be paid by Persia. Their salaries would amount to some 4,000 Tomans a year. In a letter dated 25th August, the British Agent at Meshed gave the following account of a Council at which the local authorities of Meshed discussed the Turkoman pro posals :— “ On the 22nd instant the Persian Ministers ordered the Prince Governor to hold a council, to discuss the advisability of retaining the Merv Turkomans under Persian rule, or not. A council was accordingly called, at which all the local authorities, high and low, were present. The Merves were then questioned as to their ideas. They replied that they looked to the Shah to keep and support them, to allow them pay for 1,000 horsemen at the same rate as that received by the Khorassan horsemen, and they would then prevent any Turkoman raids being made upon Persian territory; they also agreed to let half or a third of these horsemen do duty in other parts of Persia and to change them when necessary. They agreed to leave about 50 of their Chiefs at Meshed as hostages on a salary of 50 tomans each per annum. They added if these conditions were accepted, they wmuld submit to Persian rule, hoist the flag of Persia at Merv, and coin money in the ShalPs name. They were then asked what assurance they would give to show that they were in earnest; for if their conditions were to be accepted, 30,000 tomans would be added to the expenditure of the State. They replied they could give no assurance, but that they told the truth, and that in future they would also abstain from holding any intercourse with the Russians; that as regards the increase of 30,000 tomans, that sum would be saved through the peace and tranquillity which would ensue, through the increase in trade caused by friendly intercourse, and by the increase of custom house revenues collected. The Merves were then dismissed, and the chief members of the( 38 ) _ u • „ nrY , Q fr, fhp following decision. The first thing to consider was whether i£ thi S CO expendfture was undertaken, and the Russian Government intended taking wnetner it tms expe . Government interfere and prevent them or not, because f Merv andAkha ,would th rers,an Go Tarkomans proved false and threw off their likewise be lost. This deeision was finanl,, tele- graphed to Teheran.” On the 4th September 1877 Mr. Thomson telegraphed— “ I sent following telegram to Lord Derby this day : “ Negotiations with Turkomans of Merv referred to in my telegram of August Sth have fallen through, but Governor of Khorassan has been authorized to send five of the Chiefs to Teheran to discuss terms here. Should Persia succeed in obtaining the allegiance of Merv the arrangement would probably be favourably viewed by Russia, as it would prevent the place from falling into other hands, whilst it would allow her to remain inactive for the present in that quarter, feeling assured that she could wrest or obtain possession of it hereafter from Persia when convenient.” A subsequent letter, dated 2nd October, from Mr. Thomson, reported that the Persian Government had accepted the submission of the Merv and Akhal Turkomans, and would grant them 30,000 tomans per annum for their expenses. Twelve leaders and twelve elders of each tribe were to be sent to Teheran to arrange affairs. Mr. Thomson observed that nothing that had passed between the two parties at Meshed could be considered as binding upon either side, and that the final result of the negotiations would only become known after the matter had been discussed at Teheran. Mr. Thomson reported again on the 9th November that a deputation of 35 Merv Turkomans, accompanied by Nasirullah Khan, arrived at Teheran about the middle of October. They were presented to the Shah and lodged at the expense of the Persian Government, wdiile negotiations were carried on with them by the Mustowfee-el Memalik, Minister of the Interior. One of their number gave the following information to Mr. It. Thomson :— “ The Merv Turkoman Chiefs engage to tender their allegiance to the Shah and to have the Persian flag hoisted at Merv, and they agree to the appointment of an Agent on the part of the Shah to reside at that place. They consent to bring 200 families to live at Old Serekhs, and to place as many as 1,000 horsemen, if required, there to guard the Persian frontier from raids. They assent to these horsemen being employed elsewhere, if wanted by the Shah, provided they receive the same pay and allowances as are granted to other Irregular Horse in the Persian service. They also agree to bring one or two hundred families to Zooiabad on the Jam frontier, and to prevent raiding on that side as well; and they further engage to place a number of their elders and influential men in Meshed to reside there as hostages for their carrying out their engagements with Persia. v .

If therefore the negotiations which they had entered upon with Persia failed, they would return to Merv, and when pressed by Russia would go over to her. The alternative of fighting the Russians was of course open to them, but they felt that it would be useless to attempt that. The chances were with their undisciplined and badly armed force pitted against Russians regular troops and artillery that they would be speadily defeated, and even if they did at first beat the Russians and destroy one army, another and another would take its place, and in the end they must succumb. They would therefore accept the inevitable at once. The Russian Commander-in-Chief in Turkestan, the Yasim Padishah, had written the year before last to the Merv Chiefs to send their elders to him, and to bring with them the Russian named “ (ruiddeh/ who has been in captivity with them since the Russian invasion of Khiva, promising them great favors from the Ak Padishah (Emperor - ) and many advantages if they met his advances, but they neither replied to that communication nor gave up the captive, who is with them now. The Chief of Khiva had also written and sent to them several times advising them to join in with the Russians, as that was their only policy, and telling them that otherwise they would eventually suffer at their hands/' The next telegram, dated 21st November, reported the presence at Teheran of Chiefs of the JVIerv Turkomans and the probability of arrangements being concluded on the basis already mentioned. If they failed to come to an under standing with Persia, the Chiefs had resolved to offer no resistance to Russia and to give in their submission when called upon to do so. A letter from Mr. Thomson, dated 28th November, reported that the arrangements with the Merv Turkomans were still incomplete. The latter maintained their objection to the hostages to be placed by them at Meshed being accompanied by their families. The Persian Government had not waived the point— “ It is stated by the Merv Chiefs that in proposing to occupy part of the lands at Serekhs, they do not expect that the small Persian garrison maintained there should be with drawn, and from their language it would appear that the object they have in view in propos ing to establish a certain number of Tekkeh Turkoman families at Serekhs is that when the Persian Government are satisfied that no disadvantage accrues from their presence there, they may be permitted to occupy the whole of the lands at Serekhs and lower down on the Tejjen, these tracts being more suitable for the rearing of cattle than those of Merv, where oxen and more especially camels do not thrive; and that, moreover, if once established there, they would be enabled to locate a considerable number of the Akhal tribes, who threaten to migrate to their lands in the event of the Russians taking forcible possession of the districts they at present occupy.' Later information, however, (letter from Mr. T. Thomson, dated 31st December 1877) shows that an agreement has been concluded on the following terms :— “ 1. The Merv Turkomans declare their allegiance to Persia. “ 2. They engage that raids by them on Persian territory shall entirely cease. “ 3. The Persian flag shall be hoisted at Merv. “4. A Persian Agent shall reside at Merv on the part of the Shah. “ 5. One hundred hostages (men of position from the four divisions of the tribe) shall reside at Meshed, but without their families. “ 6. A body of 1,000 horsemen shall be sent to Meshed (about 250 from each division of the tribe) to be employed in the service of the Persian Government. These horsemen are to provide their own horses and arms, and to be under the command of their own Chiefs, but they are to be paid by the Persian Government, and they may be employed in any part of Persia where their services are required.' On the other hand the Persian Government agree— “1. To recognize the Merv Turkomans as Persian subjects and accord them protection and favourable treatment. “ 2. To defray the expenses of the hostages sent to Meshed, which may be estimated at about 6,000 Tomans a year. “‘6. To pay the horsemen furnished by the Turkomans for service in Persia at the same rate as that allowed by the Government to the Khorassan Irregular Horse, which will amount to over 30,000 Tomans annually. “4. To permit 1,000 families of Merv Tekke Turkomans to occupy old Serekhs and the lands adjacent on the Tejjen.'( 4,0 ) The names of the Chiefs who formed the deputation at Teheran are as folio w * ^ Kooiler, Sirdar of the Vekeel tribe Taree Batyr, Sirdar of the Bakhshee tribe ... ‘V Principal Chiefs.

The Shah also conferred upon them a firman stating in general terms that the Tekke Turkomans of Mery have always been and now are subjects of Persia; that all disloyal acts committed by them in past years are forgiven, and that, in consideration of their now engaging to act as obedient and faithful subjects, they will receive the royal protection and favour. The Persian Agent to reside at Merv will probably be Abu Hassan Khan, son of the hereditary Chief of Kuchan. The Merv Turkomans would have preferred Nasirullah Khan, but they recognized the fact that Abu Hassan was held in great esteem by the Akhal branch of their tribe, and that he belonged to a Khorassan family of wealth and distinction. A few matters of detail still remained to be settled, and if these were arranged in time the Tekkeh hostages and horsemen would be sent to Meshed in the spring of 1878. The report concluded— “ The Merv Chiefs believe that the Akhal portion of their tribe will eventually withdraw from the Akhal country and join them at Merv. They consider that it would be a gain for the whole tribe were they to do so, because the encampments they occupy at present along the line of the Atek are straggling and some of them ill supplied with water, and they are divided from each other by tracts of desert, which prevents them from rallying in time to support any portion of the tribe that may be suddenly attacked, whereas at Merv each camp has the advan tage of an equally abundant supply of water with all the others and an ample extent of fertile land, and all the tribes occupy a compact portion on the Moorghab which is very favor able for defence. Their lands at Merv are fully sufficient to accommodate more than double the number of those now occupying them. Three branches of the Akhal Tekkes, namely the Beg and Suchmez at Bam and Boormeh, and the Vekeel at Anow, have announced their intention of quitting the Akhal country and removing eastwards to the Tejjen or Merv in the event of their being again attacked by the Russians/'’ On the 15th September the Meshed Agent reported that Kousheed Khan, Chief of the Merv Turkomans, had died and been succeeded by bis son, baba Khan. ^ [Secret, November 1877, Nos. 81-82 8f 130-151; December 1877, Nos. 154-155.] io 37. General Lomakin’s movements in the Autumn *~7b. In July 1876, Mr. Taylour Thomson telegraphed that the Pen Government rece ived intelligence from Asterabad that General Loma iad called upon the Turkomans of the Attrek to furnish him on payment t r t S ’ r ^^ iese were to be employed in carrying materials for buildir 0r + ni^ 0 o St ^ Ucte ^ at some P 0 i nt between Krasnovodsk and Khiva.

Mr. Thomson doubted the Agent’s intelligence, observing that the number of General Loma kin’s troops was obviously exaggerated. Subsequently, on the 21st November, the Asterabad Agent reported that General Lomakin had recently returned from txhiva, and was then encamped about 32 miles from Kizzil Arvat. On the 21st January 1877, General Lomakin’s return to Krasnovodsk from Urgenj was. notified. He had gone thither to ascertain the practicability of turning the Elver Oxus into its ancient bed, and thereby opening direct water communication with the Caspian.

Alleged submission of the Akhal Turkomans of Kizzil Arvat to Russia. General Lomakin’s message to the Yamoot Turkomans— The overtures of the Akhal Chiefs to Persia were not overlooked by the Eussian authorities. In January 1877, they were called upon for explanation. Hitherto the Akhal Turkomans had always been subjects of the Khan of Khiva. A distinct answer was, therefore, required whether they considered themselves subjects of Persia or not. During the same month, Sirdar Eivez* Tokmah, accom panied by several other Akhal Chiefs, undertook a mission to the Eussians. They were well received, and tendered sub mission. According to later accounts, the ten or twelve Tekke forts lying between Kizzil Arvat and Kara Khan and Darvanf had also submitted, and agreed to obey whenever a Eussian Agent came to them. * Sic. Probably Evez Morad Takkmeh of the Seechmez section of the Ottemish branch of the Akhals, Chief of Boormeh, is meant. f Sic. Probably Dooroon. A further elucidation of the mission of these Akhal Chiefs was received from the Persian Governor of Asterabad. On the 20th March he telegraphed to the Persian Prontier Minister: — “ A few days ago it became certain that to spite the Chiefs of the Tekkes of Akhal, who , , ™ . had accompanied Mirzaf Abul Hassan Khan to Teheran Anez§ Quelhedy Tehmeh and Soofee § I can’t identify these persons. ja. hEn 311Q.

The Chiefs who had come to Teheran, despairing of aid from the Governor of Boojnoord and Koochan, have also tendered their allegiance to Russia. General Lomakin is sending expeditions to Kizzil Arvat and Bameh Boormeh, where they are to erect forts. He has sent persons amongst the Yemoots to hire 3,000 camels and likewise to engage 200 horsemen from that tribe, in order that they should be with the camps. He has sent a message to the Yemoots to the effect that if they refuse to supply the camels and horsemen in question, he will take them by force as was done on a former occasion. II Probably these two are El Geldee Kban and “ Hajee Noor Quelhedy Khan and Eel Quelhedy|| Geldee Khan, Russianized Turkomans and Chiefs of JA-hail and others Ot the Yemoot tribe of Noor the Noor AH section of the Jafirbae Yamoots. Ali Jafirbae are therefore now with the CharwalT noLd^™ , '' i '‘ ' t '' il&gt;0r “ 0n ° £tbe ‘'h 6 Wh ° are tribe for the purpose of engaging the camels and horsemen.” The Persian Government accepted this information as true. But it is evident from General Lomakin’s subsequent proceedings that the submission was by no means as complete as these reports would lead one to believe.( 42 ) On the 17th April the Meshed Agent reported the following details received from Boojnoord upon the same subject. “ The Affent at Booinoord writes that the Russian (General) who is at Krasnovodsk has J pirlprQ of Kizzil Arvat.

They are constantly engaged in plundering on the routes which we have newly opened between Khiva and Shah Kadam (Krasnovodsk). Up till now we have endeavoured to impress upon the Tekke tribes that they must not annoy those Turko mans who reside in the lands of the Emperor of Russia. We have done our utmost in this respect, for we will never allow any of the Turkoman tribes who are living under the protec tion of the Emperor of Russia to be ill-treated by the others. We are striving that they may be free from all ill-usage on the part of the Tekke tribes, and that no one should dare to inter fere with our caravans which are travelling to and fro. Notwithstanding this, those tribes did not listen to us, nor did they accept our advice, and they have again taken to plundering and annoying you and my other neighbours just as they did at first. This time I have received orders from the Emperor to march upon the Tekke tribes with troops and to erect a fort at Kizzil Arvat, and to keep a permanent garrison there. I have therefore sent this paper amongst you, and have given orders to my special servants, the Khans and the Kedkhodas, who will apprize you of the same. I require of you my good servants, the Khans and the Kedkhodas, that for this expedition against the Tekkes, you, who are the Jafir (Bai) tribe, will give 500 camels and receive their hire. I also require 500 camels from the Ak Atabais.

Defeat of the Akhal Turkomans and Russian occu pation of Kizzil Arvat. —Haying made all his preparations General Lomakin marched in the direction of Kizzil Arvat on the 1st May with two From Mr. Thomson to Lord Derby, dated 12th June Regiments of Infantry, 200 Cossacks, 1877, No. 89. 100 of the Jafirbai horse and six guns. It was also reported that several Russian officers had recently come to * Sic charjui ? Cliehar* Joo to make preparations, and had remained there a short time. The appearance of Russian officers here and the arrival of Russian troops at Akhal had greatly alarmed the Tekke Turkomans. In fact there was every appear ance of a definite move on the part of the Russian authorities to Merv. The first authentic news of General Lomakin’s proceedings at Kizzil Arvat was con tained in the following telegram dated 4th June 1877 sent by Lord A. Loftus :— Mr. Thomson 1877, No. 66. to Lord Derby, dated 12th May Official telegram from Grand Duke Michael, dated 3rd June, and published this morning, states that General Lomakin reports having been attacked at Kizzil Arvat by six thousand fekkes. Combat lasted four hours when the Tekkes fled, having sustained great losses; one killed and eleven wounded on part of Russians. After this fight the Khans and Elders gave their submission, and since 27th May all goes favourably.'” The following detailed account of the affair is taken from Mr. R. Michell’s Abstract No. XXVIII, dated 30th July 1877 :— “ The following communication to the Kavkas from the Russian encampment at Kizzil Arvat (trans-Caspian) is published in a July Enclosure of Secretary of State’s Secret despatch, rtfir .p r . No. 93, dated 2nd August 1877. number or tnat paper .— “ An expedition was this year undertaken from Krasnovodsk, with the object of occupy ing the Tekke fort of Kizzil Arvat, where it was intended to leave a garrison for the purpose of guaranteeing the security of the trade route from Khiva to Krasnovodsk. The force under Major-General Lomakin was composed of two battalions of the Apsheron and Daghestan regi ments, a company of the Samur regiment, half a battery of 4-pounder field artillery, half a battery of mountain artillery, and four pieces mounted on camels (the latter being intended for the fortification of Kizzil Arvat), the 5th and 6th sotnias of the Laba Cossack regiment, a rocket company, and a body of militia composed of Kirghiz and Turkomans. “ This force was assembled at Mulla-Karee on the 22nd April (N.S.), the troops coming both by land and by water. “ Leaving Mulla-Karee en masse on the 26th of April (N.S.), the force reached Kizzil Arvat on the 7th (19th) of May, and camped within one verst of the old fort. “ At 4 p.m. on the 11th (’23rd) of May a black cloud was observed in the direction of the Alchi-Ata defile, to the south-west of our fortified encampment. Our keen-sighted and experienced Kirghiz told us that this was occasioned by the dust of a large moving mass of horsemen and camels. Trusting implicitly in the Kirghiz, General Lomakin ordered out all the cavalry under Colonel Navrotski at day-breax to reconnoitre and to examine the Alchi- Ata defile through which the road across the Kuruk-Dagh passes the country of the Akhal- Tekke. On the following day, Colonel Navrotski reached the defile (six versts from the camp), and sent forward two Cossack officers to select a point for a picket, and a party of Kirghiz Turkomans to examine the road, while he came to a halt with the main body. “ The 9 th company of the Daghestan regiment being that day employed in guarding the grazing camels pitched their tents within three versts in the rear of the cavalry. The two Cossack officers, mounting an eminence, stumbled against our native scouts, who were being pursued by a party of Tekkes followed up by a mass of Turkomans, mounted and on .foot, surging up through the defile. So soon as the Tekkes saw the two officers, they rushed towards them with their war cry ‘Alaman! Alaman !'’ Thanks, however, to the excellence of their horses, the officers safely escaped, though followed by Tekke bullets. They had no sooner reached the camp when masses of Tekke horsemen pressed upon our Cossacks and militia. Our men began to fall back, but rallied in good time by Colonel Navrotski, they retired step by step in good order, turning round and firing their berdans. The falling back of our cavalry enabled the thousands of Tekkes to emerge from the defile, who receiving more and more support from on coming regiments, began to outflank us. The 9th company coming up and firing a volley somewhat eased the cavalry from the pressing masses of Turkomans. The firing being heard at the camp of the main force, the 3rd company of the Samur regiment was sent forward with a troop of mounted artillery; these soon came up, and some well directed shots knocked down a Tekke banneret and forced the multitude to retreat behind some mounds. Colonel Navrotski then called for further support, and two more companies, with a troop of field artillery, were advanced. Notwithstanding the very broken ground, the guns were soon placed in position,( 44 ) „,- f , i.r ■ 1 „ f 11 ,„ „„ rv ;, iea tilo Kirarhiz horses, and a telling fire was opened on the enemy. behind the r ste 0f thebi « our troops marie a o-eneral advance to the attack. The masses appeared once more on the crests and in the defile, hut our fire turned them to flight. Some of these fugitives showed them, selves on the hills in front of our camp, but were quickly driven back into the defile by our artillery fire. “ Our loss was one killed and eleven wounded. The Tekkes lost 2o0 killed, the number of their wounded may be estimated accordingly. We took four prisoners, who stated that 6,000 Tekkes had taken part in the fight, while there were 4,000 in reserve bor this successful issue we are indebted to the ability of General Lomakm, and to the bravery of Colonel Navarotski, but chiefly to the destructively accurate fire of our artillery, which, while it was effective, produced a great panic when the enemy was at a great distance off. “ Three days after the action some Tekke Khans came into camp with assurances of sub- mission and friendship.^ \From Asstt. Secy., Poltl. and Secret Dept., Do. 93, dated Znd August 1877.] 40. Attempt of the Russian authorities to obtain the sub mission of the people of Karee Kala, etc. —The Russians were determined to make the most of their success. They followed up their victory by a proposal to the people of Karee Kala and Nokhor to acknowledge allegiance to Russia. Karee Kala is on the southern slope of the Akhal range and its inhabitants are Goklans. They, however, referred the matter to Teheran, and the Persian Foreign Minister spoke with the Russian Envoy on the subject claiming Karee Kala as Persian territory. His representations were met by an evasive assurance that Russia would not take possession of any places to which Persia had a just claim. Mr. Taylour Thomson in reporting these proceedings observed that Nokhor certainly belonged to Booj- noord, and that the Upper Attrek valley was occupied by Kurds, who were not always submissive, but who acknowledged Persian supremacy. Subsequently, on the 23rd June, the Persian Minister informed Mr. K. Thomson that the Goklans of Karee Kalla had replied to Russia that they were Persian subjects, and that they held a document to that effect issued under the authority by the Governor of Boojnoord. The Persian authorities had directed them to adhere to this declaration. The Persian Minister proceeded that having claimed this territory as Persian and no exception having been taken thereto by the Russian Envoy, he thought that a protest now would only excite Russian animosity. The Persian Government, however, would maintain the justice of their claim to all the territory along the valley of the Upper Attrek, and would nowprotest most formally against all interference with it if Her Majesty’s Government would give them their moral support at St. Petersburg on the ground of the understanding between the two Governments to respect the integrity of Persian territory. r awnrpThnf rersian Minister said that his Government were perfe at a loss nnw +W t? 8 0 - ne ^ m P or tance to Persia, hut that they v the nrotest to Thic i 6 usslans b^ul returned to Krasnovodsk how to pre; extent The ’ S ° a§ n °^ excite their ill-feelings to an unnecess he should address a ^ ear ?^ ^ * n suc ^ doubt as to the manner in wl expe^°a decis^n S fnr^nm^ • ( * ovemmen t that Mr. Thomson should leave Teheran on a shnrf 6 1 G - lm f’ more especially as the Shah was aboul leave icneian on a short excursion to the hills.

Alleged claim of the Russian Government to the territory occupied by the Jafferbai Turkomans at Goomish Teppeh and its vicinity— In a letter dated 12th October the Mission Agent at Asterabad reported that the Chiefs of the Jafferbai Turkomans had represented to the Persian authorities at Asterabad that Agents had recently been sent by the Russian Commodore at Ashurada amongst their tribe, inform ing them that the territory which they occupied at Goomish Tuppeh and the adjacent districts (that is, the territory between the Goorgan and Attrek Rivers) belonged to Russia, and requiring that a list of those occupying that tract should be furnished to him. The Turkomans stated that they considered that territory to be Persian, and requested to know upon what grounds this demand was made; and they were advised by the Prince Governor of Aster abad, to whom they applied, not to accept any proposals made by the Russians, pending a reference by him of the question to Teheran. Mr. Thomson observed that the absolute right of Persia to all the territory between the Goorgan River and the left bank of the Attrek had never been questioned even by the Russians, and that it would be a most unwarrantable proceeding on the part of the Prussian authorities to make a communication of the above nature to tbe Turkomans occupying that tract. The Agent’s report of the matter required confirmation, inasmuch as the Persian Government had not as yet received any communication from the Prince Governor of Asterabad on the subject. [PoltL A., January 1878, Nos. 21-23.] 43. Captain Napier’s proposed journey to the northern frontier Of Persia. —In the beginning of the cold weather of 1876 Captain Napier having returned to Teheran, Lord Salisbury proposed that he might for a time be profitably employed in obtaining some further knowledge of the northern frontier of Persia. With this object, he might proceed before the winter set in to either Nardeen or Boojnoord, and, from one or other of those places, make such excursions in the direction of the Attrek as might be feasible. When a journey of this kind was suggested by Captain Napier in the winter of 1875, objections were raised both by the English Eoreign Office and the Minister at Teheran. Lord Salisbury, however, thought that those objections were overrated, and that, while military information with respect to the districts in question was much wanted, the visit of a British officer, in an unofficial character, to them need not give rise to any complica tions with the Turkomans, especially in the altered attitude which the Akhal Tekkes had lately assumed towards Persia, or furnish any reasonable ground of jealousy to Russia. Unless therefore the English Eoreign Office still entertained decided objec tions, Lord Salisbury proposed that Mr. Taylour Thomson should be informed by telegraph of wdiat was contemplated, and be instructed to facilitate Captain Napier’s journey, provided, of course, upon the arrival of that officer at Teheran, special circumstances at the moment did not render its prosecution clearly inexpedient. Lord Derby having agreed, Captain Napier proposed to leave Teheran about the 12th November, but his movements depended on the news received from the frontier. If it were true, as rumoured, that a Russian column was operating against the Turkoman tribes, it might he impossible or inexpedient to attain the main object of his journey. There was some doubt as to the co-operation of the Persian authorities, but this was removed by the strong letters of introduc-( 46 ) tion obtained by Mr. Thomson and addressed to the Prince Governor of Kho- ^ssan and the Governor of Koochan and Boojnoord. Mr. Thomson observed- “ The season is somewhat advanced for travelling m the north of Khorassan but on the ^ r j 1 winfpr months the Turkomans usually discontinue their raids, and this edcumsUnce toother with the fact that the Akhal Chiefs have lately been m Teheran engaged in negotiation with the Persian Government, which if they do not produce a permanent result, may be expected to lead to a cessation of hostiht.es for some months at all events, may k con- sideredas fctvorablefor the accomplishment of Captain Napier s proposed visit to Karee Kala,” Captain Napier left Teheran on the 28th November and reached Shah- rood on the 10th December and Boojnoord on the 20_th of the same month, where he spent some days awaiting the return of Elkhani Yai Mahomed Khan. He then started for Garmekhan, the nearest point on the Attrek, and arrived at Peshkalla on the 5th January, whence, having obtained an escort of 200 Shahdilloo Kurds, he proceeded northwards crossing the Googool and Ohandyr tributaries of the Attrek. On the 10th January he ascended the ridge dividing the Ohandyr and Soont tributaries, and fixed the position of Karee Kalla and of the principal peaks of the range dividing the Soont Valley from the Atak. On the 12th January he re-crossed the Attrek at a point about 60 miles below Peshkalla, and following the stream, arrived at that place again on the 14th January. On the 16th January he returned to Booj noord, and starting on the 19th crossed the Attrek once more and marched northwards. His object was to acquire further topographical information regarding the upper source of tributaries of this river which he heard were accessible from the east, and to ascertain the nature of the negotiations in progress with the Turkomans. He reached Kooshkhana on the 20th January, Giffar on the 25th, and Garmah, the furthest village of Koochan, on the 29th. Here he met Oraz Mahomed Khan, a representative Chief of the Akhal Tur komans, and received information which induced him to return at once to Teheran, where he arrived on the 15th Eebruary. He then submitted the following report to Mr. Thomson :— f ‘ At the time of my late visit to the Attrek frontier, negotiations were I found in pro gress between the Persian Government and the Akhal Tekkeh Turkomans. “ I took the opportunity of enquiring into the nature and probable results of these negotiations, and found such important questions involved, and such important changes in the political condition of that frontier imminent that I deemed it my duty to return as speedily as possible and place you in possession of the facts that had come to my knowledge. As to the early course of the negotiations I refer to, which have been now for some time pending, Your Excellency is informed, but their origin may still be somewhat obscure. Ihe point being an important one, I took some pains to enquire into it. movement was not I found entirely spontaneous on the part of the Turkomans, but had not at the same time been unduly instigated or fostered. “T'SrdT \T ? 0r xT e tw0 P arties ; . n the Kooehan State, the one supporting the presen le , e looja-u - owlah, the other his son who had been for some time Governor and is an mtiuential and popular leader. “ The former, together with the other Chiefs of this border, is opposed to the adoption of pacific measures m dealing with the Turkomans fnr c &lt;. • T p .• TinnncW nn fn c -i £ v A . urKomans, toi the condition of warfare existing conti nuous!} up to a late date has been their chief source of power and profit. &lt;» part of the -h. ..j Khan's popularity with tirTm-konmns ^wS th f the movement was due to the him to a tender of allegiance to thTsoveJeign 'f PerL™ ^ ^ ^ ^ Oraz Mahomed\hM, an inteUEent and^nfluenb £l ° m Tur , komans ^ among whom was one of the tribe, with whom I had formerly mad P ^ ° ne . the four representative Chiefs lay about midway between the two statements quamtance ^ lt became apparent that the truth “ On the occasion of Ahul Hasqnn K'V.oTa-’,, ± principal Turkomans had paid him a friendlv vi &gt; etU j n v ^ Kooc b an as Cover inviting a tender of their allegknee to Slt had with a message to the tribe result was a meeting between the youn^KW W . as responded to favorably, and the frontier village, Firoza. ^ * nan an&lt;:i a Erge concourse of Turkomans at the The conditions then proposed bv tho ivv. posed by the Persian Government i ian Were nearl y identical with those since pro- ernment.

The principal Turkomans had received only 50 tomans, £20, each in cash and customary presents of small value. “ The first result of this meeting was the deputation of the Turkoman representatives to Teheran. “ Without the active intervention of Abul Hassan Khan, no doubt actuated by selfish motives, it .is improbable that any overtures would have been made by the tribe whose access to Persia is in fact closed by the Koords, save when the Government of Khorassan is in very strong hands, as during the tenure of office of such Governors as Asaf-ud-dowla and the Hissam-es-Sultana. Hopeless of a hearing they would probably have remained in sullen submission to their lot until such time as the importunities of the Khan of Khiva, backed by dread of the force cantoned at Kransnovodsk, had compelled them to seek safety by an admission of allegiance to Russia. His proposals reached them at a most opportune moment. I be utmost fear and hatred of Russia had been excited by the stoiles that had reached them of the indiscriminate massacres perpetrated by the Cossacks among the Yemoot clans of Khiva. A council or gathering of the chief men of the tribe decided that submission either to Russia or Persia was inevitable and the latter was accepted by the council of the “Ishans” to whom the rule of their co-religionists, though Shiahs, seemed preferable. “The persuasions and gifts of the Khan had no doubt their effect in carrying the matter a stage further, but fear of Russia was, I am assured, the true motive influence. “ It may, therefore, I believe, be accepted that the movement is virtually spontaneous on the part of the Turkomans, and has therefore the main element of permanency. “At the time of my arrival on the frontier of Koochan, Hajee Shah Mahomed Khan, the officer appointed by the Persian Government to communicate its terms to the Turkomans was on the point of departure for the Atok. He was received at the frontier village, Germab, by a deputation and escorted to the “ Obah” or camp of Noor Verdee Khan, where he still re mained at the time of my departure from the border. “ I followed him to Germab and took measures to secure full and reliable information of what passed, while holding myself aloof from all participation or appearance of participation in the negotiation. The terms offered, of which Your Excellency is already informed, were accepted by the Turkomans unanimously and unconditionally, and they showed much eagerness to place themselves under the protection of Persia. “ It was arranged that a deputation should accompany Hajee Shah Mahomed Khan to Meshed to ratify the agreement in presence of the Prince Governor, and this deputation has by latest accounts, arrived. “It may be presumed therefore that between the Turkomans and the Persian Government no obstacles remain to the conclusion of an agreement which will extend at least the nominal sovereignty of the Shah to the edge of the desert bounding Persia on the north and secure a tranquillity hitherto unknown to large portions of the Shah’s dominions. The Turkomans see in the arrangement an outlet of escape from the impending dread of Russian invasion, and a means of relief from the constant attacks of their Koord neighbours. An unprovoked resumption of hostilities was, I was assured, impossible on their part. Raiding is no longer profitable, and the feeling of a majority of the tribe is adverse to it. At the same time there are a large number of professional robbers without other occupation and without ties, whose lands cannnot be altogether held. Measures are to be taken for restraining them, but it is impossible that thefts and acts of violence should not occur. “ Such isolated acts will, the Turkomans fear, give colour to the misrepresentations of their enemies, the Koords, whose interests lie in a continuance of hostilities. They will themselves too be provoked by similar acts on the part of the Koords, many of whom are in league with, and even employ Turkoman thieves. They distrust the Koord Chiefs, and obviously with good reason, and place no confidence in the officer appointed by the Persian Government to deal with them, who is to a great extent dependent on the favor of these Chiefs and has no respectable rank. “ If matters are left in the hands of the Chiefs, the Turkoman leaders fear that their people will be driven to acts of retaliation which will ultimately deprive them of the confidence of the Shah’s Government and reproduce a condition of open warfare. “ The fact that the interests of the local Chiefs are adverse to pacification is, I became aware, well known to the Persian Government, but it is nevertheless improbable that efficient measures will be taken to restrain them. They have much influence, and practically command all means of access to the Central Government, and all the sources of information. It may be anticipated therefore that the pressnt condition of tranquillity will not last many months, and it is more than probable that even the nominal allegiance of the tribe will be withdrawn before the end of the year. “ In the meantime, however, an opportunity is offered for the exploration of the Atok and of the outer range of the Khorassan mountain system such as has never before offered. “ The Turkomans are willing to receive, entertain and assist a British Officer, and may, I believe, be trusted to do so. As nominal Persian subjects they might be visited by an officer on the same terms as any other subjects of Persia, and the objection to incurring obligations, to expressing sympathy, and to admitting an interest in their political future, which were( 48 ) valid when the tribe was isolated and liable at any time to be at open war with Russia and to M under he slay are for the time removed; the poht.eal result of such a v.s.t would be to put “tamp on J recent negotiations, and to increase its importance as a measure of policy. “ The Turkomans would be encouraged to continue in their allegiance by the feeling that the, were thereby earning the taeit approbation and the support of the Government to which the, have taughUhemselves to look as their possible ultimate protector, w n e tie Koord Chiefs would fed that they had to deal with something more than a mere measure of policy adopted capriciously hy the powers existing and liable to succumb to covert influences and to entire and instantaneous reversal at the pleasure of a single Minister ol the Government. The, would feel restrained in their intrigues and hostilities, and feel it incumbent on them to be circumspect in their manner of dealing out provocations. ^These would be the local results of the visit of a British Officer to those parts; on the further political effects of such a visit it is unnecessary for me to touch. The fact could not but be noted at once and its true significance appreciated. A second question of much greater importance also presented itself to me, and it was mainly a consideration of the great advantage that might be gained by the submission of the earliest possible information that mpelled me to cut short my tour on the frontier and return as speedily as possible to Teheran. “ In course of conversation the Turkoman representative, to whom I have above referred, informed me that the Tekkeh of Merv were aware of the negotiations pending, and not only did not resent their submission to a common enemy, but were willing themselves to tender their allegiance on the same terms. They had deliberated, my infoimant stated, on the matter, and had either decided, or would shortly decide, to send a deputation to Persia. Being more distant that the Akhal, and free from all annoyance at the hands of the Persians, the full advantage of a state of hostility being in fact on their side, they are under less pressure than their kinsmen. “ The cause of their inclination towards Persia can be referred therefore only to their fear of Russia, excited anew by the massacres perpetrated on people who are their nearest neighbours. Possibly they may also to some extent be influenced by the failure of any appa rent result of their overtures to the Ameer of Cabul. “ The extension of the arrangement made by the Persian Government with the Akhal, to the portion of the tribe located at Merv is now beyond doubt possible, and I believe hy no means difficult to effect. Even if the tribe has not arrived at a decision in the matter, their willingness to entertain the idea is fair evidence that they might readily be induced to adopt such a course. “ A visit might now be paid to Merv, I believe both easily and safely from the Akhal f Atok' and the Turkomans of Merv would welcome a British officer, and would be furnished hy the tacit approbation which his presence would convey, with a decisive inducement in favor of Persian allegiance. “ There are, I am aware, further and weighty issues involved which demand consideration, but the solution of a question of much importance to national interests which now offers appears to me both practicable and advantageous in many respects.” Upon this Mr. Thomson wrote to Lord Derby :— “ Captain Napier proposes that he should now be permitted to return to Boojnoord, and visit the Akhal Turkomans^ encampments along the line of the Attrek, in order that he might by his presence there at the time of concluding and ratifying the arrangement contemplated, give to it the stamp of British approval, and that he-should afterwards proceed for a similar purpose to visit the Tekkeh Turkomans at Merv. ^) ie Persian Government have as yet no great faith that any really practical result will he obtained from these negotiations, though they are anxious to encourage the scheme and give it a fair trial. If the Akhal Turkomans, under fear of the approach of the Russians, and having &gt;eioie them the indiscriminate massacres which they assert were perpetrated by the Russian troops in their hostilities with the Yemoot tribes of Khiva, are really earnest and sincere in the desire they profess to embrace Persian allegiance, and mean to be bound by the engagement they make to live peaceably and not molest their neighbours, they have now the opportunity of bringing this negotiation to a practical issue; and it will rest with themselves m a great measure whether the result will be such as they profess to desire, or not. If, however, icy t o agiee o ive peaceably and act up to their engagements, and the Russians will consent ° 1 ? ! p e ?] 16 a,ltin §‘ ein 6nt come to, which is very doubtful, I see no reason, as far as Persia is become ^Persian tereitory™ 1104 beC ° me Pel ' 8ian sub i ects aDd the districts occupied by them they^remlk^ Turkomaus and the overtures which submiMokbeir 'nOtoto'i' 8 ''''t * n a position at present to compel either of these tribes to submit to their authonty or to enforce the fulfilment of such engagements. armroach of the ^ ur ^ oma11 tribes of Akhal and Merv are in dread of the tlmin in no other i Jn+ u? 1)6 appGarauce amoil g' them of a British officer could be viewed hy in their affairs amfif tl 1 ^ n 1 aS a c . ea r evidence that England intended to assume an active part ,n then afians, and if their hopes m this respect were not realized, the effect of his visit wouldbe prejudicial and not advantageous for our interests. To go there, therefore, unless with some well-defined object and in furtherance of some important political measure, would, in my opinion, be a mistake. ' “ It would, I think, suit our views better than any other alternative available at present if the Turkomans of Akhal were recognized as Persian subjects, and those of Merv with the Saryk and Saloor tribes, near the Herat frontier, were incorporated under Afghan rule. But with a view of obtaining this result it seems to me that we should rather confine ourselves to giving counsel in the matter to the Persian Government and leave to them the negotiation by which they should procure a formal declaration from the Akhals of their allegiance to Persia, and that we should not send a British officer amongst them, while the negotiations are going on or are being concluded for their submission, that submission being yet of an uncer tain and doubtful character. We could have no guarantee for its duration, and the whole arrangement, to which we should certainly be considered by all the Turkomans to be parties, might be set aside or not acknowledged by B-ussia without our being consulted in the matter; a result from which our prestige would suffer throughout Central Asia. “ The same course would have to be followed, it appears to me, with regard to the Afghan Government and the Tekkehs of Merv. “ The essential point would seem to be that the declaration of allegiance of these tribes, whether to Persia or to Afghanistan, should be acknowledged by the Russian Govex-nment, and this recognition could only be obtained at St. Petersburg after the necessary documents proving their submission have been procured. “ Russia might very well be asked when the negotiations have been concluded, and formal papers have been signed by the tribes in question, to acknowledge and recognize their allegiance to Persia and to Afghanistan, as the avowed object of the Russian Government has always been to secure in these regions a peaceable population and settled government for neighbours, which would afford them a guarantee for the security of their trade and the non-molestation of tribes which have already passed under their sway, and by this measure they would have settled governments to look to for the maintenance of such a state of things on their border, in the Government of the Shah, and that of the Ameer of Afghanistan. “ As Captain Napier has expressed to me a desire to be furnished as early as possible with the decision of Her Majesty’s Government as to his proposal to visit the Akhal tribes and thence proceed to Merv, I beg to be favored with Your Lordship^s instruction on this subject by telegraph/’ The question was referred to Lord Salisbury who advised as follows:— “ Lord Salisbury observes that having regard to the unsettled state of the relations between the Turkomans and the Persian Government, and upon other grounds, Mr. T. Thomson is opposed to the journey suggested by Captain Napier. “ In His Lordship’s opinion, however, it would be a matter for regret were the oppor tunity lost, which, unless circumstances have changed since the date of Mr. Thomson’s despatch, appears now to offer for obtaining information in regard to the Turkoman border of Persia, and he desires therefore to suggest to Lord Derby that, subject to the assent of the Shah’s Government, Captain Napier should be authorized to carry out his proposals. “ So far as the Akhal Tekkehs are concerned, it appears to Lord Salisbury that the un certainty which prevails as to the result of the pending negotiations and the permanence of any understanding which may be arrived at, is a reason for taking advantage of the present disposition of the tribes, especially if, as seems probable, the mere temporary presence of a British officer amongst them is calculated to confirm them in that disposition. a The expedience of Captain Napier visiting Merv is perhaps more open to question, but on the whole His Lordship is disposed to think that he should be authorized to extend his journey to that place, should he find it possible to do so without personal risk. u Lord Salisbury would suggest that Mr. Thomson be desired to instruct Captain Napier to regard the collection of information as the main object of his journey; to abstain from tak ing any active part in the negotiations pending between the Akhals and Persia, or which may be commenced by the Turkomans of Merv with a similar object in view; and generally to be most careful that the tribes are not allowed to entertain the expectation that in any attitude which they may take up towards Persia, they can receive material support from Her Majesty’s Government. “ I am directed to add that if Lord Derby concur in the above views. Lord Salisbury would be glad that instructions in accordance with them should be sent to Mr. T. Thomson by telegraph.” On the 13th April Mr. Thomson was instructed in accordance with this view, accordingly on the 16th April he telegraphed as follows:— “ The Russian Minister has communicated to the Persian Government a proclamation, of which I forward a translation by post, issued by General Lomakin to the Yemoot Turkoman Chiefs, making a requisition for transport camels and (?) notifying that he is proceeding to occupy Kizil Ervat, where he. will construct a fort and place a permanent garrison.”( 50 ) The question was then discussed how far this intelligence should affect the orders passed on Captain Napier’s proposed visit to the Akhal. Lord Salisbury did not consider that Captain Napier’s journey should be countermanded ou account of the threatened Russian occupation of Kizil Arvat. He advised that permission should he given to Captain Napier to proceed to the frontier, but that it should be left to his absolute discretion to carry out, modify, or entirely abandon his original plan in regard to hotli the A-khals and IVferv, according as he might deem expedient on arrival there, it being clearly understood that his personal safety was a paramount consideration. This view was accepted and Captain Napier was informed in accordance therewith. A memorandum by the officer containing the results of his exploration of the Upper Atrek will be found in Appendix VIII. Rut General Lomakin’s advance to Kizil Arvat related in paras. 37 to 39 above, compelled Captain Napier to abandon his pro* dated'sMay P i877. Napier No ’ 49 ’ P ose(i visit to Akhal Turkomans.—To the Government of India he wrote :—* “ Kizil Arvat is an obscure spot, and the small section of the Tekkeh Turkomans inhabit ing it may possibly be broken off from the main body and absorbed, or may be forced to emigrate, without any such general disturbance of the peace of Khorassan as would call for intervention, or attract very general attention; but its occupation is in truth the first distinct announcement of the intention of Russia to avail herself of the concessions which were some years ago publicly reported to have been made to her by Persia. For some time after the sub sidence of the excitement which the news of the cession of the whole country north of the Attrek created in England and elsewhere, no move was made, and the fort of Chekislar was even abandoned, but the independence of the Yamoot Turkomans was very surely sapped, and they were taught to look upon the Russians as protectors. This policy appears to have been successful, and General Lomakin apparently finds a sufficiently sure base for more ex tended operations, and can count on the co-operation of the Yamoots and the common of their supplies, and of their carriage without which his troops could not leave the vicinity of the Caspian shore. A new ‘parallel’ is in fact about to be opened, and unless more rapid advances should be considered safe, it may be assumed that in the course of a few years the Akhal fekkeh lurkomans will be lending their aid, their carriage, and their supplies for an advance on Merv. The occupation of Kizil Arvat, which will be, should nothing occur to prevent it, an accomplished fact long before this reaches India, is not only a fresh evidence of a fixed design o aggiession, but it is the boldest and the most important measure yet adopted. “ It carries the Russian outposts 150 miles on the road to Merv and Herat.

Opinion of the Government of India as to the mea sures to he taken in consequence of General Lomakin’s occu pation of Kizil Arvat. —The view taken by the Government of India of the situation and the measures they advocated are set forth in the following despatehf :— “We have recently had occasion to bring* under Your Lordship's notice* the open and * No. 41, Secret, 18th Sept. 1876. disre g ar( b shown by the Russian Government of No. 11 , „ 3rd May 1877. lurkistan, ot the repeated assurances given to Her Majesty's Government by the Cabinet of St. Petersburgh, that it re cognises Afghanistan as entirely beyond the legitimate sphere of Russian influence. Since then, Your Lordship has been informed by telegraph of the occupation of Kizil Arvat by the Russian forces; and we now desire to explain our reasons for regarding this event with the most serious anxiety. “ It will be in Your Lordship's recollection that, in 1874, the British Ambassador at St. Petersburgh warned Her Majesty's Government not to rely upon assurances then received from M. de Stremounkoff, and subsequently reiterated by the Czar himself, that the Russian f Lord A. Loftus to Earl of Derby, Government had no intention of organising any expedition 29th October 1873. against the lurkomans.f His Excellency on that occasion pointed out that the fruits of the Khiva Campaign could not be fully secured to Russia without bringing under her dominion the whole district lying between the Caspian and the Oxus; and that this would, at no distant time, afford a pretext for the pos session of the line of the Tekke Forts north of the Attrek and extending nearly to Merv. The opinion of Her Majesty's Ambassador was justified by the fact that, not many weeks after the expression of it, General Lomakin, the newly appointed Governor of Krasnovodsk, in virtue of orders received from the Grand Duke Michael, claimed supreme authority, not only over the Attrek and Gurgan Chiefs, but also over the whole of the tribes lying between the Caspian Sea, Merv, and Charjui. Expeditions were at the same time launched against Forts Chikislar and Karee Kala in violation of the northern frontier of Persia. “It is unnecessary here to recapitulate the communications which passed between the British and Russian Governments on this subject, or the reiterated assurances of the latter, that no advance of the Russian frontier, either on the side of Bokhara, or of Krasnovodsk and the Attrek, was intended. These are already familiar to Your Lordship. We need only point out that the assurances of the Russian Government in no way delayed the march of events, or falsified the predictions of Her Majesty's Ambassador. To us, indeed, it seems obvious that, even had they been made in perfect good faith, it would have been extremely difficult for Russia to keep the promises she has so profusely given, unless she were powerfully aided in the effort by the resolute assumption of such an attitude on the part of Her Majesty's Government as would, at the outset, have made it unmistakably apparent to her that the consequences of breaking them were too serious to be risked. For at the present moment, her position in Central Asia is much weakened, especially for purposes of offence, by the great gap separating her eastern forces from the Caspian Sea and the army of the Caucasus, which constitute her most formidable base for future operations in Central Asia. It is owing to this break in her line that her advanced posts on the Oxus, though within 800 miles of an excel lent base, are still practically dependent on Orenburg, whence they are distant more than 1,800 miles; and that the army of the Caucasus, with its trained soldiers and accumulated war material, can take no part in any operations undertaken by Russia in the Khanates, or to wards Afghanistan. It may be assumed, therefore, as reasonably certain that, even if the intentions of the Russian Government are less aggressive than they seem to be, its military commanders on the spot will continue to neglect no opportunity, and spare no effort, for push ing forward their forces towards Merv ; and securing, as speedily as possible, the only position which can enable them to connect their eastern with their western spheres of operation. In short, the cogent advice of her local authorities, and the strong pressure of her military interests, cannot fail to force this movement upon Russia, if there be appreciable prospect of its seriously complicating her relations with England, by provoking active resistance on the part of the British Government. “ It is not, then, as an unexpected act of aggression, but as an important step in a long meditated and well prepared movement, that we view with extreme anxiety the present Russian occupation of Kizil Arvat; and it is to the necessary consequences of this step, in connection with the line of policy it indicates, that we desire to invite Your Lordship's immediate and most earnest attention. “As Your Lordship is aware, the country into which the Russians are now advancing is occupied by the Akhal Turkomans. Although these and the Merv-Tekke Turkomans have come to be popularly regarded as distinct tribes, they are ethnologically one and the same race. The former occupy a fertile belt of country known as the Western “ Atak,' extending from eight to sixteen miles in breadth and 150 miles in length, along the northern slopes of the Daman-i-Koh, from Kizil Arvat to Askabat and Gavers; the latter occupy the oasis of the Eastern “ Atak' in and around Merv. A close connection has always been maintained between these two sections of the Tekke tribes. The Akhal Tekkes are said to look up to their brethren of Merv as the main body, of which they are an outlying branch, and to admit their liability to aid, if necessary, in the defence of that place. Although, by their geographical position,( 52 ) the two sections have distinct political affinities,-the one looking apparently to Persia fte other to Afghanistan, for assistance against aggression,—they are yet allied by kindred interest The whole tribe numbers, it is said no less than 30,000 hghting men out of a population of 175,000 souls. These men are fairly armed ; and capable, under careful manage- ment, of being converted into a formidable force for aggressive, or defensive, purposes. “ A distinguished military officer, who visited the Attrek country three years ago, describes the Turkoman as the finest type of a wild irregular horseman possessed of many admirable qualities, and tractable under good management. At present, from want of orgam- zation, he adds, the tribes would fall an easy prey to any European army ; but, should they ever come under European officers, these horsemen, guarding, as they do, the great desert which now, in some measure, separates Russia from Herat, would form a splendid frontier force. Such brave wild tribes are destined, in his opinion, to play a prominent part in the solution of that great question which so vitally concerns the rival interests of the Bntish and Russian Empires in the East. The favorable opinion formed by Colonel Baker of the general character of the Turkoman is corroborated in the main by others who speak likewise from personal ob- servation. Captain Napier informs us* that the Turkoman * Report dated 29th February -g no means the mere plundering savage depicted by kis 18 ^ 7 ' Persian and Russian neighbours; but is, on the contrary, exceedingly intelligent, shrewd, and alive to his own interests. Although moved generally by the impulse of the movement, he takes great interest in the politics of the countries round his desert; and is neither incapable of discipline, nor insensible to the advantages of civilization. Mr. Ronald Thomson also statesf that the Turkoman is not 1876 Rep0lt dated 29th February the irreclaimable barbarian described by the Russians and others; that he leads, on the whole, an orderly and peaceable life; that he is not an intolerant fanatic; that he is extremely hardy; and that he is, moreover, capable, under European control, of becoming part of a colony formidable and dangerous to any force against which it may be led. “The Akhal Turkomans appear to acknowledge the leadership of Nur Yerdee Khan, a man of determined character, who has acquired great influence over all the branches of the Tekke tribes, both in the Western Atak and at Merv. Under his guidance a deputation of the Akhals, fearing Russian aggression, visited Teheran in October last, for the purpose of tender ing the allegiance of the tribe to the Persian Government. The terms of the agreement, then come to, were,—the construction of a fortress at some central point in the Akhal country under a Persian Governor; the stationing of a contingent of Turkoman horse at Meshed, under the Prince Governor of Khorassan; the cessation of raids on Persian territory; the unmolested passage of caravans from Krasnovodsk to Khiva; and finally, the protection of the Akhal tribes, by Persia, against Russian aggression. This agreement was duly sealed at Teheran, where Nur Yerdee Khan was invested by the Shah as chief of the Akhal tribe. No t Mr. Taylor Thomson to Earl of sooner was it concluded, however than the Russian authorities 10tb January and 22nd March stepped in, claimed the allegiancej of the tribe to Khiva, and ‘ compelled by force of arms the submission of the chiefs of Kizil Arvat, Rami, and Coormah. At the time when this movement of the Russians took place. Captain Napier was about to proceed to the country of the Akhal Turkomans, with the sanction of Her Majesty’s Gov ernment, for the purpose of ascertaining the disposition of that tribe towards Persia. On earning, lowever, that a force had been despatched by General Lomakin against the Akhal tribe, and that this force was under orders to take possession of Kizil Arvat, he immediately ie mqms e t e undertaking he had been authorised to carry out; on the ground that if, to quo e is own non, this latest act of aggression is to be allowed to pass without opposition,’ ere cou no onger be any motive for his proposed journey to the Akhal country, where his posi ion won now e that of an official witness of its successful perpetration.

It would he a fine base of operations for any army; for, while the army in occupation would have abundant witer-communication, either for attack or defence, large Commissariat supplies and an immense supply of splendid horses to draw from, as well as a country, from its natural features, easily defended, an enemy would find it almost impossible to attack it with success when in possession of an European Power/ Mr. Ronald Thomson, also, avers that the soil all around Merv is fertile, and that the deserts guarding some of its approaches are easily watered. These are the statements of eye-witnesses; and, assuming them to be correct, it is obvious that, if there be no political impediment to the occupation of Merv by the Russian army whose outposts are already established at Kizil Arvat, Rami, and Boormah, the execution of that enterprise cannot now be long retarded by mere military or geographical difficulties. “It is equally obvious that the immediate preparation for, and early commencement of, such an enterprise have been greatly facilitated by the occupation of Kizil Arvat. The Fort of Kizil Arvat forms, as Your Lordship is aware, the salient angle of a vast triangular block of mountains throwing itself out to the north from Astrabad, and joining the main Chain again at Deregez. Along the south-western base of this block flow the Gurgan and Attrek rivers, either of which afford an immediate water-supply to a force of any strength landing from the Caucasus. Along the banks of the Gurgan an army can march, on the one hand, to Koochan by a comparatively level and easy road; and thence to Meshed through a broad, well-watered, and well-supplied country. From Kizil Arvat, on the other hand, an advance eastwards into the very heart of the Akhal country, along the fertile tract of the northern slopes of the mountain range, is not only practicable but easy. The whole route to Askabat and Gavers is well cultivated, watered by numerous streams descending from the ravines in the mountain range, and amply supplied with fuel from extensive desert jungles. The road, in fact, offers no obstacle to the passage of guns and wagons, guarded by a force which has only to defend itself against undisciplined horsemen. Numerous passes, practicable for artillery, lead from this route into Persian territory; and the Russian Power once in possession of the Akhal country, its further advance on Merv, by Sarakhs, in combination with a simultaneous movement from Charjui on the Oxus (where the Russians have, for some time past, been collecting carriage and material apparently for that purpose), will render reasonably certain, at no distant date, the complete subjection of Persia and Afghanistan to Russian influence. “ This will be apparent from the briefest consideration of the following facts. The distance from Kizil Arvat to Merv may be thus approximately stated:— Miles. From Kizil Arvat to Achima ... , ... ... 90 „ Achima to Abiverd ... ... ... 220 ,, Abiverd to Merv ... ... ... 210 Total ... 550 That is to say, the distance from Kizil Arvat to Merv is about the same as the distance from Quetta to Herat. This distance (regard being had to the favorable character of the routes which traverse it) might probably be covered by a handy well-equipped force in eighty days. We are, indeed, informed by our military advisers that, making due allowance for difficulties of carriage add the opposition of tribes, three or four months* time would still, in their opinion, amply suffice for the completion of such an operation. Charjui, however, is only 150 miles distant from Merv; and, although between Merv and Charjui there is a bad piece of desert, it cannot be reasonably expected that this will prove a serious obstacle to the troops who so success fully overcame all the greater difficulties of the Khivan Campaign. Thus, then, assuming even that we greatly under-estimate the length of time within which it is at present possible for the Russian forces to reach Merv, either from Kizil Arvat or Charjui, or both, it is never theless as certain as anything can be that nothing short of immediate, resolute, and most deci sive, intervention on the part of Her Majesty’s Government can now prevent the early incorporation within the permanent boundaries of the Russian Empire, not only of Merv itself, but of the entire district which the Russian maps assign to Merv, extending nearly to the walls of Herat. “The occupation, therefore, of Kizil Arvat, following so closely as it does upon the virtual annexation of the whole valley of the Gurgan, greatly increases the urgency of the question which, says Captain Butler, ‘ was constantly asked me by Persians and Turkomans, viz., are we going to allow Russia to take Merv ? * This is a question which the Government of India is, for obvious reasons, unable to answer. The answer to it entirely depends upon the policy of Her Majesty’s Government; and to the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government we now desire to submit it. “The importance which the Government of India has at all times attached to Merv, as a strategical position, is already so fully on record that we need not now dwell upon it, further than to observe that it is greatly increased by the piogress of events in Afghanistan. So long as we could reasonably count on maintaining a paramount influence at Cabul and Herat, the occupation of Merv might be treated as a comparatively remote, though serious, danger. But the practical result of the policy of passive expectation which has been for some time pursued( 54 ) by the British Government is that, during- the last four years, British influence has been steadily replaced by Kussian influence at Cabul; and we can now no longer reckon on the prevalence of British interests at Herat as a counterpoise to the presence of Russian regiments at Merv. On the contrary, the Power winch is first able to occupy that locality must inevitably command the western frontier of Afghanistan ; and if British policy ails to rescue Mery fr 0m the dominion of Russia, not only Russian policy, but the natural force of facts, will effectually exclude British influence from Herat. “ The political and strategical importance of Merv has always, we believe,_ been recognised strongly by the Government of Her Majesty as by the Government of India. But it is no Afghan Governments. The views * Memorandum handed to the Earl of Derby by Malcolm Khan in 1874. less strongly recognised by the Russian, Persian, and of the Afghan Government and its apprehensions as to the fate of Merv, were laid before the Government of India by the AmeePs Envoy in 1873, with a view to some timely agreement between the two Governments m reference to the situation which would arise if the Merv and Akhal Turkomans were driven to seek refuge within Afghan territory. But little attention was paid at that time to what was then regarded as a remote contingency.” “Malcolm Khan, the Persian Envoy at the Court of St. James, in a memorandum* which he handed to the Earl of Derby in 1874, thus expressed his sense of the importance of Merv :— ‘ Is it possible/ he asked ‘ for a moment seriously to doubt the aim, and the successful issue, of a policy which has been planned and carried out with such farsightedness ? So far as we are concerned, we feel sure that nothng more is required than the system of caravans, which are being organised at Moscow and on the Caucasus, with a mixture of the military element, to peaceably establish the Russian power on both banks of the Attrek. And then, what would remain to keep the Russians from Merv? They would be undisturbed masters of a solid basis; and, having at their command all needful resources, they would merely have to secure the formal submission of tribes who are already half dependent, and to traverse a tract as fertile as it is favourable to military movements. There is one point which will still further smooth the way for the Russian expedition to Merv; and that is, that unfortunately the importance of the undertaking will be completely veiled from the eyes of the English people. Merv, deprived of all present vitality, and lost among the ruins of Asia, seems to the European mind to be of no practical value, of no real interest—in short, it has nothing which can draw public atten tion to the invader. Russia may establish herself at Merv almost without Europe being aware of it. And yet Merv is undoubtedly the most important spot in Central Asia. Situated in a country of almost fabulous fertility, it commands equally Turkistan, Afghanistan and Kkoras- san. All the lines of communication for military and commercial purposes between Meshed and Bokhara, Khiva and Herat, necessarily converge upon Merv. In every respect, and espe - cially with respect to Russia, the position of Merv is infinitely superior to that of Herat; and tie very fact that this celebrated capital of Khorassan is in ruins, testifies to that superiority of position which, placing it in the pathway of all our conquerors, has marked it out as the blood-stained stage on which the barbarous hordes of Asia contend. To understand Merv, one mus not judge by what it is now; one must consider what it has been, and specially what i may ecome. o judge of Merv by what it actually is, would be like judging of Sevastopol iy w a 1 w ‘ ls ur ) er f lu 'kish dominion.

Both the British Government a „ foresee very clearly one result of cn 1 1G J ^ mee f Cabul have already shown that they Majesty’s Ambassador at St Peter Ann V* 1 oc&lt; ? u P a C° n ’ In 1875, Lord Derby, writing to Her mersburgh, sard-'They (Her Majesty's Government) cannotbut feel that such an event, for instance as the occupation of Merv, which would bring 1 the line of Russian territory into direct contact with Afghan territory, would arouse the susceptibi lities of the. Ameer to the highest degree, and possibly involve him in a common cause of defensive action with the Turkoman tribes upon his borders/ The Ameer, on an occasion » Cabnl Diary, 8th to 10th August ? lr eady referred to, showed his anxiety on the same score, and 1876. 18 reported to have said * m Durbar, not many months ago, that ‘ since the Russians have taken possession of Khiva, I have been under the impression that they would some time make an attack on Akhal, Merv Shahjehan, and other Turkoman territories; and that, owing to their misconduct, the Turko mans will hardly be able, to take refuge in any state other than Afghanistan, and will undoubtedly take up their residence in Badgis (a dependency of Herat.) Also that the Russians would ask Afghanistan either to guarantee the good behaviour of the Turkomans or allow them to punish the latter so suitably as to prevent future outrages by them. From what .1 hear of the state of affairs iu Turkoman territory, I think that my above-mentioned provision would prove correct shortly—probably this very year. I now feel great anxiety, day and night, lest, in the event of the Russians overcoming the Turkomans, and the latter taking refuge in Badgis, and the Russians troubling Afghanistan to become security for the good behaviour of the Turkomans towards them, Afghanistan may hardly be able to become security for such a multitude. “ That such complications would arise, it is impossible to doubt; nor can there be any uncertainty as to their solution. Herat is about 250 miles from Merv, but considerably less than half that distance from the boundary of the Merv district. For every act of hos tility on the part of the previously dispossessed Turkomans, the Government of Herat would be held responsible by the Russians. Every condition, and every plea, which has caused, or covered, the advance of Russia from Orenburg to the Oxus, would recur with augmented cogency in the situation thus brought about; and, unless the course of history were suddenly reversed, or the conditions of the situation materially altered by the active interference of the British Government, the occupation of Herat by the Russians would, within no very distant period, follow as certainly on the occupation of Merv as that of Tashkend on the occupation of Cbemkend, or that of Khojend and Samarcand on the conquest of Tashkend. Further than this, it is unnecessary to look. The occupation of Herat would mean the establishment of Russian sovereignty, or influence, throughout Afghanistan, and its extension to the present frontiers of British India; carrying with it the command of all the passes into North-Western India. “ Another immediate consequence of the Russian occupation of Merv would be the closing of our trade routes to Central Asia and Northern Persia. All commercial transactions with Afghanistan would simultaneously suffer; and, if our Asiatic trade were not altogether extinguished, it would be grievously crippled and depressed by the crushing weight of Russian tariffs. “It has sometimes been urged upon the consideration of Indian Statesmen that the Empire of India has nothing to fear from such extension of Russian power; inasmuch as every step forward, on the part of Russia, by taking her further from her base, must weaken her power of action, while increasing her financial burdens. But in the first place, this is an assumption not borne out by experience. So far from Russia showing signs of weakness as the result of distant extension of empire, her latest and most distant expeditions have been carried out on a scale and with a vigour, far surpassing all former ones in Central Asia; and, both militarily and diplomatically, she has never been more active than since the occupation of Khiva. In the next place, the occupation of Merv and Herat would not extend and weaken her military lines; but, on the contrary, contract and strengthen them. Merv and Herat are much nearer to the Russian base on the Caspian than Tashkend to its base, Orenburg, and the intervening country is richer; affording (as shewn by Captain Napier in his memorandum above quoted) an almost inexhaustible supply of military material. It wonld be far easier for Russia to create large military establishments, and more economical to main tain them, at these points, than at Tashkend. The probable result of the occupation of Merv would be the transfer thither of a considerable part of the military establishments from Turkistan. In any case, Russians lines of operations would be contracted, and her power for offence or defence largely increased, without any corresponding increase in military expendi ture. The cost of her posts on the Oxus, which is now very heavy, would be reduced by about one-half. “ Lastly—and on this we cannot too strongly insist—the danger we anticipate to India is not that arising from an adventurous Russian invasion. It is the far more serious danger inevitably involved in the extension of Russian influence over Afghanistan, till that State be comes a mere tool in the hands of Russia powerless to resist her commands. When this happens, as happen it must erelong, if not averted by rapid and efficient action on the part of the British Government, then our Indian frontier armaments, instead of being calculated, as they now are, to resist mere mountain tribes, without organization or combined action, will have to be recast on a scale fit to cope with organised and combined attacks supported by Euro pean skill, arms, money, and possibly even troops. India itself will then become exposed to an influence rival and hostile to our own, and with all the prestige of success upon its side. Every passing cloud of disagreement in European politics will then at once make itself felt throughout the length of our frontier, and send a thrill of hope to every discontented mind in( 56 ) India • and we shall then he bound, beyond escape, to accept, in a hopelessly unfavourable posi tion, the struggle for supremacy in the East, whenever that struggle is forced upon us. “To sum iro then—we believe that the occupation of Kizil Arvat is an important step towards the speedy conquest of Merv and the whole Tekke Turkoman country, that the oecn- pation of Merv is a step towards which the Russians are compelled by considerations of s «h weight as must override any mere protests on our part or promises on theirs ; that this event is a certainty, unless prevented by action on our part; that the occupation of Merv will greatly strengthen the military position of Russia m the East for the exercise of a commanding m- fluenee inevitably, directly, and most powerfully, prejudicial to oui own ; and that it will be necessarily followed by complications with the Cabnl Government, involving the occupation of Herat, and the extension of Russian sovereignty, or influence, over Afghanistan Feeling, as we do that these events can be foretold with almost complete certainty, and duly recognising the serious responsibility we should incur if we failed to consider and piovide lor them in time, so far as it lies in our power to do so, we deem it our urgent duty to solicit from Her Majesty's Government such an immediate and definite declaration of its Central Asian policy as may enable ns to co-operate efficiently therewith, whenever the occasion for action (which will probably be sudden, fugitive, and irrevocable) shall have arisen. “ For unless we are to be always waiting upon Russia's action, and thus always considering when we ought to be acting,—and acting when the time for action is passed away,—it is neces sary that we should know beforehand at what point in Russia's progress action is to be taken by us, and what the nature of that action is to be. _ As Central Asian affairs have long passed from the sphere of purely Indian, into that of Imperial, politics; and as the decision of the questions here reviewed must rest absolutely with the Government of Her Majesty; we whilst thus unreservedly recording our own appreciation of their special importance at the present critical moment, are anxious to assure Your Lordship of the gratitude with which we shall welcome the earliest possible indication of the measures proposed, or sanctioned, by Her Majesty's Government in reference to a matter so seriously, and so urgently, affecting the interests of the Empire for whose security we are jointly responsible. “ In considering the various courses open to us, we assume that we may put aside that of absolute inaction under all contingencies. For we believe that there is no Statesman, British or Indian, who is prepared to approve of the unopposed absorption of Afghanistan into the Russian Empire, and the extension of the Russian power over the mountain tribes border ing on India and the passes leading into its plains. At least, it has been repeatedly and publicly asserted that England cannot permit such a contingency; and unless we are to turn hack from all our past policy, and repudiate all our previous manifestos and declarations, this must be put aside as out of the question. “Many years ago, before the energy, skill, and resolute patience of Russian officers had surmounted those natural obstacles on which British Statesmen then relied for the maintenance of a safe distance between the extremities of the Russian and Indian Empires, the following opinion was recorded by Lord Lawrence,* the originator, and certainly the ablest exponent, of that frontier policy now popularly known as the policy of f Mas terly Inactivity^—No one, of course, can deny that the advance of Russia in Central Asia is a matter which may gravely affect the interests of England in India. No person can doubt, I admit, that the approach of Russia towards our north-western frontier may involve us in great difficulties; and this being the case, it will he a wise and prudent policy to maintain a thoroughly friendly power between India and the Russian possessions in Central Asia. Nevertheless, it appears to me clear that it is quite out of our power to reckon with any degree of certainty on the attainment of this very desirable end. And, after deprecating the measures at that time recommended by Sir Henry Rawlinson for the attainment of this end, His Lordship suggested that, if we failed to arrive at a timely and secure understanding with Russia, we should ‘ give that power to undeistand that an advance towards India beyond a certain point would entail on her war in all parts of the world with England.' „ ^ remains, then, to determine the point at which the British Government must mterfeie, and the character of its interference. The first question we desire to submit to Her Majesty s Government a question asked with increasing anxiety throughout Central Asia, and by our own Native subjects—is whether Russia will be allowed by Her Majesty's Gov- ernment to occupy Merv unopposed. The Government of the Czar has already been distinctly informed that the British Government cannot view such step with indifference. Lord Derby, m 1875, warned Count Sehouvaloff ‘ °f the great importance which the Indian Government a e . 0 . erv &gt; an _ 1( - danger to our relations which would ensure if it were meddled with;' aiffi again with special reference to our occupation of Merv, His Lordship said that Her Majesty s Government reserved to themselves the most complete liberty of action under all futme contingencies as to the measures which may, in their opinion, be necessary.' It now remain to decide whether any significance is to be attached to these words, or whether they are to remain vague and empty threats. wuiub, notice Jf them hv^Hpr 0 ^^ 1 ?^ S n^ eS t e d ^7 circumstances under consideration is, the the Russian authorities in cTntml^'^^? 1 * stron gP™t&lt;»t against the proceedings of ducive to an y practical result. OntTxpcIZ The BrS * Minute by Lord Lawrence, when Viceroy, on a paper by Sir Henry Rawlinson concerning the progress of Russia in Central Asia.—Cal cutta, 25th November 1868.and Russian Governments, on Central Asian affairs, does not encourag-e us to believe that a protest, even if well grounded, would be in the least degree efficacious. “ Another course would be a prompt and plain announcement to the Cabinet of St. Petersburgh. that Her Majesty's Government cannot any longer regard the boundary of the Russian Empire in Central Asia as naturally transitional, with an inherent right of indefinite expansion, and that England will regard the next step in advance as a casus belli. 11 The definition and declaration of a casus belli are functions of sovereignty clearly beyond the province of the Government of India; and as regards the adoption of this course, we only observe that, unless it were accompanied by strong material guarantees for enforcing it, or some simultaneous military movement, it would not, in our opinion, be likely to lead to any practical result more satisfactory than that which may be anticipated from the mere pi’o- test we deprecate, viz., soothing assurances certain to be broken on the first convenient oppor tunity : whilst if it failed to elicit such assurances, it would involve the English Government in a great war for a cause which uninstructed English opinion would probably regard as a small one. But, as Her Majesty's Government has already reserved to itself full liberty for the action which would at once become necessary if Russia rejected its definition of the casus, we can see no reason why such action should not immediately be taken, without expressly assigning to it any character which Russia could legitimately complain of, or openly oppose, as hostile to herself; and the sooner action is taken the more efficacious it is likely to be. “Were our relations with Afghanistan on a more satisfactory footing, the most natural and most efficient form which such action could assume would be arrangements with the Ameer, authorising him to enter into friendly relations with the Tekke Turkomans, and pro mising him our support in protecting them from Russian aggression if they choose to come under his rule. The Merv Tekkes have, for some time past, courted the Afghan alli ance, guided by a firm belief in the dependence of the latter country on England, which causes them to rely much on the aid they may obtain from it. But, unfortunately, it is now too late to think of this line of action. Your Lordship, in your despatch to us. No. 34 of the 19th of November 1875, pointed out that, ‘if ever the Russians should accomplish the permanent occupation of Merv, the time would possibly have passed by, when representations to the Ameer could be made with any useful result.' The truth of that prediction is no longer susceptible of doubt. But the steps taken by us, in accordance with Your Lordship's reiterated instructions, to effect by negotiation an amicable arrangement with the Ameer of Cabul for the establishment of British agents at Candahar and Herat, have failed; and it is now certain that, at the date of Your Lordship's despatch, the influence of this Government at Cabul was even feebler than Your Lordship then supposed it to be. So feeble is that influence at this moment that, during the reign of the present Ameer it will probably be impossible for the Government of India to effect, by diplomatic means alone, the object of the instructions addressed to us by Your Lordship in 1875; and, if it be still possible either to prevent, or to counteract, the speedy results we anticipate from the occu pation of Kizil Arvat, and the collection of military stores and transport at Charjui, by the Russian forces in Central Asia, it can only be by some means wholly independent of the co-operation, and wholly regardless of the resistance, of Shere Ali. “ We need not now trouble Your Lordship with an exposition of all the evidence which justifies this conviction; but we solicit attention to the following remarkable prediction by Lord Lawrence, who, in the Minute we have already quoted, thus strongly expressed his appreciation of the value of Afghanistan as a barrier State. ‘ I feel,' said His Lordship, ‘ no shadow of a doubt that if, a formidable invasion of India from the west were imminent, the Afghans, en masse, from the Ameer of the day to the domestic slave of the household, would readily join it.' The possibility of this event Lord Lawrence contemplated without anxiety believing that ‘all such hordes, however hardy, however resolute, however bent on plunder, could make no real impression on the drilled and iron ranks we could oppose to them on the plains of the Punjab and India.' We have already pointed out that an invasion of India is not the danger which now calls for immediate precautionary action : but it must be evident to Your Lordship that, if India ever is invaded, it will be by forces, and under conditions essentially and formidably different from those to which Lord Lawrence limited his calcula tions. Meanwhile the emphatic terms in which that Indian Statesman expressed his opinion of the worthlessness of any frontier policy based on the anticipation of Afghan support, or even Afghan neutrality, in a moment of serious danger, or embarrassment, to the British power in India have been amply justified by subsequent experience, and are significantly, re-echoed in th e subjoined extract from a recent report by one of our most experienced Native Agents :— ‘There is no gainsaying this, that, if the present mode of friendship, and occasionally helping the Afghan Government with arms and money, is continued for another century, and a desire is then expressed of any advances of interests in that country, the fruit of a hundred years' friendship and friendly offices will be nothing more than what it has now shown itself to be, i. e., the preparation of jehad and religious war. “Next to Afghanistan, the country best situated for helping the Tekke Turkomans against Russia and to which they most naturally look for assistance, is Persia. ‘ But here we are met with the difficulty of not knowing whether the relations between Her Majesty's Government and the Shah are such as to hold out any hopes of enlisting the services of the latter in prompt and practical efforts to stem the progress of Russia. When Persia once before enquired if the British Government would support her in a protest against the Russian occupation of Karee( 58 ) K., it declined to inter^ n^eKn rorr^FeTorfo'^*,™ time should be lost in making* every possible effort to restore British influence at Teheran, and arrest the process which is now rapidly converting Persia into a state vassal to Russia. The attainment of this object appears to us of such urgent impoitance that, if the chance or means of attaining it be stili open to Her Majesty's Government, Your Lordship may reckon on our willing co-operation, even at some pecuniary sacrifice, m any leally practical efforts for that purpose. “We are decidedly of opinion that, in the anxious and urgent circumstances to which Your Lordship's attention is here invited, no arrangement with Persia will be of practical benefit to this Empire, if it does not include the establishment of Bntish agents with a suitable escorts at Meshed or Sarakhs, and free access to Merv, through Persian territory. If there be any prospect of some such arrangement, we would suggest, for the consideration of Your Lordship, whether it might not, in the meanwhile, be desirable to employ British officers in organising the powers of resistance of the IVTeiv Tuikomans to such an extent as would, at least, secure Merv from a coup-de-main on the part of Russia, and compel the latter to move cautiously securing her position well before she attempts further advances. ♦This would, at least, g*ain time, which, at the present moment, is a most important object. But unless material guarantees are previously, or simultaneously, taken by Her Majesty's Government to prevent the policy of Persia in these regions from falling completely under the control of Russian influence, any measure likely to render Merv more dependent on that country would, instead of being beneficial to Indian interests, only increase the embarrassments and dangers of our present situation. “ The next course which suggests itself, and the one to which we desire especially to invite Your Lordship's consideration, is that of opening direct communication with' the Tekke Turkomans. In accordance, therefore, with the views expressed in the preceding paragraph, we solicit authority to despatch at once to Merv one or more selected officers. Their instructions should be, in the first place, to ascertain, as well as they can, the real powers of resistance of the Turkomans; the imminence of the danger to them from Russia; their feelings regarding a Russian conquest; their disposition towards Persia, towards Afghanistan, and towards ourselves; and the extent to which they are prepared to resist Russia. The officers should carefully avoid committing us in any way until they have satisfied themselves on these points. If they consider that the Turkomans have not in them selves the elements of successful resistance, for a time at least, or are not in earnest in wishing to resist, and are prepared 'at the first summons, to yield to Russia, they can return; and, with the advan age of the additional and direct information thus acquired, we shall be in the best position to consider what further steps should then be taken. If, on the other hand, they are satisfied of the desire and ability of the Turkomans to resist successfully an immediate advance of the Russians, they will encourage them in their resistance, assist them in organising it; and we wdl send more officers with money, and, if possible, arms also to their assistance. In making this proposal, we have fully considered the objections which will be urged against it, and which fall principally under two heads,—first, that such proceedings are irre gular and unfriendly, and would endanger our relations with Russia; and, secondly, that they would involve us in embarrassing responsibilities towards the Turkomans, and a risk of failure injurious to our prestige. As regards the first objection, Her Majesty's Government must be fully aware that Russ : an no ouise ves, is responsible for any irregularity, or disturbance of our relations that mig arise from such a step. Her Majesty’s Government have repeatedly pointed out to the Go fhp'rv, 1 16 f e n ee n i® S f^Y would view a Russian advance on Merv, at efl ^tinmen 0 ie zar as given repeated assurances that no such movement was intern aL,?„n E enCe H T lt,S Y 0ffiCerS at M f V can onl y be “ unfriendly act, on tl ourarnowwd,n at ( a h k f OI1 i MerT “d ntended: anadmis sion which Russia cannot make will warnint-s arndfo L„ #r o£ *&gt;«»*. i-deliberate disregard of o. reservi to itself the fuCriTberty of‘‘Sr* 0386 ’ GoTerament has es f’ ecia ' Hitherto we have^wnerlllY^Lv^ V *' I T probable ; but we consider this in itself a ga position which is^alwivd l 6 ™.

If failure seems probable, either from want of means of resistance, or from indifference, or dread of the Russian power, he will return without having committed himself, or the British Government: and, in any case, he will be careful to explain that the British Government is debarred by distance from giving direct military help There must still always remain a possible risk of failure, and consequent loss of prestige • but this applies equally to every alternative line of action, and is less applicable to the one proposed than to any other. If to check Russians advance, England goes to war with her, she submits to the certain loss of thousands of lives, and millions of money, and still runs the risk of failure. If we try to meet it by an armed opposition in Afghanistan, we still incur the certainty of pecuniary sacrifices, without avoiding the risk of failure to which all military undertakings are necessarily liable. If we allow Russia to advance unopposed to our Indian boundaries, we incur a, loss of prestige fully equal to many failures, and, after all, have to submit to enormously increased permanent charges consequent on the necessity of placing our military establishment on a footing suitable to the altered conditions. It appears to us therefore, that the objection applies considerably less to the course above suggested than to any other line of action, or inaction, which is open to us. On the assumption that the Russians, if unforbidden by Her Majesty’s Government will advance from Kizil Arvat with all possible rapidity, we are forced to exclude from consi deration the possibility of preventing the occupation of Merv by military operations on our part; because, in that case, such operations must necessarily be too late. The distance from Kizil Arvat to Merv is, as already pointed out in paragraph 11, about 550 miles; from Char- jui to Merv is about 150. The former distance could probably be covered in three months at the outside; the road lying the whole way through a rich and open country. The latter could be ciossed. m a much shoiter time, though at this point the desert presents more serious obstacles ; but it is known that the Russians have long been collecting transport at Charjui, and making preparations which would materially facilitate such an attempt. On the other hand, some months at least would be required even to prepare an expeditionary force from India. Such piepaiations could not be concealed from Russia, and would necessarily hurry the execution of any design entertained by her against Merv. Probably, before the expedi tion had left the banks of the Indus, certainly before it had advanced any distance into Afghan istan, the Russians would be already established at Merv. “ An alliance, openly protected by the British Government, between the Merv-Turkomans and the Afghans, with whom they are already connected by the ties of sympathy, tradition, and interest, or the incorporation of Merv with Afghanistan, would be preferable to similar arrangements with Persia on behalf of that place, and more advantageous to the British Empire in India that any other diplomatic settlement, if the British Government were now in a posi tion to exercise over the Afghan Power that friendly, legitimate, and salutary influence which has so long been the declared object of its policy. But unfortunately this is not as yet the case; and, since the Russian occupation of Merv would be particularly inopportune at the pre sent moment, when we have no influence or party in Afghanistan, we solicit early and definite instructions on the various questions submitted by us to Your Lordship’s consideration in connec tion with the urgent requirements of the position we are placed in by the circumstances here under review. “ Even, if Her Majesty’s Government decides in favor of postponing all action until after the event here contemplated, it will still be desirable that the Government of India should learn, as soon as may be conveniently possible, the views of Her Majesty’s Govern ment on the situation which must then be dealt with, the action it would be prepared to take for preventing a further advance of Russia towards India, and the extent to which the Government of India will be expected to co-operate in such action. “ If Merv be occupied by Russian troops, while British agents are excluded from Western Afghanistan, the question of Russian or British supremacy in Afghanistan will be virtually decided. The only possible counterpoise to such an advance on the part of Russia is the establish ment of a commanding British influence at Herat, visibly represented by the presence of an agent, and supported by assurances of material assistance, should Russia attempt further advances. Towards this object our recent negotiations with the Ameer were directed, but thus far they have been unsuccessful. We do not yet despair entirely of the Ameer being brought to a truer sense of his interests. But we regard such an event as extremely im probable; more specially within any period of time sufficiently short to justify the postpone ment of all action on our part for the sake of ultimately securing the co-operation of His Highness. We have, therefore, to consider what will be our position, if the Ameer continues to reject all offers of our assistance or alliance, while Russia increases her influence at Cabul, and from Merv commands Herat. We shall then be obliged to choose between surrendering Afghanistan altogether to Russia, or taking more vigorous action than we have yet taken to secure our interests there. “The surrender of Afghanistan to undisputed Russian influence would, in our opinion, necessarily involve the abandonment of Peshawur, and the acceptance of the Indus as the limit of British territory towards the north-west of India. For, unless we were able to command the passes of it, our present mountain frontier would be, not only indefensible, but dangerously( 60 ) provocative to attack Bat the abandonment of our present frontier would be tantamount to the abandonment of the whole Empire : inasmuch as our possession of the rest of India could not possibly survive such a humiliation. _ a The British Power in India is chiefly maintained on political ciedip If that credit be lost, or seriously damaged, the practical liquidation of the Imperial _ liabilities it represents, will demand a permanent expenditure, for which the Indian Treasury is now, and must ever remain, absolutely unable to provide. Her Majesty s Government will then he constrained to incur either the national humiliation involved in proved inability to preserve for the British Crown one of the most important, most renowned, and most glorious of its great dependencies, or else those extensive and increasing charges which cannot be borne by the financial resources of the dependency itself, but without which it would be impossible to maintain in India a military establishment permanently large enough, and strong enough, to overawe a vast alien population when that population has lost confidence in the foresight and firmness of our dominion. “We are fully aware that there are still some English publicisfs and politicians who cherish a strong impression that, if the British and Bussian frontieis were conterminous in Central Asia, the result, so far from being disadvantageous to the true interests of this Empire, would be eminently beneficial to its peace and security. It would also, in their opinion, pro mote human welfare and social progress, by bringing under the beneficent authority of civilized Christian Government all those turbulent territories now troubled by fanatical tribes and mis- ruled by barbaric princes. But unfortunately these consolatory theories, like dreams of univer sal peace and general disarmament, are contradicted by a sadly stern experience. Geographical contact between civilized nations in Europe has neither abolished wars nor rendered unnecessary the maintenance of military establishments. On the contrary, it has lamentably increased the intensity of the former, and the magnitude of the latter. In any case, we, who are specially charged with the duty of preserving and promoting the welfare of Her Majesty’s Indian sub jects, can anticipate from such contact between Russia and the Empire for whose security we are responsible nothing but prolonged anxieties and augmented military burdens. If such contact is to be the result of incessant successful advance on the part of Russia, and simultaneous political, or territorial, retrogression on our own part involving the enforced abandonment of positions long held, or claimed, by us, before the world, then we feel certain that it will soon be entirely beyond our power to control the duration, or fix the term, of this retreating process. “Meanwhile, the rapidly increasing interest with which the persistent approach of Russia is now watched and discussed by our native subjects significantly indicates the danger of its unchecked progress. Indeed, it is not, we think, too much to say that, already, the Russian and British Empires are unavoidably competitors for a moral dominion over the native races of India; and that the final issue of the silent but active competition thus commenced is mainly dependent on the manner in which the reality and importance of it are appreciated by Her Majesty’s Government. Whilst, therefore, it is to the possibility of friendly relations with Afghanistan, and the peaceful establishment of our influence over that country on a footing adequately spacious and secure, that we still look for the best solution of the problem now before us, we cannot conceal from om’selves, or from the Government of Her Majesty, that the time may come (and at no very distant date) when, in order to maintain the British Power in India, it will be absolutely necessary to undertake the military occupation of Western Afghanistan (whether with, or without, the consent of the Ruler of that country), including the important fortress of Herat. I he position of the present Ameer is evidently very precarious; and it is possible that the course of events may result in the dismemberment of his kingdom, and the formation of a separate Khanate in W estern Afghanistan, which it might be quite feasible to bring under Butish influence and protection It was long ago pointed out by Lord Lawrence that ‘it will ovwprn 6 f°' ln Af X |) ee • 1 ^ ^ difficult to maintain, for any extended period, a united and strong fn the p n fl Stai1 ' ^ ? enius/ he ob served, ‘of the chiefs and people, as evinced l athan . com ™ umtles of the border, is evidenced to this effect!

That we should be prepared to take such political and military measures as the course of events may render necessary, to prevent Russia from obtaining 1 a footing 1 , or even a domi nant moral influence, in Afghanistan. “ We have now placed fully and frankly before Your Lordship our views of the serious situation in which we find ourselves placed by the latest events in Central Asia. We have also indicated the only measures which appear to us either expedient or possible for the timely amelioration of that situation. In doing so, we have not been unmindful that the frontier relations of the Indian Empire must be practically governed by the foreign policy of Her Majesty’s Government. We do not, therefore, desire or presume to determine the character of that policy. But we solicit, for our guidance through the difficulties and dangers now rapidly gathering around us, an early and a clear definition of it. The interests committed to our charge cannot but be materially affected by Your Lordship’s appreciation of the facts in reference to which we anxiously await your instructions. Wb have, therefore, taken this opportunity of placing on record our anxiety to co-operate cordially in the prompt prosecution of any practical scheme adopted, or sanctioned, by Her Majesty’s Government for the protec tion of those inteiests, which, after prolonged and most careful consideration, we seriously believe to be imminently menaced at the present moment. Should Her Majesty s Government be unable, either to sanction some such policy as we have here submitted to Your Lordship s consideration, or to commend to our own adoption any other of a more vigorous and practical character, we fear that it will be entirely beyond our power to avert the dangers we foresee, or to repair the consequences of their long neglected progress.” [Secret, Nov. 1877, No. 129.] 45. Mr. Taylour Thomson’s opinion of the Russian occu pation of Kizzil Arvat and of the policy to be adopted with reference to Merv. —In Mr. Thomson’s opinion there was no doubt that the occupation of the whole line of country from the shores of the Caspian by Kizzil Aryat and the Atrek on to Mery and the Oxus including Serrekhs and eventually the districts of South Merv on the banks of the Moorghab had been for a long time a fixed resolution of the Russian Government. The time of its entire realization depended upon the success of Russian policy in regard to the Turkoman tribes and upon the amount of opposition which might be offered by England. The difficulty experienced by the Russians in sinking wells on the line of road between Krasnovodsk and Khiva would afford a further reason for accelerating the movement along the line of the Atrek. He alluded to the heavy additional expenditure which would be necessary in India when the frontiers of a strong European power like Russia were coterminous with our own. Subsequently Mr. Thomson furnished the Government of India with a copy of the following despatch which he had submitted to Lord Derby:— “ In the year 1873, when Russia was engaged in hostilities with Khiva, and had declared that she would not annex that Principality, I suggested in my despatch, No. 21 of the 24th of April, that it might be advantageous to recognize her as the dominant power in Khiva, provided that she withdrew from the districts on the right bank of the Lower Attrek, which position I considered to be as great a menace to England as to Persia, and that the 40th Parallel of Latitude, extending from Krasnovodsk to the Oxus, should be considered to be her line of frontier in the direction of Persia and Afghanistan. This would have afforded the obvious advantage of a belt of desert waste dividing her territory from that of Persia and from the districts inhabited by the Tekkeh Turkomans of Merv and Akhal. Subsequent events, however, have set aside such speculations. “ The Russians are now the de facto Rulers in Khiva, and they are also in possession of the territory along the right bank of the Lower Attrek, as well as of the intervening district northwards to Krasnovodsk: and their recent advance on Kizzil Arvat, and demand that the people of Karee Kala should declare allegiance to Russia, leave no doubt whatever that the occupation of the Upper, as well as the Lower Attrek, and of the Akhal country, will follow as soon as the moment is deemed favorable. “ If it be admitted that the presence of Russia in these places is prejudicial to British in terests and policy, now is the time to decide whether she may be prevented, and by what means from occupying them. “ It is very doubtful whether Persia would or could give any real aid in the furtherance of this object. Feeling herself unable, if unaided, to obtain for herself the possession of the Akhal country, she would prefer having the Russians there to being as heretofore con stantly exposed to the raids of the Turkomans; and with regard to the occupation of the( 62 ) TT ,,, , -.r 11,.„ ;f rtp Russians were to evince a determination to take possession of SEUIB J ?--5&lt; f*“; 'i- 1 “’* k ' s — • '* remonstrance from the Persians if they are e „ , &lt;&lt; in the event of our being unable to prevent the occupation of the Akhal line of country there can he no question that when the Russians have accomplished that their next move will he the occupation of Merv, and with it their line ot communication between the Caucasus, the eastern shores of the Caspian, and the Oxus will have been completed. “ The advantages of this position to Russia will be that the line of communication from the Caucasus to Turkistan will pass from the Caspian eastwards, excepting Rom the Tiiien to the Moorghab streams, and from there to the Oxus through a xve 1-watered, and in some places an extraordinarily fertile country, accessible throughout to artillery and thoroughly salubrious, excepting for a short distance near the Tipn, and that it will afford them, having as it does on Persia a safe and secure line of frontiers. When established at Merv, their first care would be the construction of a Railway along this line in order to secure every advantage for their trade with Central India, and to establish rapid military communication with Turkistan • and if this project were carried out, Russia would be in a position at any time without affording room for open objection, under the pretext of military exigencies in Turkis- tan, to concentrate a force at Merv, which would threaten and distui d our Indian frontier, and hold the adjoining Provinces in a state of constant political feiment. « This, it appears to me, is what will happen if the Russians secure Merv and complete the circle of communication by that place between the Caspian and the Oxus; but if they can be kept out of Merv, their whole scheme will be deranged and broken through. Of the disadvantages which would accrue to England from this position of Russia at Merv, I only instance one, which is however of paramount importance. England being so brought face to face, it may be said, in the East with a Colossal European Military Power like Russia, the British force, which we maintain on the frontier of India, would cripple our resources, both in Europe and India, and more than embarrass us financially. “ From what I have stated above, it will be seen that Merv, in my opinion, is a strategical point of most vital importance to Russia, and to ourselves. Russia is fully cognizant of its value to her, and for a number of years from the time when she occupied Ashoorada, there has been ample evidence that its acquisition has been a principal point of her policy, and one which has been persistently kept in view by her. Whereas the importance and neces sity for our excluding Russia from it have not yet been generally recognized or admitted by us. The prestige of Russia would lose nothing if she advanced us further in the direc tion of Merv, while our prestige and interest would sustain a great shock if we failed to prevent its occupation by her. “The attainment of that object, not necessarily by direct occupation by ourselves, but by its possession by others in our interest, would appear to justify a considerable sacrifice on our part. “ The difficulty is to discover by what means this may be attained. “ Some authorities, civil and military, have maintained that our Indian Frontier will not be secure until Afghanistan, or some portions of Afghanistan, have been annexed by us. Sir Justin Sheil recommended our occupation of Candahar, and Sir Henry Rawlinson has strongly recommended our being in possession of Herat. While admitting the marked difference which exists in the character and disposition of the population of Candahar and Herat, compared to that of the turbulent tribes of Cabul and the mountainous portions of Afghanistan, and that the former have a natural tendency towards agriculture and trade which might render the acquisition or tenure of their country by us comparatively easy, I do not consider either of these projects at present practicable or expedient. But it seems to me that it might be advisable for the Government to take into consideration all that has been said, or may be said, for or against those plans; because if there be a prospect of their deciding in ravor of any such project, the present would appear to be the time for setting on foot the requisite measures, while there would still be a possibility of preventing the Russians from occupying Merv by our making that place a dependency of Herat. But assuming that the English Government will not decide upon taking any such action, then it should be considered whether Merv could not now be added to the Afghan be^efTfo^future (xinsi^'^t^ 6 S ^° U ^ ^' me ^ an d the question of its ultimate fate might understanding come to between Lord Clarendon and Prince Gortchakow, Merv inde lent e en exc uded from the Afghan territory and included in that belonging to W Rom E e 7 7 Urk0manS b.

But in a Minute, dated 30th Noyember 1841, that officer advocated the occupation of Herat, and summed up bis opinions thus: “ That by the occupation of Herat we acquire in reality, and in the opinion of Russia and all Centra] Asia, an immense political and military advantage; we tranquillize and secui-e, which we have not yet been able to do, Afghanistan and the neighbouring countries : we close the door against Russian interference; the question of Persian supremacy will be settled in the only way it can be settled without a war with that country, for she is unlikely to yield her pretensions unless to force ; and we rid ourselves of a restless, ambitious and bold enemy whom no professions or conciliations can bind; and if we happened to be at war with Russia, and at the same time in alliance with Persia, Herat is not so far removed from the Caspian as to prevent us from conducting warlike operations on that sea, and maintaining through it an offensive war against Russia in her Georgian provinces, and in the mountains of the Caucasus/^ The allusion to Sir Henry Bawlinson’s views probably refers to tbe follow ing passages in Chapters III and VI of “England and Russia in tbe East” :— “ So long as Khiva and Bokhara preserve their independence, there may not be occasion for any more active interference upon our part than a constant reference to Prince GortschakofPs circular, and a continued protest against the promotion and decoration of contumacious commanders who—in defiance of orders, as it is said, and to the manifest risk of the peaceful relations of the country—press forward from one conquest to another; but if to the final subjugation of Kokand is added an attempt to subvert the independence of the other Uzbeg States—if Russia should take possession of the Oxus, as she has already taken possession of the Jaxartes, then, as her outposts will be in contact with the Afghan outposts along the whole line of the mountains from Mymenah to Badakhshan, it will become a question for a serious consideration, whether, leaving Cabul and Ghazni, the scene of our old disasters, to struggle on in isolated anarchy, it may not be incumbent on us to secure a strong flanking position by the re-occupation of the open country of Shaul, of Candahar, and even of Herat. There is a strong impression abroad, amongst those best acquainted with the subject that ultimately—not perhaps in this generation, but whenever Russian Turkestan shall include the basin of the Oxus, and a Russian Governor-General shall be enthroned at Bokhara—it will be necessary, for the due protection of the Punjab and the North-West Provinces of India, that we should erect and hold first-class fortresses in advance of our present territorial border and on the most accessible line of attack ; and it is thus satisfactory to find that the positions of Herat and Caudahar, which precisely meet the military require ments of such an occasion, have been already pointed out by one of our most cautious diplo matists as the true political frontiers of India ;* while it has been also shown that these districts may be administered with comparative ease, since * See an excellent paper by Sir Just^ Hoorani population—the only element of danger in “Life in Pei^siif” PeDdlX t0 11611 S Afghan Government— is here outnumbered and neutralized by docile Hazarehs and pliant Parsiwans, who gratefully remember our former beneficent rule, and would gladly welcome its return. It is to be hoped that we shall not prematurely take alarm. At present there is no pressing danger, no cause for unusual precautions ; but the time may come when it will be our duty to remember that outworks are as necessary to the defence of empires as of fortresses, and that in this view Herat and Candahar are the Malakoff and Mamelon of our position in the East/’ ******** “ Taking it for granted, then, that we shall never wait to be attacked, in which case the troubles in our rear would probably be more serious than those in front, the next point to con sider is how and where we are to meet the enemy. At what point are we prepared to say to Russia— f Thus far shalt thou go and no further ?’ Along the northern limits of India and its dependencies Russia has herself drawn a line—the line of the Oxus—which she is bound not to transgress; but this limitation hardly meets the general question, since the road into India from Russia’s European base is not from the northward across the Hindukush to Cabul, but from the north-westward by Merv, Herat, and Candahar, and upon this line, which does not even approach the Oxus, there has been hitherto no understanding as to a finality of advance, nor perhaps is it advisable that there should be an understanding which would hamper England but leave Russia free. Without, therefore, making any offensive notification to Russia about the limitation of her advance, and reserving to ourselves the right, in the interests of the Afghans, to impede her occupation of Merv if it seems advisable, I submit that we should at any rate make up our own minds that she shall not follow up the Moorghab valley from Merv into the Afghan territory unopposed. In fact the facility of taking Herat by a ‘ coup-de-main’ from Merv is so patent, while the consequences of that movement to British India might be so fatal, that it seems a fair matter for consideration whether the Russian occupation of the one city should not be immediately followed by the British occupa tion of the other. Should the crisis be delayed for another year or two—and it seems only.a fair surmise that it will be so delayed—the clouds that now obscure the Cabul horizon will in all probability be blown away, and Sher Ali will then be the first to suggest the necessity of holding the £ key of India’ with a British garrison.”- ( 64 ) The incorporation with Afghanistan of Mery and the country held by the Merv-Turkomans is a project to which the Government of India has recently been favorably disposed. Its policy however pointed not to forcible annexation hut to a furtherance of the supposed wishes of the paities concerned. And, however desirable might be an alliance betw'een Afghanistan and the Turkomans, based on the consideration of receiving British aid in the event of Russian aggression, the present relations of the British Government with Afghanistan ren der any approach to the Ameer of Cabul an extremely delicate operation. With regard to the “ understanding ” of 1872 between Lord Clarendon and Prince Gortschakoff there can be no doubt that Merv was excluded from it. Por al- though at that time the Russian Government repudiated any intention to annex Merv, Mr. StremounkofF in admitting that Khoja Saleh might, without objection, be included with the Afghan frontier, added “ that great care will be required in tracing a line from thence to the south, as Merv and the country of the Turko mans were becoming commercially important.” The above papers were sent home to the Secretary of State with the fol lowing remarks from the Government of India : “ We continue to receive information of Russian activity and preparation at Charjoi and in the vicinity of Merv for some object at present undefined : we are also in possession of intelligence pointing to increased Russian intrigue in the States conterminous with our Western Frontier; but as our reports are derived from Native sources, and no means exist at present of verifying them, we think it desirable to defer submitting any observations on the subject until we are in a better position to express a definite opinion on it; more especially as our general views on the question submitted by Mr. Taylour Thomson to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs are already before Her Majesty’s Governme|it.

The other orm e ® rrnin e how far the alleged motive of punishing sive intention of his movements is ™ rat !°n which tends to throw doubt on the aggres- territory already. There are no docum whether Kizil Arvat is or is not in Russian professing to determine authoritatively the limit nffPT X' °, f Her Ma j est / s Government east of the southern half of the Gasman V V* t ie . frontie f of th e Russian Empire to the doubtedly to the west of Kizil Arvat- U + a ' ii° me d ^ s ^ n &amp; u ished geographers place it un- Arvat, but in the most recent edition of an English map ofadmitted authority, the frontier is so drawn as to include both Kizil Arvat and Kara Kala within the Russian dominions. It cannot, therefore, be denied that there exists a diversity of opinion on the position of this boundary, and General Lomakin may have assumed that view which was most favorable to his own country without, on that account, necessarily evincing- ulterior designs of aggression. “ The importance, however, of the interpretation which is to be placed on General Loma- khrs movements is materially diminished by the fact that, since the date of Your Excellency's letter, he has withdrawn from Kizil Arvat and returned to Krasnovodsk. It may be that he never contemplated anything more than a temporary occupation of that post, for the purpose of intimidating the predatory tribes ; or, it may be, that he was forced to abstain from carrying out the advance he had planned by the course of the campaign in Turkey. The questions, however, which are raised in Your Excellency's letter have a permanent importance which is not dependent upon the fate of this particular expedition, and must be carefully considered though the immediate cause of alarm has passed away. “ The object of your letter is to show what you conceive to be the necessary consequences of the advance to Kizil Arvat on the part of the Russians, unless they are promptly arrested, and to detail the steps which you propose for the purpose of obviating the evils you apprehend. You observe:— _ “ ' It is as certain as anything can be, that nothing short of immediate, resolute, and most decisive action on the part of Her Majesty's Government can now prevent the early incorpora tion within the permanent bounds of the Russian Empire, not only of Merv itself, but of the entire district which the Russian maps assign to Merv, extending nearly to the walls of Herat.' And again: “ ‘If Merv be occupied by Russian troops, while British agents are excluded from Western Afghanistan, the question of Russian or British supremacy in Afghanistan will be virtually decided. . . . The surrender of Afghanistan to undisputed Russian influence would, in our opinion, necessarily involve the abandonment of Peshawur, and the acceptance of the Indus as the limit of British territory towards the north-west of India. For, unless we are able to command the passes of it, our present mountain frontier would be not only indefensible, but dangerously provocative to attack. But the abandonment of our present frontier would be tantamount to the abandonment of the whole Empire, inasmuch as our possession of the rest of India could not possibly survive such a humiliation. “ The first part of the anticipations expressed in the above extracts is no longer applicable to the actual state of affairs, inasmuch as General Lomakin, by returning to the Caspian, has sacrificed whatever advantage the occupation of Kizil Arvat would have conferred upon him in undertaking an expedition against Merv. But this occupation may at any time be renewed ; and, if the view of Your Excellency in Council be correct, the Empire of England would in such case again be threatened with the formidable calamities you describe. It has been, there fore, incumbent upon Her Majesty's Government to weigh carefully the arguments by which your conclusions are supported, and to consider how far they can concur with you in believing the dangers involved in an occupation of Kizil Arvat, if it should again occur, to be of so serious a complexion as to involve the necessity of adopting active precautionary measures. “ In estimating the probability of an attack on Merv, it is necessary to distinguish care fully between the two modes by which such an enterprise may be carried out. It may be done by a coup demain, a rapid and uninterrupted march ending in a sudden attack; or it may be accomplished by a slow and gradual advance of the frontier line, each successively acquired zone of territory being made good, cleared of hostile tribes, and stored with magazines, before the next forward step is taken. “If I rightly understand Your Excellency's views, it is an operation of the former kind that you apprehend. You speak of Merv being accessible from Kizil Arvat by a broad, healthy, and well-watered valley, and you quote Captain Butler in support of the belief that ‘ an army in occupation would have abundant water communication either for attack or defence, large Commissariat supplies, and an immense supply of splendid horses,' and the distance between the two points being little short of six hundred miles, you are of opinion it e might be covered by a handy well-equipped force in eighty days.' “ I am informed that the experience of Captain Butler, as narrated by himself to Your Excellency, does not coincide with the testimony of any other travellers. His statements are certainly not given in sufficient detail to furnish a basis for military calculation. Colonel Macgregor’s remarks upon allegations of this kind, in his recent report upon the routes through Beloochistan, are probably not inapplicable to Captain Butler's story: c Travellers' reports on this subject are very misleading; if they are furnished with enough for their few followers, they do not hesitate to record the remark, ‘supplies abundant,' whereas I believe the fact to be that in all Beloochistan there are no supplies.' The accounts given by others would hardly justify the belief that water would be found along the whole of the route, especially that part of it which lies near to Merv. It has hitherto been believed that that place is an oasis, sur rounded on all sides e cept the south-east by a considerable extent of waterless desert. It is still more doubtful whether supplies for an army could be counted on throughout the march. The country has for centuries been in the hands of the Turkomans, who have not been in the habit of tolerating the existence of a free population of any race except their own, and are( 66 ) not sufficiently patient of a settled life to cultivate move than is absolutely required for thei, own wants. The existence of any stores of grain or other provision could not be safely assu m . ed unless it had been previously ascertained; and dependence on gram found in the field would be hazardous. Cattle and sheep would, of course, be removed at the first rumour of a R„ s . sian advance. It appears more probable that unless the army was so small as to be hardly a match for the Turkomans, it would be compelled to carry with it from its base the mass of its Commissariat supplies. “ The knowledge at onr command on the resources of this district are most imperfect, and more specific and detailed information would be of no little value. Such as they are, the facts available seem to Her Majesty’s Government to furnish no ground for apprehending a sudden movement of the kind you indicate. It would he an enterprise surrounded by dangers and difficulties scarcely precedented in war, undertaken for an object the advantage of which is difficult to discover. A military force separated from its base by so vast an extent of hostile country would be m too great danger itself to he an object of apprehension to neighbouring territories. From all that we know of the capacity of Russian troops and Generals to conduct an expedition in an enemy’s country, it appears improbable that so distant a point as Merv would he attacked until the intervening territory had been annexed. “ This last, which would be the alternative method of advance, undoubtedly might be pursued without any serious military or geographical difficulty, or indeed, without any impedi ment except the cost which it would involve. It is impossible to assume as a matter of certainty that such an enterprise will never be undertaken by Russia. The only security against the prosecution of it which we possess would be its extreme impolicy from a Russian point of view. It would involve long and costly preparations; for the hostility of the Turko man tribes, though it might be overcome, could not safely be disregarded; and the States of Persia and Afghanistan, if any independent force remained to them, would not be likely to acquiesce in an annexation of territory by which their own dominions would be seriously threatened. When acquired, the possession of Merv could only be maintained by operations scarcely inferior in magnitude to those which would be required for its capture. The capture would be of no utility unless it could be maintained at least for some years. During that time all military stores and munitions of war, at least, must be conveyed either 800 miles from Krasnovodsk, or across 150 miles of absolute desert from Charjui. It is extremely doubtful whether such a force as would be necessary for an enterprise of this character could obtain the hare necessaries of life at such a place as Merv for many months together. We have no inform ation in detail to inform us that it possesses at present more resources than are requisite for the frugal support of its actual population. Various writers give very different estimates of the number of that population; but it can hardly be taken as exceeding the force which would he necessary for the permanent military occupation of the place. If the inhabitants remained, the resources available would not suffice for twice the ordinary consumption. If the inhabitants fled, the existing cultivation would cease. The enormous cost which these requirements must involve wou d be repaid by no substantial gain. Merv would bring to Russia neither revenue, nor su qects, noi security, save as a basis for a further advance towards India, the permanent oceupa ron ot Merv would be a needless and wanton waste both of money and of military force; and there are very few persons who believe that an invasion of India is possible for Russia, or is contemplated by the boldest of Russian statesmen. &lt; ^? es ne cessarily follow because it would he highly impolitic for Russia to take flilf ri1‘V- • 01 1 e ^ no ^ taken.

Circumstances, upon which it is unnecessary to dwell, have for some years past encour aged the present Ameer to hold cheap the friendship of Great Britain, whether as counting it a support which he could command at pleasure, or as esteeming it of little value. Your Excel lency has wisely judged that influence over the Afghan Government was not to be secured by showing too much anxiety to regain it. You are fully sensible of the importance attached to this object by Her Majesty’s Government, and they place entire reliance on your judgment in the selection of the means by which it may most effectually be obtained. “ I have also more than once called the attention of Your Excellency’s Government to the great advantages which would result to the public service from a fuller and speedier knowledge of the course of events upon and beyond the frontiers of Afghanistan. In proportion as changes in Central Asia assume a form and tendency to awaken the interest and solicitude of the Indian Government, the importance of improving our means of information will be more strongly felt. The arrangements necessary for permanently securing this result are in the main so dependent upon the good will of the Cabul Government, that your success in this direction will in a great measure turn upon the issue of your more general dealings with the Amir. “ To what extent it may be in your power to cause the approaches to Merv from the West to be more carefully explored without his assistance I have no means of judging. But as you contemplate in the despatch under reply, a mission of officers among the Turkomans, at the same time that you recognize the present estrangement of the Government of Cabul, I may assume that you would see no insuperable difficulties in an undertaking of this kind. If this assumption be correct, the most convenient plan to adopt would probably be to despatch to Merv an intelligent officer, in company with a Veterinary Surgeon, with a commission to purchase horses for military purposes in India. Captain Napier, who is now in Persia, and has already shown much discretion and ability in his communications with the Turkoman tribes, might perhaps be advantageously employed on this duty, in the course of which he would be able to obtain information on many points which are at present matters of speculation. The journey would not be free from risk; but the possibility of an attack upon Merv has been, and will continue to be, so often the subject of discussion, and it enters so much as an element in ■the consideration of questions of Central Asian policy, that a precise knowledge of all the physical conditions upon which such an enterprise must depend, would be of high political importance. “ Should this sugggestion commend itself to Your Excellency, you have the authority of Her Majesty’s Government to communicate direct with Her Majesty’s Minister in Persia in regard to the instructions to be given to Captain Napier and the arrangements generally. It must, of course, be clearly understood that, apart from the purchase of horses, his journey has no other object than the acquisition of correct information, and that he must carefully abstain from committing Her Majesty’s Government to any obligations towards the Turkomans. “ I will reserve for another opportunity any observations which I may have to make on that portion of Your Excellency’s despatch which relates to Persia. Any action which it may be thought necessary to take in reference to the relations between Persia and Russia, especially upon the frontier of the Attrek, must manifestly be of a diplomatic, and not of military character. It will not, therefore, be requisite for me to convey to Tour Excellency any instruc tions upon that head, but I will communicate to you any measures which Her Majesty’s Gov ernment may determine to pursue through Her Majesty’s diplomatic representative at the Persian Court.” \_From Secy, of State, No. 68, dated Y&amp;th October 1877.] 47. Action taken by the Government of India upon the Secretary Of State’s orders. —It only remained for the Government of India to carry out the measures which this despatch sanctioned. The first instruction was that the possession of a friendly influence over the Ruler of Afghanistan—such an influence as legitimately belongs to a powerful hut pacific neighbour, should continue to be a cardinal object of the frontier policy of Government. The selection of the means by which this object might be obtained was left entirely to the judgment of the Government of India. The second instruction related to the Turkomans of Merv. The Govern ment of India had proposed to send British officers to Merv with authority, after ascertaining the position of affairs there, to afford to the Turkomans all the assistance in their power if the prospects of resistance seemed favourable. This proposal was not accepted by the Home Government. But they authorized the despatch to Merv of an intelligent officer in company with a veteri nary Surgeon with a commission to purchase horses for military purposes in India. The employment of Captain Napier on this duty was suggested, ‘ in( 68 ) the course of which he would he able to obtain information on many point, which are at present matters of speculation. But it was to be clearly under, stood that ‘ apart from the purchase of horses, his journey has no other object than the acquisition of correct information, and that he must carefully abstain from committing Her Majesty’s Government to any obligations towards the Turkomans.’ And authority was given to the Government of India to correspond direct with the British Minister at Teheran for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements. Tho Government of India therefore addressed Mr. Taylour Thompson as follows:— “ Her Majesty’s Government consider that great advantage would result to the public service from a fuller and speedier knowledge of the course of events beyond the frontiers of Afghanistan, and it is suggested that, if the approaches to Mervfrom the west could be carefully explored, much valuable information would be obtained. “ Your Excellency has probably good means of judging whether there are any insuperable objections to an undertaking of this kind. The plan which has. suggested itself to Her Majesty’s Government as most convenient is to despatch to Merv an intelligent officer, in com- pany with a Veterinary Surgeon, with a commission to purchase horses for military purposes in India. Should this proposal commend itself to Your Excellency, the Governor-General in Council would be glad if you would submit for his consideration any general or special instruc tions which should, in your opinion, be issued to the officers selected for this important duty. It is essential that one thing should be clearly understood, viz., that apart from the purchase of horses the mission has no other object than the acquisition of correct information, and that the officers composing it must carefully abstain from committing Her Majesty’s Government to any obligations towards the Turkomans. “ His Excellency in Council would leave it to you to determine the most suitable time for the despatch of the mission, and to make such arrangements for their journey as you may consider necessary. “The Governor-General in Council proposes to nominate for this duty Captain the Hon’ble G. Napier, who is now in Persia, and who has already shown much discretion and ability in his communications with the Turkoman tribes. A Veterinary Surgeon will be selected here after when His Excellency in Council is in receipt of your views as to the instructions to be given.” [To Secy, of State, No. 43, dated l^th Dec. 1877.] [To H.

This is an object to which Her Majesty's Government attach the highest importance, and they must reserve to themselves the most complete liberty of action under all future contingencies as to the measures which may, in their opinion, be necessary to secure it. They cannot but feel that such an event, for instance, as the occupation of Merv, which would bring the line of Russian territory into direct contact with Afghan territory, would arouse the susceptibilities of the Amir to the highest degree, and probably involve him in a common course of defensive action with the Turkoman tribes upon his border. . Under such circumstances, it is necessary to observe how difficult it might be for the Russian Government to maintain a policy of abstention in accordance with its present assurances, or how impossible it might be for Her Majesty's Government to exert any effectual control over the actions of the Amir without undertaking responsibilities which they would most reluctantly assume, and which would virtually involve the very result which both Governments desire to avert, viz., the contact of the two powers in Central Asia.' “I may further observe to Your Lordship that when, on the 15th November last, I mentioned to Punce Goitschakoff, a report then current of a projected Russian expedition to Merv, I was authorized by His Highness to inform Her Majesty's Government that there was no question of such an expedition nor any idea of occupying Merv. “ I am instructed by the Earl of Derby, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, again to invite the serious attention of the Imperial Government to the evil consequences which may arise from the movement of Russian troops now taking place on the Tuikoman Steppe, and to point out that the occupation of Merv by a Russian force will be held by the general opinion of the inhabitants of the neighbouring regions of Asia as announc ing a design on the part of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia to extend his influence, if not his dominions, into territories with which Her Majesty's Government have understood from the Government of His Imperial Majesty that it is not His Majesty's intention to interfere. “ Such an impression would impose on Her Majesty's Government the necessity of making a corresponding advance, in order to allay apprehension and remove misconception from the minds of the people of those countries. They could not, however, look upon so close an approximation of the outpost of the two Empires as in itself desirable or likely to facilitate the discharge of the difficult duties with which the administrations of each country are charged. “ With a view to the reciprocal interest of both countries, and to the maintenance of the good understanding now existing between them in regard to the affairs of Central Asia, I am instructed to state that Her Majesty's Government entertains a confident hope that His Majesty the Emperor of Russia will issue to his military commanders in those parts the strictest injunctions to abstain in the course of any operations which the misconduct of the Turkomans may render necessary, from advancing into the neighbourhood of Merv.' M. de Gier’s reply was addressed to Count Schouvaloff, the British Ambas sador at St. James, who by some oversight did not communicate it to Lord Derby. A copy of the reply was subsequently furnished to Lord A. Loftus. The following is its text:— “ J'ai 1'honneur de transmettre ci-joint k V. E. copie d'une note Sdressee par Lord A.

Mr. Churchill’s tour on the Caspian. — la February 1876 Mr. Thomson suggested that Mr. Churchill, Consul at Resht, should make a tour on the coast to examine the condition of Ashurada which it was said would probably soon be submerged. He said— “ There is great difficulty in obtaining from native sources trustworthy information of the proceedings of the Russians at Krasnovodsk, and if Mr. Churchill in making his tour of inspection of Persian ports in the Caspian could extend it as k far as Krasnovodsk, much valu able information would doubtless be obtained by him. But as he would necessarily be obliged to go there in one of the Russian steamers either from Bakoo direct, or from Ashurada along the coast, the sanction of the Russian Government from St. Petersburg to his doing so would appear to be requisite.^ The proposal was approved, and the following instructions were issued. Mr. Churchill was told that the Russian Government had no objection to his visiting, in a private capacity, their ports, Krasnovodsk included, and that his study of their commercial condition would be facilitated by the Russian authorities, but that he should be careful not to excite their suspicion or to give umbrage to the civil or military authorities. His attention was also particularly drawn to the following points. It had been reported on statements emanating from the Russian authorities that on more than one occasion the Island of Ashurada had been so much damaged by inundations as to render it a question whether it would not he necessary for the Russian Government to abandon that island before long as a naval station, and to transfer its depots to some other locality either on the peninsula of Allan Kali, or on the mainland near the embouchure of the River Gurgan. Information on this subject, accompanied with a sketch showing the ravages already caused by the sea on the island, and of any works which might have been constructed with a view to its future preservation, would be of much interest. It was also desirable that he should obtain as much information as possible regarding the proceedings of the Russians, and such overtures as might have been made by them to the Turkoman tribes professing allegiance to Persia, and likewise that he should acquire as much information as could he unostentatiously procured with respect to the coast lying north of the Gurgan ciiid. all tiic adjacent Turkoman country. L. J {Secret, August 1876, No. 82.] rJ r * Churcllill,s tour continued. —In accordance with these the'southera mist of p eSht - ^ l he 21st 0ctober 18 76&gt; and proceeded along reaching Astlrahl^nl 1 h Wards Masha d-i-Sar, Ashurada, and G«, November x dem ’ aud ret urning to Resht on the 16th November. Owing to the advanced state of the season, and the mouth of theVolga being frozen, he was unable to visit any of the ports north of Lenkoran. On those points to which his attention had been specially drawn Mr. Thomson wrote as follows :— “ First, as regards Ashurada Island. Mr. Churchill entirely confirms what has been stated ^ ^ in regard to the constant exposure of the Island of Ashurada to floods, and the naval* garrison being obliged to live on board their vessels stationed both at Ashurada and Gez in consequence; and, moreover, states that the tenantry have themselves been driven to the necessity of sending at times their families away from the island, in which no more than 50 houses are, it is said, in really a habitable condition at the present time. The island is but a third part inhabited, the remainder being so swampy as to render it not only uninhabitable but unfit for cultivation. The island maintains also a bad reputation for insalubrity, a third of the inhabitants including those on boardship being, at the most healthy season of the year, attacked with fever, from which very few escape in summer. It was rumoured that the Russians had an intention of abandoning the island. Mr. Churchill, however, could see no signs of this. On the contrary, Engineers had, he says, been consulted about protecting the station from periodical submersion by means of a raised stone parapet round the inhabited portion of the island, but the work was after all abandoned, as the cost (half million of roubles) was considered to be prohibitory. “ At the extremity of the Mian Kali Peninsula, at a distance of about two miles from the Ashurada Station, the Persian Government have constructed a redoubt, said to have cost 5,000 tomans. It has not yet been completed or mounted with guns, and it is believed was never intended for any other purpose than as a landmark. “ Mr. Churchill was unable to land at Ashurada, as the boat only stopped there to deliver and receive the mails, and, during this time, he took a rough sketch of the Station from its east and north aspects, which he forwards. “ Next, as regards the coast lying to the north of the Gurgan. Mr. Churchill reports that, from information he has received, no suitable place for a safe port is to be found anywhere between Krasnovodsk and Ashurada, the whole coast being a shallow sea-board exposed to every wind. He had heard of two places—one, eight fursakhs (=42 English miles) to the north of Chikisliar, called Harem, said to possess good anchorage, and another, midway between these two places where vessels could ride'at eight fathoms, but the information was entirely false. He found also that at Chekisliar itself there was no harbour of any kind, in fact that the place was uninhabited, it being resorted to by the Jafirbai Turkomans who inhabit the mouth of the Attrek. The Russians made a reconnaissance in the autumn of 1875 along the Attrek up to Chikisliar, where they encamped for some time and erected, on their encamping ground, a few ovens and huts which, on their departure, were immediately destroyed. The Attrek is narrow but deep, except at its mouth, where it is so shallow that even small boats find it difficult to pass the bar. “ A few miles to the north-west of the point at which the Attrek branches off into two distinct streams are situated the ruins of an ancient town called Meshed-i-Mesrian, possessing some historical interest. This town was at one time, apparently from the extent of its ruins, a place of considerable importance and very flourishing, but was destroyed, as is supposed, before the time of Chingiz Khan, and its water supply, which came from the Attrek by means of canalization, subsequently cut off by Nadir Shah, from which time it is reported as having been abandoned. The Russians in their last reconnaissance visited this place also, and it appears contemplate clearing out the old canal in view to the establishment of a military station there, but nothing has as yet been decided on this point. “ The country to the east of this town, in the valley of the Simbar and the Chandir, forms the pasture grounds of the Dez and Devejee divisions of the Yemoot Turkomans, who are now, it is stated, in open rebellion with the Persians. These parts of the country, from their proximity to the mountains, which vary in altitude from 8,000 to 10,000 feet as they approach the regions inhabited by the Akhal Tekke Turkomans, enjoy a healthy climate, and are stocked with every description of game. Not far from this part of the Attrek is Byat-i-Haji, which was also inspected by the Russians. There are no structures of any kind erected in this place. Arvat Kala was also visited by the Russians. It is inhabited, and is in the possession of the Akhal Tekke Turkomans, who have not yet acknowledged the suzerainty of the Emperor of Russia, but it is feared they will, through the force of circumstances, have to do so shortly, the Russian advanced guard being within eight fursakhs of the place, established there, it is said, with the object of menacing these Turkomans. “ Reverting, however, to the question as regards Ashurada, it is Mr. Churchill’s opinion that the spot at which the Russians are aiming to establish themselves, in case they are obliged at any time to abandon Ashurada, is at the mouth of the Gurgan; in fact, he says he has heard that some correspondence was exchanged with the Persian Government on the subject, and that the Shah firmly rejected the Russian Government’s proposals. If Russia is unable to succeed in getting the spot required, it is believed that the base of Russian operations in the country, inhabited by the Akhal Tekke Turkomans, must necessarily be at Krasnovodsk. It appears that the Chief of the Akhal Tekke Turkomans sent his son a few months ago to Teheran with presents for the Shah, consisting of female slaves and Turkoman horses, with( 72 ) the object of ascertaining what amount of support he could reckon upon at the hands of the Persian Government, in case of pressure being exercised upon him by the Russian authorities of Krasnovodsk. “ Mr. Churchill also touches on the state of the Asterahad province, and the trouble which the Governor has experienced from the Turkomans. While there has been nothing but pilla ?e plunder, misdeeds, and murder on the part of these lawless nomads, much want of nlanaffe. , ment has, he thinks, been evinced on the part of the Persian Government. He says that during his short stay at Asterabad the Governor had been attacked twice in his own camp, and that, although he has three regiments of as good troop under his command as Persia can for. nish, with a thousand horse, he is unable to protect, in an efficient manner, the lives of the villagers living near the plains which form the camping ground of these lawless people. “ Mr. Churchill says he was unable to see the Governor, he having made several excuses for not seeing him in his camp ; moreover, that his presence at Asterabad was not at all liked especially when it was given out that he was going to remain there as Consul. “ Mr. Churchill has also endeavoured to get some information in respect to the exact boundary of Persia in Asterabad, and is of opinion that, from the mouth of the Attrek to the point at which it branches off into the Menah and Simbar, there is no doubt as to the Attrek being the frontier, but beyond that, he says, nothing definite is ascertainable. The Persian Karperdez claimed for Persia the whole of the sandy waste up to the very gates of Khiva which, practically speaking, is considered by Mr. Churchill to be entirely out of the question' Karee Kala he thinks is undoubtedly Persian, but whether Arvat Kala, tenanted by the Akhai Tekke Turkomans, is dependent on Persia seems to him to be somewhat doubtful, especially as it is uncertain whether the Chief of that tribe acknowledges the suzerainty of' the Shah Further east, Fort Anno, near Deregez, was pointed out to him by the Russian Consul Mr Bakoulin, as the most advanced post of the Persians in that vicinity, all the fortified positions between Fort Anno and Arvat Kala being occupied by the Tekke Turkomans. ^ “ In conclusion, Mr. Churchill observes ' The impression I carried away with me from Asterabad was one that I deeply grieve to say is adverse to the Persian Government, for what- ever, may be the views of the Shah, towards his subjects in that part of his dominions the Persian Government is daily losing its credit for honesty of purpose. The Shah's bond fide subjects, no more than the Turkomans, can depend no longer on the governing class who sacrifice every consideration to their profit and enrichment. Both see the difference between the firm but just Government of Russia and the deceitful proceedings of the Persians, and both the d ;y w j ien Russ y y J1 e J tend her powerful hand to the province of Asterabad.

But these are not the only Ms, or passes, leading over that portion of the Brahmk range of mountains ; there are others, very steep and difficult, it is true, hut which Bellevv states are usually traveled by the natives in seven days. «In an extent indeed, of 60 miles or thereabouts, there are, including- the Bolan and Mula not less than eleven passes leading from the plains of Kachhi to the highlands of Sarawanand Jhalawan. To some of these—such, for instance, as the Mula and Gazak passes—there are several different entrances. The following tabulated list will give the names of these passes, with other information connected with them . Pass. 1. Bolan ... 2. Kahun-ka-rastah Where situate. Plain entrance near Dadar Is 12 miles north of Shuran, and near the sulphur mines. Remakes. Will be described in detail below. Roads from Bagh, in Kachhi, lead to this pass; it abounds in numerous strongholds, well calculated for sheltering marauding parties. The country beyond the plain entrance is very broken and intricate. 3. Gazak ... 4. Mekh-ka-rastah 5. Ladau (or Muaj) 6. Takari ... 7. Mula 8. Naghan Has three entrances: 1st, at Shuran; 2nd, at Mukhali, 13 miles S. M. from Shuran; and 3rd, Tang-i-Gazak, which fol lows the course of the Gazak river. Entrance from plains 12 miles north-west from Kotri (or Kotra.) Entrance from plains six miles west from Kotri. North of the Ladan pass, and is entered from Kotri. ... Has three entrances: 1st, at Per- chatta, near Kotri; 2nd, the Taphoi, leading from Jhal, nine miles south of Kotri; and 3rd, the Gatti, a very difficult road. ... Is the direct road from the village of Sunni, in Kachhi, to Khelat. Roads from Gandava lead into this pass. The path through a portion of the third entrance is so difficult as to need the assistance of ropes to get through it. After heavy rain, water suddenly rises to from 60 to 100 feet, carrying everything before it. Half-laden camels per form the journey to Khelat from Gajen (near the second entrance) in 14 days; from Shuran in 15 days. A very difficult pass, and so named on account of some wooden pegs fastened in the face of a precipitous ridge of rock, 30 feet high to assist the traveller in ascending and descending; is impracticable after rainfall. Ascent very difficult in parts and goes by Zehri, in Jhalawan. Half-laden camels perform the journey by this pass from Kotri to Khelat in 15 days ; kasids (foot travellers) in two and a half day. Is rarely travelled over, owing to the many difficulties presented. Half-laden camels per form the journey to Khelat in 12 days, kaskh in three days. This pass will be found fully described further on. 9. Bhore ... 10. Shadihar 11. Nurmak AUCIU. iea,us from Naushahra, in Kachhi, to Khelat. Is about 25 miles south of Jhal, in the Maghzi country. Is north of the sulphur mines near Sunni. Meets the road fram Sunni by the Naghau pass near Geytani, about 30 miles from Khelat. Very little is known of this pass, but it is said to be a very difficult one to get through. Little or nothing is known of this pass.Mr. Hughes proceeds to give the following accounts of the Bolan and Mula Passes:— “Bolan Pass .—Tlie Bolan Pass,from the low country of Kutch Gandava, commences at a spot said to be in lat. 29° 3' N., and long. 67° 40' E., about five miles north-west of the town of Dadar, the pass itself being a succession of narrow valleys between high ranges having a north-westerly course. Through it runs the Bolan river (or torrent), which rises at Sir-i-Bolan, one march from the western or upper mouth of the pass. From the entrance of the Bolan, about 250 yards wide, near Dadar, to the first halting-place, Khundilani, seven miles distant, the road runs through a valley about a third of a mile in width and enclosed by low hills of clay-capped sandstone; these are succeeded by limestone hills covered with loose pebbles and boulders, and again by ranges of conglomerate of great height. The Bolan stream, up the course of which the road ascends, is frequently crossed during this first march to Khundilani. After leaving this latter place for Kirta the next stage, 14 miles in distance, the pass rapidly narrows, the conglomerate cliffs, some 800 feet in height, closing in upon each other and leaving but a narrow passage, through which the Bolan river finds its way, at times filled with w T ater. It is this portion of the pass which Masson mentions as being the most dreaded by caravans. For three miles or so from this defile the road is very stony, but it afterwards opens out on a level valle} r , though the river has again to be frequently crossed and recrossed. Five miles from the defile the hills of conglomerate cease, and their place is taken by a range of limestone of about 1,000 feet in elevation. Here the route winds through a valley of about half a mile or more in width, in the middle of which runs the river, concealed by very high reeds and grass, after which the path emerges on a broad level valley, bounded by hills of nummulitic limestone. Here is situate the small village of Kirta, 1,200 feet in elevation, which has a fort and is inhabited by Biluchis, the river running under the base of the hills behind the town. Close by is Garm-Ab, or the warm spring, the source of one of the confluents of the Bolan stream. The next march from Kirta is the halting-place of Bibi-Nani, 1,095 feet in height, and nine miles from Kirta. It is a shrine of some repute, says Masson, and there are some curious legends extant regarding it. The road passes through two plains, and after entering a o-orge, emerges into the valley of Bibi-Nani. The rocks on either side are still found to be composed of nummulitic limestone, some being from 300 to 400 feet high, while the range bounding the valley to the westward cannot. Cook thinks, be less than from 1,000 to 1,500 feet in elevation. From here a mountain road leads by Rodbar to Khelat, via Baradi, Rodbar, Nurmak Takhi, and Kishan, distant 110 miles. “The next march from Bibi-Nani is to Ab-i-Gum (or the lost water), 14 miles, so called because the small stream near which it is situate occasionally loses itself in the shingly soil and ao-ain appears elsewhere. The road to this.place is over loose shingle and boulders, and is, as Cook remarks, extremely fatiguing. It is very gradual in ascent for the first four miles, but much steeper afterwards, the height of Ab-i-Gum above sea-level is about 2,600 feet. It was in g, low range bounding this valley on the right that Cook found in the clay a seam of coal much decomposed, and also some thick veins of gypsum. “The next stage from Ab-i-Gum is Sir-i-Bolan, six miles distant, and about 4,400 feet in altitude. The road 'to this point is north-easterly in direction, but the ascent, though gradual, is very considerable; the inclination being, it is said, one foot in twenty-five. Here the Bolan river has its source, little streams of pure water issuing from many fissures at the base of a mountain of about 1,000 feet in elevation. In the conglomerate hills near this place, Cook discovered some thin seams of coal strata dipping to the south. From the Sir-i-Bolan to the top of the pass at the Dasht-i-Bidaulat, the route takes a westerly course, and no water, for a distance of ten miles, is obtainable. It is in the last three miles of this march that the most dangerous portion of the pass is found. Here the road becomes narrow, until at last, by the approximation of the ranges on each side, it is only sufficiently wide to admit of three or four men riding abreast. The hills on either side, which are still of limestone, tower above to a o-reat height, and can only be ascended at either end. After a time the pass becomes wider and the lulls less precipitous, till at length it opens out into a narrow valley extending west ward at the end of which the path cross-cuts the crest of a hill about 80 or 90 feet high, and enters a broad plain called the “ Dasht-i-Bidaulat,” some 15 or 20 miles across from east to west and about the same in length from north to south. The elevation of the crest of the Bolan Pass is about 5,800 feet, the average ascent being ninety feet in the mile, and the total length from the entrance near Dadar, in the low country, is thus—to quote the words of Cook, from whose interesting report this description has been mainly taken— c about sixty miles in length passino* in a north-north-west direction through the great chain of the Brahuik moun tains ’ It is formed by a succession of valleys of various widths, the broadest being the valley of Kirta bounded by mountain ranges having a general north-north-west strike, and a height which oreatly varies m different parts, but which, perhaps, attains to its greatest in the moun tain near Bibi-Nani. The pass is constricted at two principal points—namely, immediately after leaving Khundilani, seven miles from the eastern entrance; and beyond Sir-i-Bolan, near its westerly'termination, where a few determined men might hold it against vast odds. &lt; The ascent is inconsiderable till Ab-i-Gum be reached, when it becomes more marked, and in the( 78 ) last 20 miles 2,800 feet have to be surmounted. Ihe temperature in the pass during-the month of May is very hig-h, as the atmosphere is then excessively dry, and no amelioration of the heat is experienced until the point where the greatest ascent commences is attained. -\ s regards supplies, water is abundant and good throughout the pass. Grass and bhusa are to be had only at Kirta, and a rank, coarse grass in the valley near Khundilani; wood is scarcely to he procured at all. The mountains are excessively bare, and, with the exception of the last few miles beyond the Sir-i-Bolan, where a few straggling trees are found, produce nothing that can be used as firewood/ “ From a military point of view the Bolan Pass is important, as artillery can be conveyed through it without any serious difficulty. In 1839 a Bengal column took six days to get up the pass, and its artillery, consisting of 8-inch mortars, 24-pounder howitzers, and 18-pounder guns, were safely carried through. There are, however, dangers to be apprehended at times from the Bolan torrent, which is subject to sudden floods, from one of which a Beno-al detach ment, in 1841, was lost with its baggage. The pass is unfortunately infested by the Muni and Khaka tribe of Biluchis, who live mostly by plundering the caravans proceeding from Khorasan to Sind, and this want of security to person and property prevents any b of the peaceably disposed tribes from settling in the valleys, where, it is believed, a fair amount of good soil and an admirable command of water would allow of large quantities of rice and other crops being cultivated with success. “ Mulct Pass .—The Mula (or Muloh), or, as it is also called, the Gandava Pass, is the other route through the Brahuik range by which access is gained from Kutch Gandava tothe table-land of Jhalawan. In the low country the entrance of this pass may be said to com- mence at a place called Pir Chatta, where there is a ziarat, or shrine, nine miles distant from the town of Kotri. The route thence to the next halting-place, Kuhau (1,250 feet in height and miles distant), leads at first through a long, narrow, and stony hollow, with hio-h hills on the right and a low conglomerate ridge on the left, and afterwards into a wide basm inthe hills, through which the Mula stream flows, when in water, over a broad boulder-strewn bed it is here that the noh lung,, or nine fords, are met with, and the stream has to be crossed that umber of times m transit. A very narrow and tortuous passage, or defile, has then to be tiaveised wflh perpendicular masses of rock on either side, the road being here completely u taatelt ' 8lCad , St \ an ,°‘ her l ,asin in thehills &gt; with some cultivation, and t0 Kuhau whwh is merely a halting-place in a glen, there being no village here or 3 w ' es obtainable, except cattle-forage, and this only in limited quantities. along u F pTe K e 0 ouree t0 of h t e J il Mfl 0f .

Twelve miles further on to the source of the Mula stream, and near the village of Angira, the top of the pass is reached at an elevation of 5,250 feet above sea-level. “ The Mula Pass is thus in all about 102 miles in length from its entrance in the low country to the source of the river, the average rise being about 45 feet in the mile. It is con sidered, on the whole, to be preferable, as a military pass, to the Bolan, the road being better, the ascent easier and more regular, and some supplies, at least, being obtainable in it. At the close of 1839, General Willshire’s force, after storming Khelat, returned to Sind by this route; but the guns brought down with it were only light field-pieces. Masson, who traversed this pass, remarks that, in a military point of view, the route, presenting a succession of open spaces, connected by narrow passages or defiles, is very defensible, at the same time affording convenient spots for encampment, an abundance of excellent water, fuel, and more or less forage. It is level throughout—the road either tracing the bed of the stream or lending near to its left bank. It is not only easy and safe, but may be travelled at all seasons, and is the only camel route through the hills intermediate between Sarawan and Jhalawan and Kutchee from the latitude of Shal (where the line of intercourse is by the route of the Bolan river) to Khozdar, from which a road leads into Middle Sind. Danger from predatory bands is not even to be apprehended, and in this respect alone it has an immense advantage over the Bolan Pass. ^ Bellew,who, as previously mentioned, passed in 1872 over but a portion of it leading to Khozdar, says that in a distance of about 50 miles, extending from Pir Chatta to Gaz, it presents a succession of basins, connected by narrow straits that are very crooked. The basins are those of Pir Chatta, Kuhau, Pani-wat, Jah, Hatachi, Fazzan, Pir Lakka, Hassnah, and Narr. Each of these is more or less cultivated, contains abundant water and fuel, but very little or no pasture, and limited camping surface. The rainy season is in July and August. During these months violent storms occur on the mountains, and the pass often becomes suddenly flooded by swift torrents that sweep all before them.” The present Ruler of Khelati-Baluchistan is Khodadad Khan, who succeeded his brother Nasir Khan in May 1857. The following table furnishes an account of his genealogy :— 54. Genealogical Table of the Khans of Khelat and imme diate family of the present Khan. KAMBAR KHAN. I Sambar. I Mahomed Khan.

Policy of the Government of India towards Khelat as laid down in the Resolution, dated 16th October 1875—Por an account of the previous dealings of the British Government with the Khan of Khelat I must refer to the several memoranda extant in the Foreign Depart ment, ending with a precis by Mr. Henvey, dated 11th March 1876. The present Chapter takes up the story in detail only from the beginning of 1876, hut the following Resolution, No. 2819P., dated 16th October 1875, forms a convenient starting point:— “ As the time is approaching when, under the instructions conveyed in the letter to the Punjab Government, No. 1460P., dated 14th May 1875, Captain Sandeman, Deputy Com missioner of Dehra Ghazi Khan, is to proceed into the Murri hills and endeavour to effect a settlement of some of the disputes which of late years have distracted the country, it is advisable to review the recent correspondence regarding Khelat and Murri affairs, so as to set forth clearly the policy of the Government and tire objects which Captain Sandeman should keep in view in his proceedings. “ 2. On the 3rd February 1871 a conference of high officials of the Punjab and Sind was held at Mittunkote, with the view of securing unanimity of * Resolution No. 2248P., dated 19th ac ^ ori i n the management of the Murri and Bugti tribes. October 18/1. accordance with the suggestions then made, it was determined*— (( \ s £' That the control of the relations of Government with those tribes should be placed in the hands of the Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier, and that the Deputy Com missioner of Dehra Ghazi Khan, in respect of the said tribes, should be placed under the Political Superintendent. « 2nd. That in addition to the sum that hud previously been paid to the Murri and Buo-ti tribes for service on the border of the Punjab, Rupees 32,040 should be annually paid for the entertainment of certain horsemen of those tribes with the view of maintaining 1 the tranquillity of the Sind as well as of the Punjab frontier f Paragraph 18, letter from Punjab, an q 0 f Khelatf territory. The amount thus sanctioned was dated 4th February 1871. ^ ^ over to the Chiefs in the name of the Khan, whose subsidy of Rupees 50,000 a year, which is paid to His Highness under the Treaty of 1854 on condition of his preventing all plundering or other outrage by his subjects within or near British territory, his protecting the transit of merchants, and permitting no exactions on traffic beyond a fixed duty, was not diminished. The payment of Rupees 32,040 was sanc tioned for one year only, on the understanding that the whole question would be taken up shortly and discussed in all its bearings. “ 3. This measure proved ineffectual. In October 1871 a rebellion broke out in Khelat. Merchants were plundered in the Bolan Pass. Disorder spread into Kutchee. The attitude of the Murris and Bugtis was uncertain, and the Murris of the Bolan made no effort to oppose the progress of the rebels through the Pass, while their brethren under the Tomaudar Guzzun Khan prepared to join the insurgent Brahui Sirdars in their inroads upon Kutchee. At last the Khan placed himself in the hands of the Commissioner in Sind, who mediated between the contending parties, and effected a settlement, one of the terms of which was that property plundered from kafilas during the disturbances should be given up to their owners. The Khan received a lakh of rupees from the British Government to assist him m meeting urgent demands on his resources. “4 Matters however, did not improve. In April 1872 the Brahui Minguls, instigated, as some ‘supposed, by the Khan, attacked the Miizzerani section of the Murri tribe to whom had been entrusted the protection of the Bolan Pass. Shere Dil Khan, head of the iluzze- ranis summoned the other Murris to his aid, and retaliated by plundering kafilas on their wav through the Pass. These proceedings produced a chronic state of discord on the border of the Khelat and Murri country: and the Murris made frequent raids on the low lands of Kutchi. The Khan attempted to evade his responsibility for recovering the bulk of the plundered property from the Muzzeranis. He was severely taken to task by Sir William Merewether, and informed that Government held him responsible under Treaty for the safety of traffic. . . “ 5 The subsequent conduct of His Highness was not such as to give confidence in this administration. He declined to look after the government of the country; would not send a governor to restore order in Lus Beyla; would not exert himself to procure compensation for*plundered merchants, and threw himself into the hands of favorites, who encouraged him in his dislike of his Minister Shahghassi Wulli Mahomed, and m opposition to the British Government, and this conduct was notwithstanding the warning he received from the Viceroy at a personal interview at Sukker in the autumn of 1872. “6. On the 31st March 1873 the Commissioner in Sind at last withdrew from Khelat territory the Political Agent who was accompanied by the ex-Minister. This action was( 82 ) approved by the Government of India, who directed that the Rhelat subsidy should be with- held, and the Khan informed that if disturbance occurred on the frontier, the British Government would be forced to take its own measuies foi picscrving 1 oidei. “7. In the winter of 1873 certain outrages were committed on British messengers in and near the Bolan Pass: nothing was done by the Khan to exact reparation. Numerous petty offences were committed by Khelat subjects on the border, and on the. 11th February 1874, 200 armed Brahuis entered British territory and carried off the families of certain of their slaves who had shortly before made their escape. “ 8. In the meantime little progress had. been made in carrying out the scheme of the Mittunkote Conference in regard to the Murri and Bugti tribes. It had been the inten tion of the Commissioner in Sind to subsidize Shere Dil Khan Muzzerani and the Chief of the Sarawans for the protection of the Bolan Pass, and to increase the service both of the Murris and Bugtis. The contumacy of the Murri Chieftain, Guzzun Khan, in declining to attend upon the Political Superintendent of Upper Sind at Jacobabad defeated this inten tion regarding the Murris : the failure of the Khan of Khelat to enter into the plan rendered abortive any attempt to make arrangements for securing the tranquillity of the Bolan: and the only part of the proposals of Sir William Merewether which was carried into effect was the payment of a small sum to the Bugtis whose behaviour had been good. “ 9. Before the irruption of the Brahuis into British territory took place, the Com missioner in Sind had sent to the Khan a grave remonstrance to which an unsatisfactory reply was received. Sir William Merewether thereupon recommended that an expedition should be sent to Khelat to exact reparation for the outrage upon British territory as well as for recent attacks on merchants proceeding through the province of Lus Beyla. He also proposed that the contumacy of the Murris should be punished by the stoppage of all payments for service whether from the Punjab or Sind and by a blockade, or, in the event of these measures failing, by a punitive expedition into the hills. “ 10. The Government of India did not consider that the condition of Khelat affairs although grave, was such as to justify hostilities against the Khan, or that it was desirable at once to proceed to extremities against the Murris. At the same time, the failure of the attempt to deal with the frontier tribes through the Khan made it necessary to revise the arrangements agreed upon at Mittunkote, and it was determined that a party of Sind and Punjab officers should visit the hills, explain to the tribes the desire of the British Government foi the .maintenance of peace and order, and, if possible, make arrangements with them with that object. . , -A 1 / Sir M dliam Merewether made a second representation on the subject. He con sidered that the people of Khelat were exhibiting a bad spirit, that disorder in Khelat was spreading, and that the Khan was showing still greater opposition to the interests of the British Government than before; he represented that the Murris persevered in their contumacy, and tiat the Murris and Bugtis combined had descended upon the plains, and carried off large numbers of Sind cattle.that were grazing beyond the line of British posts.

Although the Khan o£ Khelat has not complied with the demands of the British authorities for the restitution of plundered property, the action of his Wuzir has had a beneficial effect. “ 14. So far as regards the portion of the British frontier from the sea up to Jacobabad, the measures taken under the instructions of 5th January 1875 have been completely successful, and no such offences as those formerly complained of have since been reported. “ 15.' The second object which Government had in view, viz., the safe transit of the trade with Afghanistan, seemed to depend mainly on the possibility of securing the services of the Murris and other neighbouring tribes. As regards the Murris and Bugtis, it was decided that the dual system of management from the Punjab and Sind should cease; the conduct of the tribes was to be considered as a whole whether in reference to Sind or the Punjab; the Deputy Commissioner of Dehra Ghazi Khan was to be the medium of intercourse and com munication with the Murris and Bugtis in all their branches, but he was to be under the orders of the Commissioner in Sind. Captain Sandeman was to use all his influence with the view of effecting a settlement of intertribal quarrels, and the arrangements of Mittunkote were to be carried out in their entirety, subject to the modification prescribed regarding the duties and position of the Deputy Commissioner of Dehra Ghazi Khan; but it was added that the separate payments to the tribes on the Punjab side must be treated as part of the general arrangements, and that the submission of Guzzun Khan, his attendance at Jacobabad, and restoration of the booty received by him in 1872., must precede the re-opening of friendly rela tions with him. “16. The orders given by the Government of India received the full approval of Her Majesty's Government. “ 17. It is now necessary to examine how far they have succeeded in improving the con dition of affairs in Khelat and on the frontier. Captain Sandeman's communications with the Murris resulted in the submission of Guzzun Khan, who visited Jacobabad, paid his respects to the Political Superintendent, restored his share of the plunder obtained in the raid of 1872, and recovered from the tribesmen of Kahun as well as certain Sanganis and Bijeranis their portion of the booty. Captain Sandeman also succeeded in tracing and recovering the cattle stolen from British subjects and from the people of Sibi by the Murri and Bugti raiders. These results are not only creditable to Captain Sandeman, but give reason to hope that the arrangement by which the conduct of our relations with the frontier tribes has been entrusted to that officer will in time produce more substantial effects. “ 18. At the same time, although since the beginning of the present year no disturbance has occurred within the British frontier north of Jacobabad, and none of any importance near it the Murris have continued their raids in,. Kutchee, and there still remains the dispute between the Murris and the Government of Khelat, which is closely connected with long standing intertribal quarrels, and which has not been touched by the engagements concluded under Captain Sandeman’s auspices. “19. Captain Sandeman is of opinion that, under present complications in Khelat, which he believes to be, and which the Commissioner in Sind admits may possibly be, fomented by the Khan or his immediate officers, any attempt to prevent the Murris from raiding in Kutchee by giving them service in the manner proposed in the orders of 5th January 187o would prove ineffectual, and that such arrangements must be preceded by a meeting in Kutchee with the Chief of the tribes, at which an endeavour should be made by him to adjust the differences out of which the present troubles have arisen. To such a meeting the Commissioner in Sind is opposed, as he considers it would be unwarrantable, when political relations with the Khan have beei/suspended, to enter his country and hold council with his Chiefs as to the part he is taking in the disturbances going on in his own country. Sir William Merewether moreover is of opinion that for Captain Sandeman to have anything to say to political questions affecting the State of Khelat generally would be opposed to the spirit of his instructions, and must lead to serious complications; that the object of granting extra subsidy to the Murris was to induce them to abstain from raiding in Kutchee in the same way as they have been induced to keen quiet within their hills on the Punjab side; and that Captain Sandeman should confine hi m§ elf to endeavouring to effect this, and to preventing the Murris and Bugtis from raid ing their neighbours, either within or without British territory. “20. Under existing circumstances, His Excellency in Council entirely approves of Captain Sandeman having abstained from offering additional service to the Murris on condi tion of their committing no raids in Kutchee. His Excellency agrees with Captain Sandeman that there is little, if any, probability at present of such a measure proving successful. When His Excellency in Council included abstinence from raids in Kutchee among the conditions on which the Murris were to receive further service, he had every reason to believe that the only difficulties to be contended with arose from the weakness of the Khelat Government, dhe cise is materially altered when there is ground to suspect that the action or the Khelat Gov ernment may, to some extent at any rate, cause the troubles which it is our desire to settle. “21. The Governor-General in Council wishes to bring every influence which he can exert to bear in promoting peace and good order in Kutchee, as in other territories boidering( 84 ) on the British possessions. The condition of neighbouring countries greatly affects the prosperity of Her Maiesty’s subjects, and His Excellency m Council cannot be indifferent to the condi. tion of the'State of Khelat. But the duties and responsibilities of the Government of India in reference to raids committed by the nominal subjects or the Khan of Khelat upon their neighbours in Khelat or other foreign territory are essentially dilterent from their duties and responsibilities in the case of raids committed in British territory. His Excellency in Council does not consider that it would be right to terminate arrangements which have secured the peace of our own border, because our efforts to restore older in Kutchee ha\e not been successful. “ 22. The Governor-General in Council is accordingly pleased to modify the instructions contained in paragraphs 12 and 14 of letter No. 161., dated 5th January 1875, to the Commissioner in Sind. The existing system of service for the protection of the Punjab and Sind frontiers will be maintained, and this service, in so far as it affects both provinces, will be treated as one. If the tribes to whom service is given commit any outrages in British territory or on British subjects on the Sind frontier requiring the stoppage of their service on that side, the service of the offending tribes will aso be stopped on the Punjab side, and vice versa, besides any other measures of a severer kind which the Government of India may find it necessary to take by way of punishment. But those penalties will not necessarily be inflicted either on the Sind or the Punjab side upon the commission of raids or other offences in Kutchee or elsewhere out of British territory. “ 23. It remains then to consider what means shall be taken to restore peace in Kutchee and protect the transit of trade within the territories of the Khan of Khelat. “ 24. Irrespective of the general interest which the Government of India have in promoting the peace and prosperity of neighbouring countries, they have a special interest in Kutchee. The boundary between Kutchee and Sind runs through an open country, so that any serious disturbances in Kutchee may affect British territory very closely. The raids however, which have actually occurred in Kutchee, have not as yet been of a kind to endanger the general peace of the British districts in Sind; and as the posts of the Sind frontier force are in advanced positions beyond the frontier, there seems no reason to anticipate that outrages will be attempted to their rear. Should such outrages be attempted, they should be promptly and vigorously dealt with. The advanced outposts on the Sind border then may reasonably be expected to secure a fair degree of order in the southern portions of Kutchee over which their power of prompt action extends. Any armed aggression within the Kutchee territory thus commanded by the outposts may be forcibly suppressed by them. “ 25. Beyond the point to which the power of the force stationed in the outposts extends, His Excellency in Council declines to accept any direct responsibility for the protection of hie and property, though he will continue to exercise such influence in the interests of peace as he maybe able to command in those countries. While, on the one hand, the Khan of Khelat appears to be either unable or unwilling to enforce his authority in those districts, it is clear on the other hand that it is not the duty of the British Government to maintain peace and order in His Highness* territories. So far as the influence and good offices of trontier officers can be used to promote peace and good order, and settle disputes whether amon &amp; m n es or etween the tribes and the people of Sibi or the Government of the •i-f-p’ r. 1 &gt; S , 1 XCe onc J 1J j l Council desires that they shall be freely exercised; but therespon- the British Govnaanneiit ' 11 ° coun ^ l T ail&lt; ^ ^he maintenance of order does not devolve on imnerwLkn^^ the quarrels and disturbances which prevail are but the influence of Bvif 1 U 6r an&lt; ? ™ ore ex P^ c it information there is little prospect of Excenencv in Counc It successfu % applied to their settlement His Hills as earlv in flu . eie oie desires that Captain Sandeman shall proceed into the Murri can tsnectintlocff tn j SeaS0 ^ as l^cticable, in order (1) to procure all the information he and the Afo-lmns or P / b fl uair ^ s amon g the Murri and Bugti tribes, or between them the Afghans, or between them and the Brahuis; (2) to endeavour as far as he can to brino- about an amicable settlement of these ouarrels • .

It is the determination of the Government of India not to permit outrages to be perpetrated in British territory or upon British subjects with impunity; but at the same time His Excellency in Council desires again to inculcate upon the Commissioner in Sind the duty of dealing patiently and considerately with the tribes, and of avoiding harsh and precipitate action, which was impressed upon him in the 19th paragraph of Mr. Aitchison’s letter of the 5th of January last.” [Political A., November 1875, No. 278.] lentofli; a spills n ry closely, | uofalilfcj the Siodfri!. anticipate It icy sfioiiHljv r tlienijis »f Kutctefi i tk Kiitfe iiitkontjUt for the pt itkiiiW ne hand, II rity intkf (vemmentfoi ce andgoolii ettle dispate' lie Gove* rcised; tatfc er does lit kerfs* s 56. Failure of the Commissioner in Sind to carry out the policy of the Government of India. He is relieved of all responsibility for Khelat affairs.— The Resolution cited in the preceding paragraph modified in one respect the decision of the 5th January 1875 by distinguishing more clearly the duties and obligations of Government in respect to raids committed within or near the British frontier and raids committed by the nominal subjects of the Khan within the territories of Khelat. Briefly, it provided— “ First .—That we should afford complete protection to the lives and property of our own subjects, and suppress outrages within the Sind and Punjab frontiers by force if necessary. “ Second .—That while we may reasonably expect our troops stationed in the Sind outposts to afford some protection to life and property in Khelat territory immediately adjoining the Upper Sind Frontier as far as their power can reach, we should not accept responsibility for the protection of life and property in the territories of the Khan of Khelat. “ Third .—That our frontier officers should use their influence and good offices for the promotion of peace and order and for the settlement of disputes, whether among the tribes of Khelat or between the tribes and the people of Sibi or the Government of the Khan.” Acting upon the orders he had received Captain (now Major) Sandeman pene trated into the Murri Hills, and thence to Sihi and Dadur, and met with consider able success. He arranged a meeting between representatives of the Murri tribe and the Brahui Sirdars, prevailed upon them and Mulla Mahomed Raisani, the Sarawan Sirdar, to suspend their quarrels and their threatened action against the Khan, and finally opened up communication with His Highness himself in the hope of inducing him to co-operate in the adjustment of the intertribal differences which were believed to lie at the root of the disturbances in His Highness’ territory. It seemed to the Government of India that Captain Sande- man’s proceedings were in conformity with the letter and spirit of the instruc tions conveyed in the Resolution of Kith October 1875. Sir William Mere- wether, however, thought otherwise. On the 17th December he telegraphed that Captain Sandeman was stated to have visited Sihi and Dadur-and commu nicated with the Brahui Sirdars, that such proceedings were directly contrary to the Commissioner’s orders, objectionable, and embarrassing, and that Captain Sandeman had been ordered by express to return at once to his district. In reply, Sir W. Merewether was requested, while directing Captain Sandeman to avoid interference in the troubles apparently impending between the Khan and his subjects, to he careful not to interfere with Captain Sandeman’s execution of the orders he had received from the Government of India, and particularly not to be hasty in condemning Captain Sandeman’s conduct before he had explained it. It was added that Captain Sandeman’s movements among the Murris should not be interfered with. Sir William answered on the 22nd December that Captain Sandeman’s action was directly contrary to the policy laid down by the Government of India,( 80 ) in h a vin^ not only visited Sibi and Dadur and held communication with the Brahui sfrdars, but also in having sent messengers and letters to the Khan of Khelat, and in having entered the Bolan J^ass accompanied hy the Sirdars. Ih added that the whole of this action was directly contrary to the instructions which he had given to Captain Sandeman and finally exhorted the Covernment of India to keep Captain Sandeman to Dekra Ghazi Ivhan and his own legi. timate duties. Further correspondence showed that the Commissioner in Sind persisted in regarding Captain Sandeman’s efforts to adjust the quarrels between the tribes, the Brahui Sirdars, and the Khan as meddlesome and embarrassing inter’ ference in the politic.! 1 affairs of Khelat. He charged Captain Sandeman with disregarding instructions hy which the Commissioner had ordered him on no account to go beyond the hills into Sibi or Kutchee, or to have any communi cation direct with the Brahui Sirdars. But such instructions were opposed to the wishes and orders of the Government of India as explained in the Resolu tion of 16th October 1875, under which Captain Sandeman was deliberately invested by the Government of India with discretion to make any arrangements he considered advisable without the necessity of previous reference to the Com missioner in Sind. In brief, Sir W. Merewether’s dissatisfaction was due to a radical difference of opinion between himself and the Government of India. The latter were anxious that the Deputy Commissioner of Delira Ghazi Khan should use every effort with the Khan, the Brahui Sirdars, and the Murris, to settle existing disputes. The Commissioner, on the other hand, wished to maintain peace in Kutchee by force of arms, confine Captain Sande- man’s action to the Murri and Bugti Hills, and debar him from that com munication with the Government of Khelat, the people of Sibi, and the Brahuis which was contemplated by the instructions of the 6th October 1875, and which the Government of India considered indispensable for the purpose in view’. Matters having reached this stage two courses were open to the Govern ment of India. One to discountenance and recall the officer, who was actino 1 in accordance with their policy and who appeared to be deserving of their support, and to uphold the Commissioner in Sind from whose opinions on the subject of the action to be adopted in Khelat they had had frequent occasion to dissent. The other to place Captain Sandeman while entrusted with the conduct of these special duties under their direct orders and control. It appeared useless to attempt further discussion of the question of policy with the Com- missionei in Sind, who vcas already in full possession of the views entertained bv the Government ot India. It would have been inexpedient and even dangerous to have allowed the present complication to continue and to have endeavoured to work out a scheme of action by means of two agents at variance \vith one another, and one of whom had entirely misapprehended or ( isregaided the intentions of Government. While this matter was under con sideration the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab telegraphed on the 4th i a unary / i and suggested that it would strengthen Captain Sandeman’s lands and facilitate Ins task if he were placed in direct subordination to the tov tinmen 0 n in so far as the special duty entrusted to him was concerned. ilie Gommissiouei in Sind was, therefore, told bv telegram and letter dated f™ a !'5yhat lie appeared to have not properly understood or carried into seemed to ‘h 16th ° ctober i876 - tliat ^ restrictions which he n t ‘, Pf e( 011 Captain Sandeman’s movements were not in accord- m-nceedinoks ,.!

He was directed to exercise his own discretion as to his return to the Punjab, but not to protract his stay in Khelat territory. It was further ordered that his reports should henceforth be addressed to the Government of India and sent under'flying seal through the Commis sioner in Sind, and he was told that he would receive instructions direct from the Government of India during his present tour, proper steps being taken to keep the Commissioner in Sind regularly informed. But a further telegram* from the Commissioner in Sind showed clearly * Despatched on 9th January 1876, that Sir W. Merewether was still unable to accept No. 25 of Abstract of Contents. . the views of the Government of India and that he persisted in disapproving Captain Sandeman’s proceedings, notwithstanding the intimation conveyed to him that those proceedings were not inconsistent with Captain Sandeman’s instructions or in excess of the powers conferred upon him bv Government. The terms of Sir TVilliam’s telegram left no hope of receiving from him such full and hearty co-operation as was deemed to be indispensable for the furtherance of the efforts of Government to bring about a better condition of things in Khelat. The Government of India were not prepared to abandon the policy which had been deliberately adopted after personal consultation with Sir William Merewether and full consideration of the arguments urged by him, and they were therefore constrained to take the only alternative remain ing, and to act upon the instructions conveyed at the close of paragraph 4 of the Secretary of State’s despatch No. 91, dated 8th July 1875, and to remove from the conduct of affairs in Khelat the agent whose oj)inions had been found to be irreconcileable with their own. Accordingly, Sir William Merewether was relieved of all responsibility for Khelat affairs, which were henceforth to be conducted by Colonel Munro, Commissioner of the Derajat Division. Colonel Loch was also relieved of all similar responsibility except in so far ds his military duties were concerned. Both Sir William Merewether and Colonel Loch were to comply with all requi sitions iu respect both to military and police arrangements on the entire Sind and Khelat frontier which Colonel Munro might make on them. Colonel Munro was ordered to proceed at once to Jacobabad, and Captain Sandeman was to hold the same relation of subordination to Colonel Munro as he formerly did to the Commissioner in Sind, and to submit reports through Colonel Munro. [Political A., March 1876, Nos. 38-78.] 57. Major Sandeman’s report of his proceedings in the cold weather of 1875. Orders thereon of March 1876 sanc tioning a second Mission to Khelat in order to carry out the policy of the Resolution of October 1875. —In February 1876 Major Sandeman reported the results of his mission which are summarized in the orders of Government quoted below. After considering them the Government of India resolved to sanction a fresh attempt to carry out the objects of the Resolution of October 1875, and, under certain conditions, to re-establish friendly relations between the Khan and the British Government. The questions for decision were thus stated (Resolution No. 671P., dated 14th March 1876):—- “ First .—What action shall be taken by the Government in view of the state of affairs in Khelat reported by Major Sandeman, and subsequent events ? “ Secondly .—Are any further measures immediately necessary for efficiently conducting British relations with Khelat now that the Commissioner in Sind has been relieved from responsibility in reference to them ? Having cited the instructions conveved in the orders of October 1875 the Resolution proceeded :— “ Major Sandeman duly carried out the above instructions; proceeding from Hurrund on the Dehra Ghazi Khan Frontier on the 22nd November he entered the Murri Hills, andk ( 88 ) in the course of a Ion' tour through Kahan, Sibi, the Bolan -Pass, Quetta, Mastung, aj khelat had friendly conferences with the Chiefs of the Mum and Bug , tribes, the Brahui (Sarawan) Sirdars, the Afghan Chiefs of Sibi and Khujja , and ultimately with the Khan himself. “From his interesting report it appears that his mission was in one respect a failure; he did not succeed in settling the disputes between the Mums and Bngtis and thaBrahuis, or between them and the Khan; but nevertheless m the opinion of the Government of India, it was by no means wholly unsuccessful; it proved if it did nothing more, that the advent of a British officer as mediator was most welcome to the Chiefs of Khelat. By all parties with whom he came in contact, by Mums and Bugtis, by the Afghans of Sibi, by the Brahui Sirdars, by the Dumar Kakar Patan Chiefs, by the Mmguls of the Bolan Pass and by the Khan himself. Major Sandeman was received m a spirit of marked friendli- ness ^ and respect; indeed all seemed tending to a successful issue when a change appears to have taken place in the disposition of the Khan, which change Major Sandeman attributes to some doubts which arose as to his position and authority; but even after this he was still treated with consideration. The Khan himself, though he drew back from the promises of a reconciliation, e on the basis of hfasir Khan s settlement, made to the Biluch Sndars who proceeded in advance, still professed his readiness to comply with the directions of the British Government; at Major Sandemaids request he received the Brahui Sirdars in Durbar; expressed his willingness to forgive the past, and to abstain from hostilities against his Sirdars, pending the orders of the British Government, and eventually made Major Sandeman the bearer of a letter to His Excellency the Viceroy, couched in submissive terms, asking permis sion to offer an explanation of his conduct through Major Sandeman, or to attend at any place required, to offer it in person. “If the history of the mission had ended here, there would indeed have been little doubt as to the course to be pursued; for as the British Government had, by the deputation of Major Sandeman, expressed its willingness that the influence and good offices of its frontier officers should be used for promoting good order and for the settlement of disputes in Khelat, and as the officer deputed had been received in a most friendly manner by all parties interested, it would have been only in accordance with past orders to allow Major Sandeman to complete the work which had been commenced with promise of success but had been interrupted by circumstances; but unfortunately during the stay of the mission in Khelat territory tw T o events occurred which seemed likely to place difficulty in the way of effective mediation. “ In the first place, on the very day after the Durbar in which the Khan had declared fora suspension of hostilities pending the decision of the British Government, his Naib in Kutchee (acting, as the Khan afterwards admitted, under his own orders) opened lire upon some Brahui followers of the Sirdars, killed several, and carried off some head of sheep and goats. The occurrence was announced by the Khan himself, who explained that it was in punishment for an attempt to plunder. Major Sandeman was justly aggrieved at the Khan’s conduct; but as the leading Brahui Chief did not attach, apparently, much importance to what had taken place, it need not probably be regarded as a serious obstacle to reconciliation. The second and most serious occurrence was that Nurdin, the Mingul Chief, was killed by the Khan’s troops a few days after Major Sandeman hud left Khelat. The Chief had arrived at Khelat some time before Major Sandeman, and his advent ivas in no way connected with that officer s visit his death, therefore, was not in violation of the pledge of ^ e V gl ven ^7 tfi e Khan to the Chiefs accompanying Major Sandeman, and the honor of the British Government is not concerned in the matter. The Khan, indeed, who was the first to m orm . ajoi andeman of the event, explained that in causing the death of the Sirdar be simp y anticipated an attempt to be made on his own life; as the Chief is said to have been an unscrupulous intriguer, and as Sir Willliam Merewether has reported that he was at the time engaged in a conspiracy to dethrone the Khan, it is possible, indeed not improbable, that the Khan s story is correct. r &gt; 1 “ However this may be, the occurrence had an unfortunate effect, and made it necessary or ie overnmen o ndia to pause for a time and watch the progress of events before it e Q hF co ' tmuance , of a Po^ey of mediation; from Colonel Munro’s telegram of in iruo emary 1 a PP eaie( l that the Brahui Sirdars (Sarawans), having lost all confidence Talawan*? in Gpw f COnSeC ^ Uei ?

The services of the Mounted 1 dice maintained in Sind Districts under the designation of. Biluch Guides were made available to the officer in charge of political relations with Khelat. And, inasmuch as it appeared to be necessary for the effective political management .of the Khelat border that the portion of TJpper Sind, known as the Frontier District, should be placed under the administrative control of the Punjab Government, it was intimated that an application would he made to the Secietaiy of State to enable the requisite Proclamation to issue under the provisions of 28 Viet., c. 17. It may be mentioned here that the Secretary of State withheld his sanction and that the transfer both of the Sind Frontier District and of the Province of Sind to the Punjab has merged in the larger question of reorganizing the administra- tion of the entire frontier from Peshawur to the sea which is still under consideration. Colonel Munro was instructed by telegram in accordance with these orders. The officers who had accompanied Major Sandeman were thanked, khilluts were bestowed on several Biluch Chiefs, and on the 4th April Maj Sandeman started for the Bolan Pass.

Information sent to the Amir of Cabul of the proceed ings of the British Government in Khelat. Remarks made by the Sadr-i-Azim (Syud Nnr Mahomed).— Before pursuing further the account of Major Sandeman’s second mission, it will be convenient to men tion the steps taken by the Government of India to communicate the state of Khelat affairs to the Amir of Cabul. The Punjab Government were furnished with a copy of the orders cited in the preceding paragraph and were desired to communicate their substance to the British Agent at Cabul. The object which Government held in view, viz., the pacification of Biluchistan, was also to he explained so as to enable him to acquaint the Amir with the par ticulars of the case in the event of His Highness seeking for information. The Commissioner of Peshawur accordingly addressed the British Agent as fol lows :— i tie object or the brovernment of India with reference to Khelat affairs as explaii by them in the month of October last, and in accordance with which Major Sandeman \ deputed to the Murri hills, was to use the influence and good offices of Frontier offic to piomote peace and good order, and to settle disputes whether among the tribes etween the tubes and the people of Sibi or the Khan of Khelat, although 'the responsibil or t ic goo government of the country and the maintenance of peace and order did i i« 7 ~ n vi i i 81 Governraent - Major Sandeman was sent to the Murri hills in Novem lH7o with the object of obtaining all possible information as regards local feuds and quari among the Mum and Hugh tubes, between them and the Afghans, or between them &gt; u. . .aims, to en eavour as far as. possible to settle these quarrels himself; to report, ,ie m oima ion o aovernment, his views of such as he was unable to settle, and to furn Toveinmen wi . a m ther report on the relations between the Murri and Bugti tribes, £ a ween mm an ie . an.

On the 28th April the receipt by the Amir of a letter from Sultan Mahomed Khan, Superintendent of Cus toms at Kandahar, furnishing intelligence of Major Sandeman’s movement and intentions gave the British Agent an opportunity to communicate the contents of the letter he had received from the Commissioner of Peshawur. The Sadr-i-Azim (Syud Nur Mahomed) then observed : — “We, the Durbar authorities, are surprised (to find) that while the British Government aimed at the security of (the Khelat road) the road has become unsafe on account of Major bandeman’s arrival, and the lo'S caused by traders has been more (than before) and Nurdin has been killed, while (on the contrary) in the long past period no injury happened to kafilas on that road. If the object of the British Government has been to settle the disputes existing between the Biluch tribe, Mulla Muhammad (Khan) and Nurdin Khan and other Biluches owing to their relations with this (lit., on the ground of their rights) Government, waited, on this Durbar formerly and submitted a petition for redress, and through respect to friendly relations existing between the Governments {i.e., Afghan and British), the original petition was made over to you for submission to British Government, but no reply has yet been received. Besides this, such advance (lit., so much perseverance, isrdr) on the part of the British Government undoubtedly leads to apprehension and discouragement of the people of Afghanistan (lit., of God). The Punjab Government drew attention to the reference to Mulla Maho med’s petition sent on by the Ameer, and which, it was said, had never been answered. They were referred in reply to Foreign Department Resolution No. 2248, dated 19th October 1871, “ in which it was stated that after the lapse of time which had occurred, His Excellency in Council considered it unnecessary to make any communication to the Ameer regarding the petition.” [Political A., March 1877, Nos. 243 and Nos. 260-266.] 59. Narrative of Major Sandeman’s proceedings in the Summer of 1876. Outbreak of cholera.—To return to Major San- deman. Having been furnished by Colonel Munro with instructions based upon the Resolution of the 14th March, and with letters for the Khan from Lord Northbrook and the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, he arrived at Bagh on the 7th April, and was favourably received by the Khan’s officers. On the 10th April, on leaving Bagh, a brief but fatal outbreak of cholera occurred. A forced march was made to Haji-ka-Shahr, and thence to Pir at the entrance of the Pass. Here the cholera increased and a further move was made to Kirta in the Pass, where considerable improvement took place. By the 20th the dis ease had disappeared. In the camp, including the troops and followers num bering 1,900, there were 140 seizures and 69 deaths. In the caravan, number ing some 6,000 souls, there were, strange to say, only 50 fatal cases. The circum stances were very trying, fully entitling the officers concerned to the recogni tion bestowed on their conduct by the Government of India. A most satisfactory feature in this deplorable outbreak was the cordial and effective aid rendered by the Beluch and Brahui Chiefs. Under the orders of Sirdars Mulla Mahomed Raisani, Shadi Khan Bangulzai, Yar Mahomed Kurd, and others they took charge of the caravans, numbering 4,318 camels, 520 donkeys, and valued at upwards of 5 lakhs of rupees, and escorted them through the Pass to Quetta.

Preliminary report by Major Sandeman of his negotiations with the Khan and his Sirdars. —On the 14th June Major Sandeman submitted a report of his pro ceedings from the time of his arrival at Kirta on the 14th April to date. There( 92 ) had been some difficulty in arranging a place of meeting with the Khan. The latter wished Major Sandeman to come to Khelat, xMajor Sandeman on the other hand wished the Khan to come to Mustung. The question was not decided when Major Sandeman resolved to depute Captain Wylie accompanied by Dr. D uke and an escort of the 4th Punjab Cavalry under command of Captain Shepherd to convey Lord Northbrook’s letter to the Khan. The party started on the 2nd of Mav 1876 and was received with all honor by the Khan who entrusted Captain Wylie*with replies for His Excellency the Viceroy, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and Major Sandeman. In the last letter the Khan while agree- in (T&gt; to do anything that was required ot him, piefened complaints which appeared reasonable to Major Sandeman. Ihe ciicumstances aie best related in Major Sandeman’s own words. He wrote :— «When sending off Captain Wylie with His Excellency the Viceroy and the Hon’ble the Lieutenant-Governor's letters, 1 directed Sirdars Imam Buksh Khan, Mazari, and Jamal Khan, Lagari, to accompany him. My instructions to them were merely to watch events and to give me a true and reliable account of the state of affairs in Khelat. “ These two Sirdars on their return asked me for a private interview. To this I at once admitted them. They said that the Khan's state was as follows : That His Highness had called them into his Durbar and had held a private interview with them ; that his mind was distracted hy doubts and fears; that His Highness (they asked to be excused for repeating this, as perhaps it showed disrespect) said that from the commencement of his reign he had ever taken advice, that it was through taking the advice of the British officers that his affairs with the Sirdars were now so complicated; that at Sir William Merewether's request he had occupied Beyla, and in fact that officer had made him a present of the province of Lus; that he had gone to great expense to secure the safety of the province and had put the traitorous Nurdin there as Naib; that at first he got real help from the Commissioner, who had im prisoned his enemy Mir Khan and his son Jam Ali; that shortly after this his Shahgassie, Wali Mahomed (a nominee of our own), had picked a quarrel with him (the details are too long to tell) ; that this quarrel had been taken up by Major Harrison and Sir William Merewether, who supported the Shahgassie, who was taken away from his Court by Major Harrison; that prior to this a greater indignity had been put on him by the imprisonment, at the Shahgassie's request, of his Senior Military Commandant, Shakar Khan, and two trusted Munshis, Gul Mahomed and Saleh Mahomed; that he had gone to Sukkur to meet the Governor-General, but as he could not talk English, he could not explain all he had to say and had returned to Khelat hopeless; that he met the Commissioner in Cutchi, but he would not listen to any request he had to make. After this the Political Agent had left him, and Jam Ah and Mir Ibrahim Khan had escaped from Hyderabad at a time when his affairs were very desperate; that Sirdar Nurdin (the brother of Ibrahim and uncle of Jam Ali) had at once rejoined them ; that they had bribed over the Beyla troops and seized the revenue, and were thieving goats and sheep up to the walls of Khelat; that he could prove, if necessary, that the occupation of Lus in the first instance was the result of the advice he received. Another point was that in the settlement made by the Commissioner in 1872 it had Ken decreed that tie Brahui Sirdars were to pay for the plunder of the kafilas in the Bolan, and had also to reimburse the ryots for their losses accruing from the rebellion of that year; that neither of the conditions had been fulfilled, and he had to pay for the kafilas Rupees 90,000 out of his own treasury; that his treasury was empty, and he felt very hopeless, but that if I would guarantee him fair treatment and terms based on the peace of 1872, he would come to Mustung at once. . i ajor Sandeman s answer, which the Sirdars had agreed to take ba( was )a le would submit to the Government of India any reasonable views a icques s w nc i t e Khan had to advance, but that he could make no prorah ti ar rv. m ’ + 16 ^ 1 . r( ^ ars smarted for Khelat next day, and two days afterwan i J 3 W1 ° !i Sa &gt;3 ^ ie wou ^ shortly leave Khelat for Mustung wh( Mnin 11 ^ eC i ° n 1G - ^^TT^y. ^-^ er the usual formal receptions were o\ Imom S B n v e b 1 F T l V1Slted ^ 1I T S Hi S hness at th e Miri (palace) attended by SiM an a v d Jamal Khan - With the Khan were present 1 AhriuB at al advisers “'^ awab Mahomed Khan, Mustaufi Fakir Mahomed, a Abdulla Jan, a merchant and friend of the Khan. x past events in the course of which t he had been direeto f ^ 0ut ^ us Beyla.

Memorandum showing the basis upon which the Khan was ready to make terms with his Sirdars. Major Sandeman’s remarks thereon.— 'The delegates accordingly met the next day at Major Sandeman’s camp and prepared a paper of terms of peace which was referred to the Khan. The latter took some time to consider its contents, hut eventually called on Major Sandeman and presented the paper* extracted below to the terms of which he willingly agreed. Once conditions were arranged between him and his Sirdars, he would use his utmost endeavours to prevent their being broken. * Appendix J. of Major Sandeman’s Report. “ Translation of a memorandum drawn up by His Highness the Khan of Khelat regarding the settlement of his quarrel with his Sirdars and presented by him to Majob R. Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner, on Special Duty, in Durbar on the 6th June 1876. “ Arrangements should be made by the British Government to compensate the Candahar merchants whose kafilas were plundered in the There is a correspondence with me regarding tins. nr n m i • j tr i t&gt; i ru t i Government has agreed to pay at least a portion of Mulla, Takan and Kazak Passes by the Jalawans this money under the agreement of 1872. who also realised transit dues from some of-these (Sd.)

This country should be made over to me or annexed to British India, or I should receive from the British the expenses incurred in the war against the J am. If none of these proposals are adopted, then the next best thing to do is to release Jam Mir Khan, now in confinement in British territory, but this should be conditional on his ceasing to wage war on me and causing injury to my country. He should be required to render the same alle giance to my Government as he did to the Governments of former Khans of Khelat, and I on my part will engage not to encroach on his rights and privileges. * This order cannot be found, but Sir William Merewetber’s report No. , para. , shows that some such order was issued. (Sd.) R. Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner. “ The Brahui Sirdars should be required to expel from the country my Ex-Wazir Atta Muhammad, who' treacherously escaped from Khelat notwithstanding my servant Nawab Muhammad Khan was security for him. The Ex-Wazir is doing all he can to keep up dis turbances throughout the length and breadth of the land. After a permanent peace has been arranged on the condition that the Ex-Wazir leaves the Khelat State, I will allow his family (who are in Khelat) to go with him. “ By the settlement come to in 1872 by Sir William Merewether it was decreed that the Sarawan Brahuis should pay compensation for the kafila they plundered in the Bolan Pass. This compensation they could not pay. I had to give Rupees 35,000 to the merchants. I had also to pay Rupees 55,000 to the merchants that were plundered by the Murris. I had thus a total sum of Rupees 90,000 to pay merchants on account of kafilas plundered by the Brahuis. It was decreed that they should pay, but as they had not the means I had to do so. I received after the settlement a lakh of rupees from the Government for my own use, but by this means I only received Rupees 10,000. This was not what the British Government intended. I therefore desire that the money should he refunded to me. “The annual subsidy of Rupees 50,000 which I used to receive has now for three years ceased but I do not feel I have committed any fault to have caused this. Formerly the Khelat Government used to levy transit fees at one rupee per maund. The British Government reduced this to eight annas per maund and the Rupees 50,000 was given as compensation. “My Commandant, Shakar Khan, and my Munshis, Mulla Saleh Muhammad and Gul Muhammad, were taken from me and put in prison by the British Government without their having committed any fault. I shall feel obliged by the British Government releasing them and allowing them to depart in peace. “ I desire to appoint Nawab Muhammad Khan, who is a well-wisher of my Government, to attend on Major Sandeman as my Agent. “ I desire that the share of the transit fees to which the Brahuis are entitled by ancient usao-e shall be continued to them as decreed by Sir William Merewether. “ Whatever terms of peace the British Government desire to give the Brahuis on the part of my Government that I will agree to. I will not violate terms. Let the past be forgotten I will restore to the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars their ancestral lands; and should th’ev at any future time violate the conditions of peace, before punishing them I will report what has occurred to the British Government through the Political Agent at Khelat, and after receiving sanction (from British) I will then punish the offenders. On the other hand should my Naibs and officers cause them injury contrary to custom and ancient usage, and should I not on being referred to do justice, then I am willing that my case should be appealed through the Political Officer at Khelat to the British Government for orders.( 94 ) “ The Brahuis should, according to precedent and old rule, serve me and obey my orders and I on my part will confer favors on them, as my ancestors did. « Should the British Government approve of these desires of mine as recorded herein, then my Government will hold itself responsible for the safety of the Bolan, Hulk, Raj, Kedj, Mekran and all other Khorassan Passes, and I will do my best to keep these Passes open, as desired by the British Government. The only portion of Major Sanderaan’s preliminary report which it i s necessary to quote here are the following observations on the above Memo randum :—He wrote, ' f Proposition No. 1 asks the Government to settle about the plunder taken from the f Major Sandeman is addressing the Commissioner kafilas in the Mulla pass. there are papers with of the Derajat not the Government of India. me ending with your 'f No. 144, dated 11th April 1876, showing that Government has already agreed to pay a portion of the money due. This portion is due for the kafilas of 1872. The whole sum I believe is not a large one. I would therefore solicit permission to enquire carefully into the total amount due to the merchants, and this done, the bills should be audited by you and paid to the merchants. My reasons for holding this opinion are as follows :— “If the correspondence of 1872 is examined, there is clear and substantial proof to show that the mediation then effected did not for the reasons then given include the Jalawan Sirdars. In fact, the Commissioner’s report No. 340, dated 5th April 1872, shows that they were pur- posely excluded from it. At that time Mir Khan, Jam of Bey la, his son Jam Ali, and Mir Ibrahim Khan were in confinement by our order. The Government of India approved of the exclusion of Sirdar Nurdin from the mediation, provided the Commissioner was assured that His Highness the Khan had the power to coerce him. “ But how did it all end? The Khan was not able to keep order in Lus Beyla or along that frontier. For these and other reasons he fell under the displeasure of the British and our relations with him ceased, and our authorities recommended an army should he sent to depose him. In 1874 his enemies, Jam Ali and Mir Ibrahim Khan, escaped from Hyderabad, and were at once joined by Nurdin (uncle of the former and brother of the latter)/who had been appointed by the Khan Naib of the province of Lus. Atone stroke therefore, so to speak, the Khan lost his dearly-acquired new acquisition. Moreover, I am of opinion that a perusal of the correspondence detailing these events will leave no manner of doubt on the mind that the Khan was acting throughout according to instructions he received from the British authorities. I do not intend to quote from the old records in support of this, as it would lengthen this letter very much to do so; but a perusal of these and His Highness’ own letters written to the British authorities at the time show that he is entitled in my opinion to the fullest and most careful consideration being given to all that then occurred to enable a just view to be taken of His Highness’ position and the true state of his affairs at the present time. 1 may, however, here again and that I believe the kafila money claimed in addition to what the Government has already agreed to give is only a few thousand rupees. The money might be taken irorn any sum the Government felt inclined to present to His Highness under the pro- V u S1 °tj S foreign Secretary s letter No. 8C.P., dated Delhi, 11th January 1872, paragraph 4, i (° U i | JGSe St , cons Hered applicable to the present position of affairs. That they are so I feel there ought to be no doubt, as the settlement come to in 1872, to use the Khan’s owu ° ne v that COuld uot stand ; nor could the Sirdars or their children’s children’ have fulfilled its conditions. that this was truly so will be found from a reference to the Commissioner’s decree given m paragraph 23 of his report No. 340, dated 5th April 1872, to the address of the on ole the Governor of Bombay. Therein it was directed that the Brahuis should give up i e r^J ?

That this was the old policy maintained in the days of Mr. Mansfield, Commissioner in Sind, will, I think, be gathered from a perusal of his No. 617, dated 2:5th June 1865, to the address of the Political Superin tendent. The other requests contained in the Khan's memorandum on which the basis of a peimanent peace as proposed by him should be made do not seem to require further comment by me.' ******** [Political A., March 1877, Nos. 356 and 365.] 62. Khureeta from the Khan to the Viceroy, dated 10th May 1876. With this preliminary report Major Sandeman forwarded the Khan’s reply to Lord Northbrook’s letter delivered to him by Captain Wylie. It is important as explaining His Highness’ view of the situation and ran as follows:— “I beg to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's kind letter informing me of your welfare. It reached me at a very happy moment, and 1 have made myself fully acquainted with its contents. I cannot express in sufficiently strong terms how greatly 1 am indebted to Your Excellency for your kind intentions towards me. “ In reference to what Your Excellency writes, viz., that the breach of friendly relations between the Khelat and British Governments which has now unfortunately existed during the past three years, is entirely my own fault; in reply, I beg to assure Your Excellency that I am your subject, and have ever attended to all orders issued, and have ever remained in sub jection to the British Government. Believe me that the unfortunate breach of friendly rela tions which has taken place is not due to me but to the following cause. “ Formerly officers of the Bombay Presidency conducted my relations with the British Government, who felt, kindly towards me and treated me with consideration. Mv affairs consequently prospered until the date of Captain Harrison's arrival as British Agent at mv Court. He was high in favor with Sir William Merewether, Commissioner in Sind, who was entirely led by Captain Harrison. “ After Captain Harrison's arrival at Khelat, Wali Muhammad (who is an hereditary slave) was my Wazir. He became at enmity with me, and in consequence through telling evil and false statements to Captain Harrison turned that officer's mind against me. He believed in the disloyal Wali Muhammad's statements about me, and in consequence lost all faith in me and considered me to be unreliable. “Since the days of my ancestors the evil-disposed Brahui clans have continued their bad acts. In my father's time they rebelled and did evil, and at last through their bad conduct be was killed. After his death, the kindly-disrosed British Government appointed my brother Mir Mnhammad Nasir Khan as the Ruler of Khelat, but even during his time the Brahuis did not eease from doing evil. From the date that I (aided by the British Government) ascended the Throne of Khelat, the acts of disloyalty and enmity committed by the Brahui clans against my Government from first to last must be well known to Your Excellency. “These tribes aided by Wali Muhammad gained the confidence of Captain Harrison, and tried all they could to injure me. In consequence of this and out of fear of losing by their evil acts the friendship of the British Government which is of long standing with my Gov ernment, I left Khelat and journeyed to Sukkur to explain to Your Excellency the state of mv affairs. This I did, and then returned home. *■ « “On a second occasion, I went to Shahpore (in Cutehi) to meet Sir William Merewether, and in person I explained to him my desires; but as Captain Harrison was high in his favor and possessed his confidence, what I had to advance in support of my views was never listened to or considered. “After this, Captain Harrison, at the request of my disloyal Wazir Wali Muhammad, took him with him to British territory. The Wazir had in his possession my accounts which he took away with him, and these he has kept in his possession up to date.' “The Brahuis after the departure of Captain Harrison up to the present day have never ceased to do evil in the country and to commit raids on my people to the great loss of myself and them. They have also plundered kafilas and everywhere created disturbances. “ But now that Major Sandeman has come into the country, have been made very happy, as all our affairs will be settled in a way consistent with my honor. “My hope is that the British Government will treat me in a way similar to the one adopted by it with regard to the Amir Shore Ali Khan and the other Frontier Rajas whose authority over their own affairs and subjects is upheld. With regard to mysGf, 1 hope the British Government \yill place the Brahui clans under me and give me authority over them, and thus maintain my power and dignity. “ To Major Sandeman I have written a full statement of my desires, and by the blessing of God I will not fail to settle, in concert and communication with him, all my affairs and those( 96 ) of the country. I will do this in accordance with advice, and know that doing so will redoond to my honor and welfare. “ In the treaty made by the British Government through General Jacob with my late brother, the sum of Rupees 50,000 was agreed to be given on a«°un of reduction of katii, fees then arranged. This sum I yearly received up to the date of Captain Harrison s departure, although it was not a fair equivalent for the loss sustained by me m the reduction of the fe, I, however, agreed to the proposal, as it was the wish of the British Government tha should do so. Notwithstanding this, and that I still hoped for an increase of the subsidy, although I have committed no fault, what has hitherto been given me for four years has been withheld. I am in hopes that what is due may now be paid to me. “ Wali Muhammad, my Ex-Wazir ; through the influence of Captain Harrison, obtained the imprisonment of Shakar Khan, my Commandant of Troops, Mulla Saleh Muhammad and Gul Muhammad, my Munshis. These men were my faithful servants and had committed no fault. At my interview at Sukker with Your Excellency I asked for the release of these men, and'Your Excellency was pleased to say you would consider my request after the lapse of some time. I have, therefore, hoped for their being set at liberty, but up to date they are still in confinement. Be good enough to release them and permit of their returning to me. My honor is concerned in a compliance with this request. « All is well here. Consider me as your servant, and continue to favor me with your kind letters, &amp;c.^ [Political A., March 1877, No. 366.] 63. Ad interim Orders of the Government of India— Colonel Munro having reported by telegraph on the 7th and 12th June the favourable result of Major Sandeman’s negotiations the Government of India passed the following orders. They congratulated Major Sandeman on having ob tained the assent of the Khan as well as the Sirdars to the mediation of the British Government, and further instructions were promised on receipt of bis expected report. Meanwhile he was instructed to he scrupulously careful not to commit Government to any line of policy towards either the Khan or the Sirdars. He was reminded that he had not yet furnished the Government with the details necessary for the formation of an opinion as to the true character of the complaints addressed by the Sirdars in general terms; many of which were founded on statements apparently incompatible with recorded facts which had been carefully examined at the time of their occurrence. He was directed to allow the Khan adequate opportunity to learn and answer the accusations brought against His Highness by his Sirdars, and to lay his own case fully and fairly before the Government of India. Major Sandeman was to collect with impartiality, and report with fidelity, the statements made to him on both sides; to commit neither himself nor the Gov ernment to any opinion, nor to do or say anything which could have the effect of weakening the Khan’s authority in the eyes of his disaffected vassals. On receipt of the complete information which they awaited, the Govern ment of India would form their own judgment, and thereupon take such steps as they might deem expedient. And on submission by Major Sandeman of the preliminary report discussed in the preceding paragraph the Government of India decided to adhere to this deci sion and to defer passing final orders. Meantime having observed that Major Sandeman was disposed to regard favorably the Khan’s demand that the British Government should compensate the Candahar merchants plundered by the Jala wans in the Mulla and other Passes they called for more precise informa tion on the following points, viz .:— v 1 -/ ( 2 .) (3.) ( 4 .) (5.) (G.) (V.) J ie caiavans on account of which the compensation was claimed. The time and place at which the caravans were plundered. Hie persons by whom the caravans were plundered. Hie loss estimated by the owners. The compensation, if any, paid up to date, and by whom paid. The balance fairly due.

Major Sandoman’s final Report. —Eventually the final report, which had been so anxiously awaited, was submitted on the 31st July. It dealt very fully with the disputes between the Khan and the Sara wan and Jalawan Sirdars and Mir Jam Ali of Lus Beyla. it appeared that upon the Khan’s acceptance of the basis of peace prescribed in the memorandum quoted in extenso on page 92 the Saraw r an and Jalawan Sirdars were immediately sum moned to Mastung. The former being near at hand arrived the next day and at once agreed to the terms proposed. The Jalawan Sirdars arrived on the 5th July and were headed by Mir Jam Ali of Lus Beyla, Gohur Khan Zehri, Ibrahim Mingul, Shakar Khan and Saleh Mahomed Jattaks and others. They w r ere received by the Khan on the 7th July each Chief being introduced separately and tendering formal submission. Afterwards a Commit tee was appointed with instructions to consider the complaints and grievances of Mir Jam Ali and of the whole body of Sirdars, Sarawans and Jala wans alike. What these complaints severally were, and the manner in which they were disposed of, will now be explained. [Political A., March 1877, No. 402.] 65. Nature of the principal disputes between the Khan and his Sirdars and the measures taken for settling them.— In order to understand those portions of Major Sandeman’s report which deal with Mir Jam Ali and the Jalawan Sirdars it is necessary to refer to certain earlier letters from that officer. Before starting on his mission to Khelat Major Sandeman wrote to Mir Jam Ali of Lus Beyla, to Ibrahim Mingul, and Gohur Khan Zehri apprising them of. his coming and asking them to write to him fully of their affairs and wishes. He received the following replies giving an account of the grievance of the Jalawan Sirdars from their own point of view :—- From Mik Jam Ali, to Majoe Sandeman, dated llth April 1876. “I, Sirdar Mir Jam Ali, Chief of Lus Beyla, will first reply to your letter, and in doing so, I take leave to state that we (the Jalawan Chiefs) have always placed our faith in the British Government and have relied on it, as we do now, to settle our affairs. On no occasion have we rejected the advice of the British Government or refused to pay attention to it. “ The state of my affairs is as follows :— “ When Colonel Sir William Merewether was appointed the Commissioner in Sind, my father Mir Khan (the reigning Jam) wrote a petition to him, congratulating him on his appointment, and expressing his desire to he permitted to pay his respects at Karachi to the Commissioner. He desired, when there, to explain the troubled state of the country, in the hope that a permanent settlement of Biluchistan affairs might be come to. “ The Commissioner, in reply, wrote that he would be glad to see my father, and to give him notice of his intended departure a few days previous to setting out. “ The permission to come to Karachi made my father very happy, and he prepared to start. But a few davs before doing so, another letter arrived from the Commissioner directing my father to postpone his intention of visiting him for the present, as, before coming to pay his respects, it was necessary first to obtain permission from His Highness the Khan. This order of the Commissioner was contrary to precedent and usage, therefore the meeting did not take place; and in consequence, what the Jalawan Chiefs had to explain regarding the existing state of affairs in Biluchistan was never represented to the British authorities. “The next point I desire to place before you is that Colonel Phayre, late Political Superintendent, Jacobabad, wrote to my father, Jam Mir Khan, to the late Sirdar Mir Nurdin and Sirdar Mir Azad Khan of Kharan, intimating to these Chiefs that Captain Harrison had been appointed British Agent at Khelat, and that he desired they should go to that officer who had been empowered to make a fair and complete ariangement for the settlement of the Kohistan. “ The receipt of the letter again raised the hopes of all the Jalawan Chiefs, who along with Sirdar Mulla Mahomed, and the Sarawan Chiefs (the latter brought the letter), attended, as directed, on the Political Agent at Khelat, believing that a permanent settlement of our disputes with the Khan would be come to. With this object in view they remained at Khelat for some time. It turned out, however, that as the Khan of Khelat was then high in favor with the Comnrssioner, Captain Harrison adopted the same course, and no arrangements were come to. “After a good deal of talk, the Sirdars were directed to go to their homes, and were told to come again after three months, when their case would be considered. Captain Harrison also stated in writing that they (Sirdars) had come to Khelat by his order to settle their affairs; but, as they had not been justly treated by the Khan, they were directed by Captain Harrison to return to their homes. They were told to go home( 98 ) feeling secure as His Highness would cause them no injury On receiving this assurance they returned to their homes. My father on arrival there sent a letter by the hands of his Munshi to the Commissioner, informing him of his going to the Political Agent at Khelat but that no settlement had been come to by Captain Hamson. My fathers Munshi, who took the letter, remained for one month at Karachi, but no notice was taken of him. &lt;f At last the Commissioner sent for him and refused to accept the letter, saying that it should be transmitted to him through the Khan of Khelat. But, as this order was also con trary to old rule and precedent, the state of the Jalawan bndais affairs in consequence a second time did not reach the ear of the British authorities. “ I have now to draw your attention to the fact that when my father's Munshi, as stated above was at Karachi waiting to deliver the letter, the Khan s troops, on the pretence of going to Mekran, suddenly raided the city of Wadd belonging to the late Sirdar Nurdin. At the time of the raid, Sirdar Nurdin was not there. In so acting, the Khan did not fear the just resentment of the British Government for doing what was contrary to the written agreement the Sirdars held from Captain Harrison, in which he states that the Khan would not attack them. “ On this subject grave doubts exist in our minds, caused by the fact that, notwithstand ing Captain Harrison's written promise that the Khan should not attack us, his troops did so• yet His Highness was not called on by that officer to explain the act. We fear that Captain Harrison encouraged the Khan to coerce us in this way. In considering this, it has to be remembered that at the time the Khan treacherously attacked us, we, relying on Captain Harrison having written that His Highness would not do so, had in consequence dismissed our troops to their homes, and Lus Beyla was at his mercy. “We, however, to the best of our ability opposed the troops of the Khan with the small force we had at our command; but, under the circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that we were defeated. We then fled into Sind, in order to seek for justice from the British Gov ernment. The Commissioner, Sir William Merewether, received us very kindly at first, and comforted us ; but afterwards we found that he had ordered us to be made prisoners. “ If, then, these circumstances are taken into fair consideration, you will find that the distracted state of the country is due not to the Jalawan Sirdars, but to the unfair and un justifiable acts of Sir William Merewether, Commissioner in Sind, and Captain Harrison, Political Agent, Khelat. The late Sirdar Nurdin and I myself wrote several times to Sir William Merewether on this subject, but he did not listen to us. The result is that from the date of the appointment of Colonel Sir William Merewether as Commissioner in Sind up to the present time, the country has remained in a state of anarchy. Doubtless, you must have heard of this aud of the losses caused to travellers and to the people of Lus ^eyla during this period. What I have related above will surely satisfy you that our hopes rest on the British Government, and we are heartily anxious that arrangement may still be made bj r it for the peace of the country and safe transit of trade. I. desire further to inform you that since the commencement of my father's rule up to date no injury has been caused to travellers or to the people of my country. Since I myself have held charge of the Governorship of this country I have kept the trade route safe, and lave eis come and go without danger. In fact, so secure is my country that the lion and ^ rom fhe same stream. Further I have received letters from Captain ise, is uc upenntendent, Police, Karachi, expressing his satisfaction with the state of affairs on my frontier. Ihese will certify to the truth of what I have written, and if you enquire of Captain Wise about this, he will tell you what I write is a fact. Sirrlov M b ( ’ u write in your letter under reply that I should take advice from ndar Mulla Muhammad, and consider well what I am about. In reply, I beg to state that the Sirdar has advised me in a letter to abstain from raiding. nor T mv ^ ^ ^ ^ ave sa id in this letter, I trust it will be apparent that neither my father central s the r/T' ^ lnjUlT to travellers &gt; ^ve plundered kafilas.

Should the British Government make a perma nent arrangement for the country, and restore the lands of the Sirdars, confiscated by order of the Khan, to them, then I will be responsible for Mir Ibrahim Khan and Gohur Khan, and that they will not plunder caravans, &amp;c.” From Mik Ibrahim Khan Mingul, to Major Sandeman, dated 11th April 1876. “ I, Mir Ibrahim Khan, beg to acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter to my address. I have perused its contents from first to last, and consider it a great favor your sending it to us. In reply, I beg to say that the state of Jalawan affairs will be clear from Mir Jam Aiks letter. To what he has written I have only to add that it is the oppression of the Khan of Khelat that forces us to raid in his territory, and we are powerless in the matter. By violence the Khan has forced us to abandon our country and lands, and we are living in the barren hills with our followers. On account of the want of the necessaries of life, we are obliged to raid the country, which is our own property, but which has been usurped by the Khan. We for the same reason, have attacked kafilas. The Khan will not let us settle in peace, but continually oppresses us. If the British Government desires to restore peace to the country, and to keep the trade routes open, it should deliver us from the Khan's oppression. Do this and no one will ever create disturbance in the country. “ You write in your letter that you will shortly proceed to open the Bulan Pass to caravans returning to Khorassan ; but it is not clear, from what you say, whether you merely intend to do so for the returning caravans, or are going permanently to arrange to keep open the Pass. If you merely intend to do the former, all is well, but if the latter, believe me the Passes can never be safe, so long as Mir Khodadad Khan is on the throne. Prior to this, we have had no opportunity of stating our case to the British Government. This was caused by the favor shown by the Commissioner in Sind (to the Khan) who concealed His Highness' faults. 'We have therefore taken the present opportunity of placing our affairs before the British Govern ment. “ Are we not creatures of God, that we should be so treated by the Khan? His violence and oppression are so great that many of the loyal sirdars and Mirs have been killed by him for no offence. How does it happen that the British Government asks no explanation from him for his bad acts on us and on merchants ? “ You will have heard that I lately captured a kafila proceeding from Karachi to Khelat. Had it been my object to plunder people, I should not have allowed it to pass; but I did so. Our wishes are those of the British Government, and hearing of your proposed visit to the Bolan, 1 allowed the caravan to pass unharmed, merely taking Rupees 800 due to the Khan on account of transit fees from the kafila people. What I now stated is a fact, and it must prove clearly to you that my object is not plunder or to cause injury to trade. “ What I am anxious to do is to lay before the British Government my wrongs caused by the Khan’s oppression, and in doing so, I trust to receive justice from it. Should justice be done us, and should the Khan be called on to explain the murder of Nurdin and the 75 men who were with him, many of whom were men of position, then I can safely say you will hear of no more violence being done to kafilas. “In seeking justice, I am not alone concerned. There are many of the relations of deceased men who are calling out for it, and who will not cease to plunder until they receive it. We may be killed in the struggle. What does it matter if we are? Our sons and relatives will take our place, and will not cease to cry for justice at the hands of the British Government, from the British Government we hope for justice. On receiving it, we will s ttle in peace in our own country, and will bless the British Government for being able to do so.' From Mir Gohur Khan, Zehri, to Major Sandeman, dated 11th April 1876. « Mir Gohur Khan, beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, which has made me very happy. In reply, I beg to state that the letters of Mir Jam All Khan and Mir Ibrahim will have fully explained to you the state of Jalawan affairs. To what these two have written I have only to add that I was the first victim of the Khan's oppression. On his ascending the throne, he imprisoned Sirdar Taj Mahomed, the Chief of the Zehri tribe, without any fault, and at last put him to death, when in confinement. Since then he has continued to plunder my people, and his troops have taken possession of their property. Not a year passes that he does not imprison or kill some of my people. He has reduced us to such straits that thousands of our people are starving. We cannot settle in peace in our country in consequence of the Khan's acts, and we are obliged to leave the plain country and to settle in the hills, where we subsist on the plunder of kafilas, &amp;c. “ We are forced (firstly) to do this to live, and (secondly) in the hope of drawing the attention of the British Government to our state; then, on being called upon for an explana tion of our conduct by the British Government, the opportunity would thus be afforded us of placing before its officers the sad plight the oppression of the Khan had reduced us to. In doing this, we hope for justice from the British. We are either the subjects of the Khan or of the British Government. Yet the Khan is allowed to oppress us, and for our acts of retaliation we are called to account by the British Government. The Khan was truly our Ruler, but justice requires that he should be called to account for his acts against us.( 100 ) « The receipt of your letter has made us hope that justice will not he withheld from n s , What we ask is, 1st that we be relieved from the Khan J s oppression, 2nd, that our lands and rights be restored to us. I am of opinion that, until the present Khan is deposed, peace can never be restored to the country, nor the trade routes made safe. Were the Khan deposed peace would speedily he restored to the countiy. On receipt of these letters Major Sandeman urged the necessity of getting at the real truth ot the causes which had led to the existing state of affairs in Khelat, and proceeded to give the following account of the situation (Major Sandeman, No. 112, dated 24th May 1876) “ From some unexplained cause the Khan for many years past was led by our advice and support to adopt a policy in the State that had for its object the gradual extermination of the leading Sirdars and the annexation of their lands as State property, lhat this was the policy in force can be abundantly proved from the records and from the position of the Khan towards all his Sirdars and theirs towards him, and what both sides say themselves. “ His Highness the Khan instead of ruling like a sovereign Prince occupies the position of a robber chieftain on a large scale. He has a mercenary army of from two to three thousand men, which he sends against the Sirdars on their daring to leave their hills and fastnesses, but he admits that he is powerless (in fact, events have fully demonstrated this) to really conquer the country or restore even a respectable government to the State. The Sirdars, on the other hand, descend (as stated by the Jalawans in their letters enclosed*) from the hills on to the plain country and harry it. All trade is at an end, and matters, more especially during the last three years, since our relations with the Khelat Government were broken off have gone from bad to worse. In illustration of this, I refer you to what Mir Ibrahim Khan says in his letter about the capture of*a caravan and his realising the transit dues that ought to have gone to the Khan. He says he did not plunder the kafila, because be had heard of my arrival in the country, and plunder was not his object. “ I will now place before you what light the records with me throw on the state of the quarrel between His Highness the Khan and the Jalawan Sirdars. In considering this it will be convenient to remember that Jam Mir Khan married, firstly, the sister of the Khan of f She died at Hyderabad in Sind, Khelat j secondly, he married the sister')' of Sirdar Ivurdin,by her husband and son being both them whom he had Jam Ali, now ruling in Lus Beyla in bis m confinement by our orders.—R. S. father's stead, whom we detain a prisoner in Bombay. The second marriage caused great offence to the Khan, who removed his sister from the Jam’s house, and she is now with him in Khelat. A bitter quarrel also arose between the Khan and the Jam about a village called the ( Kamal Khan estate/ “ Captain Harrison was appointed Political Agent, Khelat, in March 1869. One of the first matters he was requested to undertake being to reconcile the Jam of Lus Beyla and the other Sirdars with the Khan. Major Harrison in his report thus describes the part he took in the dispute regarding the ‘ Kamal Khan estate/ ‘ His Highness came to see me on business yesterday regarding the village of Kamal Khan in Bagwana, which, as you know, has been the source of dispute between the Jam and himself for sometime past/ “ Being aware that I knew on what grounds the Jam framed his pretensions, as also the rule in Biluchistan regarding intestate estates, His Highness asked me to write to the Jam from him with the view of avoiding all further disputes for the future. The letter on tbe subject is marked A and attached to this report, and from its perusal I hope it may be thought that I have arrived at right conclusions. “I will here record Captain Harrisoi/s letter to the Jam of Beyla, referred to as i fit if sll ° U f '“| lin0wn to y° u t,lat 1,ie English Government Inis sent me to Biluehistan to benefit the country by giving advice to His Highness the Khan in different matters.

Under these circumstances I think it would be advisable for you to withdraw any agent you may have placed there, and consider the villages as belonging to His Highness the lawful heir until such time as your feel disposed to prove your right to the same/ “The above letter to the Jam shows what action the Political Agent took with regard to this dispute, and that it amounted to giving a decree in the Khai/s favor. Before recording the results that ensued from this act, I will first notice what the records say about the guarantee given to the Sirdars, and referred to by them in the enclosed letter, viz., that if they left Khelat and went peacefully home, no attack would be made on them. They say that they accepted the guarantee, and went to their homes, but were attacked by the Khan’s troops in contravention of it, therefore a breach of faith was committed. “ Regarding this Captain Harrison says : ( After a little talk they (the Sirdars) agreed to go back quietly the following day if I would give them a written pass. This I did, and guaranteed that they would not be molested if they abstained from plundering/ “ In reference to this I find that in 1872 at Jacobabad the Commissioner in Sind put the following questions to Sirdar Mulla Mahomed :—■ “ £ Question .—Did you not accept terms (at Khelat) when before the Khan ? “ £ Answer .—I accepted nothing, saying I must refer it to the other Sirdars who were at Capota. This was done, and they did not consent. Captain Harrison then said (latter end of May 1869) that if we went quietly to our homes, he would give us a written guarantee for three months'’ truce, in which time he would try and effect adjustment of matters. The Jam’s affairs took place within that period. When it occurred I fled to Candahar. “ ‘ Question .—Who began the contest? “ £ Answer .—The Khan commenced it by sending troops against the Jam. 1(1 Note by the Political Superintendent \ Captain Harrison’s letter to the Jam about the Kamal Khan estate requiring him to withdraw his people in charge was written at the end of May, and approved by the Commissioner’s letter of the 3rd June 18ti9. Within a fortnight after the Sirdars had left Khelat under the Political Agent’s guarantee, the Khan sent officials to occupy the village, and it was this that led to subsequent events, and which the Sirdars regard as a breach of the truce guaranteed them.’ £C The next notice of this affair on record is contained in Colonel Phayre’s narrative of Khelat affairs for 1857 to 1869. He writes: £ The subsequent proceedings of the Jam in the ^ . TT . , , ^ vr no Kamal Khan affair are before Government in the paper as per Captain Harrison s letters Nos. 38 . mi i i .i ^i ; i i i and 39 of 27th September 1869, and margin. 1 he Khan roused by these open threats assembled accompaniment No. 40, dated 20th a force under the Shahgassi and attacked the Jam before he October 1869, and accompaniments. p ac j -t ime ^ () organise any efficient force, and the result is that he has been defeated, whilst the victorious troops have proceeded to his head-quarters of Beyla to plunder it.’ ££ What occurred after this is well known, viz., that the Jam fled to Karachi, where he arrived in December U69. Sirdars Nurdin Mingul and Mulla Mahomed fled to Candahar. The Jam was accompanied in his flight by his son Jam Ali, now ruling in Lus Beyla, and Nurdin’s brother, Mir Ibrahim Khan, all of whom were placed in honorable confinement in Hyderabad. “The subsequent history of the Jalawan Sirdars, whose letters I forwarded to you, is soon told. On the breaking out of the Khelat rebellion in 1872, Jam Mir Khan was removed from Hyderabad to the fortress of Assergurli in Bombay, Jam Ali and Mir Ibrahim Khan remained in confinement at Hyderabad. * As a matter of fact the whole of the Jalawan Chiefs were excluded from the peace of 1872, seethe cor respondence of 1872, from page 175 to end of book—“ Confidential records of Punjab Government on Khelat affairs.” “ INone of these Chiefs* were in the mediation effected in 1872 by the Commissioner in Sind for the following reasons. I quote from his report of the proceedings which give his reasons for excluding them. He writes : £ With regard to the ex-Jam of Beyla, Meer Khan, I certainly consider that nothing should be done at present about him. The Sarawan Sirdars made no request in his behalf, and had they, I should have informed them that his many rebellions against the Khan had ended in his being obliged to fly the country. But beyond that his disregard of all rule and orders had been carried by him into the country, where a safe asylum had been generously allowed him, and that now he was answering for his disobedience to the British Government. I should not under any circumstances have recom mended his being permitted to return to his old country, feeling certain that there will be no peace there if he once more enters it, and considering he has sacrificed all claim to return.’ “ But no mention by the Commissioner in his report is made of Mir Jam Ali and Mir Ibrahim Khan, the brother of Sirdar Nurdin. It is, therefore/only necessary for me to state that in 1874 they escaped (it is said in women’s clothes) from Hyderabad, and were at once welcomed back to Lus Beyla by (respectively) their uncle and brother Sirdar Nurdin, who had been installed in the meantime by the Khan of Khelat himself as Governor or Naib cf the Province of Lus. Sirdar Nurdin at once resigned in favor of Jam Ali, and returned to his( 102 ) „wn town of Wad. Doing this I believe was the immediate cause of his quarrel with th, Khan and untimely death. . , , T h e enquired of the Khan of Khelat as to the causes which “ Since my arrival hme I have enq ^ ^ ^ ^^ it from the Commissi Kd to his itj J that he holds a purwana to this effect. That m Sip^.’ who i 0C curred is^dear from the Commissioner's report, paragraph 38. He writes 'flf Highness the Khan on the arrival of his Wazir at Khelat will make arrange- jrusnts for the proper ^—t^f the^provmce of^s Beyla, the Roon^aud IgS'n wS has been kept in hehllf of the ex-Jam Mir Khan will soon cease when it is Znd that he is really not to return. This agitation, especially in the local Press, has Wn kept up by the buuyahs, Hindu merehauts, before mentioned. Directly they see it i, useless they will abandon it, and All Khan Jamote will fall back into the subordinate and insignificant position he has always occupied until his actions were found useiul to others.' “ The policy the Commissioner adopted in taking this step is clearly explained in his 35th naiaoraph He says : ‘ It is unquestionable that there is a steady change going on in Biluchistan, m Afghanistan the same. The only plan is to assist its progress and be careful in no way to cheek it, allow it to grow peaceably as it will, &amp;c. But with such an object in view it is not clear why the brother of Mir Ibrahim Khan and uncle to Jam Ah, as well as brother-in-law to the Assergurh political prisoner, was selected by the Khan for the post. Perhaps it was with a view of bribing him to keep quiet, but this could hardly have been the case either, for in Major Harrisou’s report No. o7, dated Jacobabad^, 21st Apul 1873, I observe he states that Sirdar Nurdin surrendered unconditionally to the Khan. I will enquire into the point, and will hope to explain it in a future letter. “ But whatever the causes were which led the Khan to appoint Sirdar Nuidin to the Governorship of Lus Beyla, doing so very nearly cost him his thione, for matteis after this from various causes got so disturbed in the Khelat State and iiontiei, and especially on the Lus Beyla frontier, that the Commissioner in Sind applied to the British Government for a force to invade the country and depose the Khan. This was not granted, and matters did not improve I am told until after the escape of Jam Ali and Mir Ibrahim Khan from their prison at Hyderabad, and the appointment of a special police to protect that part of the Karachi frontier.” The two chief complaints against the Khan which Mir Jam Ali preferred before the Committee at Mastung related to two matters discussed in the letters just cited, viz .:—the invasion of Lus Beyla contrary to Major Harrison’s guarantee, and the occupation of the Kamal Khan estate. Their decision was left by Major Sandeman to the Government of India. The circumstances of the Lus Beyla affair are still under consideration. But in regard to the Kamal Khan estate the orders passed will be found at page 113. They confirmed Sir W. Merewether’s decision in favor of the Khan. The cases brought forward by the other Jalawan Sirdars were also of great importance. Amongst these were the succession of Gohur Khan to the Chief- ship of the Zehri tribe in succession to Sirdar Taj Mahomed, and of Shakar Khan to that of the Minguls in succession to Sirdar Nurdin. Matters were settled by the recognition of both Chiefs as heads of their respective tribes. Other minor cases, 37 in number, were brought by various Jalawan Sirdars against the Khelat Government, of which 31 were decided in their favour. Finally, there were the grievances—34 in all—of the Sarawan Sirdars. All of these were settled except that relating to the lucerne tax which the Khan agreed not to levy tor the current year. Its final remission depended on the degree of liberality with which the Khan’s several claims for compensation were met by the British Government. The exact nature of these minor com plaints ot the fearawan and Jalawan Sirdars is related in Appendices C and D ot Major Sandeman s report which can be referred to if need be. The terms of peace finally accepted are recorded in the following memorandum :— Translation of the terms of peace arranged between His Highness the Khan of Khelat.

Sarawan Sirdars; and whereas the said Major Sandeman has so mediated and given his advice to the Khan of Khelat and his Sirdars, and the said parties having availed themselves of it, have willingly agreed to make peace (the terms of which are recorded herein) and we do hereby declare it. B V“We, the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars, do announce our submission and allegiance to His Highness Mir Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, which we make in accordance with ancient rule and custom, His Highness having restored to us (in accordance with ancient law and precedent) our ancient rights and privileges, and having promised for the future to treat us with every kindness and consideration, provided we continue loyal and faithful to the Khelat Government according to old State usage. “ His Highness the Khan has granted the following concessions to us, his Sirdars :— “ l&amp;L —His Highness confirms the election of Sirdar Asad Khan, son of Sirdar Mulla Mahomed, to be the Sirdar of the Sarawans, and has acknowledged him as such in Durbar, and has presented him publicly with the usual khillat. “ 'knd .—His Highness acknowledges and confirms the election of Sirdar Gohur Khan of Zehri by the Jalawans as Sirdar of Zehri in room of the late Taj Mahomed, and has pre sented him with the usual khillat. “ ?&gt;rd, —His Highness recognises Mir Shakar Khan, son of the late Sirdar Nurdin, as Sirdar of the Minguls, and agrees that Mir Ibrahim Khan, his uncle, shall act for him until he is of age. He has received the usual khillat from His Highness. “We, Mir Jam Ali Khan, son of Jam Mir Khan, and the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars having made public submission to His Highness according to precedent and ancient custom, and having presented the Khan with a petition asking His Highness to intercede with the British Government for the release of Jam Mir Khan, now in confinement in British territory, and His Highness the Khan having received the petition and having granted it, His Highness forwarded it under cover of a letter from himself to Major Sandeman, asking that officer to send both to the British Government with a view to Jam Mir Khan being released. This wish we repeat in this record for the consideration of the British Government. “ His Highness presented Mir Jam Ali with a khillat as an acknowledgment of peace having been declared between Khelat and Lus Beyla and of his having been taken into favor. “The complaints and grievances brought by the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars regarding the confiscation of lands, &amp;c., against the Khelat Government were settled by a Committee appointed by His Highness the Khan. The members of the Committee were Sirdars Mulla Mahomed of Sarawan, Emam Buksh Khan, Mazari, and Jamal Khan, Lagari, on the part of the Sirdars, and Wakil Nawab Mahomed Khan, Mustaufi Fakir Mahomed and Mulla Abdulla Jan on the part of His Highness the Khan. The Committee having carefully enquired into each case recorded their opinion in writing, wdiich was presented to His High ness, who also recorded his opinion and order on each case. The papers containing the list of cases, the result of each enquiry, and final decision, are separate, but we, the Brahui Sirdars, agree to the decisions recorded therein by His Highness the Khan and will abide by them. “ The separate agreement, recorded in writing, come to by Major Sandeman with His Highness the Khan regarding the protection of the Bolan Pass trade, we, the Khan of Khelat and the Sarawan Sirdars, do hereby agree to and will abide by its terms. “ His Highness the Khan hereby agrees to treat his Sirdars of Sarawan and Jalawan with kindness and consideration in accordance with their respective positions which have been handed down to them from their forefathers. On the other hand, the Sirdars do promise to obey the Khan of KhelaCs order according to old usage. His Highness the Khan and the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars do hereby agree that what has passed between them be for gotten. For the future should the Khan/s Naibs or other officials cause any Brahui injury 01 oppress him, the matter will be referred to the Khan for enquiry and decision, and the Sirdars on this account will not rebel against the Khelat Government; but should the Khan not do justice, will first refer the disputed point to the British Government for decision. In the same wav the Khan will not wage civil war against the Sirdars for any offence until His Highness has first referred the point in dispute through the Political Agent to the Biitish Government. I, Mir Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, and we, his Sirdars of Sarawan and Jalawan, agree to this condition. In short, we all bind ourselves to hold (1) by the conditions contained in the memorandum which set forth the preliminary conditions of peace; (2) by the settlement papers containing the award of the arbitrators confirmed by the Khan ; (3) by the Bolan Pass agreement, to which we (the Khan of Khelat and his Sirdars of Saiawan) have affixed our seals, and we swear to be bound by their conditions. Further we (the Khan of Khelat and his Sirdars of Sarawan and Jalawau) do hereby heartily agree to aid to the best of oui power in keeping' open the trade-routes, to preserve the peace of the country, and we sweai we will do nothing to violate this our written agreement of peace. This our joint agreement we make over to the British Government as a record of the terms of peace made between us and to which we have affixed our seals.” Here follow the seals of the Khan; of Mir Jam Ali of Hus Beyla; of Sirdar Mulla Mahomed of Sarawan of Sirdars Gohur Khan of Zehri, of Ibrahim Mungul, of Alladina Kurd and eight others. The document was witnessed by Major Sandeman and Sirdars Emam Bux and Jamal Khan.

He complimented His Highness the Khan on the way he had acted durino-the negotiations and for having restored to h.s Sirdars and Chiefs their land., ancient rights and privileges. His Higkn ss in reply said that he himself, h,s country and people were the property of the British Government; that he was greatly indebted to t , Government for sending Major Sandeman to advise with him regarding the settlement of t, Kbelat State • that be felt greatly indebted for all that bad been done for bim, and that he would use his'utmost endeavours for the future to preserve the peace of the country now (stab, lisbed He hoped tbe Sirdars would continue to deserve bis kindness and favor; and did they do so/they might rely on bis maintaining them in their ancient rights and privileges. “ Mir Jam Ali Khan and Sirdar Mulla Mahomed on behalf of tbe Sirdars replied to His Highness. They assured him they would be loyal and true to him; that they trusted to deserve bis favor and kindness, and would in every way attend to the rules and precedents necessary to be observed by all the Sirdars of tbe Kbelat State in their dealings with their Khan. “ The settlement papers containing tbe decision' of His Highness on each dispute were then introduced and placed before him on a chair in tbe Durbar. Ihe Koran was placed with them. “ Lai a Hittu Ram, the Superintendent of the Deputy Commissioner’s Office, then read tbe following papers, which are written in Persian : “ First, tbe paper containing tbe terms on which peace bad been agreed to and to which His Highness tbe Khan and tbe Sirdars of Sarawan and Jalawan had affixed their seals. “The petition of the Sirdars of Jalawan and Sarawan asking His Highness the Khan to obtain tbe release of tbe Jam of Lus Beyla, Jam Mir Khan. “ The Khan’s letter to Major Sandeman asking that officer to submit tbe petition to the Government of India for favorable consideration. “ After this tbe contents of the other papers were notified to tbe Durbar. “ Major Sandeman after pointing to tbe Koran and remarking on the solemnity of the occasion asked His Highness tbe Khan if he agreed to tbe contents-of tbe papers on the chair before him, and whether be was willing to be bound in bis dealings with bis Sirdars by their contents. His Highness cordially replied that be was quite willing to be bound by their contents, and that by tbe grace of God be would fulfil their conditions. “ Tbe Sirdars were asked a similar question and they all responded in the affirmative- most of them very heartily and in a loud tone, a few not quite so heartily. A salute of 19 guns was then fired from a bill, a short distance off, overlooking tbe Durbar tent on which tbe two mountain guns had been stationed for the purpose. Ibe Khan of Khelat’s band, which was in attendance, afterwards played a lively tune during which tbe khillats were introduced into tbe Durbar tent. To Mir Jam Ali His High ness the Khan presented 1 handsome lungi, 1 than kinkab,’ 1 than of white cloth, 1 horse, and Rupees 100 in cash. Khillats^ were also presented by His Highness of nearly the same value to Mir Asad Khan, birdar Gobar Khan, Zebri, and to Mir Ibrahim Khan for his nephew, tbe son of the late Nurdiu. r On presenting the kbillats His Highness placed tbe lungi around the person of each birdar, who on accepting it kissed his hand and touched bis feet. They made very submissive speec ics, telling His Highness in a loud voice that they were bis subjects and slaves and he could rely on their loyalty. His Highness throughout tbe Durbar seemed highly delighted and expressed great satisfaction with the conduct of the Sirdars in the way they addressed him. A little sensation was caused by Mir Ibrahim Khan, the brother of the late Nurdin, who on being told to receive the khillat set aside for him said he could not do so, as he was not t ie .iidar of the Mmguls but merely the representative of his young nephew, Sirdar Shakar Khan, but he would take it in trust for him. J &amp; n r , n:„^ n mf havu ! 8 ' his assent to this, the khillat was made over to the Sirdar T i ^ 1 J iev ' • le birdais present then congratulated those who had received khillats an ffid°so reco gnized by Hi s Highness as the Sirdars of their tribes. His Highness also“After this Major Sandeman presented khillats (in the name of the British Government for services rendered to him on the present occasion) to the following Mirs and officials of the Khelat State: “ To the Khan's two nephews, Mirs Karam Khan and Gohur Khan, each 1 choga, 1 hand some lungi, and 2 thans of white cloth. “Wakil Nawab Mahomed Khan, Mustaufi Fakir Mahomed, Mulla Abdulla Jan, and Naib Pir Jan, each received 1 choga, 1 lungi, and 1 than of white cloth. “ This closed the proceedings. The Khan of Khelat and all the Sirdars then raised their hands in prayer to God and said the “ Fatia, ” which is considered equivalent to the most solemn oath a Muhamadan can take and which is said on all such occasions and ceremonies as the one they had just taken part in. “Before the Durbar broke up Mir Jam Ali Khan rose, and on the part of all the Sirdars of Sarawan and Jalawan presented Major Sandeman with a paper containing an address thanking him for the manner in which he had mediated between them and His Highness the Khan. A translation of this address is attached to this diary. The Durbar broke up by His Highness the Khan taking his leave. “Translation of a letter from Sirdars of Bilucliistan to Major R, G. Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner, on special duty, dated 13th July 1876. “We, the Sirdars of Biluchistan, Sarawans and Jalawans, now present in Durbar at Mustung by order of Major Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan, desire to express our thanks to the British Government. Our reasons for thankfulness are these: Our country was in a distracted state: peace seemed impossible, and in consequence the Sirdars and Chiefs left the plain country and took to the hills. One result of such a state of things is that the Jam of Lus Beyla has now been in confinement in British territory for eight years. But by the good management and sound judgment of Major Sandeman we trust that the release of the Jam from confinement may be obtained. We are all greatly indebted to the British Government for having given their kind attention to the state of this country and by their deputing Major Sandeman, who is an officer of wisdom, good temper, and sound judg ment, to arrange our affairs and to restore peace to us. The said officer has by good manage ment characteristic of him settled our differences with the Khelat Government in a most satis factory way, and this is testified to by the Khan, ourselves and Major Sandeman, being all present together to-day in this Durbar. “ His Highness the Khan has also been kind to us, and has shown favor to us by restor ing our ancient privileges and rights. His Highness has also on our joint petition to him been good enough to recommend the British Government to release Jam Mir Khan, and this act of His Highness has caused us to feel gratitude to him. One thing we regret and that is that Jam Mir Khan could not be in to-day's Durbar, but we feel certain that through the recom mendation of Major Sandeman and the kindness of the Government Jam Mir Khan will soon be able to attend similar Durbars. Finally, we trust that through the good management _ of Major Sandeman the peace now established may be a lasting one, and thus enable cultivation and the prosperity of the people to increase daily. “ {Seals of) Mir Jam Ali of Lus Beyla and of the Sirdars Gohar Khan, Zehri, Ibrahim Khan, Mingul, Mulla Mahomed of Sarawan, Asad Khan, son of Sirdar Mulla Mahomed, Said Khan, Junda Khan, Shahwani, Chakar Khan, Jattak, Mohiem Khan, Guignaii, Kadir Baksh, Rahman Khan of Noshki, Alladina, Kurd, Alam Khan, Rashkani, Shadi^Khan, Bungul- zai, Sohrab Khan, Lehri, Saleh Mahomed, Musiani, and Fateh Khan, Lotiani.

Arrangements for the security of trade through the Bolan Pass. —It will have been seen that among other matters agreed to by the Sarawan Sirdars was the settlement regarding the Bolan Pass concluded between Major Sandeman and the Khan. The circumstances of this settle ment were as follow :—In their Besolution of the 16th of October 1875 the Groy- ernment of India took into consideration the question of restoring, peace in Cutchi and of protecting the transit of trade within the territories of the Khan of Khelat. They directed Major Sandeman to enquire and report whether anything could be done for the protection of trade via the Bolan, and whether a system of fixed tolls on caravans could not be ananged the proceeds of which would go to the tribes interested in the protection of the route. And discretion was given to him to make any arrangements he considered advisable within the total sum sanctioned after the Mithunkote conference, viz., Itupees 66,960 per annum. The Government of India added that if these measures were successful in affording reasonable security to trade and if the Khan shewed an earnest desire to co-operate and to return to a proper sense of his duties, they would, on receiving an expression of regret at what had occurred, restore the former subsidy and re-estaolish fuendly( 106 ) relations It was not until be met the Khan at Mustang in June 1876 that Majm Sandeman was able to complete arra = safe passage of traffic through the Bolan Pass. W hat these anan 0 ements were will now he described. The two principal trade routes through Beluchistan-the Bolan Pass aad the Mulla Pass have been described above (vide page i h). With regard ta loth passes the Khan was prohibited by the Treaty of 1854 from charging ou.tom dues at a higher rate than eight annas per maund. But he was cUrectiy interested in encouraging traffic through the Mulla or Southern Pass and in closino 1 the Bolau because he was obliged to pay to various tribes the sums realized as fees for escort through the Bolan, whereas with regard to the Mulla Pass he was able to take all such fees on his own account. The fees taken from the caravans are of two kinds, viz., the Sung 01 customs dues which are levied at Quetta and Dadar, and the Buddruki or escort fees. The first named belong entirely to the Khan with the exception of one-seventh of the Dadar fees which are deducted in favor of the chief Sirdar of the Sara- wans. The escort fees were given in a very arbitrary way to any tribe which happened to be in the Khan s favour. The points which the Khan and Major Sandeman had to consider were first the protection of caravans through the Bolan Pass itself, and, secondly, their protection from Dadar through Cutchi until they reached the British outposts stationed in Khelat territory. Major Sandeman discussed three plans with the Khan. These were, first, that the Khan should take on himself the entire duty of protecting the passes and trade routes ; secondly, that the British Government should undertake this duty relieving the Khan of all responsibi lity; thirdly, that the Khan should avail himself of Major Sandeman’s influ ence with the tribes, and acting in concert and communication with him should arrange with them for the safety of trade through the Bolan Pass and Cutchi. The first two plans were rejected as unsuitable to the existing position of affairs. The Khan was unable to undertake the duty unaided, and if the British Govern ment undertook it they would necessarily collect the fees and distribute them as they pleased, whereby the Khan would suffer loss. The third plan w 7 as the one most feasible and most advantageous, hut effect could only he given to it by the Khan treating the tribes in a fair and just spirit and by his securing to them their ancient rights and privileges. The Khan readily accepted this proposal and admitted the necessity of assigning the escort fees to the tribes who escorted the kafilas through the pass. The transit fees would continue, he said, to he collected at Dadar and Quetta according to custom, and if any alteration of system should hereafter become necessary he would consider it in communication with Major Sandeman. Por the present the following arrangements were made. Sirdar Aladina Kurd was placed in sole charge of the pass and made responsible for the fair distribution of the escort fees. He agreed to keep 60 men belonging to the Murree and Kurd tribes at the village ot Kirta in the heart of the pass. Also to keep 40 men belonging to the Mingul Brahuis and Dumar Kakar tribes at the Dasht plain in the hot weather and at Ab-i-gum in the cold weather, where they would be always available for escort duty. The cost of these arrangements was fixed at Rupees 18,000 a year, and the supervision of the whole was entrusted to Sirdar Mulla Mahomed Raisani, who would bring to notice any shortcomings on the part of Siidar Aladina. With regard to the Khan’s preference for the Mulla route there were strong objections to yielding to it. In the first place he had no light to attempt to close the Bolan, and the Mulla route w 7 as not only much longer hut also, from physical conditions, more dangerous and inconvenient to those using it. As an inducement to the Khan to refrain from diverting caravans through the Mulla route Major Sandeman suggested the advisability of mcreasmg by 20,000 or 25,000 Rupees the subsidy assigned to the Khan by the treaty ot 1854, as compensation for the loss of his fees. These arrange- time WGre approve(i and llave continued to work satisfactorily to the present [Proceedings, Political A., October 1875, No. 278.] » March 1876, No. 457.] [ roceedmgs, Political A., March 1877, Nos. 267, 313, 329, 380 to 383, and68. Major Sandeman’s remarks in regard to the call for a special report—see page 97. The Sarawan grievance regarding the lucerne tax. —In paragraph 16 of his final report Major Sandeman referred to the orders quoted in paragraph 63 above, directing him to abstain from committing the Government to a line of policy towards either the Khan or his Sirdars, and to submit an ample and accurate statement of the facts of the situation. Putting aside the other instructions as sufficiently complied with by letters and reports subsequently submitted, he took up specially the remark that “ many of these complaints are founded on state ments incompatible with recorded facts which were carefully examined into at the time of their occurrence.” He referred the Government of India to the Commissioner in Sind’s report No. 310, dated 5th April 1872, and contended that the grievances preferred therein would be found on comparison identical with those which he had recently settled. The difference between the present mediation and the former one consisted in the fact that the settlement now agreed to had been carried out whereas the previous one had existed only on paper. He thus illustrated his view of the matter:— “ Por instance, take the Sirdar’s complaint about the lucerne tax. Regarding this the Commissioner in his 21st paragraph of his report above referred to says: ‘ There would appear to be some foundation for one act on the part of His Highness the Khan or his fol lowers, which savored of not sufficient regard for the interests of the people that during his tour last summer in some places an undue quantity of forage (lucerne) was appropriated and full compensation not given. At least the Wazir’s replies on this point are not complete, and in conversation he allowed this might have been the case. But I would point out that this was the first time for eight years or so that the Khan had been able to visit that neio-hbourhood, and it is after all not such an unusual circumstance when native rulers traverse their country. 1 do not mean to say it is right, but surely it is not sufficient to warrant rebellion as a means of obtaining redress. “The above impression of this grievance of the Sirdars was given by the Wazir to the Commissioner, and to say the least of it putting it in the above light was most disingenuous of him as it entirely misled the Commissioner as to the true nature of the complaint. The Sirdars do not object to give the Khan free of cost ordinary supplies of forage when encamp ed amongst them this they did lately during the Khan’s stay at Mustung, but what they really complained of was a very oppressive tax newly imposed on them by His Highness, full particulars of which were given in diary for the week ending 23rd June 1876. His High ness the Khan has merely in defence of the imposition of this tax to say that the obtaining of forage for the winter months by requisitions on all in the way complained of is necessary as he has an army to maintain which no former Khan kept up. He fully admits the griev ance, but says he is too poor to remove it. I think the matter is one which demands the serious attention of the Government of India, simply on account of the nature of the measure called a trangar, as it may mean, I found, any size the fancy of the Naib chose to dictate. The Brahuis did not expect to be altogether exempt from giving lucerne (which is cultivated by them in the same way as wheat, barley, &amp;c.), but they reasonably enough desired that the size of the ‘ tranger’ should be fixed, or that the Khan’s Government should levy the tax in nnoVi instead of in kind I verv nearly obtained the sanction of the Khan to the last-named proposal and I feel certain His Highness, if liberally dealt with regarding his yearly allowance in the way proposed by me will take my advice on the point. He knows that this tax falls heavilv on the poorer class of cultivators, and that its levy affords a fertile source of bribery.* I believe the empty state of his treasury caused by rebellion, and having to keep up in consequence such large establishment, has had much to do with this and other acts of oppression which, without doubt, the Khelat Gov ernment has been guilty of during the last 12 or 15 years. “ B u t if other examples are necessary regarding what I state, there is the fact that the grievances of the Jalawan Sirdars, including those of the Jam of Lus Bela, for reasons given by the Commissioner in the 36th, 37th and 38th paragraphs of his report were not enquired into and disposed of at all. Moreover the Sarawan Sirdars were not obliged as directed by to restore all property seized during the rebellion by the Sirdars and their followers from the ryots of Biluchistan, whether in Khorassan or Cutchi. from the first the Sirdars apparentlv objected to do this, knowing probably that it was out of their power to do so, for the Commissioner in his 27th paragraph records: f At first the Sirdars raised objections to Nos. 2 and 3—(2) that the property plundered from the kafilas be given up to the owners, (3) all property seized during rebellion to be restored—but I informed them no deviation could be allowed, &amp;c.’ “ Doubtless it can be advanced that kafilas were plundered in the Bolan by the tribes after the Commissioner’s mediation, and also in Bagwana and Khozdar by the late Sirdar Nurdin, and that the Rupees 90,000 paid from the Khan’s treasury went to reimburse the losses of the merchants to whom they belonged. I do not think that this fact, if suchut is, alters the line of reasoning in the least, for the principles on which the Commissioner’s decision was based * It may be mentioned here that in subsequent cases the lucerne tax has been fixed by local arbitration. A given number of “ trangars ’ of a fixed size at a fixed rate being awarded in each case. (Sd.) T. C. P.( 108 ) are clearly laid down in his 25th paragraph, and these are m no way altered were this the case. He enunciates them in the following words : ‘the second and third stipulations I considered only equitable and unquestionably necessary Were they not enforced, a premium on rebellion would have been established, and the faithful many would have been in a worse position than the rebellious few The Sirdars and their followers would have largely benefited by the plunder they got possession of when engaged in lawless proceedings, and it would have been to the advantage of the unruly in future to side with any Chief who chose to raise the stand- ard of re vole, while traders who were passing- through the country relying on the good-will of the inhabitants thereof, and the poor people of the country who were leading peaceful lives, would have been the chief sufferers. a These words surely can leave no doubt as to the intentions of the Commissioner, and the grounds on which his decision was given, and that therefore His Highness is right when he says that it was not in accordance with the mediation of 1872, that he was mulcted in Rupees 90 000 to pay the merchants who had been plundered by the robber tribes, and that the Sirdars could not be considered to have fulfilled the conditions of the mediation until after they had returned to the ryots the plunder they and their followers had taken from them during their successful rebellion. “ I have been particular in bringing these points forward, as to my mind they go a long way to demonstrate why it was that the former mediation did not prove successful. It seemed, moreover, desirable and necessary to explain the Khaifs statements on this subject contained in his letters to my address already forwarded. But the cause for the former mediation prov- ing unsuccessful will be still more apparent if in addition we consider the case of the late Sirdar Nnrdin and his exclusion from it, as well as the imprisonment of Sirdar Mir Khan of Lus Beyla, his son Mir Jam Ali, and brother-in-law (Nurdin's own brother) Mir Ibrahim Khan. The fact of the exclusion of Nurdin from the mediation did not escape the notice of the Government of India, for in the 4th paragraph of the Foreign Secretary's letter No. 1214P., dated the 30th May 1872, to the Secretary to Government, Bombay, in recording their opinion on the subject, they expressed their anxiety at it in the following words:— “ ‘ As to the advisability of the Commissioner's procedure in abstaining from further endeavors to bring Nurdin Mingul within the compass of the reconciliation effected between the other Sirdars and the Khan, His Excellency in Council is disposed to believe that it would be better even yet to hold out to him a direct offer of an amicable settlement. Unless, indeed, Sir William Merewether feels sure of the Khan's ability to coerce him. Until the disorders consequent on the Sirdar's continuance in arms are put a stop to, the suppression of the insur rection cannot be considered as complete. Intelligence of the steps taken with this end, and of the measure of success by which they are attended, will therefore be anxiously awaited by the Government of India.' “After this was written, it is true that Sirdar Nurdin did submit to the Shahgassie, and that such was reported, and that in consequence he was placed by His Highness in charge of the province of Lus. But I would ask you in considering this to remember that notwithstand ing his nominal surrender (subsequent events have proved it was only nominal), his sister’s husband, Mir Khan, whose place Sirdar Nurdin took as ruler of the province of Lus Beyla, remained in our hands a prisoner, as well as his own brother and nephew. Under such circum stances unless (as noticed by the Government of India in their letter above referred to) the Khan had the power to coerce Nurdin and maintain the peace of the Jalawan country, as well as that of Lus Beyla, the suppression of the insurrection could not be considered as completed, and therefore as a sequence the mediation could hardly have been expected to prove effective.” [Secret, June 1872, No. 394.] [Political A., March 1877, No. 402.] [Khelat Diaries Nos. 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44 and 45 of 1877.] [Fiom Ojfg.

In other respects the complete operation of thrules were suspended, but the following extract, paragraphs 26—32, from Major Sandeman’s report explains why in his opinion the active interference of the British Government in Khelat, in its character of Paramount Power, is abso lutely necessary to the welfare of that country. *.* * * * * * * “ 26. I will now briefly notice the form of Khelat rule and demonstrate the absolute necessity that exists for the Government of India in order to preserve the peace of the country which it has brought about only after great trouble and expense, taking a much more active part in Khelat politics than it has hitherto done. Both the Khan of Khelat and his Sirdars look to the British Government as the paramount power to settle all quarrels and difficulties that from time to time may arise between them, and consider themselves entirely subordinate to it. This feeling is very strong with both sides, and in our own interests surely we ought to cherish and maintain it. “ 27. On account of the long civil war which has existed more or less since the present Khan came to the throne 20 years ago, the estrangement of the Khelat Government from the Sirdars of Biluchistan has become greater and greater year by year, until the two sides had come to act as if their interests were entirely separate, instead of being as is really the case identical. Until the date of the recent peace not one of the Sirdars of Biluchistan, with the exception of Sirdar Fakir Mahomed Bezanjoo, Naib of Kedj, had the least intercourse for good with the Khan or his Government. “ 28. But recent events have shown that however deep the evil had penetrated at heart, both sides felt it to be a great one, and one the British Government alone had power to cure. This appears clear from the memorandum filed by the Khan, which formed the basis on which peace was made, and from the fact that the Khan on the opportunity being afforded him by the intervention of the British Government at once recognized the election by the tribes of Sirdars Gohur Khan, Shakar Khan, and ksad Khan to the Chieftainships respectively of Zehri, Mingul, and Sarawan. This is a very important point and worthy of much thought, for it'is also a fact that Gohur Khan since the death of Sirdar Taj Mahomed in 1865 had refused, because he was not recognized as his successor, to be reconciled to the Khelat Govern ment. ' He and his followers infested the roads and injured trade and the Khan's Government, on the opportunity offering, in every possible way. Yet when called upon by me to come to Mustung and pay his respects to His Highness, he not only did so without demur, but on his election by the tribe being recognized, he made full submission to the Khan and took the oath of allegiance to his Government. As a result it is admitted on all sides that for the future the B-aj^route to Kurrachee via Lus Beyla, as well as the one by the Mulla Pass to Jacobabad, will be perfectly safe. Surely this is a very instructive episode in the history of Khelat politics and speaks volumes. I read it in this light. That although the Khan and his Sirdars have been separated by circumstances for years, their estrangement is not incurable. That both sides feel the necessity that exists for supremacy being maintained over them by the British Government, and recognize to the full that its interference in their joint interests when necessary can alone preserve the peace of their country. This is further clear, I think, from both sides desiring the British Government to deprive them of the power to wage civil war until after they have obtained permission from it to levy it. a ^g. At the present moment the Khelat Government consists of the Khan and his Naibs as the civil administrators of the country, and his two Commandars, Fakir Mahomed and Mosun Khan, at the head of about 2,500 mercenary soldiers, most of whom are Pathans from the Candahar and Pesheen valleys as his military power. Most of the Naibs are household slaves, and the Khan has invested them with absolute and irresponsible power. In short, on account of the life of retire ment His Highness leads being shut* up in his palace from one year's end to the other, there is no check on them whatever. As said, with the exception of Sirdar Fakir Mahomed, not a single Sirdar is connected with the civil administration of the country. “ 30. When I first asked His Highness to come to Mustung, I heard he was quite willing to do so • but that one of his Commanders, Mosun Khan, who is a Pathan from the Pesheen valley did all he could to prevent it. However the influence of this officer was not all power ful, and the Khan on certain matters regarding which I have already reported being explained to him at once did as I requested. « 31 . Still as the Sirdars are very numerous, and as they and their tribes form the real etreno-th of the country, to preserve the peace between the two sides under present circum stances and difficulties of the situation the direct interference of the British Government acting as the paramount power is absolutely necessary and must be maintained. I he Khan, his Sirdars and civil and military administrators know this perfectly, and have one and all expressed to me their conviction of the entire impossibility of forming or continuing a united or harmonious administration without a continuance of the assistance and direction so lately afforded them by my mediation; hence the mention even of my leaving the country has been viewed by both parties in the State with dismay. But to make its interference really effective for the future the British Government must state to both sides that it accepts the responsibi lity they desire to enforce on it, and will aid them materially as the paramount power to preserve the peace of the country, and moreover in my opinion it should be fully impressed on all that the British Government will view with extreme displeasure, now that the affairs ol the country have been got into respectable order, any departure on the part of His Highness * Caused, I believe, by dread of as sassination on account of tbe state of things between His Highness and his Sirdars. (Sd.) R. S.,( 110 ) Government or on the side of the Sirdars from the terms of agreed to between ttem at Mustang, and which they have taken a solemn oath to abide y “ 32 Personally the Khan, Mir Khodadad Khan, is a weak Prince, but at the same time he is not without considerable ability. During the recent negotiations, I have watched him carefully and well; and although convinced of this I am equally so of his loyalty and devotion to our Government whose interests he considers to be his care as far as he has the power to watch over them. He is very easily influenced for good or evil, but has the greatest resjeot for the British Government, and I feel certain from what I have seen of him that any advice His Excellency the Viceroy may consider it expedient to give him when replying to his letter lately forwarded will not pass unheeded. But much will depend on the form it takes, and in sayino- this, I trust I do not exceed my province. I say so because my own expenence of tie Khaii* has told me that on account o£ his peculiar temperament and education, advice when o-iven to he lasting must be impressive, and must act as a salve to his own doubting uncertain and hesitating nature. There is nothing that I have seen about him to make me believe that he is at heart evil-disposed, cruel, or in any way unworthy of the kindness and consideration to our Government Far from it: I firmly believe the present unhappy state of his Government has been brought about and is due as much to force of circumstances over which he had no control as to any other cause. But taking the state of affairs as described by me into con sideration, and as I believe them really to exist, it will, I doubt, not readily he admitted that the presence of an experienced European officer at his Court (for the present at all events) fully supported by our Government to aid and guide him in the management of the Khanate is essentially necessary, and unless this is granted, I am of opinion the present mediation will not get a fair trial, and the peace of the country consequently will probably not last.” {Political A., March 1877, Nos. 402 and 408 to 411.] {Minute by His Excellency t\e Viceroy, dated ZZnd September 1876.] {Paras 50 et. seq. vide K.

Settlement of the affairs of the Murri and Bugti tribes. —it remains to mention the negotiations for the adjustment of the disputes between the Khan and the Murris and a very brief notice will suffice. In July 1876 Sirdars Imam Baksh Khan and Jamal Khan were deputed by Major Sandeman to discuss with the Khan the settlement of the Murri quarrel. His tlighness agreed to make peace with the tribe, and wrote a letter to Sirdar Ghazan Khan, the Murri Tomandar, offering certain terms and inviting the Sirdar and his headmen to meet him at Kutchee in the cold wea ther. This letter was taken by the Sirdars above named to Kahan, where its contents were fully discussed by a Council of the Murri Chiefs and the terms offered accepted. The Chiefs wrote in submissive terms that they would pro ceed to Kutchee to meet the Khan and in the meantime they made arrange ments for maintaining a detachment of sowars (30 in number) at Kutt Mundai for the protection of the Bolan Pass and of Kutchee from Murri thieves. On the 6th of September Sirdar Ghazan Khan, the Chief of the Murri tribe, died at Kahan. On hearing of this occurrence Major Sandeman consulted with the Khan as to the measures necessary for the protection of Kutchee until the effect of the Sirdar’s death on the tribe was known. It was decided to send Captain Wylie to Dadur with a detachment of Sind Horse, while the Khan wrote a letter of condolence to Sirdar Mihrulla Khan, and promised to recognize him as his brother’s successor and to confer the usual khillut. In December 1876 Mihrulla Khan accompanied the Khan of Khelat to Jacob;)- had, where he witnessed the execution of the Supplementary Treaty and was presented to the Viceroy. In March 1877 Mihrulla Khan was presented with a khillut in recognition ot his succession to the Chiefship of the tribe. Since the settlement of his affairs this Chief has heartily co-operated with the British Government in preserving peace, and on one particular occasion his com net afforded a remarkable proof of his honesty of purpose. Sherdil Khan Mazaram, who was “wanted” for the part he took in the murder of a Hi a nu m the Bolan Pass in April last, sought refuge with Mihrulla’s tribe, i t rough the surrender of a fugitive under such circumstances is strongly opposed to local feeling and customs Mihrulk Khan did not shrink from the task. Mierdii Khan was given up, and was sentenced by Major Sandeman to pay Eupees 700 blood-money to the family of the murdered Brahui and to furnish security to the amount of Bupees 1,000 for future good conduct. {Political A., March 1877, Nos. 394, 420, 432-434, 458-460 and 375.] _ {Political A., July 1877, No. 379.] [Pohtival A., October 1877, Nos, 315 aad 319.] {Political A., November 1877, Nos. 33-35.71. Action taken by the Government of India on Major Sandeman’s Report. Colonel Colley’s deputation— Major Sande- man’s report was subjected to very careful consideration by the Government of India. And, for an explanation of the policy which it was decided to adopt, I must refer to the two minutes on Khelat affairs by His Excellency the Vice roy which are printed.in Appendices X and XI of this Precis. In accordance with the views therein expressed the Viceroy addressed a khureeta, dated 10th September, to the Khan, sending it by Colonel Pomeroy Colley, His Excel lency’s Military Secretary. It informed the Khan of the Viceroy’s intention to visit the western frontier in the cold weather, and invited him to meet His Excellency at Jacobabad about the 6th December. On the subject of the recent settlement His Excellency wrote :— “ It has given, me sincere gratification to learn from Your Highness* letter of the 10th of May last, and by subsequent communications received from Major Sandeman, that Your High ness appreciates so cordially the efforts made by the British Government to extricate you from the difficulties with which you have long been surrounded. “ My friend, it is not necessary for me on this occasion to consider the many points of detail raised in your letter concerning the past affairs of your country. I need only assure Your Highness that, although the distracted state of affairs in Khelat has given the British Government just cause of concern and dissatisfaction, this Government has, at no period, had any other wish than to assist you in the maintenance of your power and dignity, to secure the peace and safety of your dominions, to promote the prosperity of your rule, and to enable you to exercise your authority in the manner most conducive to the interests of Your Highness and the welfare of your people. “ I need not point out to Your Highness that these objects cannot he attained without a due regard to the established rights of the hereditary Nobles of Khelat. « My friend, I offer you my sincere congratulations on the result of your successful co operation in the peaceful settlement of the recent disputes between yourself and your Sirdars; and I have no hesitation in according my general assent to the principle of those arrangements, which, with the concurrence of Your Highness, have been made by the British Agent for the future safe transit of trade through your country, and the lasting reconciliation between yourself and your Nobles. ******** «My friend, it will give me much pleasure to meet Your Highness on the occasion to which I have referred. I feel assured that, by such personal conference, we may now bring our mutual relations to a satisfactory settlement, and permanently strengthen the ties of amity and friendship between the two Governments. It is my sincere desire that the reign of Your Highness should henceforth be not only peaceful, but powerful and prosperous; and, so long as you continue to desire, and deserve, the friendship of the British Government, it will be my study to give effect to this desire. « a special mark of my consideration for Your Highness, I send this khureeta by the hands of Colonel Collev, a high officer of my personal staff, to whom Your Highness can unreservedly explain your wishes, and settle, in communication with him and Major Sandeman, the necessary arrangements for our meeting at Jacobabad. Private instructions were at the same time furnished to Major Sandeman * For the text of this draft Treaty see Appendix XL t Article VI .—For the further consolidation of the friendship herewith renewed and established between the two Governments, it is agreed, on the one hand, that British Agents with suitable escorts shall be duly accredited by the Government of India to reside permanently at the Court of the Khan, and such other parts of the Khan’s dominions as may be mutually agreed upon ; and, on the other hand, that a suitable Representative shall be duly accredited by llis Highness to reside permanently at the Court of the Viceroy of India. + Article IX—The Meer, on behalf of himself, his heirs, and successors, agrees to prohibit for ever t.,e practice of importing, or kidnapping, human beings by any persons subject to His Highness’ authority, for the purpose of slavery ; and, should there be any such, now or hereafter, in a state of bondage within the limits of that authority, who may have been enslaved in the manner above mentioned, he engages to use his best efforts for their liberation and continued freedom. regarding the submission to the Khan of a draft Treaty* Supplementary to that of 1854. The Khan replied on the 19th October. He cordially accepted the pro posal to meet His Excellency at Jacoba- had, agreed to the draft Treaty, and affixed his signature to it. At the same time he threw out the following suggestions. The appointment of an Agent at the Court of the Viceroy, as provided by Article VI,f would cost Rupees 1,000 a month. He desired, therefore, that his Agent might remain, as heretofore, at Jacobabad or that the British Government should bear a portion of the cost if they still desired that the Agent should remain with the Viceroy He thought that Article IX {( 112 ) could not be carried out. * Article X—To reimburse Meer Khodadad Khan for the losses recently entailed on his exchequer by- internal revolt, and to evince its friendship ana regard for His Highness, the British Government hereby presents Meer Khodadad Khan with a sum of three lakhs of rupees. Article X/.—Furthermore, in order to aid Meer Khodadad Khan, his heirs, and successors, in the efficient fulfilment of the obligations contracted by them under the Treaty of 1854, and the present Supplementary Engagement, the British Govein- ment hereby undertakes to pay to the said Meer, his heirs, and successors, an annual sum of one lakh of rupees, so long as they shall faithfully adhere to the engagements heretofore and hereby contracted. The tribes of Belucbistan were accustomed from old time to keep slaves who were well treated and were content. If he were to accept the provisions of this Article, all the tribes would be dissatisfied. With regard to Articles X and XI* he thanked the British Government for the money presented to him and relying on their good- will hoped to get increased favours. He was grateful also for the increase to his subsidy, but expressed his intention of speaking with the Viceroy on the subject at their meeting. [Political A., March 1877, Nos. 418 and 438-439.] 72. Reception of the Khan by His Excellency the Vice roy at Jacobabad. Execution of the Supplementary Treaty. His Excellency’s address to the Khan.— In the prosecution of his autumn tour His Excellency the Viceroy arrived in due course at Jacobabad where in the forenoon of the 8th December he received the Khan’s visit. His Excellency was attended by the Eoreign Secretary, Sir W. Merewether, others, while the Khan was accompanied by Major Sandeman and a 1 retinue of Sirdars and State officials. The Viceroy thanked the Khan for his cordial reception of Major Sandeman, congratulated him on the settlement which had been arrived at, and the measures already taken to carry it into effect. The Khan from time to time expressed his assent to all that was said, and repeated his sincere desire to carry out all that had been agreed upon. Shortly afterwards the return visit was paid, hut the conversation was of a purely complimentary character. In the afternoon of the same day the Khan, accompanied by Major Sandeman, paid a private visit to the Viceroy for the purpose of executing the new Treaty. The Eoreign Secretary, Colonels Munro, Burne, and Colley, and the principal Sirdars of the Kkelat were present. After the Treaty had been executed in duplicate, His Excel lency retaining one copy and the Khan the other, Lord Lytton addressed His Highness to the following effect:— “ His Excellency commenced by expressing the sincere pleasure he felt in meeting His Highness at Jacobabad, and in signing with him a new Treaty on behalf of the British Government. “ This Treaty—His Excellency proceeded—would, it was hoped, prove the lasting basis of close and cordial relations between the two Governments, and also serve to maintain unbroken the peace and good order of Khelat. In order to strengthen still further the bonds of friendship between Elis Highness and the British Government, and at the same time to afford His Highness material assistance in replenishing his treasury, which had been exhausted by the anarchy of recent years, His Excel- eney had now the pleasure of offering for his acceptance a sum of three lakhs of rupees, which sum would be made over to any officer His Highness might depute to receive it. The Khan received the announcement with great gratification. His Excellency then adverted to the pleasure with which he looked forward to again meeting the Khan at Delhi, observing that in his journey thither through British territory * 18 ^ghness would see further evidence, not only of the power and prosperity of the great Government with which His Highness was now closely allied, hut also of its friendly feeling towards himself. “ The reception of His Highness at Delhi would be marked by all the honors which, as representative of the Queen and Empress of India, His Excellency gladly offered to the repre sentative of an important and friendly State in firm alliance with the British Government, and so long as His Highness continued to act in a manner worthy of his high position, he might confidently count on the continuance of our friendship and protection. f But m order/ His Excellency continued, ‘ to act in accordance with the principles of r° d , mt \ Your Highness, it is necessary (and of this I am sure I need not that yj should abstain'from anV^L: 6811601 ^ ° £ y0aC “ ^ i iip /' y^aty the British Government has undertaken serious obligations 1111 y , ' l,ir Sited win e T tS ‘Z 4 YoUr Hi S hMSS will listen to its counsels, width willalway. bo dictated by a sincere desire for your welfare aud that of your subjects.&lt;c ‘ It expects that you will loyally act upon the advice tendered to you by its representative, and abide by his decision in all cases referred to his arbitration/ “ His Highness replied that he fully understood and accepted all the obligations, and recognised all the duties imposed upon him by the Treaty. “ Then, addressing the Sirdars, His Excellency reminded them that they had been named in the Treaty, and were therefore equally bound by its terms; that the Treaty imposed obli gations upon them as well as upon the Khan, their suzerain; and that any breach of these obligations by further acts of rebellion would bring upon them the displeasure of the British Government. “They replied that they fully understood and accepted the duties imposed upon them. “ Then addressing both the Khan and Sirdars, His Excellency continued —‘ Those who have entered into an engagement with the British ' Government for the common advantage must remember that if they fail to carry out the terms of the engagement, they must forfeit the advantages secured by it/ “ The Viceroy proceeded to inform the Khan that he had selected Major Sandeman to reside at the Court of His Highness as the representative of the British Government. ‘ I have done so/ His Excellency said, ‘ for two reasons: first, because it is to Major Sandeman that Your Highness is indebted for the renewed friendship of the British Government; and secondly, because Major Sandeman possesses my entire confidence; I trust this appointment will be agreeable to Your Highness/ “ The Khan replied that the arrangement was entirely satisfactory to him, as Major Sande man was an officer for whom he had the highest esteem and regard. “ With regard to the Khar/s representative, His Excellency continued, he might for the present continue to reside at Jacobabad, or at the head-quarters of the Government of India, or at any other place in British territory which might be more convenient to His Highness. « His Excellency then informed the Khan that having learnt from Major Sandeman that it was His Highness 4 5 wish that certain persons, viz., Shakar Khan, Commandant, and Munshis Saleh Mahomed and Gul Mahomed, now detained in British territory, should be released, it was His Excellency's intention to comply at once with the wishes of His Highness, trusting that he would recognise in this act a further proof, not only of the friendship of the British Government, but also of His Excellency's personal confidence in the continued loyalty of His Highness' own Government. a Eurther, that having considered His Highness' recommendation in favour of the return of Mir Khan, the* Ex-Jam of Lus Bey la, he was prepared to accede to it on the following con ditions :— cc (1.) That the Jam acknowledges the Khan's suzerainty in accordance with ancient usage. ' . « (£ ) That he accepts and abides by all the conditions of the reconciliation which his son, the acting Jam, agreed to on his behalf at Mustung in July 1876. « (3 ) That he accepts as final and agrees to respect the decision given by Major Harrison and confirmed by Colonel Sir William Merewether, Commissioner in Sind on the 3rd June 1869 , regarding the Kamal Khan estate, whereby the said estate was awarded to His Highness the Khan. “ ) That he agrees to accept as binding on himself and successors all the terms of the engagement executed this day between the British and Khelat Governments on behalf of their respective subjects and officers, so far as those terms may in anywise effect, or be applicable 4 ‘ \ml now’, His Excellency concluded, ‘ I have only to wish that, under the benign nrotection of Almighty Providence, Your Highness may long continue to enjoy all health and happiness, whilst ffiso promoting the happiness of your Sirdars and your subjects. « ji: s Highness, after expressing his gratitude for the favor shown him, and repeating his deshe to carry out to the utmost the wishes of the British Government, whose servant he was said he would venture to prefer one request, Wz., that whenever the British Government contemplated the location of any cantonments m Khelat territory, or the establishment of linesof telegraph, or the construction of railways, the Governor-General would, before carry ing out the intention, cause him to be informed and consulted in regard to it. « His Excellency, in reply, assured His Highness that nothing could be further from his • i ,f, fl..,,, to take any action of the kind without previously informing His Highness and camfullv conffic^iug alfh/had to say in the matter; Ld he further pointed out that it was expressly provided in the new Treaty that such measures as those referred to by His Highness were to be carried out in concert with him. « The Khan expressed himself fully satisfied.' {Proceedings, Political A., March 1877, Nos. 458-460.]( 114 ) 73. Text of the Supplementary Treaty with the Khan Of Khelat— The following are the terms of the Supplementary Treaty which is dated Jacobabad, 8th December 1870 : “ Whereas it has become expedient to renew the Treaty of 1854, between the British Gov. eminent and Naseer Khan, Khan of Khelat, and to supplement the same by certain additional provisions calculated to draw closer the bonds of friendship and amity between the two Governments, the following additional Articles are herewith agreed upon between the Right Hon’ble Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton, Baron Lytton of Knebworth, in the County of Hertford, and a Baronet of the United Kingdom, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and Grand Master of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, on behalf of the British Government on the one hand, and His Highness Meer Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, on the other:— “Article I .—The Treaty concluded between the British Government and Meer Naseer Khan, Khan of Khelat, on the 14th of May 1854, is hereby renewed and re-affirmed. “ Article 2. —There shall be perpetual friendship between the British Government and Meer Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, his heirs and successors. “ Article 3.—Whilst on his part, Meer Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, binds himself his heirs, successors, and Sirdars to observe faithfully the provisions of Article 3 of the Treaty of 1854, the British Government on its part engages to respect the independence of Khelat, and to aid the Khan, in ease of need, in the maintenance of a just authority and the protection of his territories from external attack, by such means as the British Government may at the moment deem expedient. “Article 4.—For the further consolidation of the friendship herewith renewed and re-affirmed between the two Governments, it is agreed on the one hand that British Agents with suitable escorts shall be duly accredited by the British Government to reside permanently at the Court of the Khan and elsewhere in His Highness'’ dominions, and on the other hand that a suitable representative shall be duly accredited by His Highness to the Government of India. “Article 5.—It is hereby agreed that should any dispute, calculated to disturb the peace of the country, arise hereafter between the Khan and the Sirdars of Khelat, the British Agent at the Court of His Highness shall in the first place use his good offices with both parties to effect by friendly advice an amicable arrangement between them, failing which the Khan will, with the consent of the British Government, submit such dispute to its arbitration, and accept and faithfully execute its award. “Article 6. W hereas the Khan of Khelat has expressed a desire on the part of himself and his Siidars for the presence in his country of a detachment of British troops, the British Government, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1854, and in recognition of the intimate relations existing between the two countries, hereby assents to the request or His Highness, on condition that the troops shall be stationed in such positions as the British Government may deem expedient, and be withdrawn at the pleasure of that txovernment. 1 A tide 7.

Circumstances, which it is unnecessary to detail, led to the deputation, towards the close of 1875, of Captain (now Major) Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner of the Dera Ghazi Khan District of the Punjab, to Biluchistan, for the purpose of effecting*, if possible, a peaceful settlement of inter-tiibal disputes and opening the way to a renewal, under certain conditions, of friendly relations with the Khan’s Government. Major Sandeman returned in January 1876 with a satisfactory letter from the Khan, and the result of his mission was sufficiently encouraging to induce the Government of India to depute him a second time to Khelat terri tory, with a letter from the Viceroy (Lord Northbrook) to His Highness in reply. During his second mission Major Sandeman succeeded in re-opening the Bolan Pass for' traffic, and in effecting a reconciliation between the Khan and his Sirdars; at the commencement of the cold season the Khan and his Sirdars proceeded with Major Sandeman to British territory, and, on the 8th D( comber 1876, a new Treaty of friendship re-affirming and supplementing the Treaty of 1854 was executed at Jaeobabad by His Excellency the present Viceroy and His Highness the Khan. “3 ; In the new Treaty it is agreed, inter alia, that the British Government shall aid the Khan, in case of need, in the maintenance of a just authority and in the protection of his territories from external attack (Article 3); shall assist, if need be, in settling disputes between the Khan and his Sirdars (Article 5) ; shall station troops in Khelat territory in such positions as may be deemed expedient (Article 6) ; and (Article 7) shall construct from time to time such lines of Telegraph or Railway as may be beneficial to the interests of the two Govern ments. “It is further agreed (Articles 9 and 10) that the British Government shall, in addition to an enhanced subsidy of one lakh of rupees per annum, contribute Rupees 20,500 annually towards the establishment of posts and development of traffic along the trade routes in His Highness’ territories, provided such money is expended by the Khan in the manner approved of by the British Government; and (Article 4) that British Agents with suitable escorts shall be accredited to reside permanently at the Court of the Khan and elsewhere in His Highness’ dominions. “ 4.

The Khan was informed of the arrangements in the following khureeta :— a I have the pleasure to inform Your Highness that, in fulfilment of the promise made by me at Jacobabad, and in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the new Treaty, I have arranged for the re-establishment of the Khelat Agency by the permanent deputation of Major R. Gr. Sandeman to represent the British Government in Your Highness' dominions. “Major Sandeman has received the high and honorable designation of Agent to the Governor-General, and will correspond directly with the Government of India; he has my entire confidence, and you will find in him a friend always prepared to co-operate heartily with Your Highness in securing tranquillity in Biluchistan, and promoting arrangements for the development of trade, the improvement of communications, and other measures likely to be beneficial to the interests of the Khelat and British Governments. “ I feel assured I may count upon Your Highness reciprocating the friendly spirit which has dictated his appointment. “Major Sandeman will have under his orders three Assistants and a Medical Officer, with each of whom you are already well acquainted; one of them is Mr. Bruce, another Captain Reynolds, late Assistant Superintendent at Jacobabad, the third is Captain H. Wylie, and the Medical Officer is Dr. O. T. Duke. “ Major Sandeman has conveyed to me the wish expressed by Your Highness that it may be so arranged that the officer in charge of the British relations with Khelat, should be also in administrative charge of the British District of Jacobabad. “ I regret that considerations of importance prevent my acceding, for the present, to Your Highness' request, but, in order to meet as far as possible the object Your Highness has in view, instructions have been issued, which I trust will secure the cordial co-operation of the officers of districts adjacent to the frontier with Major Sandeman in reference to matters affecting the interests of Khelat. “Your Highness has already been informed by telegram that, in accordance with your previouly expressed desire, Major Sandemau, on his return to Khelat, is. to proceed to Mekran and Punjgoor for the purpose of settling, if possible, the affairs of that distant portion of your territories. I feel sure Your Highness will gladly afford Major Sandeman, while so employed, your cordial assistance and support. In conclusion, I beg Your Highness will accept the expression of my best wishes for your welfare and that of your Sirdars and people, and my earnest wish that the friendship which has been so auspiciously renewed between the Khelat and British Governments may continue and increase; and that the arrangements now determined on may result in securing the main tenance of peace, and the increase of prosperity throughout Your Highness’ dominions.'

Release of Mir Khan, Jam of Lus Beyla— In March 1876 the Government of Bombay submitted tlie following memorial signed by 110 Sirdars and others, praying for the release of Mir Khan, the exiled Jam of Lus Beyla. This memorial was referred for report to Colonel Munro, and in the meantime orders upon it and upon a similar petition received from the Jam himself were deferred :— “That Memorialists are induced to appeal to Your Excellency in Council in behalf of the late Jam of Beyla, Meer Khan, a Chieftain who endeared himself to one and all in Lus Beyla, and who, through a concatenation of events, was deported, by orders of your Govern ment/from Hydrabad in Sind to Poonah in the Dekhan. “ That Memorialists do not wish to trouble Your Excellency in Council with a recapitula tion of the several events which occurred in Beloochistan within the last few years, and which led to the Jam seeking an asylum in Sind, where he had full faith in the friendship and hospitality of the British Government to warrant his entertaining the belief that his person and liberty were safe. «Th a t Memorialists will however, with Your Excellency in Council's permission, touch briefly on a few of the leading incidents which brought about an estrangement of feeling( 118 ) between the Khan o£ Khelat and the Jam, and to their unhappy differences must be attributed the sad reverses which have overtaken the latter. “ That it is well known that the position and dignity enjoyed by the Jam were not conferred on him by the Khan of Khelat, as is generally supposed, the Jams of bus Beyl a have enjoyed an independent position altogether for the last loU years One of the Jam’s ancestors conquered the country from its origina possessors the Boorfuts, a well known tribe in Sind at the present day, they having tied to and settled m the province after the conquest. The conqueror of Lus Beyla derived no assistance whatever from the Khan of Khelat of that dav A connection was formed between the family of the Jam of Lus Beyla a century and a half ao-o and the Khans of Khelat of that period through three of the daughters of the Jam being given in marriage to the Khans; three of the daughters of the Khans were also married to the descendants of the Jams. “ That Memorialists would beg most respectfully to impress on the attention of Your Excellency in Council the fact of the Jams having always been independent rulers, and as such never paid tribute to the Khans of Khelat; they used then own seals, and had their own superscriptions as rulers on the coins of the country. Owing to the family connection between the Khans and the Jams, peace prevailed throughout the country, and the two potentates lived on terms of amity with each other. • “ That one cause of dissension between the present Khan of Khelat and the Jam, who is married to a sister of the Khan, was the Jam taking unto himself a second wife in the person of a sister of Noordeen Mingul, the Chief of the Mingul tribe, who was so treacherously murdered lately, with seventy-two of his companions, by orders of the Khan, particulars of which tragedy are no doubt known to Your Excellency in Council. “ That the other and greater cause of dissenssion was the confiscation of the share the Jam had in the country called Baghban, and which portion descended to the Jam by right of inheritance from his uncle Meer Kumal Khan, the descendants of whom were supported by the Jam. A portion of Baghban was owned by the Jam during the rule of Meer Nassir Khan, Sherdil Khan, and, for about five years during the rule of the present Khan, Khodadad Khan. “ That matters between the Khan and Meer Khan continued on an unsatisfactory footino' for some time, serious differences occasionally arising, and complications at times of a grave nature threatening the peace of the country; until, at last, Meer Khan found it necessary for the safety of his life to leave Lus Beyla and seek an asylum in Sind. a That what took place in Sind, and why and how the Jam was deported as a State prisoner, and kept as such in the Dekhan, are matters of notoriety, and well known to Your Excellency in Council. “ That it is necessary, however, for Memorialists to point out some important facts in connection with the deportation of the Jam, facts which Memorialists beg Your Excellency in Council will take into consideration. That the Jam sought an asylum in British territory as any private individual would have done; he felt assured that his person and liberty would be secure under the British flag, and it was far from his intention to take advantage of his position in Sind to foment dissen sions in Beluchistan between the Khan and the people under his rule. That the Khan exercised his influence over the Commissioner in Sind, Sir William i I ere wether, an official who, it is notorious in Beluchistan, always had a strong and unmistake- a . l eaiuil g' towards the Khan, and succeeded in getting Meer Khan arrested as a State prisoner and sent into exile. u That the Government, acting on the one-sided representations of Sir William Mere wether accorded its sanction to the measures suggested by that official, and the result has men ia 10 am 1 as been suffering captivity for the last six years, although there is notai iota ot a charge against him of any kind. i ^ Gov —t suspected that Mem- Khan, the Jam, by being in Sind, had easi Klvin’s Cnvprnn ln ”f ^i X e ^ us Beyla to commit acts of hostility towards thi Beluchistan .mthfi ’ ^ u V s eav ^8‘ Sind, therefore, was essential to the peace o that effect * nml t /f Ve &gt;e ^ u eas ^ r do than to convey an intimation to him t&lt; founded on fact 0 m ‘ lle a or ongk enquiry as to whether the suspicions of Government wer Government e cou rse which justice would have recommended being folic makin” due' enouhv o Y haTe observed, took the unusual measure, wil foreign land. ’ y ’ * kmS a prlSoner o£ the Jam, and sending him into captivity^epeultit^ ow i sealj^; ^ coi^'i. ^lat aij |; ^ a seciijf; ingiiltri^ s ) by orJeisiij in CoukI iscation oilj d to le Is wloiD 5 ®; durino; In, rale of | [n an msatife ationsattiif Kban foil ii ind, was deported i , and welkt some imports ists beg W ier in ; a strong^' iban arrf* being in Si ^ of tiostilitf J ssential M *' ( 119 ) u That Memorialists will not presume to sit as censors over the acts of the British Government, nor will they attempt to question the motives actuating- the Government in its proceeding's towards the Jam. They will, however, content themselves with the expression of an opinion, and it is, that the attitude assumed by the British Government towards the Jam was perfectly unjustifiable, being warranted by neither reason, equity, nor justice. That it is well enough known that when the subject of a foreign Government seeks refuge in British territory, the Government of which he is a subject, cannot demand his being delivered up when there is no charge of felony hanging over him, neither would the British Government interfere in the slightest degree with his personal movements, or that liberty which he enjoys in common with British subjects. “That there was no charge preferred against the Jam, save and except such unfounded accusations as the. Khan may have thought proper to bring, but whether there was a charge or not, it will be admitted, any offence committed by the Jam, granting for argument’s sake that he had offended, could have been but a political one, and as such not cognizable by the British Government. “That the position occupied by the Jam was not that of a private individual, all the more necessary, therefore, was it for the utmost forbearance to be exercised towards him. “ That numbers of political refugees from European countries have found an asylum in England, where their persons are perfectly safe. The rule that applies to such cases in England surely applies to England’s dependencies. “ That waiving all such considerations, Memorialists will assume that the ostensible reason for the removal of the Jam from Sind, where he took refuge relying on the friendship of the British Government, and whence he was conveyed as a State prisoner, was that he might not be in a position in which it was supposed he would otherwise have been, to foment dissensions in Beluchistan. In other words, the Jam in Sind would be a firebrand; in the Dekhan he would be powerless. “ That the impressions the British Government thus laboured under showed clearly the erroneous conceptions it had instilled into it, evidently by the Commissioner in Sind, Sir William Merewether, in respect of the actual position occupied by the Jam, in reference to his personal powers, and to the people of Beluchistan. “ That the British Government should know that the exceeding popularity of the Jam is such that it is not necessary for him to be in Sind to secure a zealous advocacy of his cause; neither is it necessary for him to be in the Dekhan for the purpose of estranging the feelings of the people from him. His cause is the people’s cause wherever he may be, and this fact ought to be impressed seriously on the attention of the British Government. “ That the notion which evidently got hfdd of the British Government that the Jam’s deportation was a certain means of securing the tranquillity of Beluchistan, is now, Memorial ists presume, sufficiently dispelled, for ever since the Jam left Bey la things have been growing from bad to worse, until matters assumed such a serious aspect that there is now security for neither life nor property in the country. “ That if it was believed that the further the Jam was removed from Beluchistan, the better it would be for that country, Memorialists would most respectfully ask why the extreme measure taken against the Jam has not produced the desired result. “ That as it has been conclusively proved that keeping the Jam in captivity has not had the slightest effect in restoring peace to Beluchistan; on the contrary. Memorialists would respectfully beg the British Government to reflect whether it is not doing a gross act of injus tice to a Chieftain who is more sinned against than sinning, by keeping him in exile for no earthly purpose whatever; his detention as a State prisoner, under such circumstances, is nothing short of a tyrannical measure. “That Memorialists would beg respectfully to impress upon the attention of the British Government that, as a highly popular ruler, the Jam, in his present unfortunate position, has elicited widespread sympathy from all classes, who earnestly desire his release and his restoration to his mother country, and Memorialists feel confident the British Government will, on due reflection, see the necessity for respecting the feelings and wishes of the people of Beluchistan in that respect. “ That the altered state of the relations between the Khelat Court and the British Gov ernment has removed any obstacles there may have been, at one time, in the way of the Jam’s restoration. The obstinacy and intractable spirit of the Khan, and the determination he has evinced to refuse to abide by the counsels of the British Government, have necessitated the removal of the British representative at the Khelat Court, and the withdrawal of the annual subsidy paid to the Khan. These facts demonstrate clearly enough that there are no relations( 120 ) v 'Rrltish and the Khelat Governments ; such beinon the raw H^may^wdl^be^sked on what grounds the British Qovernment considers itself h detaining the Jam. “ Tlmf the events of the past few weeks, and the chronic state of rebellion in which Beluchhrtan has been, for some time, prejudicing most materially the caravan trade betwee, “an and India, have necessitated action be ';|‘^mmiLoner to has, Memorialists are informed, despatched a special Commissioner Khelat. “ That the British Government must now be sensibly alive to the fact that the Jam could not have been the author, as he has been represented to be, of the dissensions which so W rent the peace of Beh.ohistan, and spread anarchy throughout the country, for the Jam ha, been for some five years an exile and a prisoner. “ That the actual cause of the demoralization Beluchistan is the offensive attitude maintained by the Khan of Khelat towards the Sirdars of Beluchistan, who have been subject to any amount of oppression and contumely at his hands, so much so as to have driven many of them into exile, and others into rebellion. “ That had the Khan of Khelat pursue 1 a conciliatory policy towards his Sirdars, and conceded them their ancestral rights and privileges, of which he has ruthlessly deprived them, the tranquillity of Beluchistan would never have been disturbed, and things in that now mVhn/nnv country would have pursued the usual even tenor of their way. “That the Khan's imperiousness and tyranny created a feeling of hostility towards him on the part of the Sirdars, one and all of whom are violently opposed to him, and they have resented the gross injustice and grievous injuries done to them, in either covert or open acts of rebellion. “ That the actual facts as regards the long existing anarchy in Beluchistan are, as Memo- rialists have stated them to be, and they would, therefore, beg most respectfully to ask, with what pretence of reason the unfortunate Jam can be held accountable or responsible for the results of the Khan of Khelat's own despotic proceedings, and the antipathy he has engendered among his Chiefs in consequence. “ That it has been made manifest enough, bv the withdrawal of all political powers from the Commissioner in Sind, Sir William Merewether, that the British Government has been convinced that the policy pursued by that official has been a most objectionable one; one con ceived in utter ignorance of the causes in operation in Beluchistan in bringing about the misrule and anarchy which have for so long prevailed in it. “That it was owing to the misrepresentations, as Memorialists verily believe, of the Commissioner in Sind, that the British Government was induced to take the extreme measures it did against the Jam, and Memorialists neetf hardly perhaps observe that as in all other matters affecting Beluchistan, so with facts connected with the Ex-Jam of Lus Beyla, the Commissioner in Sind has grievously misled the British Government, and thus committed it to a line of policy which was highly injudicious, fraught with mischief, and which has pro duced effects which it will take years to remove. “ That Memorialists beg leave most respectfully to state, by way of conclusion, that the people of Lus Beyla are, almost to a man, strongly attached to the Ex-Jam, who is decidedly the man of the people; and the British Government could not have committed a greater mis take than to seize his person and send him into exile. “ That the notion that his being in captivity is essential to the peace and well-doing of Beluchistan must now he an exploded one, for facts within the last six years have demon strated conclusively otherwise. “That if so minded, the adherents of the Jam could, wi bout the slightest interference on his part, or the least encouragement from him, create troubles in Beluchistan; and that so far from his removal to the Bekhan preventing discord, anarchy, and their attendant con sequences, the country would be in a chronic state of rebellion, even if the British Government removed the Jam to the antipodes. The root of all the evils that have beset Beluchistan, and brought it to the verge of ruin, is the Khan of Khelat's tyranny; the axe must, therefore,he applied there, for if the British Government is at all solicitous about the well-doing of the country, it would adopt measures to bring the Khan of Khelat to a proper sense of ms responsibilities, instead of expatriating a Chief who has really been sinned against, and 'jm has been made the scape-goat to bear the sins and iniquities of a ruler, who is detested by the great masses of his subjects, whose very name is held in abhorrence in Beluchistan, and made a proverb tor all that is vile and contemptible. “ That Memorialists beg, therefore, that Your Excellency in Council will he induced to order the release of the Ex-Jam of Lus Beyla and his restoration to his native countiy, wherehis arrival will be hailed with every demonstration of joy, and where his presence will conduce to bring about peace, and security for life and property, of which Beluchistan has, for some years, been deprived.^ In May 1876, in writing to Major Sandeman and promising to be guided by his advice, the Jalawan Sirdars referred to the case of the Jam and prayed for his release. It appeared also from the allusion to the Jam’s affairs in the memorandum of the terms of peace to which the Khan was willing to agree that His Highness’ own feelings against the Jam were not very hostile. And in the address presented by the Sirdars to Major Sandeman at the Durbar on the 14th of July it was stated that the Khan had agreed to recommend the British Government to set the Jam at liberty. It has been seen from the account of the meeting between the Viceroy and the Khan at Jacobabad that this recom mendation was accepted and the Jam’s release sanctioned upon his signifying his acceptance of the conditions named. The Jam did accept the conditions, and left Poona on the 21st of January 1877. He arrived at Kurrachee on the 2nd of February and started thence for Lus Beyla on the 10th. The British Government paid his travelling expenses and those of his party as far as the frontier.

General Report to the Secretary of State and expla nation of the policy of the Government of India towards Biluchistan. —The proceedings of the* Government of India related in the foregoing paragraphs were duly reported to the Secretary of State. The des patch (No. 50, dated 23rd March 1877) related the actual events of the past year and explained at length the principles by which the policy of the Government of India had been guided.

We have now to report the completion of arrangements for what is we trust a satisfactory and durable settlement of the various questions which in connection with this subject have long caused us serious anxiety. “ Your Lordship, in your reply to our letter of the 22nd January 1875,t expressed the , xt to , . ™ , , of7 K ' hope of Her Majesty’s Government that, should the f No. 13, dated 22ud January 18vo. r ,, i a i r ' ■ measures then reported by us tor improving the con dition of our western frontier produce their anticipated results, an early opportunity might be taken of again placing the relations between the Government of India and the Khan of Khelat on the friendly footing provided by the Treaty of 1854, and of thus f re-establishing a posi tion of affairs desirable in the interests of the British Government and essential to the conti nued existence of Khelat as an independent State.’ “ This injunction we have kept steadily in view throughout our dealings with the Khan, and we are hopeful that the information we now place before Youi Loidship may secure foi our proceedings the approval of Her Majesty’s Government. But as these proceedings may appear to involve a departure from the policy of our previous relations with Khelat, we deem it desirable to recapitulate briefly the history of those relations. Ibis will sufficiently explain the causes and character of the situation we have had to deal with in our endeavours to give effect to the wishes of Her Majesty’s Government, as expressed in Your Lordship’s above- mentioned letter. “ The political institutions of Khelat are, as Your Lordship is aware, in the main of a feudal character, that is to say, the Khan rules, not directly over the people, but over a num ber of tribal Chiefs, who in turn exercise over their own tribes a power which has never been sharply defined, but which practically resembles that of the great Barons during the feudal period of Western society. The Khan’s personal possessions are comparatively small; and the4 ( 122 ) , , r _ , nnfVmrifv of His Highness and his officers are few in number. The people who obey the ' belongs to one or other of the numerous tribes or clans bulk of the population of Biluchistan^ and Jalawan8 . The respectlve included m the tuo „ association with an hereditary Prune Minister, have at all times these two tribal sectio , R ;i i istan a s the constitutional advisers of its Ruler.

These which must he ie » a m i ne nt position throughout the history of the Khanate; the two three personages o py P h ions 0 f the nobles, and the hereditary Minister as the repre- Fro - t J ieir rr nt r ru f les t fo i ; in f uence aud sentative oi xi from anything that can properly he called popular discontent, have arisen P °Tuf the houbL wS have hitherto distraeted the Khanate. The history of Khelat is, ill short the customary chronicle of feudal society in an Asiatic State, from whose social ferment* no stable political organisation has yet been evolved. Sanguinary revolts rap.dly alte nate with restorations of a power ruthless in retaliation. Ihe Sirdars are ever ready to fill,t for their cherished liberty to be lawless, and the Khan is rare y able to enforce his autho rity except by a droitly playing off one Chief or tribe against another. n Practically this authority has always been in proportion to the vigour of the Khan’s personal character, and dependent on the strength of his will rather than on that of law and tradition But among all these elements of political disturbance and weakness, there exists one souree of stability, the importance of which can hardly be overrated. This is the exceed, inodv strong sentiment of clanship, and loyally to the hereditary principle, which conspicuously characterizes both the people and its Chiefs. On the one hand notwithstanding frequent assassination, periodical revolt, and chronic anarchy, this Khanate has descended in almost uninterrupted legitimate succession, through a period of one hundred and ntty yeais, and a line of nine hereditar v Princes, to the present Ruler. On the other hand, almost every effort on the part of a Khan to dispossess a hostile Chief of his power, uproot an opposing tribe, or sup- press a disaffected family, has completely failed. Through good report and evil report the tribes have, habitually, clung to their hereditary Chiefs; and the Chiefs have habitually resumed allegiance to their hereditary suzerain. &lt;( j? rom their earliest period our relations with Khelat have been embarrassed by the diffi culties inseparable from all dealings with a weak, unsettled Government. In the main, our policy has been guided by the principles which would regulate our intercourse with the estab lished Government of any neighbouring State. We have generally supported the ruling power; because it represents the only unit of collective authority with which we can conve niently deal, or which it is practically possible to hold responsible for the maintenance of interna tional engagements. But it has not seldom happened that the proved and acknowledged in ability oi the ruling power to enforce its own authority has obliged us to act independently of it. Thus, both Sir C. Napier and General Jacob undertook, and carried out, the punishment of tribes nominally subject to the Khan of Khelat, but whose conduct the Khan was powerless to control; whilst, on the other hand, Sir Henry Green succeeded in compelling and enabling the Khan to punish very efficiently, on one occasion, the most troublesome and insubordinate of these semi-independent tribes. So, also, a treaty extremely valuable, so long as the Khanate was governed by a powerful ruler, became valueless when the country had practically fallen into the hands of rebellious and irresponsible Sirdars. If, therefore, the policy pursued towards Khelat during past years by the Government of India exhibits signs of frequent apparent change, such change is not attributable to vacillations of principle or purpose, but to the in evitably varying conditions of the situation with which this Government has had to deal. “ The one thing which at no time, past or present, the Government of India has ever been able to do, however strongly it might wish to do it, is to remain an unconcerned and inert spectator of what passes immediately beyond our Western border. The connection existing between the tribes and populations inside and outside this border is so direct, so closely intimate, that any disturbance of the latter vibrates instantaneously across the frontier; and civil war in Bilucldstan involves, so long at it lasts, not only the closing of our main trade routes across that country, the maltreatment of our merchants who use them, and the incessant spoliation ot their property, but also an unsettled and seriously unsafe condition of British territory extend ing along the whole length of the important province of Sindh. To this reason must be attri buted the fact that the strongest advocates of a policy of non-interference have, as regards our relations with Khelat, invariably ended by becoming the advocates or executors of measures o interference, sudden and violent, in proportion to the length of time during which moie moderate and consistent intervention has been postponed. “ It would be tedious and unnecessary to recapitulate the numerous occasions of such reluctant hut unavoidable interference, or to describe the various forms it has assumed. On J two such instances call for special notice in our present letter. Of these the first is the conclu sion of a Treaty signed in 1854 with Nassir Khan, the then Ruler of Khelat. By thatTreaty, the provisions of which are familiar to Your Lordship, the Khan practically became subordinate to, and dependent on, the British Government. The position thus accepted by the Ruler of Khelat has often been disregarded, and has long remained unenforced, by the Government of India; but, theoretically at least, it has never ceased to be acknowledged, not only by His Highness, but also by the Sirdars and people of the Khanate. In all their internal dissensions. they have constantly, and of late most urgently and unanimously, appealed to the British Government as the only power to whose impartial authority they are all willing to submit, anu whose duty they all considered it to be to maintain peace between them. “ The second instance is of less general importance. But it has a much more direct con nection with recent events. Indeed it may be regarded as the origin and cause of our present position in Khelat. As Your Lordship is aware, the reign of Khodadad Khan, the present Ruler of that Khanate, has been marked by more than the customary prevalence of anarchy and civil war. This, during the year 1871-1872, culminated in a general rebellion, which occasioned such serious disturbance on our frontier as to necessitate the interference of the Government of India. Our Commissioner in Sindh was accordingly authorized to mediate formally between the contending parties; and, together with a representative of the Khan, the principal Sirdars of Khelat assembled to meet the Commissioner at Jacobabad on the 28th of March 1872. Of the details and results of that arbitration Your Lordship is already cognizant. It temporarily suspended the civil war then desolating the Khanate and disturbing the British border. But our future relations with Khelat were neither settled nor improved by it. It constituted a marked and very important departure from the policy which till then had governed our relations with that Khanate. For the first time the Sirdars of Khelat appeared as recognized parties to what was virtually an international contract between the British Government and that of the Knanate, whilst at the same time the Khan was still, as heretofore, assumed to be the only responsible power in the country, and held answerable for the due execution of our award, not merely against himself, but also against his recalcitrant Sirdars, whom that very award had deprived His Highness of the power of coercing. “ Such a position could not possibly be maintained. The temporary adoption of it had been forced upon the Government of India by the fact that the previous position had ceased to be tenable, and it was necessary to terminate as promptly as possible a situation which had become altogether intolerable. But it is only due to the Government of Bombay that record should here be made of the opinion then expressed by that Government, that the unprece dented acknowledgment of the rebellious Sirdars of Khelat, as a recognized power in the Khanate, must ‘ subvert the KhaiFs authority and perpetuate troubles/ This prediction was promptly verified; nor can there be any doubt that the step taken in 1872 rendered necessary and inevitable further steps in the same direction. By the arbitration of 1872 the British Government assumed and accepted a position in Khelat which could neither be aban doned without the simultaneous annihilation of its salutary influence in the Khanate, nor practically maintained without a greatly increased exercise of authority. a Meanwhile, matters in Khelat went on from bad to worse. The counsels of the British Agent, unsupported as they were by any exhibition of power, or any indication of the Government’s determination to enforce them, were systematically disregaded by the Khan ; until at last Major Harrison, who had lost all influence at the Court of His Highness, was withdrawn from it in 1873. The payment of the annual subsidy to His Hig’hness was simultaneously withheld; and the Government of India ceased from all communication with the Khan in reference to the measures requisite for the security of our Western border. “ From 1872 till 1875 our relations with Khelat continued to grow rapidly more and more unsatisfactory; and more and more detrimental to those British interests which it is our duty to protect. Outrage followed upon outrage; no redress could be obtained, and the frontier became so disorganized that the chief authority in Sindh recommended armed intervention in Khelat, and the deposition of its Ruler. Our reasons for not adopting this recommendation were placed before Your Lordship in our letter No. 13 of 22nd January 1875. We preferred to make another effort in the cause of peace, by sending an officer of great experience in deal ing with the hill tribes upon our Western border, under the orders of the Commissioner in Sindh, into the Murri Flills, with a view to effect, if possible, a settlement of the troubles on our immediate frontier; and to provide for the security of the Bolan route. We further in structed him that should these measures prove successful in affording security to trade through the Khelat territory, and should His Highness the Khan show an earnest desire to co-operate for that end, and to return to a proper sense of his duties, f it would afford the Governor- General in Council great pleasure, on receiving an expression of regret for what occurred, to restore the former subsidy, and to re-establish the old friendly footing with His Highness Government/ We selected Major Sandeman to carry out these views. “Major Sandeman started from Dera Ghazi Khan on the 18th of TSovember 1875. He was well received at once by the Murri and Brahui Chiefs, and later by the Khan himself. Bull reports of his first mission and its results are annexed to our despatch l\o. 64 of the 17th of March 1876. Although, for reasons, on which it is not now necessary to dwell, that( 124 ) .ission was not in all results. Both parties o ^ otracted and apparently interminable struggle. The advent of °a British offic^ in the character of mediator between them was weleomed by the Kh» ltl Sirfat a ke The old instinct of willing subordmat.on to the authority of the Briti* Government was proved to he as strong as, and indeed stronger than, ever An opp„ rtu% 5 whicT llil Highness immediately availed himselt, was thus offered to the Khan £ addressing the Vicerey in terms tend.ng to facilitate the renewal of friendly communienti,. between the British Government and His Highness. . “ At the termination of this, Major Sandeman s firet mission to Khelat the Govemmct of India determined to permit that officer to revisit speedily the Court of the Khan, w ; th wider powers, abetter dehned authority, and a military force sufficient to ensure genenl submission to its verdict. ff Only three courses were then open to the Gov r ernment of India. Of these, the first was total abstention from any farther interference in the internal aHans ol Khelat. That course would in our opinion at the time, and our unchanged opinion now, have infallibly prolonged an intolerable and aggressive anarchy upon our Western Frontier, until it was terminated by the annexation of Khelat to the dominions of the Amir of Cabul—a neighbour more powerful'than the Khan, more ambitious, and unfortunately also rhore untrustworthy, more openly unfriendly. The second course involved immediate intervention to the extent of deposing the Khan, and annexing the Khanate to British territory. This course the Government of India had indeed already rejected; but since the rejection of it the prospects favorable to any other course had not been very greatly improved. The third course was that of continued intervention to the extent only of what might be found sufficient to impose peace between the Khan and Sirdars of Khelat, with adequate guarantees for the protection of British commerce, and the tranquillity of British territory. “ Taking into due consideration the partial success of Major Sandeman’s first mission, the desire unanimously evinced throughout Khelat for further and continued intervention on its part, and the apparent certainty that if such intervention were withheld, or suspended, the whole of Biluchistan would immediately relapse into anarchy, the Government decided on adopting the last of these three courses. Accordingly Major Sandeman, invested with fuller powers and a more definitely pronounced authority, was a second time deputed to Khelat, under instructions to use his best endeavours for effecting a complete and permanent settlement of the sanguinary and complicated disputes which were still distracting the Khanate. In order to give further weight to his mediation and more distinctly mark the importance attached to its success by the Government of India, an escort consisting of 1,056 men of tlie Sindh and Punjab Frontier forces was detailed to accompany him. On this second mission, he left Jacobabad the 4th April 1876 ; and eight days subsequent to that event the administra tion of the Government of India was made over by Lord Northbrook to the present Viceroy. “ The present Viceroy having had the advantage, before leaving England, of personal communication with Your Lordship on the general subject of our frontier relations, was strongly impressed by the importance of endeavouring to deal with them simultaneously,as indivisible parts of a single Imperial question mainly dependent for its solution on the foreign policy of Her Majesty's Government, which is the ultimate guardian of the whole British Empire, rather than as isolated local matters. From this point of view, and bearing in mind the ambiguous and unsatisfactory character of our relations with Afghanistan, it had been His Excellency's intention to depute a confidential Envoy to the Court of Cabul via Candakr; in and about which locality the Afghan population is most friendly to the British Government. Ibis Envoy, in addition to other amicable communications suggested by a desire for the im provement of our relations with that State, and the better definition of the mutual obligations at pie sent existing between its Government and our own, would have been instructed to explain frankly to the Amir our exact position in regard to Khelat, and the steps which had been, or might be, rendered necessary for the protection of British interests on our Western Frontier. The execution of this project was however rendered impossible by the instructions which + a ^ ieat .y . )ee ^ issued to Major Sandeman during His Excellency's journey to India; aid ie ’oeioy, in these circumstances, immediately recognized the expediency of supporting and au a J°i an etnan in the discharge of his difficult and important task. “The history of Major Sandeman's second mission to Khdat is recorded in the annexed repoi s rom la officer to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. At the iT en 16 1 l e ' en ^ eie( d Khelat a large number of caravans had assembled in Sindh, and xvue leie awai mg t le ic-opening of the great Western trade route through the Bolan P^s. Advantage was promptly taken of the truce in the civil war, and the friendly disposition of f R ° ns v/ r rou ^b as well as of the special means of protection afforded by the strong Z-nnJh aC A C ° mpamed Ma d or Sandeman’s mission, to pass these caravans safe v a • J 3 y p . , ° a ?'

But so wide and deep had become the alienation between them and the Khan, that many of them declared to that the country could only be pacified, either by the deposition of His Highness and the installation of a new ruler under the direct protection of the British Government, or else by this Government openly assuming to itself the sovereignty of the whole Khanate—an arrange- ment which they appeared disposed to urge on our adoption. The Khan on his part evinced, at first considerable reluctance to meet the British Envoy. This reluctance appeared to be partly attributable to a not unnatural sentiment of personal humiliation at having to meet a H s rebellious birdars who had already joined Major Sandeman’s camp, and with whom that officer had first placed himself in communication, partly also to a fear of treachery on their part, and partly perhaps by mistrust of the policy of the British Government towards himself, ihe tact and firmness of Major Sandeman, however, overcame all these obstacles, and on the i of May last the Khan arrived at Mustang, where the British Envoy had pitched his camp and assembled the leaders of the Brahui tribes. Major Sandeman’s conduct in the negotiations which followed commands our warmest commendation Although hitherto regarded throughout Khelat chiefly as the stray advocate a. ic cause of the disaffected Sirdars, he succeeded in rapidly winning the confidence of the Khan witheut losing that of the Chiefs. With great judgment, he threw upon a body of arbitrators nominated by the two parties, the difficult and invidious task of deciding between their rival claims; skilfully reserving to himself the advantageous position of an impartial adviser to both parties m the dispute, rather than that of a judge. He brought his m uence to hear, with excellent effect, on the wild tribesmen, who seem to have followed his advice with unlimited trust; he calmed their apprehensions; he judiciously upheld the posi- tmn ot the Khan ; and thus, by dint of impartial honesty of purpose, by well directed sympathy, and unfailing patience, he persuaded both His Highness and the Sirdars to meet each other halt way, m a rational and amicable spirit. Finally, having by such means reduced their lespective claims and grievances into an intelligible shape, and narrowed them to a practical issue, Majoi Sandeman effected between them a comprehensive settlement of their disputes, on terms which were welcomed by the disputants on each side as mutually satisfactory. The instrument embodying these terms of reconciliation was drawn up at Mustang on the 13th July, and read out formally in Durbar. In it the Sarawan and Jalawan Sirdars de clared their submission and allegiance to the Khan according to f ancient rule and custom:’ the Khan, on his part, restored to them their c ancient rights and privileges/ and promised to treat them with every kindness and consideration so long as they continued loyal and faithful to the Khelat Government. Details connected with the nomination of certain Sirdars to be Chiefs of tribes, grievances arising from the confiscation of lands, &amp;c., were also settled in this document; and assent given to measures for the protection of the Bolan Pass which had been previously arranged by a provisional instrument executed on the 3Uth of June. The Khan and Sirdars, moicover, made a solemn pledge to forget the past, and to avoid all hostilities against one another until after referring any future grounds of dispute to the British Government for its decision. ‘ We do heartily agree/ they declare, ‘ to aid to the best of our power in keeping open the trade routes, to preserve the peace of the country, and we swear we will do nothing to violate this our written agreement of peace. This our first agreement we make to the British Government as a record of the terms of peace made between us, and to which we have affixed our seals.’ “ In making his final report to us, Major Sandeman reviewed with just satisfaction the results of his mission. But he did not conceal from himself, or from us, the necessarily transitory character of the settlement he had effected, if the maintenance of that settlement were to be left henceforth entirely to the unaided powers and uncontrolled impulses of the two parties to it. British Agents had on many previous occasions brought about the amicable settlement of quarrels in Khelat; hut experience had proved the futility of arbitration between disputants who have no confidence in the power and determination of the arbitrating Government to cause its awards to be respected. Major Sandeman pointed out very forcibly that the long civil war, which had desolated Khelat almost without intermission since the accession to power of the present Khan, had for years been deepening between His Highness and the Sirdars a gulf which could not practically be bridged over, all at once, by a mere piece of paper. The continued direct supervision and control of the British Government were, in his opinion, essentially necessary guarantees for the permanence of the results attained by his own arbitration. Speaking, after a careful study of the internal condition of the whole Khanate, and with every disposition to take a sanguine view of the results of his own work, he says—‘ The direct interference of the British Government, acting as a Paramount Power, is absolutely necessary, and must be maintained.’ And again—‘ To make its influence reallv effective for the future, the British Government must state to both sides that it accepts the responsibilities they desire to enforce on it, and will aid them materially, as the Paramount Power, to preserve the peace of the country.’ “Nor was Major Sandeman without good reason for believing that such interference would be cordially welcomed throughout Khelat, as conducive to the interests of the Khanate,( 126 ) tt i f 0 und that both the Khan and the Sirdars looted eidn.

We had then to decide whether we shondnpri onr intervention as terminated by the conclusion of peace between the Ruler and the Ch,d»( Khela • or whether we should accept, with all its responsibilities, the task of prolonged into, vent on which had been so eagerly urged upon our acceptance by all he parties concmd We had to consider, in the first place, all the conditions of the peculiar position we W assumed towards Khelat by the Treaty of 1854. This position, though sometimes ignored k ourselves, had been continually acknowledged and appealed to by the other contracting prt,. We had in the next place, to consider all the practical consequences of the mediation ot 1872. Our interference on that occasion had prevented what then promised to be a decisive trial of strength between the Khan and his Sirdars. By according to the latter a position m which they had never before been formally recognized by the British Government, we had certainly weakened the position of the Khan. Since then. His Highness has never ceased to complain that after having arrested his hand at the critical moment, when he believed himselt able at last/to crush his rebellious vassals, and after giving to those vassals a status prejudicml o is own we had then heavily increased his obligations, whilst diminishing his power; had continued to hold him responsible for the exercise of an authority of which we ourselves had helped to deprive him; and had finanlly punished him for acts which we had left him powerless topreven. We had also before our eyes the history of all previous mediations in Khelat. it s owe plainly that each of them had resulted in confusion worse than that which mediation a attempted to remedy. And we had beneath our hand the strongly expressed opinion o an officer exceptionally well qualified to form a sound opinion on this subject, that a simiarres would infallibly attend his own successful mediation, if we decided on withholding e f®, tinued intervention which he deemed necessary to maintain, and perpetuate, the good e ec o it. Finally, our consideration was duly given to the consequences ^ oreseeI ! Jr an i -ioijJ accepted by the Government of India when framing its Resolution of the 14th Marc ■ That Resolution enabled Major Sandeman to carry out his last mission with unusual pomp ^ publicity, supported by an imposing military force. This circumstance had attracte o the special attention of neighbouring States, at the same time securing to it the specia con^ deuce and respect of all parties and persons in Khelat. To the reliance thus inspired ou o power and determination to protect order, maintain peace, and punish unprovoked aggre.s^ must be mainly attributed the almost unprecedented eagerness of all concerned to follow advice, and accept the award, of the British mediator. We had, therefore, to consider seriously what would he the effect on the Khanate itself, more especially upon thoseo ^ inhabitants and rulers who had unreservedly pdaced their rights and interests in our hands, a what the effect upon our influence elsewhere, of immediately terminating an inteivein which on all sides, we were earnestly requested to prolong, or abruptly withdrawing means of maintaining the settlement effected by our Agent, which the persons who had acced ed it, and were directly interested on its maintenance, unanimously regarded as necessary ^ that purpose. Hie British mediator, himself, had in very emphatic terms recorde 18 berate opinion that a more direct and active interference than heretofore would long e . n , ^ to secure the fruits of his mediation. With this opinion before us we were constrame ^ acknowledge that we could not decline the position thus bequeathed to us by a long cour( 127 ) 0n 'y P°»er i Mi: ^felaiJ 1 is mm riDce j he sjj^i: ' u t wiisiierjlu Wel ! over then, |:' Jf^e British^ Pis Esce]lener|; ttovlateljfitii ahe me belies | reign Power, kii lv welcomd ^ oB of repose,or® troyed bjMtn; eady being W month of Sepfe; o decide whetitm: ince by alltkp of on,t by mnc promised to lei e to the lateajE ih ness i adieu e vassals a state P linishinghispi; winch we o©!®' e had left hii^' ialto strongly^ ( n this snhjed)^ 1 ipew'i' consequencK» lolution of tt (1 ^ jst mis 81011 ’ circumsta^ mesecurin?^ ) the rel® 8 J .m till ;, t j T un&lt;«, Tlix^i *4iM% enip 11 ’ 11 .nte#;', yeti* 1 '*' antecedent circumstance, without thereby incurring the grave responsibility of deliberately plung ing into renewed bloodshed, and interminable anarchy, a neighbouring and a friendly State wdiich had urgently appealed to us for timely rescue from those evils. a Whilst, therefore, we were fully alive to the difficulties and responsibilities of the permanent intervention advocated by Major Sandeman, we could not disguise from ourselves the greater difficulties and responsibilities of renouncing the position in which the success of his mediation had conspicuously placed us. Moreover, we were also of opinion that the highest and most general interests of this Empire (interests no longer local but imperial) rendered it necessary to place our relations with Khelat on a much firmer, more durable, and more intimate footing than before. Whatever may have been the personal disinclination of this Government, in times past, to exercise active interference in Khanates beyond our border, it must now be acknowledged that, having regard to possible contingencies in Central Asia, to the profound and increasing interest with which they are already anticipated and discusssd by the most warlike populations within as well as without our frontier, and to the evidence that has reached us of foreign intrigue in Khelat itself (intrigue at present innocuous, but sure to become active in proportion to the anarchy or weakness of that State and its alienation from British influence), we can no longer avoid the conclusion that the relations between the British Government and this neighbouring Khanate must henceforth he regulated with a view to higher and more imperial objects than the temporary prevention of plunder on the British border. But, indeed, the experience of late years is no less conclusive that even the permanent protection of British trade and property equally demand a more energetic and consistent exercise of that authority which we are now invited, by its Euler, its Chiefs, and its people, to exercise in Khelat. “ But although we have not shrunk from accepting and assuming the responsibilities we inherit from the mediation of 187£ and the armed mission of Major Sandeman, it has not appeared to us necessary or desirable to push intervention to the point recommended by that officer. We learned by one of his latest reports to us that Major Sandeman had already given his sanction to a code of procedure issued by the Khan for the guidance of the Sirdars and Naibs in the civil administration of Khelat; and that this code involved a constant and minute interference on the part of the British Agent in the civil and criminal administration of that State, which seemed to us in the highst degree unadvisable. As therefore we were unable to ratify the sanction given by Major Sandeman to this code, or to concur unreservedly in the whole line of policy advocated by him, we deemed it expedient, before finally determin- i no &gt; the permanent character of our future relations with Khelat, to place Major Sandeman fully and confidentially in possession of our views. It appeared to us that this object could be effected better and more promptly by personal communication than by official correspondence. We were also of opinion that as our adoption of the general basis on which Major Sandeman had, with our entire approval, succeeded in placing our relations with the Khanate would necessitate the retention, for some time at least, ot his escoit m Ixhelat, it was desnable that we should have, as soon as possible, the opinion of a more experienced military officer as to the safety and distribution of the troops. u Accordingly, whilst withholding our official reply to Major Sandemaffis abovementioned report, we deputed Colonel Colley, in accordance with the suggestion of the Viceroy _ (that officer 5 being His Excellences Military Secretary and an officer of political as well as military experience^more especially in regard to the management of frontier tribes and troops), to pro ceed to Khelat in an unofficial capacity as the bearer of communications from His Excellency to the Khan and Major Sandeman respectively. We anticipated great advantage to the public interests from the opportunity thus afforded to Major Sandeman of learning our views in complete detail from an officer in the Viceroy's personal confidence. Our anticipations have been justified by the result. In personal communication with the Military Secretary, Major Sandeman was able to withdraw from the position which he had assumed in issuing his new Code of Civil Procedure for Khelat. He wisely arranged that it should be tieated as a tempo rary document pending the signature of a treaty which should define the obligations we assumed and the completion of a new and more complete Code based upon them. Colonel Colley carried out his mission with care and judgment, and in a manner which merits our warm acknowledgments. In concert with him, Major Sandeman was enabled to lay before the Khan the draft of a Treaty framed in general accord with our wishes. It laid down the tuture rela tions between the two Governments in a sense favorable to Khelat, and calculated to promote the true interests of both. The Khan, with many expressions of gratitude, agreed provisionally to this Treaty after certain additions and alterations were made by himself, and he at once commenced his arrangements for meeting the Viceroy at Jacobabad early m December, with a view to its formal ratification. “ The text of the Treaty thus signed by the Viceroy and His Highness in private Durbar at Jacobabad on the 8th of December last, is annexed to this letter. The first three Articles of this Treaty renew and re-affirmthe Treaty of 1854, whereby the Khan agrees to oppose the enemies of the British Government, to act in subordinate co-operation with it, and to abstain from entering without its permission into any negotiation with other States : the Ejitish Government on its part agreeing to respect the independence of Khelat, and to aid the Khan,( 128 ) in ease of need, by such means as it may deem expedient in the maintenance of his authority, and the protection of his tern ory from externa attack. By the «l, and Antilles of the Treaty of 1876 we re-establish our Agency at the Court of the Khan, lnd authorise our Agent to use his good offices for the settlement of any serious dispute bet,v„ His Highness and his Sirdars. Failing the settlement of it by that means, the Khan irillmH. our consent submit any such dispute to the arbitration of the British Agent, accepting, J:;i j faithfully executing, the Agent’s award. « The 6th Article embodies that part of our present arrangements with Khelat, which mor? than any other, as Your Lordship will readily understand, required our careful preliminary consideration. Had the question before us in connection with this Article been whether we should now, even in compliance with the concurrent desire ot the Khan, the Sirdars and the tribes, introduce British troops into the Khanate, we might have hesitated before assenting to such a measure. But the troops of the British Government weie already in Khelat, where their presence was cordially welcomed by the inhabitants of the country. The value of it in giving* weight to the counsels of our .Envoy, and security to the peace of the population, had been tested and significantly proved by restored political harmony, revived agriculture, umnolest- ed trade, reconstructed villages. What, therefore, we had now to decide was whether we should withdraw these troops, well knowing that their withdrawal would weaken the position of our Envoy, discourage the hopes, and perhaps irretrievably alienate the confidence, of a population which recognized in their presence the only practical guarantee for its continued peace and future prosperity. Even before the signature of the Treaty, these troops had ceased to perform the part of a mere military escort to the Envoy. They had, with the cordial con currence of the Khan, and with the best possible effect, been located in various parts of the country where the presence was deemed most conducive to its permanent pacification or the protection of the re-opened trade routes. The security of the troops themselves had been care fully considered. After consultation with Colonel Colley, Major Sandeman had recommended that any occupa-tion of the mountains and defiles of the Bolan should be avoided; but had selected two points of military as well as political importance—Quetta and Mitri; where the troops would be amidst a friendly, peaceful, and industrious population in open and well cultivated districts, free from any risk of being compromised, or provoking collisions or complications. Meanwhile, there could be no reasonable doubt of the Khan’s personal inability, for the present at any rate, to enforce his newly re-acknowledged authority without at least some show of material support from the British Government. “ Under all these circumstances, we deemed it wise to give practical effect to an arrange ment contemplated by the Treaty of 1854, and completely in accordance with the provisions and intentions of that Treaty; an arrangement obviously required by the present condition of Khelat, and the interests of the Indian Empire so far as they are thereby affected. “The subsequent Articles of the Treaty of 1876 provide for the construction of lines of railway and telegraph; and in pursuance of this provision we have already, in concert with the Khan, made temporary surveys for a future line of railway from Sukkur to the Bolan Pass, and commenced preliminaries for the construction of a telegraph line from Jacobabad to Mur, diverging thence to the town of Khelat on the one side, and Quetta on the other. Finally,it will be seen that to aid the Khan in a more efficient fulfilment than heretofore of the obliga- , m ?

For military as well as political reasons Quetta bad been selected in preference to Khelat for the head-quarters of this force. It offers an exceptionally strong military position, a small hill rising in the middle of a wide open plain, well watered and in the midst of a district abounding in supplies, a position almost unassailable if occupied by troops armed with the most improved modern weapons, and which a small force could hold for any required time against vastly superior forces. It is an important strategical position, commanding the richest and most important valleys of upper Beluchistan, as well as the great trade routes both through the Bolan -and to Khelat. The surrounding population is peaceful and industrious, retaining the most friendly recollections of our former occupations, and welcoming the arrival of the troops as the security for peace and prosperity. It was not considered advisable to locate troops in the Bolan Pass itself, isolated as they would he in a barren and mountainous district in immediate contact with the wild and turbulent tribes where their presence could hardly fail to bring about accidental collisions and complications, and their safety might be seriously compromised. But another open and secure position was selected at Mitri at the south-end of the pass, covering the rich plains of Cutchee, connects Jacobabad with Quetta, and whence the pass could be patrolled if necessary. “ One of the principal objects assigned to Major Sandeman in his missions into Beluchis tan was the opening of the Bolan Pass. The arrangements made for that purpose are detailed in the accompanying papers. For reasons given above it was not considered advisable to place troops in the pass, but was thought preferable to depend on arrangements made with the tribes along the pass. Under arrangements made by Major Sandeman and agreed to by the Khan and the Sirdars, the tribes along the road receive as of old a share of all duties levied on goods passing through. In the protection of the pass a number of men of each tribe are enter tained, and dispersed in posts along the pass, whence they patrol the pass and furnish escorts to caravans. We believed it to be wiser thus to interest the tribes themselves in the protection of the Pass than that the Khan or ourselves should attempt to hold it by force. The general arrangements for the security of the Pass were placed in subordination to the Khan under Mullah Mahomed, the most influential of the Brahui Chiefs, and we have a not unimportant guarantee for his good faith in the fact that Mitri, his principal town and richest district, is occupied by our troops. “It was considered advisable that Quetta should be occupied by a detachment consisting of a mountain battery, a regiment of infantry, and a squadron of cavalry, from the Punjab Frontier Force ; whilst another detachment of a mountain battery, a regiment of cavalry, and a wing of in fantry from the Sind Frontier Force should be temporarily stationed at Mitri, with detachments along the foot of the hills as a check on the raiding propensities of the Murri and Bugti tribes. There were obvious objections, however, to leaving troops in permanence at the latter place, inasmuch as it is said to be unbearably hot and feverish in the summer months. It was consequently decided that the main portion of the force detailed for duty at Mitri should he withdrawn to Jacobabad during the hot months of the year, leaving a chain of posts only to watch the hills. In connection with the general arrangements at Quetta and Khelat, we deemed it fitting to sanction the establishment of dispensaries at those places. “In laying these arrangements before Her Majesty’s Government, we are not unmindful that our relations with the Murri and Bugti tribes have hitherto formed the groundwork of much of that divergence of policy between the Sindh and Punjab officials which has to some .extent crippled our action on the frontier. Your Lordship is already aware that the raids of these troublesome tribes on our own border have given rise to many of our past misunderstand- ino's with the Khan. Nominally they are subjects of Khelat, and they lie within the geogra phical limits of Beluchistan. Yet no Khan has ever been able to exercise any really effective control over them: and his own provinces have suffered more from their inroads than any portion of British territory. The attempt to compel the Khan to do what was not practicable, and to hold him to the letter of the Treaty of 1854, has, we believe, been a source of weakness in our past policy. We have therefore resolved to adhere, for the present, to the system adopted by us in 1875, and to continue our dealings with these tribes independently of the Khan. We shall continue the allowances to them which we have paid since that year; we shall as hereto fore encourage them to take service in the ranks of our frontier police, but we shall repress by- force any outrage which they may dare to commit on British territory. Their power for evil will have been much lessened by the establishment of a settled government under British influence in their rear, where formerly, amidst the contending factions, they were sure of sympathy and refuge. “It only remains for ns to add that the Khan of Khelat and his Sirdars reached Delhi on file 25th of December. It was the first occasion on which the majority of the Chiefs and attendants had left their homes to visit British territory. They expressed with enthusiasm their surprise and admiration on beholding the railways, telegraphs, and other signs of a peace ful civilisation which they saw on their way to Delhi, and their gratification at the kindly reception given to them. We may say, briefly, that the good effect of this visit on both the Khan and^his Sirdars has exceeded our anticipations. They had never before witnessed the power of the British Government. For the first time they realised its strength, and the bene-( 130 ) ^ocltbn^f thrKhanlnd h hfstrrSV q Assemblage at Delhi will bear good (mitt ^ future relations witli Ivhelat. , . . . „ In conclusion we submit to Your Lordslup the Resolution we have issued regarding«,« . i 1 m - nr Saudeman as Agent to the Governor-General in Beluehistan, and the appointment of Ma ]0 . _cl therew ith.

An important mrt of our frontier will no longer be harassed by mistrustful, wild, and dangerous neighbours, and our officers will have Chiefs and populations to deal with, who welcome their counsels and receive them as their best friends. 77 Reply of the Secretary of State to this despatch (No 79 dated 13th December 1877.— After acknowledging the Government of India despatch, Lord Salisbury proceeded as follows:— “ Before conveying to Your Excellency the opinion of Her Majesty's Government on the various questions raised* by these important papers, it will be convenient to trace the progres- sive steps by which the Government of India after, m 1873, bieaking off lelations with the Khan and abandoning all attempt to influence the course of events in Khelat, was ultimately led to the adoption of measures which have resulted in closer relations with the ruler and Chiefs of that country than had before prevailed. “It is unnecessary to detail the circumstances which in 1873 necessitated the withdrawal of the Political Agent from the Court of the Khan, and the suspension of the annual subsidy of Rupees 50,000 paid to His Highness under Article 6 of the Treaty of 1854. It is sufficient to say that the Khan's indifference to advice, his evasion of all measures necessary for the peace of the Sind frontier, and his neglect to make arrangements for the suppression of outrages committed on British traders passing through his territories, and particularly through the district of Lus Bey la, left the Government of India no alternative. “ The policy of the Government of Your Excellency's predecessor at this time was very clearly set forth in the instructions which were conveyed to the Commissioner of Sind, under date the 11th July 1873. ‘ His Excellency in Council,'it was said, ‘ concurs with you in opinion that no interference should, for the present, be exercised by Government in the internal affairs of Khelat. The relations between the Khan and his nobles should be left to adjust them selves. No advice as to their future course of action need be given to either party; but the course of events should be carefully watched, and every effort made to obtain the earliest and most accurate intelligence of all that passes. The obligations of the Khan, under the treaty, to protect trade and secure the peace of the frontier, remain unaffected by recent events, aud I am to request that, in formally communicating to His Highness the determination of Government to with hold the subsidy, you will, at the same time, distinctly inform him that, in the event of any disturbances occurring on the frontier, the British Government will be compelled to take its own measures for preserving order, and further that, if satisfaction is not afforded by the khau for the outrages committed in Lus Beyla, it will be necessary to exact reparation in such manner as the British Government deems most suitable;' again, with reference to the Murri aud Bugti tribes, who had been heretofore treated as subjects of the Khan:‘If the khan does not assume a more friendly attitude within a reasonable time, and the state of affairs in Khelat does not improve, it will be necessary to make arrangements for the protectiono trade direct with the tribes;' and, lastly, as regards the outrages in Lus Beyla: ‘in the even of the Khan s failing to restore order, and after due warning has been given to him of t e consequences of his neglect, the Sind police should make every effort to arrest Nowsherwan Chootah and Dewriah Bundijo, witn their gang. The responsibility of punishing these men rests of course with the Khan ; but if he should be unwilling or unable to assert his authority, measures must be taken independently of him for the protection of the lives and property ot our traders. r xr ^ erefore ’ earnestly desiring to abstain from interference in Khelat affairs, Lor Northbrook s Government clearly recognized that, in circumstances only too likely to occni very decided measures might be forced upon them which could scarcely fail to assume a pun tive character, and might be expected to permanently affect the relations between the hidiai Government and that of the Khan.

Outlie 8th February 1874 the Commissioner in Sind submitted to the Government of India proposals for coercive action against the Murri tribe, whose Chief showed no disposition to comply with repeated demands to proceed to Jacobabad, or make restitution of property which had been plundered by his tribe from caravans passing through the Kham’s district of Kutchee. On the 17th of the same month the Khan’s dominions were described by the Commissioner as being in such a state of insecurity that Government messengers could not pass down the principal thoroughfare without being subjected to murderous outrage. On the 10th March following, Sir W. Merewether reported that a party of 200 armed men of Sassoolee-Brahui tribe, subjects of the Khan, had crossed the British border into the Shikarpoor Collectorate, and forcibly carried off certain slaves who had taken refuge in British territory; in his opinion the inaction of the Khan and absence of restraining power over the action of his subjects, rendered it necessary that His Highness as well as the whole country should be shown that while the Government of India had no desire to interfere in the internal relations of the State of Biluchistan, it would immediately resent any act that at all affected the British possessions; and he considered that if the outrages which had been committed were not promptly and severely met, any of the numerous petty Chiefs along the border might follow the example of the Sassoolees, and make it necessary for the protection of British subjects that a strong force should be stationed along the whole line down to the sea. He therefore recommended a mili tary expedition to Khelat, the objects of which should he to enforce redress from the Khan, to re-establish order and proper rule in the country, and to provide that the rights and privileges of all should be guarantfed for the future. “ The orders of the Government of India on these proposals were communicated to the Commissioner on the 9ti.i October lb74. Lord Northbrook’s Government did not deem it advisable to have recourse to armed intervention with a view to the settlement of the affairs of Khelat. The attitude assumed by the Khan appeared to them to result move from want of power to control his subjects than from hostilities to the British Government. If they were to intervene in force to support his authority, it would be necessary to enquire into and guarantee the rights of those whose alleged grievances had driven them into what might possibly be a justifiable rebellion. On the other hand, if the Khan were removed from power, there appeared to be no one in Khelat who had any prospect of ruling with greater success. They were of opinion that even the Sirdars were divided among themselves, and appeared to have no aim in common, except raiding and plundering. There seemed to he no recognized or dominant party in the State on whose influence we could reckon in re-establishing order. Moral and material support had been freely accorded to the Khan. Further than this His Excellency in Council was not prepared to go. The objects which the Government of India chiefly desired to secure were, first, the prevention of plundering and outrage within or near the British frontier; and second, the safe transit of trade. The latter object could scarcely be looked for while anarchy was so universally rampant in Khelat; it might, however, to some extent follow the re establishment of peace and order on the frontier. No raid having occurred since that by the Sassoolee-Brahuis, the Government of India did not see in the existing state of things on the frontier any necessity for an armed demonstration to deter the tribes from committing outrages within the British border. The policy of endeavouring to deal with the frontier tribes^entirely through the Khan, and of giving them to understand that they were regarded solely as subjects of His Highness, had failed after long and patient trial. His Excellency in Council was therefore of opinion that the time had arrived for having recourse to the alternative measure which had more than once been pointed out, hut which had been deferred from time to time solely out of consideration for His Highness,—the alternative, namely, of making arrangements direct with the frontier tribes and without reference to the Khan. “Nor did Lord Northbrook’s Government consider that our relations with the Murri tribe need preclude the conclusion of such direct arrangements, or that our differences with i heir Chief were so serious as to necessitate a blockade, as proposed by the Commissioner, which, in the opinion of many competent judges, would entail more hardship upon our own subjects than upon the Murris, would involve a rupture with some of the minor Chiefs of the tribe, who were by no means unfriendly to us, and would necessitate a strong reinforcement of the troops on the border. His Excellency in Council preferred, in the first instance, to endeavour to bring about an amicable settlement by means of a deputation of a party of Sind and Punjab officials to the Murri hills, with powers to arrange the necessary measures with the Murri Chief, to explain to the tribes our desire for peace on the frontier and protection to trade, to carry out the details of arrangements previously sanctioned for the entertainment of tribal levies, and generally to endeavour to effect an adjustment of intertribal quarrels, and secure the safe transit of caravans. “ Before taking steps to carry the above orders into effect, the Commissioner in Sind again addressed the Government of India in support of his own views. He once more advocated an armed expedition to Khelat. He pointed out that, though nothing on so extensive a scale as the Sassoolee inroad had lately occurred, repeated acts of violence had been com- mitt-d on British by Khelat subjects; that not only was no redress obtainable from the ruler of the country, butAhat the heads of villages and the villagers themselves in Khelat territory. ( 132 ) had beo-un to adopt amost insolent tone ; and that serious injury to the interests of theBriti* Govemment must follow on the increasing state of disorder into which the Khelat State h 1{1 Mien He further argued that, unless something were speedily done the Sirdars, becoming desperate would adopt their own measures tor their individual interests, totally regard!® „( eaeh other and the general government of the country', while their followers would break loose, r d anarchy and thfwMesf confusion would fill the land; that there would be no i™ Uo ’ plundering^and outrage near the British border, and tiade would he utterly unprotected as it passed through Biluchistan. “ Neither this representation, nor personal communication with the Commissioner in Sind, induced any modification in the previously expressed views of Lord Northbrook s Government adverse both to armed intervention in Khelat and to coercive measures against the Murris. But as before the possibility of such intervention becoming necessary was clearly recognized. &lt; His Excellency in Council/ ‘ wrote the Foreign Secretary on the 5th January 1875, ‘by no means wishes 'it to be understood that Government will under no circumstances send an armed force into Khelat. On the contrary, the state of affairs may at any time become such as to render it expedient that Government should exercise the general powers it possesses under the Treaty of 1854 of stationing troops in Khelat territory in addition to the posts already located there; or the condition of Khelat itself might become so dangerous to the peace and security of our own territories as to make an armed expedition unavoidable. IVIeanw bile the Govern ment of India adhered to their declared policy of suspension of relations with the Khan, and non-intervention in the internal affairs of Khelat, except so far as was implied in direct deal ings with the border tribes, which had, heretofore, been treated as Khelat subjects. To ensure unity of policy in such dealings, it was directed that Major Sandeman, the Deputy Commis- sioner of Dera Ghazi Khan, should, under the orders of the Commissioner^ in Sind, be the medium of all intercourse and communications with the Murri and Bugti tribes in all their branches; while it was arranged that, in the event of the Murri Chief satisfying certain preliminary conditions, that officer should proceed into the Murri hills with power to make the arrangements previously contemplated. “ The correspondence and orders above summarized were reported to me in due course. The policy determined upon by Lord Northbrook's Government was generally approved by Her Majesty's Government, although, as might have been gathered from the terms of my des patch, No. 91, of the 8th July 1875, the latter were unable to entertain very sanguine hopes that it would suffice to produce the results anticipated from it. “ Meanwhile, the state of affairs on the frontier during the spring and summer of 1875 showed some improvement. Major Sandeman's communications with the Murris resulted in the submission of their Chief, who visited Jacobabad, and in the recovery of much stolen property. No serious disturbances occurred within or near the British frontier, in the imme diate neighbourhood of Jacobabad, and signs were not wanting that the Khan of Khelat had at last realized the gravity of his situation. But the Murri raids on Kutchee continued, and it had become clear that their cessation could not be effected except by a settlement of the pending differences between the tribe and the Khan. The question accordingly arose whether, under these circumstances, the arrangements under which the Murris received payment for service on the Punjab frontier should be continued, and should be extended to the Sind fron tier, as had been contemplated, or whether they should be suspended altogether, as a penalty for the continued misconduct of the tribe in Kutchee. Upon this point there was a diame tric difference of opinion between the Punjab and Sind frontier officers. The views of the Government of India, as set forth in their Resolution of the 16th October 1875, were as follows :—- 1 Ihe Governor-General in Council wishes to bring everv influence which he can exert to bear in promoting peace and good order in Kutcbee, as in other territories bordering on the British possessions. Ihe condition of neighbouring countries greatly affects the prosperity of Her Majesty s subjects, and His Lxcellency in Council cannot be indifferent to the condition of the State of Khelat. But the duties and responsibilities of the Government of India in refer ence to raids committed by the nominal subjects of the Khan of Khelat upon their.neighbours m Khelat or other foreign territory are essentially different from their duties and responsi bilities m the ease of raids committed in British territory. His Excellency in Council does not consider that it would be right to terminate arrangements which have secured the peace of our own border, because our efforts to restore order in Kutchee have not been successful. .... . be e.o sting system of service for the protection of the Punjab and Sind frontiers will be maintained, and this service, in so far as it affects both provinces, will be treated as ® n ®:. . A± Ah . e tnbes t? whom service is given commit anv outrages in British territory or on ritish subjects on the Sind frontier requiring the stoppage of'their service on that side, He service ot the offending tribes will also be stopped on the Punjab side, and vice versa, besides any other measures of a severer kind which the Government of India may find it necessary to take by way of punishment. But those penalties will not necessarily be inflicted, either on the Sind or the Punjab side, upon the commission of raids or other offences in Kutchee or elsewhere out of British territory.'At the same time, however, the Government of India were again compelled to recog nize that, however irresponsible, in theory, they might be for the peace of the districts adjoin ing the frontier, they could not, in fact, allow anarchy and rapine to prevail in those regions unchecked; and that irrespective of the general interest which they bad in the quiet and prosperity of neighbouring countries, they had a special interest in Kutchee, arising from the circumstance that the boundary between it and Sind ran through an open country, so that any disturbance might affect British territory very closely. Authority was accordingly given for the suppression by the outposts on the Sind border of any armed aggression within that poidion of Kutchee commanded by them, and over which their power of prompt action extended. “ The views of policy to which the Government of India had been led at the close of the year 1875 by the progress of events were thus summed up by themselves in their despatch to my address. No. 6, of the 14th January 1876 :— “ First. —That we should afford complete protection to the lives and property of our own subjects, and suppi’ess outrage within the Sind and Punjab frontiers by force if necessary. “Second. —That, while we might reasonably expect our troops stationed in the Sind outposts to afford some protection to life and property in Khelat territory immediately adjoin ing the Upper Sind Irontier as far as their power could reach, we should not accept respon sibility for the protection of life and property in the territories of the Khan of Khelat. “ Third. —That our frontier officers should use their influence and good offices for the promotion of peace and order, and for the settlement of disputes, whether among the tribes of Khelat or between the tribes and the people of Seebee or the Government of the Khan. “ In pursuance of the above policy, and with the view of obtaining that full and explicit information as to the real causes of the quarrels and disturbances, without which their was little prospect of the influence of the British Government being successfully applied to their settlement, Major Sandeman was directed to proceed into the Murri Hills, in order (1) to procure all the information he could obtain respecting local feuds and quarrels among the Murri and Bugti tribes, or between them and the Afghans, or between them and the Brahuis; (2) to endeavour to settle amicably such quarrels; (3) to report on such of them as he might not be able to settle; and (4) to report on the general relations between the Murri and Bugti tribes and the Khan’s Government. Major Sandeman was also to enquire and report whether anything could be done for the protection of trade via the Bolan, and whether a system of fixed tolls could not be laid down, the proceeds of which would go to the tribes interested in the protection of the route; and in respect to all or any of these objects he was invested with discretion to make any arrangements he thought proper within a total sum of Rupees 66,960. Major Sandeman was not instructed to interfere in any way in the relations of the Khan of Khelat, either with his Sirdars or with the Government of India, but in the anticipation of the measures authorized being successful in affording reasonable security to trade throughout the Khelat territory. Lord Northbrook’s Government recorded their readiness, in the event of the Khan showing an earnest desire to co-operate for that end, and expressing regret for what had occurred, to restore the former subsidy and re-establish the old friendly footing with His Highness’ Government. “ Major Sandeman crossed the frontier on the 22nd November 1875, and in the course of a long tour through Kahan, Seebee, the Bolan Pass, Quetta, Mustang, and Khelat, had friendly conferences with the Chiefs of the Murri and Bugti tribes, the Brahui Sirdars, the Afghan Chiefs of Seebee, and Kujjuck, and ultimately with the Khan himself. His mission was so far a failure, in that he did not succeed in settling the disputes between the Murris and Bugtis and Brahuis, or between them and the Khan; but, nevertheless, in the opinion of the Government of Your Excellency’s predecessor, it was by no means wholly unsuccessful. In the words of their Resolution of the 14th March 1876, ' it proved, if it did nothing more, that the advent of a British officer as mediator was most welcome to the Chiefs of Khelat. By all parties with whom lie came in contact, by Murris and Bugtis, by the Afghans of Seebee, by the Brahui Sirdars, by the Dumar Kakar Patan Chiefs, by the Minguls of the Bolan Pass, and by the Khan himself, Major Sande man was received in a spirit of marked friendliness and respect. * * The Khan himself * *. . * .* * * . professed his readiness to comply with the directions of the British Government; at Major Sandeman’s request he received the Brahui Sirdars in Durbar; expressed his willingness to forgive the past, and to abstain from hostilities against his Sirdars, pending the orders of the British Government, and eventually made Major Sandeman the bearer of a letter to His Excellency the Viceroy, couched in submissive terms, asking permission to offer an explanation of his conduct through Major Sandeman, or to attend at any place required to offer it in person.’ “ Major Sandeman having returned to British territory, and sent in a detailed report of his mission, the Government of India had to consider what should be their further proceedings in the matter,—whether they would abandon the task of mediation, or would continue their efforts &lt;o effect a settlement. The question was somewhat complicated by the state of affairs in Khelat at the moment, which was such as to raise doubts in regard to the( 134 ) sincerity of the professions of both the Khan and the Chiefs. Major Sand™*,’, departure from Khelat had been immed.ately succeeded by the J direction of the Khan, of one of the leading Hrahu Srrdais. Hostilities fortbift ensued hetivecn the other Sirdars and the Khan while the Mums resumed their raid, j, Kutchee. On the other hand, sig-ns were not wanting that all parties really desired the inter vention of the British Government, and merchants, owners of caravans collected at Shikarno,, were clamorous for assistance through the Bolan Pass. Phe opinion ot Major Sandan® himself was that there was no cause whatever to prevent his again visiting Khelat, with aeooi promise of effecting a settlement of all disputes, fins view was shared by Colonel Mum the Commissioner of Derajat, to whom the management of Khelat attain had been temporani; assigned. f No impediment/ he wrote, 'presents itself to a fair trial of Major Sandeman’s proposals, viz., to re-open communications with His Highness the Khan of Khelat, as de facto as well as de jure Ruler of the State; to endeavour by firm, yet conciliatory and encouragW treatment, rendered all the more easy by recently acquiied peisonal intercourse with most of the dissatisfied Brahui Sirdars, to bring them to a reconciliation with the Khan; to with- stand firmly the plottings of interested schemers; fearlessly to stamp out factious opposition ■with His Highness' sanction and assistance, beyond the fiontiei line; and to re-establishouv relations generally with the Khelat State on a firmer footing than circumstances have admitted of for several years past / and again, £ our maintenance of an entirely passive attitude would naturally be construed into an abandonment of all interest in Khelat affairs. Kutchee would be devastated by the Murris, the trade routes permanently closed, and the Khan probably driven, in desperation, to seek aid from other quarters. The issues are important. At present we have practically lost our hold over the Khelat Government. Unity of action and treatment can now be secured, and one policy pursued for the whole Biluchistan frontier, from the Pass of Vehoa to the sea, comprising all the tribes with whom we have to come in contact/ Lastly, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab recommended that Major Sandeman should be instructed to persevere in endeavours to obtain the objects already defined by the Government of India. “ Such being the state of affairs in Khelat, and such the views of the officers immediately concerned, the Government of Your Excellency's predecessor decided that a renewed attempt should be made to effect (1) an adjustment of the differences between the several tribes, and between them and the Khan, and (2) if the Khan should show a proper spirit, the re-establishment of friendly relations between him and the British Government, Colonel Munro was accordingly authorised to arrange for a meeting between Major Sande man, the Khan, and his Sirdars, in Kutehee or elsewhere as might be convenient; to furnish Major Sandeman with a military escort of such strength as would be amply sufficient for his protection and dignity; to allow him the services of any available officers, civil or military; and to advance to him from the Treasury such funds as he might need. 'To justify this decision it will be sufficient to state the other alternatives which practically lay open to adoption : these were, (1) total abstention from any further interference in the internal affairs of Khelat, or (2) immediate intervention to the extent of deposing the Khan, and, in all probability, ultimately, if not immediately, annexing the Khanate to British temtoiy. these alternatives may, in fact, be regarded as one, for the temporary adoption of the liistcould not have failed to have necessitated, at no distant date, the substitution of the second. I here can, indeed, be no doubt but that, as stated in the 7th paragraph of your letter um ei lep y, the connection existing between the tribes and populations inside and outside our western bolder is so direct, so closely intimate, that any disturbance of the latter vibrates instantaneously across the frontier; that civil war in Beluehistan involves, not only the closing o oui mam ra e routes across that country, the maltreatment of our merchants who use etn, an ie incessant spoliation of their property, but also an unsettled and seriously unsafe com i ion o ntisi territory extending along the whole length of the important province of - ini !' an f , that ’ 1118 bein ® so ' the Government of India could not remain an unconcerned and nu i spec a oi o occurrences on that frontier.

By hearkening to Major San demands counsels, and acting in conformity with his advice, your Highness will afford the best proof of the sincerity of your professions, and relieve me from the necessity of taking further measures to secure the tranquillity of the British frontier and the protection of trade/ 44 The first result of Major Sandemaw’s re-appearance in the country was the immediate passage of large caravans in peace through the Bolan Pass, escorted entirely by Sarawan and Biluch Sirdars. His subsequent proceedings were not less successful. The Sarawan Sirdars and the Khan were invited to his camp at Mustung. The invitation was accepted,—with alacrity by the Sirdars,—with some hesitation by the Khan, who, however, ultimately proved to be amenable to advice, and reasonable in his demands. Arrangements were agreed to between tbe Khan and tbe Chiefs of the tribes interested in the Bolan Pass traffic for the security of trade; the long-standing disputes between tbe Khan and his Sirdars were referred to a committee of arbitration, and satisfactorily settled and formal declaration of the terms of reconciliation agreed to on both sides was made in open Durbar, and ratified, on oath, in tbe most solemn manner according to Mahomedan custom. 44 Tbe first part, therefore, of tbe difficult and important task entrusted to Major Sandeman was completed, and peace was, for the time, restored in Khelat. But the future relations between the Khan and the Government of India remained to be determined, and upon the shape which they might assume depended, there could be no doubt, tbe permanence of tbe results which had been obtained. The opinions of both Major Sandeman and Colonel Munro on this point were very decided. The former officer, in his report of the 31st July 1876, took much pains to demonstrate the ‘absolute necessity’ that existed for tbe Govern ment of India, in order to preserve the peace of the country, which it had brought about only after great trouble and expense, taking a much more active part in Kbelat politics than it bad hitherto done. He wrote : 4 Both tbe Khan and his Sirdars look to tbe British Government as the paramount power to settle all quarrels and difficulties that from time to time may arise between them, and consider themselves entirely subordinate to it. This feeling is very strong with both sides / again : 4 To preserve the peace between the two sides under the present cir cumstances and difficulties of the situation, the direct interference of the British Government acting as the paramount power is absolutely necessary, and must be maintained. The Khan, bis Sirdars, and civil and military administrators know this perfectly, and have one and all expressed to me their conviction of the entire impossibility of forming or continuing a united or harmonious administration without a continuance of the assistance and direction so lately afforded them by my mediation; hence the mention even of my leaving the country has been viewed by both parties in the State with dismay. But to make its interference really effective for tbe future, the British Government must state to both sides that it accepts tbe responsibility they desire to enforce on it, and will aid them materially, as the paramount power, to preserve the peace of the country/ and lastly: 4 Taking the state of affairs as described by me into consideration, and as I believe them really to exist, it will, I doubt not, readily be admitted that the presence of an experienced European officer (for the present at all events) at bis Court, fully supported by our Government, to aid and guide him in the management of tbe Khanate is essentially necessary, and unless this is granted, I am of opinion the present media tion will not get a fair trial, and the peace of the country consequently will probably not last/ Colonel Munro’s opinion was not less positive. 4 Circumstances in every direction/ he wrote on the 28th August, ‘point to the present opportunity as the most favourable for carry ing out what has been so successfully begun, viz., tbe re-establishment of more friendly relations than ever with the Ruler, Chiefs, and people of Biluchistan, who have all been impressed by our later dealings towards them, and the confirmation and extension of our influence for good in this long-distracted region, for, without the exercise of a firm control over the affairs of this neighbouring State, we may expect a reversion, sooner or later, to the confusion and perils of the past. The discordant elements still exist, and nothing but the maintenance of a firm directing power, such as our Government alone possesses, can prevent their breaking out anew, should an opportunity be afforded. Major Sandeman deduces, reasonably in my opinion, from bis recent experience of the state of affairs in Khelat, that a continuance of tbe control and guidance lately introduced is indispensable to tbe permanent success of his own measures. Without such, there can be no hope of anything approaching to respectable administration in Kbelat, or of harmonious action between tbe Khan and his Sirdars. A withdrawal from the position would, in all probability, precipitate forcible inter ference in the interests of British subjects, and of peace on our frontier/ “Tbe position in which Your Excellency thus found yourself placed was undoubtedly one of serious responsibility. You felt the full force of the considerations 'which had so long restrained your predecessors from active interference. It is a grave matter for the Indian Government to undertake the pacification or the control of any portion of the wild district( 136 ) which lies outside its frontier. It cannot lightly abandon responsibilities it has once ackn»». feS It cannot recede at will from any pos.fon l 4 ha \ 0 „ nce occ 'P led - a»l difficulties of which the chances ought to be deeply we.ghed before any advance ,s made, »iU noTfn nish subsequently, a justification for a retreat; on the contrary they may mate it impossible 'to withdraw from an undertaking of winch the mnt.hty has been recogaizei “our Excellency, therefore, naturally hesitated before sanctioning the continuance of a military force in Khelat. “ The considerations, however, to which I have adverted, and which will always operate to dissuade a Government from undertaking military operations beyond its border, were not really applicable at this particular juncture. Military interference had been forced by the course of events upon the Government of India, and had already taken place The policy of abstention from all interference in the affairs of Khelat had been fully tried; and it had led to a normal condition of rapine and anarchy, in which trade was paralyzed, and the security of our own territories was imperfectly preserved. The mere presence of an Agent at the Court of Khelat had not availed to prevent the commencement of these disturbances; the mark of the displeasure of the British Government implied in the withdrawal of that Agent had been powerless to arrest the growth of disorder. The Government had been, step by step, forced most unwillingly to the conclusion that the anarchy in Khelat could only be remedied by the mediation of an Agent whose decisions should be sanctioned by the presence of a military force. In view of these ascertained conclusions, it would not have been possible for lour Excellency to withdraw from the policy of mediation which had been so formally adopted by the Government of India, and to allow the pacific results, by which that policy had been promptly rewarded, to fall to the ground. In the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, you adopted, under the circumstances, the most judicious course that was open to you. While you accepted the duty of going forward with the work which had been begun, you recognized that the surest mode of preserving its disinterested character, and of protecting it from the suspicions of neighbouring populations, was to pursue it, not only in the interest, but with the hearty and proclaimed concurrence of the Khan. His earnest wishes, indeed, and those of his Sirdars, as reported by Major Sandeman in the letter I have quoted, were not among the least cogent reasons for continuing your friendly interposition. Guided by these motives, you lost no time in giving to y r our renewed and closer relations with him a fresh sanction by the Treaty of Jacobabad. “The Treaty renews and supplements the Treaty of 1854. It pledges the British Govern ment to aid the Khan against both internal and foreign foes, and, as a necessary consequence, provides for the presence of British Agents with suitable escorts within His Highness’ dominions. On the other hand, it binds the Khan and his Chiefs to accept the arbitration of the British Government in any serious dispute which may arise between them. It records the desire of the Khan and his birdars for the presence in his country of a detachment of British troops, and the assent of the British Government to His Highness’ wishes, on condition that the troops shall be stationed in such positions as that Government may deem expedient, and shall be withdrawn at their pleasure. The provisions in respect to the construction of public works in Khelat, and freedom of trade between the two powers, will no doubt bear fruit in course of time, while it may reasonably be hoped that the large additional subsidy promised to the Khan by Article 9 will do much to obviate a recurrence of the intestine disorders of recent years and strengthen His Highness’ position. The increase on the amount stipulated in the treaty of 1854 is considerable, but there is good ground for believing that many of the Khan’s difficulties have arisen from want of money, and that the reduction of duties on goods passing through his territories, imposed upon him by that Treaty, has involved a loss of revenue for which a subsidy of Rupees 50,000 afforded an insufficient compensation. Of all these piovisions, and of Article 10 which promises a further contribution of Rupees 20,500 annually towards the establishment of posts and the development of traffic along the trade routes m His Highness’ dominions, Her Alajesty’s Government entirely approve. • co,1 ^ nu . ec ^ P resence a British force in Khelat having been determined upon in principle, the location of the troops had to be considered. Her Majesty’s Government see no reason to question the propriety of the selection of Quetta, in lieu of Khelat itself, as the lea -quarters o t ie force. It is of considerable importance that no step should be taken which might he construed by hostile critics as a menace to the independence of the Khan. For this reason it is preferable that the small force maintained in his dominions at his request should, i possi e, no e stationed at his capital. The objections that have been urged to tne particular station which was selected are of two kinds—military and political. It is maintained by authorities, _ whose opinion is entitled to respect, that while a small force ill lo i 1S f ia v e ® 1C j^ y. ln a dangerous position, the presence of anv force there at Afcrhants 6 T f 0 ^ 0 ^ slwe to tho Am ir of Cabul, and to arouse the jealousy of the pn L. rp ;3 , the . n ' 1 . htar y question, Her Majesty’s Government deem it unnecessary to j • ’ V, 0 1 j ie y are con tent to accept the judgment of the experienced professional S f her £orm P^. or are in tfie serviee, of the Government of India. But the be on friendlv C * ome consideration. Her Majesty’s Government earnestly desire to aten wffich wbuld aff '? ** A %&gt;' a nistan, and they would be reluctant to fake any step winch uould afford just cause of resentment to either the Amir Shere All or his subject*'o{ st f r W;k tlie presfi^ ^ve bp®i ^ 80 III; } wliiclitktffi- ra sopentoT8tl '^D 1)^1, IS) (i of protect^!; mlyiatlieiste wishes, ioidjis quoted, werfKi uidd hytbi . himakii® i pledges fc i as a aecewg orts witlili 5 to accept |e iweentheiD, It; ■ of a detaclE ’ wishes, 01 e mt may deeif the construe will no dill s additional st &gt;f the infest* i* on the anwiti- belienng W E reduction oi d® ity, has in^ : icientcomp® 3 ® itribationofb t of tafc itirelyapprow , been detent They cannot, however, admit that any such cause is offered by the presence of British troops at Quetta, any more than by the location of our garrisons at other points in the vicinity of the Afghan border; nor can they regard the groundless susceptibilities of the Afghans,—assuming them to have been excited,—as justifying the abandonment of an arrangement desired by all parties in the independent State of Biluchistan, and beneficial alike to British and to Bilueh commercial interests. The presence of British troops at Quetta no more constitutes a menace to Afghanistan than does the British garrison at Peshawur; so long as the Amir continues on terms of amity with the British Government, and abstains from acts of aggression, he has as little to fear from the forces at one place as from those at the other. It is undoubtedly true, that in the event of aggression by the Afghans, a force at Quetta is favourably posted, first, to resist, and afterwards, to punish it; but this incidental result of the arrangement, though destitute, I hope, of any practical importance, can scarcely be regarded by Her Majesty’s Government as an objection to it. It was evident that, as time went on, any apprehension which the Amir might at first have felt in consequence of the presence of British troops at Quetta would be removed, and that His Highness would recognize that the neighbourhood of this small force is, if he he sincerely friendly to the Government of Her Majesty, a support, not a menace, to his authority, and no less advantageous to the interests of his subjects than to those of the Indian Government and Khan of Khelat. Information has lately been received from your Agent in Biluchistan, that the Amir now openly states that the occupation of Quetta has his entire approval and is a friendly act benefiting both Governments by securing the safety of the trade routes and the Bolan Pass, and that he has withdrawn the restrictions previously placed on the passage of tho caravans. It may be inferred, therefore, that His High ness has already formed a just estimate of the policy and motives of the British Government in the matter. “ While making every necessary provision for the safety and the health of the small detachment now stationed at Quetta, you will, of course, carefully abstain from erecting any buildings or adopting any measures which can be held to indicate on the part of Her Majesty’s Government a resolution permanently to maintain British troops in that town. The existing force has been placed there for the purpose of preserving the peace of the Khan’s dominions, the security of commerce in the Bolan Pass and the plain which lies below it, and the safety of your Agent. I do not attempt to forecast the interval which must elapse before these objects can be held to be assured without the presence of a military force in Biluchistan. But no expenditure should he incurred which may constitute an impediment to the withdrawal of the troops, if it should be x’esolved upon at any future period after these objects have been secured. “No settlement of Khelat affairs would have been complete which left undetermined the relations of the Murri and Bugti tribes with the Khan and with the Government of India respectively. Those tribes lying within the geographical limits of Biluehistan are subjects of the Khan; but events have shown that, practically, His Highness is powerless to enforce his authority over them, at all events, to the extent of exacting redress for outrages on British subjects. As Your Excellency in Council observes, the attempt to compel the Khan to do in this respect what was not practicable has led to difficulties in the past, and an immediate renewal of it may not be more successful. It is a matter of importance to consolidate the power of the Khan; and the treatment of a portion of his subjects as if they were independent is anomalous, and can only be regarded as a provisional expedient. But the circumstances which justified this mode of proceeding have not yet been materially changed; and, therefore, your resolution to adhere for the present to the system adopted in 1875, and to continue your dealings with the tribes independently of the Khan, is approved by Her Majesty’s Government. It may be hoped that the service allowances which are paid to them will suffice to secure their good behaviour, so far as British territory is concerned, while with the support now afforded to him by your Government, the Khan ought to be in a position to repress and punish outrages on his district of Kutchee. “In conclusion, I have to convey to you the approval by Her Majesty’s Government of the administrative arrangements in connection with the re-establishment of the Khelat Agency, which were sanctioned in your Resolution of the 21st February 1877. The appointment of Major Sandeman to be Agent to the Governor-General in Biluchistan is a merited recognition of the energy and ability shown by that officer in the discharge of the mission with which he was entrusted by Your Excellency’s predecessor. His new position will, doubtless, be a diffieult one. Surrounded by an atmosphere of intrigue, he must be scrupulous to avoid any line of conduct which might seem to identify him with one or other of the parties in the State, between whom he is liable to be called upon to act as arbiter. It is not less essential that, while never hesitating to advise when advice is needed, he should abstain from unnecessary interference in the details of the administration. Upon the tact and judgment of your Agent, and upon the extent and character of the influence which he may gain over the Khan and his Sirdars, must, in the main, depend the success of the measures reviewed in this despatch. -Those measures are the result of very careful consideration on the part of Your Excellency and your predecessor in Council, and their operation will be watched by Her Majesty’s Government with much interest and solicitude.” • [Political A., February 1878, No. 288.]( 138 ) 78. Construction of Telegraph and Railway Lines in Khelat territory. Telegraph Line from Jacobabad to Quetta, and Branch Line from Quetta to Khelat. It taring been deter, mined, in order to carry out the terms of Article 6 of the Supplementary Treaty to station troops at Quetta and m the vicinity ot Mitn, the connection of Quetta with the British Telegraph system became a matter of essential importance. The main line would pass through the Bolan Pass, and a branch line be subsequently constructed connecting Khelat with it either at Quetta or at some point below the Bolan Pass. The previous assent of the Khan to its construction which the provisions of Article 7 of the same Treaty required having been readily accorded orders were issued for the work being undertaken without delay. The extension from Jacobabad to Quetta was estimated to cost Rupees 72,900 Cash ; Rupees 1,05,700 Stores. Operations were commenced at once and the line was finished on the 17th May. A scheme costing Rupees 525 per mensem for its protection by line Public Works Department, No. 2471., dated 16th gUUlds lldS 1)( 611 Sanctioned, and the July is??. following orders have been passed in the Public Works Department regarding the system of working:— “The Governor-General in Council is of opinion that for military and political objects the entire charge and working of the Telegraph line, Jaeobadad to Quetta, and any subse quent extensions in connection therewith, shall be entrusted to one of the Royal Engineer officers attached to the Sappers and Miners, with a suitable staff of European and Native soldiers as inspectors, signallers, and linemen. “ Such officer (and soldiers) shall for all purposes of military discipline continue under the control of the Commandant of Sappers and Miners ; but shall for all matters connected with the maintenance, repair, and working of the Telegraph line under consideration be under the general control of the Director-General of Telegraphs, who shall from time to time issue to him the requisite instructions, either direct or through the Superintendent of the Division. In political matters, that is to say, in anything relating to dealings with the Bolan tribes, and in fact in all points not connected with technical and departmental management, the officer in question should take his instructions from, and be guided by the advice of, the Governor-GeneraBs Agent for Biluchistan. “ It seems proper that the Jacobabad and Quetta line should be considered as a sub division of the Telegraph Department, and the Royal Engineer officer in charge will, for all Telegraph purposes, be considered as if he were an Assistant Superintendent of that Department. “ The following arrangements with regard to the division between the Military and Telegraph Departments of the cost of the working and maintenance expenses and establish ment charges seems suitable: (a) the Military Department will defray the salaries of the Royal Engineer officer and of the soldiers; (b) the Telegraph Department, in consideration of the work done for that Department, will give the Royal Engineer officer in charge a charge allow ance of Rupees 100 per month, with travelling allowance as for an Assistant Superintendent; and (&lt;?) will give to the soldiers, European and Native, the working pay of their grades (according to the scale authorized by the Military Department), provided that in no case shall such lemuneration to any one man exceed Rupees 20 per mensem; (rf) the Telegraph Department will also bear the cost of all necessary expenditure of money and materials required foi the proper maintenance of the line, and all expenses connected with the offices; (&lt;?) the whole of the receipts shall he credited in the accounts of the Telegraph Department.” An estimate of Rupees 66,300 for connecting Quetta with Khelat has also been sanctioned, and the intention is to construct the line within the official year 1877-78, if funds can be made available.

Location of troops in the territories of the Khan of Khelat. —During his stay at Jacobabad His Excellency the Viceroy discussed with Sir William Merewetber, General Yyse, Commanding the Sind District, and Colonel Nuttall, Commanding the Sind Erontier Eorce, the strength and dis position of tbe troops to be employed in Khelat territory. With regard to the strength of the force and the source from which it should be drawn it was decided to station f 1 Eegiment Infantry, At Quetta ... j 1 Squadron Cavalry, (_ 1 Mountain Battery, to be furnished by the Punjab Erontier Eorce. f 1 Begiment Cavalry, At Mitri ... j 1 W 7 ing Infantry, f 1 Mountain Battery, to be furnished by the Sind Erontier Eorce. Eor command purposes the force at Quetta was to form an integral part of the Sind Erontier Eorce and be under the orders of the Officer Commanding that force. It having been left to the Punjab Government to select from the Punjab Erontier Eorce the troops to he sent to Quetta, the Lieutenant-Governor chose (1) the Peshawur Mountain Battery, (2) a Squadron of the 4th Punjab Cavalry from Debra Ghazi Khan, and (3) the 4th Sikh Infantry from the same Station. These troops of the strength shown in the margin, left Bundiwalli for Peshawur Mountain Battery, 4 guns, 170 officers Quetta in Maicll 1877 Under the COm • and men. mand of Captain Charles. They reached 1st Punjab Infantry which was subsequently their destination In eighteen marches \ substituted for the 4th Sikhs, 651 men. having passed through Bugti-dera, Lehri, Mull and Mitri, and entered the Bolan Pass at Pir. There was a double object in locating troops at Mitri. First, the force would suffice to check the raiding propensities of the Murri and Bugti tribes and second, it would serve as a support to the garrison above the Bolan Pass. But owing to climatic and other conditions it was considered inexpedient to retain a large body of troops at Mitri during the hot season. There was no special shelter available, and the Government of India were not satisfied that troops could be maintained there throughout the year without risk of serious sickness even under cover. It was therefore decided that during the hot weather a wing of Infantry and the Mountain Battery should move from Mitri to Quetta to strengthen the latter garrison, and that the regiment of cavalry should return to Jacobabad and furnish thence such outposts as might he found necessary. It was also decided that the troops employed in Khelat should be relieved annually with the exception for the present of the Sind Mountain Battery. With regard to the authority to he exercised over the troops by the Politi cal Officer in Khelat, it was determined that he should have full power of requisition subject to the usual conditions of the service. The question was also considered whether any modification in the present system of outposts occupied by the Sind Erontier Eorce was called for. It was considered that the Mitri Force would probably be required to furnish detach ments during the cold season at Mull and one or two other points in the border as might he settled by the local authorities. The outpost at Kusmore being( 140 ) masked by that of Suri was withdrawn. The establishment of a new post at Shahpur to be garrisoned by troops from Jaoobabad was left for f uture consideration. The question of the escort which should proceed to Khelaton His Highness the Khan’s return was also discussed, and it _ was proposed to detatch 1 troop of cavalry and 1 company ot inlantiy to be provided and relieved from the garrison ot Jacobabad. Subsequently .it was decided that Major Sandeman’s personal escort should consist of Punjab troops and be furnished fro m Quetta, and that an escort to accompany the Khan ot Kbelat on his retina from India was not required.

Despatch of Sappers and Miners to Quetta.— On the30th April a company of sappers, comprising three officers, six British non-com. missioned officers, and 127 men, was despatched from Boorkee to Shere Shah, by rail, marching thence via Bugti-dera to Quetta. Owing to the lateness of the season they were halted for a short time at Multan; but Major Sandeman having reported that all arrangements had been made for their journey, they were permitted to proceed, every possible precaution being taken to preserve the health of the men. They left Multan on the 22nd of May, arrived atLehri on the 17th of June and reached Quetta in excellent condition on the 28th of June. They experienced no difficulties on the march; and on the contrary met with a cordial reception and hearty assistance from the different Beluch tribes through whose territories they passed. [Proceedings, Political A., July 1877, Nos. 352-372.] 81. Despatch of the 32nd Pioneers to Biluchistan. —In Julj 1877 Major Sandeman’s attention was drawn to the route from Bundiwal to Quetta, and he was asked to put in order any portions whicli wen unsuited for field artillery. He then suggested that the detachment of thf 4th Sikhs the previous relief of which had been temporarily stopped foi political reasons should be changed for a Pioneer Begiment, which conic make the road on its march. Just at this time the relief of this detachinenl at Quetta was under consideration, the question being whether it should k replaced by another detachment of equal strength. Majof Sandeman advisee the despatch of a full regiment, because on account of want of fodder ii winter the cavalry could not remain in Khelat and must be replaced by ar m an ry escoit. It was decided to accept this recommendation and to send j loneei egiment to Quetta, notwithstanding the original decision to garrisor a p ^ace 10 m the Punjab Frontier Force.

The Pioneers reached Mitri on tlie 10th of January and were timed to arrive at Quetta before the end of that month. They w r ere to march slowly up the Bolan improving the road en route and were to meet the detachment of the 4th Sikhs at Mach in the Pass. The total British force present in Khelat territory in January 1878 included the following troops :— At Quettah. Artillery.

Formation of winter camp at Mitri. —In September 1877 it was resolved that as soon as the weather permitted a camp should he re-formed at Mitri or elsewhere in the vicinity of the mouth of the Bolan Pass. The strength of the force was to he 1 regiment of cavalry, 1J regi ments of infantry, and half a mountain battery. The composition of the force, the exact site of* the camp, and the date of its formation was left to the deci sion of the Military Department after consultation with the local political and military authorities. The arrangements were made by the Bombay Govern ment who selected the following troops :— (1.) Half of No. 2 Battery from Jacobabad. (2.) Second Sind Horse from Jacobabad. (3.) Wing of 30th Native Infantry (Jacob’s Bides) from Jacobabad. (4.) 29th Native Infantry from Kurrachee. The date fixed for the formation of the Camp was 1st of November 1877, or as soon as possible after. {From Military Department, No. 8245., dated ZQth October 1877.] 83. Police arrangements at Quetta.— In June 1877 Major San deman represented the necessity of entertaining a small body of police—50 constables and a jemadar—for the watch and ward of the civil camp. He proposed that the men should be sent from Dera Ghazi Khan by the Bugti Dera( 142 ) works were route. He said that a large number of labourers were employed in the under construction at Quetta who require o e \va c re . ^ ^ thefts wt becoming common, and four rifles had recently been stolen from the heart of the 4th Sikhs camp. The Government of India were not m favour of import, ino- a Police Guard from the Punjab, and suggested that the police, if abso- lutelv required, might be raised locally. In this case a small staff might be supplied from the Punjab to organize and instruct the men. Eventually, Maior Sandeman proposed to employ a few Brahui watchmen with the inten- tion of supplying their places hereafter by a contingent fiom the Ivhan s troops, should His Highness consent. His Excellency the Viceroy preferred the employment of Brahui watchmen, but agreed to trustworthy men being selected from the Khan’s force if Major Sandeman considered this course desirable. A Deputy Inspector of Police, a Serjeant, and thirteen Constables were des patched by the Punjab Government to organize the men, and subsequently these were supplemented by an equal body of mounted police whose services were required to assist in organizing the Brahui Guide Sowars.

Azad Khan Of Kharan. —Bor an account of Azad Khan’s early history and proceedings up to the middle of May 1876, I must refer to Mr. Henvey’s note, dated the 21st of that month. On the 29th of May Mr. Taylour Thomson telegraphed from Teheran that the Persian Government had com plained of Azad Khan’s aggressions, and had threatened that unless these ceased within two months, they would attack and pursue him even across the frontier. Mr. Thomson believing that the aggressions in question had taken place in Kohuck, reminded the Persian Government that this district, though now in Persian possession, belonged, under General Goldsmid’s decision, to Khelat. The Government of India fully approved this reply as being in accordance with their views, and at the same time directed that Major Sandeman should report confidentially his opinion as to the present situation of affairs in Kohuk, and as. to the measures which might be undertaken to stop the outrages complained of. In accordance with this order Major Sandeman submitted the following report:— Sirdar Azad Khan Nowsherwani of Kharan is really a subject of the Khelat State. He formerly held jag-hire lands in Punjgur, and to cement his friendly relations with the late aan, iln Nussir Khan, the younger, he gave him his daughter in marriage. The present Khan states that, shortly before Nussir Khan's death, a quarrel took place between the wo, an is hi other confiscated the jaghire lands of Pnnjgur belonging to Azad Khan, u w a - ie exact cause of quarrel was between His Highness and the Sirdar the Khan did not state. ^ , , n j U ' USblr hd ian s death the present Khan ascended the guddee of Khelat, and a once proposed to espouse his brother's widow, but she refused to submit, and it is reported insu yc e um w io allowed her to return to her father who came to Khelat with a large o owm &amp; o e c i er. The insult then put on the Khan, whatever its exact nature, has sunk TTlu r S r m T’ and he has never for ^ iven either the father or daughter, and only the other f ' • X ' A ° ie , lecei pt of the correspondence under reply that he would never willingly to hk wnl Kha \ UnleSS he Sent back his daughter to Khelat, as it was a disgrace accordin&lt;T f n u,! r l Kim&lt;)1 -h widow having returned to her father’s home.

He also vism become. The Atir Loe^dT' A “ ir &gt; -bjeerhe declared he desired I snbiect of Cabul and in ' ' su bmission of the Sirdar, and his proposal to become which he hor ds to A nreCtT 06 V* ™ estlte near Candab to the present day. The Khan of Khelat does not object to thisof allegiance on the part of Sirdar Azad Khan. On the contrary he says he is glad at it as he has got rid of a very troublesome Sirdar, and trusts that some day the Persian (Jovern- ment will punish him for his raids into their territory. At Mustung the other day, when settling the Jalawan and Sarawan Sirdar’s quarrel with the Khelat Grovernment, Sirdar Azad Khan wrote asking permission to attend, with a view to his quarrel also with His Highness being arranged. The proposal was made to the Khan, who replied that Sirdar Azad Khan/s quarrel with him was a family one, and ought to stand over. This was agreed to, and Sirdar Azad Khan was written to, telling him to be patient, and on opportunity offering, every endeavour would be made to settle his quarrel with His Highness the Khan. “ Shortly after the Khan's return here from the Conference held at Mustung, a special messenger arrived from Sirdar Azad Khan with letters for myself and Sirdar Mulla Muham mad. The contents of the letter addressed to me were to the effect that, as the quarrels between the whole of the Khelat Sirdars of Sarawan and Jalawan with the Khelat Govern ment had been settled by me. Sirdar Azad Khan trusted that justice would also be done to him. That Punjgur was his ancestral jaghire, which had been held by his forefathers since the days of Nadir Shah. That not only had the Khan confiscated this estate, but had also killed some of his relations, for whose murders blood-money was due him by the Khelat Government. The Sirdar further solicited that some settlement should be come to regarding the Jalak and Kohuk country as it belonged to him, but had been annexed by the King of Persia. “ This letter of the Sirdar, the contents of which are given above, was read to His High ness, who refused to have anything to do with Sirdar Azad Khan, and repeated the nature of the quarrel between the two as already related. The Khan said he wished to have nothing to do with Sirdar Azad Khan's country of Kharan, which had become a part of Cabul, and that if H is Highness’ wishes were attended to, he desired Sirdar Azad Khan should be told this. “ 1 sent a reply to Sirdar Azad Khan's letter advising him still to be patient, and to try himself and arrange his family quarrel with His Highness the Khan. Were this once accomplished I said I thought there would be less difficulty in arranging for the release of the estate of Punjgur. Intimation of this correspondence was notified in diary for the week ending 7th August. “ Since then reports have been received that Sirdar Azad Khan is intriguing against the Khelat Government with the faction in Mekran opposed to it. Mir Isa Khan, Gitchki, whose daughter is one of the Khan's wives, but who is at enmity with His Highness, has betrothed his son to Sirdar Azad Khan's daughter, and it is reported that Mir Isa Khan intends to retire to Kharan. Already he has sent his family there. This fact was also reported in diary for the week ending 31st August. “ Could the quarrel between His Highness and Mir Isa Khan, who is an influential Chief and the real head of the Gitchkis, be made up, it would have a very beneficial effect on the part of the countrv regarding which I am writing. There is no doubt but that Sirdar Azad Khan has betrothed his daughter to Mir Isa Khan's son with the object of getting him and his faction of the tribe to join him against the Khelat Government. At one time His Highness the Khan and Mir Isa Khan were great friends, and it is quite possible that a recon ciliation between them might be brought about. The other Gitchki Sirdar is Babi Khan, and he has been recognised as Chief of the tribe by the Khan, but as Mir Isa Khan is the real head, the policy of the measure is very doubtful. It has had the effect of dividing the tribe into two factions. Regarding the Khan's family quarrel with Sirdar Azad Khan, and his demand that his brother's widow should return to Khelat, I don't think this can ever be.arranged in accordance with the wash of- the Khan. I believe, however, were the British Government to ask His Highness, in the interests of peace, to allow the family matter to drop, and otherwise to arrange the quarrel with Sirdar Azad Khan and Mir Isa Khan, he would agree to the proposal. The great difficulty would be to induce His Highness to restore to Sirdar Azad Khan the estate of Punjgur, but until this is done, I doubt much if peace can be restored by His Highness to that part of his territory. “ In reply to the 2nd paragraph of the Foreign Secretary's letter, and in reference to Sirdar Azad Khan's claims to Kohuk and Jalak, it is impossible for me to say, with the inform ation at my disposal, whether these two places are ever likely, from their position, to be of value strategically to the British and Khelat Governments. There is one point I am sure of, and that is that the Khan would resign them with pleasure to the Persian Government, but whether he should be allowed to do so, and to exclude Sirdar Azad Khan and the country of Kharan from his dominions, is quite a different question, requiring, in my opinion, the serious consideration of the Government. “ The measures I would recommend being adopted are for the Government to address His Highness, or authorize his being addressed, on the subject of the settlement of the lerso- Bilueh frontier, more specially with regard to Sirdar Azad Khan s raids on Kohuk, Jalak,^ and Punjgur. His Flighness should be requested to depute his Vakil, Nawab Mahomed Khan,( 144 ) to accompany the Executive Political Officer m charge of Khelat affairs, on a mission to Meiran and the Perso-Biluch Frontier. The two officers should be authorized to settle all quarrels between the Kbelat Government and the tribes, or between the tribes themselves involving the peace of the country, and they should be directed to submit a joint report as to’ how they proposed to settle Sirdar Azad Khan and Mir Isa Khan s quarrels with the Khelat Government, for the orders of His Highness the Khan. A copy of this report should at the same time be submitted to the Government of India, with a view to their advising His Hi&lt;4 ness how to proceed in the matter, and they should remain in Mekran until the Khan’s il orders, based on their report, were received, which they should, if possible, put in force. “ The above recorded proposal I discussed with the Khan’s Vakil on receipt of your tele, gram of the 21st of August, and we were of opinion that, although we might settle minor dis- putes between the Khelat Government and some of the Mekran Chiefs by calling them into Khelat, which we have with His Highness’ consent and approval done, we would never come to a thorough understanding with Sirdar Azad Khan and Mir Isa Khan, until we had visited the country and invited them to a conference in our camp. The time we would propose fortbe Mission to start would be early in February, as the hot weather commences there in the begin- niug of April. “ A personal escort ought to accompany the Political Officer deputed on the duty, but its number need not be large. The Vakil says the Khan would give him a personal escort of bis own troops to go with him, and a tribal escort of Jelawans could also accompany the two officers with Sirdars Gohur Khan and Mir Ibrahim Khan in command of it.” J Foreign Department No. 319B.P., dated 15th February 1877. § From Major Sandeman, dated 9th March. In the spring of 1877, while Major Sandeman was on duty at Calcutta, Mr. Brace telegraphed* that Azad Khan and Mir Isa Khan Gitchki had besieged the Punjgur forts, and that the Khan contemplated * Dated 7th February 18/7. sending a force to punish them. The Government dated 15th February. ot India desiredf that the Khan might he dissuaded from this step, and that Major Sandeman, on returning to Beluchistan, should take an early opportunity of visiting Punjgur and settling the matter. Major Sandeman was also permitted J to issue instructions in advance of his return to Biluchistan, making preparations for an early visit to Mekran. Shortly afterwards be left Calcutta, and on reaching Rajanpur forwarded^ letters from the Khan to Captain Wyllie, in which the former consented very reluctantly to abandon temporarily his contemplated expedition. At the end of March Major Sandeman met the Khan at Gundava. He || Agent, Governor-General, Belu- found His Highness utterly averse from a peaceful cbistan, No. 27 , dated 30 th March. settlement. || As the Khan himself wrote^f to His •u Kharita, dated 25th March. Excellency I desire that Azad and Isa Gitchki be punished for their evil deeds, and that they not are their followers be destroyed, and Kbaran and their country burnt and plundered! I do esire 0 give any kind of terms to the said Azad Khan or to any of the others. If they-- no, punished in this way, the Biluchi country will be very difficult to govern, as Major am ernan on si mi a r acts occurring will always desire to make peace. This desire interferes wi h the plans 1 bad about the country, and makes me desirous of leaving all interference in Mekran and Punjgur affairs alone.” Majoi. Sandeman was unable to explain this sudden resolution of the Khan tt- V en P 1 pposuls of reconciliation between himself and Azad Khan. His ! f nfr 11 h ! mself frequently asked for Major Sandeman’s interference, i y admi 1 tted Ins own powerlessness to deal with Azad Khan unaided.

His Highness professed extreme anxiety to abide by the terms of Article Y of the recent Treaty, hut at the same time adhered to the views already cited. Unless measures were taken in accordance with them he would have nothing more to do with Mekran affairs, and would leave the British Government to act as it pleased. He had instructed his Yakil not to accompany Major Sandeman, who, nevertheless, thought that his visit to Mekran should not be abandoned. It may he observed here that Article Y of the Treaty, which the Khan professed himself anxious to respect, provides for the settlement of disputes between the Khan and his Sirdars. It directs that in the first instance the British Agent shall endeavour to arrange affairs amicably. If the British Agent fails to adjust matters, the Khan is required to submit the dispute to the arbitration of the British Government and accept its award. The punitive expedition which His Highness contemplated against Azad Khan was, therefore, in direct contravention of this Article, if Azad Khan is to he considered a Sirdar of Khelat, which, perhaps, is doubtful. On the 18th April, Major Sandeman telegraphed that further news from Gnndava convinced him of the necessity of the Khan being distinctly informed that the British Government intended to maintain its present policy in Belu- chistan, and would not allow him to repudiate recent engagements. Unless this were done there was danger that the Khan would fall under the influence of the party in Beluchistan opposed to the continuance of this policy. After * rr, XT coc , , , . .. some consideration the Government issued* thefol-* * lelegram, No. 825, dated 20th April. ,. , . , ,, lowing orders. Major Sandeman was directed to see the Khan and endeavour to induce him to withdraw his objections, to point out to him that in endeavouring to effect a settlement of Mekran affairs the British Government desired not to weaken hut to strengthen his position, and that in any arrangement made, the maintenance of his dignity and authority would be carefully kept in view. Much importance was attached to Major Sandeman’s personal influence. It was most undesirable that he should visit Mekran without the outward support of the Khan. And if the latter were allowed to attack Azad Khan, either it would have to he admitted that the treaty had failed in its first application, or it would appear to the world that the attack had been made with the connivance of the British Government. In any case, t His Excellency’s telegram dated whatever Major Sandeman did, he was to he qareful 19 th April 1877. to carry the Sirdars with him.f About this time Major Sandeman was severely hurt by a fall from his horse. In reply to the Foreign Department telegram dated 20th April above cited, he explained that his health would not permit of his exposing himself, and that the medical authorities strongly averse from his proceeding to Mekran where the heat was intense. He suggested arrangements which would enable him to meet the Khan of Khelat. His proposals were approved, and it X Foreign Department telegram, was added that the Mekran trip did not press as dated 25 th April. long as the Khan and Azad abstained from hosti lities. I Nor is there much more to tell about Azad Khan except that during the summer of 1877, he wrote to Sirdar Mulla Mahomed agreeing to accept the decision of the British Government in his quarrel with the Khan. He asked what policy he was to pursue towards Persia, and was told in reply to keep peace with all until Major Sandeman’s arrival. He was also asked to furnish Major Sandeman with any information he might get regarding the movements and intentions of Persia in respect to the Busso-Turkish war. In November Mr. Taylour Thomson reported further complaints on the part of the Persian Government in regard to Azad Khan. He had incited disturbances on the Bolida and Mand frontier, and the Khan of Khelat had taken no steps to keep him quiet. The Persian Government had therefore ordered the Kerman authorities to adopt active measures for his punishment. In replying to the Persian Government, Mr. Thomson advised them not to( 146 ) take any steps involving any encroachment on districts situated beyond th recognized line of frontier. Major Sandeman said that his information was not of a nature to enable him to say which party was. to blame, but Azad Khan’s son had written bitterly complaining of the Persians as being the aggressors The circumstances were reported to Secretary of State in despatches No 44 dated 8th February 1878, and No. 64, dated 1st March 1878.

Sibi affairs.—For a full note on the papers in the Foreign Depart, ment relating to Sibi affairs I must refer to a precis by Lieutenant Temple dated 7th February 1877. For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the Cabul Diary of the 8th to 11th September 1876, which showed that Major Sandeman had instructed the British Correspondent at Candahar to brim* the state of affairs at Sibi to the notice of Safdur Ali Khan, the Governor of Canda- bar. Disturbances had been excited at Sibi by Sarbuland Khan, and Major Sandeman recommended that the Cabul Government should appoint Mir Mahomed Khan, to be Chief of Sibi, in accordance with an application which the people of Sibi had presented to him. Safdur Ali Khan referred the matter to Cabul and received in reply instructions to the effect that Sibi belonged to Sirdar Ghulam Mohiudin Khan, Candahari, whose Agent should be asked what person had been appointed Chief of Sibi by the Sirdar. Major Sandeman having been called upon for a report submitted the following explanation of his proceedings (13th November 1876) :— “ The Sibi Chiefs have been intimately connected with Khelat affairs. By order of His Highness the Amir of Cabui, Mir Mahomed Khan and his late brother, Sher Zeman, pro- tected Sirdar Mulla Mahomed of Sarawan and his family during the late rebellion, and afforded them an asylum and lands to cultivate.

His reply was sufficient to show that the old family quarrel was at the bottom of it. He did not pretend that he was elected by the people. In reply all he could say was that he was a fit and proper person to carry on the duty of Sirdar. He admitted, however, that he had an elder brother who by birth under any circumstances ought to come before him. “ From the geographical position that Sibi holds towards Katchi, it being separated from it merely by the Nari River, it is of very great importance that the affairs of Sibi, as hitherto, should be conducted by the officers in charge of Khelat affairs. It is doubtless nominally subject to Cahul, but in all administrative matters connected with it, the authorities there have never, as far as I am aware, interested themselves or taken part, and the Sibi Chiefs have invariably looked for help in regard to them to our officers.^ No orders were passed at the time, and in the following January Major Sandeman prepared a demi-official memorandum from which the following account of the political situation in Sibi is taken :— “ The district of Sibi occupies the north-east corner of Katchi, from which it is separated by the Nari river. It consists of the large village of Kurk and of the town of old Sibi. In side this tract of country there is also a large village inhabited by Kajjaks and the small village of Mall. The inhabitants are all Pathans, and are at feud with each other. I have not been able to discover how this tract of country, situated in the heart of the Khan of KhelaCs domi nions and distant nearly 250 miles from Candahar, came to belong to the Afghans. Geo graphically it is really a portion of the Province of Kutch-Gundava, and belongs to all appearances to the Naibship of Dadur. From the available records all I can learn is that Sibi is nominally under Candahar; that it was given by the late Amir in jagir to Sirdar Golam Mohiudin Khan, who collects revenue from it in value about Rupees 10 to 12 thousand yearly. Notwithstanding this, as a matter of fact the Sibi Chiefs have invariably looked for advice in all matters connected with the administration of their villages to the Political Officers stationed at Jacobabad, who, it was clear, considered the Sibi people m all such matters politi cally under their charge, and they would have shown grave displeasure had they referred their social affairs to Candahar. In short, with the exception of the payment of revenue to the Candahar Sirdars, the affairs of Sibi were managed by the British Political Officers stationed at Jacobabad. “The Sibi Sirdars are dissatisfied with the management of their affairs, and argue with truth that nothing has been done either by the British or the Afghan Government to protect them from Murri inroads. Many years ago the Murri clan captured from them the townships of Badra and Mundai situated in the hill just beyond what is now considered as Sibi territory, and from this vantage ground they make continually raids on the villages in the plains. From their present difficult position they ask the British Government to rescue them. During this cold weather I visited Sibi and enquired into the state of affairs on the spot from the Chiefs and people themselves. All freely admitted that their country was a dependency of Afghanistan, and was in the jagir of the Candahar Sirdar above referred to. They said it was the Sirdar’s practice to send every two or three years to Sibi Sirdar Said Khan Durani (a pensioner of the British Government) now residing at Quetta, who collected the revenue and sent it to Candahar. They admitted that frequently he had great difficulty in making the collections. The Murris, they said, had been at feud with them for many years, and they lived in perpetual dread of their depredations, and so bad had these become that of late years the cultivators often did not dare to visit the fields for the purpose of cultivating them. Examination proved this statement to he perfectly true. I visited the lands near the hills, and found that, although there was plenty of good running water, the crops for want of it were drying up.. I saw magnificent cotton fields actually half-withered simply for want of a little water which flows in a large clear stream past them. « But enquiry proved that other and much stronger influences were at work to account for this state of things than mere Murri raids, and that it was to the former quite as much as to the latter that such a sad state of affairs was due. I found that His Highness.the Amir of Cahul and His Highness the Khan of Khelat bad both a great deal to say to Sibi grievances which were really one result of the late civil war. fihe explanation is as follows . “ It appears that the Amir of Cabul, when the Sirdar of the Sarawans visited him and petitioned him for aid against the Khan of Khelat, had, when refusing active interference, granted him a written order addressed to the Candahar Sirdar of Sibi, referred to above, directing him and the Chiefs to give Sirdar Mulla Mahomed an asylum in Sibi itself. This was done and hence it happened that for the last few years, during which the civil war lasted the Brahui Sirdars made the Sibi village their head-quarters, from which they conspired and intrigued against the Khelat Government. “ q^e Khan at heart was greatly incensed and irritated at this action on the part of the Cabul and Candahar authorities. ' His Highness retaliated on them in this way.( 148 ) “ In most Afghan families there are two factions the family of the Sibi Sirdar i Sno exception to the rule, the Khan therefore at once took the part of the faction opposed to the Sirdar of the tribe and encouraged its head by every means in his power to create disturbances. Information by this means was readily given to the Mains vvheie ibi and Brahui cattle were to be found, and the result has been the very unhappy state ot attains just described by ^ and which I found to exist during my late visit. “ The Khan prevents the people of Sibi from cultivating in the way described, and thus makes the collection of revenue no easy matter. His Highness has by this means revenged himself on the Cabul authorities for giving the Sirdars an asylum m the heart of Khelat territory, and at the same time he keeps the Sibi people in continual terror of inroads being made by the Murris into their territory. The unfriendliness of the Amir's action in thus allowing the Brahui Sirdars to settle at Sibi is proved by the fact that only last year the villages'of Barshori and Kasun Shah-ki-jok were plundered by a party of the refugee Brahui starting from Sibi. “The state of affairs described above was however incidental to the late situation in Khelat itself, and ought, in my opinion, to be dealt with by our Government as part of it. u I would recommend, should the Government of India decide to put a stop to this state of things and to endeavor to settle Sibi affairs, to request the Khan of Khelat and the Amir of Cabul, on account of the part they have both taken in regard to them to aid in doing so. The Amir and Khan might be asked to appoint officers to discuss the whole question in all its bearings with the Political Agent in charge of Khelat affairs, and in concert and communicatiou with that officer to draw up a report for the consideration of the Government of India, containing their joint recommendations for the settlement of the Sibi District and its future protection from Murri raids.' The present situation has, I believe, lasted since the first occupation of Cabul, and truly to the present day prevents all progress and security to life and property in that part of the Khan’s dominions within which Sibi is situated.—(Sd.) R. S. On the 16th of February 1877 Faiz Mahomed Khan, Ali Jan Khan, and Pista Khan, Duranis, Agents of the Amir of Cabul, wrote to Mr. Bruce from Sibi and said that in accordance with the Amir’s order they had recog nized Sardar Mir Mahomed Khan, Barozai, as Chief of Sibi, and they hoped that Air. Bruce would comply, for the Amir’s sake, with any request which the Sirdar might make. They then referred to the settlement regarding Katchi which Major Sandeman had made with the Murris and Bugtis, and begged that arrangements might also he made for Sibi. They also complained that the Kajjaks had refused for the last five years to pay the Amir’s revenue. Alajor Sandeman proposed that Air. Bruce should inform the Amir’s Agents that Mir Mahomed Khan would receive the honorable treatment which had always been bestowed on the Sirdar of Sibi; that every effort would be made to prevent the Murris from raiding on Sibi, and that he hoped to receive definite proposals for the joint action of the Khelat and Oandahar autho rities in preventing these raids. With regard to the Kajjaks against whom compulsory measures were contemplated Major Sandeman proposed that the Agents should be told to refer the question to the Amir, and ask His Highness to address the Government of India on the subject. Under any circumstances it would be a bad precedent to allow the Amir’s Agents to wage war on the Kajjaks who reside in the heart of Khelat territory. These proposals were approved by the Government of India.

The Amir, however, rejected his overtures telling him he was a subject of the British Government. Towards the end of September 1876 Major Sandeman received secret information that the Amir had sent a special messenger to Khelat asking the Khan to inform him of all that had taken place at Mustang. Two or three days after the arrival of this messenger Major Sandeman heard that the Khan was preparing to send the Mustowfi Kakir Mahomed to Cabul with presents for the Amir. His informant warned him of the strength of the Pathan faction at the Khan’s Court and advised him, if he wished to keep the Khan to his agreement with the Government, to interfere authoritatively and put a stop to the Mustowfi’s journey. Major Sandeman, thereupon, visited the Khan, pointed out to him that the deputation of the Mustowfi without the consent of the British Government was contrary to Article III of the Treaty of 1854, and induced the Khan to agree to a reference to the Government of India. He then, on the 8th of October, reported the matter for orders, enclosing a letter from the Khan which stated as follows the objects of the Mustowfi’s deputation:— 1st —He will establish the old friendly relations with the Cabul Government. 2nd —He will point out that the Barozais of Sibi afford an asylum to every disloyal servant of mine and bad character, and to those who commit outrages and then seek refuge with them. 3rd —He wall represent that Azad Khan, Nowsherwani of Kharan, is continually engaged, day and night, in plotting disturbances in my country, with the object of plundering my subjects. 1th —He will bring to notice that one Mahomed Khair, by race a Kakar, resident of Candahar, owes me Rupees 25,000, as he has been my Agent there. He now informs me that he is too poor to pay the money. Major Sandeman was instructed to do his best to prevent communications between the Rulers of Cabul and Khelat pending the approaching meeting between the Khan and His Excellency the Viceroy. The nature of the reply which the Khan sent to the Amir never transpired. But, whatever it was, it elicited a further message from the Amir which Naib Eaiz Mahomed of Mustang brought to the Khan when he ‘was at Jacobabad. This message advised the Khan to temporize with the English as much as possible, and to get from them as much money as he could by asking a high price for each concession made. Its effect was seen in the Khan’s subsequent conduct regarding the money to be paid to him by the British Government. Erom the time of its receipt he began to express doubts as to the three lakhs of rupees being sufficient compensation, though when this sum had been first mentioned it had been accepted with eager gratitude. Major Sandeman’s memorandum continues as follows :— ee On my return from Calcutta to jom the Khan at Gandava, I heard from many sources, some of them secret but still reliable, that the intercourse between the Khan and the Amir had become very active, and was conducted, almost openly, through Syud Ali Khan of Mustang, who had gone to Cabul for the purpose of conferring with the Amir. I believe, were I to send for this Syud, he would confess to having visited the Amir on a political mission at the Khan’s request. “I ma y also note here that Ressaldar Muhammad Amir Khan, Native Assistant, who is a resident of Kandahar, recognised a messenger at Dadar coming direct from the Governor of Kandahar to the Khan who was then at Gandava. “ The deputation also of the Khan’s Commandant of troops, Mosan Khan, a native of Pashin, to Kandahar, accompanied by a small body of the Khan’s troops, was openly discussed, and Captain Scott, when the Commandant arrived at Quetta, was informed of the circum stance, and that he was on his way to Cabul on a secret mission. It was furthei icpoited to me that the Amir had told the Khan, he was not fit to be a Mussulman Prince, as he had sold his country for a lakh of rupees a year to c: Kafirs, and he exhoited him to join him in a religious war against the English, and to cast the treaty and its terms to the winds. Ibis( 150 ) # recommendation of the Amir was strongly supMrted by th^ Khan’s Army all of whon a re Pathans an( i by a few Afghans now residing at his Coui t. At t is time the Khan seems to have he’en carried away by religious enthusiasms and to have yielded to the Amids and I am told that he sent to Sardars Shad! Khan Bangokai and Said Khan Shahwani other Brahui Chiefs offering them any terms they liked to ask for if they would separate themselves from the English and join him and the Amir, which terms, had they accepted them would have entirely upset the recent settlement made at Mustang. In other „ also, } strongly suspected that he set disturbing elements to work, with a view on creatiu el,„ .'iiimlrv. and with the object of upsetting the Bolan Pass arrangeme matters, petty “ In answer to the Amir’s reproach, that he (the Khan) had sold his country to the English it is said, that he replied pointing out to the Amir that if he (the Amir) was really in earnest he ought to give evidence of it by not allowing the then small garrison at Quetta to remain unmolested, and in proof of his good faith, he ought to send a body of troops from Kandahar to Pashin. “ The plan which the Khan, it is said, proposed to the Amir was for the Amir, in addition to sen din o- troops to Pasl.in, to induce the tribes about there, and in neighbourhood of Quetta, to rise ; and on their doing so, he (the Khan) would induce me in a friendly way to ask him to come himself to Quetta with his troops, and to occupy the Quetta Foit j and aftei inducing the English Government, through me, to arm his men with rifles, and repau the fort, placing o&gt;uns in it, he would then ask them to withdraw the British force from Quetta, on the plea that he was himself in a position to defend the country and keep the Bolan Pass open. « This plan, however, entirely fell to the ground. The Brahui Sardars and tribes gave a distinct and decided refusal to join either the Khan or the Amir, and the latter finding matters likely to go wrong with himself in Kabul itself, and with our Government, at last sent to the Khan to say he must cease all correspondence with him, and gave up all intention of creating a religious war, as they were not strong enough, or in a position unaided to act contrary to the wishes of the English. “ The above is briefly what resulted from the intercourse between the Khan and the Amir, and there can be no manner of doubt that the proclamation of the religious war had the very worst effect on the Khan’s mind, as he was surrounded at the time by a most bigoted set of Afghans, almost all of whom are, for cogent reasons I could give, inimical to the British alliance, and for a time, if not up to the present hour, he has been under their influence. “ But nothing could have more strongly or more unmistakably shown what had resulted at this time from the conduct of the Amir in proclaiming a religious war, and the effect it had on the Khan, than the way in which the different Naibs acted. I had the greatest difficulty in getting any help from them for the Telegraph officers, which was chiefly given on my application by the Sarawan Sirdars, who behaved most admirably throughout. They afforded substantial proof of their loyal feeling by joining my camp, and by at once supplying me with seven hundred camels for conveying the Telegraph material; and by their aid I was enabled to push the construction of the line at a rapid pace through the Bolan Pass. “ Captain Scott and Doctor Duke both reported to me that the most disquieting rumours were spread by the Khelat officials, regarding the state of the tribes, specially those about Quetta and Pashin. It was reported to Captain Scott that the Naib of Quetta, on receipt of the intelligence of the religious war having been proclaimed at Kandahar, announced it in Durbar, by calling out to the Mussulmans assembled there, “ Mobarak ho, &amp;c.,” “ I congra tulate you, &amp;c.” “ fhe Naib himself came to Captain Scott, and told him that the state of affairs in the country about Quetta on this account had become so bad that it was dangerous for him to leave nis lines; all of which information, Captain Scott, by going from village to village, found to he quite untrue, and without foundation, as the people and Chiefs expressed to himself the very opposite sentiments, stating that the proclamation of the religious war had been got up by the Amir for his own purpose, and that they had no concern in it. 1 he result to myself has as yet been only extra trouble as exemplified in the conduct of t^e Khan, in regard to Mekran affairs and other matters. These I have reported already, demi- offidally, to the foreign Secretary, and circumstances must determine hereafter how far these acts of the Khan and his officials will require to be noticed by the Government. But it is not my desire to press the matter unnecessarily against His Highness, for the times have been difficult ones for all, and it was improbable, all things considered, especially t ve ie igious influences brought to bear on the Khan, that the conduct of the Amir, iu pro- &lt; aiming a religious war, would result otherwise than it has done. At the same time I felt, knowing t le Khan s character, that my only chance of overcoming the difficulties of the posi tion was y making a determined stand against them, and in doing this, I have solicited the con in net support of the Government, which, if granted, I do not doubt—as the recent excite- 1,1611 ^ su )S1 d* n g fast that I will succeed in doing this and in bringing the Khan to a proper sense o^ ns duty to the Government and country, in accordance with the terms of the newThis memorandum was supplemented by a telegram dated the 10th of May in which Major Sandeman reported that on the previous day the Sarawan Sirdar had informed him of the arrival of a secret messenger from the Amir wdiose mission was to ascertain the true reason of the British occupation of Quetta. Major Sandeman sent for this messenger and carefully examined him. He admitted having come from Candahar to enquire into the proceedings of the British Government at Quetta, hut would not confess that he had come direct from the Amir. He said that the Khan wrote frequently to the Amir declaring that lie had not acted as a free agent when signing the Treaty and that he was ready to join the Amir against the English. His country and all his property had been appropriated by the British Government and 2,000 Euro pean soldiers were in the Bolan Pass en route to Candahar. The Amir had been greatly disturbed by the Khan’s letters and did not know what to believe or Iioav to act. Major Sandeman re-assured the messenger and dismissed him. Subsequently in a khureeta to the Viceroy, dated 23rd of November 1877, the Khan of Khelat wrote as follows on this subject:— “ My friend, Major Sandeman, has also comrmmicated to me the contents of an English letter from Your Excellency to his address on the subject of an intrigue said to be going on between myself and Amir Sher Ali Khan, Wali of Cabul, regarding a religious war to be waged against the British Government. In reply, I beg to state that from the first I have ever looked up the British Government in the light of a King over me., and I have tried to deserve their coun tenance and support, and would consider any such act as the one charged against me as quite unworthy of the position I hold. In fact just after Your Excellency^ arrival in India to assume the office of Viceroy and Governor-General, I wrote Your Excellency a letter in which I stated that the evil disposed and bad characters of this country had ruined my father, his family, and country, and that in consequence his property had been plundered and destroyed. I wrote this to Your Excellency advisedly, because I thought it not unlikely some bad characters might spread false reports about my conduct in the hopes to have me treated in the same way. The result has shown that my fears were not unfounded, as some bad characters have spread false reports about me which reports have reached Your Excellency. “ I trust Your Excellency will be good enough to take the matter in hand and enquire into it. Should the enquiry prove me to be guilty, then Your Excellency may treat me as you think proper, but should it, on the contrary, prove my innocence, I trust Your Excellency will punish the bad characters with death and by plundering their property for having spread these false reports against me, in order that their punishment may prove a warning to other bad characters. Should Your Excellency not pursue this course and have the bad characters punished I shall be disappointed.” It may be mentioned here that in August last Major Sandeman received fairly authentic information that the Amir of Cabul had lately entirely changed his tone in talking of the British occupation of Quetta and the nature of his relations with the British Government, which he now declared to be friendly. His Highness now openly stated that the occupation of Quetta had his entire approval and was a friendly act henefitting both Governments by securing the safety of trade routes and ot the Boian Pass. The Amir had also withdrawn all restrictions regarding Kafilas.

Outrage at Quetta. Murder of Lieut. Hewson, R.E.— About 6 o’clock in the afternoon of the 26th of July 1877, Lieutenants Hewson and Kunhardt went from the Civil Camp to the new Besidency Buildings to re-measure some stone stacks collected by a contractor, named Saiyyad Atta, about w r hich there had been a dispute. While thus engaged they were suddenly attacked from behind by three Pathans. Two attacked Lieutenant Hewson, and killed him on the spot. Lieutenant Kunhardt was slightly wounded on each shoulder, turning sharply round he knocked his assailant down, while the latter was in the act of cutting at him with a sword. Lieutenant Kunhardt then succeeded in making his escape, being greatly assisted by the gallant conduct of Bajpal Sing, a sepoy of the 4th Sikhs, who, though( 152 ) , J -+ 1 , o cm ill nxe ran to his rescue and attacked his assailants. SiiiV V was cut down and killed. While this was going on Captain Scott IXajpal Sing wa ^ off&gt; Hearing the disturbance he rushed to Hie 8 sTo^Xllowed by his men, and taking a rifle with a fixed bayonet from a sepoy behind him advanced to engage the first murderer. He bayoneted him twice and then turning to receive the second murderer ran him through the chest’ The third murderer had fortunately been deterred by volleys of stones from the sepoys from aiding his comrade. Now, advancing at a run he cut at Captain Scott’s head; the latter only partially parried the blow which pene- traded through his pugrec and helmet. The two then closed m a hand-to-hand struggle when the sepoys of the detachment coming up killed the Pathan. ^0min’- the fi-hting three of the laborers belonging to the works were seen fo throw stones at the officers. Two of these were killed and the third, Iw name Balk, was taken prisoner. The impression at the time was that the outrage had been committed by the Pathan coolies employed on the works. It was reported that a number of these had escaped into, the fort where a concourse of suspicious characters had assembled with the intention of hold ing it and of attempting a rescue of their comrades. Mr. Bruce therefore considered it advisable to occupy the fort, and Captain Charles, the Officer Commanding the troops, detailed the Sappers and Miners and a company of the 1st Pun mb Infantry to take possession. Meanwhile Sirdar Mulla Muham mad Raisani, who was on the spot with a number of his sowars, was sent in advance to hold the gates until the arrival of the troops. Porty-four persons had been taken prisoner, and Mr. Bruce appointed a Committee consisting of Sirdars Mulla Mahomed, Raisani, Abdul Wahid Khan, Durani, Nawab Mahomed Khan, Vakil of the Khan of Khelat, and Atta Jan, haib of Quetta, to consider the circumstances of the outrage. On the 29th of July this Committee submitted their report which dealt with the following persons, the remaining prisoners having been released for want of evidence:— I. Maidad, son of Wazir, caste Bazai Pathan, of Saraghar (deceased), killed by Captain Scott, Commanding Detachment, 4th Sikh Infantry. II. Donlat, son of Nawab, caste Bazai Pathan, of Saraghar (deceased), killed by Captain Scott and men of 4th Sikhs. III. Mir Gnl, son of Khoji, caste Lobar, of Saraghar, deceased, killed by men of 4th Sikhs. IV. A Pathan, name unknown, said to he of the caste Esakhail, and resident of Rajjak near Yob, killed by Captain Scott. V. A Pathan, named Ghammi, said to he of the caste Troghar, and resi dent of Torashah, Illaqua Peshin, killed by the men of the 4th Sikhs. VI. Balk, son of Samand, caste Lobar, of Saraghar. Of these six persons the only survivor was Baik whose guilt Mr. Bruce con sidered to be clearly established. Baik had been arrested close to the spot where the outrage was committed. His relation Mir Gul was one of the persons killed on the scene of the crime, and Baik had identified the body. He came from the same village, Saraghar, as the murderers Doulat and Maidad, a fact which he had at first denied. Sheredin, Subadar of the 4th Sikhs, had seen him pelting stones. It was Baik also who gave the first tangible clue showing that the Bazais had been the ringleaders of the outrage, and he confessed to having heard them threaten to murder British officers, and that he had reported this to no one. Major Sandeman fully concurred in Balk’s guilt, and proposed to submit the proceedings to the Khan and obtain his assent to a capital sentence. Balk’s punishment, however, still remains unsettled, for Major Sandeman has since written that the Khan, while leaving Baik’s fate at the disposal of the British Government, had suggested a sentence of imprisonment for life on the ground that the evidence against him was inconclusive. To turn to the question of the motives for this crime and the persons by whom it was perpetrated. At first suspicion rested on the Seyeds of Pesbm,aS ttllnte 'r i' ^ 'eri vnh H [osed inak| f u Pleli| ail | ttlie mto fell, the iutenti; n HrJii^, ‘in Charles, | ■Mrs aiat ) Sirdar M] his sow, is os.

Mr. Bruce’s conclusion^ in which Major Sandeman agreed, was that the outrage had been planned by the Bazais and their followers, and that the outsiders implicated only joined in at the time. The reason why the Bazais were hostile was that their respon sibility for the wanton destruction of Government camels, which had been grazing near the village of Saraghar, had been enforced. A party of thieves had come down one of the Bazai Passes and attempted to carry off the camels. When pursued they killed two camels and wounded a third. Three of the Bazai headmen were then taken prisoners by the Naib of Quetta and placed in confinement. The excellent conduct of the Pathans, generally both Brahuis andBeluchis, formed a gratifying feature of this deplorable outrage. Sirdar Mulla Mahomed, as has been stated, held the fort gates until the arrival of the troops. The Ban- golzai Sirdar, Shadi Khan, on hearing the disturbance at once marched in with his men. The Jalawan Sirdars sent to say that if Major Sandeman required their services they would come at once. Various other Chiefs also shewed much sympathy with Lieutenant Hewson’s death and the dastardly and cowardly way in which he had been slain. To mark their appreciation of Captain Scott’s gallant behaviour the Government of India brought his conduct to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government and the Victoria Cross had since been conferred on him. Finally the Government of India expressed complete concurrence in Major Sandeman’s opinion that the outrage was purely local in its character; that it was not the outcome of any wide-spread hostile feeling, and that it had no evil political significance.

Occupation of the fort at Quetta. —It has been mentioned in the preceding paragraph that at the time of the murder of Lieutenant Hewson it was deemed necessary at once to occupy the fort at Quetta. But before this occurrence the question of occupation had been under consideration with the following result:— Towards the close of 1876, Major Sandeman had succeeded in obtaining the consent of the Khan to place the fort at the disposal of the British Govern ment. Nothing, however, was done at the time. In the following May the Khan’s Vakil, Navvah Mahomed Khan, and Atta Jan, the Naib of Quetta, asked for a private interview which Major Sandeman granted and of which he gave the following account :— “On their being seated, the Vakil asked me if I had received lately news from Cabal. I replied that there were many rumours flying about regarding what was going on there, but I would be obliged by bis speaking out and telling me to what he alluded. “ The Vakil to this appeal announced that it was reported that the Cabal Government and the British Government had ceased to be friendly, and that Mustafi Habibulla Khan, when en route to Peshawur, had been ordered back to Cabal, and that the Amir was so angry he was going to send an army of 12,000 men to Pishin. I answered that there was some truth in the report about the Mustafi. That they were both aware of the Amir having proclaimed a jehad in Candahar and elsewhere, and doubtless this circumstance might have had something to do with the MustafPs not going to Peshawur, but that otherwise British relations with the Amir were unchanged. “ This explanation did not at all satisfy my two visitors. They began by saying the times were very serious, and I ought to think gravely of the position of the British Garrison at Quetta, which ought to be increased to at least double its prsent strength. “ Having in this way prepared by mind for what they were about to propose, the real object of their visit was then stated, which was that the Khan should send a body of his Pathan troops to occupy the fort here and the Bolan Pass. They said the Khan could easily be induced to send his second son, Mir Shah Newaz, to Quetta, who would reside in the fort along with the Khelat troops, and thus prove to the world at large how loj^al the Khan was to the British Government. They repeatedly urged on my notice how little real dependence I m on( 154 ) ii L c* j TVTnlla MaVmmed and Asad Khan, and the other Brahui Sirdars Kb n Cgukai Said Kha n Mahomed Shahi, Junda Kl.an Shahwani, Adadina Kurd ^ others a Uf whom are with me here as they were disloyal to the.r own Prmee, and would prove in the long run disloyal to me. That our only true security was the loyalty of tk( Khelat and British troops, and that if I would only put faith in the Khelat army, and tmtH to hold the Bolan Pass, the Khan himself would be responsible for the safety of every ru^ worth of property which passed through it. “ I confess I was for the moment taken a little aback by the above long address, however immediately recovering myself, I said I did not look upon the state of our relations with the Sr of CabTin th! li^ht 'they did. Far from it, hut 1 said even if the Amir did »d 12 000 troops to Pishin, which I doubted his being m a position o do, it did not follow he was to attack me here. That Pishin belonged to him, and if he saw the necessity for occupy, mo- it with troops, I had no objections. I agreed with the V akil and the Naib, however, that it'was quite right, under present circumstances, for me to he prepared tor emergencies especially after what they had told me. I then assured them that I had already taken every precaution and to be comforted. I pointed out that I had plenty of supplies ready to take into the Port of Quetta, and was prepared to defend it with the British troops now here against the Amir or any one else, who come to attack it. “ In regard to the proposal that the Khan’s sepoys should occupy the Bolan Pass and the Fort of Quetta. With reference to the first proposal, I said that they and the Khan must know perfectly well that the Sirdars would never agree to such a tiling, and that were it attemped, it would certainly result in a disturbance, which event under the terms of the new treaty I * was bound, if possible, to prevent. That tlm Khan had some years ago tried his utmost to hold the pass with his troops against the Sirdars, who had ultimately forced him to withdraw them, after which the pass remained closed until the date of my visiting the country, when with the loyal aid of Sirdar Mulla Mahomed and the other Sirdars I had succeeded in opening it. I therefore could not, under any circumstances, without the consent of the Sirdars, station the Khebit troops in the pass, as doing so would be contrary to the terms of the peace declared at Mustuug. Moreover I felt certain, if I did so, they could not hold the pass for a single day. a Regarding their second proposal, in reply, I said, addressing myself particularly to the Vakil, that he had himself told to Doctor Duke at Gandava, that the troops of the Khan were quite untrustworthy, and would join the Amir in a jehad directly he proclaimed it, as they were chiefly subjects of Cabul, and hated the English, and that moreover the Khan himself had no power over them. I pointed out how impossible it was under present circumstances I could allow troops avowedly possessing such feelings to occupy at the present time the Quetta Fort, more especially as the valley itself is held by the British Force for the Khan’s protection and the safety of the country, and therefore if it was necessary to occupy the fort at all, this duty must be performed by the British troops now here. A good deal of other conversation took place about supplies, &amp;c., hut 1 have recorded all that was discussed of importance. Shortly afterwards the Vakil and Naib took their leave.” After this conyersation Major Sandeman inspected the fort in company with Lieutenant Kunhardt. He found that few people lived in it, and that when the British troops occupied Khelat in 1839-1842, the fort and much of the land about it was in their possession. He explained to the Khan’s Vakil how very desirable it was that the fort should again come into British possession, and added that as a Company of Sappers and Miners were on their way to Quetta they might he marched into it. Subsequently he wrote to the VakU in this sense. However, the Government of India, while approving what Major Sandeman had done, were anxious that the occupation of the fort should not he proceeded with except with the concurrence of the Khan. The difficulties in obtaining this assent were removed by Lieutenant Hewsons murder which rendered immediate occupation necessary. The repair and alter ation of the foit to such an extent as to render it defensible has been sanc tioned, but special care has been taken to carry out the work in such a manner as to avoid exciting opposition or dissatisfaction. Thus the demolition of resi- cnces, the destruction of gardens, as well as other measures likely to cause public inconvenience or alarm have been prohibited. It has also been decided that the ammunition in the fort should be increased to 600 rounds per man, and that three heavy rifled guns and a howitzer should be mounted in the citadel during the cold weather.

The Commander-in-Chief is Fakir Mahomed, who has always displayed a friendly attitude towards the British Government. Many of the troops, however, are Pathans, and the Afghan Commandant, Mosun Khan, has been one of the leaders of the party opposed to the policy of the British Government. Speaking of the army generally Major Sandernan has described it as fanatical, hostile to the British Government, and frequently beyond the Khan’s control. During 1877 it may be said to have been in a chronic state of discontent—chiefly on account of the large arrears of pay due to it—which at length found vent in a somewhat serious outbreak. It appears that on the 4th October the Khan determined to hold &amp;fete in cele bration of the marriage of the daughter of Fakir Mahomed, the Commander- in-Chief, with Mir Mahomed Khan His Highness’ sou, and it was arranged that the soldiers should perform some Afghan dances in the open space outside the town of Khelat. Captain Wyllie’s report thus described what happened :— “ The night was a particularly cold one, and it appears that the men got excited with dancing, and considering that the amount of wood furnished them was insufficient, they made a rush on a large stack of wood belonging to the Khan which was piled close by. Commandant Mir Baz Khan, who was present, endeavoured to prevent their taking this wood, and I under stand hit one or two of them, on which they immediately turned on him and hit him, and would probably have killed him if he had not escaped and hid in a neighbouring house. The men were by this time in a highly excited state, and paraded about the outside of the town, abusing His Highness the Khan for not giving them their pay, and abusing the Khan’s advisers and some of their own officers. If at this period they had been able to get into the bazar of the town, they would probably have done much damage, but they were fortunately without the walls, and their excitement gradually subsided under the influence of a frosty night. Even as it was, I believe several people were hurt, one woman being badly wounded by a sword cut in the breast. “ I believe no guards were turned out or any effort made to quell the riot. The Khan was not present at the dance, nor were any of his principal officers. The next morning the whole ot the infantry (which was the portion of the army concerned in the riot) were confined to barracks. The Khan appears to have behaved in a very decided and firm way with them, and to have abused and lectured them soundly. For two or three days there was still a feeling of excitement amongst the troops, but it gradually wore out and no further demonstration took place, largely owing, I am informed, to the presence of my escort. The Khan since then has called a meeting of his principal officers. It was His Highness’wish to pay up the troops, but in this he was overruled by the unanimous voice of their officers, who represented that if he did such a thing, the greater portion of his army would desert en masse with their arms, equipment, and uniform to Afghanistan; their payment has therefore been deferred until the arrival of Mustaufi Fakir Mahomed from Kutchi. “ Tbe troops appear to have acquiesced in this, and everything now appears to be quiet again.” This outbreak drew the Khan’s serious attention to the necessity of reform ing his army. In the Khelat Diaries for November he was described as settling accounts with bis men, dismissing some, chiefly Pathans, and discharging others. Eventually, it appeared that he dismissed 600 of the worst characters, thus greatly diminishing if not entirely getting rid of the army difficulty. And most of the Pathan sepoys had taken or intended to take their discharge leaving the more manageable Brahuis and Biluchis.

Exploration of the Route to Candahar via Tull and Chotiali —In paragraph 28 of Foreign Department Resolution, dated 16th October 1875, the Government of India alluded to the importance of opening an alternative route for the passage of traffic between Candahar and India, and they authorized the Punjab Government to take such measures as might be( 156 ) practicable to revive the old trade road via Tull and Chotiali. If necessary, communications might be opened with the Amir Shere Ah, m order to enfit the co-operation of the Cabul authorities Acting upon these suggeshons tie Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab (Sir Henry Davies) at lessed the following letter to the Amir (15th November 1875) “ I have the honor to inform Your Highness that under instructions from the Government «I have the honor to miorxn iuui ~ of India, one of my trusted officers. Captain Sandeman .s proceeding to the Murri Hi The obiect of his mission is to endeavour to settle by fnendly mediation the dtfference, n existing between the Murri and Brahui tribes, as these differences besides being the cause of strife and bloodshed, are at present a grave source of injury to the trade winch passe, ft* Your Hi°'lmess’ dominions through the Eolan Pass to Entish India, should he be unable finally to settle the disputes, he may yet succeed in inducing the parties to abstain from warfare 4- 1 'l '4' /Y d O T1 &lt;1 i V Cf As Your Highness is, in common with the British Government^ interested in promoting the development of trade and the security of merchants, and as portions of the trade routes lie through Your Highness' territories, I beg to solicit your co-operation in this important matter. “ Should Your Highness see fit to lend me your support, I would ask the favor of your deputing an officer of suitable rank to meet Captain Sandeman at Dasht-be-daulat or elsewhere and confer with him upon the subject; as the presence of Your Highness' representative, by indicating the good understanding of the British and Cabul Governments in the matter, will give weight to the proceedings, and re-assure those who might otherwise, from ignorance, regard them with suspicion. “ Captain Sandeman has been instructed to send notice of his approach to the border of Biluehistan to Your Highness’ Governor at Candahar, in order that in the event of Your Highness deciding to send an officer, as above suggested, the latter may be able to arrange the date of the meeting in communication with Captain Sandeman.' The wording of this letter seemed to the Government of India to go beyond their instructions. The Amir might understand from it that he had been invited to co-operate, not only in the opening up of the old trade route from Candahar, hut also in the settlement of the Murri and Bugti disputes, and in the general arrangement for securing the safe passage of trade through the Bolan Pass. The event proved that these anticipations were well founded, for His Highness replied as follows, ignoring altogether the route question and taking up that relating to Murri quarrels :— “ Translation of a letter from His Highness the Amir of Cabul to the Hon’ble the Lieutenant-Governor of tie Punjab, dated 7th Zikad 1292=6th December 1875. “Your Honor's letter of the 11th Shawal (10th November), intimating Captain Sande- man’s proceeding to the Murri Hills to settle disputes between the Biluchi, Murri, and Brabui tribes, and asking me to depute an officer on behalf of the Cabul Government, has come to my perusal on the 21st Shawal (20th November). “ It does not appear from the communication what section of the Brahuis is at dispute with the Murri tribe, and what is the cause or motive which is to subject them to future dissension. “ As it is the same dispute about which Sirdar Mulla Mahomed Biluch and the other Biluchi Sirdars came over to the Cabul Durbar and presented a petition on the subject in 1287 Hijri, 1870 A.D., the said petition was given in original to the British Agent at C abul in a friendly way, and no facts were elucidated by the British officials. “ It is therefore requested that Your Honor will kindly furnish me with a full detail of the facts in question, so that a reply may be sent to you after due consideration of the same. The Punjab Government in reply explained the mistake which had been made. . It had not been intended, they said, to trouble His Highness with the dissensions of the Biluch and Brahui Chiefs, but merely to enlist his co-operation in the development of trade between Candahar and British tenitory. To this letter the Amir vouchsafed no answer, and the matter ended. In June 1877 Major Sandeman was asked to advise upon a proposal to depute Major Browne, R.E., to examine the Tull-Chotiali route from ls hm to d-Jera, Ghazi Khan. He considered that it would be impossible lor that officer to proceed without the protection of a strong escort o troops. Even this precaution probably would not prevent the Pathan tribes trom attacking him.Meantime Major Sandeman had himself been considering the explora tion of this route, upon which he had been directed to report in accordance with the instructions of the Resolution of October 1875. His idea was to start from Dera Ghazi Khan in the spring of 1878 and find his way across the hills to Quetta. The chief objection was the expense of feeding the tribes who would form his escort. The Government of India desired him to report fully his proposals and observed that Afghan territory, through which the greater part of the route lay, could not be explored without the Amir’s consent, which could not be asked for at present. About this time Major Browne, R.E., arrived at Quetta, whither he had been sent at the Agent to the Governor-General’s request to continue the survey of the proposed railway towards Quetta upon which he had been engaged in the cold season of 1876-77. And at the same time Sirdar Dost Mahomed, the head Kakar Chief, also arrived. As to this man it is sufficient to notice here that he had proposed to visit Quetta in the previous April, and that the Government of India, while sanctioning the visit, warned Major Sande man to be careful not to receive any overtures unfriendly to the Amir of Cabul to whom the Kakars owed, or were believed to owe, allegiance. This Chief had several interviews with Major Browne with the result tnat Major Saademan was led to propose that Major Browne, escorted by Brahui and Pathan Chiefs, should proceed from Quetta by the direct route to Burkhan in the Khetran country, avoiding the Amir’s territory altogether. He thought that the Amir was anxious to establish his authority over the country in question, but up to the present time had been unable to do so. It appeared to the Government of India that this view of the Amir’s right was incorrect, whether judged by existing maps or by the considerations which in 1875 had led them to invite the Amir’s co-operation. They held that nine-tenths of the road passed through territory, neither British nor Khelat, that part passed through Sibi which was certainly Afghan territory, that the Ameer claimed the allegiance of the tribes in the other part, and that the tribes acknowledged their allegiance in a variable way more or less definitely. And bearing in mind the present relations with the Ameer, neither friendly, nor openly hostile, they declined (telegram, dated 26th November) to allow the explora tion of the route, except upon full consideration of written proposals. Major Sandeman was also told to explain his statements about the territory through which the route passed and not to act without further instructions.

The Biluch Guides. —Mention has been made at pages 90 and 116 of the arrangements whereby the Biluch Guides were temporarily placed at the disposal of the officer in charge of political relations with Khelat and of the subsequent transfer of the entire force from the Military to the Political Department. It was, however, a condition of this transfer that provision should be made for placing a sufficient number of Guides for outpost duty at the disposal of the Officer Commanding the Sind Frontier Force. In accordance with this direction Major Sandeman reported (No. 52, dated Ith April 1877) that he had arranged with Colonel Nuttall for the employment of 10 Guides—or 80 in all— at each of the outposts of Ghoranari, Sunri Toj, Soi, Shahpur, Pulaji, Lehri, and Mittri. Measures, however, were contemplated which would enable this number to be reduced. Subsequently, in June last, Major Sandeman submitted a report by Captain Reynolds on the'present condition of the Guides with suggestions for their improvement. For the early history and constitution of the corps I must refer to this report. With regard to its future organization and duties Major Sandeman wrote:— “It is necessary to employ the Guides on two distinct kinds of service, viz., (1) service at the outposts and in escorting officers, stores, &amp;c., from the British frontier( 158 ) , -rr i • j. t? Ion Vaw f2'l the protection and escort of stores, &amp;c., through thp throu-li Katchi to the B B fco ’ Q y ttaj Khelat, and elsewhere and the keeping open of ^ Bolan Pass and above t P and other distant , parts ot the khanate, such as Kedj, Panj. communications wi. f or the reasons given by Captain Reynolds, the same S won’ttS blwanfabte tbe passes, and that therefore a change in the systej enlistment hitherto pursued must be intioduced. . “ With a view to obtaining this end, I have divided the corps into two wings-tl, Witn a View to , , t j aco babad at the outposts as Guides and on escortdnty right wing w.n be chiefly be enlisted from the Beluch tribes belonging J &amp;e ^farasDadar andthemenwillc arters ^ ^ Mt wing wffl be “rd^il^tras polls, be recruited b y men belonging to the Brahni trife o[ Khorasan and the Bolan Pass. , c , , The existing system of enlistment alluded to by Major Sandeman wastlras described by Captain Reynolds : — '■The Beluch Guides consist of three Rasaldars and twelve Jemadars, each of tht latter having under him from ten to twenty-five sowars, there being also about thirteen men called ‘ Kliana nishins,' who draw pay as Guides without performing any regular service f«, it Besides this, there are sixteen Bugti sowars whose pay is received by the Bugti Chief and who remain for duty under his orders. The Kesaldars receive fifty rupees a month, bnt have no recognised duty In connection with the rest of the corps beyond general supermtendene,. Each Jemadar enlists his own men, subject of course to the approval of the Officer m charge of the Corps There are no Non-Commissioned Officers, but each Jemadar nominates a man, o-enerally his brother or some relative, as Duffadar to act for him during his absence on leave- an indulgence of which the Beluch avail themselves to the utmost extent. Indeed, in the early days General Jacob allowed sowars either to serve themselves, or, if prevented from doing so by any cause, to send a brother or cousin on duty in their place. Hence the fact of many men beingknown by two or more names, and the difficulty of ascertaining who was originally enlisted. It will thus be seen that their present organization is of the rudest nature, and that there is nothing in the corps deserving the name of interior economy.' As a matter of fact, at the time when the report was written, over one-third of the 300 horsemen comprising the corps were substitutes who paid Rupees 2 per mensem to the real sowars who remained at home. These substitutes, moreover, for the most part belonged to non-warlike races and declined, to serve in the Bolaa Pass and Khorasan. The proposals submitted for the improvement of the corps may he briefly stated as follows:— (1.) The raising of the pay of the sowars from Rupees 15 to Rupees 20 per mensem. (2.) Their admission to pension. (3.) An increase in the strength of the corps. (4.) The supply to them of rifled carbines to be paid for by instalments and to become their own property. They were generally approved, and the following total strength of rank and file at a cost of Rupees 9,815 per mensem to he met from Imperial revenues as a Political charge, was sanctioned:— 2 Ressaldars at Rs. 150 each Jemadars 12 Duffadars 16 400 Sowars » }&gt; &gt;} }&gt; &gt;&gt; » )} » 3) )&gt; 75 50 30 25 20 Us. p. m. 300 225 450 360 400 8,000 Munshi on Armourer on Hammerman on Bellowsboy on Allowance for charcoal Rs 30 p. m. 30 „ 9 „ 6 Total, Rs. 9,735 Total 80 80 Grand total, Rs. 9,815 p. m,( !59 ) 0,1 36 ilk, eB ^t The plan of dividing the regiments into two parts, one for duty in Kutchee, and the other for employment in the neighbourhood of Quetta, was approved.

RELATIONS BETWEEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, CASHMERE, AND THE FRONTIER STATES OF CHITRAL, YASSIN, AND DIR. 92. Geographical and Descriptive Account of ChitraL- The country of Chitral or Kashkar is situated between latitude 35° 15' N. aid latitude 37°, and longitude 71° 30' E. and 74° lO 7 E. It is divided into two great divisions of Upper Chitral or Chitral Bala, and Eower Chitral or Chitral Payan. The chief town is Chitral. Lower Chitral, or, as it is sometimes called, Lower Kashkar, is bounded on the north-west by the Hindu Kush, which separates it from Badakshan, a dependency of Cabul; on the south-east it is bounded by the Laspur or Laspi- sar mountains, also called the Pranshi or Lahori range, which separate it from the State of Dir; on the west lies Kafiristan, the boundary line of which con sisting of high mountains is not clearly defined; and on the east lies Mastuj, from which it is separated by an artificial boundary, of which no definite account is given. The extent of Lower Chitral cannot be accurately stated ; but the distance from the Nuksan pass in the Hindu Kush range, to the Lahori pass in the Laspur range, is about 75 miles. Chitral is governed by the Khan Aman-ul-Mulk, whom the Mullah described in 1873 as being about 50 years old, and of fine physical appearance. He has * a two legitimate wives,—one a sister of Rahmat-ullah, Khan of Dir, and the other a * Trans-Himalayan Explorations, 1873-74-75, p. 31. sister o ° f 1 As ^ t Klian - % n the f 0rme ^ he has a son, Sardar, 10 or 11 years old, and another young child ; by the latter he has no family. He has also three illegitimate sons, Murid, Shabmulk and Gholam. Of these, Gholam is about 12 years old, and a very active and clever lad, but has already shown signs of a blood-thirsty disposition, as he is said on one occasion when in a rage to have shot one of his brothers attendants.^ t “ Aman-ul-Mulk has the reputation of being a very deceitful man, speaking to thehum- f Vide Report of the G. T. S. 1870-71. blest of his men in a soft hypocritical manner, behind which he conceals a bad unfeeling heart. He is said to live in the constant fear that his country will be taken from him; and to avoid X Sic in original. an Y good excuse for this being done, his evil acts are always so planned that the blame shouldf rest on the shoulders of others.” Aman-ul-Mulk is styled “Padsha” or King, when addressed by letter or otherwise, but when spoken of is termed Mihtar-i-Chitral. The valley of Upper Chitral is drained by the Kunar or Chitral river, which, north of the town of Chitral, consists of two streams, the chief of which, nown by the name of the Mastuj river, rises in two branches in the mountains crossed by the Baroghil and Tui or Moshabur passes. The lesser feeder rises in 11 1 ec ^ on Nuksan pass, and joins the main stream near the town of • / course J n °t far from Darush, the Shushidarah stream flows into the Chitral river. e political divisions of Upper Chitral are Mastuj and Yassin. These two divisions, although politically under the rule of Aman-uW - geograplncafiy quite separate. Mastuj is situated in the Upper Cl -y anc 18 t se P ara ted from Yassin by the range of the Moshabur mounl rivpr rnnnf 1 ^ 1 !! 68 a va ^ e J s J which drain into the Gilgit valley river lunning through which joins the Indus. measurement 1 ^ etween Upper and Lower Chitral is not defined. 1 the towns of Pi the town of Buni, situated half-way bet of Hunza and Y ^ an hyM a stuj, to the mountain boundary between the £ breadth it kln^ff VeS an extreme le ^h of about 95 miles. 0 f ossi e to give an accurate statement, but it appears by ameasurement to be about 70 miles, the limits being the Baroghil pass, and the mountains which separate Yassin from the small States of Daril and Tangir. The present ruler of Upper Chitral is Pahlwan Bahadur, also called Pahlwan Khan, who is styled the King, Mir, Mihtar or Khan of Upper Chitral. He is a vassal of Aman-ul-Mulk, ruler of Lower Chitral. “*Upper Cliitral has until very recently been quite independent of Kashgar or Lower * Trigonometrical Survey Report, 1873-'74-75, p. 33. Chitral, and the two countiies have always been ruled by two different branches of the same family, descended from a common ancestor named Kathor, the Khushwaktia branch ruling in Upper f Aman-ul-Mulk. an( l the Shah Kathor in Lower Chitral. Of late years the influence of Aman-i-Mulk,+ the present representative of the Shah Kathor branch, has decidedly preponderated, and he exercises con siderable authority over both Mastuj and Yassin as well as in his own hereditary dominions. When Mir Wali (who was the representative of the Khushwaktia branch) murdered Mr. Hayward, he was expelled from his government by order of the Aman-i-Mulk, and his (Mir Walffs) cousin Paidwan Khan was put to reign in his stead. Mir Wali was subsequently re-installed, but was again exiled. He took refuge with Mir Fateh Ali Shah, the 1 w*te ruler of Wakhan, and was absent in Badakshan when I visited Wakhan in 1874, since which time he appears to have made a fresh attempt to recover his dominions, as it has recently been reported that he has been killed in a light with his cousin Pahlwan Khan, the present ruler of Upper Chitral.” The ruler and inhabitants of Upper Chitral are, the Mullah says, of the Shia sect, while the ruler and inhabitants of Lower Chitral are all Sunis, in spite of which the reigning families intermarry. The town of Yassin, the chief place in Yassin, is situated, if Mr. Drew’s map may be trusted, 7,762 feet above the level of the sea. Mr. Hayward has described Yassin as being a large village, containing a strong fort; it is the residence of the ruler of the country when he is in the Yassin district of his dominions. Pandit Munphool says that Yassin is resorted to by traders in slaves. The Mullah, who visited it in 1876, says that it only contains 200 houses, and that its name is pronounced Y r ass5n by the inhabi tants. [From a precis by Lieutenant Temple.'] 93. Letter from Aman-ul-Mulk, Ruler of Cliitral, to the Maharaja Of Cashmere. —A letter addressed by Aman-ul-Mulk of Chitral to the Maharaja of Cashmere about the middle of 1876 opened a door for the renewal of friendly negotiations between those tw r o States. Later in the same year Aman-ul-Mulk finding his overtures were favourably received sent another letter. In this he made a direct tender of submission to the Maha raja. He wrote:— (C It is as clear as day that during the lifetime of my late father and the father of lour Highness, the practice of interchanging envoys and letters, and of union and allegiance was customary, and that year by year hawks and horses were despatched from this side as f nuz- zerana/ After the decease of my father and the late Maharaja, this practice remained in abeyance for some years on account of the evil conduct of the sons of Gohur Aman. Your Highness with magnanimity overlooked this matter. But at this juncture Meer Wullee, son of Gohur Aman, who with want of foresight had killed an Englishman without my permission, thus throwing disgrace both on myself and on Your Highness, caused the door of communica tion to be entirely closed. According to the pleasure of Your Highness I imprisoned him, and was on the point of delivering him up when Providence decreed his death. I did this simply with a view to Your Highness* pleasure. And now, recalling the practice of my father, I elect the friendship of. and submission to, Your Highness, for the friend of Your Highness is my friend, and the evil disposed to Your Highness is my enemy. Whatever instructions or orders Your Highness may g’ive me, there shall be no defect in the execution of them. If it is desired, a (or the) son o! ! mine will present himself before Your Highness in the spring. And, when opportunity offers, I will myself proceed to the Gilgit frontier at some time, and will there meet the officers of Your Highness, and terms of allegiance will be approved. And a confidential agent of mine will always remain at Gilgit as a Vakeel, for to increase the friend ship of the father is befitting for worthy sons.”( 162 ) The same letter showed the fear which Aman-ul-M ulk entertained in respect to the Amir of Cabul. The latter, he said, had not only seized hadak- slum, but had also stationed troops at Zebak, only two days'journey from Chitral. He had thought it prudent to maintain friendly relations with the Amir. But if the latter should attack his dominions, he would, resist, and probably Bahmut-ullah Khan of Dir, his brother-in-law, would assist. He then proceeded to guarantee his own fidelity and that ol Palwan Bahadur of Aassin; ami alluding to the friendship subsisting between the British and Cashmere Go?, ernments, begged that he also might be deemed a well-wisher of the English. [Secret, July 1877, No. 42.] 94. Meeting between the Viceroy and the Maharaja of Cashmere at Madhopoor in November 1876. The Maharaja consents to the location of a British officer at Gilgit.— In November 1876 His Excellency the Viceroy arrived at Madhopoor in the Kangra District of the Punjab, and was there met by the Maharaja of Cashmere. An interview took place on the 17th November at which Mr. Thornton, Colonel O. Burne, Majors Bradford and Henderson were present. Dewans Joala Salmi, Anunt Bam, and Govind Sahai were in attendance on the Maharaja. The following is a summary of the conversation which took place “ His Excellency commenced the conversation by a brief review of the present position of affairs in Europe as regards the Eastern question, noticing the attitude of England and Russia in regard to it. He proceeded to show bow the interests of the British Govermnent and its Indian feudatories were involved in it, and how the rapid march of events had made it necessary to take into consideration the adoption of measures for ensuring the peace and security of the Indian borders. Among those measures His Excellency observed that the strengthening of our frontiers claimed primary importance; and it was with reference to the portion of the frontier which is adjacent to the Maharaja's territories that he wished on the present occasion, in continuation of conversations which he had already had with Dewan Govind Sahai at Simla, to consult His Highness. As His Highness was well aware, the country beyond his frontier was inhabited by a rude and barbarous people who own allegiance to various Chiefs in no respect more advanced than the populations over whom they exercise suzerainty. il It was essential, the Viceroy said, that such States as Chitral and Yassin should come under the control of a friend and ally of the British Government like His Highness, rather than be absorbed, in the course of events, by powers inimical to Cashmere; this became the more necessary from there being certain Passes through the mountain range bounding these territories on the north, which Passes, it is believed, are more or less practicable, or can be made practicable, for the passage of troops. il B was in order to examine one of these, the Ishkaman Pass, that Captain Biddulph had been deputed during the present year by the late Viceroy; and here His Lordship took occasion mcKlentally to acknowledge, in suitable terms, the cordial assistance afforded to that officer by iri j, 1U , ra *i a aiK ^ h ! s °fficials. His Excellency continued that, though the result of Captain Biddulph s observations had not been entirely confirmatory of the reports that Government had previously received regarding the practicability of this Pass, still there could be little con t that other Passes exist close to, and in connection with it, the command of which, for the sake ot the safety and peace of Cashmere, should be in the Maharaja's hands, or in those of e fV 1! * 1 overnment. In order to attain this end, it was necessary. His Excellency thought, to obtain full control over the countries lying between them and the Cashmere frontier, , A 8 01 s ip invited the opinion of the Maharaja as to the best means of carrying out a o jee . is Excellency observed that in the above remarks he had frankly expressed bis views an opinions to the Maharaja, and he begged His Highness to reciprocate that confi dence and speak with the same frankness. The Maharaja cordially thanked His Excellency for this signal mark of confidence, ai i i bl°f ee e( 0 recount briefly the circumstances under which interchange of communieatic nf COmmenced vv . ith Ehitral and Yassin in the time of the late Golab Sing up to di Yassin P nn^^fM 0 ^r UniCatl0nfr0mthe Mir of Chitral, of which the Vakeels of Chitral a effeet Ant tlA A ^k 00 . 1 ^ were the bearers. The substance of this communication was to t Hayward at tl I' A ^. re !i® w ^iendly relations, which had ceased since the death of ft deSent he tnf l f ^ aud to “ an Envoy from the Maharaja whe was offered in fh e &gt; and whose protection he sought. The allegiance of Yassin a was offeied m the same letter. His Highness added that there are three methods of securithe objects pointed out by the Viceroy, viz., either (1) to take advantage of the internal dissen sions which so frequently occur in those countries, and use the opportunity so offered, according as circumstances may arise, for annexing the States; or (2) to endeavour by negotiation to obtain political control in those States; or (3) to reduce the country by force of arms. Either of these three courses His Highness was prepared to adopt if the British Government desired it. “ The Viceroy expressed a wish to be favored with the Maharaja’s opinion as to the parti cular course which appeared to him most suited to accomplish the desired object, but wished in the first place to explain his own views on the matter, which were, that peaceful negotiation was the best and most effectual means of bringing Chitral and Yassin under the control of Cashmere. His Excellency expressed his readiness to aid such negotiation by any means in his power, and added that in the event of the Maharaja’s action ever involving him in military operations (which was not very probable), the British Government would be prepared to give him countenance and material assistance. His Excellency hoped that it might be possible to set on foot the negotiations above suggested at once, and he thought that the Chitral and Yassin Vakeels should be present at the Imperial Assemblage to be held at Delhi, in order that having already entered into friendly negotiation with the Maharaja, they might be also made acquainted with the strength and resources of the Government on which Cash- mere relies. The Maharaja expressed himself as quite concurring in these views, and stated his readiness to open at once negotiations with the Mirs of Chitral and Yassin. The Vakeels would in the meantime be detained in order to attend the Imperial Assemblage. His High ness, however, begged the Viceroy to favor him with a written authority to commence nego tiations, in order that it might not be in the power of evil-disposed persons hereafter to accuse him of entering into relations with foreign States for his own ends. “The Viceroy expressed his willingness to furnish the Maharaja with the requisite authority in such form as might be most satisfactory to him. United by identity of interests, as well as by ties of friendship, it was the sincere desire of Government to see the Maharaja’s State prosperous and his frontier well protected. “ As a practical proof of the sincerity of this sentiment, His Excellency offered for the Maharaja’s acceptance as a gift from the British Government 5,000 stand of rifles for his army, either Snider or Enfield. The Maharaja, in acknowledging with gratitude this mark of favor and confidence on His Lordship’s part, left it for His Excellency to determine which description of arms would be most suitable. “The Viceroy proceeded to say that, having communicated to the Maharaja his views on the peaceful absorption of Chitral and Yassin, which he believed to be a subject near to the Maharaja’s heart, there was one additional measure which Government think it necessary to carry out for the further security of the Cashmere frontier, and the transmission of regular and reliable information regarding the condition of that frontier, viz., to station a British officer at Gilgit who would be specially charged with these duties. “ His Highness the Maharaja professed his readiness to consent to the appointment of an officer in Gilgit, should circumstances ever occur to render such a, measure necessary, but in the meantime he preferred to construct a telegraphic line to Gilgit, so that Government may obtain immediate and constant information regarding the frontier. “ His Excellency observed in reply that Government considered the necessity for the stationing of a British officer in Gilgit to have already arisen in consequence of the Russian annexation of Khokand, and the present attitude of the Ameer of Cabul towards Chitral. His Lordship proceeded to explain that the duties of this officer would be confined to external frontier relations, and that he.would exercise no interference in the internal administration of Cashmere. His Excellency added that he wished to refrain from exercising any direct control over the States adjacent to the frontier, but would prefer in all cases that the influence of the Maharaja’s Government should be directly brought to bear on them. It was with this special view that the Chitral and Yassin Vakeels had not been given a direct invitation to Delhi, and that His Highness had been requested to invite their attendance. “ The Maharaja observed that the idea of a British officer at Gilgit being entirely cew to him and unexpected, he would beg His Lordship to allow him time to weigh fully the argu ments for and against the measure. “ His Excellency acceded to this request.” On the following day the Maharaja renewed the conversation. He said that having carefully thought over the proposal to station a British officer at Gilgit, he 'was prepared to consent to it, hut desired to make in writing certain representations on the subject. To these the Viceroy promised his best consi deration, and as a proof of the desire of the British Government to strengthen the Maharaja’s position, His Excellency informed the Maharaja that a mountain 'battery, consisting of four rifled 7-pounder guns with complete( 164 ) equipment, was being prepared in the jPerozepoor Arsenal for presentation to His Highness. Subsequently, 4,000 Enfields and 1,000 Sniders with 200 rounds of ammunition per rifle were also presented. [ Secret, July 1877, No. 38.] 95. Conditions upon which the Maharaja accepted the proposal to depute a British officer to Gilgit. The Viceroy’s reply. —Accordingly, in a letter to the Viceroy, dated 26th November 1876, the Maharaja proceeded to explain his views regarding the location of a British officer at Gilgit. He said that he expected one great advantage, and feared several disadvantages from the arrangement. The advantage was that the information which the officer would probably obtain would enable efficient provision to be made for the security of the frontier. The disadvantages were— (1.)—That the measures winch the officer’s report might necessitate for the protection of* the frontier might injure the Maharaja’s Government and position. (2.)—That notwithstanding His Excellency’s assurance to the contrary, the officer deputed might in one way or another interfere with the internal administration of Cashmere. Dr. Cayley’s proceedings at Ladakh were cited in support of this. That officer superseded the Maharaja’s orders regarding the trade in shawl wool, but no attention was paid by the Government of India to His Highness’ remonstrance. The letter proceeded :— “ Though I apprehend many more disadvantages, I think I should not mention them here, as my object is any how to please Your Excellency's Government. I am heartily thankful to Your Excellency for having kindly given me words fully assuring me that the officer to be appointed shall not in any way interfere in my internal administration, and that the Supreme Government shall never appoint in any way any Resident or Political Agent; and I declare openly to Your Excellency that the inevitable necessity in the matter, the strong sense of my duty to give every satisfaction to Your Excellency, the outspoken manner in which Your Excellency condescended to explain to me the real intentions of Her Majesty's Government of India, and Your Excellency's kind words graciously assuring the continuance of the dignity and integrity of my Government and position, have induced me to waive my objections to the measure proposed at present. But I beg to inform Your Excellency that the people of the frontier are very turbulent, and no reliance whatever can be placed in their words; and it is a fact that on several occasions they fought with my troops in defiance of the solemn engage ments into which they had entered by swearing on the Koran. . ^ hope, therefore, that Your Excellency will favor me by giving me a written Sunnud containing the words of assurances alluded to above and the points mentioned below, so that it may be of use to me in the future:— I. No interference should ever be made in any affair affecting trade or my administra tion, or any matter regarding my subjects, officials, and servants. “ II.—The proclamation by territories.

You will have learnt from Your Highness’ confidential agent, Dewan Joala Sahai, who presented the above communication to me at Lahore, that I regard the requests contained therein as in every way reasonable and worthy of consideration ; I have much pleasure therefore in conveying herewith the assurances desired by Your Highness. The officer stationed at Gilgit will be strictly bound by the most explicit instructions to abstain from all interference in the internal administration or trade of Your Highness’ territory, in the affairs of your subjects, or in the conduct of your official servants. His functions will be con fined to collecting information regarding the frontier, and the progress of events beyond it, accompanied by such advice to Your Highness and to the British Government as his military experience may enable him to offer in regard thereto, and assisting, should occasion require it, the organization of any military measures on the border which may have previously received the free assent and full approval of Your Highness. In the performance of all those duties he will be instructed to communicate with Y our Highness no less freely and confidentially than with the British Government. “ Should he fail to carry out strictly the conditions of his appointment, as set forth in this letter, of which he will be furnished with a copy, he will be at once recalled. “ With reference to the desire very naturally expressed by Your Highness to be consulted in the selection of the officer, I have to state that I will most gladly avail ^ myself of Your Highness’ advice and suggestions in a matter which so deeply concerns both Governments. “I do myself the honor of forwarding herewith, for Your Highness’ information, notes of our conversations at Madhopoor, and also a record of what passed at my interview with Your Highness’ confidential agent at Lahore on the 29th ultimo. “In conclusion, I beg frankly to reassure Your Highness that the appointment of a British officer at Gilgit has been proposed by me solely with a view to extend the influence, and streno-then the power of Your Highness’ Government on the frontier, and in no wise to weaken the authority, or lower the dignity, of your rule, which it is the wish, as well as the interest, of the British Government to support and uphold; nor is the present measure intended to form a precedent for enlarging or altering the arrangements that now exist in respect to the position of the f officer on special duty’ at Srinuggur.” [Secret, July 1877, Nos. 39-40.]( 166 ) 96. Appointment of Captain Biddulph as officer on special duty at Gilgit.— Subsequently with the concurrence of the Maharaja, Captain John Biddulph of Her Majesty’s 19th Hussars was selected for the post of special officer at Gilgit. Arrangements having been made for his transfer to the Staff Corps, he proceeded to join his appointment at the end of September. The following instructions were given to him, and the Maharaja was asked to notify the appointment throughout His Highness’ territories “ I have the honor, by direction of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, to inform you that, with the concurrence of His Highness the Maharaja of Jummu and Cashmere you have been selected for appointment as officer on special duty in Gilgit. “ 2 . The object of your appointment is fully explained in the accompanying extracts from the Proceedings of the Government of India and correspondence with His Highness the Ma- haraja of Cashmere, but it may be here briefly stated that the duty with which yon are primarily charged is to endeavour, with the co-operation of His Highness and His Highness’ officials, to collect and furnish reliable intelligence of the progress of events beyond the Cashmere frontier, together with such information as may be obtainable regarding the topography and resources of the localities in your vicinity. “ 3 . You will also endeavour, in consultation with the Cashmere authorities, to cultivate friendly relations with the tribes beyond the border in view to bringing them gradually under the control and influence of Cashmere. In the event, however, of any hostile movement of tribes in the vicinity rendering it necessary for Cashmere troops to cross the frontier, you are authorized to accompany them and assist the Officer Commanding with your advice and experience, hut you will on no account interfere with the internal administration of the Maha raja’s territories or encourage complaints against his Government. “ 4 . You may, at your discretion, interdict and prevent British subjects, English or Native, from proceeding beyond the Cashmere frontier whenever you deem such a course desir able in the interests of their personal safety or on grounds of political expediency. “ 5. You will be furnished with an escort of 1 Havildar, 1 Naik, 12 Sepoys, and provided, at the expense of Government, with a Yarkund tent and six pals, a medicine chest, and such mathematical instruments for survey and observation as the Surveyor-General may consider suitable. “ 6 . You are further allowed a credit of Rupees 2,000 per annum for ordinary presents and secret service, and authorized to entertain two orderly chupprassies on Rupees 6 (each) per mensem. His Excellency in Council will also he prepared to consider favorably, with the concurrence of the Maharaja, proposals for the construction of a residence and the establish ment of a dispensary. “ 7. Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, your salary has been fixed at Rupees 1,500 per mensem, to which is added a local allowance of Rupees 500 per mensem to be expended, at your discretion, in the entertainment of Native visitors, and on other matters of a political character without rendering an account. “ The above salary and allowance will commence from the date on which you leave Simla en rou te for Gilgit. You will further be entitled to travelling allowance at Rupees 5 per diem when marching. 8 . You will furnish a weekly diary of intelligence and proceedings in the annexed form th tough Major Henderson, the Officer on special duty in Cashmere who will be the channel or your communications with the Government of India. The above arrangement does not, owever, prohibit your addressing the Foreign Secretary directly on occasions of urgency, but in such case, a copy of any communication you may address directly to the Government should be foi’warded to Major Henderson. Should a favorable opportunity present itself for your proceeding on a friendly to Yassin, Hunza Nagar, Daril, Tangir, Chilas, Gor, Talicha, Harband or other similar localities, you are permitted to avail yourself of it without further reference, provided the Cashmere autho rities concur and your personal safety is not unduly risked.'

Interview at Delhi between the Foreign Secretary and the Vakeels of Chitral and Yassin.—On the 4th January the Chitral and Yassin delegates who in accordance with the Viceroy’s suggestion had accompanied the Maharaja of Cashmere to Delhi had an interview with the Foreign Secretary. Their names were Wazir Jafar Ali and Bahrain Shah, and Sultan Hyat, foster-brother of Palwan Bahadur of Yassin. The two first named expressed the desire of the Mir of Chitral to become dependents (tabidar) of the Maharaja of Cashmere. They were told that the Viceroy approved the negotiations which had been commenced, and that a dependent of the Maharaja was a dependent of a close friend of the British Government. That a British officer would be stationed at Gilgit, not for the purpose of interfering in any way with the internal administration of the country, but to obtain reliable information regarding the progress of events on the northern frontier. A hope was expressed that the Mir of Chitral would co-operate with the Maharaja in affording assistance to the officer. The Vakeels replied that Chitral. was now included within the Maharaja’s territories, and whatever the latter wished would be done. [Secret, July 1877, No. 41.] 98. Further correspondence between the Mir of Chitral and the Maharaja. Proposals for a Treaty between the two Governments. —During 1877 Aman-ul-Mulk wrote frequently to the Maha raja. His first letter written in the spring threw doubts on the good faith of Rahmut-ulla Khan of Dir, his brother-in-law. The latter had ceased commu- t nicating with Cashmere, and had made professions of friendship and submission to Cabul. He had sent his son thither to pay his respects to the Amir. However, it was quite possible that Kahmut-ulla might turn round and correspond again with the Maharaja, for he was an untrustworthy man. A strong hint was thrown out for a letter from the British Government. And it was evident that Aman- ul-Mulk was much exercised with fear of the Amir of Cabul, and with doubts of the fidelity both of Kahmat-ulla Khan and Palwan Bahadur. The Maharaja of Cashmere replied congratulating Aman-ul-Mulk on his desire to renew ancient friendship and accepting his submission. A promise was made that should necessity arise there would be no shortcomings on the part of the Maharaja. In the interests of both parties it was desirable to conclude a treaty, with which object the Mir was asked to depute one of his sons or an envoy with full powers. Subsequently Aman-ul-Mulk agreed to depute his son, Nizam-ul-Mulk and Palwan Bahadur to Muhammad Summa on the Gilgit border to meet Bhai Ganga Sing. The proposed treaty could then be arranged, and afterwards Nizam-ul- * The Maharaja of Cashmere to Dewan Mffik WOUld proceed to Cashmere to Wait OU the Gohiud Sahai, dated 9th May 1877.

Aman-ul-Mulk’s apprehensions of danger from Cabul. love arflV Opinion of the Maharaja of Cashmere on the situation.— Early onocca^ ffi March Aman-ul-Mulk represented that all the neighbouring Chiefs were js direct),v ! submitting to Cabul, and that he would be isolated. Did the Maharaja wish him to conciliate or resist the Amir \ if the latter, he must have money and roce ^ arms. The matter was urgent, because an envoy from Cabul was on his way t0 Chitral. !) pfovi^ !5t ’' Major Henderson wrote that at an interview with the Maharaja he had dis- * Major Henderson, dated asth covered that His Highness* considered it not unlike- March 1877 . ly that the Chiefs of Dir and Chitral had arranged between themselves, that the former should comply with the summons from( 168 ) ttis Amir of Ccibul wliilo the latter should make oveitures to Cashmere, hig Highness had no doubt that Aman-ul-Mulk was really anxious as to the Amir’g designs on Chitral, and that an early response to his overtures was advisable. The Maharaja suggested sending a small sum of money as an earnest of the friendship he was willing to accord, further and more substantial assistance being postponed until a formal agreement had been concluded with the Mir, Further, the money to be given at once should not appear to be sent in eon^ pliance with the Mir’s present request tor assistance, but on some other ground, such for instance as the assistance given to Captain Biddulph last year. Thus! while the gift would not compromise the Maharaja in any way, it would have the double effect of attracting rhe hopes of Aman-ul-Mulk to this direction, and of detaching him from Cabul, where his acceptance of aid from “ Kafirs” would be an unpardonable offence. With regard to the probabilities of a successful invasion of Chitral by the Amir of Cabul, the Maharaja considered that Aman-ul-Mulk was quite capable of defending himself from any attack made from the direction of Badakshan where the force available for invasion could not be large, and the passes leading from which were easily defended ; these passes moreover were only open for three months in the year. Successful invasion would also have been an impossibility from the west, if it wei e not for the apparent defection of Dir and Bajour under the influence of the Akhund of Swat. As to the material assistance that it w r ould be in his power to give to Chitral, the Maharaja considered that to send troops into such a country, and so far from their base of operations, would be out of the question, and that assistance could only be given in the shape of money and arms, the extent to be determined by the further development of events. Major Henderson was directed to inform the Maharaja that Aman-ul-Mulk having accepted the suzerainty of Cashmere could not be allowed to secede to Cabul. Possibly the Maharaja would like to take the initiative in securing Aman-ul-Mulk’s allegiance and resisting the claims of the Amir which the Bri tish Government would not acknowledge. If so, His Highness might confi dently rely upon the support and assistance of the British Government. The Maharaja, however, thought that the action he had himself suggested was sufficient for the present. The Chitral and Yassin Vakeels had been dismissed with Bupees 5,000 for Pal wan Bahadur, the present for Aman-ul-Mulk being kept temporarily in abeyance. The Maharaja’s action and proposals were entirely approved. [Secret, July 1877, Nos. 47-48 and 51-53.] 100. Warning sent to the Amir of Cabul in regard to Bajour, &amp;e. Maharaja of Cashmere is informed of the present relations of the British Government with Cabul. —In consequence the Maharaja s remark about the defection of Bajour and Dir the Government ot Inuia thought proper to direct the Commissioner of Peshawur to write o the Amir in his own name in the following sense and in a firm but friendly tone :—- ° tumours which you are reluctant to credit have reached Peshawur that he is endeavouring to assume sovereignty over Bajour, Swat, Dir and Chitral.

So far as could he ascertained, the attempt to raise a jehad had completely failed, but it had been deemed, under existing circumstances, inexpedient to allow our representative to return to Cabul, and His Highness had been informed that the British Government held itself free to deal with circumstances as they arose without reference to his interests; that so long as he abstained from aggression upon British territory or territory under British protection, he would not he molested, but that the British Government in no way sanctioned or recognized any attempt on his part to obtain suzerainty over countries beyond the recognized limits of his north-eastern border. [Secret, July 1877, Nos. 49 fy 54.] 101. Visit by certain officers of the Maharaja of Cashmere to the Ruler Of Chitral —On the 18th May Sirdar Mahomed Akbar Khan submitted a report of a visit which he had paid to Chitral in company with Mukassar Shah, Dindar Khan, and Bah ram Shah. On his way from Gilgit he had passed through Yassin, where Palwan Bahadur treated him courteously. At Chitral Aman-ul-Mulk expressed his readiness to swear on the Koran that he would obey the orders of the Maharaja. He v as ready to send his son Nizam-ul-Mulk to Summah to meet Bhai Gunga Sing and to receive a resident official of the Cashmere Government at Chitral provided a discreet man were chosen. He also wrote to Rahmat-ulla Khan of Dir advising him to send his son to Summah. But the latter replied that he had already sent his son to Cabul to tender his submission to the Amir, and it was too late for him to draw back. Besides, although in former days he had derived much advantage from an alliance with Cashmere, of late the Maharaja had taken no notice of him. While the Sirdar was at Chitral messengers arrived from Dir and gave an account of the reception of the Khan’s son at Cabul. An Agent of the Shahghazi Sherdil Khan also arrived on the part of the Amir of Cabul to arrange for the betrothal of Aman-ul-Mulk’s daughter to the heir-apparent Abdullah Jan. The proposal was accepted, and the Agent contemplated an early return to Cabul. A few day’s later Aman-ul-Mulk thus expressed himself to the Sirdar in the presence of Mukassar Shah and Dindar Khan: “That he had come under the protection of the Maharajahs Government; he also had close relations with the Amir of Cabnl, as he had agreed to give his daughter (in the Amir's family), but that there was no harm in that; that if the Amir desired, he would also furnish him with female and male slaves, but in heart he held the skirt of the Maharajahs Government, and would not leave it while alive ; that he has enmity with the surrounding nations, and has no protector except the Maharaja ; that if the Afghans would prepare to fight him, he would avoid the conflict; that if the Amir summoned his son to Cabul, he would send him; that if he is himself summoned, he would not go, but excuse himself by forwarding female and male slaves as presents; that if compelled to fight, he would fight, and, if overpowered, would come to Yassin and there lodge, as succour can at that place be expected from the Maharajahs Govern ment; that if he was not even safe there, he would proceed to Gilgit or Cashmere, as he has no other place of protection; that he is fully aware of the oppression and tyranny which the Afghans exercise, and had therefore desired his relatives, Afzal and Malk Shah, to go and pre sent themselves before the Maharaja and obtain a livelihood from His Highness; and that his relatives accordingly went to the Maharaja and have been well treated, and are saved the trou ble that they would have experienced by going before any other Chief/-’ Shortly afterwards the Sirdar left for Targa under the belief that the visit of Nizam-ul-Mulk to Suxnmah to meet Bhai Gunga Sing had been settled. But Palwan Bahadur raised every possible difficulty. He received the Sirdar on his arrival at Y^assin very coldly, upbraided him for having made no men tion of the proposed interview on his previous visit, and declared that he had lost all confidence in him. He tried to make Aman-ul-Mulk believe that Bhai Gunga Sing never intended to come to Summah, so that Nizam-td-Mulk on arriving there would be disgraced. He stationed a number of armed men at( 170 ) various places along the route, and led the Sirdar to believe that he meajt mischief. Eventually, though he agreed to the meeting, it was thought advis. able to postpone it under pretext that the rivers would soon rise and rendei travelling difficult. Aman-ul-Mulk, however, was not disposed to give m to Palwan Bata, dur. On the 30th May Bhai Gunga Sing reported that Aman-ul-Mulk tad written announcing that his son Nizam-ul-Mulk had already started for the place of meeting which might take place at Ivoshan 01 elsewhere it access to Summah was too difficult. [Secret, November 1877, Nos. 60-63.] 102. Meeting at Tamashki between Bhai Gunga Sing and Nizam-ul-Mulk and Palwan Bahadur.— Accordingly Gunga Sing set out forthwith from Gilgit and arrived at Tamashki near Roshan on the 9th July. Nizam-ul-Mulk and Palwan Bahadur were awaiting him there and immediately presented themselves to pay respects. Bhai Gunga Sing kept them a couple of days taking special pains to secure their confidence. He told Palwan that the Cashmere Government had no designs upon his territories. If that Government had desired to pursue a policy of annexation, why should it have given up Darel, Chalas, and Manar after having conquered them ? It was quite sufficient that Palwan had acknowdedged the Maharaja’s suzerainty, and there would be no necessity for any Cashmere troops to remain in the country. With regard to nuzzerana, he accepted Palwan’s proposal that hawks and horses, the natural produce of the country, and not money, should be sent. Khilluts were then conferred on Nizam-ul-Mulk, Palwan Bahadur and their chief attendants. Palwan was also told that the khilluts were bestowed in return for the services rendered to Captain Biddulph. The total value of the presents was about Rupees 6,000, of which upwards of Rupees 3,000 went to Nizam-ul-Mulk. [K. W. No. 1, Secret, November 1877, Nos. 60-79.] 103. Further correspondence and negotiations with Chitral .—To the Maharaja of Cashmere Aman-ul-Mulk wrote (the letter was received in July) saying that he had sent his son Nizam-ul-Mulk to Summah. He reiterated his professions of allegiance and agreed to an exchange of repre sentatives, only stipulating that the Maharaja’s officer at Chitral should be a man of high rank. He said that the Amir of Cabul had taken possession of all the country, and had extended his influence to Zebak and Wakhan. What policy should he (Aman-ul-Mulk) adopt ? Was he to temporize with Cabul or not. And he begged for assistance in money and the like as troops would not be able to reach him in time. On receipt of this letter the Maharaja consulted Major Henderson, who reported as follows the results of an interview with Dewan Anunt Bam on the 6th July :— With regard to the first point, viz., the policy to be pursued towards Cabul by Aman-ul- u v, 1 told the Dewan that I could express no opinion on the subject, being in ignorance of ic progress ot events in that quarter and of the views of Government. ^y.i^h icgard to the second point, I observed that any gift of arms seemed to me out of the question, and that any money gift should, perhaps, for the present at any rate, be restricted to tlie smallest amount which would suffice to ensure Aman-ul-Mulk looking in this direction ins &lt; a o owaids Cabul ; any allowance made being increased afterwards if necessary, and if Aman-ul-Mulk abides by his engagements. The Dewan told me that Mian Mokassar Shah A 1 . f )eei J u l s luc ^ e d to Innt that Rupees 5,000 yearly might he the allowance fixed, hut the Mehter had considered this an inadequate sum. The Maharaja is, however, prepared to raise this to Rupees 10,000 per annum • Tji aS ve , * pk °\ v an w hether it was not intended to conclude some formal agreement with of 3 in dld n °^ See r m t0 be at a11 clear about this ; or as to what should be the provisions ot such an engagement.

In the Maharaja’s opinion a judicious distribution of a little money just now would win hack all the Chiefs who had offered allegiance to Cabul, if this was any object. Aman-ul-Mulk had professed his readiness to break off the match between his daughter and the Amir’s son, if the Maharaja would give him a hint that he wished it. But for doing so he would require an extra consideration. Aman-ul-Mulk was still very apprehensive of an attack from the Badak- shan side, and did not feel himself secure on his western flank, now that all the Chiefs in that direction had submitted to Cabul. Major Henderson thought that Aman-ul-Mulk was in earnest in the overtures he was making to the Maharaja. The difficulty was to obtain any kind of security that lie would remain faithful to his engagements when the present need had passed away. On the 7th July Major Henderson had an interview with the Maharaja, of which he submitted the following account:— CD “ As arranged, I called on the Maharaja yesterday, and he related to me the substance of his first conversation with Inayet Khan, the Chitral Vakil. Judging both from his acts and professions, His Highness believes that Aman-ul-Mulk is really sincere in his offer of allegiance to Cashmere. He is in considerable fear of an attack from Eadakshan, and is at present the more apprehensive on account of his isolated condition; Dir and Bajour, &amp;c., having given in their submission to Cabul. “ As the price of his allegiance he asks for money and arms from the Maharaja; assistance in troops be does not want, having, he says, 50,000 men that he could bring into the field if he had the means to arm and equip them. Aman-ul-Mulk is also anxious to know what is to be his policy with regard to Cabul. This is substantially identical with the request for arms and money, for it really means that if he is counselled to resist, he must be the better pro vided with means of resistance. “ The Maharaja is quite prepared to make him a handsome allowance, and the amount will be a matter of negotiation. Arms, His Highness thinks, should not be given. As the only possible means of securing some return for the subsidy given, the Maharaja will require Aman-ul-Mulk to enter into a formal engagement acknowledging the suzerainty of Cashmere and consenting to mutual exchange of Vakils. In the engagement His Highness is willing to bind himself to give a certain subsidy. He does not think it advisable just now to-require Aman-ul-Mulk to give free access to travellers or to enter into any engagements about trade or duties, as this may give rise to some suspicion in his mind. Immediately on receipt of the reply of Government to his references, the Maharaja proposes to draw up an engagement and send it for Aman-ul-Mulk’s signature by the present Vakil. He hopes the ratified copy may be brought back by the Mehter’s son whom he will invite to visit Cashmere next spring. “ From the Vakil’s statements it appears that the people of Dir, and especially the brothers of Rahmat-ulla Khan, are much discontented with him for having submitted to the Amir. Indeed Itahmat-ulla himself repents the step, and is said to be willing to transfer his allegiance to Cashmere. The people of Bajour and neighbouring petty Afghan States do not like the idea of the Amir’s direct rule, and the Maharaja considers that a coalition of all these States to resist any aggression from Cabul could easily be formed now if necessary. “ Pal wan Bahadur of Yassin is strongly opposed to any rapprochement between Chitral and Cashmere; but seeing that Aman-ul-Mulk is determined, he has been obliged to withdraw his opposition for the present. The Maharaja thinks that he will discover it to be to his advantage to forward the arrangement, but if not, some means may be found to render him harmless.( 172 ) “ Hk Highness suo-wsted tliat I should see the Chitval Vakil myself; but as I understaad it to be the wist of Hillxcellency the Viceroy that thejlaharaja^one should appear i„ . . « s-'t■% * i 1 ,1 T.lAT* ^Ti3iL ' — 'V ^ J- UllUd I would'rather not see them unless ordered to do so. ...

Instructions issued by tbe Government of India —The Maharaja then sent Aman-ul-Mulk’s letter to the Viceroy, and asked that the wishes of Government might he made known to him. These were communicated to him in the following letter from the Viceroy, dated 2nd August. “Your Highness’ friendly letter of the 8 th July, with its enclosure, on tbe subject of the negotiations with the Chitral Chief has been duly received and considered by me, and I have discussed the important matters referred to therein with your confidential agent Diwan Gobind Sahai. 1 have also carefully considered the views expressed by Your Highness to Major Henderson on the occasion of his interview on the 7th instant. “ I beg to express my satisfaction at the progress of the negotiations thus far, and my best thanks for the trouble Your Highness and Your Highness’ officials have taken in the matter and for the valuable suggestions offered by you. “ With regard to the course to be pursued in reference to the letter of Aman-ul-Mulk, I fully concur with Your Highness that it will be well to secure the allegiance of the Chitral Ruler by the promise of a yearly payment of such amount as A our Highness may consider suitable, and that, for the present at any rate, no arms should be supplied to him. “ With regard to the conditions of allegiance, I share Your Highness’ opinion that they should be as brief and as little onerous as possible consistently with the main object to be secured; with this view it will suffice, in my opinion, if the document embodying these condi tions contain— First, an express recognition by the Chitral Chief of Your Highness’ suzerainty; Secondly, an arrangement for the exchange of representatives; and, Thirdly, an agreement by Your Highness to grant the Chitral Chief such annual subsidy as may he determined so long as he faithfully carries out the terms of his allegiance. “No stipulations regarding the grant of free access to travellers, nor engagements regard ing trade or duties need be included therein, but, at the same time, there should be nothing in tbe document prohibitory of future arrangements on this subject. “ The engagement, when drawn up, might, as suggested, he sent for the signature of Aman-ul-Mulk by the hands of the Vakil now present at Srinagar, and the son of the Chitra Ruler might appropriately be invited to bring the ratified copy in the ensuing spring. “ From the letter of the Chitral Chief and the verbal representations ot his messenger, it appears that Aman-ul-Mulk desires a reply to two important questions, viz., — what course be should pursue, under present circumstances, in view of the threatening attitude of the Ruler o Afghanistan, and, in particular, what action he should take in the matter of the proposed betrothal of his daughter to Abdulla Jan, the heir-apparent of the Amir. “Speaking generally, it appears tome advisable that the Chitral Chief should on no account disavow his allegiance to Your Highness, but at the same time should avoid precipi a • ing a conflict with Sher Ali Khan or the Chiefs who have joined his standard; and I ai' ie this course for two reasons—first, because at present the defence of Chitral from aggression is a matter of some difficulty, and, secondly, because it is not improbable that time may come Ins assistance and remove or greatly lessen the difficulties which now beset him. “ For the same reasons, it appears desirable that Aman-ul-Mulk should in the matter of the betrothal of his daughter, maintain, if possible, a temporising policy, but, on tins, f on the other point, Your Highness’ opinion is of greater value than my own ; and I confidently leave the reply to both enquiries to Your Highness’ own judgment and discretion.JSffil R'as ies jjl tlie des ‘VfUldkt; ^ rorthecoi^, ‘ ls turl)aiicesoj|,l ia y ^ neeesiiK-. r P 60 !^.

I can give him no hope of being recognized as a protected feudatory of the British Government ; but should Your Highness be willing to accept his vassalage, and deem such course desirable for the objects we have in view, 1 will gladly recommend that Chief to make a tender of allegiance to the Cashmere State. “ In conclusion, I have to suggest to Your Highness that although, for the present, it appears unnecessary and undesirable to send troops into Chitral, yet inasmuch as events may happen which may render such proceeding necessary, it may be well for Your Highness to cause a careful examination to be made of the passes leading to Chitral, and full information to be collected as to the character of the roads, the supplies available, and other matters likely to be of use in the event of military operations in those parts becoming unavoidable.^ [Secret, November 1877, Nos. 71-73.] Acting upon these suggestions the Maharaja addressed Aman-ul-Mulk in the following sense with the full approval of the Government of India:— He accepted the Mir’s compliance with the proposal to send his son to Srinagar and to exchange agents as a proof of sincerity. He alluded to the desirability of reducing the terms of alliance to writing and forwarded the draft treaty given below for Aman-ul-Mulk’s execution. With regard to rela tions with the Amir of Cabul, the Maharaja advised the Mir to continue to pursue a temporizing policy and to act hereafter as circumstances might require and the Maharaja direct. He then comforted him with the assurance that suitable arrangements should be made for the defence and protection of Chitral in accordance with the requirements of their friendship and alliance. Nothing should be withheld which would conduce to the Mir’s welfare and protection. o the lettooll* ire the allegisi: ,s Your Higtase be supplied to I* ur Highness* (fE tly with the * icument enhodyil- 0 r Highness* si®' Ives; and, litral erms avellers, time, there» # ct ' . ,..i ed, b« agar, ai 1 in the represent^ .fcquestionSif •eatening^J in the f ie S ! ;- mil f 5 P 3 , Chitrr 1 anre tP c lined h'S l aD®y 0 ' f 1 ' (■nient an® (Translation) true copy of an Engagement (made by tbe Aman-ul-Mulk, Ruler of Chitral, with His Highness the Maharaja of Cashmere, no date.) “ With the sincerity of purpose and the cordiality of will, I (the Aman-ul-Mulk) do hereby execute this deed on my own part and on the part of my children, consisting of the following articles :—• ^ • “ Article I. “I engage that I will always sincerely endeavour to obey and execute the orders of His Highness the Maharaja, the Wali of Jammu and Cashmere; that I will overtly and covertly consider His Highness* well-wishers and friends as my friends, and the enemies of his Govern ment as my enemies; that I will present the following ‘ nazrana to His Highness annually as an acknowledgment of his paramount power :— “ 3 horses. “5 hawks. “ 5 Tazi dogs (hounds). * “ Article II.

Overtures for se- curing the friendship of the British Government.-The doubt, entertained by the Mir of Chitral as to the fidelity of Rahmat-nlla Khau of hi, rested on ffood foundation. That Chief sent Ins son, Mahomed Shard, in company with other Khans of Bajour to Cabul. They arrived there in the beginning of the year having been met at Batkak by an intantij and aitilleiy escort, they were honorably received by the Amir in public Durban, and nere told that they had been summoned to Cabul to make the Amir s acquaintance and to join him in a holy war against the infidels. Attci lifteon days stay they were all dismissed with suitable presents, and firmans were, granted guaranteeing to each Chief his territorial independence, and conferring certain allowances in return for a recognition of the Amir s supiemacy. hahmat-ulla Khan was made a Nawab, and bis son, Mahomed Sharif, was accepted by the Amir as heir to the Chiefship of Dir. But notwithstanding the courteous recep tion accorded to his son at Cabul, Rahmat-ulla Khan was dissatisfied. It may have been that bis cupidity was excited by the accounts of Aman-ubMulk’s dealings with Cashmere, or like all orientals, he was desirous of playing off one power against another and making all he could out of both of them. At any rate, Rabat Ama'n, Kaka Khel, a trader with extensive dealings in Bajour, Dir, and Chitral, reported that Rahmat-ulla was ready to throw over the Amir of Cabul. In return for a public disavowal of bis connection with the Amir and an acknowledgment of the British Government the Khan would expect a grant of money sufficient to buy 1,000 horses, an annual allowance of Rupees 20,000 in perpetuity, protection from the encroachments of other powers, e.g., Cabul, a guarantee for the immunity of his territory from internal interference; the grant of appropriate allowances to be paid through him to the smaller Chiefs in his neighbourhood on condition that they also should disown the Amir. It was also desirable that the title of Nawab should be obtained for him from the Sultan of Turkey, to be used as a means of allaying the religious pre judices of his tribe; and that bis son and four headmen should receive annual allowances. On receipt of written instructions Rabat Aman was ready to bring into Peshawur accredited Agents of the Khan and other Chiefs. The Chief of Dir also took steps to open communications with the Cash- mere Government. As Mukassar Shah and Dindar Khan passed through Dir on their way.to Chitral, Rahmat-ulla expressed regret that he had severed his connection with Cashmere and begged to be allowed to reopen communica tions. The Chitral Ruler was also desirous that Cashmere and Dir should here- united. Rut the Maharaja would not respond until he had consulted the Viceroy. He observed that he had no control over the people of Yaghistan, who vanted money 7 to keep them in order. The Government of India have placed no pressure on the Maharaja to induce him to listen to these overtures. Their policy has been to temporize and it was intimated to Dewan Gobind Sahai that the Government of. India did not wish the Maharaja to accept the vassalage ° | ie unless His Highness himself desired it. At an interview on the 2nd October with Majors Henderson and Biddulph the Maharaja said sat, by an expenditure of money, he was confident of being able to detach Dir from the Amir of Cabul, as well as Swat, Bajour, and other Mirsbips. On being asked what assistance he could give to Dir in case of its being attacked &gt;y ttie Amir, he answered that the only assistance he could render would be by ^ivmg money and. inducing Amal-ul-Moolk and other Chiefs to assist bv force y u± coercion n , lle s 0 attack him, and by setting on foot intrigues in Dir itself.

The Chitral despatch— The following despatch, dated 11th June 1877, to which no reply has yet been received, explains the policy of the Government of India in regard to the relations of Cashmere with Chitral ******* * For these appendices see the orl ginal papers. “ W 0 have now to submit, for Your Lordsbip^s approval, an account of the action we Lave taken for securing* an object of kindred importance in the general scheme for the pro tection of the North-West Frontier, that is to say, an efficient control over the passes of the Hindu Kush between the eastern confines of Afghanistan and the north-western frontier of Cashmere. “ The principal passes of that portion of the mountain harrier separating Central Asia from the tributary valleys of the Indus are three in number—the Karambar or Ishlcaman, the Darhot and the Baroghil. Of these the Karambar leads from Sark ad, in the valley of the Oxus, to the head of the Ishkaman valley, whence a road, practicable for laden animals, leads in three marches to Gilgit in Cashmere territory j and thence, either by the usual route to Srinagar, or via Chilas, to Torbela on the Indus. This pass is at present open in winter only, the summer route having been recently closed by the protrusion of a glacier from a side valley. The Darkot pass leads from the same starting point, in one day's journey, to a village of that name at the head of the Yassin valley, and from Yassin south-east to Gilgit, or, south-west by the Tawi, Tagawi, or Skandar passes, to Masluj and the valley of Chitral. It is open for horses and for traffic for ten months in the year, but is permanently impassable for artillery. The Baroghil pass leads from Sarhad to the head of the Chitral Valley; it is practicable for artillery^for ten months in the year ; and, from the head of the valley, a road suitable for laden animals, and, it is believed, also for artillery, leads down the fertile valley of the Kunar river to Chitral, and from Chitral either to Jalalabad in Afghanistan, or through the territory of Dir, to the British District of Peshawur. A detailed description of the several routes indicated above will he found among the Appendices* of this despatch. “ Attention was first prominently called to the strategical importance of these passes by Lieutenant-Colonel T. E. Gordon and Captain Biddulph, members of the late Mission to Yarkand, who were temporarily detached from that Mission for the purpose of proceeding to Wakhan and exploring the Pamir Steppes and the passes in their vicinity. Extracts from the reports of these officers are appended. YVur Lordship will perceive from them that the first- + A „ n _ nf1 . vrr named officer in his memorandum,! dated 2 nd November 1875, points out that the possession of Kokand places the Russians at almost exactly the same distance from the Baroghil Pass as the nearest British military station, viz., Abbottabad in the Hazara District. f It may he safely said/ he adds, f that a force, starting from the Kokand Frontier, could reach Baroghil well before our troops marching from that post. The former would proceed from the grassy plains and valleys of the Alai, the Kizilart, and the Pamir, crossing easy passes at no great height, and traversing a country the nature of which, as we know from personal experience at even the most unfavour able time of the year, admits of x’apid travelling; while the latter would journey by a road which, in its present state, offers many physical obstacles to continued forced marches/ Again, he says, f a glance at the map will show that Ishkaman in Y'assin, with the valley of the Oxus before it, is a point of the greatest strategical importance, cheeking advance from the direction of the Pamirs, holding the Baroghil Pass, commanding Chitral and the tribes between that and the northern side of the Peshawur Valley, threatening Jalalabad (240 miles), Cabul (315 miles), Balk (390 miles), and the Oxus line of communications, and even menacing the Merv line/ “ Captain Biddulph, who personally examined the route from Sarhad to within a mile of the Baroghil, remarks as follows: “ ‘ Assuming that a force might be assembled at Ush for offensive purposes, the informa tion w.e gained of the Pamir roads from the Kirghiz shows that there is nothing to prevent the rapid advance of *m army fully equipped to within a few miles of Sarhad. Arrived within thirty miles of Sarhad, road-making for guns becomes necessary; but a strong advanced guard, supported by mountain-train batteries, would effectively secure the work from interruption. From Sarhad to the top of either of the passes, not above one mile and-a-half of road needs preparing for the passage of field guns, and the invader finds the choice of several routes open to him. By the Baroghil Pass he can follow the course of the Mastuj stream to Chitral, whence he can threaten both Jalalabad and Peshawur, or crossing by the Ishkaman Pass, he can reach Gilgit in three marches, and from there threaten the Punjab either by Cashmere or the Torbela route/ “ The information respecting the Karambar Pass contained in the reports from which the above extracts have been taken seemed to the Government of India to be of considerable importance; hut as the statements made were not the result of personal observation, it was deemed desirable to take measures to verify their accuracy. Accordingly, early in the spring of 1876, Captain Biddulph and Captain Grant, of the Quarter-master-Gencral's Department, were granted leave of absence with instructions to explore the route from Gilgit to the summit( 176 ) of the Karambav Pass. After a trying march from Srinagar, during which his comp,; broke down from exposure and fatigue Cant • » * See Appendix XIII for his report. Biddulph succeeded in reaching the south S U of the Karambar; but here further progress was stopped owing to a glacier from a side valley having, for the time being, effectually closed the route during the summer months. This condition of the Karambar, which has an impoi taut bearing on the results of Captain Biddulph’s explorations, thus effectually bars, for the present, one of the most import, ant passages into India from the north; yet, having regard to the possible removal of this natural obstruction in coming years, and to the undoubted practicability of the BaroghiU appeared to us imperative to take an early opportunity of encouraging our loyal feudatory, the Maharaja of Cashmere, to obtain an effective, but peaceful, control over the countries W between those passes and the Cashmere frontiei, namely, Chitial, Mastuj, Yassin, and their dependencies. “ A favorable opportunity for commencing negotiations on this subject presented itself in the arrival at Srinagar, in the middle of 1876, of one Jafar Ali, the hearer of com. munications from the Chitral Chief to His Highness the Maharaja of Cashmere. Later in the year, in response to a friendly answer from His Highness, another messenger arrived with an important letter, of which a translation will be found among the annexures to this despatch. In this letter the Chief of Chitral formally tendered his allegiance ot the Ruler of Cashmere, adding that his relative, the Chief of Dir, was with him, and that Raja Palwan, the Ruler of Yassin and Mastuj, was his dependent, and would likewise accept the suzerainty of the Maharaja. “ The offer of the Chitral Chief having been reported to the Viceroy, the subject was reserved by His Excellency for discussion with the Maharaja on the occasion of Ms interview with His Highness at Madhopoor on the 17th and 18th November 1876. What passed on that occasion will be found in the annexed extracts from the record of our proceedings. It will suffice here to state that, while the Maharaja undertook to endeavour by peaceful negotiation to obtain political control over Chitral and Yassin, His Excellency promised to aid the negotiations by all the means in his power, and assured His Highness that, in the event of his action involving him unexpectedly in military operations, the British Government would, if necessary, afford him countenance and material aid. It was further agreed that an English officer should be appointed to reside permanently in Gilgit for the purpose of obtaining information as to the progress of events beyond the Cashmere frontier; also that a line of telegraph should be constructed by the Maharaja,con necting Gilgit, Srinagar, and Jummu with the British telegraph system; and, lastly, that the Agents from Chitral and Yassin, then in the camp of the Maharaja, should accompany that Chief to Delhi, in order to be present at the Imperial Assemblage. They did so, and at an interview at Delhi with the Foreign Secretary, in the presence of the Maharaja's Minister, emphatically confirmed the representations previously made as to the anxiety of the Chitral Chief to become the vassal of Cashmere. “ After the close of the Imperial Assemblage, Bairam Shah, one of the Agents, proceeded on his return journey to Chitral by the Peshawmr route, accompanied . two representatives from the Maharaja, for the purpose of continuing the friendly negotiations w T hich had been commenced under such good auspices. Meanwhile, another letter from Aman- ul-Mulk reached His Highness by the Gilgit route, reporting the unexpected defection of th( Chief of Dir to Cabul, hut reiterating his tender of allegiance to Cashmere, and promising if the early spring to send his son Nizam-ul-Mulk with Raja Palwan to Gilgit to consummatt arrangements. Thus matters remained until the 28th of March, when a telegram was received from Major Henderson, the officer on special duty w r ith the Maharaja, reporting receipt by His Highness of another letter from Aman-ul-Mulk, to the effect that all th( neighbouring Chiefs were submitting to the Amir of Cabul, that he was left isolated and too weak to resist without assistance the pressure he expected from a Cabul Agent then on his way to Chitral. • l re l^Y the .above, His Excellency in Council authorized the Maharaja t instruct the Chitral Chief to resist the claims of Cabul, and to furnish him with the mean ot doing so, relying,_ it necessary, on the support of the British Government. At the saw nne, under instructions from His Excellency in Council, a letter was addressed by the Com missionei o esniwur to the Amir of Cabul, warning him against any endeavour to assum sovereign y ovei Swat, Dir or Chitral; and reminding His Highness, ir firmbu om tons anguage, that, as the British Government had never recognized’his claim to allegiaw an unfriendly ^ ^ en£ ° rCe Xt witUout the assent of that Government would be regarded a it i n ll'S 0n ^ « tb ® 3U ^ e ? tions of His Excellency in Council, the Maharaja km 1. ‘’T ™ 1 •l micUlre &gt; t0 do more than send to the Chitral Chief an* while to t 1 -e o,eh SUm f . and word 8 of friendship and encouragement, and m®' ino. countries The for “f erto ™“S ‘he exact position of affairs at Bajorn- and the mg countries. Ihese proposals were approved by the Government of India.“ No reply has yet been received by the Commissioner of Peshawur to the communication addressed to His Highness the Amir of Cabul ; but it may here be observed that within the last month, there has been a marked change for the better in the attitude oi: that Prince towards the British Government. His self-chosen isolation leaves the mind of His Highness a prey to the uncorrected gossip of the bazars, and the flying rumours of the hour. Actuated by alternate fears of the British, the Russians, and the Persians, his time during the last few months has been passed in marching and countermarching troops to meet an imaginary enemy ; and in intrigues hastily commenced under the influence of one panic and no less hastily relinquished under the influence of another, such as those to which we have referred with the Chiefs of Bajour and Swat. But we now learn, on good authority, that a considerable change is noticeable in the Amir’s language respecting his British, as compared with his Russian neighbours. Having completely failed in his attempts to shake the allegiance of the Khan and Sirdars of Khelat, His Highness now appears anxious to convey to them the impression that his relations with the British Government have recently improved. The large force which some time ago he was about to throw into Candahar has been counter-! rnanded. A report which we are unable to verify, that a considerable body of Persian troops is being concentrated in Seistan, appears to have seriously alarmed the Amir for the safety of Herat. Special messengers recently arrived at Peshawur from our secret Agents at Cabul declare that His Highness has at last released his long-imprisoned son, Yakub Khan, who is about to start for that place at the head of a strong force. Up to the present moment this information has not been continued by subsequent intelligence; but it will be obvious to Your Lordship how materially our own position at Quetta must now increase the Amir’s reluctance to forfeit the friendship or provoke the ill will of the British Government, should the fears of His Highness prove to be well founded. From various unconnected sources we also learn that some of the chief Sirdars at Cabul, and other influential persons, have earnestly remon strated with the Amir against his present alienation from the English, which they openly attribute to Russian intrigues, and are putting pressure on His Highness to recover our friend ship and secure our alliance. Meanwhile, the Cabul Envoy reported to be on his way to Chitral has not arrived there, and it does not seem likely that he will now be sent. On the other hand, the son of Aman-ul-Mulk, accompanied by Raja Palwan Bahadur, are, as pro mised by the Chitral Chief, on their way to Cashmere territory for the purpose of concluding with His Highness the terms of protection and allegiance. “ What may be the practical result of the above negotiations between the Maharaja of Cashmere and the Chitral Chief, it is of course impossible to predict with confidence; but there can be but little doubt that the people of Dardistan, who differ wholly in race, language, and traditions from the Pathans of the west, regard with deep concern the advancing pressure from Afghanistan, and are in sore need of a friendly protector. Thus there is a fair prospect of the Cashmere Ruler, supported as he is by the power and prestige of the British Govern ment, being able to acquire such influence and control in the above-mentioned States as will enable us, in course of time, to make such political and military arrangements as will effec tually command the passes of the Hindu Kush. Meanwhile, we have, with the concurrence of the Maharaja, selected for special duty in Gilgit, Captain J. Biddulph, whose Memorandum on the Chitral Passes and report of his journey to Hunza and the Karambar Pass will be found amongst the Appendices of this despatch. Captain Biddulph is an officer in every way fitted for the delicate duties with which he will be entrusted; and in consideration of the importance of his position, we have fixed his salary at Rupees 1,500 per mensem with a sumptuary allow ance of Rupees 500 per mensem. We venture to hope that our proceedings may receive the approval of Her Majesty’s Government which will learn, we feel sure, with much satisfaction, that the Maharaja of Cashmere has displayed the greatest loyalty and earnestness in support of our policy in this important matter, and is at this moment hastening the construction of a line connecting Gilgit, Srinagar, and Jummu, with our telegraphic system.” [Secret, July 1877, No 60.] 107. Tender of allegiance by the Chief of Shignan.— In the spring of 1877 the Maharaja of Cashmere received intimation that Mir Saif Ali, Ruler of Shignan, was prepared to tender his allegiance. It appeared, however, from the best information available that the greater portion of this Chiefs territory was situated on the right bank of the Oxus. Consequently, in accordance with the understanding arrived at with Russia in 1872, it lay beyond the sphere of British influence. Moreover, for the territory on the left bank of the Oxus the Mir was tributary to the Amir of Cabal. The Maharaja was therefore advised that it was not expedient that he should accept or encourage any tender of allegiance from the Chief of Shignan. [Secret, July 1877, Nos. 73-81.] .,,( 178 ) 108. Threatened disturbances on the Gilgit frontier.—in April 1877 Major Henderson was informed by the loca authorities at Srinagar that a report had been received from the Maharaja s head officer at Skardo to the effect that the Governor of Gilgit had applied to be lemforced with all available troops in anticipation of a threatened outbreak on the frontier. Letters received at Srinagar direct from the Governor of Gilgit confirmed the intelligence He anticipated a combined attack by all the frontier tribes on Gilgit and a simultaneous assault on Buuje with the object of cutting off all &amp; ’ • i.- „ riooUmovA A further renort showed that the ennfp communication with Cashmere. A further report showed that the confederacy was believed to include Harel, Tangir, Gor Harran, and Tor. Palwan Bahadur of Yassin and Hunza were also supposed to be implicated. A letter from Bhai Gunga Sing, Governor of Gilgit, dated 18th April, gave the following “One Sultan, a Goojar, was formerly in a position of trust with Malik Aman, whose right-hand man hewas. He afterwards joined Palwan Bahadur and took up his residence with his family in Yassin. Lately Palwan Bahadur sent Sultan to Tangir to call together a jirgah and explain that Aman-ul-Mulk, Ruler of Chitral, being in intimate relations with the Afghans and subject to the Amir of Cabul, there is no fear of hostility on the part of the Governor of Badakshan. And therefore he (Palwan Bahadur) had designs on Gilgit when the spring crops should be ripe. The Tangir people professed their readiness to join at once, but the Darel people replied that they would wait to see Palwan Bahadur’s power, and if he succeeded in conquering Payal, they would advance by the lower road on Gilgit through the district of Saee,* but before that they would not move. The Chila§ f*l 0 dus° Site Bun ^ ° n nght bank people also came to Darel, and representing that (literally) ‘ roads are coming to us/ asked what remedy they should take. The Darel, Tangir, and Tor people reassured them by promising to go and assist them in Chilas.” Major Henderson also learned from private sources that a collision between the frontier people and the Maharaja’s troops had actually occurred, in which a few of the latter were killed. Nevertheless, there had not been cause, in his opinion, for serious alarm. The following is an account of some of the places named :— “ Darel has seven fort villages, and, according to Girdlestone, 4,000 fighting men. Bid- dulph estimates the number of fighting men at 2 , 000 , and adds that they are very badly off for arms. The inhabitants are Sunnis, owe a loose fealty to Yassin, and are said by Biddulphto have friendly relations with Afghanistan. Darel was occupied in 1866 by the Maharaja’s troops. “ Tangir lies immediately west of Darel. Has a large fort said to he impregnable. Like Darel it ewes a loose fealty to Yassin. “ Runza is not a republic, but a petty principality under Raja Ghazan Khan. “ ( It may be described,’ says Biddulph, ‘as a long crescent formed by the hills receding from the river (Hunza) with the points towards the south.’ “ It is divided into eight districts, and each district has its own fort; arms are very scarce. .Nevertheless the people of Hunza in 1847 and 1866 successfully resisted the Cashmere troops. “ Harvan or Harband—is south of the Indus and immediately west of Chilas. “ Tor a village or group of villages on the north side of the Indus immediately adjoin ing Darel. \\iq Chilasis inhabit valleys south of the Indus and immediately west of Astor. They pay a nominal tribute to Cashmere since 1852, when they were punished by the Maharajas troops for the raids they had committed.” {Secret, August 1877, Nos. 80-95.] 109. Residence of European visitors in Cashmere during the winter months. —In 1872 a petition was presented to Lord North* biook s Government by the Church Missionary Society remonstrating against the orders which prevented Europeans from residing in Cashmere during the winter months. . I he Punjab Government were adverse to any alteration in existing orders being permitted. The Maharaja of Cashmere was known to object to any concession of the kind, and in the Lieutenant-Governor’s opinion the required permission should not be given without first consulting the Manaraja, and no pressure should be put upon His Highness to induce him to consent.( 179 ) le ad office The Government of India, however, took a different view. Considering the to be w relation in which the Maharaja stood to the British Government, to whose outheji 'aid he owed his dominions, it was preposterous that English gentlemen, nor of QjL:' whether missionaries or others, should he excluded from his territories as long as all th f! behaved properly. Nor was it right that such persons should be told that they the obi J remained in Cashmere at their own risk, and must not rely upon the protection owed i ^ of the British Government. Such an attitude could not be adopted towards a % Cashmere where the Baja was quite capable of keeping order and protecting life and property. The Punjab Government were therefore told to inform the I lm I% Maharaja that the restrictions hitherto imposed would not any longer be main- ^T'igaie! tained with regard to European travellers and others not Government servants, provided they conducted themselves with propriety and in accordance with the mst will] ||i. laws of the country while they were in the Maharaja’s territories. Subsequently, tool'upH at the request of the Punjab Government, the restriction was removed as regards ?' r tocallt^|. Government servants also. In March 1876 the Maharaja brought the matter ^terelationsp: before Lord Northbrook on the eve of the latter’s departure from India. _ He 011 the pan ( { observed that only the summer months had been appointed for the visit of ^ouGilgihi European tourists to Cashmere, and he hoped for a favourable reply confirming ]X 01ffl ! ! l l this view. But Lord Northbook replied that the orders withdrawing the res- mGiEtroi frictions placed upon Europeans entering Cashmere during the winter had been would not» passed by his directions three years ago. He added : id representing:! “ It appeared to me that the only ground on which this restriction on the movements of . what remedy fc. English travellers could be properly retained was that their lives would not he safe in Yom sin? to mailt Highness 5 dominions. But under Your Highness 5 administration there can be no apprehension on this account, and such being the case, there can be no reason why an Englishman should not ,, , „„ &lt;ro to Cashmere in the winter as freely as Your Highness 5 subjects can enter any portion of Her ;6S thatacofci Majesty’s dominions. ,uallj OCCliri,: I am sure that on consideration Your Highness will perceive, that in the interests of had not beets friendship and for Your Highness 5 own good name, it was very desirable that the old restric tion, which is unsuited to the present time and has uooasiu.ieu anfavo.abk cm—cuts ’-n ' _ _ ,,, . -it * it i 4-L /“v v.» 4 -t &lt;-&lt; L 1-1 /-wror’n m on T.( 180 ) and as there can be no apprehension on that account undei my administration, the restriction ia unnecessary j but I submit most humbly that if my administration had been so weak as f endanger the lives of English travellers, 1 would not have willingly allowed them to trawl within my territories during the eight summer months of the year. I lie character of mv administration therefore neither had nor has anything whatever to do with the restriction jn question, and cannot be adduced as an argument in support of the order passed by Lord North brook. ■ “ It is urged that there can be no reason why an Englishman should not go to Cashmere in the winter as freely as one of my subjects can enter any portion of Her Majesty^ dominions but the comparison does not hold good, inasmuch as it is as clear as daylight that neither mv subjects nor even my highest officials can under any circumstance impress a single British subject into service, whereas my officials have to force coolies to labour for every English traveller from the moment of his entering my territory till he quits it, and it is incumbent on my officials to abstract poor cultivators from their distant homes and fields for many days in order to make them carry loads of visitors moving about from one place to another within the districts. It is true that the coolies are paid four annas each for the day when they actually carry loads, but the advantage they gain from this pittance is far outweighed by the heavy loss they sustain by their constrained absence from ordinary occupations for a number of days unprofitably spent in going from and returning to their distant homes. This heartless oppres sion is felt and dreaded so much that the helpless cultivator often betakes as his last recourse to the demoralizing trick of buying off the unrelenting coolie-fetcber or of persuading a hardier neighbour to go for him by paying from his own pocket four or five times the authorized and expected hire for a day. Moreover, the travellers often go for sporting to hills and forests far away from human habitation and where no provisions can be obtained, and the poor coolies have therefore to carry from long distances everything that may be required for a long time. Though I have very much improved the roads from Kahala to Srinagar, my subjects have still to take as much trouble as ever for the carriage of the travellers, and as every provision for the visitors is brought from long distances, the difficulties experienced by the coolies are felt equally by the muleteers; and it is a fact that the districts along the Kahala road and the district Lai in Cashmere have, owing to the oppression described above, been deserted by the helpless cultivators, though I have remitted in the former districts a large portion of my revenue as a compensation for the loss sustained by the people. ^hough I do not complain against any English traveller, I think I should submit to loui Excellency s consideration that, when the amount of inconvenience caused to my people £ iT 6 ® u ™ mei ’ ^ ourists i . 8 80 m uch, no reasonable doubt can be entertained that the travelling p 7, 11 ®, 18 imer } ^ ie w inter would cause a much greater amount of oppression to the people of Cashmere, inasmuch as the severity of the weather would necessitate the carrying about from place to place many more loads than are generally required in the summer. . r ^ ie P eo P^ e Cashmere are engaged in the winter in gathering and stacking crops, weaving pattus and lois and making sundry arrangements for their domestic comforts, and ey wou c ctl am y ee t.ieinselyes cruelly oppressed if instead of being allowed four montlls , lespn e in re year, rey were obliged to carry loads in the inclement season at the risk of n ge r s am . oes icm frostbite (as was the case last year with the coolies of Mr. Shaw, wi-roVr Tvif n \ S d 0111 ‘ 1&lt; ‘} *°m Hasora to Srinagar, when two of them died and many more nil . j^ \ en J rr ' i 01 8 a k e °f humouring the sporting propensities of the visitors, the 11 r &amp; S ° Ute P 10 ^ 1 ^ 6 ^ sporting within my dominions is no valid reason that onnrp«!&lt;?inn fn° i Jrf 0 ? e 80 ruthlessly sacrificed.

Your Highness observes that this order was based on f a host of Sunnuds,* and you complain of its withdrawal without your previous consent. “ After careful examination of the archives of my Government, I have been unable to discover any Sunnud, Treaty, or other engagement between the Government of India and that of Your Highness containing reference to such a prohibition. The order to which Your Highness refers was issued, not by the Government of India, but by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and not in virtue of any engagement with the Government of Cashmere. “ It is, however, with regret that I learn by your abovementioned letter that an order of the Local Government, which had been for some time in force, was rescinded without prior communication with Your Highness, and I am persuaded that had the Government of India at that time been fully cognizant of the importance you attached to this prohibition, it would not have withdrawn it without previously explaining to Your Highness the reasons which, in the present social conditions of this empire, render it extremely difficult and practically almost impossible for the Government of India to enforce such a prohibition upon the private subjects of Her Majesty. &lt;( The wish to repair an unintentional omission would alone suffice to command my most careful attention to the representation which Your Highness has now addressed to me on the subject. But these representations are also upon other grounds entitled to the respect and sympathy of the Government of India. “ The known and appreciated loyalty of Your Highness to the Empress of India, the importance of the interest which Her Majesty has in common with yourself, and the close and cordial relations which so happily exist between the Government and that of Your Highness, are facts which render it impossible that the wishes of Your Highness for the welfare of your people should ever be a matter of indifference to the British Government. “The considerations mentioned in Your Highness* letter of the 30th ultimo, as constitut- ino* the practical ground of your objection to the residence of British subjects in Cashmere during the winter months are honorable to your humane solicitude on behalf of your people, and lam most anxious to assist Your Highness in removing and preventing the recurrence of the inconveniences to which you have called my attention. “Entertaining, however, as I do, a jealous regard for the high reputation which Your High ness so deservedly enjoys for hospitality to travellers of all nations, I cannot but fear that the revival of an order absolutely closing your country to British subjects during a large portion of the year may opeiate in a manner injurious to the general sympathy^ and esteem with which Your Highness is popularly regarded not only in this country but in England. “ It is not on this account alone, however, that I should deeply deploie the obligation to revive, and rigidly enforce, in the name of the Government of India, an order issued in past times by one of its subordinate administrations, excluding British subjects from the territories of Your Highness. There are circumstances not wholly unknown to Your Highness on the present external relations of the empire, which would I am persuaded be most prejudicially affected by such a step. “ In my recent interviews with Your Highness at Madhopoor I explained the causes which had rendered advisable the extension of a controlling and protective influence over the States lying beyond the borders of Cashmere. “Your Highness needs, I trust, no assurance that the Government of India neither desires nor contemplates any enlargement of the territories administered by itself. But the wild and weak populations of' Chitral and its present dependencies are, from their geographical situation and social condition, obviously unable to maintain complete independence of their more power ful neighbours. Having no wish to extend the direct jurisdiction of the British Government, but at^the same time being resolved not to allow these populations to be absorbed by any State which excludes British subjects and British influence from its own dominions, I have, with entire confidence on the enlightened and friendly character of the Cashmere Government, authorized Your Highness to bring these populations aild their territories under tne protection of your own power and have assured you that on maintaining that protection, you can in ease of necessity rely upon the assistance of the British Government. The spontaneous overtures which Your Highness has received from the Chiefs of Chitral and Yassin afford a favorable opportunity for^peaceahly and promptly effecting this result, which, if carried out in accordance( 182 ) with the principles agreed upon in our interviews at Madhopoor, will, I doubt not, be con- ducive, not only to the welfare of the border populations, hut also to the power and dignity of Cashmere. “But if the order referred to in Your Highness letter of the 30th ultimo be now sud denly revived and enforced, its revival will, I am persuaded, be prejudicial to excellent effects which may otherwise be confidently anticipated from the abovemeutioned arrangement. « In the first place it would tend to deprive the British Government in carrying out its part in the arrangement of that support which constitutes its greatest strength—the sympathy and confidence of its own subjects. In the next place I cannot but fear that by the ' nn^fs and neonle beyond and about our frontiers, it would be taken as indicative of a and confidence ot its own suojecxs. -in u.^ ™ tlie 1 ? I10rail t Chiefs and people beyond and about our frontiers, it would be taken as indicative of a want of cordiality and confidence on the relations between the British Government and the Govern- Vnnr HioWss. Such a result Your Highness would, I am sure, be the first tn deprecate. “ But whilst submitting these important considerations to the serious and friendly atten- tion of Your Highness, I am sincerely anxious to assist the Government of Cashmere in preventing the practical inconveniences to which Your Highness has called my attention, as resulting from the requirements of British travellers in Cashmere during the winter months. « Your Highness is doubtless aware that the military officers of the British Government are, except in very rare cases, unable to absent themselves from their posts of duty during the cold season, whilst its civil officers are seldom in a position to take leave of absence in India, I am therefore hopeful that the number of travellers in Cashmere during the winter months will continue to be so inconsiderable that the inconveniences mentioned in your letter (and for the prevention of which Your Highness can scarcely be more anxious than I am myself) may be effectually obviated by orders less absolutely prohibitive than the one to which reference is made by Your Highness. “ In this hope I am prepared to appoint immediately a British officer to draft, in concert with any person deputed for the same purpose by Your Highness, and subject to the concurrence of Your Highness-’Government, a new series of rules limiting, if necessary, the number of travellers admitted to Cashmere during the absence of the officer on special duty, strictly regulating the supply of labour which may be allowed for their occasional requirements, and duly providing for the ample remuneration by them of all such occasional labour.” [Proceedings, Political, August and November 1872, and January 1873.] [Secret, May 1876, Nos. 62-64, August 1877, Nos. 73-75.] 110. Orders placing the Officer on Special Duty in Cash mere in direct subordination to the Government of India- Since the year 1849 the political relations of the British Government with the Maharaja of Cashmere have been conducted by the Government of the Punjab aeting under the general control of the Supreme Government. But this arrangement appeared to the Government of India incompatible with the altered circumstances of the present day. The course of events on the external frontiers of Cashmere has given increasfed importance to these rela tions, and cases might arise at any moment requiring the immediate orders of the Supreme Government, and in which the delay inevitable under the existing arrangement might be injurious. The following orders were there fore passed placing the Officer on Special Duty in Cashmere in direct commu nication with the Supreme Government, and directing that the British Joint Commissioner at Leh should henceforward be subordinate to him. It was ruled that— the Officer on Special Duty in Cashmere shall he placed under the immediate order? of the Government of India in the Foreign Department, and shall correspond directly with that Department regarding trans-frontier affairs and other political matters of Imperial concern. In matters of local or provincial interest, such as the extradition of criminals; disputes ielating to waif timber, and other questions which can, if necessary, be more particularly defined hereafter, the Government of the Punjab can continue to correspond directly with the Lashmeie Durbar, and such correspondence may, as decided by Lord Northbrook, be conducted ei er wi i t e Maharaja direct, or through the Maharaja’s Agent in attendance on the Punja Government, or through the Officer on Special Duty; but in the event of correspondence being conducted otherwise than through the Officer on Special Duty, the latter must be kept u v informed of all that passes. Arrangements will at the same time be made to keep the I unjab Government fully acquainted with the progress of events on the Cashmere border and matters of importance passing between the Officer on Special Duty and the Supreme Gov-9 ^ serious ^ 16 Goveraoiejtfii less kas calld if “ereduriogHe^ « of fte % '““tlieir posts effe tab leave of 4 Mere diiriiioi Motioned in anxious tb I n t •n tile onetoilii ritish olcertofe iss. andsulijeettoi; ng, if nectssairi officer on spili: icir occasional li occasional lab: Special Diitj: ivernmentilt ie BritisIGro by the Ootc® upreme Go® f India ii«f ie course of e® importer Is! iring the delay ,Hewing orte 5 - fashmere ia fe &gt;tiag thatic^ bordinate to These arrangements were communicated to the Maharaja in the following khureeta from His Excellency, dated 14th May 1877 :— 1 “ I do myself the honor of transmitting-, for the information of Your Highness, copy of a letter which I have caused to be addressed to the Government of the Punjab, intimating that henceforth the relations of the British Government with Your Highness will in all matters of importance be conducted by the Officer on Special Duty under the immediate orders of the Government of India. “ In making this communication I would wish Your Highness clearly to understand that this arrangement has been decided upon solely with a view of expediting the transaction of business and not with any intention of altering the position or enlarging the functions of the Officer on Special Duty, it is my hope therefore that this modification of official routine—-a modification which is made as much in the interest of the Cashmere State as of the British Government—will meet with Your High ness 5 approval and concurrence. “ In view of the change of system thus inaugurated, it is possible that Your Highness may desire to have a representative in attendance at the head-quarters of the Supreme Govern ment as well as upon His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab. Should such be the case, I need hardly say that it will give me the greatest pleasure to receive and recognise any confidential Agent Your Highness may appoint'.” [Political A., May 1877, Nos. 269-274.] This khureeta was supplemented by the following memorandum delivered to Hewan Gobind Sahai at Simla on the 20th July: “ Dewan Gobind Sahai has communicated to the Viceroy a message from His Highness on the subject of the recent change m the mode of conducting the communication between His Highness and the Government of India. a His Excellency regrets that any misunderstanding should have arisen as to the nature of the change which has been introduced. “ in point of fact the only change made is this, that whereas formerly any communication of political importance from His Highness to the Government of India or from the Viceroy to His Highness had to be made through the Punjab Government under the new system such communications will not pass through the Punjab Government, but be made directly to the Viceroy or to the Secretary in the Foreign Department. “ With regard to the channel of communication, it will be open to the Maharaja, as heretofore, to communicate with the V iceroy or Lieutenant-Governor as the case may be, that is to sav m matters of political importance with the Viceroy and in other matters with the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, either through his own representative in attendance at the bead-quarters of the Government of India or the Punjab, or through the Officer on Special Duty, whichever mode may in any case be most convenient or agreeable to His Highness.” In October last the Maharaja replied to these two communications and said— a There is no doubt whatever that the apprehended change and the possibility of the Officer on Special Dutv being the medium of communication between the two Governments would have caused serious anxieties in my mind; but all such apprehensions have been lemoved by the memorandum dated 20th July last, written and forwarded to me under Your Excellency s kind order in which it is clearly stated that no alteration or increase m the position or autho- ritv of the Officer on Special Duty will take place either at the present or at any future time, and that the only change made is this that, whereas formerly any communication of poli tical importance from me to the Government of India or from \ our Excellency to me had to he made through the Punjab Government, under the new system, such communications will not pass through the Punjab Government, but be made directly to lour Excellency,. no other change whatever being made in the channel of communication. “ As I am ever ready to act in compliance with Your Excellency^ wishes, I entertain every hope that the assurances which Your Excellency gave me verbally at Madhopoor and expressed hr clear terms in the Sunnud, dated 22nd December 1876, will influence Your Excellency s Government in deciding upon any measure affecting the dignity and integnty ot my State. « As t0 ^ reason o{ the change now introduced, viz., the importance of the necessity for avoiding all delay in the communication of important informations to Your Excel ency through the Government of the Punjab, 1 think it is known full well to Your Excellency that in view to the importance of all news regarding the frontiers reaching Your Excellency s Government without any delay, I have of my own accord commenced the construction of a line of telegraph within my State, so that the news reaching here can he truasmitted to Your Excellency without any loss of time.( 184 ) It was observed that the words cited by the Mabaiaja from the memoran. dum of the 20tk July were not to be found either in that or in any othei communication from the Government of India to His Highness and it ^ considered that the misquotation was of sufficient impoitance to deserve forma} correction. Accordingly His Excellency the Viceroy in writing to condole rrit^ the Maharaja on the death of his son proceeded as follows— “ The particular words quoted in your letter from my memorandum of the 20th J u ] v last do not occur in that memorandum, nor in any letter addressed by me to Your Highness But while I wish this misquotation to be corrected, I beg to assure Your Highness that I have no desire or intention to increase the position 01 authority of the Officer on Special Duty at your Court, and that I share your opinion that any change in the status or functions of that officer would under present circumstances be inexpedient. Your Highness may rest assured that in all matters of this kind the Government of India will never act without due regard to your wishes and feelings, and I trust that I have, already given proof of my sincere desire to render the relations between the British Government and Your Highness in all respects conducive to the increased dignity, importance and independence of your State. The Maharaja in a letter dated 11th February 1878 intimating his selec tion of He wan Gobind Sakai as Agent in attendance on the Government of India has acknowledged that his quotation was incorrect and that as a matter of fact the words in question had not been used. \_8ecret, March 1878, Nos. 214-2*21.] 111. Telegraph communication between Srinuggur and Gilgit and Srinuggur and Jummoo— At the meeting at Madhopoor in November 1876 between His Excellency the Viceroy and the Maharaja of Cashmere the question was discussed of constructing a line of tel graph to Gilgit, so that Government might obtain early and constant information of the state of affairs in that direction. In the spring of 1877 Major Henderson, the Officer on special duty in Cashmere, reported that the Maharaja contemplated the immediate connection of Gilgit with the British telegraph system; that he had engaged the services of a Native Superintendent, and proposed to contract with Messrs. Jessop and Co. of Calcutta for the supply of wire. It was considered that no political objections existed to the proposed line being constructed and worked by the Maharaja. Such an arrangement would save the British Government all expense and also the chance of unpleasantness and friction between its officers and those of the Cashmere State. Sir Andrew Clarke who was consulted leplied m favor of the project. He said that the Telegraph Department would welcome any feeder to its lines which would not increase its capital outlay, and t rat it would specially welcome an extension into Cashmere. But lie observed that the proposed line would be a costly and difficult one, as it would ia\ e to cross a summit level of 13,000 feet, and would suffer every winter and spring irom frost and thaw. The usual convention would have to be entered m o retween the two Governments to determine a tariff of charges and empower re wo a ministrations to collect money, &amp;c., the one for the other. Sir n lew s e ei was sent to Major Henderson with an intimation that His jxcc ency ie Viceroy agreed with the views therein expressed. • 29th of March 1877 Major Henderson reported that the Mafia- RrifioW i ( ni b 0Km y abandoned the project for connecting Cashmere witfitfie ^ f egiapr system and intended for the present to construct a line betweea VUV', 1 f“ d p 1 !? 14 °? y-.with an intermediate station at Astor.

The necessary orders were issued to comply with these several suggestions. Meantime, Major Henderson wrote again intimating that His Highness was anxious to extend the line to Jummoo and to see both sections of it, viz., that from Gilgit to Srinuggur, and that from the latter place to Jummoo, commenced simultaneously and at an early date. Correspondence then ensued regarding the cost of the line, which re sulted in the Maharaja accepting an estimate of Rupees 40,000 for the section between Gilgit and Srinuggur, and one of Rupees 21,600 for the section between Srinuggur and Jummoo. And a Native officer of sufficient experience to superintend the construction of a difficult line across the moun tains between Srinuggur and Gilgit not being available, the work was entrusted to Mr. Duthy, Assistant Superintendent, Telegraph Department. A second officer could not be spared, and hence the Maharaja’s wish for the simultaneous con struction of both sections of .the line could not he complied with. Consider able delay also ensued in settling the terms of the convention between the British Government and the Maharaja. Eventually, however, the following agreement was accepted and formally executed on 9th March 1878 :— Agreement entered into beUveen the British Government and the Cashmere State in regard to the construction of Telegraph Lines from Jummoo to Srinuggur and from Srinuggur to Gilgit. “Whereas His Highness the Maharaja of Cashmere is desirous of obtaining the assist ance of the British Government towards the construction of lines of telegraph from Jummoo to Srinugguir and from Srinuggur to Gilgit, the following terms are agreed upon hy Major Philip Durham Henderson, C.S.I., Officer on special duty in Cashmere, on the part of the British Government, duly empowered by the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council on that behalf, and by Baboo Nilumber Mookerjee, M.A., B.L., Judge of the Sadr Adalut of Cashmere, duly empowered by His Highness the Maharaja on that behalf. “ I.—The British Government agrees to construct for the Cashmere State two lines of telegraph, each consisting of one wire, to he carried on such suitable supports as are procurable in the vicinity, the one to be erected between Jummoo and Srinuggur at a cost of Rupees 21,600, more or less, and the other between Srinuggur and Gilgit at a cost of Rupees 31,900, more or less, provided in each ease the following conditions are observed :— “ («.) That the transport of all telegraph materials from Sialkote to the Cashmere frontier and within the limits of the Cashmere State, shall be directly arranged and paid for by some duly authorized officer of the Cashmere State. “ ( 5 .) That all laborers whom the officer in charge of the construction of the line shall require to employ, shall he engaged and paid by a duly authorized officer of the Cashmere State. “ (&lt;?.) That on due notice being given hy the officer in charge of the construction of the line the Cashmere Government shall to the utmost of its power comply with requisitions foi transport or labor. “ (fh) That sound seasoned deodar posts, wherever these are procurable, suitable for tele- o-raph supports, shall be provided by the Cashmere State and distributed along the route to be taken by the telegraph lines in such manner as the officer in charge of the work may direct. “ [e.) That no brackets or insulators be used in the construction of the lines, as their cost has not been provided in the estimated amounts stated above. jj The British Government guarantees that all telegraph materials, including the wire supplied by it, shall he of the best quality used for its own lines, and that the lines shall be handed over tp the Cashmere Government in full working order. « JXX His Highness the Maharaja agrees to pay to the British Government, as the money may be required, the actual cost incurred by it in the construction and establishment of the lines, such cost being inclusive of &lt;( n ) The salaries and allowances of all members of the Indian lelegraph Establish- menc for the whole period they may be detained on duty in Cashmere; and cc m.) The cost of insulating the line or of any other changes in the original scheme that may he made hereafter with the concurrence, or at the request, of the Cashmere State. «iy. The salaries and allowances of all members of the Indian Telegraph Establishment will he paid to them by the Government of India through the officer on special duty, and the amounts of such payments will be recovered subsequently from the Cashmere State. «y. On the application in writing of the Cashmere State, the Telegraph Department will supply at cost price all telegraph instruments and material required from time to time for the maintenance and working of the telegraph lines and offices about to be established.( 186 ) «VL— On the application in writing o£ the Cashmere State the telegraph Department will afford such advice and instruction as may be required and desired by the Cashmere State for the maintenance and working of such telegraph lines and offices. « VII. —On the application in writing of the Cashmere State the Telegraph Department will lend the services of any native signallers who may volunteer for the duty, and whose services can be spared for such specified periods as may be sufficient to enable the Cashmere State to train its own signallers. « VIII. The foregoing provisions are accepted by the British Government as a mark of friendship and good-will towards His Highness the Maharaja, but it is to be understood that after the lines are delivered over to the Cashmere Government, no responsibility whatever attaches to the British Government in respect of then subsequent maintenance and working,” The construction of the section of the line between Jummoo and Srinuggur is being rapidly prosecuted, but work between Srinuggur and Gilgit, where the line has advanced as far as the Doiikun 1 ass, has been suspended pending a consideration of the means to be adopted, to overcome the physical difficulties and to ensure the future stability of the line. In a note, dated the 14th of January 1878, the Director-General of Telegraphs pointed out the risk during the winter months from the falling of avalanches, trees, and boulders, which fill the gorges to a depth of from 70 to 80 feet. To protect the line from these dangers the Maharaja had suggested the use in places of an insulated under ground wire, but the Director postponed offering his opinion until the effects of avalanches, &amp;c., during the present winter on the part of the line already constructed* had been ascertained. He also suggested that before work was recommenced the onward route from the Dorikun Pass to Gilgit should he examined and Major Henderson was directed to advise the Maharaja according ly. In the meantime the Maharaja’s intention to abandon the present road between Srinuggur and Astor, and to open an entirely new line of road to the latter place the &lt;£ Sharida” route became known. Major Henderson there fore suggested that the telegraph line should also run along this new road, and the Maharaja after considering the expense involved in the change of plan agreed and expressed a wish for the dismantlement of the portion of the line already carried to the Dorikun Pass and its removal to the “ Sharida” route. But it has been decided that before any further steps are taken in the matter Mr. Duthy shall examine the new route and report on its prac ticability for telegraph purposes, and also the onward road from Astor to Gilgit, It will then be determined whether the line between Srinuggur and Astor shall go the Sharida route or by the “Zohal” road, or by the Jotkissun and the Dorikun Pass as at present, a partially under-ground line being adopted t Correspondence ending with letter from Major where neCCSSary.f One objection tO the Henderson, No. 174, dated 15th February 1878.

The Maharaja will, however, arrange for the protection of the line if it is erected on this route. remains to say that the Maharaja contemplates joining his line to the British system at Sialkote, and that the matter is under consideration in the 1 ublic M orks Department. \_Genl.

The portion of the road be tween Jotkissun and the Dorikun Pass is said to be the really difficult portion of the route between Srinuggur and Gilgit, the rest is believed to be com paratively easy.

[See Chapter VIII of Mr. Henvey’s Central Asia Precis, 1872-75.] 112. Mr. R. B. Shaw’s proceedings in Kashgar in 1874-75 prior to his return to India. Affairs of the Central Asia Trading Company. —On the 5th January 1875 Mr. Shaw and Dr. Scully returned from Kashgar to Yarkund and w r ere cordially received on the following day by the Dadkhwah. They noticed that the various officials were more frank and open with them than on former occasions. Pull liberty was given to them to visit the interior of the country on shooting excursions, and much hospitality and kindness was extended to them. Dr. Scully’s medical operations were very satisfactory. The attendance at his dispensary was large, and no opposition was met with on the part of the authorities. Many of the patients were women. The reports submitted by Mr. Shaw during his stay at Yarkund chiefly deal with various phases of the affairs of the Central Asia Trading Company. Mr. Russell, the Manager, complained of pressure being laid on the merchants to prevent their buying from him, the object being to compel him to sell his goods cheaply to the authorities. At an interview with the Dadkhwah, Mr. Shaw mentioned the subject. He pointed out the advantage of permitting Mr. Russell to trade with whom he pleased, which would show that the Ameer really cared to protect merchants in his dominions and would have a good effect. 'Whether Mr. Russell made a profit or not was a matter of luck. So long as he was allowed to deal freely in the open market there could be no cause for complaint. But if a merchant’s goods w^ere bought up by officials at a less rate than he asked, ill-disposed persons would be apt to attribute this to unfair pressure. The Dadkhwah fully assented to these views. For a day or two trade matters seemed to progress more favorably, and Mr. Russell acted on the Dadkhwah’s advice to send ventures to Kashgar and Aksu. But on a report being received that his goods at Kashgar had been taken out of the hands of his agent and placed in the store-room of four of the principal merchants, Mr. Russell took offence and asked for a pass to enable him to return to Ladak. He believed that the authorities were actively interfering with the sale of his property. Upon this Mil. Shaw appealed to the Dadkhwah, who denied that any pressure had been used, and urged Mr. Shaw to suggest the course he shotdd pursue. The latter with some reluctance said that if°the merchants were afraid to buy lest they should enter into com petition wdth the Ameer’s Government, perhaps the best thing to do would he to let it be known publicly that the merchants had no cause to entertain such fears and might buy as they chose. The Dadkhwah agreed and issued a notice saying that persons buying Mr. Russell’s goods would please the Dad khwah. He thus went beyond Mr. Shaw’s wishes. Nevertheless, Mr. Russell ap peared to retain his opinion that his goods did not sell well because the authorities interfered. But Mr. Shaw thought that the high prices asked prevented the wholesale merchants from making a profit, a circumstance which w ould account for their holding back. The Government of India on receiving these reports approved generally of Mr Shaw’s action. But they considered that he would do well to abstain from officially complaining to the Yarkund authorities of the obstructions said to be placed in Mr. Russell’s way until he had satisfied himself that there had been an actual infraction of the spirit of the Commercial Treaty. (Foreign Department No. 1189P., dated 29th April 1875.)( 188 ) Mr. Russell’s proceedings continued to give trouble. He asked for and obtained passes for himself and his Ruiopean Assistants to go to Kbotan, Aksu, and Kashghar. But he changed his mind so often as to annoy the Dadkbwah, who was perplexed as to the icpoit he should make to the Ameer. Next there was a dispute about some guns and ammunition which Mr. Russell said the Dadkhwah having agreed to buy, had afterwards repudiated his bargain. The repudiation apparently amounted to a denial of agreement to purchase. The Dadkhwah represented that he was merely a servant of the Ameer to whom he had referred the matter, and that pending definite orders he was unable to buy the goods. Mm fehaw was not satisfied that any purchase had been agreed upon, and declined to interfere, pending submission by Mr. Russell of a statement of the facts upon which he relied, Further correspondence showed that Mr. Russell displayed great want of tact in his trading affairs, and that both sides were anxious to induce Mr. Shaw to act as a sort of commercial go-between, a position which he declined to assume, The affairs of the Trading Company and Mr. Shaw’s proceedings in relation thereto are of no particular interest and will not be further adverted to. {Secret, July 7875, Nos. 169-185.] 113. Detention of Punjabee Artizans in Kashgar .-Shadi Meerza, the first Envoy from Kashuar to the Government of India, took back with him in 1870 eight Punjab blacksmiths as gunmakers. In August 1875 these persons presented a petition to Mr. Shaw complaining of ill-treatment, of having never received any pay, and of being prevented from returning to India. Mr. Shaw reported that the Dadkhwah had promised to raise no objection to the men leaving Kashgar, that they were well treated and had saved money. The Government of India directed Mr. Shaw to remind the Dadkhwah of his promise to let the men go, and they were released in February 1876. {Secret, March 1876, Nos. 97-101.] 114. Mr. Shaw returns to India. Report of his Mission and of the political situation in Kashgar. —It will be remembered that the orders issued by the Government of India to Mr. Shaw, dated 19th September 1874, directed him to return to India after the completion of his mission in regard to the Treaty unless the Ameer expressed a decided wish that he should remain. These instructions w T ere repeated from time to time and eventually Mr. Shaw was directed to press for the Ameer’s promised ratification. On the 8th April the following conversation passed between him and the Yarkund Envoy. The latter said— • J° U as ^ e ^ ^ or a ratification of the Treaty from the Ameer. ‘It is of course most desirable that you should be here to convey the friendly sentiments of the Ameer to His xcellency the Viceroy, and vice versa, but as our Envoy has now gone to Constantinople, do you think it would he best to wait till his return before completing the arrangement toi yom residence here, and that of our representative at Calcutta/ I replied that the two matters were distinct: a treaty had been concluded, and His xce ency e Viceioy had shown his approval of it by sending his ratification j it now remaint or e Ameer to do the same. Such a document I had orders to receive, buttlie ques ion o a esident was one for the two Governments to decide, and about which I had no oi cr, m ac my instructions were to return to India after receiving the ratification when the Vtnor u fTY 1 ™ replled: ‘Undoubtedly you would have to obey the orders of ^ ™ iat are n ow anxious to ascertain is, what course would be most agreeah Z U ? y ’ h f J ; 0U Sh0uld 8ta y C” “S Resident, or that the return of byud should be awaited.

He observed that the season was advancing, and it was desirable that he should know when he might expect to receive the ratification in order that he might make pre paration for going. The Dadkhwah replied that he was about to start for Kashgar, where the ratification would be the first business which he would arrange with the Ameer. The Dadkhwah returned to Yarkund on the 18th June and told Mr. Shaw that the Ameer had said that the friendship between the two Governments had been confirmed by the Treaty of 1874, that it had been settled that on the return of Syud Yakoob Khan from Turkey, resident Envoys should be exchanged. Meanwhile, with regard to the ratification which Mr. Shaw had brought he would undoubtedly receive in reply a docu ment from the Ameer which he might have whenever he liked. On the 24th July Mr. Shaw received what he believed to be the promised letter of ratification from the Ameer. It was unaccompanied by any invitation to remain in the country, and therefore IVlr. Shaw, in accordance with his instructions, made arrangements for immediate departure, and left Yarkund on the 29th July. This letter from the Ameer to the Viceroy was dated July 1875 and was sub mitted by Mr. Shaw in Eebruary 1876. After compliments it proceeded :— “ The identity of interests which exists between us requires that no defect should occur on my part in the relations of our friendship. It may not (or let it not) remain concealed that the friendly letter of ratification, which Your Excellency was pleased to send through your Vakeel Mr. Shaw to establish friendship between the two States in regard to the improvement of mercantile concerns between the two countries, reached me at an agreeable and auspicious moment. Its friendly contents, which came fully to my knowledge, added greatly to my joy and gratification, more especially the news of your good health. It afforded me a fresh delight. Besides this, I feel confident that Your Excellency will continually inform me of your good health as it will set my mind perfectly at ease. “ I have granted leave to the above Vakeel to return ; he has been residing here up to this time since his arrival. He will intimate to Your Excellency that I am in good health.^ Here it may be observed that Mr. Shaw neither delivered to the Ameer the copy of the Treaty which had been ratified by Lord Northbrook, nor did he bring away the Ameer’s ratification in exchange. At his interview with the Ameer at Kashgar on the 22nd October 1874 he presented Lord Northbrook’s letter ratifying the Treaty, but not the Treaty itself. And from the Ameer he received only the letter above cited. He explained :— “ Knowing the uncertain business habits of the people of Central Asia, I considered it best, before carrying out the formal exchange of the two identical copies of the treaty, to obtain first from His Highness the Ameer the essential document of ratification, lest I should be left for an indefinite time without either of the copies of the Treaty and without any other document in their place. Although His Highness at once promised his ratification and again at my parting interview said that I should get it at Yarkund, yet after a while it became evident that they were putting off its delivery to an indefinite period. Under these circumstances to hand over the copy of the Treaty in my possession before the delivery of any document from the Ameer would have been to run the risk of a similar uncertainty about the receipt of the exchange copy. Even to declare my wish to exchange the copies would have led to a request for the delivery of the one in my possession which I could not then have withheld without appearing to doubt the AmeeEs honor. It became my chief anxiety to obtain the actual ratification by His Highness. “ When at last the letter of ratification arrived it was under such circumstances as made it a kind of last word, having been delayed till I was about to start. The speedy delivery of the ratification in order that I might return to India having been urged by myself in accordance with my instructions, I thought it undesirable to interpose further delays before my departure in order to carry out a formality which to them would seem a mere excuse for staying on longer in the country, I have therefore contented myself with bringing away His Highness’ letter of ratification. “ I can only trust that I shall not be thought to have done wrong by taking on myself the responsibility of coming away without demanding more than I have done.. I may add that my objection against seeming to linger at the last (after receipt of he ratification) was not any anticipated dislike on the part of the Kashgar authorities to such a course (for I believe their chief desire throughout has been to gain time without committing themselves) ; but the fear on my own part lest such a course should not seem in accordance with the dignity( 190 ) of the British Government as whose representative I had been instructed to make no attempt to stay on unless 1 were pressed to do so by the Ameer himself. What I desired to avoid „ B giving an excuse for fresh delays. In due course Mr. Shaw submitted a report of his proceedings and also a memorandum on the political situation m Southern lurkestan which are printed in extenso in Appendix XIV. It is sufficient to observe here that the Government of India considered that under circumstances of some difficulty Mr. Shaw had showed judgment and discretion in the discharge of the duty entrusted to him, in which opinion the Secretary of State iully concurred. [ Secret, July 1876, Nos. 29-32.] 115. Sir D. Forsyth’s Confidential Report of his Mission to Yarkund. With Mr. Shaw’s return to India the proceedings which consti tute the immediate outcome of the Yarkund Mission of 1S/3 came to a close. But before taking up the history of more recent e\ents in Kashgar it will be convenient to notice Sir Douglas Forsyth s confidential icpoit of his Mission and the action taken upon it. Sir D. Forsyth was desired to submit two reports of his operations—one was intended for publication and need not be here referred to. The other was for confidential use, and contained (1) Sir D. Forsyth’s own reports. (2) Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon’s military reports. (3) Captain Biddulph’s military reports. (4) Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon’s report on the Pamir and Makhan. (5) Captain Chapman’s report on the officers of the Ameer’s Court, &amp;e. Of these Nos. (1) and (3) will fie found in Appendices XY and XVI; extracts from Nos. (2) and (4) have already been included in Appendix XII, and No, (5) has been separately printed. Certain statements in Sir. D. Forsyth’s own reports attracted the special attention of the Government of India. Writing on the relations between Europeans and Natives of India, and the want of sympathy between the two races, he observed :— “ These things done between ourselves and the people of India are bad enough, but they are worse when practised towards Asiatics who owe us no allegiance and are mere travellers through India, or are the guests of our Government. Syud Yakoob Khan is a gentleman ia every sense of the word, yet, when he first passed through India, he was subjected to serious annoyance. Ihrar Khan who came down to India as Envoy had to submit to rough treat ment, of which he does not cease to complain, and which he, far different to the Syud, tried to retaliate upon us. Fortunately the recent orders of His Excellency regarding the proper treatment of Envoys will remove all possible complaint as regards them in future.^ Eurther on he touched upon Cabul and Cashmere politics. **** * *** a So long as the mistaken idea was held that the Pamir was really the 1 roof of the world and quite impassable for troops, it mattered little how far Kashmir penetrated in that direction, or who held the petty principalities on the Hindoo-Kush. But as the mists of ignorance are gradually being dissipated, we are brought face to face with facts and are compelled to acknowledge danger from a quarter whence we have a right to expect loyal assistance/’ * . * * * * * ** I may mention, quantum valeat, a piece of information given me by Faiz Bus, that Ameer Shere Ah has been receiving moneys from the Maharaja secretly, for I presume that the sanction of the Government of India has not been obtained. I was given by Syud Yakoob Khan to understand that the secret friendship between Shere Ali and the Maharaja was not conducive to our interests.” ******** . “ The state o£ affahs in Cabul favors this line of policy. Shere Ali has quarrelled with £ -d 108 ^- S ° n ^akoob Khan, and if that youth should, as is most probable, seek the ai or Russia, he will have the sympathies of more than half Shere AlFs kingdom.

He also corresponds with the Maharaja of Kashmir, as I have already officially reported on the authority of Syud Yakoob Khan. If then Shere Ali finds his provinces on the north and south and west falling away to rivals who are under Russian influence, and if it he true that the English alliance is so unpopular in Cahul, then it would not be a matter of surprise it, to save himself, he threw himself into the arms of Russia. I am now giving the view of the case as presented to me by Syud Yakoob Khan, which has received corroboration from the information brought by Ressaidar Afzul Khan, Ibrahim Khan, and by Abdul Subhan, all three of whom worked entirely separate and could not possibly have ^colluded in making their enquiries. All sources of information produce the same story, that Russian agents have been over in Balkh, and Abdul Subhan says one has lately come to Cahul, and that Naib Alum Khan, the Ameer's most trusted Lieutenant, openly expressed his pre ference for Russia, and that the talk of the people is how they will get on with the Russians when they come. - ” In calling upon Sir Douglas to explain these statements (Eoreign Depart ment No. 2213P., dated 8th October 1874) the Government of India observed that they were not aware of the circumstances under which Syud Yakoob Khan had been subjected to serious annoyances. He passed through India in 1870 on his return from Constantinople, where he had gone as an Envoy from Kokand several years previous to the establishment of the Atalik Ghazee’s .authority in Yarkund. On that occasion he came to India provided with letters from the British Minister at Constantinople. He was treated as an honored guest, and was furnished with letters and presents for the Atalik Ghazee. They now learnt for the first time that the Syud had any cause of complaint. As to Ihrar Khan the matter complained of arose out of an unfor tunate mistake. Definite information was also asked for regarding “ the danger from a quarter whence we have a right to expect loyal assistance,” and Eaiz Bux w^as to be called upon to verify his assertion that the Ameer of Cabul had been receiving money secretly from the Maharaja of Cashmere. The allusion made by Synd Yakoob Khan to the secret friendship between the Ameer of Cahnl and the Maharaja, and the reference to the “ outspoken words of warning given in Kashgar,” w^ere also, if possible to be explained. With regard to Abdool Ha liman’s correspondence wuth the Ameer of Kashgar, Sir Douglas had mentioned in a letter, dated 16th May 1874, on the authority of Syud Yakooh Khan, that an agent from Abdool Bahman to Cash- mere was then passing through Kashgar, whose movements he would watch. The result of these observations, as well as any information regarding this emissary, was asked for. Finally the facts reported by Bessaldar Afzul Khan, Ibrahim Khan, and Abdool Soobhan, to which Mr. Forsyth had referred as corroborative of Syud Yakoob Khan’s opinion as to the Hussian proclivities of the Ameer of Cabul, were demanded. And enquiry was made as to who the Hussian agents were who were stated to have made their appearance in Balkh and Cabul, whether Sir Douglas’ informants spoke from personal knowTedge, and whether they could state with any confidence what was the object of these Agents’ visit. In replying to this call Sir Douglas Forsyth referred to Mr. H. B. Shaw as his authority for saying that when Synd Yakoob Khan arrived in India in 1869, not in 1870, and came to Umritsur, he had been subjected to some indignity. The circumstances had come to Lord Mayo’s knowledge who had thereupon despatched Mr. Shaw to ITmritsur, with presents and a letter, and arrangements had been made for the Syud’s proper treatment. Further during the journey to Yarkund in 1870, the Synd had not unfrequently mentioned the subject to Sir D. Forsyth, and, at the time of parting had expressed a wish that the Native official who had offended should not he punished. In deference to this request, Sir D. Forsyth had abstained from submitting a formal report on the matter, though he had mentioned it to Lord Mayo. On the question of “ the danger from a quarter whence we have a right to expect loyal assistance,” Sir D. Forsyth referred to Colonel Gordon s military report on Kashgar, the Pamirs, and Wakhan, and Captain Biddulph s report on the Chitral Passes.( 192 ) He continued:— “ This so far as the military question is concerned, may be considered acceptable. It is not unreasonable to suppose that if actual troops do not come, we may have to provide against emissaries making their way across and influencing t c boidei tribes who are known to be hostile to us. 4 “ This brings me to the remark in my report that we are compelled to acknowledge danger from a quarter^whence we ought to expect loyal assistance, and the succeeding paragraph explains the meaning of this sentence to be,_ that the Cashmere Government throws every obstacle in the way of our becoming acquainted with the countiy and people between Gilgit and the Hindoo-Kush. « r pbe fact of the country beyond Gilgit being almost a sealed book, to any Government official travelling otherwise than in strict incognito is notorious. Captain Biddulph, who has doubtless carefully weighed what he has written, says— f With regard to the Gilgit frontier, it is to be noticed that the Cashmere officials have shown a marked dislike to any British officer travellino- in that direction. Among the many who visit Cashmere each year, there are always some who are ready to seek for new hunting grounds; but directly their steps are turned towards Giffiit, every effort is made to discourage the attempt, supplies and carriage are procured with difficulty, local information is studiously withheld, and game is systematically driven away. I have even heard it said that no Englishman has ever been^allowed to travel on the direct road from Srinuggur to Gilgit which is open all the year round. “ This statement I believe to be perfectly correct, and, in my humble, judgment, the oppo sition encountered by travellers, which is referred to, is due to a determination on the part of the Cashmere Government to prevent us from becoming acquainted with the relations existing between the Maharaja and the tribes across the border, and to stop us from acquiring influence amongst them. “ This in itself is a source of danger.” In regard to the information given him by Eaiz Bux, Sir D. Forsyth had questioned that person as to the sources whence it had been derived. Eaiz Bax said that he was in constant correspondence with a news-writer (Mahomed Ishak alias Abdul Huk) in Cabul, who was in the pay of the Punjab Govern ment. In this particular instance Paiz Bux had no other authority for his statement than the reports of his agents. Paiz Bux had long been a recog nized channel of information, what he was worth the Government of India could judge. In mentioning what Paiz Bux had said Sir D. Forsyth had specially remarked that it should be accepted quantum valeat, and had in no way endorsed it. With reference to the secret friendship alluded to by Syud Yakoob Khan, Sir Douglas referred to paragraphs 14 and 31 of his confidential letter No. 163, dated Yarkund, 16th May, in which he had mentioned the opinions expressed by the Syud. On a subsequent occasion the Syud had recurred to the subject and as Sir Douglas was well aware that he was thoroughly master of the subject he placed reliance on his “opinions,” experience having proved that the Syud did not rashly advance his views, though he might decline to be categori cally questioned regarding them. As to the alleged presence of Russian Agent at Cabul Sir Douglas referred again to paragraphs 6 and 7 of his letter dated 16th May and to Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon’s political and military report on Sirikol, the Pamirs and Wakhan, page 8, in which he says that one of the first remarks made by Puttek Ali Shah was that a Russian had lately visited Mahomed Alum at Tukhtapool, and was believed to have gone on to Cabul. Abdul Subhan also had distinctly told Sir Douglas that he saw a Russian in Cabul, and that Naib Alum openly professed his preference for the Russians. He was unable to give any further information on the subject. TV ith regard to this explanation it will be sufficient to quote here the following despatch (No. 22, elated 21st June 1875) to the Secretary of State which shows the light in which the Government of India of the day regarded Sir D. Forsyth’s opinions :— Y' reference to our despatch No. 24, dated 17th April 1874, reporting the termination or the kte missmn to Yarkund, and the repiy of Her MajestVs Government, No. H, dated Ibth June 1874 we have the honor to submit a collection of the confidential papers notedm the enclosed Abstract of Contents relating to the state of affairs in the dominions of the Ameer of Kashgar.I 11 'lilt It ^irste^, carriage * s jstmatii i. allowed toy,. 1 Mejajot; a determioaiiip. ied with tie i : opusfroma0je. zBux,SirI),li ibeeademeii had long k he GoTemml aid Sh l fc turn i by Syndic lonfidentialtt d the opiniif 1 recumd to I thorouglily®'; ice having f* jht decline toh it at CataHi dateilfl^ port on Si* 1 e Hist n'*; 1 fflcienttff to fc ( 193 ) fir These papers contain much that is interesting and valuable from a geographical^ politi cal, and military point of view; but we consider that those statements of opinion which are not substantiated by ascertained facts or which rest on uncorroborated native testimony should be received with caution and reserve. “We would here invite attention to letter No. 2213P., dated 8 th October 1874, addressed to Sir T. Douglas Forsyth, and his reply No. 329, dated 12 th October. “ As regards the annoyance to which Syud Yakoob, Envoy from Kashgar, is said to have been subjected in the course of his first journey through India, we have not thought it neces sary to make any reference to Mr. Shaw on the subject. Our records show that the Syud was treated as the honored guest of the British Government, that the deputation of Mr. Shaw to meet the Envoy at Umritsur was in no way connected with any discourtesy supposed to have been shown to him, and that the object of the Viceroy, the late Earl of Mayo, was simply to take advantage of the opportunity of the SyiuTs return from Constantinople for the purpose of re-opening communications with the Ameer of Kashgar. “ In paragraph 82 of his confidential report, when writing of the capabilities of the Pameer as a military route. Sir T. D. Forsyth referred to a danger which must be acknowledged from a quarter whence the British Government had a right to expect loyal assistance. The allu sion was to Cashmere : but we do not consider that the facts adduced support the statement made in the report. The danger caused by the obstacles thrown in the way of explorations in the direction of Gilgit is not a danger which we have been compelled to acknowledge in consequence of the Mission to Yarkund. Opposition to such explorations has been encountered .for many years, and may be accounted for in other ways than by supposing it to proceed from disloyalty on the part of the Cashmere authorities. “ Nor do we think that any evidence has been brought forward which would justify us in believing that suspicious pecuniary transactions have passed between Cashmere and Afghanistan, or that the two States maintain a secret friendship and mutual understanding, or that Sirdar Abdul Rahman Khan keeps up a correspondence with the Maharaja of Cashmere, or lastly, that the Ameer of Cabul has proclivities towards Russia, and that Russian Agents have visited Balkh and Cabul. “ It is not intended by the above remarks to imply that the information derived from current rumours or the conversation of irresponsible native observers possesses no value whatever. Nor do we suppose that any information so derived would stand the test of close and critical enquiry. But we consider that it is necessary to draw a marked distinction between facts which have been ascertained and established by competent testimony, and those reports and suggestions which may or may not be worthy of consideration, according to the character and credibility of the person communicating them. “We shall have the opportunity of acquainting Her Majesty's Government with our sen timents at large on the results obtained by the Mission to Yarkund, when the general report now shortly to be published, has been laid before us.' In reply, the Secretary of State having endorsed the approval bestowed upon the officers named, added :— “ The statements made to Sir Douglas Forsyth by native informants with respect to the proceedings of the Ameer of Cabul are of great importance. It would not be fair, as Your Excellency suggests, to form conclusions adverse to the Ameer upon evidence, the value of which cannot be tested. But there are portions of his present conduct, with which these suspicions appear to be not inconsistent. It is therefore very desirable that, without betraying your acquaintance with them, you should lose no opportunity of ascertaining how far they are justified by the fact.' But the Government of India did not see their way to taking any further steps to test the accuracy of the rumours in question. [Secret, January 1876, No. 107.] 116. Syud Yakoob Khan, the Yarkund Envoy, at Con stantinople. —Yakoob Khan, whose proceedings in Calcutta in the cold weather of 1871-75 are fully detailed in Mr. Henvey’s precis, sailed from Bombay on the 10th March 1875. He was detained some time at Constantinople, wait ing until the return presents from the Sultan were ready and until he had been honoured with another audience. Among other gifts the Sultan had promised 1,000 rifles for the Ameer of Kashgar, a circumstance which caused the Grand Vizier some uneasiness lest Bussia should take offence. It did give rise to some correspondence which is noticed in the succeeding paragraph. IN( 194 ) After leaving Constantinople, the Syud visited Russia and an interestino accduut of hi doings and reception there coupled by Captam Mollo.v froni various conversations, will be found m Appendix XVII, {Secret, June 1877, Nos. 94-95.] {Secret, July 1875, No. 42.] n 9 Tntprview between IVtr. ,Dori8&lt; 8/nd Synd. Y&amp;koob Tn,„i 17 ’ 0 tqt Petersburg in September 1875.-While the Syud w^afsfpetershm-tMr. bona, British Charge d’Afiau-es, called upon him, Syud Yakoob received him with much courtesy and in the course of convex tinn snoke freely of his desire to cultivate the best relations with England aud n„iin P and to avoid all grounds of offence to the latter. He mentioned that the wish of the Amir to maintain intimate relations with Turkey was viewed with great jealousy by the Russian Government After some delay he returned Mr. Doria’s visit. He appeared to be satisfied with his reception by the Czar ‘iltliouo’h His Maiesty had treated him somewhat haughtily. The Czar had said that he was desirous of the Ameer of Kashgar s prosperity and of the tranquillity of his country as long as he maintained a friendly course of actioa towards Russia, but that he should beware of* committing any act of hostility, directed against Russia, which would certainly be avenged. Ihe Syudap- neared much impressed by the excessive hatred (“ hatred is the word he makes use of) which exists on the part of Russia towards both England and Turkey. He repeated that he had believed that there was no friendship existing towards England hut that he was not prepared for such extreme hostility. The question’of the appointment by Russia of a resident Envoy in Kashgar was to be referred to General Kauffmann, and the Syud intended to return to liis own country via Tashkend to enable him to have an interview with the General on the subject. According to the views of Syud Yakooh, the stability of Russia s prosGiit conquests in Central Asia was as precarious as her rule was execrated. He described the population as oppressed by excessive taxation. Where formerly they had hut one tax (the tithe) to pay to their Native. Rulers, they had to pay three taxes to their recent conquerors, and he considered that if a war with Russia afforded the opportunity, her power in Central Asia would be overthrown, and her troops be massacred. Remarks made from time to time by Baron Jomini to Mr. Horia led the latter to believe that there was some truth in the Syud’s observations. Mr. Horia added :— “ The power to excite the barbarous and lawless tribes of Central Asia against herself appears to be considered by Russia a power of offence in the hands of England, from which she is most apprehensive of danger to the maintenance of her hold on her possessions in Central Asia. “ Her own precept, however, Russia seems not to act on, as Syud Yakoob narrates to me that the Russian agents had endeavoured to persuade the Ameer of Kashgar to attack Badak* shan; but the Ameer, aware of their intention to create thereby hostility between himself,land the Ameer of Afghanistan, had wisely abstained from any sort of interference. Yakoob Khan represents Russia as most jealous of the relations of cordiality existing between his country . . and Turkey, and would fain embroil the understanding between Kasn- Ste m ong. gar and Afgbanistan a]g0&gt; “In my conversation with Syud Yakoob, I have confined my advice to follow the behests expressed by the Emperor of Russia to himself, to which allusion is made in the first part ol my despatch, and that in so doing every pertext for an attack by Russia on the Kashgar ter- Sic in orio- ritory would be best avoided and tend to the maintenance of the Ameer’s independence from Russian interference/' Mr. Horia subsequently heard that the Syud had applied both to the Bus- sian and the Turkish Governments for aid against China. The St. Petersburg authorities had referred him to General Kauffmann at Tashkend. The Envoy could not go to Tashkend, hut met General Kauffmann at Chemkend in Decembei 1875, and then went straight to Kashgar via Aulia Ata, Tomak, and Nary ns ^' {Secret, November 1875, Nos. 88 fy 94.] {Secret, December 1875, No. 66 .]118. Eelations between the Ameer cf Kashgar and the Sultan of Turkey, and rumour of a Mahomedan revival—The following paragraph appeared in the Russian Golos of 30th April (12th May) 1875:— “ The Turkestan Gazette reports from Kashgar : Last year Forsyth arrived at Kashgar accompanied by Turkish Agents. At present there are four of these Agents in Kashgar, the principal one is called Ibrahim Effendi. The Turks are accredited to Yakoob Beg for three years. It is reported thnt the Sultan's Agent has great influence over Yakoob Beg, and informs the Sultan of everything, particularly keeps the Porte well acquainted with Bussian trading operations in Kashgar. The Envoys of Yakoob Beg, Mahomed Zia and Mir Kasim, who were in Tashkend not long ago, had the sanction of the Turkish Agents to telegraph to the Turkish Ambassador in St. Petersburgh to ask for his protection in case of any misunderstanding arising in the payment of the indemnity to the merchant Somof. As regards the name of the Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz appearing on the Kashgar coins ; and several other facts pointing to the protec torate of Turkey over Kashgar, there are rumours among the people that the Ruler of Kashgar has placed himself under the protection of Turkey in order that after his death the nomination of a successor should depend upon the Sultan. The latter is supposed to be obliged to intercede in all misunderstandings between the Russian Government and Jityshahr. In this way the Kashgarians consider the Turkish Padishah as their Sultan, and at present Yakoob Beg is regarded as representing the Turkish Government.' Upon these remarks the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg observed :— “ From several circumstances which have lately come to my knowledge, it would appear that a general understanding is concerting among all Mussulmen to look to the Sultan of Turkey as their Caliph, with a view to form by collective action a strong bulwark of defence for Islamism and to bring about a Mussulman revival. This fusion and alliance of the Mus sulman races may be productive of important results in all Christian countries possessing a Mussulman population, and especially as regards the large Mussulman population of India, and is deserving therefore of attention. In one of the Secret papers I forwarded to Your Lord- ship last winter, reference was made to a Committee of Agents from the several Mussulman States, who were in the habit of meeting at Constantinople and of discussing secretly questions concerning their mutual interests. Your Lordship will also have observed of late the frequency of missions to the Sultan from Kashgar, Bokhara, and other Mussulman States.' [ Secret, July 1875, Nos. 193-196.] 119. Arms and Ammunition presented by the Sultan of Turkey to the Ameer of Kashgar. Turkish Military Instruc tors in Kashgar. —Early in November 1875 the Bombay Government forwarded, for orders, copy of a letter from the Turkish Consul-General re specting 508 eases of guns,‘92 cases of materials, 20 cases of bullets, and 6 gun- carria-es, which had been brought to Bombay by four Turkish officers for the Ameer of Kashgar. The Consul-General stated that he had received no official instructions from Constantinople regarding the disposal of the arms, &amp;c ; but the Commercial Agent of the Ameer of Kashgar at Bombay represented that they were intended as presents from the Sultan of Turkey to the Ameer of Kashgar, and that the men in charge had received orders to convey them as ±ar as Bombay, and having landed them there, to transfer them to the charge of the British Government, to be forwarded at its expense as far as the 1 unjab Frontier. Authority was thereupon conveyed for the issue of the necessary pass sanc tioning importation of the arms and ammunition into British India and their transmission to the Punjab Frontier for export to Yarkand. On 6th December the Bombay Government telegraphed to enquire whether the arms should be passed free of duty through the Custom House ; also whether they should be forwarded to Lahore as requested by the Punjab Gov ernment at the expense of the British Government, or whether the expenses should be borne by the importers. * i ^ i It was decided that the arms should be passed free of duty as provided by the rules framed under the Kashgar Treaty, and that the Ameer s Agents should make their own arrangements for transport.( 196 ) The Kashgar Agent then represented that the men who had come in charge of the presents were provided with funds by the darkish Government sufficient only for their expenses as far as Bombay, and that m the absence of orders from Kashgar he was unable to take the responsibility of dealing with them otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the Sultan as communi- cated to him He begged, therefore, either that the Government of India would take charge of the articles and forward them to their destination, or that instructions might he issued for their safe custody until the receipt of orders from Kashgar on the subject. Unless arrangements had been made for the tianspoit of the arms and ammunition to Lahore, the articles would have remained at Bombay for an indefinite period; and under these circumstances, as an act of courtesy to the Ameer, the Government of India authorized their transmission at the public expense from Bombay to Lahore, to be retained at the latter place pending the receipt of instructions from the Ameer of Kashgar. The Bombay Government was further instructed to treat the men in charge of the arms as guests of Government and defray their expenses to Lahore, which was accordingly done. On arrival at Lahore, Mahomed Murad Effendi, the officer in charge of the arms, &amp;c., having received no instructions from the Ameer regarding their disposal, proposed to send five of his followers to Yarkund to obtain His High ness’ orders, and applied for an advance of money for their travelling and road expenses; further requesting that allowances might be granted for the main tenance of himself and three followers, who, he proposed, should remain at Lahore. The Government of the Punjab was accordingly authorized to grant such sums on this account as might be considered reasonable. An advance of Bupees 300 tvas made to the men who started for Yarkund, while the expenses 0 n account of those who remained at Lahore amounted, up to 31st July 1876, to Rupees 1,149. In course of time the Secretary of State called for information regarding these proceedings (Secretary of State, No. 29, dated 22nd June 1876) which were duly explained. The Government of India added that their action had been dictated by a desire to show every reasonable courtesy to the Ameer of Kashgar. It would have been difficult to refuse to assist his Agent in arranging for the transport of articles intended for presentation to the Ameer by the Sultan of Turkey. The action of the Government of India was approved. The following letter w r ritten by Professor Vambery to the Daily Telegraph was copied into the Levant Herald dated 6th June 1877. It deals with the question of the Sultan’s present of arms and of the employment of Turkish Military Instructors in Kashgar :— “ It was in my last letter on the same subject that I alluded to the not very encouraging position in which Ameer Yakoob Khan finds himself, partly caused by the threatened continua tion of the struggle with the Chinese, and partly by growing discontent among his own subjects. Vv ith reference to the latter, I now draw attention to the secession of Kiamil Kban from the cause of the ruler of Kashgar—the same Kiamil Khan who is a brother of the Ambassador who recently arrived in London, and played so conspicuous a part in the founda tion of the new Muhammadan Empire in the East. We hear from Russian authority that this relative of the ruler of Kashgar was at one time a citizen of Tashkend, where he lived in the quarter known by the name of Iski Ordu. In 1865, after the capture of the city by the Russians, he went to East Turkestan, stayed some time with his adventurous cousin, and was during the last eight years Superintendent of the Kashgar Arsenal, as well as commander ot two regiments of Sarbazes (Europeanised Kashgar soldiers). Whilst in the arsenal he had the duection of 50 workmen in the gun manufactory, where the good Kashgarees endeavour to P - 1 - 6 a ™ ls similar to those sent by the Sultan of Constantinople to his soi-disant vassal in t e ian-Shan. We had heard something about these presents as well as of a certain number oi Osmanli military instructors who went out to East Turkestan together with the English % mission headed by Sir Douglas Forsyth, but detailed accounts reach us now for the first time, ccor ing o these, not only did the Sultan give, besides other matters, six guns in good order, but the Khedive of Egypt also sent two pieces, whilst the number of the Osmanli military instructors amounted to seven, one of whom Yusuf Effendi, is occupied in drilling the cavalry, two others the artillery, and a fourth, named Zeman Bey Effendi, a refugee from the Caucasus, able to speak and write Russian, remains with Yakoob Khan himself as interpreter or Secretary.olceti; e Ameer M tooltii f their h?e|. be graoWfoti 'oposei, sbla tinglyaioie asonabk iir bind, wit; .ed, up toil; for infmatii; !ndJunel8IS|f, rat tlieir aetii; totheAfflfflifi .gent in ariifE Ameer by It s approved cy to the Mj m Ittt; le employffl^' id to the it®! 5 ( 197 ) Another of the seven—one Mehemmed Effendi—made several attempts to procure rifles, but failed, and is now in Kashgar without any official engagement. Judging from the reports received, the ruler of Kashgar has not been very successful in his endeavour to establish a native manufactory of modern weapons of warfare. A certain Abdul Rashid of Kokand has produced a few primitive pieces, and the best workmen are those Indians engaged in Aksu. Thus military progress is exceedingly slow in East Turkestan. The number of regulars amounts scarcely to 4,000 men, under the command of an Indian formerly in the English service, and the whole force is stationed, according to Russian information, as follows : Yarkund, 1,000 men; Khotan, 300 men; Yangishahr, 400 men; Artush, 100 men; Ram and Sairam, 200 men; Kucha, 1,000 men; Karashahr, 400 men; Bugush and Kurla, 100 men; Toksun, 10,000 men; Turfan, 1,200 men; total 15,200 men. This intelligence is, in truth, derived from Kiamil Khan, who was received with open arms by the Russians in Tashkend, and in token of his gratitude revealed all the military and political secrets of his cousin’s deadly foes of the Muhammadans in Asia. “ In addition to these short and seemingly insignificant items of a news from East Turkestan, I intend to give you in my next letter a somewhat detailed account of the Panislamitic movement in Central Asia, as sketched in a private letter which reached me quite recently.” [ Secret, March 1876, Nos. 102-121.] [ Secret, September 1876, Nos. 100-118.] 120. Visit of Syud Yakoob Khan to India in the autumn of 1876 to arrange for the location of a permanent British Resident in Kashgar in accordance with Art. IV of the Yarkund Treaty. —In July 1876 the Punjab Government reported the arrival in Cashmere of an advance party said to belong to Syud Yakoob Khan Tura. The Government of India had heard nothing of the Syud’s coming, nor were they aware whether he intended to visit India. But they directed that an European officer should be sent to meet him, and that he should he treated as a guest of the British Government. Presently Mr. Shaw from Leh forwarded a letter addressed to him by the Syud. The latter wrote:— “ After my return from Turkey, via Russian territory, I, who am a well-wisher of the British Government and your friend, stayed with the Ameer of Yarkund at Aksu for two months. His Highness has given me full power to carry out the Treaty concluded between the British and Kashgar Governments. “ Having been invested with the full power concerning the embassies to the Porte and the British Government, I have arrived at Sanjuthis 30th day of Jamadi-ul-awal (23rd June 1876), with the intention of visiting Constantinople. I hope that I may personally consult you on the best mode of carrying out the terms of the Treaty. “ I will bring with me a copy of the Treaty, duly attested by the seal of His Highness. The Ameer is anxious to arrange for your stay in his territory. It is hoped that by the time I reach, you will arrange with your Government to start for this country. “ I will visit you wherever you may be on my arrival in India.” The Syud arrived at Srinagur on the 15th August where Captain Molloy had been deputed to meet him. In conversation with Captain Molloy, Major Henderson, and a Native correspondent, Syud Yakoob said that the Ameer ot Kastmar desired Mr. Shaw’s appointment to Yarkund as permanent British Resident; that he had brought down the Yarkund Treaty ratified by the Ameer; that no fresh treaty had been made with Russia subsequent to the one concluded in 1873; and that his own conversations with the Czar had impressed him with the belief that Kashgar had nothing to fear from Russia as long as the Ameer behaved w ell. Shortly afterwards the Ameei’’s letter to the Viceroy (Eord Lytton) was received. After the usual compliments, it notified the purpose ot the Syud s mission in the following terms:— “ For the purpose of congratulating you on your being appointed the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and for carrying out the conditions relating to the Treaty con cluded and confirmed between these two Governments, I have appointed Syud Jakoob Khan as my Vakil with powers, and instructed him to settle this good affair, which has up to( 198 ) this time been ^ ex^fineTveAau/by my Envoy the sa.d Synd Yakoob Khan. I hope that anything which he will say may be considered as coming from me. [Secret, December 1876, Nos. 81-118] 121 Conversations between tbe Envoy and the Foreign Secretarv Exchange of resident Envoys.— In due course the Syud arrived at Simla, and bad two official interviews with the Eoreign Secretary (on 30th September and 6th October). It has been explained that Mr. Shaw did not deliver to tbe Ameer the ratified copy of the Treaty which he had taken to Yarkund. He returned to India brinmng back this copy with him, but did not succeed in obtaining from tbe Ameeig duly ratified, the copy of the Treaty which had been left by Sir D Horsyth. Tbe Syud having brought down this copy made it over to the Foreign Secretary, and in return received through Captain Molloy tbe copy which Mr. Shaw had taken to, and brought back from, Yarkund. Upon this Treaty tbe following conversation took place. With regard to Article VI the Envoy said that a i ast y ear w h en he went down to Calcutta, Lord Northbrook had consulted him as to the advisability of Mr. Shaw’s remaining at Yarkund. “ With the view of ascertaining whether there would he any objection on the part of the Russians to Mr. Shaw’s remaining, the Envoy acting on the am quite_certaiii no sue i 0 f the Governor-General proceeded to Russia. Mean while the Governor-General wrote to Mr. Shaw to the effect that should the Ameer permit him to return to India, he was to return, and His Excellency also intimated to the Ameer that if His Highness desired Mr. Shaw to stay, he would stay, otherwise he would be quite ready to return. “The Envoy proceeded to Russia and ascertained that the Russians had no objection to Mr. Shaw’s remaining at Yarkund; they, however, remarked that the Envoy was the cause of the intimacy between Kashgar and England, and they asked him whether he had done so. He replied that he was at Constantinople when the friendship was inaugurated : the Russians then requested the Envoy to remain at St. Petersburg as the Agent of the Ameer to whose Court the Russians would also send an Agent. The Envoy, however, observed that he had only come to congratulate Russia on the marriage of the Grand Duchess Marie, and that he was not authorised to represent the Kashgar Government. “ From St. Petersburg the Envoy continued his journey to Chemkend, and there he met General von Kauffmann who made similar propositions to him, and to him he gave similar replies. The General then asked that 10 of his officers should be allowed to make yearly * V. 5 .— This is the first place of shooting excursions in the vicinity of Shahidulla,* where he importance in Kashgar territory on heard there were many musk-deer. The Envoy objected, that the borders of Cashmere. there were many savage people such as the Kunjooteesin those regions, and that the lives of Russian sportsmen would not be safe ; if General von Kauffmann would give assurance that in the event of any of the Russian party being killed, no questions would be asked, well and good. The General declined to give any such assurance : and the Envoy rejoined that in that case he could not undertake the responsibility, as his fair name was involved. N.B .—I advice was given. What we were in structed to say was that the Envoy might, of course, go to Russia or not as he pleased.—E. H. “On arriving at Kashgar the Envoy narrated all the above circumstances to the Ameer, and described to him the want of regulator (or regulation) of Government (be Zabtagi) and the state of the troops in Russian Turkestan. The Ameer then instructed the Envoy to proceed to India to carry out the provisions of the Treaty, namely, that a person from Kashgar should he appointed as the Ameer’s Agent in India, and that Mr. Shaw should go to Kashgar; further that the Envoy himself should be t o Ameer s Agent in India. The Envoy was also told to notice the menaces of war by which to sovereign was threatened from the side of China. On this subject he had to remark that t o Russians had previously offered to send a representative and negotiate peace between t e parties. The Ameer, on being informed of this offer by the Envoy, replied that he did no want a Russian Agent, hut that he wished for one of his old friends, the English, such as ir Douglas Forsyth, well acquainted with the manners and customs of the country. Such an arrangement, His Highness thought, would increase the renown of the English Government and promote the friendship and cordiality subsisting between the two countries.1 -l Sto , (* ■ 8 ] : eliY «toft si tarbni succeed k ^ hich lad copy made ij?

He feared his people would not be able to keep Kashgar for ever, and he would far rather see the country fall into the hands of the English than into the hands of the .Russians. The Envoy added that he had a family and relations in Kashgar, and quite appreciated the value of 'the English alliance. So confirmed was his devotion to us that if anything were done contrary to the provisions of the Treaty, he would side with us against his own Government.” To these remarks the Foreign Secretary replied as follows:— “ The Government of India highly appreciate the cordial expressions of friendship conveyed in the letter of His Highness the Ameer of Kashgar, and verbally repeated by Your Excellency, and on their part fully reciprocate the feeling which has dictated those expressions. “ The request, however, that the provisions of the Treaty of 1874 should be now carried out, that is to say, that an officer from Kashgar should be appointed as Agent of His Highness the Ameer in India, and that Mr. Shaw or some other officer of the British Government should proceed to Kashgar, is a matter demanding careful consideration. I am to remind Your Excellency that an officer was sent in 1874, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty, to Yarkund and Kashgar, and was empowered, should His Highness the Ameer so desire, to remain at Kashgar as the representative of the British Government ; but Mr. Shaw, after remaining for some period in Kashgar territory, received no intimation of the desire of His Highness that he should stay, and he accordingly returned to India ; and it now appears from the letter of His Highness and from Your Excellency’s statement that the delay and hesitation which took place were in consequence of His Highness having taken measures to ascertain whether there would be any objection on the part of the Russian Government to our representative remaining. u Under these circumstanees, it becomes necessary, before giving a definite reply to the proposal of His Highness the Ameer, to refer the matter for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government in England. “ Meanwhile the Viceroy trusts that you will remain in British India as His Excellency’s guest in such place as may be convenient to yourself, and he has already invited your presence on the occasion of the coming Assemblage to be held at Delhi for the purpose of proclaiming the assumption by Her Majesty the Queen of the title of f Empress of India.”’ [Secret, December 1876, Nos. 81-118.] 122. Conversations continued. The Syud’s landed pro perty in Cashmere. Negotiations with the Maharaja.— The Envoy also brought forward the question of his jagir in Cashmere with regard to which he explained :— a That his ancestors had possessed three villages in Cashmere since the days of Sayyid Ali of Hamadan to the time of the Sikh conquest or about 200 years. Last year when he was in Jammu he showed the Maharaja a document (produced) proving his title to the villages. The Maharaja replied that if the Governor-General expressed his written consent he would be happy to meet the Envoy’s wishes. The Envoy subsequently represented the matter to the Governor- General and a letter was sent from the Foreign Office at Calcutta. The Maharaja thereupon agreed to give half the value of the villages in land and half in cash. A Sanad (produced) was accordingly forwarded to the Envoy in Calcutta. The Envoy soon afterwards wrote to ask for the revenue of the current year, and Dewan Kirpa Ram sent him in Calcutta Rupees 11,000 promising to pay up the balance thereafter. “ When the Envoy returned to Cashmere on his present visit to India, he wrote to Dewan Kirpa Ram begging him to appoint some one to make over the land which is situated in the Ilaqua of Kamraj. The Dewan replied that be had a private communication to make on the subject. The Envoy then repaired to Jammn and had a private interview with Kirpa Ram, who informed him that there was no objection on the part of the Durbar to give the land, provided the English expressed a desire that this should be done. As the Envoy knew that Lord Northbrook had already written to give his consent, he was forced to conclude that the Cashmere people were playing some trick (shaitani, lit. devilry). When the Envoy enquired whether he should repeat Dewan Kirpa Ram’s words on arrival at Simla, the Dewan replied that he had made the above communication to the Envoy as a secret, and that he (the Envoy) was to say that the Maharaja was suspicious on account of Mr. Shaw’s return from Yarkund, and for that reason had discontinued the arrangements for the grant of the jagir. “ What the Envoy now wanted was that a written communication from the Foreign Secretaiy should be sent to Cashmere, to the effect that there was no ground for suspicion, and that the English Government would be glad to see the jagir granted. “ The Envoy added that in point of fact the Cashmere people viewed with, disfavor the intimacy between Kashgar and India. When he got back to Kashgar from Russia, residents of( 200 ) that city had spread a report that an English Army was being prepared to take the One of these persons was named Jafir, and the Envoy caused h.m to be imprisoned.” Upon this point the Foreign Secretary was instructed to mate the ing reply: country, follow- “With, regard to Your Excellency^ representation regarding the jagir ia Cashmere territory,! am to observe that the British Government intimated to His Highness fc Maharaia of Cashmere that, if His Highness should be disposed to accede to your request, so objection would be raised by His Excellency in Council. « The Governor-General in Council bad no intention to put pressure upon His Highness the Mabaraia to confer any such gift against his own free-will, and His Excellency in Council is not prepared to do so at the present time, but the Viceroy is about to proceed on a visit to His Highness the Maharaja at Jammu, and will make enquiry upon the subject, after which a fnrF.ViPrCommunication will be conveyed to you. “ The Envoy having intimated that he clearly understood what the Foreign Secretary had said, the interview was brought to a close/' The Maharaja of Cashmere expressed his readiness to re-grant the jagir upon receiving a written assurance that his act would be counted among the other services he had rendered to the British Government. Accordingly ia a khureeta from the Viceroy the Maharaja was told “ that the grant of the jagir to Syud Yakoob Khan, who is the Envoy of an ally of the Government, is much appreciated by me, and will he at all times regarded by the British Got- ernment as a most friendly act on Your Highness’ part.” (Khureeta dated 29th January 1877.) The Maharaja replied :— « Your Excellency^ kind letter has reached me, and has been the cause of honor and exultation to me. Through it I am informed that Major Henderson had communicated to Your Excellency my readiness, according to previous correspondence, to grant an annual sum of Rupees 21,000 of the Srinagar coinage in cash, together with certain land, to Syud Yakoob Khan Tora, the Envoy of the Ruler of Kashgar; and that Your Excellency has kindly appre ciated this grant to the Envoy of an ally of the British Government. I need not mention further that I gave my consent to the valuable grant to the above- named Syud only on the recommendation of the British Government, and in furtherance of my desire to serve it, and also on the consideration that the Syud is a well-wisher of the British Government. It is my predominant desire to possess the good opinion of the Gov ernment. When at Delhi I gave my promises to Major Henderson that this State would never, as it has never, fall short of performing those actions which would conduce to its holding the good will of the British Government. I beg to offer my thanks to Your Excellency for your kind approval of the grant, and I am sure that this act will be considered for ever by the Supreme Government as done by me with the expectation that I may enjoy the good-will of the Government. Nothing can pre dominate over the orders of Your Excellency/' The Viceroy replied (khureeta dated 28th May 1877) thanking the Maharaja for his friendly act in having re-granted this jagir to the Syud and acknowledg ing His Highness’ professions of good-will.

Reply of the Viceroy to the Ameer’s letter, and report of the proceedings to the Secretary of State.— A reply, dated 6th October, was then sent by the Viceroy to the Ameer’s letter cited in paragraph 120. The following is an extract:— I have received Your Highness' distinguished Envoy, and heard with pleasure the expressions of cordial friendship which he was charged to convey. I have entrusted to ,the Envoy a letter which Her Majesty the Queen of England has addressed to Your Highness in acknowledgment of Your Highness' letter of September 1874. The piesents by which Her Majesty's gracious letter was accompanied, together with a few gm s fiom myself, have been consigned to the Envoy for transmission to Your Highness: and I have invited um to be present as a guest of the British Government on the occasion of the Impena Assemblage which will be held at Delhi on the 1st January 1877 for the purpose of proclaim- of^/ndia 6 ChiefS ^ Pe ° Ple ° f Illdia the assum P tion hy Her Majesty of the title of Empress/4r2 ( 201 ) unto 1* H, a TOtb ir^i: mess to rg.^ ^ be coie|: ve roment, k bb&amp;t tbs guji' % offefc?

It shall have my earnest attention, and in the meanwhile I have intimated to Syud Yakoob Khan my hope that His Excellency will remain for the present in India as my guest.” The proceedings were also reported to the Secretary of State in the follow ing despatch No. 50, dated 19th October 1876:— With reference to the telegram to Your Lordshipk address of the 18th August 1876, we have the honor to forward, for the information of Her Majesty's Government, a copy of the correspondence noted in the accompanying Abstract of Contents, relative to the visit of Sayyid Yakoob Khan to India, and the proposals made by him on behalf of the Ameer of Kashgar that the provisions of tlie Treaty concluded with Kashgar in regard to the residence of a British officer at the Court of His Highness should be carried into effect. “ The Treaty in question was confirmed and ratified by Lord Northbrook on 13th April 1874, and as under Article XII it was necessary to arrange for an exchange of the ratified copies, Mr. It. B. Shaw was deputed to Kashgar for that purpose and to take up the office of British Representative at the Court of the Ameer. Accordingly Mr. Shaw proceeded to Yarkund in the autumn of 1874, and there he met Sayyid Yakoob Khan, who informed him that it was not the intention of the Ameer to give full effect to the Article providing for the location of a British officer in Kashgar pending the result of the Sayyid's approaching journey to Europe. “ As soon as these circumstances were made known to the Government of India, it was resolved that Mr. Shaw should not remain at the Court of the Ameer unless distinctly pressed by His Highness to remain. Orders to that effect were issued, and at length after much delay Mr. Shaw left the territories of the Ameer in July 1875 and returned to India. The Ameer, though apparently not unwilling that Mr. Shaw should remain, had intimated no distinct wish that he should do so. His Highness, moreover, gave no paper of ratification in return for the ratifica tion of His Excellency the Viceroy, nor were copies of the Treaty exchanged, for the reasons fully stated in Mr. Shaw's letter No. 74, dated 11th August 1875, which was transmitted to Your Lordship with our despatch No. 47, dated 14th October 1875. The letter brought by Mr. Shaw to Calcutta, and which that officer believed to be the paper of ratification, was nothing more than the usual complimentary communication from the Ameer to His Excellency the Viceroy. “ It is possible that the omission on the part of the Ameer to fulfil the formalities required by Article XII of the Treaty may have arisen from imperfect knowledge of what was required; but the facts now revealed by Sayyid Yakoob Khan indicate that the cause of the delay, hesita tion, and irregularity was a feeling of uncertainty in the Ameer's mind as to the view which the Russians might take of the intimacy between His Highness and the British Government. The letter from the Ameer to the Viceroy and the conversation recently held with His Highness' Agent show that the Ameer is now prepared to welcome a British Repre sentative at his Court. “We have now to decide whether it is worth while under the circumstances to depute Mr. Shaw to Kashgar and to recognize Syud Yakoob Khan as the Agent of the Ameer in India. On the one hand, the location of an experienced and intelligent officer at a convenient spot beyond our northern limits, from whence he could watch the course of passing events in Central Agfa, and exert the moral influence of the British Empire towards the maintenance of peace, would have manifest advantages. On the other hand, there is of course some risk involved in placino- an accredited officer in a position where it is difficult, if not impossible, for us to protect him, and where his safety and honor might be affected by the action of unforeseen circum stances. “We incline rather to the opinion that there may be advantages in the deputation of a British officer to reside at Yarkund more as a Commercial than a Political Agent; but m reference to Your Lordship's despatch No. 19, dated 24th July 1874, we think that tbe decision is one which should rest more with Her Majesty's Government than with ourselves. Should that decision be in the negative, we believe that the fact that the Ameer of Kashgar has thought fit, for political reasons, to suspend the operation of an important provision of a Treaty which His Highness had finally accepted and confirmed, furnishes us with ample grounds for stating that we also would prefer that the provision in question should not be carried into effect for the present. “We may add that Sayyid Yakoob Khan has brought with him the copy of the Treaty which remained in the possession of the Ameer, and he has asked that it may be exchanged for the copy which Mr. Shaw conveyed to Kashgar and brought back again. “We have deemed it desirable to invite him to the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi as the guest of the Government of India. He has accepted that invitation, and appears to entertain a strong desire to pay a visit to England in the course of the next spiing. [Secret, December 1876, Nos. 81-118.]( 202 ) 124. Reply of the Secretary of State sanctioning appoint, ment of a permanent Political Resident in Kashgar and accepting Syud Yakoob Khan as representative of the Ameer with the Government Of India- After a short interval the Secretary of State replied as follows (from Secretary of State, No. dl, dated 5th April 1877) to the despatch cited in the preceding paragraph. He said “ Her Majesty's Government learn from these papers that Sayyid Yakoob Khan has arrived in India with a proposal from the Ameer that effeet^shall now be given to Article VI of the Treaty concluded between His Highness and the Government of India in 1874, which provides for the appointment by that Government of a repiesentative at the Court of Kashgar and by the Ameer of a representative with the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. “ Your Excellency in Council, while recognizing that risk is involved in placing an accredited officer of Government in a position where his protection would be difficult, and where his safety and honor might be affected by the action of unforeseen circumstances, inclines to the opinion that there might be advantages in the deputation of a British officer to reside at Kashgar, more as a Commercial than a Political Agent; but you consider that in the event of Her Majesty's Government being opposed to such a measure, the previous conduct of the Ameer in .regard to Article VI of the Treaty would furnish a sufficient justification for a refusal to carry it into effect at present. a Her Majesty's Government are disposed t© regret that the relations between the Govern, ment of India and the Ameer of Kashgar should have been placed on a Treaty footing. Our commercial interests in the country are comparatively small, although they may be expected to increase; while, from a political point of view, the connection is not without embarrassment. At the same time the Treaty of 1874 having been concluded, and the insertion of Article VI providing for an interchange of representatives having been strongly pressed upon the Ameer, Her Majesty's Government are of opinion that a refusal now to accede to the earnestly expressed wish of His Highness that under that Article representatives may be appointed by both parties to the Treaty, is scarcely expedient. Such a refusal could hardly fail to prejudice the position of the Ameer towards both Russia and China, and might give rise to reflections upon the faith of the British Government, which, however liitle justified, would be prejudicial to our good name and interests, not only in Central Asia, but in the States bordering on British India, with which we either have, or may desire to contract, Treaty relations. “ Apart from this consideration there would probably be some positive advantage to the British Government from the presence at Kashgar of a judicious officer, who would be in a favorable position for acquiring trustworthy information as to the progress of events in the adjoining countries, and at the same time might by his influence be able to restrain the Ameer from ill-considered acts likely to embroil him with his neighbours, and to provoke attack which he would be powerless to resist effectually, and against which no assistance could be afforded to him. “ Her Majesty's Government have not overlooked the risk of personal danger to a European at Kashgar, under contingencies which might arise, or the possibility that the appointment of a British Agent at that place might be regarded with jealousy by Russia. They do not, however, consider that the objections to the measure based upon these grounds are sufficiently weighty to counterbalance the arguments in its favor. The position of a European officer in the midst of a Mahomedan population can never be altogether free from risk; and, in the case of Kashgar, it is undoubtedly true that the Ruler could only nominally be. held responsible for the safety of the officer accredited to his Court, and that redress for any injury or insult to him could not practically be enforced. But after careful consideration of what has been recorded on this point by Sir I). Forsyth and Mr. Shaw, who are, perhaps, the authorities most competent to give an opinion in regard to it, Her Majesty's Government think that, from the concurrence of testimony as to the friendly disposition both of the Ameer and the people generally, they are justified in regarding the danger to an English officer in Kashgar as not very serious. un tne whole, therefore, n . , - , - 11 Majesty s Government agree with Your Excelienc oum i in thinking that the friendly relations which have been established with the Ruki as )gar s ou be maintained; that Sayyid Yakoob Khan may remain in India as represe tive of the Ameer with. Your Excellency; and that a British Resident should be deputt Kashgar, m accordance with His Highness' request. The date of his deputation Her Maje ovunmen eave m the hands of Your Excellency, but they are disposed to think tb should be deferred t.ll towards the close of the ensuing travelling season; by that time posi ion o a ans may be such as to render the measure less open to misconstruction in va; q a tis an i migit e were its execution possible at the present moment, or, on the &lt; hand, ^circumstances may have occurred to make its abandonment clearly advisable. •ii Majesty s Government think that the communication which Your Excel] his PYnvpcJl! °, 1G ^ m r er inthnating your intention of acceding to the wish whk P i e presence of a British Representative at his capital, should be so wc3 sancti fent ’Mb a P h ' taEnnwtiV^ * a measured a sici ffl! ... relation^ placed on a I®;, althougli tkj y. tionisnotsili and tlie inscAs,' i strongly pr«l|j now to aiteittii presentativKijIu usal could hrljiii: &gt;, and miglitgl?{i i tie justified, wJ; ; in the States kfc Treaty relatioos, some positm «: idieious offiMr,ib( ,o the progress ds .ence be ableinn* iprhboiirs, and tor o 1 t ainst which is« ;he risk of irise, or the pc' regarded with j&amp;- .easure based op ; in its favor, If in never be at#' t the Ruler «ii f his Court, and Jut after careful e® 1 Mr, Shaw.^f; to it, Her lly disposition® ^ the danger to ^ with b )S!

Your eventual decision on this point must be influenced by the course of events and the reports which you may receive from the Resident, whom it might be convenient to charge with the delivery to the Ameer of the Queen s letter and presents which, pending a decision on the question which forms the subject of this despatch, appear to have been made over to Sayyid Yakoob Khan. 5 '’ 125. Visit of Syud Yakoob Khan to Europe, February 1877 • After the conclusion of the Imperial Assemblage the Svnd left Bombay for Europe on the 28th February, accompanied by Captain ^Molloy, and armed with letters of introduction to the Consul-General in Egypt and the British Minister at Constantinople. Captain Molloy was allowed a salary of Rupees 1,000 per mensem exclusive of travelling expenses, and as a special case and out of consideration to the Envoy personally the latter’s expenses were paid as far as Suez. At Constantinople the Syud remained for some days awaiting an interview with the Sultan. During his stay a member of the Russian Embassy called upon him and endeavoured to dissuade him from continuing his journey to England. The Envoy answered that the object of his visit was to obtain facilities from the British Government for the conclusion of a treaty with China. His visitor thereupon urged him to go to St. Petersburg, where he would he warmly received, and obtain every assist ance in the prosecution of his object. In reply to a telegram from the Secretary of State, the Government of India advised that the Yarkund Envoy should be treated in England as a guest of the British Government. There was no precedent for this course, but it was considered that its adoption would have a good effect. He left Constantinople for London on the 9th May. At a final interview with the Sultan the latter dwelt much upon the great importance of all the Mahomedan States of Asia uniting to prevent Russia from carrying out her ambitious designs against Turkey and Central Asia, and of looking to England as their only friend for help and advice. [Secret, February 1877, Nos. 1-7; January 1877, Nos. 83-90, 96-98, 137-138.] [Secret, August 1877, Nos. 99-101.] 126. The position of the Ameer of Kashgar with regard to the Chinese. Sir B. Robertson’s Report.— At this point it will he convenient to leave for a time the history of the British relations with Kashgar and of Syud Yakoob’s proceedings in England and to notice, as briefly as possible, the progress of the operations on the north-west frontier of China and the relations of that Government with Kashgar. In July 1875 Sir B. Robertson, British Consul at Canton, submitted a report to Lord Derby showing that the Chinese Government were con templating active measures on this frontier. He quoted a memorial from Tso-Tsung-Tang, dated October 1874, which asserted that after having secured their communications the Chinese troops had advanced to Gutchen (Kuchen) and Barkul, that a depdt had been established at Khamil (Kami), a garrison placed at Oroumtsi (Urumchi), and the co-operation of the Mongol Chiefs secured. The rapid advance which the Chinese forces had recently made, and the evident determination of the Chinese Government to recover lost ground, led Sir B. Robertson to predict an early collision with the troops of Ameer Yakooh Beg. He wrote— “ In the Service Reports I have had the honor to transmit, mention has, from time to time, been made of the assembling of a Chinese force on the north-west frontier. It is.only of late, however, that this movement has assumed much importance, at least sufficient to indicate what is now made apparent, an intention to re-assert the Imperial authority over such parts of the Province of Kansu, and the whole of Yarkund, which for several years past has been lost( 204 ) to the Empire. Public attention, too, has been called to the position of the latter, owing to tie recognition by the Indian Government of Yakoob Beg-, the Atahk-Ghazi, or Ameer a l Mominiu as he is variously called, who, taking advantage of the weakness o the Chinese Government on its frontiers, had overrun Yarkund and pait of Kansu, and established himself as Sovereign over these territories. It seems certain however, that now China has time to attend to her outlying dependencies, she is not inclined to submit to the encroachments of Yakoob Beg: and some information, which lately reached me indirectly, so fully supports that view, that I think it advisable to bring the matter to your notice. “Tso Tsung Tang, Viceroy of Kansu and Shenhsi, wrote the following note to the Vice, roy of the Two Kwang Board Impe (tne portion __ . . ,, —.. Secretary, Viceroy of Shenhsi and Kansu, an Othcei of the 1 nst Giade, Earl of Koclnngj to Yuan, Vice-President of the Board of Revenue : to Chin, Assistant Commander-in-Chief and General at Oroumtsi (or Urumchi); and to Ching, Commander of the White Chinese Bannermen. The Edict was received on the 8 rd May, and on the same day Imperial commands were issued appointing Tso Tsung Tang Imperial Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the army in the newly-acquired Chinese territory; appointing Chin Shun General at Oroumtsi, with orders to assist Tso in military matters. Ching Lien is appointed to the command of the White Chinese Bannermen; he will await General Chin ShuiPs arrival in Gutchen, where he will hand over charge of the troops, stores, &amp;c., to Chin Shun, and will then proceed to Peking to take up his post, and he will return to the Board his seal as Imperial Commissioner. “-'Military affairs in the newly-acquired territory are very urgent; troops must be massed with the greatest haste, and the country must be thoroughly cleared. Chin Shun has the command of his own troops, in addition to which the army, formerly under Ching Lien, will be at his disposal; it is considered he will have an adequate force. He will mass all his forces and lead them in person against the insurgents, whom he will attack whenever he has an opportunity. There must be no further delay in recovering all the towns under the jurisdiction of Oroumtsi nor neglect of any strategic opportunity; whenever an occasion occurs for advancing his men, he will consult with Tso as to the best way of taking advantage of it, A r uan Pao-heng has already been ordered to Peking on service, and Tso has been ordered to hand over the duties of Commissary-General of the West Tartary army to the Provincial Chancellor of Shenhsi. The Governor of Shenhsi will memorialize the Throne, and will write to the various provincial authorities to hurry the payment of the contingents in money neces sary. With regard to transports and to all the subsidiary military store (depots at Khamil and Barkul, &amp;c., Tso will appoint an officer to superintend them. Yuan Pao-heng will not start for the capital until everything of which he has charge has duly been handed over. “ f The command of the army beyond the barriers, the charge of the commissariat and transport, shall be entirely confided to Tso Tsung Tang. “ f Lanchow, the capital of Kansu, being very distant from the scene of operations, it will be the duty of Tso to provide for all contingencies, and to devise means of supplying the troops beyond the barriers with provisions in such a way that the communication shall never be inter rupted, and that there shall always be a constant supply of food for the men and forage for the cattle; he will take care that remissness of supplies shall never impede active operations. Tso has written that the army under Tsung Ching has retired to occupy Tung Kwan. VYe have ordered Chien Ting-ming to order that General to remove and occupy various places which may prove to be important. This edict is to be sent at the rate of 600 li a day. Res pect tnis. In obedience to the above the Grand Council write to Tso Tsung Tang.’ ^ r , ( Henr y Bawlinson’s ‘ England and Russia in the East/ it is stated that between 1 . ai * ( l 1^69 Yakoob Beg, an adventurer from Kokand, had raised himself to power on the rums of the old Chinese Dominion, which had, in the first instance, been shattered by the lungan rebellion. In 1868 he sent an Envoy to St. Petersburg; this Envoy was not recog- mzed by the Russian Foreign Office. In 1869 a Mission was sent to Calcutta, and Lord Mayo despatched Mr. (afterwards Sir Douglas) Forsyth to Yarkund to accompany it on its return. Mr. , owevei, did not then meet Yakoob Beg, as he was engaged in military operations in the East. In 1872 Yakoob Beg made a Treaty with Russia, and the latter in 1876 acknow ledged his sovereignty In 1873 Yakoob Beg sent an Embassy to Consfcantinopole, and the k- u tan granted him the title of Commander of the Faithful, formerly held by the Caliphs ot Bagdad. On the return of this Ambassador to Yarkund, he was in the autumn of the same yeai joined by Sir Douglas Forsyth, then a second time on a Mission to V acoob Beg, with whom m February 1874 he concluded a Treaty on behalf of England. Since then Mr. Shaw has been our Resident in Kashgar. Sir Henry Rawlinson states—‘ Our Envoys to Kashgar have mvaiiably counselled prudence and moderation.

If China, for instance, should recover from the military paralysis which for some years has stricken her extremities, she might possibly re-assert her claim to Kashgar/ “ The above sketch of the career of Yakoob Beg shows that he extended his authority over the territories of Yarkund, Karashahr, and part of that portion of Kansu beyond the Great Wall ol China, between 1865 and 1870. During these years, China was doubtless stricken in her extremities with military paralysis, from which she is now rapidly recovering. Yunnan has, as 1 have reported, been thoroughly recovered; the Mahommedan rebels,called the Panthays, have been conquered. The borders of Tonquin have been reduced to order, and China seems to have regained her old ascendancy in Annam. “ In the same way the Mahommedan rebellion in Shenhsi has been crushed, and the Imperial Government was able to turn its attention to Kansu; and as the north-west of Kansu is connected with the territory under Yakoob Beg, I venture to give a short resume ol the military proceedings of China in Kansu, as far as I have been enabled to glean them from documents indirectly obtained, from the latter half of 1876 to the present time. On the 19th July 1876 the Chinese recovered Tung Kwan, which was stated in the Memorial reporting its capture to be the key of Suchow, but which I cannot find marked either in Chinese or foreign charts. Further successes were obtained in the neighbourhood in August, and on the 16th of November 1876 Suchow itself was taken, after a series of battles lasting nine days, and after a desperate resistance, in which the besieged had been reduced to the utmost extremity from want of food. The Chinese signalized their victory by executing 1,582 of the Mahommedans, distributing 5,400 of the men, with their families, over different portions of the empire, and sending the wives and children of the executed prisoners as slaves to various garrisons. At this time, Lanchow, the capital of Kansu, was used as a depot for the besieging army. After the recovery of Suchow, some months were employed in consolidating the results of the victory and in subduing the neighbouring country. Every effort was made to collect camels and horses to carry the army beyond the Great Wall, and in April 1874 five regiments were sent by way of Chia-yu Pass to Barkul. In May 1874, Chin-Shun, the General who took Suhchow, was able to start for Nganhsi, and proposed to commence inaugurating military depots at Nganhsi and Yuh-mun. From May 1874 to the present time I have not been able to procure many documents directly referring to military movements in Kansu. A Memorial, dated Octo ber 1874, written by Tso Tsung-tang, about negotiating a foreign loan, mentions, incidentally, that the Mongol Princes had all been induced to submit to the Imperial Government [the value of the co-operation of the Mongols, who are bigoted Buddhists, against Turkomans, who are Mahomedans, must be very great]; that military depots had been established at Liangehow, Kanchow, Suchow, and Nganhsi; that the Imperial troops had advanced to Gutchen and Barkul, leaving ten camps in their rear ; the establishment of an army at Khamil, supported by a flying corps of nine regiments to protect the neighbourhood of Suchow and Yuh-mun and keep communications open; and the placing of a garrison at Oroumtsi. “In this Memorial Tso complained of want of both men and money, and that his position was insecure. He added, however, that, if he were allowed to raise 2,000,000 taels (660,000&lt;f.), he should feel no anxiety. This money he has now received, and the document quoted above, which appoints him Imperial Commissioner of the newly conquered territory (i.e., of Karashahr and part of Yarkund, &amp;c.), orders him to prosecute the recovery of the ground lost by China with vigour, as opportunity may arise. Besides these general instructions, there are the parti cular orders to advance his military depots to Oroumtsi, Khamil, and Barkul. “ I may here pause to refer to two rumours, the truth of which I am unable to ascertain; the first, that Turfan has been garrisoned by Chinese troops; the second, that the Chinese have sustained a defeat, May 1875, at a place called Tu Mote, which I am unable to find either on the Chinese or European maps in my possession. “ Mr. Shaw, our Resident in Yarkund, stated that he believes there is no danger of an im mediate attack from China. Yet the short space of time that elapsed since the English Envoy advised Yakoob Beg to withdraw his garrisons from Oroumtsi, and the occupation of that town by a Chinese garrison; the fact that China has within two years recover'd her au thority from Suchow to Oroumtsi, a distance of about 1,000 miles (whde from Oioumtsi to Yarkund itself is only 1,000 miles, to Bukur or Jugur, on the border of the territory of Yar kund, less than half that distance, while from Turfan to Chukhiu, in Harasbahr, which is now dependent on Yarkund, is only about 120 miles) ; the fact that she is now pushing her depots to Oroumtsi itself, shows, 1 think, that she is bent on recovering her lost sway in that pait of Central Asia, und will probably soon, if she has not already, come into collision with Yakoob BegY forces. “ I observe that' a question was asked in the House by Sir Charles Dilke, under date the 24th of May, whether any information had been received as to the Chinese attack on the dominions of the Ameer of Kashgar, to which Lord George Hamilton replied that Mr. Shaw, the officer on special duty there, had stated there appeared to be no imminent apprehension of a Chinese invasion, but it was reported certain Tungan Chiefs had sent to the Ameer, asking for assistance against the Chinese. Now, I think it highly probable that the Ameer would( 206 ) conceal the actual state o£ affairs from Mr. Shaw, but be must be perfectly aware of tb, ChTese movement, and the jeopardy which threatens him. It may be a matter of „ even years, but that retribution will overtake him sooner or later he must fee well assured of, as it did tbe Pautbays in Yunnan and the Mahommedans m the west, io the Chiuese a defeat or two is of no account; they fall back on their supports, and, when ready agan, adranu, aradually exhausting the resources of the enemy and wear mg him out ; and this is what threatens Yarkund, unless Russia gives her powerful veto, but this is not likely.

Mr. Shaw contradicts the rumour of a collision between Chinese and Kashgar troops.— In October 1875 Mr. Shaw wrote from Srinuggur that no collisions between tbe troops of the Ameer of Kashgar and the Chinese bad been heard of in bast lurkestan, From tbe'sources of information at bis disposal, be was conyineed that no such events could have occurred without bis bearing of them. Only a few troops bad been moved eastward from Kashgar, whereas a campaign carried into Chinese territory, as reported, would certainly have led to such movements, which could not possibly remain concealed. The reports he had already furnished tended to show that the likelihood of a speedy collision between the troops of China and Kashgar had diminished. According to these reports the advance of the Chinese had been delayed and even turned hack by fresh dis turbances in their own territory. It was possible that a rumour of this fresh rising of the mountain Mussulmans in the west of Kansu (Tunganis and Salaris) had reached Europe in the form of the reported successes of the Ameer of Kashgar’s army, also Mussulman. Certainly the reversal of the orders issued in tbe winter or spring for the despatch of troops from Kokand, Yarkund, and Kashgar to the eastward (after all preparations, even to the purchase of baggage animals, were almost completed) would show that some thing must have occurred to relieve the Ameer’s apprehensions regarding the safety of his eastern frontier. [Secret, March 1876, Nos. 97-101.] 128. Account from the “Turkestan Gazette” of the Chinese plans. Condition of the Chinese Army. —The following informa tion furnished by Monsieur Sosnofski and which appeared in the Turkestan Gazette dated llth-23rd January 1876 corroborated Sir B. Robertson’s opinion “ In the month of December Tso-Tsun-Tang intended to march the forces at Lanchow aad its vicinity on Urumchi, the Lanchow troops being better armed and drilled than the rest. The towns of Karashahr, Turfan, and Pichan (south of the Tian-Shan) are considered to belong to China, although the Chinese Government do not occupy them at present by military forces, lso-lsun -1 ang assured Monsieur Sosnofski that the inhabitants of these towns had senthini addresses in vvhiek they declare their loyalty to the Pekin Dynasty, despite of frequent instigating proclamations and emissaries from Urumchi and Kashgar, and that they are only awaiting decisive actions and the arrival of Chinese troops to give tangible proofs of their true feelings. Neither the above named towns nor Hand, Barknl, and Kuchen have a properly esta dished civil administration, which is to be reorganized after the taking of Urumchi. ^ The commotion in Khechu, which is a centre of enormous wealth, has been quelled without recourse to extreme measures. f Upon the whole/ Monsieur Sosnofski remarks, Gso- I sun-1 ang has so well managed affairs and so strongly grasped the Mussulmans that they are now repudiating their faith and their traditions, naturalize themselves as true Chinese, eat pork, fe. • ! V Tlt | ashgar, it is the firm intention of the Chinese Government to move all the forces into kast lurkestan, as soon as Zungaria shall be subdued. Since May 1875 the entire western frontier region of China, including Zungaria and even Last Turkestan (over which Yakoob Beg has been the undisputed sovereign for the D b t ten years) , has been put under the administration of Tso-Tsun-Tang, who is styled a A ieeroy o± these dominions. This appointment is of great political importance to Russia, since i)■] iimour ofj Octob| 1 fte troop (j' ^ ol in It? 1 was coDicjji ^tkm.

It is very probable indeed that before the end of the present year we may have to record a collision between the Chinese and Kashgarian forces on the eastern border tracts of Tian-Shan, if the Commander-in-Chief should really have marched on Urumchi in December last (1875) as he intended doing.” But notwithstanding the advances made and the earnestness of the Chinese authorities there is no doubt that their troops were in great straits for want of money and provisions. On this head the following information reached the Government of India :— “ A report from the Military Governor of Kami reached Pekin a short time ago, representing the distressed condition of the Chinese in the district which had been selected as a basis of operations against East Turkestan. The Governor has 5,000 men under his command, the cost of provisioning them amounting to 50,000 Lous, or Rupees 100,000 monthly. “ The necessary representations were made by the Governor, and orders were sent from Pekin to the Governors of Shan-Si and He Van to supply the above sum. They explained, however, that the Treasuries of their provinces were empty; the demands, therefore, of the Governor-General of Khan-Su and of the Governor of Hami remained unfulfilled. The de tachment of troops stationed at Hami is composed of many Solons and Dahars, who have traversed several thousand versts across the steppes, ard ai’e now in need of everything. The Treasury should have issued 14,000 Lous monthly to them, but for two years only 3,000 Lous have been so distributed. During last summer they received no pay at all. The pitiable con dition of these troops can be easily imagined, particularly as the price of gi'ain at Hami is remarkably high; according to the accounts of the unfortunate commander of the Komul garrison, his soldiers are reduced to beggary, and he is obliged to borrow money from his richer officers, and even from the Kalmuk Faisans for their maintenance. The Governor says that all this is hut as a drop in the ocean, and is not sufficient to keep the men from starving. He demands 200,000 Lous immediately, aivd states that in case of refusal his troops will to a eertaintv be beaten if attacked. In all probability Yacoob Beg is well acquainted with these lamentable details, and should he take advantage of them, a large State will spring into exist ence between Russia and China which will be equally hostile to both countries; it will receive support from India with the direct object of finally destroying the Celestial Empire, and will place as many difficulties as possible in the way of Russia.” [Turkestan Gazette, No. 2, dated \lth-13rd January 1876.] [Secret, February 1876, Nos. 2-5.] lazetteoli f-Ilie folfi appeared in k iirJJ.rw march ied am i-Sban) arec^: lematpr®^ aDtsoffef n Dyn4 f Kashgar, Jtfct igive nil, and , er the talar rmous ^ Ives as ^ [}overa» eDtt uadi#; 'sun-r d iml 129. Defensive measures adopted by the Ameer. Strength and distribution of his Forces . —The dilatory proceedings of the Chinese gave the Ameer time to make preparations. In the spring of 1876 he was said to have replaced the Tungani garrison, armed only with bows and matchlocks, in the border towns of Urumchi, Manas, Kuna Turfan, and others, by Kashgarian detachments. Acting on the advice of the foreign instructors employed in drilling the Kashgar army, more discrimination was shewn in the selection of recruits. According to letters from Prince Kuli Beg, the Ameer’s eldest son, to General Kolpakofski, the Ameer himself had taken up his quarters at Kurla east of Kuehar, and had made a careful inspection of all the chief towns en route. As to the troops at the Ameer’s disposal the following distribution roll appeared in the Turkestan Gazette for March 1877 :— Men. At Kashgar. —Sarbazes (infantry) and Cavalry about ... ... 4,000 Armed Taipus (500 Tungans and 500 Chinese) ... ... 1,000 The Taipus are named after their long muskets, each of which is handled by four men : two holding it on their shoulders, the third aiming, and the fourth firing. „ Aksu.—T otal strength of troops about ... ... ... 200 (and 2 guns) Fresh troops are being levied at Aksu.( 208 ) At Yarkund.—T otal strength of troops about ... 1,000 „ Khotan.—T otal ditto of ditto ... 300 „ Yangishahr.—T otal ditto of ditto 400 „ Maral Bashi.—T otal ditto of ditto ... 100 „ Uch Turfan.—T otal ditto of ditto 400 ,, Artush.—T otal ditto of ditto ... 100 „ Bhamo and Sairam— Total strength of troops about 200 „ Kuchar.—W as originally garrisoned by 1,000 men, 700 of whom have now been withdrawn by Yakoob Beg ... ... 300 „ Karashahr.—T otal strength of troops about 400 „ Bugush and Kurla.—T otal strength of troops about 100 „ Toksun.—T;&gt; tal ,, of „ about 10,000 (and 9 guns) „ Turfan.—T otal „ of „ about 1,200 Total 11 guns and 19,700 [Turkestan Gazette, No. 33, dated ZMh August [f&gt;th September) 1876.] The Journal de St. Petersbourg, which cited Captain Knrapatkin as its authority, gave a different account of the Ameer’s troops. According to this paper the Ameer’s garrison at Davanchi comprised 900 jiggits* armed with rapid firing weapons and two guns of which one was a breech-loader. The garrison of the town of Turfan, commanded by Hakim-Khan-Tura, was composed of 3,500 jiggits and 5,000 foot soldiers, together with 20 pieces of artillery of different types. At the fort of Toksan, commanded by Hak-Kuli-Beg, a son of the Ameer, there were 4,000 jiggits and 2,000 infantry with five breech-loading guns; these last however could be of little service as there was no ammunition for them. The Ameer himself occupied the town of Kurla with a detachment con sisting of 1,000 jiggits, 500 sarbazes, and three guns. If to these 16,000 men were added about 10,000 Tunganis assembled for the defence of Turfan (unreliable and badly armed though the latter were), the total of the force which Yakoob Beg was in a position to place in the field to oppose the Chinese was arrived at. The Journal de St. Petersbourg denied that the majority of the Ameer’s troops were armed with rapid firing weapons. Most had only matchlocks, flint and steel guns, and falconets; nearly 10,000 men were armed with percussion guns, English rifles, and guns o*f native manufacture; only 1,500 or 2,000 were armed with Sniders. But while Captain Kurapatkin was at Ivuila a train of five carts passed through the tow r n said to be loaded with “rapid firing arms,” which had been sent up to Yarkund from India the previous year.

Advance of the Chinese troops against Urumtsi, Manas and Turfan. Capture of Manas. —A Bussian caravan which had started from Semipalatinsk in the beginning of June 1876, under charge of Captain Peftsof, arrived at Guchen on the -j^th July. They found a Chinese Army Corps of 20,000 men located in and around the town which was presently reinforced by 1,300 Mahomedan cavalry from Barkul. An other corps of 22,000 was stationed at Chimsa, 23 miles from Guchen, on the road to Urumtsi aud Manas. The first corps was commanded by General Shautun-Ling aud the other by the Tso-Tsun-Tang. Captain Peftsof wrote as follows to the Bussian Invalide, his letter being dated ^-fth July, Guchen :— “On the 10th (22nd) of June, both these corps advanced simultaneously along the road to Manas, with the intention of separating- at a place called Zemi-ehuan-tse, (Diehuan ?) 100 miles beyond Guchen : General Shautun-Ling- turning off to the left to lay siege to Urumtsi, while the Tso-Tsun-Tang commanding the other corps, proceeding further in the direction first taken, was to invest Manas. A separate division of 10,000 men was advancing at the same time from Khamil along the road passing along the southern base of the Tian- Shan. This division was commanded by the Tidu (Chief of the Forces in the Province) Jan (commonly called Jan Lansin), and was directed against Turfan. “ Three distinct Chinese columns were thus advancing against the three main points, and the three Chinese Generals were determined, at all hazards, to take Urumtsi, Manas, and Turfan by the 23rd July (O.S.). “As regards the Tungans, they have 4,000 men at Urumtsi under the brave and energetic Beyan-Akhun, and 3,000 at Turfan and Manas, respectively. These towns are surrounded by stone walls, and are defended. A fortnight before the advance of the Chinese troops a mission was despatched by the Chinese to the Tungans, inviting the latter to surrender, and promising in such case a full amnesty and special rights according to the discretion of the Chinese Viceroy of the Province, the alternative being extermination. “ The Generals waited impatiently for the return of the mission, but it did not re-appear, whereupon the advance was commenced. Captain Peftsof was told, under pledge of secrecy, that if even the Tungans did surrender voluntarily, relying on the promises of the Chinese, the latter would not leave a single man alive, sparing only the women and children. (c After dwelling on the very imperfect state of the Chinese army in all its branches, Captain Peftsof observes that the rear of the active force is sufficiently well secured. ^ Most of the supplies came from Lanchovv through Ansichow, Khamil, and Barkul, to Guchen, which is the main depot. The corn supplied from Russia constitutes but a small (quantity of the provisions consumed by the Chinese troops. “ At each post along the above-named line of communication there are from 50 to 200 soldiers, and at eleven picket posts, where there is no fodder under foot, there are large supplies of dry forage. Not a day passes without several hundred camels coming into Guchen with various supplies. “Tso,* the Tsun-Tang, or Commander-in-Chief of the forces in, and Viceroy of, Western China is still at Khamil, and it is not known what town he will select for his residence, but it is certain that the army will remain two or three years in the province of Ili-Su, until it is perfectly pacified.” On the 24th August 1876 Sir T. Wade reported to Lord Derby that the JPekin Gazette of the I7tk August had contained a decree in acknowledgment of a report addressed to the Throne by General Kinshan, Commander-in- Chief of the army of the North-West, to the effect that on the 27th, 28th and 29th June a portion of his forces advanced up to the walls of the town of Manas, between Urumtsi and Kur-kara Usu (on the road from * According to intelligence quoted in the Journal de St. Petersburg, No. 238, 9th (21st) September, from the North China Herald, the Chinese army of 110,&lt;X)0 men bad been almost entirely destroyed by famine and by the enemy, and the Viceroy Tso had committed suicide.( 210 ) Barkul to Hi, in about longitude 87° 05'E„ and latitude 44 15 N ). S o ffle of the outworks of the insurgents had been taken and destroyed, and upward, of four hundred of the enemy slain. The loss of men on the Chinese side was not reported, but four subaltern officers were named as having been billed in action. , . Sir Thomas Wade, however, did not believe m any Chinese success. He rather thought that their troops had suffered some reverse and that Chiaese Officers having been killed an explanation was necessary. However on the 11th September the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg repeated the following telegram, dated 9 Septembers Tashkend which had just been published in the local press : * After eio'ht days’ fighting- the Chinese took Manas on the 4th August and occupied wfl, fmUrcss. Insurgent leader fled to Urumtsi ; troops ordered to take position in the north fortress. w Twill Vmvfi to march According to the Chinese account which appeared in the Pekin Gazette of the 3rd October 1876, Hwangtien was taken on the 10th August, Kiemuti (or Tsi-Nwai-Ch’eng) on the 16th, and Urumtsi on the 17th. The result of these victories was to leave the Chinese with no enemy between their ova forces and those of Yakoob Beg on the south side of the Tian Shan. But on I have been unable to neeoneile these eonflieting the north side Manas Still remained in tta statements as to the date of the capture of Manas. hands Ol the lUUgamS. On tile ZllQ September the Chinese army arrived near Manas and immediately commenced active operations. The town was obstinately defended, and it was not until after two months’ hard fighting that it eventually succumbed on the 6th November. With the capture of Manas the campaign of the Peh Lu (i.e., the region north of the Tian Shan range) came to a close. It left the Chinese in a position to contemplate a victorious advance into the Nan-Lu (i.e., the region south of the Tian Shan range) extending from Turfan westwards and embracing the whole of Kashgaria. Mr. Mayers observed :— “ The possession of Manas and Urumtsi, independently of the loss inflicted on the Tungani Mahomedans, is undoubtedly a great advantage to the Chinese forces, as it enables them to push forward their advance at pleasure either towards Turfan on the south, or in the direction of Hi and Chuguchak (Tarbogotai) on the north and west.” In December 1876 Lord A. Loftus reported a conversation with M. de Giers, in which the latter mentioned the capture of Manas and Urumtsi by the Chinese, and the massacre of the whole population. Yakoob Beg was said to he in some alarm, for some of his troops had assisted the Tunganis against the Chinese and shared their defeat. The Ameer, however, had not applied to the Russian Governor-General of Turkestan for assistance or protection. The Turkestan Gazette, No. 1, dated 5-17th January 1877, contaiuedthe following paragraph on the subject: — “ The Kashgar Envoy, who is now in Tashkend, says that the military operations of the Chinese have been put a stop to with the approach of the winter season. The Tso-Tsun-Tang confined himself to an occupation of Urumtsi (without a blow) and of Manas, which was taken by force, and in which a great number of the defenders perished. It is said that the Chinese put to death more than 1,500 Tungans in Manas, without distinction of age or sex. The heads of the decapitated were exposed on the city walls. Satisfied with their achievements, the Chinese are in no haste to cross the Thian-Shan and pass into the dominions of Yakoob Beg. The first town from that quarter is Turfan, and this according to Murad Beg, the Kashgar Envoy, is an impregnable fortress, having been strongly fortified by Yakoob Beg. “ The latter is still in the vicinity of Turfan with his army, being resolved to resist the Chinese energetically. The conflict with the Chinese cannot, however, occur before the spimg or summer of 1877, and it is doubtful whether the Chinese will be as successful agains well organised forces of Kashgar as they have been against the unarmed Tungani masses. a- .ce rurn oured that in the eastern districts of Jitysbahr many of the p eo p|® disaffected to Yakoob Beg, and have passed over to Hakim Khan Tura (son of Buzruk Khan). It is reported that Hakim Khan has entered into relations with the Chinese, who are, of course, highly delighted to find so unexpected and valuable an ally.

Chinese Embassy to Kashgar in spring of 1877.— Ac cording to the Turkestan Gazette the Chinese Governor sent a Mission to Kashgar in the spring of the current year to open negotiations with Yakoob Beg. The Mission included two officials w r ith a suite of four Tungans and eight Chinamen. These, having arrived at Taksan, delivered a letter from the Tso-Tsun-Tang, addressed to Yakoob, and informed him that he (Tso-Tsun-Tang) had received a packet from the Bogdo Khan, which would not be handed over to Yakoob Beg, unless the latter agreed to bind himself in writing that he was ready to act up to the tenor thereof before knowing its contents. This Yakoob Beg refused to do. In the letter from the Tso-Tsun-Tang, Yakoob was informed that the Emperor (of China) had ordered a cessation of arms between China and Jityshahr, and the re-opening of trade, provided that Yakoob would cede Turfan to China. To this proposal the Badaulet replied that he, too, was anxious to establish commercial relations with China, .and to conclude a commercial treaty to that end; but that he was not prepared to cede Turfan, since he had not taken that town from China. The Chinese, he added, may keep, and ought to be satisfied with, the towns already taken from me, viz., Manas, Urumtsi, Sanji, Kutubi, and others; but should they resolve to take Turfan by force of arms, they will find me prepared te defend it. Einally, Yakoob Beg retained at Taksan one of the officials and twm Chinamen of the suite, permitting the rest of the mission to return to China.

Employment by the Chinese of European auxiliaries in the war against the Ameer of Kashgar.— It appears that in the beginning of February 1877 a representation was made by Tso-Tsun-Tang in regard to the impending advance against Turfan, and thence into the territory now occupied by the Ameer of Kashgar. He lamented the heavy expenditure which the war entailed, and proposed to bring matters rapidly to an issue by employing European mercenaries as had been done in the Taeping rebellion. He hoped by this means to bring the campaign to an end in a year. Mr. Mayers wrote:— “The project broached by Tso may have arisen in one of three ways. Tso was Governor of Chekkiang in 1861-63, and in this capacity employed the services of many Europeans, such as Ward, D’Aiguebelle, Cooke, and others, in his operations against the rebels. He has at this moment at least two foreigners, said to be English artillerymen, in his service; and the idea of having recourse to a European contingent may be of his own conceiving. On the other hand, it may possibly have been suggested to him by M. Giguel, who has kept up a sort of correspondence with Tso since the latteEs departure from Foochow, where he founded the arsenal on M. GigueFs plans in 1866; or else be due to Russian advice. It is well known that since the passage of Colonel Sosnofskis’ expedition through Kansu in 1875, Russian assistance has been lent to Tso in the shape of supplies for his army operating against the Tungani Mahomedans in Zungavia; and now that Manas has been taken, the army in that quarter is in full communication with the Russians at Hi (Kulja).” A debate took place in the Grand Council on this proposal, of which Mr. Mayers gave the following account:— “ The difficulties in which the Imperial Commissioner Tso finds himself placed being .strongly urged on the notice of the Government, it was the opinion of the Grand Secretary Pao, seconded by the Grand Secretary Shen, that the campaign should be continued with the# ( 212 ) foreign assistance, on the model of Colonel Gordon’s Contingent in 1863-64 which solicited by Tso himself. Pao Chung-tang was of opinion that auxiliaries might be obtej from Corea, the daring valour of the Corean sold.ery being the ground upon which hebj his recommendation, and that, failing this, European mercenaries might be enlisted. Tt« Prince of Kung, on the other hand, was in favor of a conclusion of hostilities witbouta definite recognition of the Ameer or any kind of treaty arrangement, in fact a termination'of 'the existing state of affaire. King Lien the newly-appointed Member of 4 , Council, supported the Princess view, and probably with all the more, earnestness from his local knowledge gained during his long tenure of office as Commander-in-Chief on the north-west frontier. The fifth Member of the Council, Li Hung-tsao, gave no opinion either way. p ao and Shen opposed all idea of amicable arrangement with the Ameer as undignified; anditwas upon this point that a disagreement arose between Pao and the Prince which led to the former seeking retirement in the temporary duties of Chief Lxaminei. “ This remark refers to the following piece of intelligence dating from some days pr e . viously ‘ It is stated that a disagreement has occurred in the Grand Council between the Prince of Kung and King Lien on the one hand, and the Senior Grand Secretary, Pao T UI1) on the other, with reference to the question of the campaign against Kashgaria; and it is a significant fact that the Grand Secretary Pao has within the last few days been gazetted Examiner-in-Chief for the examinations now in progress, an unusual appointment for a Minis- ter of his exceptionally high position. It places him in seclusion for a fortnight or more.” [Progs., Secret, Mag 1877, Nos. 26-28; Secret, October 1877, No. 197.] 133. Further account of the Chinese operations in Kash gar. Occupation Of Turfan.— In April 1877 Mr. Fraser, of the British Legation at Pekin, reported a rumour that the Chinese Government had received news of a discouraging character from Tso-Tsun-Tang. The information was not very definite, but it pointed to the conclusion that military operations on the north-west were not progressing satisfactorily. About the same time Lord A. Loftus furnished the following abstract showing the latest information (24th March) in the Russian newspapers from North-Western China:— “ The Turlcistan Gazette states, according to reports of native traders coming from Manas, that the Tso-Tsun-Tang had reached Sandji with 12,000 troops, and that 5,000 men had been left at Manas. Sutunbun, the Chinese Commander-in-Chief, was at Urumchi with 20,000 men. The distance from Sandji to Urumchi is 100 versts, and to Manas 110 versts. “ The son of Yakoob Beg had recently been stationed at Davanclii, which is SO versts distant from Urumchi. “Latterly, however, Yakoob Beg ordered his son to retire from Davanchi with its inhabitants to Turfan and to demolish the fort of Davanchi. There are at present 5,000 Kashgarian troops at Turfan. The distance between Turfan and Davanchi is 125 versts. “Takoob Beg^s troops are stationed at Tukhtasan Settlement (five versts from Turfan), where 40 entrenchments have been thrown up. Suntunbun sent some of his men on three occasions to lurfan for the purpose, it is supposed, of negotiating with the Kashgarians: these men were, however, detained by the latter. Sixty Kashgarians had fled from Turfan to Urumchi and taken service under Suntunbun. No collision had by last accounts occurred between the Kasbgarian and Chinese troops. The Chinese have erected a fortification at Takianza, which will soon be occupied by three battalions. fi 1Gie are no soldiers at Jinkho, but 100 armed Tungans have been despatched to Shikbo. “ These are so-called Pekin Tungans, who are the faithful allies of the Chinese, and to whom the capture of Manas is mainly attributable. “ Early m January about 130 armed Chinese and Tungans reached Kulja in small parties, with the ostensible object of purchasing various stores. Their conduct having excited ie suspicions o t e Russian authorities, they were disarmed and escorted to the Chinese trontier, where their arms were returned to them.” On the 28th June Mr. Fraser telegraphed the publication in the Gazette of a decree notifying the capture of Turfan by the Chinese. This report was corroborated by a telegram from Tashkend, dated 24th June, which stated that Colonel Prejevalski writing on the 16th May had informed GeneralI ! 1 enaries “elusion fML.

Again, on the 13th October Mr. Fraser reported that the Chinese forces on the Kashgar frontier were believed to have met with a very serious repulse about a month back. Their position was described as critical, and it would be very difficult to send reinforcements in time to be of any use. [Proceedings, October 1877, Nos. 185-239.] 134. Sir D. Forsyth’s visit to Pekin and interview with the Grand Secretary. First Suggestions for mediation between the Chinese Gpvernment and the Ameer. —In the spring of 1876 Sir D. Forsyth visited China, and an interview was arranged between him and the Grand Secretary Li. Thereupon, Sir T. Wade furnished Sir D. Forsyth with certain instructions. With regard to Kashgaria, he said that the Govern ment of India had consulted him, and that his opinion had been in favour of commercial but against political relations with the Ameer Yakoob. From a letter written by Mr. Aitchison, dated 6th July 1870, he had understood that Lord Mayo concurred in this view. He was therefore somewhat astonished at a later date to receive from the Government of India a copy of a formal Treaty in which, as it seemed to him, the sovereignty of Yakoob was fully recognized. However, the Chinese had never reminded Sir Thomas lYade of the conversation which had prompted his letter to Lord Mayo, alluded to by Mr. Aitchison, and he had of course avoided all further allusion whatever to the relations of the British Government, actual or possible, with the Ameer. After the settlement of the Japanese affair in 1874, Sir T. Wade had recommended the Chinese Government definitively to abandon Zungaria and Kashgaria; the first had been annexed by China in 1758, and was now more or less occupied by Russia; the second had been annexed in 1765, and was now ruled over by Yakoob Khan. Both annexations were protested against by Chinese Statesmen of the day. The Grand Secretary Li, though inclined to ascribe this advice to Russo- phobia rather than to friendliness to China, did nevertheless admit that it would be wiser not to prosecute the present expensive war. But Tso-Tsun- tang, the high officer carrying it on, was, he said, pledged in honor to finish it, and he himself, although if he had audience of the Emperor, he would venture to propose what I had suggested, would not venture so to commit himself in a written memorial. A few weeks later the Emperor died, and last year Li had memorialised the throne upon Kashgar affairs, thereby exposing himself to angry denunci ation as an unpatriotic' Chinese. There was beyond doubt a section of Chinese who advocated the recovery of the lost provinces, possibly on patriotic grounds, and possibly because the conduct of this expensive war enabled those concerned in it to make their fortunes. One thing was certain, namely, that the pro vincial subsidies on which Tso-Tsun-Tang had to rely were some £9,000,000 in arrears; that there was an annual deficiency in the pay of his troops of some £5,000,000; and that he was at the same time obliged to pay, within three months of delivery, hard cash for certain war supplies which he received from the Russians, inevitably by a most circuitous route. ********( 214 ) If Li should commence with Kashgar affairs, it would he well for §j r Douglas Forsyth to suggest the conciliation of Yahoob by the Chinese Govern, ment, and that the good offices of Her Majesty s Government would be valuable to this end. An argument likely to tell with the opponents of such a policy would be that which had apparently been advanced by the Khan himself; to wit that he is not the enemy of China ; that he has never been a rebel against the’Chinese Government, never having been its subject, but having been carried to his present position after their authority had been overthrown by rebels, the disorder occasioned by whom he had repressed. It would be well for Sir DouHas to state, that from his knowledge of the man, it would be vain to think of turning him out, but that it would not be impossible to arrive at some modus vivendi by which the dignity of the Empire might be so far guaranteed as to render unnecessary its perseverance m a war which, even if successful, must last many years, and could only be sustained at an enormous annual onri rUo r»rm firm an no of which misht at any moment be taken advantage of by a third party. In Sir T. Wade’s opinion the duration of a Mahomedan kingdom founded as Kasho-ar had been founded and situated between Russia and China was not likely kTbe considerable. If China was going to re-assert herself at all, her progress m the next two generations would be such that, should the territory in question, say twenty or thirty years hence, fall into disorder again, she would be competent with no great effort to resume it. Should it continue well gov erned, on the other hand, it might be more convenient for China to have a Mahomedan ally in Kashgaria, who would certainly not contemplate encroach- ment on China Proper, than the advanced part of a western power, on whose quiescence she could less securely reckon. Probably these latter arguments wmuld provoke the suspicion, if not the remark, that Russophobia was making the British Government anxious. It might be well to anticipate this by the observation that the British Govern- ment does keep its eyes upon every movement of Russia in Central Asia, but that this does not make it less the policy of the Chinese Government to save the money it now wastes, not in Kashgaria, but in campaigns that are to enable it to approach that country. Lastly, Sir T. Wade’s great object, speak ing locally, would be best served by the addition, if Sir Douglas Forsyth felt free to make it, that it is England alone that can influence Yakoob Khan in aa influential sense, but that, Russophobia or not, she would not attempt so to influence him until the Yunnan affair were satisfactorily settled. This of neces sity took precedence of every other question between England and China. Having been instructed in the foregoing sense, Sir D. Forsyth proceeded to his interview with Li. A considerable portion of his report dealt with the Yunnan affair which lies beyond the scope of this precis. The following extract takes up so much of the conversation as related to the affairs of Kashgar and Central Asia:— “ He then changed the subject to Kashgar, and asked how long I stayed there, and whether I was well treated. On my expressing my great regard for Yakoob Khan, he said—‘ Will you write a letter to him from me ?’ I asked what the purport would be, and he replied —‘ Tell him to submit to the Chinese Government/ On what terms ? At one time he said unconditional surrender, and then on similar conditions to the King of Corea. I pointed out that until Yunnan affairs were settled satisfactorily, any serious discussion about Kashgar could not be entertained, but anyhow, I remarked, Yakoob Khan ought not to be looked upon as a rebel, for he had not foug t directly with the Chinese, but had rather overcome the men who had rebelled against China* His remark was that it mattered little whether he was a rebel or enemy ; he must be chastiser, after which the Chinese Government might perhaps recognise him as a subordinate Governor. He spoke of his subjection as a very easy matter of speedy accomplishment, on which remarked that such being the case, and as I knew that Yakoob Khan would not submit to o treated as an ordinary rebel, it would be useless my writing to him. I asked what the plans ot the General Tso were with regard to Hi as well as Kashgar, and he replied that first ot al Ourumtsi would be taken, and then Hi, after which Yakoob Khan would be attacked, jokingly said that if he would arrange not to attack Yakoob Khan till after they had recovered ,, \ wo ^ d : then endeavour to induce Yakoob Khan to submit. ‘ Will you guarantee that, n as e ’ ^ ^ ie h sa H that speaking of course merely as an individual and not on behalt olGovernment, I should be very glad to avail myself of the friendship which exists between Yakoob Khan and myself to place the matter before him in a light best conducive to his interests, but I could give no hope of his ever agreeing to terms of vassalage. I knew the man’s character, and was sure that what he had won by the sword, and as he himself says, by God’s will, that he will defend by the sword so long as God gives him life. I said he was a brave, wise ruler, who kept his country in admirable order, and I thought it was a great pity that his administration should be destroyed, and the country ruined by China for a mere senti ment. “ After making some enquiries regarding his resources and the state of trade, and remarking on the advance of Russia towards the Indian frontier, he asked if we were not afraid of Russia, and had we not entered into some negotiations to keep her off ? He also said— f I tell you as a friend I know that Russia has designs on India.’ I remarked that if Russia is so determined to advance as she is represented to be, it was not likely that she would allow China to recover Kashgar, and therefore all the money now being spent would be only for Russia’s profit. There was a good deal of talk on this subject, and he went off into long conversations with Mr. Mayers on the rights and wrongs of China. At last he said he really agreed to my view about Kashgar, and had already advocated them and would do so again, but he hoped that I would at once communicate with Yakoob Khan, and get him to submit. I of course pointed out that till the Yunnan affair is satisfactorily settled I could do nothing. But as a matter of enquiry, I asked how negotiations were to be carried on. For instance, would an Envoy sent from Yakoob Khan to Pekin be properly received, and would his life be spared ? Yes, he said, but as the entire management of the business is delegated to the General on the frontier, just as all Indian affairs are delegated by the Queen to the Viceroy, it would be advisable for Yakoob Khan to send his Envoy to General Tso to treat for terms. I somewhat demurred to this, saying that not improbable Tso would play with the Envoy till he got Yakoob Khan in his power, and then would destroy him and his kingdom, or at all events not adhere to the terms he might have offered. Li-Hung-Chang was rather great on the respect paid to Envoys and flags of truce, on which I said— ( I had heard all about this from my brother-in-law, Parks,’ which remark caused him a little reflection, and then he attempted to palliate that act of treachery. I then said that I could not advise Yakoob Khan to place himself at the mercy of a Chinese General, far away from the gaze of European nations, who like to see fair play, and the result of our further conversa tion was an expression of Li’s opinion that if the authorities at Pekin could be worked upon to entertain the idea of a compromise, it might easily be arranged for an officer of our Government in whom Yakoob would have confidence, to be present at Ourumtsi, or wherever the negotiations might be held, and then he thought some arrangement might be arrived at, by which Yakoob Khan might keep his territory without submitting to actual vassalage. Li-Hung-Chang pressed me to prolong my stay in Tientsin, but I did not consider this advisable, as it might cause him to attach an offical character to my purely private position. I therefore excused myself from remaining, and pointed out that I could in no way say what course our Govern ment would take, and anyhow I felt sure that we should not interpose our officers to the extent of counselling Yakoob Khan to accept the position of vassal to China. But if the Yunnan affair were satisfactorily settled, and my personal relations with Yakoob Khan could be turned to good account, so as to bring about a solution of the present difficulty, I should be happy to do all in my power. He quite understood this, and spoke hopelessly of some arrangements being arrived at by which Yakocb Khan might be maintained in his present position. I spoke on this subject with some confidence, because, as I think I mentioned at Pekin, Yakoob Khan had frequently alluded to his possible collision with China, and asked me whether he should send an Embassy to Pekin or not. My advice then was for him to abstain from giving the Chinese cause of offence, which they would assuredly take if he held Ourumtsi and Manas. When Syud Yakoob came to Calcutta last year, he begged as a favour that if I heard anything authentic about China really attempting to reconquer Kashgaria, I would let him know, and that if I ever went to Pekin I would advocate the Ameer’s cause. I think therefore that if I could show the Ameer, or his nephew, Syud Yakoob, that the Chinese are bent on recovering the country, and are able to carry out their intentions, and there is a way of escape without sacrificing his independence, he would listen to reason, and if so, not only would the Chinese Government be spared an enormous expenditure, but we should have in Kashgaria, for a time at least, and so long as Yakoob Khan lives and has capable successors, a far better administration than we are likely to see in Chinese hands.” Sir T. Wade thus summed up the results of the interview :— “ From His Excellency’s anxiety to see Sir D. Forsyth, I hoped that the interview might lead to something that might prove useful to us here in China Proper, or to the Government of India in its relations with Kashgaria. Nothing has come of it, at least nothing favorable. It will be remembered that, as soon as the Japanese affair was over in the. winter of 1874, I sent Mr. Mayers to urge the Grand Secretary to recommend recognition of the Ameer Yakoob as an independent sovereign. I have since reported the unpopularity that His Excellency had earned at Court by a suggestion to that effect ; and later still, the inability of the Chinese Government to find money for the payment of its debt to the army engaged against( 216 ) Kasha-aria, or for the prosecution of the campaign. Its pride persists in the war notwithstanding. Rumours have been current of the extreme embarrassment, discomfit^ even of the death of Tso-Tsun-tang, the high officer engaged, but the last requires eonarmal tion His death would not impossibly be followed by a break up of the force. I beg to enclose the papers referred to in my despatch above quoted. F Rpnrp.t. January 1877, Nos. 113-121.] 135. Negotiations for the cessation of hostilities between China and Kashgar and for the recognition of the Ameer by China— In May 1877 the British Embassy at Pekin submitted to the Govern- ment of India a memorandum of a conversation between Sir B. Bobertson, Consul at Canton, and the Chinese Viceroy. The latter said that China had reco vered all the territory she wanted in the north-west direction and was now disposed to treat with the Ameer on the most liberal terms. She would not even ask that he should pay tribute, only that China should exercise a legiti mate influence in Kashgar, though less than she exercised in Annam. He then made some general observations regarding the identity of interests between China and England as against Russia, whose rapid advance eastwards struck him with amazement. The following is the text of Sir B. Robertson’s report:— “ In a conversation I lately had with the Viceroy, I found His Excellency inclined to be very communicative on the subject (i.e., Chinese position in the north-west.) “ He stated that China had recovered all the territory she wanted in the north-west direction, and was now disposed to treat with the Ameer of Yarkund on most liberal terms, She would not even ask that he should pay tribute, only that China should exercise a legiti- mate influence in that part of the world, somewhat like, though less than she exercises in Annam. He stated that England and China's interests in the East were identical, and that the more powerful China grew the better it was for England : both had a common enemy to dread, and that was Russia, and which by its very constitution must be aggressive. His Excellency then drew a rough sketch of Russia's advance eastward since 1861, showing how that country had taken Hi, part of Sagalien (Hei-lung-kiang), and of Kiria. He remarked that the war between Russia and Turkey was inevitable; that the Ameer of Yarkund must take part with his co-religionists; that any understanding existing between him and Russia must be illusory; that personally as a Kokandi he would have a debt of revenge to pay Russia for her conquests in Kokand; that were he personally favourable to Russia, his peculiar position, ruling by popularity and not by hereditary right, would force him to rely more and more on the Sublime Porte and China than on Russia; and that his acceptance of the title of Ameer-el Moumenem from the Sultan, which must have been offensive to Russia, proved thus. His Excellency proceeded to state that if ever Russia took India, the days of China as a nation would be numbered ; that Russia must either strike for India or for China, as the holding of her recent conquests, poor sterile count'-ies, was exhausting her resources, and she could only recoup herself by occupying more fertile regions. His Excellency stated that China was not so anxious to recover Hi as to hold all she had left of Sagalien, and gain back the rest; that Chinese looked on Sagalien as Englishmen looked on India; and that the loss of part of it was a national disaster that all regretted. Reverting to Yarkund, he proceeded to say that some Chinese statesmen had been disposed to come to an arrangement with Russia to divide Aarkund between China and Russia, but that idea was not going to be carried out. The Chinese Government having determined that it was better to have a neutral State between their possessions so as not to be responsible for the action of savages on the border. His Excellency observed, whether correctly or not, I do not know that the advance of Russia struck him with amazement, as at the time of Genghiz Khan (Yuanch'ao Tai tsu) she was but such a petty State that the conqueror imposed on her as a sovereign his nephew, and that the Emperor of Russia was his lineal descendant. f His Excellency finally spoke in the highest terms of the Emperor of Russia, who, he said, would no doubt be glad to repress the aggressive spirit of his Generals, but could not, and that when territory had once been annexed, its restoration was impossible, as such would cause a general revolt all along the line of Russia’s territory. Whatever might happen, it was to be deploied that Russia seemed precluded from doing what it really was her interest to do, wz., consolidate her power. China could fortunately follow the wiser course. She no longer dreamed of reconquering Yarkund or Annam. “ 1 . made but £ew observations, as I did not wish to check His Excellency's confidential communications. I simply stated that how China had intimidated the Mahomedans by aIt» 121 .] )se rapid ali text of Airl and His Ei*- i the nortli.it$tj ' she waoteJiil; f YarliindoiB; China shonli © though less tat 3 East were it itution must lee astward since la g), and of lia: the Ameer of Ita ■ between him sit jtof revenge top; e to Russia,lisp ’ce him to rely is eeptanceoftiefe sive to Riw, f the days of 0» iaorforChii,^ t resources, ffll £ ; Jllencystate(lta l '' &gt;n, and gain 1«^ and that fc rkund, he no’ement wilt Sfc 4 going toi* 9 ®' ivea neutral^ ? reigu his MfW the W\\ ■ his Genew| hnpossihM ateverffl’S really^ 5 * e wiser« ( 217 ) display of her power, it would be well to conciliate them by leniency, and that an entente cordiale Detween the Court at Pekin and Yakoob Beg would, I imagined, tend to please Mahomedans throughout China.” The Government of India forwarded this memorandum to the Secretary un( ^ er C0Yer of the following despatch (No. 21, dated 16th July rhe report derives special interest from the growing feeling which appears to exist amongst the ruling classes in China, that the time has now arrived for virtually recognising the independence of Kashgar, and arranging terms of peace with the Ameer on a basis favor able to the interest of that Province. Though only a year ago the Chinese authorities were straining eveiy neive to accomplish the entire re-conquest of Kashgaria, it now appears that there is a disposition to forego even the demand of tribute from the Ameer, or the assumption of any more definite authority over his dominions than the Chinese Government affects to possess at present over such countries as Nipal and Burmah. If the views expiessed to Sir B. Robertson by the Canton Governor in regard to Kasngana aie in any way a reflection of those held by the Chinese Government^ we are of opinion that they are very favorable to British interests in the East; and we trust that the presence of the Yarkund Envoy in England may afford an opportunity to Her Majesty's Government for encouraging the alliance with Yarkuud apparently contemplated by the Chinese Government. J “ Your Lordship will observe, from the papers now transmitted, that the Chinese Govern ment appears less anxious to recover the Province of Hi than the territory of Sagalien, which must he held to include not only the Island of that name, but the entire region known to the Chinese as Hei-lung-Kiang or the Amur country, consisting of a wide tract on both sides of the river, annexed in great part by the Russian Government, through the efforts of General Ignatieff, then Russian Minister at Pekin, during the war of 1860 between England and China. “ We venture to draw the attention of Her Majesty’s Government to the views expressed by the Chinese Governor on the general subject of Russian aggression in the East. His observations, although put forward from a purely Chinese point of view, are interesting and important, as corroborating the general feeling on this subject which pervades the whole of the independent States on our northern and north-western frontiers.” [Secret, October 1877, 185-239.] 136. Proceedings of the Home Government in regard to these negotiations. —The suggestion in the above despatch to take advan tage of Syud Yacoob Khan’s presence in London to encourage the idea of an arrangement between Kashgar and China had been anticipated. From papers forwarded with a despatch dated 2nd August 1877 it appeared that correspondence had already passed between the India and Foreign Offices regarding Kashgar affairs. On the 4th June the Yarkund Envoy, Synd Yakoob Khan Tura, had an interview with Lord Salisbury, at which he avowed that one of the principal objects of his journey to England was to obtain by the mediation of Her Majesty’s Government a cessation of the existing hostilities between Kashgar and China. Lord Salisbury observed that such a proposal was rather for the considera tion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs than of the Secretary of State for India, hut that he doubted whether Her Majesty’s Government would feel in a position to move in the matter, unless previously assured that their action would be favourably received by the Government of China. He would, however, consult with Lord Derby on the subject. Ultimately, it appeared to Lord Salisbury that the establishment of friendly relations between China and Kashgar was much to be desired, and that there was no reason why, with that object, the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government should not be given, if desired by both parties. He therefore advised early steps being taken to ascertain, either by direct reference to Pekin, or through the Chinese Minister in this country, the views of the Chinese Government on the matter. ck His i itimi^( 218 ) Sir ThomasWade (then in London) to whom the question was referred advised as follows:— “From a recent conversation with the Minister Kuo I know that he is willing to meet Yakoob Khan informally to converse with him about Kashgnria or anything else, and to rep,,, the conversation. But as he would certainly not venture to report to the throne that he had entertained this proposal or that of h,s own inspiration he will have to shield himselib,, reference to us as promoting the arrangement reported If Yakoob Khan were to show great readiness on the part of himself or his master to make peace the Chinese Govemm,,, might too probably insist on terms too humiliating for acceptance. If we again show g rffl t eagerness about the cessation of hostilities, this will he ascribed as the Grand Secretary Li h* ascribed it, to our suspicion of Russia, and an inference of the kind would be against thi success of the negotiation. “ I think that both men should be educated before they meet as to what is to pass between them; that they should then be brought together with as little publicity as ^possible; that, any terms that we think well of arranged, the Khan should start at once for Kashgaria; that Kuo Ta-ien should report to his Government representing that we approve of what the Khan has proposed to him; that Mr. hraser be mstiucted to affiim our .approval at the lateen in conference, or through the Chinese Secretary, but committing nothing to writing. “ If a n Envoy from Kashgar appear in Pekin before everything is settled, the Legations of Russia, Germany and France will be immediately on the qni vive, and the Yamen will be bewildered into doing nothing whatever. The same result may be expected if we are known to be mediating. Peace once assured Russia may give China trouble. The common frontier is 3,000 miles long. There are always frontier grievances in reserve. She will probably press for what Colonel Boguslofski came in 1872 to require; cession of the Hi valley, which she has long possessed and will never restore. In that case China should he recommended to cede it.” However, before the proposed meeting could be arranged the Chinese Envoy called on Sir Thomas Wade (22nd June) and discussed Kashgar affairs for two hours. He declared that he had no instructions and did not know the wishes of his own Government, hut that believing an adjustment with Kashgar to he in the interests of China, he would recommend his own Government to accept any means to that end which Her Majesty’s Government might approve. He could not make a first move, and saw no advantage in a conference. What he wanted was that the Yarkund Envoy should state in writing something to the following effect: — (1.) That Yakooh Ameer would sign a Treaty with China, engaging,!!he were constituted ruler, under China, of Kashgaria, to make war on China no more, hut, on the contrary, to assist her in the maintenance of peace. (2.) That the Ameer should cede certain towns now held in his name— which they were Kuo-ta-jen did not seem very able to state; he had no clear knowledge of the geography of the country. (3.) That the Ameer should assist China to reconquer the country overrun by the Tungans or Nomads, north of the Tian-Shan, or Celestial Mountains, divide Zangaria, or East Turkestan from Kashgaria. Sir T. Wade’s remarks upon this conversation are worth extracting— I undertook that the conversation should be reported to Your Lordship; that I should request Sir Douglas Forsyth, without mentioning Kuo-ta-jen*s name to sound the Syud, and that if the latter were found willing to draw up a memorandum of such conditions as those above enumerated lor submission to the Ameer, it should be shown to Kuo-ta-jcn and hid before Your Lordship. I would then request Your Lordship, if you approved the paper,h communicate it to Kuo-ta-jen, with a recommendation that the Chinese Government should accept its terms. It is very difficult to say what is the immediate cause of the Chinese Ministers eager ness. . He evidently thought that the recent allusion to establishment of an Agent or rep&gt; e ' sentative m Kashgaria more or less compromised his responsibility. But his note to lour Lor ship on the subject would clear him of this before his own Government. Two of his remarks indicated a suspicion of the intentions of Russia—first, upon the language of some off journals, which proclaim that the people in the far west, the people now under Yakoob andt eirstart at once iat w e apptelr- ® ^r appro^j 8 Mthiogto^ ! 1 7 t% is setlti pi Wj n||ji M y ^ expecttiij, iaatroie, Ig i reserve.

Kuo-ta-jen, in the present interview, was alone with myself and Mr. Hillier, and he spoke with more than usual frankness, and, when he referred to Russia, with more than usual emphasis. He did not, of course, commit his Government in a question of which, as he observes justly, his mission to England does not bring it within his functions to treat; but I incline strongly to believe that he would not have gone as far as he did yesterday, unless he had received instructions to effect some settlement that would relieve China of the war with out loss of dignity. The selection of Kuo-ta-jen as Minister in England is due, it should be remembered, in chief part, to the Grand Secretary, Li Hung Chang, who is really the War Minister of China, and whose opinion, although he is not a member of the Central Govern ment, is more potential, especially in such a question as this, than that of any other member of the Government. The Grand Secretary I believe to be bent on termination of the campaign in the north-west. “ On the other part, from what Sir Douglas Forsyth has told me of the Syud Yakoob’s conversations with him, his master, the Ameer, is in such apprehension of danger from the Russians that he will accept any position that China may assign him—anything short of expro priation. Now, in the suggestion that the Ameer should enter into treaty relations with China, Kuo-ta-jen concedes far more than the Ameer could have expected. Kuo-ta-jen, it is true, professes to speak without authority, but it must not be forgotten that he has seen the note addressed to me shortly after I left Pekin by the Prince of Kung, as an answer to my queries in the direction of an accommodation. The Prince had written to consult Tso Tsan-Tung, High Commissioner of War in the north-west, and that high officer had gone no further than to declare himself ready to receive a representation from the Ameer, if it was couched in respectful language. Kuo-ta-jen is, for a Chinese, impulsive, or at all events less used than most of his countrymen to disguise his impulses. Still, I feel convinced that he is not speaking without inspiration. “ There may be many causes for this apparently new policy. The High Commissioners, Tso's, campaign is ruinously expensive. He himself is said not to desire its suspension, as his reputation is at stake, if he be not corruptly interested in its continuance. He is stated to be one of the ablest Chinese in the Empire, and this in high places will make him more enemies than friends. The Grand Secretary Li, amongst others, is said to be jealous of him. But the movementsxof Russia, not only in Central Asia, but in Europe, may be for something in the matter. The doubts created by the long postponement of my explanations of my late proceed ings in regard to the Yunnan case may also play their part. Kuo-ta-jen asked Mr. Hillier, on the 20 th, when the decision of Her Majesty's Government would become known. But he said not’ning on this head to me. He talked with considerable earnestness for two hours about the Kashgarian question, and of nothing else.” Sir Douglas Porsyth, who had intervened in the matter at Lord Salisbury’s request, considered that the terms proposed would be generally acceptable to the Ameer, who might be induced to send an Envoy to Pekin to conclude a Treaty. After some further correspondence between the India and Foreign Offices the following note was addressed by Lord Derby with the concurrence of Lord Salisbury to the Chinese Envoy :— “ Her Majesty’s Government have seen with regret the war which has for some time been carried on between China and Kashgaria, and have desired to take advantage of any oppor tunity which might present itself of using their good offices to endeavour to bring about an honorable and lasting settlement of the differences which have unhappily given rise to it. “ Such an opportunity has been afforded by the visit to this country of an Envoy from the Ameer of Kashgar, and Her Majesty's Government have, in the interests of peace, taken occasion by unofficial communications to ascertain whether a basis could be found on which terms of peace could be agreed upon. “ They have ascertained by this means that the Envoy would be prepared to submit to the Ameer proposals for peace on the following conditions, in which it is stated he has every reason to believe the Ameer would readily concur:— “1. A recognition by Ameer Yakoob Khan of the suzerainty of China [somewhat to the same extent as it is recognized by the King of Burmah]. The Ameer would be left in complete control over the country he now holds, but would [] Omitted at Lord Salisbury s suggestion. periodically send embassies, bearing presents or tribute to Pekin, and would address His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of China as his superior. “ 2 .

Wade has reported that you had in unofficial conversation mentioned to him as likely to be acceptable at Pekin that hopes may well he entertained that an understanding may with little difficulty be arrived at in regard to them. “ Under these circumstances they feel justified in recommending them for adoption, and in suo-o-estino- that you should communicate this expression of opinion to your Government, and enquire whether they are prepared to agree m principle to a settlement m the terms pro. posed. On learning from you that you are willing to commumcate with your Government i« this sense I will send instructions to Her Majesty s Charge d Aftaires to make a similar communication at Pekin, and to support the proposals so far as he can properly do so. “I have to add that Her Majesty’s Government are informed that should your Govern ment be ready to accept these terms in principle, the Ameer of Kashgar, on this being intimated to him, would at once send an Envoy to China to negotiate for a treaty of peace.” The Chinese Envoy sent two replies to this communication. In the first lie protested against Sir Thomas Wade’s supposition that he, the Chinese Envoy, had, even in unofficial conversation, spoken of the acceptability of the terms proposed to the Pekin Government. Sir Thomas W 7 ade had often spoken regarding the Kashgar question, but that if the idea of a settlement originated with the British Government, the latter ought to be responsible for it, and the Ameer ought to be required to surrender all the important cities which he had taken. Upon this basis he would represent the matter to his Government, but could by no means predict its consent to a settlement. At any rate he could not think of privately settling such a question, which depended entirely upon the wishes and views of the Pekin Government. In the second letter he discussed the terms of the proposed settlement and said :— “The western dominions of the Chinese Empire are divided into eight cities lying to the east and west of these dominions, each of these cities has jurisdiction over other cities and military posts, the total number of which reaches several thousands, not including those situ ated to the east of Turfan. Yakoob Khan, the self-styled Ameer, availed himself of the time when China’s hands were full to occupy these cities, and China cannot but endeavour to regain them. In my former despatch I spoke of this in detail, and 1 have now received Your Lord- ship’s opinion as to the manner in which a settlement might be effected. In reference to Your Lordship’s propositions, I think it necessary to make my representations still more clear, The wording of the first condition is very plain. “ That the Ameer should be left in complete control of the country which he now holds—is language to which I must protest. “The eastern and western portions of the western dominion of China are some four or five thousand Li (1 li=^ English miles) in extent. “ The four eastern cities join to the North Urumchi and to the south Tibet. These four cities are in fact the gates of China. I understand (one of them) Ku-Che (Kucha) lies very near to Urumchi and (another) Ho-tien is adjacent to Tibet. Should a line of demarcation be made at these cities, it would be of no importance to the Ameer, but if China regain them, then her communications with the western territories can be maintained. The Ameer must therefore give them back before a settlement can be talked of. e YV ith regard to the definitive demarcation spoken of in the second condition it remains with the Commander of the Chinese forces, Grand Secretary of State 7'so, to consider tie circumstances, and make treaty^ with the Ameer accordingly, regarding as the first andmos important step towards such a treaty the settlement of &amp; line of demarcation. The Ameer availing himself of disturbances in China, took possession of a territory of several tbousan i in extent. Such possession was unlawful, and he must consent to deliver up those p aces ulu ar u, real conse( l ueilce to China, when, having done so, the Grand Secretary of btate will be able to deal with the matter. This is unquestionably the right principle of action- With regard to the rendering of mutual assistance set forth in the third conditio 11 ) 1 must make the following remarks : “ Firstly. Li the regions lying to the north and south of Tian Shan, there have been disturbances for over ten years, and certain portions were occupied by the Ameer. In ° tb a so, ure weie ocal disturbances, and in these the insurgents were generally Mahome ans.1 °* opmioiW, t0 a seWematr lr ge d’AffaiJ,' &lt; &amp; «6Sl)| forme d that stflijj, tni eer of '^otiatefora^ mniiiQicati, \ thst he, ic f| the acceptal; Q as Wade kl § ea of a settlet he respoasifr aportantcifer; natter to his fe iement, At is hicli depealdi divided into e|lts as jurisdicti(M!t thousands, not We A meer, availed fe hina cannot ktef and 1 havero** night be effect^ - i my represeitafei- the country*^ mmon [tothesontlft!;; a) Ku-Cbe(h ; Should a bneot”^ ^ but it i mtainei of State 1 if in •etary gly, re^' gl be line -S' 6 ”! b MM“r. “ As the Ameer is willing to submit and to lay down arms and to agree to a definitive line of demarcation, the Mahomedan insurgents of the northern regions ought to be similarly pacified, in order to put an end to the war. “ These insurgents, rebelling under the Ameer’s name, the Ameer must be forced to dis perse them, so that at one and the same time peace may be restored and further disturbances prevented. “ Secondly .—As the submission of the Ameer depends upon the guaranteeing represent ation of Her Majesty’s Government, China would risk on her part to reciprocate the good feeling, in order to the establishment of lasting and mutual peace. Sir T. Wade last year whilst in Pekin frequently spoke on this subject, but the Chinese Government were averse to his proposals. How can I, therefore, rest assured that the Government would now listen to them? Nevertheless it is my sincere desire that Her Majesty’s Government should take the responsibility that the Ameer would not again cherish rebellious designs, so that the frontier of China might hereafter enjoy tranquillity, and be without fear of molestation. According to my views negotiations for peace might perhaps he entered into, and a stop put to the war, if by such a course an assurance of responsibility from the British Government should he obtained. “ Thus the third proposed condition should be divided into two. “ As I am not thoroughly acquainted with the condition in which matters stand outside the barrier, and have not brought with me records from China to which to refer, I am obliged to make use of the general knowledge which I possess, and to speak in detail of those circum stances only with which I am conversant. I cannot but reciprocate Your Lordship’s kindness, receive Your Lordship’s opinions, and in return give expression to mine. I beg Your Lordship to take these into consideration, and favour me with an answer, so that I may report to the Chinese Government thereon. It will remain however with the Chinese Government to deter mine whether these shall be acted upon or not.” In reply, Lord Derby disclaimed any intention of imputing responsibility for the acceptance of the proposals to the Chinese Envoy which was a matter to he dealt with by the Imperial Government at Pekin. The British Embassy at Pekin would be instructed to lay the matter before the Imperial Government and to use their best endeavours to propose a settlement, but the British Govern ment could not undertake to include any guarantee such as had been suggested by the Envoy. The following is a draft of the instructions to be sent to Pekin as approved by Lord Salisbury :—- “ I transmit herewith copies of a correspondence with Kno-ta-jen, respecting proposals for pence between China and Kashgar, and 1 have to instruct you to ascertain from the Tsungli Yamen, and report, with as little delay as possible, whether the Chinese Government is prepared to aoree on principle to a settlement on the basis of the terms pioposed, and would be willing to receive an envoy from the Ameer empowered to carry on negotiations. . Her Majesty’s Government desire you to use your best endeavours to effect an amicable adjustment of the differences at present existing between the two countries, but you must be careful to avoid pledging Her Majesty’s Government to anything beyond friendly advice. “ Her Majesty’s Government leave to your discretion to determine whether you may deem it advisable to make any reference to a mutual suspension of hostilities pending negotiations.” On the 23rd September Mr. Eraser, . Charge d’Affaires at Pekin, tele graphed as follows in reply to these instructions .■ * a With reference to your despatch, No. 90 of the 3rd August, Prince Kung insists that negotiations for peace with Kashgar must be carried on through Tso, Imperial Commissioner in the North-West, who will be instructed immediately from the throne and not through the Central Government in Pekin. The three conditions recommended as a basis by lour Lord- ship will be communicated to him. The Chinese insist strongly on their right to conquest over the territory of Kashgar. I shall hear further from them and then telegraph again to Your Lordship.” Subsequently in a despatch dated 24th September Mr. Eraser gave the following accounts of his interview with Prince Kung on the 23rd August “I found His Imperial Highness anxious to impress me with an idea of the victorious progress of the Chinese military operations in the north-west ; of the absolute nature of the claim of China to the territory of Kashgar; of her determmation to uphold .t; of the pro- bability of her being able soon to make it good by fresh conquest; and of the tact that the Minister Kuo had ho authority to treat in the matter, nor any fresh and accurate knowledge of the situation to guide him in doing so. The Prince told me further that all power, whether of action ao-ainst the Ameer of Kashgar, or of negotiation with him had been confided to Tso-Tsun-Tang, and must be left in his bands. Tins I was prepared to hear since so Lich had already been said to Sir Thomas Wade. I reminded His Imperial Highness that( 222 ) iquered by the Chinese only a century ago, and the country had ban ailed inau unun tuu xucuviaj ~ ~ 11 , i • me, I thought it best to say that I hoped he would not suppose any capital interest of Great Britain to be in question. The re-establishment of peace in the north-west was a matteroffar more importance to China than it could be to England; and one at least, of Kuo-Ta-jen^ proposals bad been found inadmissible by Your Lordship, that the engagement entered into between the conflicting parties should be guaranteed by Her Majesty s Government. To this His Imperial Highness replied that, whilst he fully recognized the good feeling that had actuated Her Majesty's Government, he still perfectly understood the nature of the British interest in the question; and there were other powers that need not be named whose interests China must also consider in regulating affairs in the north-west. The Piinees answer to the question conveyed in Your Lordship s despatch,. No. 9(J, is in effect this: Tso-Tsun-Tan^ and not the Central Government, must be negotiated . with. The Pimce himself, and the Ministers of the Tsungli Yamen, will in the meantime refer to the throne by_memorial the proposals received through Ivtio-la-jen and myself. I hen with the Imperial permission these proposals will be transmitted to Tso, the tenor of whose, reply will be communicated both to the Chinese Minister in London and to this Legation. With reference to His Imperial Highness' concluding suggestion, that it may be necessary to consider the interests of another power, I think there can be no question but that the interests foremost in the minds of the Chinese Ministers will he those of China, and that they will act purely and simply as they may deem best for themselves. “ They will be guided, without doubt, by the results of their military operations, and the probabilities of unconditional conquest. “ It is perhaps hardly worth while to attempt to conjecture whether there is any actual founda- tion for their present assertions of success. The attitude maintained at Pekin would be the same under all circumstances, and the rulers of Kashgar will themselves be the best judges whether Tso-Tsun-Tang's terms at any given moment are likely to be those of a conqueror or those of an adversary who may be treated with at advantage. “ I am told that Tso maintains a perfect understanding with the Russian authorities near the frontier, and even that this understanding extends, so far at least as the Kashgar question in concerned, to the Tsungli Yamen and the Russian Legation in Pekin. I cannot well estimate the probability of sufficient material aid being offered to Tso by the Russians to tempt his ambition to proceed with the task of conquering Kashgar at all hazards. If this should he possible, the determination of the Chinese Government to refer everything to him may perhaps be justly regretted, but in any other event, the Chinese can, I think, be trusted to distinguish their own proper interests from those of others.. There is nothing of ingenuous ness in their character. Themselves a crafty, ungenerous people, they have a keen apprecia tion of interested motives. If, as the Prince of Kung has said, they understand the nature of the concern of England for the pacification and independence of Kashgar, they are equally likely to understand that their northern neighbours have views of their own in the matter beyond the mere thwarting of English policy in Central Asia, and with acuteuessto recognize their own interests, they have certainly enough egotism to pursue them, and a suffi ciently robust self-esteem to think lightly of the favor or disfavor of even Russia, where those interests may seem to them to be the least in question.' [Secret, October 1877, Nos. 185-239.] 137. Reported capture of Karashahr by the Chinese Forces. In the Ladak diary, dated 17th September, Mr. Jenkyns reported intelligence received from a merchant named Alum Jan (dated 5th August), to the effect that the Chinese army had arrived at Karashahr, where a strong force ot lunganis had been sent by Hakim Khan Tura to oppose them. The following is the Kussian account of the capture of Karashahr taken from the Turkestan Gazette dated llth-23rd October: Monsieur Golofkin telegraphs from Sergiopol: “ After a battle with the Tungans which lasted for five davs, the Chinese forces under the command ot Ambans Lin and Jan have, on the 6th-18th September, occupied Karashahr and Kor e (Kurla), from which places they do not intend to advance beyond the town of Kucha during the present year, since further operations are rendered impossible by want of provisions ana means of transport.

From the middle of June to the end of August (N.S.) the Chinese did not stir from Turf an, Toksnn, and Davanchi, where their battalions have been decimated by the heat, and which at last compelled them to withdraw a portion of the garrison from Turfan to Urumchi, as previously announced. “ A Kashgar Sart coming from Turfan, who reached Kulja on the 16th-28th September, has given the following account of the latest events :— “The Mussulman inhabitants of Turfan voluntarily surrendered the town without a blow to the Chinese, notwithstanding which the latter bereft them of their wives, children, money, provisions—in short, of everything they possessed, after which the men themselves were carried off into slavery. About twenty days ago [presumably on the 8 th September N.S.] a Chinese army of some 50,000 men left Turfan in the direction of Karashahr, within 40 miles of which they were attacked and completely defeated by a force of about 18,000 Tungans, whereupon the fugitive remnants of the Chinese army returned to Turfan A* On the 4th December Mr. Fraser telegraphed from Pekin that in the Gazette of that day a decree had been published notifying the capture of Karashahr on the 7th October and of Knchar (Kucha) on the ISthidem. The following is the text of the decree :— “ Tso-Tsun-Tang has memorialized us reporting that the army advancing for the recovery of Kashgaria (Sin Kiang Nan Su), has re-occupied successively the cities of Karashahr and Kucha. In the seventh Moon (August last ) 1 Lin Kin-fang, Taotai of the Su-uing intendancy in Kansu, advanced at the head of all the forces under his command from Turfan, marching westwards. The leader of the Muhommadan (Tungani) insurgents, Bayen Hn, abandoning Karashahr, fell back across the K^ai-tu river, all the Turlsi, (turbaned) Mahomedans on the west bank of which were compelled by him to join 1dm in his retreat. On the 1st day of the ninth Moon (October 7th), our army entered the city of Karashahr, and on the 9th October the town of Kurla was re-occupied. Upon this Bayen Hu again retreated westward by way of Yung Sur, but being vigorously pursued by Lin-kin-Fang at the head of the advanced guard for a distance of several hundred li, the insurgents were come up with at the Muhommadan village of Tu Kaoffh, where they offered battle. Our troops attacked them boldly, and in successive encounters inflicted a loss in killed upon the rebels of some 1,500 men. On the 18th October Kucha was taken, and numberless other fortified towns and villages of the Muhommadans were recovered. The number of Muhommadans who have been delivered from the authority imposed upon them by the insurgents amounts to some hundred thousand. “ The offensive operations thus carried into effect have been conducted most successfully. Let Tso Tsim-Tang continue to direct the further advance of the various forces engaged, profiting by the victories already achieved, to destroy or capture with as little delay as possible the rebel leader, Bayen Hu, and to restore to a state of order the territories appertaining to our rule.” Tso-Tsun-Tang’s memorial, upon which the decree above cited is based, was not published until the 16th December. Mr. Mayers then prepared the following summary of its contents as well as the annexed itinerary illustrating the Chinese advance from Turfan to Kucha :— As is almost invariably the case, the memorial published is as silent with reference to the numbers of the forces engaged on the Chinese side, as it is respecting the occurrence or amount of losses which they may have encountered, and the only salient facts to be gathered from the voluminous report now made public are the advance of a Chinese expeditionary force from Turfan, until lately their most westerly position, for a distance of some 400 miles in the direction of Kashgar, terminating in the occupation of Kucha after a hotly contested action, with a force of, at most, five thousand of the enemy's cavalry on the 18th October. “ The only clue to the number of the force under the orders of the Civilian, Lin Kin-Uang, who is acting as General-in-Chief of the invading army, is furnished in the papers heretofore, confidentially obtained, from which it appears that the sum total of the divisions of horse and foot which were to rendezvous at Turfan in the spring of this year did not exceed some twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand men. The tenor of the report now published does not point to the employment of a force even of these dimensions, and it would seem that the bulk of the expedition has consisted in cavalry which had pushed on with extraordinary mobility and speed. The details afforded in Sir Douglas Forsyth's report of his mission to Kashgar enable an itinerary of the route between Turf an and Kucha to be constructed, as is done in the annexed paper in tabular form. Many ol the names of places given m Lin Kin-t ang s icport are at once recognizable in Captain Trotter's route tables, and the distances there given on the authority of native informants, m the local measure by tush, of about four and a halt miles each, have been converted into Lnglish miles in the itinerary now drawn up. * [This aceomit seems to be at variance with M. Golofkin’s telegram above, according to which Karashahr and even Kurla are now in the hands of the Chinese.] Tr.( 224 ) '&lt; It is noticeable that up to the latest dates assigned in the report translated, the Cki te . forces do not appear to have come in contact with the army of Kuh Beg, their encounters at Buy-ar and Kucha having been fought with the adherents of Bayen Hu, the Chinese Mussul. man (Tungani) leader, who was at first at the head of the levo t in Shensi, and who has been suecessively pursued through Kansu, Urumchi, and Turfan, m the course of the last four years It is evident that the battle of the 18th October, under the walls of Kucha, was no easy vi c ] tory for the Chinese, although the enemy's force is not represented as having been dispropor'. tionately numerous, and to judge from the list of officers killed, as published in the decree of the 4 th instant, their loss must have been severe. The region traversed by the Chinese forces and the cities of which they have regained control, appear to be the same with those of which Hakim Khan Tura, the unsuccessful claimant of the sovereignty of Kashgaria on the decease of Yakoob Khan, was for some time in possession, and his recent flight into Russian territory as reported in the European Press, may perhaps have been due to his finding himself menaced both in the rear by Kuli Beg and in front by the advance of the Chinese. “ Whether Lin Kin-t'ang, already four hundred miles from his base at Turfan, and with a strip of waterless desert to cross in his front, will have been able to effect the march of some two hundred and forty miles, which he still had before him to reach Aksu, still remains to be seen. Once at Aksu, he would be within another distance of some two hundred and forty miles from Kashgar, and he could scarcely fail to come, at or near the first-named point, in contact with the army of Kuli Beg. The latter's prowess and material organization must be insignb ficant if he proves unable to resist the further advance of the Chinese force, and these, should they meet with a check at Aksu, will be in so exposed a position as to render their ultimate destruction the most probable contingency.'

Capture of Aksu and Ush Turfan. —The first news of the fall of these two cities was received in a telegram from the British Legation at Pekin, dated 10th January 1878. Eventually a copy of the decree announc ing their capture which appeared in the Pekin Gazette, dated 26th Decem ber 1877, was supplied to the Government of India. 'With regard to the expression which occurs in the decree “ recovering possession of the four cities of Karashahr, Kucha, Aksu and Ush, thus restoring already to our rule the southern portion of the New Dominion,” Mr. Mayers observed that the Nan-lu which includes all Kashgar and Yarkuud is a far larger tract than that which may be considered to have been recovered by the capture of the four cities. He thought that the decree might either mean that the capture of so much of the Kashgar territory left Kuli Beg little chance to defend the rest, or that it might foreshadow some future arrangement for the conclusion of the campaign under which China would be content with the possession of less than the whole of the disputed country. The following is the text of the decree:— “ Tso-Tsun-Tang, Governor-General of Kansu, &amp;c., &amp;c., has memorialized us reporting that our troops have pursued and victoriously engaged the rebellious Muhammadans, and have recovered possession, successively, of the cities of Aksu and Ush. In the campaign for the recovery of the region of Turkestan (or Kashgaria Sin Kiang Nan Lu) upon which the army has been engaged since the recapture of Karashar, Kucha, and the adjacent cities, the Taobai, Lin Kin-Pang has advanced at the head of the forces under his command making a rapid march towards the west, and during the period from the 21 st to the 26th October, he followed up the bands headed respectively by the Kokandian and by Bayen Bu, which were pursued and victoriously engaged, repeated successes crowning his arms with losses inflicted upon the rebels to the number of several thousands. The two cities of Aksu and Ush were successively recovered and the Mussulman population tendered their allegiance in numbers beyond computation. The movements of the army have been alike rapid and successful, and they have exalted in a high degree the prowess of our military powers. Let Tso Tsun- Tang continue to lay his injunctions upon Lin-kin-Pang and the other Commanders with him that they proceed with all prudent care to effect the remainder of the work of conquest, and that they bring their great achievement without delay to a successful conclusion by the capture of Bayen Hu and the rest of the rebel leaders. “ Whereas on the present occasion our forces that have been arrayed for the campaign in the west, whose path has lain amid the boundless waste and under the rigours of an icy season, have within the space of a single month accomplished a march of upwards one thousand miles in length recovering possession of the four cities of Karashar, Kucha, Aksu and Ush, thus restoring already to our rule the southern portion of the New Dominion: it behoves us to write out appropriate tokens of our bounty, in reward for the zeal by our forces in the execu tion of their duty, we command that Lin-kin-Pang do vacate his post as Taobai and become expectant of appointment to office in the rank of Sub-Director of a minor Metropolitan De partment of the third grade. (Here follows a long list of promotions and honors conferred upon the principal military leaders, beginning with general Dan Pa ts J ui). Posthumous honors are further decreed on behalf of the officers killed in action.” 139. Death of the Ameer Yakoob Khan of Kashgar and various accounts of succeeding events— It has been seen in para graph 124 that the Secretary of State suggested that a certain interval should be allowed to elapse before the Mission which the Home Government had sanctioned should start for Kashgar. During this period important changes occurred in that country. On the 16th July the Secretary of State announced by telegraph the reported death of the Ameer of Kashgar, and asked whether the Government of India had any information on the point. None had been received up to that time. But on the 28th August Dewan Govind Sahai, the Cashmere Yakil at Simla, reported that news had been received from Hunza that the Ameer of Kashgar had been assassinated by Hakim Khan Tura, who had been accepted as ruler by the troops and people; that one of the Ameer’s sons had also been slain at Yarkund, and that the second son remained at Kashgar: it ’was( 226 ) added, also, that a revolt had taken place in Sarikol. About the same time similar news arrived through Dir and Peshawar * See telegram to Ambassador, Con- tllC foundation being a repoit Said to have been tember° ple ’ No ' 36C ’ P ” dated 5th Sep * Ina(le tlie Governor of Wakhan to the Mir of Badakshan.^ On the 5th August ACr. Jenkyns, British Joint Commissioner at Leh, sent a messenger to ascertain the state of affairs. Phis man was unable to peng. trate beyond the Suket ravine, where lie met a messengei ot the Central Asia Trading Company on his way from Yarkund to Leh. The latter had left Yarkund on the 29th July and brought a letter of that date from Mr. Dab gleish. The intelligence reported by the two messengers may be sum- marised as follows The Ameer and a younger son had been murdered by Hakim Khan Turn, who assumed command of the army. The eldest son, Beg-Kuli-Beg, had escaped to Kashgar, and, with the aid of the Dadkhwah of Yarkund, had been proclaimed Ameer. In an engagement with Hakim Khan Tura, Beg-Kuli-Beg, being defeated, had ffod, while the Dadkhwah had been taken prisoner. The Governor of Khotan, Kiaz Beg, bad assumed autho rity over all the districts south of Yarkund, and all the roads leading to India bad been guarded to prevent the escape of Beg-Kuli-Beg. The Kirghiz of Sanju had attacked and gained possession of the frontier fort of Shahidulla, and no merchants w T ere allowed to leave Yarkund, though a caravan of Mr. Dalgleish’s had been permitted to pass through without its owner. Mr. Dalgleish’s letter reported that the Ameer had died a natural death at Kurla on the 31st May. No mention was made of his having been murdered. According to an account in the Russian Turkestan Gazette, No. 26 (dated ■pfth July), based on information carried to Fort Yerny by Kashgar merchants, the Ameer had died a natural death at Kurla after 13 days’ illness and had been buried at Kashgar on the May. Before his death, he was reported to have appointed Hakim Khan Tura his successor. The latter, however, refused the throne, and offered it to Beg-Kuli-Beg, w T ho accepted it, and at once addressed a letter to General von Kauffmann asking for his “ good counsel.” Again, t\\e Turkestan Gazette (No. 29) of the mentioned that one Mullah Turan Khoja, who had recently visited Tashkent! as Envoy from Yakooh Beg, and had left again for Kashgar, w r as met on his homeward march by a letter from the latter place, announcing the Ameer’s death, and giving some par ticulars of subsequent events. This letter the Mullah communicated to Gene ral von Kauffmann. It was said to contain the following particulars At the Ameer’s death his second son, Hak-Kuli-Beg, was present, and afterwards escorted the body to Kashgar. On arriving at the city gate, he was met by Beg-Kuli-Beg who at once shot him and massacred his retinue. The country then became divided into three sections, i.e., Toksun and Turfan fell into the hands of the Chinese, Karashahr and Aksu acknowledged the sway of Hakim Khan Tura, while the w'estern districts, including Kashgar, &amp;c., remained subject to Beg-Kuli-Beg. Another account given in the same number of the Turkestan Gazette ascribed the Ameer s death to poison administered bv a Chinese servant. The country was reported to have been offered to Hakim Khan Tura, who refused it, and made it over to Beg-Kuli-Beg, while he himself became Commander-in- Chief of the Army.

No ruler had established himself at Kashgar or Yarkund. On the 17th September a telegram from Major Henderson reported that a reconciliation had been effected between Beg-Kuli-Beg and Hakim Khan Tura, and that the former had been proclaimed Ameer. This intelligence appeared to have been received from a person who had arrived at Leh, on the 8th September, and who had left Yarkund on the 10th August. He also stated that Beg-Kuli-Beg had shot his younger brother Hak-Kuli-Beg at the instiga tion of Niaz-Beg of Khotan, who had charged Hak-Kuli-Beg with harbouring designs against the elder brother. The Ameer had died a natural death at Kurla, whence the body had been conveyed to Kashgar by Hak-Kuli-Beg, and buried at the shrine of Hazrat Afak. On the 10th September Mr. Jenkyns forwarded a later report. A Bokhara merchant, who had left Yarkund about the 27th July, • confirmed the natural death of the Ameer, the murder of Hak-Kuli-Beg by his elder brother, and the latter’s accession to the throne. He added that hearing of the mutinous con duct of the troops under Hakim Khan Tura, at Aksu, the new Ameer and the Dadkhwah marched a force in that direction to restore order; they were de feated, the Dadkhwah being made prisoner and the young Ameer having to fly for his life. In the meantime, one Ishak Jan* had assumed the government of Yarkund. Niaz- Beg of Khotan was reported to be in league with the Chinese: he had raised a laro’e number of troops, and had refused to obey a summons from Beg-Kuli- Beg to appear before him at Kashgar. The whole of the Andijani (Ameer’s) troops were said to have been withdrawn from Kurla and to be encamped at Aksu. According to another account (St. Petersburg Gazette dated 19th October) Hakim Khan 'was defeated by Beg-Kuli-Beg in the first encounter. At any rate it is certain that Hakim was beaten eventually for he sought refuge in Kussian territory at Issykkul and afterwards at Tashkend whither he went under invitation from the Governor. Beg-Kuli-Beg also addressed General Kolpakofski, intimating that he had defeated all his enemies, and was now about to proceed against the Chinese. (Turkestan Gazette, No. 35, dated 6-18th September.) 140. Preparations for despatch of the Mission to Kashgar in accordance with the sanction of the Secretary of State — Upon receipt of the first news of the Ameer’s death the Government of India decided to continue the preparations for the despatch of the sanctioned Mission to Kashgar in case further information should show that circumstances were less unfavourable than they looked. Mr. Shaw, who had returned from England, wrote on the 24th August:—“ The season is so far advanced that any delay would cause a considerable increase of hardship to the followers of the Mission, mostly natives of India, unaccustomed to _ the ex treme cold of Tibet in autumn. I venture to submit that it is advisable to make at once all such arrangements as are possible under present circum stances so that an immediate move may be made as news from Yarkund autho rizes it.’ Some time will necessarily be taken up in preliminary correspondence before actual preparations can be begun. . Meanwhile, every week that elapses without confirmation of the report concerning the Ameer s death reaching Ladak will strengthen the doubts of its truth, and in the same measure the prepara- tions for our departure might be pushed on.” This view of the case was accented and a general sanction was accorded to proposals submitted by Mr. Shaw and Mr EUas, who was to accompany the Mission, and to such prepar ations beino- made as would not commit the Government to serious expense Briefly staged these proposals contemplated the addition of a military and medical officer to the Mission, four Native subordinate officers, and a small pseort A draft of instructions was also prepared, but as these never i^ueifthev°need not he quoted. But on the arrival of the further intelligence above summarized, which left no doubt as to the Ameer’s death and the dis-( 228 ) turbed condition of affairs in Kashgar, the question whether Mr. Shaw should proceed was discussed. In favour of sending the Mission there were the considerations that the presence of a British Envoy in Yarhund might turn the scale in favour of Beg Kuli Beg, and pi event him fiom turuing to Prussia tor aid. On the other side the state ot aifairs m -Kashgar renaered it impossible to say who might be ruler of Yarkund when the Mission arrived. Moreover, no invitation to send an agent had been received from the present ruler’ whoever he might he, and to send one without invitation might place Govern, ment in a false and undignified position, ihe \ ieeioy was inclined to think that Mr. Shaw might advantageously proceed to Yarkund simply and solely as Commercial Agent without any political functions, Inch he might he empowered to assume should circumstances render such a step expedient. Eventually the following telegram, dated 10th October, was despatched to the Secretary of State :— “ After full consideration of the situation in communication with Mr. Shaw we think it best to detain the Mission for the present, but meanwhile to let Beg Kuli Beg be unofficially informed that the Mission from the British Government to the Court of his late father was pre paring to start for Kashgar, but was detained in consequence of the melancholy news of his decease, but that on receipt of official intimation of the accession of Beg Kuli Beg, and an expression of a desire on his part that the provisions of the Treaty in respect to the residence of a British Officer at his Court should be carried out, the Mission would proceed in due course as soon as the passes are opened in the early spring. In the event of Beg-Kuli-Beg’s accession being announced, the Mission will be ready to start by the end of February. Please telegraph your assent to this course.” The Secretary of State replied on the 23rd October:—• On the whole I think you had better make no communication at present. When the season draws nearer, or if the Ameer should express any wish, it will be time to determine whether the country is sufficiently settled to justify a Mission.” Subsequently in a despatch (No. 70, dated 31st October) these instructions were amplified as follows :— “I duly received Your Excellency’s telegram of the 11th October, informing me of the views of Your Government as to the course which should be followed with respect to Mr. Shaw’s deputation to Kashgar, in pursuance of the instructions contained in my Secret despatch No. 31 of the 5th April last, written before news had been received of the death of the Ameer Yakoob Beg. “ Your Excellency in Council proposes to defer Mr. Shaw’s departure for the present, but, meanwhile to cause Beg Kuli Khan, the Ameer’s son and successor, to be unofficially informed, that it had been your intention to despatch a Mission to Kashgar, and that you would be prepared to carry that intention into effect, as soon as the passes are open in the spring, on receiving official intimation of his accession and expression of a desire on his part for the residence of a British officer at his Court. . “ i \ s *^ ou already have learned from my telegram of the 23rd October, Her Majesty s Government are, on the whole, of opinion that, in the uncertainty which at present exists in regard to the state of affairs in Kashgar, it will be better not to make any communi cation to Beg Kuli Khan, but to allow the initiative to come from him. By the time the next ti a veiling season approaches, it will probably he possible to form a more accurate judgment whether the condition of the country is such as to justify a mission, in the event of the new Ameei expiessing a wish for a continuance of the relations established with his father, and that the clause of the treaty providing for an interchange of Residents should be acted upon. Meanwhile I request that any inhumation of a trustworthy character, which may reach you, as o ie piogiess of events in Kashgar, may be regularly furnished to me.” An account of the further proceedings of the Government of India in Connection with the despatch of a mission to Kashgar would carry this precis considerably beyond the period intended to he dealt with. It is sufficient to o iserve here that on receipt of a letter from the young Ameer Beg-Kuli-Beg, e Government of India were disposed to consider favourably a project for sen ing i. Elias, the British Joint Commissioner at Leh, to Yarkund in a vance of the mission which might possibly start in the spring of 1878. u news laving subsequently arrived of fresh disturbances in the Ameers ( ommions, o the continued rapid advance of the Chinese, and finally of the capture ot Kashgar and of the flight of the young Ameer, the proposal was ^andoned.

Intercourse between Russia and Kashgar. Captain Kuropatkin’s mission.— On the-if May 1876 Captain A. N. Kuropatkin left Khojend for Kashgar for the purpose of discussing certain matters with the Ameer Yakooh Beg. He was accompanied by his brother N. N. Kuropatkin, Staff Captain Sunargulof, and an escort of ten Cossacks. The embassy reached Kashgar on the 6th November. Captain Kuropatkin refused to treat with Prince Beg Kuli Beg regarding the boundary line of the Ferghana Province, and demanded an interview with his father, Yakoob Beg. Awaiting a reply from the latter, the embassy was detained over three weeks at Kashgar, during which time the members made themselves acquainted with the city of Kashgar and with Fort Yangishahr. Captain Kuropatkin paid several visits to the bazaar, witnessed the drilling of the Kashgarian troops, and inspected their barracks. He pronounced Yakoob Beg’s forces to be neither superior nor inferior to those of the late Khan of Kokand, and certainly not superior to those of Bokhara. Their arms (especially those of the cavalry) were better, but the best weapon was of little value in the hands of such a heterogenous body as the army of Kashgar. The infantry were chiefly armed with match locks; the cavalry had percussion guns, some of which were rifled. The population was ill-treated, and poor, whilst the discontent against Yakoob Beg was visibly spreading. The chief causes thereof were the forcible conscription for the army, and the oppressions of the officials charged with the collection of taxes. On the 21st December the embassy set out for Aksu. Yakoob Beg was then reported to be residing at Toksun, (Taksan) about 26 miles from Kuna Turfan, and within a journey of four days from Urumchi. The Kashgarian and Chinese armies, one and the other, said to be nearly 50,000 strong, were only separated by the comparatively low range of Davanchi. If he succeeded in reaching Toksun, Captain Kuropatkin intended to return via Urumchi and Manas to Kulja, but if he was stopped near Kucha or Aksu, he would return by way of Karakol.

Visit of Kashgar Envoys to Tashkendin 1875, 1876 &amp; 1877. —The Turkestan (Gazette, dated 19th May 1876, contained an account of the arrival at Kokand of Muhammad Zia and Meer Kasam, Kashgar Envoys, via Tashkend from Aksu (in Yarkund), to visit the temporary new Governor Kolpakofski. They were told that the Russian Government was exceedingly gratified to learn that the Ameer Mahomed Yakoob, Beg had put all the Kokand rebels, who took refuge in his territory, under surveillance. General Kolpakofski hoped that the friendship between the two powers would be maintained. The Envoys in return presented a letter from the Ameer, congratulating the Governor on his appointment. The news given by the Envoys regarding Kashgar affairs was to the following effect:— The Ameer was at Aksu; and his son, Beg Kuli Beg, was administering the Government; the Yarkund Envoy, Syud Yakoob Khan, who returned to Kashgar via Russian territory, had proceeded to Aksu to pay his respects to the Ameer there; that Manas and Urumchi were in His Highness possession, and were garrisoned by 2,000 troops ; that the Tunganis were ready to defend the Kashgar border; that caravan communication between Kokand and Kashgar had been re-opened, and that two Russian merchants, Kaznisuf and Koazuf, were in Kashgar selling tea. The following further particulars of the proceed ings and statements of these Envoys is taken from a later number of the same paper:— “ The Envoys started from Aksu, and were altogether 60 days on their journey. Prom Jityshahr they proceeded to Tokmak, where they allege that news of the annexation of Kokand( 230 ) by Russia first reached them. The Envoys were received by General Kolpako% in a friendly manner. He told them that m the highest administrative circles at St. Pete,/ there existed a feeling of good-will and sympathy towards the ruler of Jityshatr; 1, £ expressed great satisfaction at the course pursued by the Radaulet during the Kokand i nsa[r ! tion, and hoped that amicable relations would continue to be maintained between the K«i. n ' authorities and Yakoob Beg. The Envoys stated that the latter was now at Aksn, and tk . he left Kashgar for the eastern part of his territories five months ago on a tour of imp;*' of his troops, &amp;c. “ According- to accounts given by the Envoys, everything was quiet in the eastern part 0 f Kasho-ar, they did not however give any information as to the Tungani country. They also asserted that the towns of Manas and Urumchi were under subjection to Yakoob Beg whose troops, numbering several thousand men, weie distributed m forts near those towns which are under the rulership of Tungani Governors or Aherns. Nothing was heard of preparations for active warfare on the part of the Chinese troops.^ The fungani levies, in the expectationo! hostilities with China, were distributed among the Kashgar battalions for purposes of drill, to which Yakoob Beg devotes special care. The soldiers are taught military exercises by English instructors according to the system laid down in English drill books, which have been translated into the Afghan and Kashgar dialects. One of these books in the Afghan language contains all the rules of military tactics, and is furnished with many drawings and plans. Before the Mission left for Kokand, three hales of such books had been forwarded from India to Kashgar; they had been lithographed in the Kashgar dialect in East Indian printing Offices. “ Yakoob Beg pays particular attention to military matters, and particularly to the condition of his troops. He has several guns and small arms factories; and small powder mills exist near the cantonments of his battalions. The troops are quartered in barracks; they are kept in good condition, and strict discipline is observed. Yakooh Beg spares nothing to ameliorate the condition of his troops displaying in this respect great self-abnegation as far as the supply of his own personal wants are concerned. He is particularly careful not to waste money on the erection of sumptuous palaces for himself. His infantry soldiers are armed with central fire [breech-loading ?] rifles as was proved by the cartridges in the possession of the Envoys; the Cavalry have muzzle-loading rifies.i “The Envoys affirmed that the Badaulet did not sympathize with insurrectionary move ments in Kokand, bat that he on the contrary placed a cordon of pickets along his frontier to prevent anybody entering Kashgar territories without kis 10 orders was severely punished. Bands of Kirghiz and different emissaries from the leaders of the Kokand insurrection were expelled from Yakoob Beg’s territories. “The Envoys further stated that at first Y T akoob Khan was desirous of mediating with view to an amicable arrangement between Russia and Kokand, and contemplated sending an Envoy to Tashkend. Seeing, however, that the hostile feeling towards Russia did not proceed from the Kokand Government, but from the whole population, he abandoned the idea, and determined to stand aloof while Russia settled accounts with the Kipchak bands. “ During the insurrection no trade caravans were allowed to leave Kashgar; this prohibition has just been withdrawn.” Again, in 1877 the Turkestan Gazette dated yg-th November notified the arrival at Tashkend on the J§th October of Mahmud Khan, a special Envoy from the young Ameer Beg Kuli Beg. Mr. E. B. Shaw gives the following account of this man :— “ Mahmud Khan was formerly commandant of Fort Chakmak in the mountains nortk * See letter from Mr. Shaw, Political Agent on of Kashgar on the road to_ Russian Verny ■ Special Duty, Kashgar, dated 27th December 1874. mati). In the year UTI in December, § 4. (Secret, January 1876, No. 135.) mud bein ^ SUS p e cted of an intention of fleeing through Russian territory into Kokand, the young Prince Beg Kuli Beg rode o K® Kashgar attended by only one servant so as not to excite the fears of the Governor. at Fort Chakmak (a distance usually reckoned as four marches from Kashgar) Beg ul seized the Governor, Mahmud, with his own hands, threatening him with a pistol, an or er the Governors own soldiers to bind him. Thus bound and fastened on a horse, he wasbroug into Kashgar by the Prince and delivered up to the Ameer. This happened w is Bntish officers (Mr. Shaw and Dr. Scully) were at Kashgar. He seems to have been released after some detention and to he again empkjed by ormei captor. He is believed to he a connection of one of the late Ameer’s wives. On the 7th November of the same vear Mahomed Murad Beg, formerly of Oratippe, and nephew of Abdool Gbafur, late Beg of that pia , arrived at lashkend with 13 attendants, as Envoy from Kashgar.

[Secret, August IS76, Nos. 35-38.] [ Turkestan Gazette, dated oth and Vdlh Mag 1876.] [Political, April 1877, No. 72.] 143. Summary of relations between Russia and Kashgar during 1876 from the “Turkestan Gazettes” January and February 1877. —Our relations with Kashgar during the past year were perfectly satisfactory. From the very commencement of the insurrection in Kokand, Yakoob-Beg, the ruler (Badaulet) of Kashgar, showed himself very ill-disposed to the Kipchaks and their doings. Re stationed pickets along the entire line of the Kashgar-Kokand frontier, and guarded strictly against the irruption of Kipchak and Kara-Kirghiz bands into his dominions. He openly declared to the leaders of the Jehad, who applied to him for assistance, that their plots were foolish, and that they would soon have to repent most bitterly. Yakoob-Beg followed this wise and steadfast course up to the very end of the military operations in Kokand. On receiving intelligence of the Russian occupation of Kokand, and of the conversion of the Khanate into the Ferghana Province, Yakoob sent a special envoy to Kokand, who, on the 18th of March, congratulated General Kolpakofski at that place on the occasion of the fresh Russian victories. On the 27th of November, Mahomed Murad Beg, Dadkhwah, another special envoy from Yakoob-Beg, presented himself before the Governor-General with assurances of the Badaulet’s friendly feelings and devotion. On the 1st of August a Kashgar messenger brought a letter to General Kolpakofski at Yerny from Beg-Kuli, the son of Yakoob-Beg. The Governor-General had despatched an embassy to Kashgar in the spring of the year in order to settle the various questions which had arisen, and, among other things, to define the frontier line between Ferghana and Kashgar. The embassy was composed of Captain Kuropatkin of the JEtdt Major, Lieutenants Kuropatkin, Sonargulof, and Mr. Wilkens, attached for the formation of a natural history collection. Captain Kuropatkin left Ferghana for Kashgar on the 15th May, but the disturbances in the eastern part of the region, and the assemblage of Abdulla- Beg’s bands in the mountains, prevented him from proceeding far. On the 25th of April General Skobelef routed a body of Kara-Kirghiz at Yangi-Aryk, and in June there were fresh gatherings of nomads in the defiles of Shott and Turun, and necessitated the advance of several Russian columns. Captain Kuropatkin was obliged to take the command of one of these columns which was marched to the pass leading over the Little Alai. Leading his column at night from Osh towards Gulcha, Captain Kuropatkin was attacked by some Kara-Kirghiz, who were concealed in ambush, and received a wound in the hand. This, together with the agitation in the mountainous district between Ferghana and Kashgar, added to the delay in the departure of the mission to Kashgar. In the beginning of October Captain Kuropatkin again set out for Kashgar, this time from Tashkend, and reached Kashgar on the 25th of October, meeting with a most friendly reception in Jityshahr. By permission of Yakoob-Beg, who was at Turfan, our embassy left Kashgar on the 21st of November, to meet the Badaulet at the eastern extremity of his dominions. While maintaining friendly relations with the Turkestan Government, Yakoob-Beg at the same time did not put stop to his communications with India and Turkey. On learning of the death of the Sultan, Abdul Aziz, andof the accession of Murad V., Yakoob-Beg sent Yakoob-Khan on a mission to Turkey, through India, that person having already been at Constantinople and in Bussia in 1875. During the past year Yakoob-Beg was chiefly engaged in the organization and arming of his troops, in view of the steady progress of the Chinese and of the approach of their army to the frontier of Jityshahr. Turfan, being the nearest town to the eastern frontier, was strongly fortified; the Kashgar army was located at Karashahr and Turfan. Yakoob-Beg was among his troops, hav- ing confided the affairs of his capital to his son, Beg Kuli. Independent of the proximity of the Chinese army, Yakoob-Beg was troubled by the discontent which had made itself manifest among the people, arisino' from the heavy burthen of military service and by the rebellion raised against him by Hakim-Khan Tura, a Beg appointed by Yakoob himself. It is to be borne in mind that Yakoob is not a Kashgarian by birth. He was born at Pskent, near Tashkend; he served all his time in the Kokand army, and always sided with the Kipchaks during the Government of Alim-Koul; he came to Kashgar to assist the Mussulmans against the Chinese. Little by little, he ousted Buzurg-Klian, the rightful ruler of Kashgar, and became absolute master, first, under the title of Atalyk-Ghazi (i.e., Warrior for the Faith), then under that of Badaulet or Fortunate One, and, latterly, under the title of Ameer and as vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. Many people in the midst of the Kashgar population are dissatisfied with Yakoob-Beg. They consider him a usurper and secretly sympathise with the direct descendants of the Hadjas, their former Governors. One of these, viz., Hakim-Khan-Tura, the son of Buzurg-Khan, disclaimed his allegiance to Yakoob-Beg last year, and gathered around him all the disaffected subjects of the severe and despotic Badaulet. It is rumoured that Hakim Khan is in communication with the Chinese, and that he is supported by them. The .cunning Chinese are, in an underhand manner, turning the rebellious Hakim Khan into an instrument for the re-establishment of their power in East Turkestan. The proof of the existence of a disaffection to Yakoob-Beg is, among other cir cumstances, to be found in the fact of. constant immigrations into our territories of Kashgarians escaping from military service, and in the other fact of the transmigration in June last (1876) of 125 Kirghis kibitkas (227 men and 175 women and children) from the Kashgar dominions to the Neryn in our Issyk- kul District. They were overtaken in their flight by Kashgarians at the Kughart pass, when 18 men were seized and 11 were killed, and a great many head of cattle were captured. Among the fugitives were some who were attached to the army of Yakoob-Beg. \MichelVs Abstract, No. XII of 1877.] Appendices to Chapter Y. Appendix XIV.—Memorandum by Mr. R. B.

Fresh insurrection against Khudayar Khan; all parties appeal to the Russian authorities who recognize Nazir- udin’s accession. —The prediction that the peace which followed Khudayar Khan’s victory over Mussulman Koul and the Kirghiz rebels in the autumn of 1874 would not he permanent, was fulfilled. On the 2nd July 1875 the Kipchaks and Kara-Kirghiz invaded Kokand from the direction of Karategin. They were led by Nazir Beg, a nephew of the Khan, and Eoulad Beg, who pretended to be the son of Sultan Morad Beg and grandson of Nar Bota Beg. A detachment was sent against them under the command of Ahdur Rahman—Aftabchi, and Mulla Isa Wall The latter, however was killed, and the Aftabchi joined the insurgents. His defection obliged khudayar Khan to fly for his life, who, accompanied by 500 adherents, moludin 0 * Mirza Hakim and Ata Beg, reached Khojend on the 24th July and claimed the protection of Russia. To guard the interests of Russian subjects in case of necessity, a small detachment of troops was marched from Khojend to the frontier of the Khanate. On the 28th July Nazir-udin, the eldest son of Khudayar Khan, who durum his father’s reign had been Governor of Andijan, and had taken care to preserve kindly relations with the Kipchaks and Khan. He lost no time m sending messengers with Mulla Abdul Kaum at their head to inform the Russians of his accession. They arrived at Tashken on the 12th August, hearing the following letter “Our father having recently introduced many innovations contrary to the Shariat, or religious law of Mussulmans, the peopW thieateuTng attitude of tfie imposed on them, at last refused y * ” After his denarture for your dominions, the God’s goodness towards us.” .

You yourself, high and mighty Governor- General have written repeatedly to the Khan, advising and cautioning him as to his behaviour; but he would never listen to advice, and it is for this reason that we communicate to you these particulars.^ All parties, in fact, were anxious to obtain Itnssian countenance and aid, and the refugee Khan, Khudayar, in his turn addressed the following letter to General Yon Kauffmann:— “ Khojend, August 1th. “ Mighty, &amp;c.,—In my last letter I had the honour of informing Your High Excellency of the difficulties occasioned by the treachery of some of my leading dignitaries. On the 3rd of August matters had got so far that I determined to leave my capital and take up a position outside the town, where I intended to await the rebels. My esteemed guests, Herr von Wein berg and Colonel Skobeleff, accompanied by Mirza Hakim Pervanashi, went with me, and, notwithstanding they were pursued and repeatedly fired at by the mutineers, did not leave me. Only Russians are capable of such magnanimous behaviour. Though my own relations betrayed me, these Russians would not stir from my side. But for them I might not have been able to reach Russian territory. It was Divine Providence which opportunely sent these Russian officers to my aid, and I shall never forget the service they have rendered me. I am now living quietly at Khojend, under the mighty protection of the White Czar, and I have every confi dence that you, my old friend, will not refuse me your assistance in this emergency. God is gracious, and will soon permit us to see each other. The Khanate of Kokand and myself are in your hands and in your power.” General Kauffmann, in reply to these letters, signified his willingness to recognize Nazir-udin, provided the new Khan would acknowledge the Treaties concluded by his father with Kussia. \Turkestan Gazette, No. 2&gt;?&gt;, dated 19^=31^ August 1875.] \Journal de St. Petersbourg, \ &lt; dth=2&gt;\st August 1875.] 145. Commencement of insurrection against Russia; the Aftabchi’s message. —This conciliatory spirit towards the Russian authorities did not last long. Confident in his strength the Aftabchi sent the following message to Tashkend :— “ To all the Russian Tiuras (Chiefs) and functionaries I address the following words:—In view of the deplorable weakness of Khudayar Khan's character, the results of which have shewn themselves in the negligent administration of his subjects, his troops, and of the country in, general: in view, further, of the extortions which he has carried on, a part of our possessions have fallen into your hands—by the will of God Almighty, and owing to our carelessness. The above-mentioned Khan, only thinking of his earthly kingdom, has for several years main tained friendly relations with you, which has discontented us, and obliged us to wait for better times. “ At the present hour the entire population of the country—nomads and settled inhabit ants, the high and the low, in short all who consider themselves Mussulmans—are unanimously agreed to send a numerous force into the neighbourhood of Auliata, and innumerable columns of Dashti Kipchaks to Tashkend. As to us, we are here. “ According to our Shariat it is our duty to make war upon you, for war against you is ordained by the All Omnipotent. If victorious, we must become soldiers of faith; if defeated, we shall be great martyrs. We will aspire with equal zeal to become one or the other. Our Shariat likewise commands us to invite you to embrace the faith of Islam. If you will embrace the true faith and become Mussulmans, we shall be brothers and you must yourself become to us more than brothers. If you refuse, we must fight with you. “We counsel you to embrace Islam, and if, guided by the mercy of God and of the Prophet, you consent thereto, we shall spare your lives, be merciful to you, and esteem you to your advantage. If you refuse to become Mussulmans, but will implore our mercy and ask our permission to depart with your families, we shall still grant your request. But if, on the other hand, you are so ill-advised as to reject our offers, we shall go to war, and one of us must be killed. Whatever you choose, the one is as desirable as the other, and, according to our laws and customs, we shall not renounce (our words) in either case. There is but one God, and we have but one word. “ Having duly weighed the good and evil that may befall you, send us a reply as soon as possible. If the bearer of this letter should verbally acquaint you with our words (proposi tions), we would ask you to believe in what he says.The Russians replied that it was the custom of their country to impose terms upon others, not to have terms dictated to them. Rumours be»an to reach Tashkend that a “jehad” had been proclaimed, and that Kokand troops were in full march towards the Russian frontier. These rumours soon became realities, and about the middle of August the insurgents entered Russian terri tory and penetrated as far north as the Kuraminsk District. Before General Golovacheff could turn them back, they had reached the Chirchik valley, only 20 miles distant from Tashkend, and 70 miles from the Russo-Kokand border. The first report of the violation of territory came from Ablik, a Russian frontier village on the An gran. General Golovacheff set out to meet the enemy with a small force, and news of his victory was received at Tashkend on the llth-23rd August. He reported that the Kokand force of 5,000 men had been driven back into their own territory without any loss on the Russian side. It is evident, however, that notwithstanding the warning they had had, the Russians were taken by surprise. Eor, as the distance between the Chirchik and the Russo-Kokand boundary is about 70 miles, the insurgents had ample time allowed them to run over and devastate the country. However, \rken the Russians once took the field, the breech-loader speedily made up for previous delay. It subsequently appeared that the Kokand invaders had divided themselves into four bands. One of these wms defeated by General Golovacheff, two others recrossed the frontier and escaped, and the fourth, some 800 strong, was attacked and routed by Colonel Elgashtin.

Attack by the insurgents on Khojend— These incursions, however, were merely preliminary. The main effort of the insurgents was directed against the border town of Khojend. The attack, as shown in the following account, though made in considerable force, was unsuccessful:— “ Early in August Lieutenant-Colonel Baron von Nolde received such alarming in telligence from the other side of the frontier that he thought it necessary to quarter a portion of his troops in the suburbs leading to Kokand and to occupy the. bridge over the Syr. On August 20th Baron Nolde—who does not seem to have thought it quite safe to weaken his foiee by patrols—was credibly informed by natives that the village of Samgar, a few miles east of Khojend, had been occupied by the insurgents. The night after the receipt of this intelli gence 30 men, supposed to be Kokandis, attacked von Nolde^s house, but weie scarec away by a few shots. Early in the morning of the 21st a Kokand army, estimatec at more than 20,000 men, attacked Khojend on three sides. About 10,000 infantry endeavoured to storm the Russian position in front of the suburb on the Kokand si e, qui e as many cavalry attacked the bridge over the Syr; while the gate of Nau was assaile y a large force of cavalry and infantry, covering the neighbouring hills. The result was le usua one. The Kokandis, whose clumsy fire-arms have less chance against the breech-loading rifle of these latter days, than the Mexican arrow had against the primitive cannon o ic Spaniards, turned and fled after the first few rounds. The Russian citadel of 10 K n &gt; whither the wives and children of the Russian inhabitants had been sent, was not attacked at all; but the danger was so imminent that the Russian merchants, artisans, and colonists living in and near Khojend, were armed and added, to the garnson o ie or . . any o these civilians were in peril before reaching the protecting ramparts.

The Russians assume tlie offensive. Capture of Makhram —After their successful defence of Khojend the Russians assumed the offensive. Under the command of General von Kauffmann, who had hastened to the scene of action from Tashkend, they marched against Makhram, a fortress on the direct road to Kokand. The enemy, with Abdur Rahman at their head, numbered 30,000 men, and occupied a strong position. The fortress itself was protected by an intrenched camp, surrounded by a m 0 a t full of water. On the 22nd August (O.S.) the position was first she led by he artillery under General Golovacheff and then taken by assault. As the Russian battalions entered the fort the enemy fled and were pursued by General Skobeleff and his Cossacks for some ten miles to the banks of the Svr Darva. The Russian losses were slight, but they included Colonel Khorosh- kin of the Ural Cossacks. The enemy’s^loss is not mentioned, the Russians captured 39 cannon and an immense quantity of munitions of war, standards, &amp;c. {Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated mh August=m September] |- ^ „ 21^ Sepiember=Srd October] r 28^ September—October] 148. General von Kauffmann’s proclamation; occupation of Kokand. —This victory produced a great effect. The neighbouring villages hastened to furnish supplies, and tendered their submission. General von Kauff- mann adopted a conciliatory attitude and issued the following proclamation, dated 22nd August 1875 :— “ People of Kokand, Sarts, Kipebaks, Kara-Kirgbiz, all late subjects of His Highness Kbudayar Khan. “ Certain ambitious persons amongst you, whose names I will not mention, have incited you to undertake a ‘holy war’ against Russia. This war is a senseless one. Any war against the Great White Czar, who grants peace and prosperity to all his subjects, is unjust, and God will never aid those who draw the sword against the Russians. “ Ask the Sarts, ask the Kirghiz, who are subject to the Great Czar, do they not live in comfort and quiet under his gracious protection, or does anybody hinder them from praying accordino- to the Mahomedan rites ? I, the authorized representative of the Great Czar and by his august will Regent of the Turkestan provinces, tell you that the Sarts and Kirghiz are happy under our rule, they grow rich and enjoy peace and quiet. The Great Czar does not infringe the Shariat. The administration of all his subjects is based on righteousness and law. “ The ambitious persons who involved you in war with Russia did not do it for the sake of your weal, but for their own selfish purposes and to gain power. They have behaved ill towards you, and in order to punish them you must capture them, and deliver them to me. i have purposely come with an army to punish the horse-stealers, who have instigated you to make war against the Russians. With the unarmed the Russian soldiers do not fight; but whosoever will be caught with arms upon him, shall not escape the deserved chastisement. “ Therefore lay down your arms, disperse to your homes, and go about your own business, nobody shall touch your property, and anything that the Russian army may require, and takes from you, you shall be paid for. This is the law of the Russians; any other manner of proceed ing is foreign to the soldiers of the Great Czar. “ Your former Lord, Khudayar Khan, I have sent to St. Petersburg. He shall no longer remain Khan over you, for it is known to me that the people of Kokand did not like him. The march of the Russians from Makhram to Kokand was unopposed. On arrival there on the 3rd September the inhabitants, with the new Khan 1\ azir-udin at their head, tendered their submission and restored all Russian prisoners, who appeared to have been well treated. The town was then occupied and a camp formed under its walls. The Beg of Marghilan, Sultan Murad, followed suit. Even the Aftahchi is said to have written a letter offering to yield, and complete tranquillity was believed to have been restored. On the 29th September General von Kauffmann entertained at a banquet and Thirbai Tashkandi Chiefs who had come to congratulate him on the conquest oKokand. Mir Jaliander Shall, the Ex-Mir of Badakshan, was present on both occasions. A Treaty of 28 Articles was drawn up and signed by Nazir-udin on Ins own behalf, and by General yon Kauffraann on behalf of the Russian Government By this Treaty all the territories on the right bank of the river Syr were ceded to Russia. {Journal de St. [ [ [ [ [ Petersbourg, dated September—l^th October 1875.] » « lst=\?&gt;th October YW5.] &gt;) „ 5th = \7tb September.] &gt;&gt; ,, 7th = 19tk September.] }&gt; „ ^th = 2,Yst October.] }&gt; „ Y0tA= 22nd October.] 149. Fresh outbreak. Campaign against Abdur Rahman Aftabchi. But the Aftahehi s surrender, if ever offered, was o nl y a feint. Early in September he assembled 10,000 men at Marghilan—about 45 miles due east of Kokand—but would not accept the battle offered by General Kauffmann, wdio had marched out from Kokand. His troops dispersed in all directions and fled before Colonel Skobeleff’s Cossacks, who drove them across the Kara Su, nor ceased pursuing until they arrived at Osh, some 50* miles north-east of Marghilan. The Aftabchi escaped with five followers, and his place of concealment could not be discovered. On the 15th-27th September the Cossacks returned to Marghilan, where the main body of Russian troops had halted. As the Russian troops approached Marghilan, they were met by a deputation of Elders thirteen miles from the city. These were coldly received and told that they were not to be trusted, for they had harboured Abdur Rahman in dis regard of the Russian proclamation. As a penalty the city was fined, with the consent of the Khan, a sum of 25,100 tilas=Rupees 1,25,000, of which 15,000 tilas were paid up at once. The Beg of Marghilan, Sultan Murad, own brother of Khudayar Khan, joined the Aftabchi, it is said, on compulsion. Another Chief who threw in Ids lot with the Aftabchi was Abdool Guffur, who had left Tashkend without permission, where he was a political pensioner on 300 roubles per mensem. Formerly he had been Beg of Ura Tiube, and afterwards of Talgar, in the valley of Zarafshan. He had fought against the Russians at Makhram. It was rumoured that the Aftabchi had made overtures to Yakoob Beg, Ameer of Kashgar, to make common cause against the Russian infidels. But the Ameer excused himself, saying that his own war with the Chinese necessitated the employment of all his resources. At the same time he took precautions to protect his frontier against violation.

Disturbances at Andijan and expulsion of Nazir-udin from Kokand. —After these victories General Kauffmann, being satisfied that Nazir-udin had been implicated neither in the rising against Khudayar nor in the declaration of war against Russia, recognized him as Khan, and invited him to Marghilan to sign a treaty of submission. This done, the Russian troops left for Namangan, on the right bank of the Syr, some 42 miles N.E. of Kokand. Hardly had the troops crossed the river when the insurrection broke out afresh in the eastern part of the Khanate under the Aftabchi, Sultan Murad Beg, and Eoulad Khan, the pretender to the throne of Kokand. Andijan, some 50 miles east of Marghilan, and about 15 miles north of Osh, was le cen re of the new movement. To crush this rising General Kauffmann sent a nymg column under General Trotsky. The expedition left Namangan on le 28th September (10th October), and comprised 5J compames o m an ^ 2 sotnias of Cossacks, 8 pieces of horse artillery, and a section of 10 c e .as on this occasion that M. Kuhn’s scientific party had a narrow Thev had started for Sharikhan, Asake, and Andijan, intent on col- the Be^s of Sharikhan and Andijan, whilst one of the hands also attacked the quarters of the Russian guests. The gates, however, were closed in time to check the first onset, and the fire-arms of the travellers compelled the rahble to disperse. Advantage was taken of the pause to effect an escape not without much difficulty. Through the street of the town and for the first twelve or thirteen miles they were pursued and fired at by the insur gents To avoid Balychki, a Kipchak settlement, the fugitives passed over the steppe of Marghilan. Towards midnight they crossed the Syr Darya near Minbulak, and at two o’clock in the morning arrived safely in the Russian encampment at Namangan, having accomplished in one day about 53 miles across country. These disturbances had their effect in other parts of the Khanate. On the 9th-21st October the Kipchaks at Kokand, incited by a letter from the Aftahchi, rose in rebellion. They attacked Nazir-udin in his palace, who, after defending it for three hours, fled for his life to Khojend. It was even said that the women of his harem had betrayed him and opened the gates. Kokand was immediately occupied in the name of Koulad Khan by 500 men under Ahdool Guffur, formerly Beg of Ura-Tiube. \Turkestan Gazette for 1875.] [Journal de St. Vetersbourg, %Srd October—let November .] [Turkestan Gazette.'] [Journal de St. Petersbourg, Ihth—'ilth October 1875.] [ Ditto ditto 15^ = 27^ November 1875.] [ Ditto ditto 3(kA November—Y^tk December 1875.] [Turkestan Gazette, No. 24, dated 17M = 29M June 1875.] 151. Movements of General Trotsky’s force.— General Trot sky’s force cpmmenced active measures very soon after reaching Andijan, and met with an obstinate resistance. On the lst-13th of October that town, the centre of the Kipchak popu lation, was taken by storm. On the previous day Colonel Skobeleff reconnoitred the neighbourhood and was received with a sharp fire. At 7 o’clock on the following morning the attack was commenced by a short bombardment, and then Colonel Skobeleff advanced to the assault. The Russians demolished one barricade after another, in spite of the continuous fire of the defenders, after which they fought their way through the narrow streets to the palace square, which formed the centre of Andijan and was the appointed rendezvous of the storming columns. The first and second columns took altogether seven different barricades and captured two guns. The Cossacks especially distinguished themselves. The enemy also dis played great courage, and even after all the columns had met in the central( 239 ) square the defence was obstinately continued. Escaping by back lanes, the Kipchaks returned to their barricades and restored them, while the Eussian troops were resting. The result was that the barricades had to be stormed a second time under a perfect hail-storm of bullets and stones from the roofs and upper floors of the houses. Eventually the Cossacks were obliged to clear the houses at the point of the bayonet, after which the men who followed set fire to them. A band of Kirghiz also attacked the baggage train, but without success. The losses of the insurgents were supposed to have been very great; in the palace alone more than a hundred were killed. The Eussian loss amounted to 12 killed, and 5 officers, 35 privates, and 5 jiggits wounded. Ep to the even ing of the 1st and throughout the 2nd (14th) of October the bombardment was continued to complete the ruin and prevent the inhabitants from saving their burning houses. On his return from Andijan, General Trotsky surprised the Kipchaks in their encampment, and again totally defeated them, inflicting great loss; nearly their whole artillery and 19 banners fell into the hands of the Eussians. As all communications were interrupted, General Kauffmann set out to follow General Trotsky’s force; and, meeting it after its last achievement, the united forces returned to Namangan on the 8th-20th October, just in time to prevent a threatening outbreak.

To watch the Kipchaks a garrison was left in the town of Namangan, and the fortress of Makhram was re-occupied by a sufficient force under Major k] Eodzianko.

The annual revenue payable in kind was valued at 320,000 roubles. The chief town, Namangan, contains some 10,000 houses, and is situated about eight miles from the Naryn and five miles from the Syr Daria. Other towns are Kassan, 2,000 houses; Naukat, 3,000 houses; and Chust, 4,000 houses.

General SkobelelF in Namangan.— The idea that the Russian vie ones md restored complete tranquillity rested on slight foundations. It soon appeared that general anarchy prevailed throughout the Khanate. On the23rd October tbe troops left at Namangan were called out to disperse a gather ing of Kipchaks at Tiuria Kurgan under the leadership of Batyr Tura. Hardly had they quitted Namangan than the inhabitants rose in mutiny and besieged the Bussian troops remaining in the citadel. General Skobeleff after punishing Batyr Tura hastened back, bombarded the town, and having slain nearly 4,000 of the enemy, reduced the place to submission, and proceeded to instal himself in winter quarters. The Kipchaks, how ever, declined to surrender. They retreated to Balychki,* on the left bank of the Syr, where they established themselves in some force under Wali Khan Tura. It was absolutely necessary to inflict a signal blow upon them. On the night of the llth-23rd of November a flying detachment of four companies of infantry, one company of mounted fusiliers, 4J sotnias of Cossacks, four rocket stands, six pieces of artillery, and a platoon of sappers, set out from Namangan. It forded a side channel of the Naryn and, continuing the march through the night, surprised the enemy before daylight, took Balychki by storm, and returned to Namangan the next day. Major Bodzianko, too, on the 29th October, defeated a body of Kipchaks who had encamped at Ti german Bashi in the neighbourhood of Tort Makh- ram. This victory, which cleared the neighbourhood of insurgents, enabled Nazir-udin Khan to return to Kokand. He left Khojend on the 31st October (12th November) under escort, as far as Fort Makhram, of half a sotnia of Cossacks. The troops were thanked for their services by General von Kauffmann, and the special favors of the Czar solicited for those who had most distin guished themselves. 155. Capture of Andijan. Further campaign of General Skobeleff. —Notwithstanding these defeats the Kipchaks continued their efforts to stir up a religious war. Their conduct convinced General von Kauffmann that further measures were necessary before Bussian authority could be considered as established on a firm basis in the new province. Therefore, when leaving Namangan under military occupation, he instructed General Skobeiett to marc towards the end of December to Ak-i-Sabrasi, between the rivers Naryn and Kara-Darya, the centre of the Kipchak country, and strike a decisive blow. This time was chosen because, owing to the snow, _ the Kipchaks would be encamped in the plains and unable to take refuge m the n s. erv\ ar s the force was to march upon, and destroy, if necessary, Andijan, e ipc centre in another part of the Khanate. Accordingly on the 25th December 1875 (6th January 1876) General Sko- Meff again started from Namangan with a detachment of 2,800 mem whic h , on the following day, crossed the Kiver Naryn near the vrUage of Ba^-Bat .

The following detailed narrative of Foulad s career is interesting . “ From the commencement of the late commotion in Kokand, which began with the rising a.o*ainst Khudayar Khan, rumours were rife that the principal leader of the insurrection, and pretender to the throne of Kokand, a personage calling himself loulad Khan was an impostor. Recent investigations have fully confirmed the truth of these rumours, and enable us to publish his correct history. The investigation of the matter was entrusted to Nazir Khan Sufi Beg, at present a resident of Samarkand, who, being himself a pretender to the throne °f Kokand, was naturally interested in discovering the real antecedents of the impostor, and elicited the following facts:— “Narbut Khan of Kokand (1779-1792) was succeeded by his eldest son, Alim Khan (1792- 1801) who was followed by his brother, Umar Khan (1801-1821). The latter expelled all pretend ers to the throne from the Khanate, among others the sons of his brother, Atalyk and Murad, who were banished to Karategin, from whence Ameer Nazir Ulla afterwards took them to Bokhara, where both married. After a short time, however, both brothers had cause to be dissatisfied with the Ameer's hospitality, and, having received his permission to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca, departed—Atalyk to Balkh, and Murad to Khiva, where they remained respectively. In 1843 the Kokandis grew disaffected with the rule of Shir Ali Khan (1840-1844),* and invited Atalyk, then residing at Balkh, to become their Khan. The latter invaded Kokand, but was defeated by Shir Ali Khan at Kara-Yasy, losing his own life in the battle. In the following year his brother Murad returned to Bokhara (with the Ameer's consent), accepted an invitation of the Kokandis, collected a considerable force, and succeeded in dethroning Shir Ali. His reign, however, lasted only nine days, for Mussulman Koul, a Kipchak General of Shir Ali's army who had managed to save the latter's sons, assassinated Murad, and proclaimed Khudayar (Shir Ali's eldest son, then fifteen years of age) as Khan of Kokand (1844). “ Six years after the death of Atalyk, his widow chose Samarkand for her residence, to which place she removed together with her children: Foulad (Atalyk) Khan (then a boy of seven years), and a daughter, who was married to Mahomed Rahim Subkhankoul, the Mutayali of the Madrassa Khoja-Akhrar of Samarkand. Subsequently the latter adopted his wife's brother, young Foulad Khan. In the course of time this young Prince became gradually reduced to a state of beggary. About four years ago he repaired to Kokand, in order to sue for the inheritance of his father's property, but was arrested by Khudayar Khan, and only released in deference to his sister s prayers, who went personally to plead for his liberation. Ever since his return from Kokand, he has lived in obscurity at Samarkand, dwelling in a miserable cell adjoining the Madrassa Khoja-Akhrar, and, owing to his utter penury, his existence was known but to few persons. His identity, however, has been fully established by the evidence of several men and women who knew him in his infancy, particularly by a fault in his left eye, and permits of no doubt whatever. He has taken no part in the late rebellion. The man who personated him is one Mulla Ishak, a tobacco-seller from Pskent, a village in the district of Kuraminsk, and this is bow he came to represent Foulad Khan. * His father, Mahomed Ali Khan, reigned from 1821 to 1840.( 243 ) In the early part of 1874 the principal leaders of the anti-Khudayar (Kipchak) party ■ viz,, the Kirghiz Turdy Bai (an uncle) and the Kipchak Mussulman Koul (a nephew to Mulla Alim Koul), the Kipchak Sarymsak Bai from Chatkal, Kalendar Kyrk Yuz from Kosh-Tigerman, and Bataheg Bai from the village of Usman (district of Khojend), intending to depose Khudayar Khan, offered the throne to Abdukarim Khoja Khan, a relative of the former, who was then residing at Khojend. The design of these conspirators was soon disclosed, and before they had reached Khojend, the local (Russian) authorities removed the chosen pretender to Tashkend, where he was put under police surveillance. Upon this they followed him to Tashkend, where they could naturally do nothing to further their plans. On the way back they hatched a new idea, which was to proclaim foul ad Khan, the son of Atalyk; and, finding a man somewhat resembling Foulad in the person of the above-named Mulla. Ishak of Pskent, they induced him to play the part of the pretender they wanted. Spreading a report that they had fetched the real Foulad Khan from Samarkand, they next collected a force of Kipchaks and Kirghiz, and advanced on Namangan. The defeat of KhudayaFs troops at Kure-Kassan, though insignificant in itself, greatly increased the importance of the pseudo Foulad, and Khudayar’s position had even at that early stage become critical, although the Aftab- chi Abdur Rahman, had not yet turned traitor. The latter’s victory over the insur- o-ents at Fort Kassan (July 1874), and the execution of Mussulman Koul on the battle field did not quench the commotion, which spread until nearly the whole Khanate was involved in a ‘ holy war ’ against Russia, and Khudayar Khan lost his throne (August 1875). When Nazir-udin Khan became Ameer of Kokand, the impostor appeared before him with a declaration of submission, but was arrested at Makhram, whence he managed to escape while General von Kauffmann was taking possession of it. After the expulsion of Nazir-udin his influence increased, but he was obliged to share the honor with the Aftabchi, who knew perfectly well with whom he was dealing. “ To this interesting biographical sketch of the real and the false Foulad Khan, for which we (Turkestan Gazette) are indebted to the kindness of Mons. G. Arendarenko, we may add : That after his flight from Makhram the impostor was above all obliged to take care of his own head, which explains why he disappeared for some time; it was only after the fresh risino- at Andijan that he found a safe opportunity to re-appear on the political scene. Ttie°mutiny of Andijan was caused by the conscription of Nukers for Khan Nazir- udin’s army; nobody would serve the unpopular new Khan, and all persons who were com manded to join his forces deserted into, the hills, and gathered about the banner of the pseudo pretender, while the rest of the population rose under the leadership of the Aitabchi, But although both parties unanimously hated the Russians, they were by no means staunc friends among themselves, and throughout the war they never once really acted together m the same field. Thus, while our Namangan detachment was inflicting defeat upon defeat on the forces of the Aftabchi, the impostor was keeping aloof; and only after the former had been capture by the Russians—he surrendered himself to General Skobeleff , at the village of Hindu, on the 24th January (5th February 1875)—did Foulad (Mulla Ishak) come to the foreground, commenc ing his operations with a series of cruelties, including the massacre of Russian prisoners of war at Marghilan, and the murder of Abdur Rahman’s (the Aftabchi s) three brotheis. The following letter regarding Foulad Beg, dated the 10th-22nd March 1876, was written by Mahomed Hahim Shah, Baler of Karategm, to Geneia Kolpakofski at Kokand:— , „ r , , “ The silly and low-born usurper, Foulad Khan (Foulad Beg), carried ajy by fo °hsh a nd impracticable designs, contemplated the seizure of Kokand and 0 6 reins „ p “ Seeking to renew his former animosities against me he married the daug ter o uza a ^ Shah (a former Beg of Karategin), who is connected with me by marr ^ e ; eo ^ 1 U e 11 ^ 1 . e ^ olt b b ut of Khudayar, he several times invaded my dominions and strove to rouse the people to revolt, “ After his marriage he gave one of M uzUarA smm tiie^rank ^Situted his 500 men); another son he made his Ireasurer.

(Abstract XI, 1870.) “ Muzafar Shah and his Secretary told Mr. Fedchenko that their country, Karategin, was in ancient times called Yagan,t and included Darwaz. He gave the following illustration. Striking his chest, he said that was Karategin, Macha was the right hand Darwaz the left ; the right leg was Hissar, and the left leg Kolab. Kokand, he added, was the head. lor 50 years (up to 1871) Karategin was tributary to Kokand Nazarot (1813) saw envoys from Darwaz in Kokand. Rahim Shah, having profited by Bokhanan aid, resisted the attempts of the Khan of Kokand to reduce him to submission to Ferghana. “Muzafar Shah further told Mr. Fedchenko that Hodja-Balai-Ansari marked the boundary between Karategin and Bokhara, hut he supposed that Rahim Shah Puchuk (the pug-nosed) had ceded some of the Karategin territory to the Ameer, or to Yakoob, the Beg of Hissar. “ Muzafar Shah is only 34 years of age; he is a man of immense size, and wears a long black beard. He was disliked by the hill tribes for his exactions and cupidity and it was in order to save his treasure that he fled from Gharm on the mere approach of Rahim [Turkestan Gazette, No. 8, dated ZUh February— 1th March 1876.] [Secret, June 1876, No. 63.] \Secret, May 1876, No. 20.] 157. Kokand annexed by Russia and named the Province of Ferghana. —In consequence of the continued disturbances described in the preceding paragraphs, the Russian Government resolved to annex the enthe Pio- vince of Kokand. Ferghana was chosen as its title, this being the old historical name of the valley of the Upper Oxus. It was attached to the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Turkestan, and included in that military circle. The local administration was entrusted to a Military Governor with command of the troops cantoned in the district. To give formal notice of these orders General Kolpakofski, who had temporarily succeeded General Kauffmann as Governor-General ot Turkestan, leftTashkend on the 7th-19th February and, entering Kokand in state on the 15th-27tk, issued the following proclamation ; — “DKAS. “We, Alexander II., &amp;c., yielding to the wishes of the Kokandi People ‘to become Russian subjects/ and likewise recognizing the absolute impossibility of restoring the Khana e to peace and tranquillity by any other means: command that the Khanate of Kokand be immediately incorporated with our dominions, and that it shall henceforth form the ‘ Ferghana Province ’ of our Empire ! “ Given at St. Petersburg on the 2nd (14th) February 1876.” * His genealogy is as follows:—Shah-i-Darwaz, Shali-Tut, Ibrahim-Khan, Isinael-Khan, Shah-Turk, ^ Shah, Has-Iskander, Shah-Kirghiz, Shah-i-Darwaz, Mussamir-Khan, Shah-Abdu-Nabi, Zuinbra-Shah, Naya la &gt; Abul-Aziz-Khan, Muza/ar-Shah. f Macha, on the Upper Zarafshan, belonged to the Begs of Yagnau, and was equally tributary to Kokand. (Nazar of and others.) X There is a similarity in this with the Yagnau or Yagnab in the Zarafshan Valley, from which the former may have been distinguished by the addition (?) of Kar (pore Turk for snow); hence it was called Kartaghan.

He tendered his submission, and arrangements were made for sending him with the Aftabchi to Tashkend. When the Russians entered Kokand on the 21st February, Abdool Guffur Beg was at a mosque in the city, but left at once for Balkh. {Journal de St. Pelersbourg, dated Qtk~\^th March 1876.] {Turkestan Gazette, No. 7, dated \lth~l^tk February 1876.] {Turkestan Gazette, No. 8, dated lUh February—1th March 1876.] {Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated Srd—\'bth March 1876.] i V‘: J t 158. General condition of the new Province.— The defeat of the Kipchaks produced a marked impression both on the turbulent elements of Ferghana and upon the neighbouring Khanates. The latter had maintained a very equivocal attitude during the operations against the Kipchaks. Not daring to interfere directly, they held their troops in readiness on the frontier to be directed against the Russians in the event of their being worsted. Their con duct changed after the conquest of Kokand. The Chief of Karategin refused an asylum to Fqulad Beg, took advantage of the latter’s misfortunes to seize his property and treasure, and sent an embassy to General Kolpakofski. Yakoob Beg of Kashgar—who, foreseeing what the ultimate result must be, was acting with the utmost circumspection during the war—also sent an embassy. The enquiry at Marghilan into the murder of the six Russian prisoners and the Ex-Beg, Ata Koul Batyrbashi, was continued. Mulla Kurshai and Taria Azan, two notorious brigands, who were conspi cuous in pillaging the Khan’s palace at Kokand, were arrested at Chust. A Special Commission, convened at Kokand, was charged with the duty of collecting information, to enable taxation to be fixed on a suitable basis, and to determine what property belonged to the Khan. Garrisons were established at the principal towns of the province, such as Kokand, Marghilan, Namangan, Andijan, Osh, and Chust. The citadel of Kokand was fortified. The income of Ferghana for 1876 was estimated at 6/9,000 roubles, and foi 1877 at 1,360,000 roubles. The cost of the civil and military administrations was fixed at 391,700 roubles for 1876, and at 523,892 for 1877 ; to these figuies must be added 1,662,300 roubles for extraordinary expenditure. It is stated that after the annexation of Ferghana trade between that province anc Tashkend made a remarkable advance, and that the transactions were tai in excess of those prior to the war. {Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated Mth-^rd June 1876.] Ditto ditto \4,h- ,\6th May\310?\ Ditto ditto llth — V6rd May 1876.] Ditto ditto 30th May—Wth June 1876.] 159. Administrative arrangements in Ferghana— General Kolpakofski divided the new province into seven districts. The chief executive officer in four of them appears to have been a native, and m ie o icr nee Russians. The districts were— I. Kokand, including Makhram and extending as far as the Tashkend border. II. Marghilan, comprising Asake and Araban. III. Andijan. IY. Osh. V. Chamian. VI. Namangan, including Kassan and Gharnas. vr l i ^ rio-ht VII.

Abdulla Beg, Omar Beg, and Suliman Koul, however, still held out. ^ About the same time another party of Kirghiz rose in rebellion at Langar, near Chemir in the mountains south of Kokand, and proclaimed a fakir named Khuda-Koul their Khan. It was believed also that Abdool Guffur, the Ex-Beo* 0 f Ura-Tiube, and his son were concerned in this movement, but the fact was not established. The rising was speedily suppiessed by a force dispatched by General Kolpakofski under Colonel Korolkof and Major Twede, and tribute was exacted from the Kirghiz of Chemir. General Skobeleff undertook a reconnoissance from Gulcha, advancing through the valley of that name, and met with no resistance. He occupied the valley°with a small detachment, and commenced building a fort which would command the road from Terek Davan to Kashgar, and assure the position of the troops quartered in the Gulcha valley.

Area and population of territory subject to Governor- General Of Russian Turkestan.— Regarding the area of Kokand, which has been recently incorporated with the Russian Empire, a new calculation by Strelbitski is under preparation. In the meantime the old figure, IjSBQ GC German geographical square miles=73,215 square kilometres, is given. With reference to the number of inhabitants, the whole population, composed of Sarts, Tajiks, Kirghiz, Uzbeks, and Kipchaks, is estimated by von Kuhn at 132,000 hearths or houses, and 60,000 tents of nomads. This estimate is based on official documents of the late Khan’s Government, and, reckoning five souls per each house or tent, the result shews a total population of 960,000 souls. The district of Namangan on the north side of the Syr Darya, the first Russian acquisition taken from Kokand, has (according to Strelbitski’s new calculation) an area of 7,766*5 square versts = 160*52 Germ, geogr. sq. miles = 8,838*7 sq. kilom., and is approximately said to have a population of 190,000 souls (25,000 settled, and 13,000 nomad families). The major portion of the settled population are Sarts, whilst the Kirghiz constitute the majority among the nomads. Against Kuhn’s statements referring to the Amu Darya District, shewing a population of 220,000 souls, A. Vambery quotes “ the latest official statistical returns,” according to which this district is said to have but 109,600 inhabi tants. He says:—The Amu Darya District is subdivided into two circles (Bezirke) : the circle of Shurakhan, and that of Chimbai. The former extends from the Bokharian frontier to the northern extremities of the Sheikh Jelil Hills; the latter from these hills to the shores of the Aral. The Shurakhan circle, forming for the most part a low plain, is principally peopled by settled inhabitants, whereas the population of the Chimbai circle consists chiefly of nomads. Thus, according to the latest official statistical returns, the circle of Shurakhan contains 1,932 Uzbek, 131 Sart, 111 Bokharian, 18 Irani, 47 Arab, and two Tartar houses, or, in all, 2,241 fixed homesteads, whilst the number oftents (the inhabitants of which, however, are entered as half-nomads) amounts to 1,970, viz.) 1,170 of the A.ta Turkomans, and 800 of the Karakalpaks. There are also said to he 2,444 Kirghiz tents, which raises the total to 6,655 houses and tents, or a population of 33,275 souls (five per house or tent). The Chimbai circle, which differs very materially from that of Shurakhan, contains only 675 Uzbek houses, but 10,709 Karakalpak tents, and 3,878 tents of various nomads—in all 15,262 homesteads, or 76,310 inhabitants as above. The total population for both circles of the Amu Darya District amounts to 109,585 souls. Summary of area and 'population of the Russian Governor ^Generalship of Turkestan. Territories.

The other, to develop Russian trade which had hitherto depended on the caprice of the Turkomans, and place it on a firm basis. During 1874 but few caravans had reached Khiva from Orenburg, while from the Caspian side no route had yet been established. The detachment, consisting of some 1,600 men, started from Port Petro- Alexandrofsk on the January and reached Nukus on the |f, but the passage of the river was not effected until the 11} January. The following account of its further movements appeared in the Imalide Jtusse :— « After having crossed the Amu, the Russian detachment marched towards Kuna Urganj. Colonel Ivanoff, before starting, sent through the Beg of Khoja Hi proclamations to all the Turkoman tribes, inviting them to submit. From Kuna Urganj the force proceeded to surprise an encampment of Koul Yomuds, a tribe numbering 1,000 tents, who had rendered themselves specially obnoxious. In August 1864 they had plundered a Persian convoy; after that they had refused all supplies, remained disobedient to the Khan, and had attacked his Dewan Mahomed Niaz, who had been sent in June 1874 to exhort them to obedience. They were taught a salutary lesson: all their encampments within a radius of three miles round the Russian camp at Boyudur were burned, their cattle was confiscated, and only the lives of tie inhabitants spared. One of their Chiefs, Bakar, who had directed the attack against the Persians, was arrested and sent to Khiva, after which the Yomuds retired m a westerly direction towards Sary Kamysh. “ The report of this chastisement was soon known among the surrounding population and a fresh demand for submission, sent to all the Turkoman tribes, was quickly complied with, except by the Yomuds of Kazavat, who still hesitated. At Iliali _ the Russian troops were accorded a most cordial reception. Here the news was also received that the lomuds ot Kazavat had made their submission. The Bairam Yomuds were^next reduced, and on tie 1 7th the detachment commenced its march towards Kosh Kupyr.” Near Khiva, Colonel Ivanoff met the Khan, and a day was spent in discuss ing the affairs of the Khanate. On his Avay to Khanki, where, on the 20th January, the troops re-crossed the river, Colonel Ivanoff paid a formal visit to the Khan and met with a cordial reception. On his departure the Khan charged him with the following letter to General Kauffmann :— “We wish you good health always, a complete greatness, and a just and merciful go\ em inent ! “ After this testimony of sincere and heartfelt wishes, may the high attention of Your Excellency learn what follows. On the occasion of the disobedience to our orders ot our Turkoman subjects, and their incessant outrages on the tranquillity of our Uzbek subjects, vve wrote in the autumn to the Honorable Colonel Ivanoff to ask him to chastise once again the Turkoman rebels. When Colonel Ivanoff acquainted Your Excellency with this request, you were pleased to authorize the chastisement of the Turkomans, in view to bring them o obedience. According to your orders. Colonel Ivanoff and his troops immediately crossed over to the left bank of the Amu, and marched to Khojeili and Kuna Urganj. After the pums i- ment of the Koul Yomuds as far as Kazavat, he swept all the Turkoman encampments, burning the dwellings of the rebels by way of chastisement, but doing no harm to those w io submitted. Prom Kazavat Colonel Ivanoff returned to Kosh Kupyr, where we met mm, passing two days in the midst of his troops, after which we followed him into our capita . Having there entertained him for two days, we reconducted him with all his men, and t ie troops re-crossed to the right bank of the Amu, off Khanki.“We hope that the Turkomans, after haying seen Russian troops in their eneamnments will behave submissively, and that tranquillity will be re-established in our country To o&gt;i V p us this tranquillity, you authorized graciously the Russian troops to traverse our dominions for which we thank you. ; “ Should you be pleased to condescend to bring the foregoing facts to the notice of His Majesty the all-powerful Sovereign, you will place us under the obligation of always pray in &lt;&gt; for the preservation of your good health.” j s [Turkestan Gazette, No. 11, dated \lth-Z%rd March 1875.] [Translation by Michell from &lt;e Russian Invalids ” 28a February [Y'Uh March) 1875, Secret, May 1875, Nos. 56-63.] [Journal de St. Fetersbourg, dated ZUh March.'] 163. Results of Colonel IvanolTs Expedition— The results of the expedition were said to have been in the highest degree satisfactory. Peace and order were restored to the Khanate, and the Turkomans paid up a large portion of the fine imposed on them by General Kauffmann in 1873. Early in the spring the Khan made a tour in the Turkoman country. He started from Kuna Urganj, visiting the camping grounds of the Kulchar Turkomans by way of Khoja Hi intending to reach Porsu next day, and to return to Khiva likewise by way of the same camping grounds. During his stay at Kuna Urganj, he imposed on the Yomuds, who lived in the neigh bourhood of that town, a yearly tax of 2,400 tillas. The Choudor Turkomans were mulcted in an annual tribute of 600 tillas. The amount of the tax is fixed in proportion to the quantity of ground occupied by the tribes, and by the number of men supplied for the Khan’s service. The rate is inconsi derable, hut the total amounted to 73,380 roubles. The Khan took special measures with the Yomuds of Kuna Urganj, whom he compelled to liberate 20 Persian slaves. Eifteen more slaves, consisting of women and children, were rescued from a body of Koul Yomuds who had decamped in the direction of Sary Kamysh. Only ten executions took place throughout the whole expedi tion, and the subjects of this severity were those whom the Turkomans them selves denounced as the worst and most dangerous men of the tribe. In August 1875 the Khan undertook a fresh tour with an escort of 400 men and one piece of artillery. He met with no opposition, except on the part of the Kara Choudors under Mahomed Essaul-Bashi, a nominee of his own. He w T as immediately arrested and the Kara Ghoudors abstained from violence. “The relations with the Akhal Tekke,” said the Turkestan Gazette, “are of the most peaceable and amiable nature, hut the Turkomans of Merve from time to time still undertake raids into Khivan and Bokharian territory, and will probably continue to do so until we teach them another sharp lesson.

Russia, the Khan of Khiva, and the Turkomans of Khiva.—The following article from the Moscow Gazette, dated 4th-16th March 1875, presents an interesting picture of the Bussian view of the position o e Khan of Khiva and the Turkomans settled in his country : “ The object of both expeditions* was the same, to punish the Turkomans for their refusal to pay the contribution imposed on them after the capture of Khiva, and to compel them to yield obedience to the power of the Khan, which they have hitherto regarded as only nominal. “The Turkoman question is one of the greatest importance h 1 the Khanate of Khiva. The whole history of the Khanate has latterly consisted of stiugg es e ween icse ' population and the semi-nomad Turkomans, who occupy the outlying limits of the Khanate. * Colonel Ivanoff’s expeditions of January 1874 and 1875 are referred to.TheS e T— ^ o rSr E Ml T T h 4 £ “StuS trailed to comprehend the matter. . “ Tlie cirC ^'1Z“ of theTown!

X, “ The extraordinary circumstances which characterized the capt ure of Khiva, were not the result of a,iv accident, but proceeded from the condition of things m the Khanate. The Khon was ready to submit to the Russians, and to fulfill their demands, but failed in obtaining the submission of the Turkomans. He. declared himself unable to compel them to submit to his demand. There was no organization among the Turkomans which Russia could relv on General Kauffmann, with a view of forcing them to respect our authority, demanded uavment of a contribution. Simultaneously with its demand, it was necessary to enforce its payment, and hence proceeded a series of expeditions. Could any reliance have been placed on the friendliness shown by the Turkomans towards the Orenburg detachment? We have to deal with Turkomans, not only on the Khivan frontier, but also on the shores ot the Caspian. The Caspian Turkomans have, on several occasions, displayed a willingness to become Russian subiects. On the occupation of Krasnovodsk orders were given to maintain friendly relations with them. Rumour said that Colonel Stoletof was recalled for having inflicted punishment on some Turkomans. We saw, however, that his successor Colonel Markozof, was obliged to engage in an expedition against the Turkomans, and to burn their habitations aud property like Generals Kauffmann and Golovachof. The present Commander of the Caspian Region General Lomakin, as the Invalids informs us, succeeded at first m establishing friendly relations not only with the Turkomans under Russian rule, but likewise with the neighbouring Tekke Turkomans. A year, however, had scarcely elapsed, when the friendliness of the iurko- mans terminated in such an act of brigandage that General Lomakin was obliged to under take a reconnaissance or expedition (they are nearly synonymous) into the country ot tbe Turkomans. “ The establishment of the rule of the Khan is another matter. Strangely enough m Kokand we do not interfere in the internal feuds that prevail there ; in Bokhara we subdued the rebellious Begs for the Ameer, to whom we surrendered the possessions of these Begs, m spite ot the wishes of the population to recognize Russian rule. In Khiva, according to the Invahde, we demand ‘ complete obedience to the Khan/ “ If for certain reasons it proves necessary to secure the authority of Central .Asiatic despots by the terror inspired by our arms, it is likewise necessary for Russia to exercise immediate con trol over their actions, and to give heed to the complaints of their subjects, in the event ot any abuse of their power thus guaranteed by our authority.” [Secret, June 1875, No. 165.] 165. Russian trade with Khiva in 1875 and 1876 — During the first named year twenty caravans were despatched to Khiva, and ten from Khiva to Krasnovodsk. Erom 1st January to 15th November the value of the export trade to Khiva was estimated at 200,000 roubles, and the import trade from Khiva to Russia at 360,000 roubles. The principal articles of import were silk aud fruit; aud of export, wine, brandy, leather, cloth, palm- wood, petro leum, hardware, aud sugar. In 1876 a caravan of 800 camels from Khiva laden with cotton, silk, hides, and furs, arrived at Krasuovodsk on the May, whence the goods were shipped via Baku aud Astrakhan to Nijni. Its total value was estimated at 150,000 roubles, or about £21,430. During the last part of its journey the caravan was escorted by a sotnia of Cossacks, sent by the Viceroy ot theCaucasus. With it arrived 200 former Persian slaves of both sexes, chiefly natives from the Mazandaran Province, who were liberated by the Russians in 1873.

The following is taken from the Turkestan Gazette l&lt; If English officers would visit Central Asia simply as tourists, scientific explorers, press correspondents, &amp;c., the Russian administration would not even think of putting any obstacles in their way. Witness Major Wood^s journey with the scientific Amu-Darya expedition, or the travels of Dilke and other English tourists in Turkestan. These gentlemen were everywhere heartily welcomed while travelling, and in every way assisted to accomplish their objects. But the English are not satisfied with this, and systematically endeavour to injure the Russians in Central Asia. At one and the same time, while the Turkestan administration is doing its best to bridle the Turkomans, to close the cultivated parts of Central Asia and Persia against them, and to eradicate slavery—this sore of Asia, in view to which it keeps down the Yomuds and Tekkes, the principal slave-suppliers—the English furnish arms of the latest pattern to these same Turkomans, thereby encouraging them to persevere in their depredations. Can such conduct be called worthy of a civilized State ? And whom do the English harm by their ‘stupid - ’ hatred, and by such ‘ tactless ’ proceedings? Certainly not Russia. Should the Turkestan troops ever be called upon to fight the Tekkes, or to march on Merve, there can be no doubr, whatever that the Tekkes will be defeated, despite the possession of modern arms and the most desperate resistance on their part. In order to overthrow the invincible (4ron J ) Turkestan troops, good arms alone are not enough; were it not so, our Turkestan army would not be worth a farthing, and the future of the Russian power in Central Asia should be regarded as something very shaky indeed. On the other hand, we are not prepared to say that the possession of English arms is altogether devoid of advantage to the Turkomans. They use them in their raids on the neighbouring Persian, Khivan, and partly the Afghan territories, which are undertaken for the purpose of capturing slaves. Who then is playing the nobler part in Central Asia ? Russia, annihilating slavery, or England, supporting it ? “As regards Kashgar, it is useless to say a word. England s tender care fox the improve ment and organization of Yakoob Beg’s army is certainly not based on friendship for Russia. “ And what straits is the Russophobist Press not having recourse to, in order to misinter pret (‘throw a shade upon’) the latest actions of the Russian Government in Central Asia. A Russian soldier, who is held a prisoner by the Tekkes, is happy in his captivity, and has not the least desire to return to his regiment, says one of the English papers, naively feigning to e icve the stories of the Turkomans. We doubt that the Turkomans could have so much as told such a bare-faced he to Captain Burnaby; it is simply an invention of the English paper. _ Ihe Turkomans, though regarding the capture of slaves as a profitable trade, which m their opinion is sanctioned by the custom of ages, at least do not attempt to pioye. y jcsui ica S0 P 1 T a they are thereby conferring a blessing upon the victims of then trace, .-mg is wn ers imagine that they are already facing a most alarming state of affairs.

Russian Trade with Bokhara.—Towards the end of 1874, the stock of Russian goods in Bokhara was said not to exceed a valuation of 400,000 roubles. During 1875, however, considerable consignments were sent thither. Complaint was made of the high imposts levied at Bokhara on Russian goods, amounting to 10 copecks per rouble (or 10 per cent. 100 copeeks=l rouble). [Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated 29M May-YQth June 1875.] 168. Exploring Expedition to Hissar—Having obtained the con sent of the Ameer of Bokhara, an expedition consisting of Mr. Mayef, Sub lieutenant Yishnefski, and Herr Schwartz, started in May 1875 to explore Hissar. They were warned to beware of Afghan robbers in the neighbourhood of Sherabad, and of fever and ague in the country extending from the mountains to the Oxus. They made a detour by Khuzar and Sherabad, and subsequently penetrated as far as Kurgan Tiube (or Tepe), a fortified town on the Surkhab or Waksh river. The unhealthiness of the country prevented them from carrying out their intention of advancing to the junction of this river with the Ab-i-Panja. They reached Chaar on their return journey on the llth-23rd June. Their inquiries added considerably to the knowledge ot Hissar, which is composed of nine Begships,—Baisun, Deh-i-nau, Yurcha, Hissar, Baljuan, Kolab, Kurgan Tiube, Kobadian, and Sherabad. The five first-named are included in the Russian Samarkand District, and the other four belong to the Oxus valley, which, for a distance of about 130 miles, forms the southern limit of Bokhara. The Begship of Baljuan is conterminous on the east with Darwaz; and Kolab on the south-east adjoins Badakshan. The rivers Surkhab or Waksh, Kafirnihan, Surhan, and Sherabad Darya, afford abundant irrigation to the valleys in Hissar, which is consequently tolerably populous. On account, however, of the intersecting mountain ranges there are no roads practicable for wheeled carriages. The Gazette adds that on the strength of the geographical data obtained by this expedition, it will be now possible to draw up a sufficiently detailed map of the hitherto unknown regions of Hissar and Kolab.

Deputation of tlie Ameer’s son to St. Petersburg. —The Bokharian Embassy, headed by the Ameer’s son, Sayud Mahomed Nazir-udin Khan, aged about 17, left Tashkend on the 4th July 1876 in charge of Colonel Tereikofski. Nazir-udin had been admitted by the Emperor into the Corps de Pages at St. Petersburg, but when it was found that he was married and had a family of children, his brother Sayud Mansur Khan, aged 10, was substituted for him. As the elder Prince had reached Tashkend before the arrangement was altered, the Ameer desired that he should continue his journey and pay his respects to the Emperor. Abdul Malik Tura, the eldest son of the Ameer of Bokhara, who is in exile and has gone to Mecca on a pilgrimage, declared that the ahoyenamed princes had really been sent to St. Petersburg to be kept under surveillance on account of their enmity with their father. The following is an account of their reception by the Emperor on the 13th November:— “ The Embassy was conducted to the Winter Palace in two gala carriages, being accom panied by Colonel Davydof, and Mirza Hazem Beg Abedinof (Dragoman to the Minister for Foreign Affairs), who are attached to the Embassy during its stay at St. Petersburg, and also by Colonel Tereikofski and Lieutenant Kulchonof, who have accompanied it from Tashkend. The Embassy was received in the f White Room’ by Mr. Grote, Grand Marshal of the Court, and by Prince Lieven, Grand Master of the Ceremonies, where an entertainment was given at 1 o’clock. It was thereupon conducted to the room known as the ‘ Golden Hall’ or f Salle Doree,’ where it had the honor of being presented to His Majesty the Emperor, to whom Mahomed Nazir-udin, elder son of the Ameer, addressed the following words: — “ f My father and sovereign, the Ameer of Bokhara, has charged me to lay at the feet of Your Majesty his compliments, the expression of his devotedness, and his congratulations at the reconciliation of Ferghana with Russia. Grant also, Sire, that I may, at the request of the Ameer, present to the benevolent solicitude of Your Imperial Majesty my young brother Mir Mansur, who, with the permission of Your Majesty, will remain here to study. I cannot be but grateful towards the destiny which has accorded to me, one so young, the intense joy of seeing the powerful and magnanimous Sovereign.’ “ After having listened to this discourse with benevolence, the Emperor charged Sayud Nazir-udin to express to the Ameer his satisfaction with the amicable relations which actually existed between Russia and Bokhara, and his determination to entertain these relations. “ Toksaba Mirza Issam Eddin spoke then in these terms :— Sire, it is not the first time that the sons of the Ameer are in your capital. But by order of my sovereign, I have the honor of calling the very gracious attention of Your Imperial Majesty to the particular character of our actual mission. In sending his beloved son to study here, the Ameer has wished to give Your Imperial Majesty and the whole world an unexceptionable testimony of his respect for, and his confidence in, a great monarch and Russia, and their mutual friendship will there find a pledge, and the Omnipotent and All- powerful will accord years of long life and happiness to you and your sons.’ “ In reply, His Majesty expressed satisfaction at the arrival of the sons of the Ameer, adding, that he in truth saw in this mission a proof of the confidence of the Ameer and of his deference to Russia, and concluded by expressing hopes that ^after completing his education, Sayud Mir Mansur would render great service to his country.” [Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated mh-mh June 1876.] [Turkestan Gazette, No. 24, dated %Znd June-Mh July 1876.] [Turlestan Gazette, No. 20, dated \§tA-'-\\st August 1876.] [Journal de St. Petersbourg, dated 14-26/^ December 1876.]172 Mr. N. Strembukhofs opinion of the feelings of the AmoQvVvf Bokhara—Mr. N. Stremoukhof is the son of the thief of tlie ishk Deportment of the Russian Foreign Office. _ When the Bokhara Embassy of 1873 returned in May 1871 to Bokbaia, Mr. Stiemoukhof aceom- uanied it The following extract taken from his diary throws light on the real feelings of the Ameer towards Russia and on the intercourse between Bokhara and Cabul:— «Towards the close of the year 1873, Ameer Sayud Muzaffar-Eddin of Bokhara des- Hatched an Embassy to St. Petersburg, which returned to Pashkend on its way back to Bokhara in Mav 1871 The visit to the Russian capital, and the gracious reception which was accorded to the mission, produced a great effect on the uncivilized Bokhanots According to their own words, they beheld marvels which it was impossible to imagine ibis meed of in-aise to European culture was the more astonishing, because it was one of the very few en comiums which Central Asiatics have allowed themselves to pass in public and without restraint. What makes this more remarkable is that no Central Asiatic has ever yet had the temerity to o-o into ecstacies over anything that was not of the Mussulman world, for fear of that universal abhorrence and of those heavy punishments, which have invariably had the effect of moderating the admiration for European culture which Mussulmans have sometimes ventured to express * “ The Bokhara Embassy was returning with numerous presents from the Emperor to the Ameer On its arrival at Tashkend, I was commissioned, as a mark of honour, to accompany it to Bokhara, being at the same time instructed to convey to Sayud Muzaffar expressions of good will on the part of the Governor-General of Turkestan, and of Lieutenant-General Kolpakofski. 1 cannot say that the intelligence of my appointment .produced a favourable impression on the Bokhara Envoy. He feared lest he should fall into disgrace with his master for bringing with him a kaffir. Abdul-Kadyr-Bai (the envoy in question) could not conceal Ins chagrin, notwithstanding all the blandishments which he lavished upon me on our first introduction to each other. ' Being well acquainted with his master’s vacillating and ferocious nature, he was particularly appreheiisive as to the manner in which I should be received in Bokhara, and as to the light in which His Eminence the Ameer would view his proceedings at St. Petersburg. My presence was calculated to hamper the Envoy very considerably.” tf During mv stay at Kitab, a courier from General Abramof was also there, but Bokhariots did not allow him to see me,t and there was also an envoy from Shir Ali, Ruler of Cabul. The latter attended the Ameer of Bokhara on all his excursions.” the the “The relations of Bokhara, or, more properly speaking, of the Ameer of Bokhara, with Afghanistan and Russia, are subject to frequent variation, and entirely depend on the attitude of menace assumed by either. Muzaffar inclines to the side which threatens most. It w r eie great folly to rely upon him. He is at any time ready either to become a zealous friend or an inveterate foe. This vacillating policy is a natural consequence of the position of affairs. It is easy to observe during a short stay in Bokhara how weak are the foundations both of the authority of the Ameer and of his relations with his neighbours. Owing to his cruel and disorderly government, Sayud Muzaffar cannot reckon on the sympathies and fidelity of his subjects, and the knowledge of this necessarily obliges him to he in constant fear; he can never vouch for the security of his power, his riches, or even of his life. So long as his sub jects continue with apathy to bear the tyranny which oppresses them, so long wall the Ameer be able to exercise his rule ; but he will inevitably be lost if the dread of him should cease. Having no firm ground under his feet in his own dominions, the Ameer does not calculate on the support of his neighbours. He is, therefore, obliged to have continual recourse to intrigue, fraud, and cunning, and to steer between the obstacles and dangers which beset him, and his sympathies incline towards the party yielding the stronger influence. “ The ill-will and enmity entertained towards us by the Afghans, have long been known to us. Instigated thereto probably by the English, the Afghans unceasingly endeavour to set the Ameer of Bokhara against us, and to urge him to open hostilities. These persistent demands are backed by various menaces; not having yet experienced the power of the Russian arms they rely on the valour of their troops (it must be allowed that they are tolerably well organized), and constantly frighten the Ameer of Bokhara with the declaration that if he declines to ally himself with them, they will invade his territory. The Afghans who were in Bokhara during my stay in that city, repeated this several times to Mullah Aunusof (taking him for a Bokhariot, and never suspecting .him to be my companion), adding,— f our troops can * “The mission of Tura-Jan, the late son of the Ameer, in 1869, affords a striking example; the fruits of this embassy are almost completely lost.” f “ Stremoukhof did see him in Bokhara, where S. himself collected evidence for General Abramof, regarding the settlement of some protracted legal case, at which the Ameer was offended.”always defeat the Russians The cowardly Muzaffar was very often quite prepared to cede to the Afghan requests, and willing to declare himself an enemy of Russia. So even recently duW the Khivan Campaign, the Ameer, advised by the Afghans, very nearly refused point-blank to send out supplies of provisions to the detachment which left Tashkend for Khiva • if he had done so, our troops would have been placed in a very embarrassing position. He intended at the same time, to give passage through his dominions to Afghan troops, with whom he would have made an attack on Samarkand. But a Tartar named Karatayef,* resident in Bokhara and the leading Bokhara merchants, presented themselves before the Ameer, and persuaded him to preserve the peace towards Russia, showing him the dangers in which inimical proceeding’s would involve both him and the country. These arguments overcame the irresolution of the Ameer, and the Afghans departed without having attained any of their objects. “ An Afghan Embassy appears every year in Bokhara with some new propositions, and with fresh menaces. I arrived in Bokhara at the time when such an Embassy was travelling about with the Ameer; but this time also the Afghans were unsuccessful. I ascertained that they had come to insist again on a passage for their troops through Bokhara, and that they were trying to persuade the Ameer not to give me the brilliant reception which was in pre paration for me. They failed even in this object. Muzaifar was very much pleased at the honor done him by the White Czar, and determined therefore, as it appears to me, to declare himself openly a friend to Russia. The Afghans were consequently received with coldness; they were not admitted to (the) audiences; the presents given to them, and their allowance, were poor and meagre; they were not allowed to ride about the town, and a host of spies followed all their movements. “The Ameer of Bokhara has now apparently come to his senses, and has realized the value and advantage of the friendship of Russia, by appealing to which he may strengthen his position. He is now doing all he can to display to us his friendship and devotion. Whether his intentions are sincere, and whether he will adhere to this policy, are questions upon which it is impossible as yet to arrive at a conclusion.^ [Michell’s Abstract XIII, 1875.] 173. Brief account of Meer Syud Abdool Malik— Abdool Malik is the eldest son of the Ameer of Bokhara. He is about 27 years of age, and was described in 1869 as a well-looking, quiet, intelligent lad, of middle size, weak constitution, and with small-pox marks on bis face. In 1868 he endeavoured to raise a religious war, in opposition to the wishes of his father, against the Russians. He persuaded the people of Karshi, Sherabad, Shuhr-i-Subz, Koolab, and Hissar, &amp;c., to join him. For a time he was successful, but eventually the Ameer, aided by the Russians, drove him out of the country. He fled to Shuhr-i-Subz, thence to Samarkand, Khiva, Charjoee, and eventually in August 1869 to Cabul, where he was received with honor. The Ameer held a Durbar for his reception, a salute of 21 guns was fired, and the guard of honor presented arms. In due course the Ameer returned his visit, a monthly allowance of Rupees 4,000 w r as granted him, besides house furniture to the value of Rupees 12,000. But when the Meer of Koolab, Surrah Beg, wrote to Abdool Malik, urging him, in co-operation with the Ameer of Cabul, to attack Bokhara from the direction of Kirkee and Charjoee, Shere Ali declined to assist him and advised him to remain quiet in Cabul. Abdool Malik then begged for leave to reside in Afghan Turkestan, which the Ameer refused on the ground that his residence so near the Bokhara frontier would probably disturb the peace and compromise Cabul. The Ameer also declined to permit him to proceed to Koolab and Shuhr-i-Subz, and wrote to Naib Mahomed Alum Khan to inform the Meer of Kirkee that the Prince had desired to leave Cabul, but had been detained there for the sake of the peace of Bokhara. At last Abdool Malik determined on flight. On the Ameer becoming aware of this intention he sent to inform the Prince that if he consented to remain in Cabul, he would continue to receive hospitable treatment, or, in the event of his being desirous to leave, he would be escorted as far as the Oxus, but would not be permitted again to seek shelter in * “Karatayef and the Kushbegi are the leaders of the Eussian party in Bokhara, where Karatayef is known ty the name of Usta-Ali, and is the Court clock-maker.”Afghanistan The Prince having expressed his desire to leave Cabul, started for Turkestan on the 17th October 1869, and crossing the Oxus on the 1st November, shortly afterwards took refuge in Kashgar. He remained in Kashgar under a sort of surveillance till July 1876, when Mr R B. Shaw wrote demi-officially to Major Henderson, saying that Abdool Malik was on his way to India ostensibly en route for Mecca, and that he proposed giving the Prince some slight pecuniary aid. The Government of India thereupon issued the following ordeis . a Considering 1 the high rank of the Bokharian Prince, His Excellency thinks that if he nroceeds to Srinuo-gur or British India, he should be civilly received, and in the event of his bein- in want that the necessities of himself and his followers should be relieved: but the political antecedents of the Prince and his present position render it advisable that the courtesy Lnwn him should be unaccompanied by any ostentation. d the Prince is really going to Mecca and is without funds, the Government of India will be prepared to send him to Bombay and arrange for procuring him a passage on some native passenger vessel, but in any case, whether he goes to Mecca or seems disposed to stay in India, the Viceroy is of opinion that the British authorities ought to keep a watchful eye on his movements and proceedings.^ On his arrival at Bombay, Abdool Malik asked for a passage for himself, his family and followers to Jeddah, which was provided, and during his stay in Lahore and Bombay he was granted an allowance of Rupees 12 per diem. After havhm visited Medina, he found his way to Constantinople. The following extract regarding him is taken from the Itusski Jklir, dated 15th March 1877, is given :— « Abdool Malik, the eldest son of the Ameer of Bokhara, known throughout Central Asia by the appellation of Katta-Tiuria, and who has, up to recently, lived in Kashgar, left that * The same who two years ago was at St. Peters- place a few months ago for Constantinople in burg, and before that in Calcutta. company with Mahomed Yakoob Khan* despatched by the ruler of Djetyshar on a mission to the Sultan. «This circumstance, taken in conjunction with the Katta-Tiuria’s individual character, his roving life, his relations with the Central Asian rulers, but principally with his animosity to his father, may be a matter of great significance in Central Asia, especially if the present com plications in the East (of Europe) be not amicably settled. ***^**** The wandering and adventurous life, the activity of the Katta-Tiuria, his acquaintance with all the prominent people in Central Asia, and his detestation of ‘ Kafirs' or ‘ Giaours/ have made him the centre of general attraction and the representative of Mahomedan independence. The great mass of his adherents, scattered over the various parts of Central f Is stated at the beginning of the precis he is Asia, watch the fate of this young man, now 2df about 27 years of age. years of age, with a keen interest. “ Should Turkey of England, in the event or a confusion in the affairs of the East, choose to avail herself of his services, it may be safely said that the bold adventurer would willingly place himself at her disposal, in order to try his luck once more in opposition to his father.' Mr. A. H. Layard, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, in a pri vate letter dated 27th June 1877, to His Excellency the Viceroy, said that the Sultan had heard, through some of the Bokhara people in Stamboul, that arrangements were being made at Bokhara for its occupation by the Russians, whose arrival was looked for in a few months. The Sultan wished to know whether this was true, having some idea of sending Abdool Malik, with arms and money, to get up a movement in that quarter against Russia. In a letter of 6th September 1876, from Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran to the Earl of Derby, Mr. Taylour Thomson reported a rumoured rising in Bokhara against the Russians, and added that he had been informed by the Persian Minister that Abdool Malik had requested permission to proceed from Constantinople through Persia to Merv. His object was to await there a favorable opportunity for getting up a movement against Russia amongst the party in Bokhara who, like himself, considered that his father had shown culpable weakness in not continuing the war writh the Czar.On 22nd September 1877 Mr. Layard reported by telegraph that Abdool Malik had left Constantinople for Bombay, and that he had declined to give him letters. He added that the Grand Vizier had told him that he looked upon Abdool Malik as an adventurer, and that the Porte had nothing to do with his schemes. On Abdool Malik’s arrival at Bombay on 10th December the Government of Bombay were told that he should not be treated as a guest, and that proper precautions should be taken to have his movements watched. On the 19th December 1877, the Government of Bombay forwarded for orders two letters from Abdool Malik, in which he asked that he might be shown the same courtesy as had been shown to him in Bombay on the previous occasion. He said that after his arrival at Lahore he intended to wait upon His Excellency the Viceroy to make a personal representation to him on a certain important matter. These letters were acknowledged. On the 2nd January 1878 the Government of Bombay reported that Abdool Malik was still there, and proposed, at the instance of the police, to induce him to leave before the Moharrum, which proposal was approved. Abdool Malik having also reported his arrival at Bombay to the Punjab Government, instructions were given not to treat him as guest. If he came to the Punjab, he was to be quietly watched. On the 10th January 1878 the Government of Bombay reported that it had been reliably ascertained that Abdool Malik could not leave Bombay for want of funds, and asked if the Government of India would authorise pay ment of his passage by rail, and that of his family to Lahore, with a present of Rupees 100. The Bombay Government were, however, told in reply that the Prince’s presence at Lahore would be more inconvenient than at Bombay. It was suggested that he might be sent to Bushire, and then allowed to find his way through Persia. Abdool Malik, however, declined to return to Bokhara via Bushire on the ground of enmity between the Persians and his countrymen. . -vr _ , . ^ He has since been told again that* the Government of India were willing to provide him with a free passage from Bombay to Bushire, and that if he decided not to avail himself of this offer, no other assistance could be given him.( 261 ) 175. Progress and population of Tashkend. —The Russian quarter of this town, says the Journal de St. Jetersbourg, is increasing rapidly. The Boulevard Yorontsof has replaced the old mud walk of the citadel. The limits of the town are constantly being enlarged by new buildings. Land, which scarcely fetched 20 copecks per Russian square fathom [49 English square feet],*' now costs 50 copecks. The price of land in the vicinity is also rising. Rice land now fetches 112 or 111 rouble per desiatinaj and pasture land still more. The price of a desiatina of plough land is 10 to 60 roubles. Prom a census taken in 1875 it appears that the population of the Russian town, exclusive of the troops and itinerant merchants, amounted to 1,859 souls. Compared with the results (2,073) of the census of 1871, these figures show that the Russian population has more than doubled in four years.'

Telegraph communication in Turkestan— It was hoped that during 1876-77 telegraph communication between the undermentioned places might be completed— Khojend—Kokand. K ho jend—Oratippe—S amark and. Tashkend—Perofsk. Verny—Altyn-Emelsk—Kulja. The construction of a line from Kazalinsk to Perofsk would then complete the Turkestan system of telegraph lines, of which Tashkend forms the centre. [Turkestan Gazette, No. 31, dated 10^-22^7 August 1876.] 177. Emigration from Russia to Turkestan.— The Russian jovernment long ago recognized the necessity of colonizing Turkestan. At first ntending emigrants were encouraged to resort to the Semirechye, parts oi which ire now said to resemble Southern Russia. Subsequently, m 1871, endeavours vere made to induce people to accept land in the drstnct of ^ Auh Ata m e $yr Darya Province, but without much success. It is only in the district o [ssyk-Kul that colonization has really taken root, and where consider ab e tillages, already very prosperous, have been established. One inducement has b.L the beUrf that the colonists would be exempt from military service. But it has now been settled that the term of militai y servi kestan shall extend over nine years—seven m active service, and two m reserve 178. SUver Currency in Turkestan— The coinage and currency of Turkestan have been taken fiom the Turkestm. “Hitherto the branch offices of the Russian Exchequer aecepted^ver m shape of coin of the Native States as well as in . sl)|ir ,,, . ul ,i the Governor-General i per pound, which the Financial Secretary of Sta e a . t, ^ ^ m oney market in urkestan have from time to time regulated accor mg ^ kinds of native coin have )pe.

The following considerations will leave no doubt on this point: ■ “ 1 Native silver coin will disappear from circulation or find its way to the neighbouring Khanates for two reasons : in the first place, on account of such a depreciation being confined to Turkestan: secondly, because the kokans, though accepted m payment of taxes by the Government, cannot be changed for bank-note* {'paper currency) W hat then are the people to do with a practically useless capital of kokans (containing silver of 92 *) m Turkestan? They can evidently do nothing with them till they find a market m which kokam are current- in other words, they must export them, and Turkestan will be deprived of a great amount of hard cash until these coins regain their former value. « g Without coin and some sort of small change neither the trade with our Asiatic neigh bours nor the daily petty transactions in the bazaars are possible; consequently we shall be compelled'to import cash and small change from European Russia when the kokam will have disappeared. Judging from the deposits in our Government branch exchequers, the sum neces sary for the above purposes will amount to from one to two millions of silver roubles. (C 3. The depreciation of the kokan from 20 to 16 or 17 copecks, i.6., at the late of 15 to 20 per cent may easily evoke reprisal on our financiers from the Khans, in which event it is by no means impossible that our paper rouble might lose 15 and even 20 per cent, of the present value (100 roubles in paper are equal to 110 roubles worth of silver in the Khanates).! “ 4 Indirectly the same will happen within Turkestan, i.e. y nominally the paper rouble will remain unchanged, but we will get less for it in the market, the Government will pay 1,200 roubles for a piece of contract work which now costs a thousand only, and so forth. * * * “ The kokam which circulate within Turkestan represent an amount of 1,500,000 roubles. By depreciating their value from 20 to 17 copecks (15 per cent.) the Government gains ... and on the other hand loses on 35 millions of paper roubles; J consequently the transac tion results in a nett loss of to the State. Should the depreciation of the kokans be carried further, say to 16 copecks or 20 per cent., the result will be: gain as above . Loss as above . Nett loss to Government as above . 225,000 roubles, 5,250,000 5,025,000 300,000 7 , 000,000 6,700,000 “ In this manner their depreciation is sure to be followed by a loss of from 5 millions to 6,700,000 roubles to the State; on the other hand, the Government at present makes a nett profit of 10 per cent, on every paper rouble exchanged for kokam [5 (15—13) = 10 per cent.] Hence the measure of depreciating the native coin of Central Asia is clearly unprofitable from a business point of view. Under the conditions which have existed in Turkestan since we occupied the country, Russia has drawn a million of roubles worth of fine silver from Asia, for which she has only returned 600,000 roubles worth of small change ;§ on the first of September 1875 the cash deposits in the provincial exchequer of Tashkend amounted to 387,833 Russian silver roubles and 617,459 roubles in kokans or to 1,005,292 roubles in all; then why should a system be changed which has hitherto led to such favorable results to the State! “ During the same period that Russia was thus drawing native silver from Central Asia, England has been exporting it from Europe to India at the rate of more than a hundred millions roubles worth per annum.|| Moreover our bank-notes form de facto the favorite currency not only in Turkestan, but even in the neighbouring Khanates, which thus entirely depend on Russia from a financial point of view. This very favorable result is chiefly owing to the promptness and strict integrity witb which our administration has always fulfilled its promises and obligations; thanks to the unlimited credit which our Regime enjoys in consequence, we can not only dispense with bullion from Russia, but the State and our merchants gain 10 per cent. (10 copecks) on every paper rouble.

Eugene Schuyler’s Renort on Turkestam-At the end of 1874 Mr Schuyler, haying returned from a tour in Central Asia, acldiessecl a despateli to his Government on the condition of Turkes tan and on Geneial Ivan Ifni aim s expedition to Khiva. Its publication °Teatlv an noyed the military party, and General Eenitz undertook to refute the accusations levelled against General Kauffmann. His argument was replied to in the following article from the Russia Mir, which paper was immediately suspended for three months. The Russki Mir is the journal of the party opposed to General Miliutin, Minister of War:— “General Henitz states that he considers himself a competent juchm of Turkestan affairs, inasmuch as he was one of the chief members of the Commission which projected the regulations for the administration of the Kirghiz Steppe and of the territory newly acquired from Kokand, and that he subsequently became chief of General Kauffmamhs Chancery, and held that post for two years. This Commission evoked a general rising of the Orenburg Kirghiz, while in Turkestan that chaos and official tyranny were inaugurated which have been so faithfully portrayed by Mr. Schuyler in his happy grouping of the most prominent facts. It would, therefore, seem that the arguments brought forward by General Henitz do not give him the slightest claim to final adjudication in this matter, but sooner relegate him to a place in the ranks of the Turkestan officials, who appear before public opinion not in the capacity of judges, but of course in that of the accused. The latter place belongs to General Henitz more especially, because he, as chief of the Chancery, was one of the principal actors in the introduction of the famous regulations, and that owing to his position he could not but exercise influence over the selection of officials. We know for a fact that the three district administrators whose malpractices are described by Mr. Schuyler were appointed on General Henitzh recommendation. He further observes that he does not belong to any of the parties into which all those who have a knowledge of Central Asia have become divided. To this we shall reply that the parties only exist in his own imagination, and that in point of fact there are only two sides in the matter: Russian public opinion has long been alarmed by everything that takes place in Turkestan, while the Turkestan officials endeavour to conceal their proceedings and to maintain the status quo which is so lucrative for them. As far as Russian public opinion is concerned, it is perfectly indifferent as to who the adminis trator of Turkestan may be, whether this or that official; it only requires to know whether the reports in circulation, no matter through what channel they may have gained notoriety, are well founded, and if so, it is anxious that moral retribution should visit the offenders. Thus, for instance, it would be desirable to ascertain— “1. Is it true that the Commander of the Kuraminsk District dissipated considerable sums entrusted to him; and if true, how large were these sums, from what source were they replaced, and what punishment did the offender receive ? “ 2. Is it true that the District Commander of Perofsk extorted the consent of the inhabit ants to forego their claims against the Russian Government for the camels which died during the Khiva expedition ? Public opinion is outraged by this act, which places our G overnment in the eyes of the Natives on a level with that of Khiva, Bokhara, Kokand, &amp;c. “ 3. Is it true that Captain Ehmann, Commander of a Company of Rifles, reported that he was robbed of the sum of 5,787 roubles and 44 copecks belonging to Government at Useke while marching to Kuldja, and that Baron Grevenitz, Judge of the first Yernoe District, was appointed to investigate the matter ? Is it true that Baron Grevenitz on reaching Boroqusirisk station, in the district of Kopal, subjected twelve men to torture ? “ 4. Is it true that Captain Ehmann, troubled by pangs of conscience, committed suicide, leaving a letter to the effect that he had himself squandered the. Government money,^ thus proving the innocence of the men who had acknowledged their guilt under torture? (These facts, it is said, were also confirmed by the enquiries of a new Commission under the presidency of Colonel Uzof.) “ 5. Is it true that Baron Grevenitz escaped without any punishment, and that he was only subsequently transferred in his former capacity to Fort Perofsk ? “We shall not put any more questions grounded on Mr. Schuyler’s report, but we may observe that no answers on the part of the Turkestan administration will appease public opimon, which can only be pacified by the appointment of some persons, independent or t ie loca authorities and enjoying general confidence, for the purpose of investigating rose ai T ee s on the spot and adopting the necessary preventive measures. &lt;f In all these circumstances we are equally astounded by the abuses of the officials appointed to civilize the Asiatics, and the impunity of these malpractices, as we as &gt;\ - ic i ca mess ^ ^ which the person who once occupied a prominent position, openly praises ic oca an oil ics such impunity. We are confounded by the dissonance which exists between the laudable inten tions of the Government and the reduction of these intentions to pine ice y i s a^cn s, yorant of self-sovemment in principle, and the swarming mass of officials who prevent the realiza- f ; ‘ ,,, tlli „ “mciole ■ bv the separation of the Courts of Law from the administration, and the ti°n oi tlus P nncl P' e - ™ e P infliction of torture by the Judge himself; by the (Note. — This is not very clear, but is accurately jjragsclg Conference for agguaging the rigours of copied from the Foreign Office document.) ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ Commander to degtroy the families of the conquered Turkomans for their unpunctual payment of 300,000 nl OG u It is desirable to despatch unprejudiced persons to Turkestan, for the purpose of elucidat ing many other questions, as for instance “ 1 How far the yearly expenditure of Russian wealth is necessary for the dissemination of European civilization among the Kirghiz and Sarts through the medium of officials, when millions of native Russians remain in abject poverty, and subsist all the year round on nothing but bread mixed with husks and the bark of trees ? “ 2. Whether there is any possibility to reduce the number of troops and officials, and by simplifying the administration to curtail the expenditure ? “ 3. Whether the productiveness of the border Cossack settlements is not impoverished by the inordinate drafting of Cossacks for service in the Turkestan Region ? “4. Is there any necessity for the existing costly surroundings of the Governor-General, and whether, since the establishment of a line of telegraph, it is at all necessary that he should enjoy the unlimited power he now possesses ? These questions are apt to strike every one, especially seeing that out of the seven years that have elapsed since the establishment of the Governor-Generalship, General Kauffmann with his numerous suite of assistants has passed two years and a half at St. Petersburg. “5. Is it necessary to retain the system of f extraordinary outlays/ and the exchange of presents with the neighbouring Khanates, particularly as such presents, according to report, have reached such a magnitude that they no longer resemble an interchange of civilities ? “6. It would be advisable to investigate locally why the expenditure in the region is constantly increasing, while the local revenue is yearly diminishing; and whether the latter circumstance is attributable to the exhaustion of the tax-paying capabilities of the population, or to the growing appetite of the Turkestan officials. “7. In order to determine the extent of the productiveness of the outlay made by the Russian Government in the Turkestan Region, it would be useful to ascertain in what manner the sum of 2,400,000 roubles, belonging to the Zarafshan revenues and placed at the complete disposal of the Governor-General, has been dealt with. [The article concludes by strongly urging the Government to order a careful revision and inspection of the whole system of administration now in force in Turkestan, and promises to indicate in a future article the way and the manner in which Russia can extricate herself from the morally and materially embarrassing position in which she has been placed m Turkestan for the last ten years.] The Moscow Gazette and the Golos also noticed Mr. Schuyler’s despatch. The former, in its issue of the 19th Eebruary (2nd March) 1875, contained a leading article on the subject of Mr. Schuyler’s despatch on the. Khivan Expe dition. It described this official document as having no serious import, and as being a vhqyq feuilleton. Many of the incidents reported were condemned as bazaar reports and improbable in themselves. The alleged malpractices of Hussian officers were characterized as scandals. It defended the operations of the Russian troops during the Khiva campaign, which was most ably con ducted in spite of great difficulties and danger. The brilliant results attained were due, not only to the heroism of the troops, hut also to their efficient organization and to good generalship. [Secret, May 1875, Nos. 50-51.] 180. Traction engines in Central Asia.— It appears from a report from Mr. Gastrell, Her Majesty’s Representative at Buda-Pesth, dated 19th April 1876, that the use of traction engines in Central Asia has been advocated by Russian military authorities. The difficulties in the way are scarcity of fuel and want of proper roads. “ For any routes starting from the Caspian Sea, naptha and petroleum could be (sakaul) brought from the southern end of that lake, and in the district from the north and east shores of the Caspian to the district of the Aral Sea the curious root f sachzul' (saxaul) would still be found, although more scarce than when it was used for the steamers on the lakes before coals had been discovered to the north of the Aral.THg usg of tiaction Gns'inos would bo to oonnppt flio at t? 1 e ji /-n, . ctzzi ril— “ 5 - tnu Stjz » 'In the plains the shifting brittle sand afoot nor! * Loir ,, „ obstacle.

Pressel, an Austrian Engineer, previously in tlie service of the Porte, prepared a scheme for a railway from Julfa to Bunder Ahbass, or other port, in the Persian Gulf. He engaged, \stly, to have the requisite surveys and plans of all works ex ecuted hy competent Engineers at his own expense, after which he proposed to forma Company and make an off er of terms; 2«c%, that if the terms of con struction proposed by him should prove to be as favorable for Persia as those, presented by any other Company, his should have a preference; and, Srdly, if they' should be less advantageous, that he should be indemnified for the preliminary expenses incurred by him. He hoped for the moral support of Hussia, Austria, and Germany, but kept his de-igns secret from the Turkish authorities. The Russian Government, however, declined encouragement, and the project fell through. [Secret, July 1875, Nos. 46-56.] 183. ThG Hussains at Asliourada. —The precarious position occu pied by the Russians at Ashourada, and their notorious anxiety to secure a more permanent footing, gave credence to their supposed intention to transfer their maritime station to some place on the mainland. Mr. Churchill, British Consul at Resht, reported that the rumour had no foundation in fact. In order to note the shifting of the silt in the neighbourhood of Ashourada the Russians had driven posts into the sand near the water-mark. It was concluded that the posts were intended to mark the site of a new. station, and it was said that a flag-staff had been erected on the Mian Kali Peninsula. In May 1875 Mr. Churchill wrote— “ On this information reaching Teheran, the Shah’s Government decided on forestalling the Russians by the erection of a fort on the extreme point of the Mian Kali Peninsula, and already materials have been secured to that effect. The fort, however, is to be called a shooting-box, and the existence of quantities of large game on the narrow strip which separates the lagoon from the sea serves as a plea to this decision.“In consequence of the recent encroachments of the sea on the Island of Ashourada, the place has become almost uninhabitable^ but in the natural course of events Ashourada will ultimately form a part of the mainland by the gradual deposit of sand and mud formed by the back-water of the lagoon south of the island. If the Persians, therefore, wish to limit the spot occupied by the Russians, they will do well to mark out by a fort a line beyond which their neighbours shall not pass, when A-shourada becomes a pi elongation of the Mian Kali Peninsula.” [ Secret, September 1875, Nos. 87-89.] 184, Russian opposition to the introduction of Persian vessels in the Caspian —In May 1876 Mr. Churchill reported the following circumstance, which illustrates the jealousy with which the hussian authorities yiew any attempt to employ Persian steam vessels on the Caspian. It appeared that passengers and goods were transported across the Murd-ab in flat-bottomed boats at a great loss of time. The Governor of Ghilan desired to improve this arrangement and ordered from Astrakhan a steam launch through Meer Jevad Khan, a Russian subject. When the boat reached Enzelee it was claimed by Meer Jevad Khan’s brother, who happened to be the Persian Duya Begee. This led the Russian Consul to suspect that the boat had been ordered for the Persian Government, and he directed its immediate sequestration. The Governor of Ghilan resented this uncalled for interference, and pro posed to the Teheran Government to purchase several steam launches in England, to be conveyed in pieces through the Caucasus, but there were difficulties in the way not likely to be overcome. Further, in order to prevent Persia from having any mercantile marine in the Caspian, the Russians have prohibited the exportation from their ports on this sea of timber and all other materials used in the construction of shipping. [Secret, August 1876, Nos. 47-49.] 185. Purchase of arms by the Persian Government— In November 1876, Jehangir Khan, an Armenian, Adjutant-General of the Persian army, was deputed to Europe to buy arms for the Persian Government. He was to get 40 Krupp 6-pounder guns, 30,000 Remington rifles with cartridges, and a number of Colt’s revolvers. The Persian Government were prepared to spend 300,000 tomans, but an attempt was to be made to allow the money to he paid by instalments. In December 1876 the Persian Government received 300 boxes of car tridges, being a further consignment of ammunition of the 30,000 captured Snider rifles which had been purchased from the German Government. It was said that the cartridges did not contain a full charge, and had to be refilled at the Arsenal in Teheran. [ General, B., January 1877, No. 159.] [ Secret, April 1877, Nos. 3-7.] 186. Baron Reuter’s Railway projects in Persia.— In Febru ary 1877 Baron Reuter told Lord Derby that he still entertained a project for the construction of a Railway in Persia, from some point in the Persian Gulf to the interior, probably Ispahan. He was anxious that the British Government should guarantee the cost of construction. He was told that the Ministry would not propose any such thing, and that it was improbable that Parliament would sanction it, if they did. Baron Reuter talked of further projects, but met with little encouragement from Lord Derby.187. Military Cossack Colony between the Aral and Caspian Seas—An article on this subject appeared in the Turkestan Gazette, pointino* out that the position of the Aral-Caspian Region between the two seas further south than the most important Central Asian towns—Khiva, Bokhara Kokand Tashkend, Samarkand, &amp;c., together with the fact that it commanded the whole northern frontier of Persia, gave it a peculiar strategical importance. In this country, with its fine climate and extensive horse-breeding, the Cossacks could be of great service to Russia by co-operating towards the pacification of the Turkoman population, and by creating an Orthodox Christian commonwealth on the threshold of the East. It was the Cossacks who conquered Siberia for Russia. With Cossacks for their immediate neighbours the Turkomans would giadually and natuially he Russianized without ever becoming aware of it—by intermarriage—until eventually the whole tribe would he absorbed.* [Turkestan Gazette, No. 47, dated %§th November 1875, O.S.] 188. Statistics of the Oxus Province.— The Russian territory on the right hank of the Oxus between the Sea of Aral and Port Petro-Alexandrofsk is divided into two districts—Chimbai and Shourakhan.

Steam Navigation on the Oxus. —A detailed account of the exploration of the Oxus in 1874 by the expedition under Colonels Stoletof and Sobolef will he found in Appendix XIY of Mr. Henvey’s precis. In August 1876 a further attempt was made. The Steamer Terofski in 1874 had not proceeded beyond Port Petro-Alexandrofsk and had found much difficulty in stemming the current with engines of 40-horse power. On the 6th August Captain Brukhof started for that fort in the Steamer Samarkand taking with him two days’ fuel. About 43 miles from the fort the vessel was brought to for the night, ke., about 2^ miles below the point where the current had baffled the strength of her engines in the previous year. On the following day Brukhof succeeded in overcoming this difficult section of the river at a speed of about two miles per hour; higher up the steamer attained a speed of four miles per hour. At noon, when the supply of fuel was nearly exhausted,^ her head was turned back to Petro-Alexandrofsk, which she reached in the evening of the same day, attain ing a speed of some 16^ miles per hour on the return trip. * This theory is by no means Utopian, and has a precedent in the history of the Ural Cossacks who have mtirely absorbed a certain Kalmuk tribe, which originally came from the north-west of the present Chinese Empire.—See “ Sketches of the Semirechensk.” Translated by P. M., Calcutta, Foreign Department Press, 1-875, 28.On the strength of this trial trip, Captain Brukhof has come to the con- elusion that the Amu Darya can be permanently navigated as far as the Bussian territory reaches, viz., to Mashekli; all that is needful to this end is to provide a more powerful steamer than the $ctftiuvkafid, [Turkestan Gazette, No. 2, dated Wi-lWi January 1875.] [llussische Revue, Yol.

Expedition in June 1875 from Krasnovodsk to explore the ancient bed Of the OxusThe object of this expedition was to ascertain the possibility of diverting the Ox ns into the Caspian, into which it formerly flowed. The first exploration of the Uzboi or ancient bed of the Oxus was made by the Krasnovodsk detachment on the occasion of the expedition into the Trans-Caspian steppes, which preceded the Khiva campaign. One-third of the extent of the ancient bed had been several times traversed from the Caspian. The Krasnovodsk column, wdiich failed to reach Khiva, got as far as the Bala-Ishem wells, which are a little beyond Igdy. Between Igdy and Bala-Ishem the old bed of the river separates : one branch stretches away to the north of the Khanate of Khiva, to the salt lakes of Sary-Kamysh; and the other, turning to the south-east, skirts the Khiva oasis and rejoins the Oxus near Charjui in Bokhara. During the Khiva campaign, Colonel Glukhofski’s exploring party followed up the northern branch of the Uzboi from Kuna-Urganj to Sary-Kamysh. The salt lakes in this locality were reached by Colonel Marko- zofs detachment in the year 1871. That officer marched from Krasnovodsk up the Uzboi, but before reaching Igdy he turned to the north, and did not strike the ancient bed again until he arrived at Sary-Kamysh. From Krasnovodsk to Igdy the Uzboi w T as minutely surveyed, and a series of levels w r as taken. It was found that, through this extent of the old bed, there was a sufficient fall, and that, generally speaking, there was nothing to interfere with the passage of water from the main stream. Notwithstanding all the dams constructed by the Khivans, the water of the main river penetrated through side channels (aryks or canal) as far as Kuna-Urganj. Between this latter place and Sary-Kamysh there is nothing which is likely to prevent the re-estahlislnnent of the river’s course. According to reliable evidence, it still appears, when the Oxus is more than ordinarily high, that the stream flows into the Sary- Kamysh lakes. The only unexplored length of the ancient bed was the middle portion between Igdy, Bala-Ishem, and Sary-Kamysh. The expedition of 1875 was started with the object of exploring these portions and ascertaining whether it presented any peculiar difficulties. The following account of the proceedings of the expedition is taken from the JELussian Invalide :— “ As soon as all the detachment had assembled at the wells of Mulla-Kari, the troops advanced on the 8th of June by Tash-arvat-kala, Dzo-Yuruk, and Jamala. Three days later they entered the Uzboi, which presented the appearance of a well-defined channel of a large river. The road continually crossed mounds of sand 70 feet high, passing from one bank to the other. In the channel itself were numerous salt and fresh water lakes, and many wells, the water in which, however, was bitter and brackish, with a taste of sulphur. The marching over the scorching sands was difficult, but it was especially painful from the well of Arvat to Igdy, where for 4u miles not a drop of drinkable water was obtainable, that in the wells of Holmadji and Yanidji being so impure that guards had to be stationed to prevent the men from drinking it; besides which, the whole extent of 40 miles is one succession of sandhills, which towards Igdy are of considerable height. Nevertheless the men pressed bravely on. The equipment and supplies for the troops, regulated by the experience of previous campaigns, were all that could be desiied. I he camel transport was large in proportion to the size of the detachment; each company carried three days^ supply of water, and every soldier had his water-bottle or flask; they were all provided with sufficient meat, butter, dried cabbage, and different vegetables, and were obliged to drink tea morning and evening. Every possible precaution was taken to preserve the health of the men, as it was the hottest time of the year. The march and bivouac were conducted according to military regulations to provide against alarms, for it was doubtful how the lekke Turkomans would be disposed.“ On the 20th of June they arrived at Igdy, whence on the 22nd the Uzboi exploring party escorted by two companies, one gun, 1,000 Cossacks, and rocket battery, started from Bala-1 she m' They were further joined by 30 Turkoman Militia and other Native volunteers. Our explorers were the topographer Lupandin, an engineer, and a commercial agent. 1 “The detachment remained ten days at Igdy, making reconnaissances in the direction of Bala-Ishem, with the object of covering the explorers. The halt at Igdy in a sandy hollow was very trying, the heat being excessive—100 deg. Fahr. in the shade and 122 deg. in the sun; the wind raising clouds of hot sand and dust. Many of the men suffered from disorders of the stomach brought on by the impurity of the water, but without serious consequences. “The Khan of Khiva fulfilled his promise of sending 50 of his nukers (soldiers), com manded by the Beg of Urganj, to meet the exploring party at Sary-Kamysh. “ On receiving news of their satisfactory progress, the detachment left Igdy on the 1st of July on its return. The arid tract of 40 miles caused greater sufferings than before; for two consecutive days the men were exposed to a scorching heat and suffocating wind while march ing through burning sands. On arriving at Arvat, where there is a large fresh water lake, they were allowed two days' rest. On the 4th of July only eleven men, out of a total of 1,040, were reported ill; one soldier expired on the march, their route from Arvat to Dzo-yuruk led by the deep channel of the Uzboi, between sand banks forming a kind of trough, in which no breath of air was stirring, and the sufferings of the men became almost insupportable; towards evening marshy exhalations rose from the salt and fresh water lakes, which cover nearly the whole of this part of the Uzboi, and now and then after sultry heat a chilly wind would spring up. These sudden alternations of temperature increased the number of those suffering from bronchitis and inflammation of the lungs, and two men died. “ On the 11th of July the detachment issued from the Uzboi, on an elevated plain which lies at the foot of the Balkhan Hills, where they could breathe more freely. From Dzo-yuruk to Tash-arvat-kala it was not so exhausting, although even here the length of each march was eio-hteen to nineteen miles. After a day’s halt at the latter place they descended to Mulla-Kari, where fresh supplies awaited them, brought in the boats of the Krasnovodsk Station to Michailof Bay. “ The Uzboi explorers also returned safely direct^ to Krasnovodsk, having executed the task assigned to them. The whole extent of the Uzboi from Sary-Kamysh to the Caspian has been surveyed and mapped. During the advance to Igdy no inhabitants were seen, but deput ations of Tekkes frequently presented themselves to Major-General Lomakin. The first arrived at Igdy on the 22nd of J une, and consisted of several Tekke Khans, who came to tender their allegiance and submission, and to offer their services. More Turkomans joined the detachment on the return march at the well of Arvat on the 3rd and 4th of July, bunging for sale carpets, flour, and other provisions; sheep were also driven in, and a regular bazaar established. The impression produced by the march of our detachment into the heart of the country was favourable; tranquillity prevailed in the steppe; and 500 Persians freed from K hi van bondage returned home, passing through the Tekke oasis opposite Hek-tepeh. At Jamala a deputation of Akhal Tekke Turkomans, led by Mohamed Ali Kazi, accompanred by some more Khans and Elders, waited on the General. In this way Russian relations with the lekke tribe have gained a more friendly character, and more Turkomans now vrsrt Krasnovodsk than heretofore. Six have even gone to Baku.” The expedition did not fully explore the portion of the Uzboi between Charyshly and Sary-Kamysli, which is some twenty miles m eng i. u i was believed that no obstructions likely to have caused t e (iversion o ^ le river existed in this part. It was ascertained beyond doubt that the Uzboi, through its entire length of about 660 miles to the Caspian, is re o ^ bed of the river. The configuration and character of its ban vs ar e so \\e pre served that it is imposs ble to believe that so many as o ytais ^eeapse since the river flowed through it. The character ot t re groun , an of the hollow, contrast very singularly. with the surroundmg eountiy the immense lakes of fresh and salt water, with a depth m some o o 0rnP 110 t to eight fathoms, also attest to the flow of water through the TJzhoi at so ne very remote period. There are old Turkoman mha i an s o ) declare that the water from the Oxus flowed through the Uzboi as Lu as the Charyshly wells (200 miles) not more than 25 years ago. [Mickell’s Abstracts, Nos.

Discontent among the Kirghiz in Orenburg.— The follow. ing report, dated 5th July 1876, was received from Lord A. Loftus “ In the course of conversation the other day, M. de Giers told me that at the last Council of Ministers a report was read from the Governor of Orenburg in which he stated that a certain movement of discontent was visible among the Khirgbiz population in that district, who were Mussulmen, and that it appeared to bear a religious character and to indicate feelings of animosity towards the Christians. He said that he was watchful of this movement, and he advised that precautionary measures should be taken to prevent any sudden outbreak or manifestation. “ The Governor further stated that on investigating the causes of this movement, he had discovered that it had originated in Constantinople.^MExMORANDUM BY MR. HENVEY Otf THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GENERAL YON KAUFEMANN AND THE AMIR OF CABUL. [Referred to in paragraph 10 , Chapter /.] I. In March 1870, General Von Kauffmann* addressed to the Amir a letter in Russian * See Secret, Nos. 283-290, and English, and Persian. Its purport was to explain the circum- counected correspondence. stances under which Sirdar Abdul Rahman had been received by the authorities of Tashkend: to disclaim intention of meddling* with Afghanistan, not only because that country was under British protection, but also because the Amir showed no + •'&lt; Te ne desire nas de me diverter ^ n , of interferi ng with Bokhara; and to express friendship de + vous parceque votre efficacite n’a f or the Amir on the ground t that His Highness had given donne aucun sujet de meconteute- the writer no cause of dissatisfaction. It appeared from the meat. report of the Cabul Agent that the Amir was much troubled at the receipt of this communication, and very apprehensive of the object and meaning which the writer had in view. His Highness addressed Lord Mayo, and begged that the Russian letter might be translated into Persian, and that he might be advised as to the answer which should be returned. The opinion of the Foreign Department in this matter may be gathered from the follow ing remarks recorded by Mr. C. U. Aitchison, the Foreign Secretary, on the 2nd June 1870 :— “The letter...is a most insidious one, and in the reasons assigned for not meddling with the interior affairs of Afghanistan, there is an implication that any interference of Shere Ali in Bokhara would be ground for Russian interference in Afghanistan. “ The Amir might be thanked for referring this matter to us, and it might be suggested to him to send an answer generally to the effect that he is glad to receive the assurances of the Russian Governor-General that he will not interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, or give assistance and countenance to the enemies of the Amir; that the Amir has, in pursuance of the counsel and advice repeatedly given him by the British Government, repeatedly instructed his frontier officers to make no aggressions on their neighbours, or interfere in the political affairs of countries or tribes beyond the borders of Afghanistan; and that to this peaceful policy he is determined to adhere; and that, as he is guided, in this policy by the British Government who are allied with Russia on terms of the most cordial friendship, he thinks that it will he most convenient and tend most to obviate all 'Misunderstandings if General Kauffmann would in future mahe his views and wishes known to his Government at St. Petersburg for com munication to the Amir through the British Government, or something to that effect. ’ Lord Mayo, however, dissented from the above views in an important particular. In his Minute of 5th June 1870, His Lordship wrote:— “I cannot see anything so very insidious in this Russian letter: in fact, I think there is very little in it, and it was probably written in accordance with instructions received from St. Petersburg after Mr. Forsythes departure The letter may be drafted somewhat in the sense of the Secretary's suggestion. It must, how r ever, be pointed out in the letters that all our agreement with Russia is in the sense of non-extension, non-aggression, and non-mteifei- ence. That must be prominently put forward, for it is desirable that the Amir should be made fully aware that, should Russia assume at any time a more aggressive position than she does now, such an attitude would not be approved of by the British Government ■•••••.• I do not think it desirable that General Kauffmann should be invited by the Amir to make his wishes known to the Ruler of Afghanistan through his Government at St. Petersburg for commu nication by ns So far for General Kauffmann's letter, to which I do not attach any very great importance.' Accordingly, the Viceroy wrote to the Amir on the 24th June 1870, sending a coneet translation in English and Persian of the Russian letter, and informing His Highness ot the successful issue of the negotiations at St. Petersburg and of the. dec ara ions rna e y e Russian Government as to the peaceful character of their Central Asian po icy. is ig nes was also advised to send a reply in the sense of the tot part of 1 r ' ' ® ^ 0n 3 “° 24t , h correspondence was transmitted to the Secretary of State, with .despat. • &gt; June 1870, in which the Government of India stated their opinion that dated General 24th VonKauffmann^s communication had resulted from the instructions previously issued from St. Petersburg, namely, that General Von Kauffmann should make generally known in Central Asia the perfect understanding existing between Great Britain and Russia in respect to those countries. The Amir adopted the Viceroy's advice, and sent an answer in the terms recommended. It may also be observed that a copy of General Von Kauffmann's letter had been sent to Her Majesty's Government by Sir Andrew Buchanan, The Ambassador at St. Petersburg, and that Lord Clarendon, with the concurrence of the Duke of Argyll, instructed Sir A. Buchanan to express satisfaction at the amicable tone of General Kauffmann's letter. The Amir's reply, which was rightly attributed by the Russians to the influence of the Viceroy, was said to have given great satisfaction to the Emperor. II. The next* letter from General Von Kauffmann to the Amir arrived on the 3rd March 1871. It conveyed the acknowledgments of the Russian * See Secret, 1871, Nos. 798-805. Governor-General for the pacific tenor of the Amir's com munication, to which reference has been made in the foregoing section, and reaffirmed the desire of the Emperor to live in peace and harmony with his neighbours. At the request of the Amir His Highness was supplied by the Government of India with an accurate transla tion of the letter, and counselled to reply in terms of gratification at the friendly and peaceful assurances contained therein. This he did. III. f See Secret, May 1872, Nos. 89-93. In December 1871, the Government of India received through the Cabul Agent a letterf addressed by General Von Kauffmann on 28th October 1871 (in Russian and Turki-Persian) to the Amir, who was said to be anxious to obtain a correct translation. On this occasion General Von Kauffmann informed the Amir of the causes which had led to military operations against Kulja : he observed that if the Amir's officers would carry out strictly the orders issued by His Highness to abstain from interference with Bokhara, friendship between Russia and Afghanistan would increase : then followed a broad hint:— “The Amir of Bokhara, a firm friend and ally of Russia, has sent intelligence that Mirza Mahomed Tahir has been deputed to that place (Bokhara) as an Envoy from Cahul;' and the letter closed with congratulations at the supposed happy termination of discord between Shere Ali and his son Yakoob : “My sympathies have been with you throughout the affair since the right was on your side. For God favors not a son who rebels against his father, nor do men wish success to such a one.' The following remarks by Mr. C. U. Aitchison are noteworthy :— “In a late diary the Amir, it was said, contrasted the concluding words of General X See pages, 189 and 218 of Mr. Kauffmann's letter about Yakoob with the interest J we had Wynne’s Cabul Precis. taken in his rebel son. It will be curious to watch whether the Amir sends us a copy of his reply, if he makes any. “ Perhaps it would be a wise thing in sending these translations which the Amir has asked for to put them under cover of a letter from the Viceroy to the Amir I think it would be prudent to do it; ly^, to prevent the Amir from thinking the change in the Viceroyalty § has made any change in the close correspondence that has of late years been § Lord Napier of Ettrick had tem- going on; Rnd, to remove anv soreness the Amir may feel porany succeecet ord Mayo. about Yakoob Khan; and 3n7, to give the Amir an oppor tunity by answering the Viceroy's letter to send a copy of his reply to General Kauffmann. The Amir could hardly reply to His Excellency without sending a copy of his answer to the Russian Governor, and he is not likely to volunteer to send the answer unless we give him a chance.' The translations were then sent to His Highness under cover of a khureeta[| from the || Dated 1st March 1872. Viceroy, in which the Amir was informed that the Viceroy _ was gratified to learn that His Highness' communication to General Von Kauffmann had elicited so satisfactory a reply. J V.

In this letter General Von mended to the Amm’s favor Sirdar Sender Khan, son o£ Sooltan Jan once M e ”T hZ~ who had previously entered the Russian service and then desired to re-visit his mti™ - London and India. Though the Amir in his khureeta to the V^yTade n ' en t “ th.s communication from General Von Kauffmann, he had previously stated through the Cahul Khan miSht ' ° n ‘0 Cabul, secretly correspond When the above-mentioned correspondence reached the Foreign Office Mr C U Aitchison the Foreign Secretary, wrote as follows on 29th May 1872 : ' ' “ I think it will he advisable as heretofore to obtain for the Amir correct translation of the Russian letter. o In forwarding it, the Amir might be informed that Sekunder Khan is now in London, and that the Secretary of State has been informed that His Highness the Amir does not wish him to return to Afghanistan. “It would be well if by some means this correspondence between General Kauffmann and the Amir could be quietly brought to a close. ^ “ It is evidently embarrassing to the Amir. Perhaps a letter to Lord Loftus at St. Pe tersburg might be eifectual.■ ,, Lord Northbrook, however, desired that a draft should be prepared expressing His Lordship's desire to maintain the friendly relations of the Government of India with Afghanistan. This was done by a khureeta of 13th June 1872. The Amir was informed that enquiries had been made through Her Majesty's Government regarding Sekunder Khan, and that it would be the new Viceroy's pleasing duty to maintain the interest felt by the British Govern ment in Afghanistan in such way as might best conduce to His Highness' prosperity. Gene ral Kauffmann's letter was returned, and the Amir thanked for having sent it for the Viceroy's perusal; but no translations appear to have been forwarded, nor was any reply suggested, pro bably because the Amir had not asked us to do so. The Government of India subsequently (in August 1872) received through the Commis- * Dated 13th “ Jamadi-ool-Awul,” sioner of Peshawur translation of the Amir's murasila* to corresponding with 20th July 1872. General Von Kauffmann. In it His Highness acknowledged the Russian Governor-General's “ kind despatch of ‘ Feebral' 1872, every letter and word of which expressed tokens or desire for increasing and confirming the sincere friendship existing between usbriefly referred to “ some information regarding Sekunder Khanand expressed a hope that General Von Kauffmann would always consider His Highness as “desirous of the firmness of friendly relations and cordiality.' V. On the 31st July 1872 the Punjab Government submitted the original Russian and Turki-Persian version of an important letter from General Von Kauffman to the Amir, dated 16th June 1872. The Russian Governor-General acknowledged the Amir's letter of 1st (10th?) Rubee-ul- Awul 1289 (see beginning of Section IV of this note) and remarked :— “The advantages of the interchange of letters are, first, that the circumstance argues existence of mutual good feeling, next, it becomes the cause of strengthening reciprocal friend ship, and the respective subjects of both parties becoming comfortable, it indicates the preserva tion of reciprocal engagements up to date.' The writer continued :— “ Your Highness has mentioned the lands forming the boundary between yourself and Bokhara. This matter was placed and confirmed on its former footing on receipt of your former letter. God willing, it is hoped that no change will take place in this. I trust that the old status will be maintained in perpetuity, for the slightest change causing displeasure to both parties destroys manifestly the comforts of both.' Then, after mentioning the case of Sekunder Khan, the letter went on : “Regarding you, as my friend and neighbour, I inform you that the people in the terri tories entrusted to my charge by the great Imperateur, my sovereign, are all comfortable. At the present time, perfect friendship and amity exists between ourselves and all our neighbours. From the bottom of my heart and in perfect sincerity, I desire that God may preserve you also in comfort, and I sincerely believe you also to be my friend. “Your wisdom and sagacity will doubtless have taught you by the study of history that the Great God wishes that King to rule who preserving his subjects in comfort marntarns mend- ship with his neighbours.' The remarks of the Cabrd Durbar on this communication, as reported in the Agent's letter dated 29th July 1872, so clearly illustrate the apprehensions entertained by the Afghan Ixov- ernment as to the object of the Russian authorities in continurng the correspondence that they are quoted here in extenso ;—■f [ X ] “ Yesterday a murasila from the Russian Governor in Turkistan was received by the Amir in answer to His Highness’ communication mentioned in my petition of 18th May 1872. I append the original murasila to this letter. The Cabul Government will then send an answer to it, when it has been perused by the British Government and returned with an accurate translation into Persian. In the meantime, His Highness the Amir has read the murasila, and caused a copy to be taken of it, which he has sent to Naib Mahomed Alum Khan, ruler of Turkistan, with strict injunctions to keep a good look-out along his frontier, and take the greatest care in managing all affairs along the Bokhara border, so as not to give an opening for any ground of complaint on the part of any foreign State. His Highness in private said that he gathered from this murasila that it was the wish of the Russian authorities to establish a regular and frequent correspondence with the Cabul Government. What demands careful thought in their inconsiderate language is, that notwithstanding that the Russian Gov ernment must have thoroughly apprehended and been convinced that the weal or woe of the Afghan State is entirely bound up in and associated with that of the British Government, still, when writing about boundaries, they make use of this unguarded expression which may indicate, God knows, what intentions in their minds, viz., c for as much as the slightest alteration in intention leads to displeasure between parties, it destroys entirely the harmony which may exist between them/ ” Further, when the Governor of Turkistan writes in his letter that the instructions of his sovereign are to avoid all interference with or annoyance to his neighbours, it is a cause of astonishment that the Russian interpretation of harmony with neighbours is a strange one, for in but a few years they have extended their possessions from the foot of the throne of Russia to the borders of Bokhara, and now style the Afghan State their neighbours, oblivious of the fact that Bokhara and Khiva intervene. “ If [which may God forefendj the country of Bokhara and Khiva becomes theirs, and their frontier is extended without the intervention of any buffer {pardah) to the limits of Afghanistan, which may, indeed, be truly styled the frontier of Hindustan, God only knows w 7 hat line of policy or demeanour they will adopt towards Afghanistan, and what troubles may be in store for the Afghan and English Governments. “ O n these considerations, he was induced to hope that when the British Government has read and understood the drift of this murasila, they may bestow even more serious attention than they have hitherto done on the establishment and maintenance of the boundaries of Afghanistan.” The importance of the case was not overlooked in this department, as will appear from the following note by the Foreign Secretary, dated 6th August 1872 :— “ First. As to the answer to be sent to the Amir. It would, I think, be best to advise the Amir simply to acknowledge its receipt, to thank him (General Yon Kauffmann) for his friendly sentiments, to say that the Amir has already fully explained the peaceful policy to which he means to adhere, and that he confidently looks to General Von Kauffman for the maintenance of the same friendly relations on his part, and for the fulfilment of the repeated assurances given by His Imperial Majesty the Czar and the high officers of the Russian Government to the British Government in regard to Afghanistan. Secondly. As to the anxieties which the Amir feels, it would be well to inform him * See Section L of this note. that since the date of the Viceroy’s letter* of 24th June 1870, His Excellency in Council has no reason to believe that any change has taken place in the views and policy of the Russian Government, and that His Excellency in Council confidently believes that the assurances given by the Russian Govern- ment’ of which the Amir was informed in that letter, will be strictly and faithfully adhered to. &gt; j “ It is a delicate matter to meddle with, hut if General Kauffmann could he got to stop the correspondence of which he is so fond, it would he a satisfactory thing. The Amir is evidently alarmed about it, and is afraid of committing himself.” a + s su g‘8‘ es ti° ns were generally approved by Lord Northbrook, and a khureeta, dated 7th September 1872, was sent to the Amir in the terms proposed. The correspondence was aiso reported to the Secretary of State in despatch No. 65, dated 9th September 1872; mt rough attention was drawn to the expediency of settling the Afghan boundary question, no remarks were offered as to the propriety of putting a stop to General Kauffmann’s letters. Befoie the Viceroy s khureeta of 7th September 1872 was written, the Cabul Agent h t Dated, respectively, 7th and 9th despatched two more letters from the Russian Governor-G “ Jummadipo-Sanee,” 1289 H., corre- neral f—(1) to the Amir (21 to Naib Mahomed Alu spending with 13th and 15th Aua-ust n V 12 -n 11 , 'At • &gt; T ° , 1D • LVianome . a 1872. g Governor of Balkh. Neither of these letters contained ar armrphpncirmc n i i ^ further than general expressions of amity, but t conference will show •-! U ^ overnmerit were Ilot allayed as the following report of the privi/ [ xi ] «It is mentioned in both these despatches that the Russian Government are satisfied with the friendly relations hitherto mamtaiiied towards them by the Government of Afghanistan and they consider it them pleasmg duty to bring tins to the notice of their Emperor and that they desire that the friendly relations existing between them and the Afghan Go^m meat should become more firm and consolidated every day. Under these circumstances,Tb amatterof anxiety what ultimate amsequences these expressions point to, what will be the purport of the Governor-General of Russian Turkistan's communications to this Government 0 “ his return from St Petersburg, and what designs the Russian Government in reality entertains as regards the Afghan State Notwithstanding that the Russian authorities are well aware that the Government of Afghanistan is muted with the British Government, then openly write, unsolicited, letters for. the promotion of their friendship with Afghanistan, and do not relax in the frequency of their communications on the subject, and now they have commenced to send letters to the Governor of Balkh also ” ^ On this the Foreign Department advised that the Russian and Persian letters should be returned through the Punjab Government, and that the Cabul Agent should be instructed, if the Amir talked to him on the subject of the letters and manifested the apprehension which his courtiers entertained, to state that the Governor-General in Council saw in them no ground whatevei foi apprehension, but rather additional reason for believino* that the Russian authorities desired to maintain none but relations of amitv and non-interfer ence with the Government of Afghanistan. ^ Mr. Aitchison, however, remarked “ But the Amir is evidently very nervous about the continued correspondence.' Instructions were then issued, as proposed by letter, to Punjab Government, No. 2043P., dated 30th September 1872, and in despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 72, dated 10th October 1872, it was noted that the Russian communications had created some anxiety in the mind of the Amir. After this, some significant discussion took place in the Cabul Durbar as to the propriety of answering General Kaulfmann in the terms recommended by the Viceroy’s khureeta* of 7th September 1872. Thus, in his letter dated 23rd. September 1872, the Cabul Agent reported that the Amir bad directed a Council to debate upon the insertion of the last sentencef of the suggested reply:— “ His Highness also remarked that he is at a loss to surmise what arrangements the British and the Russian Governments have made between themselves about Afghanistan.” The Amir, however, on the 14th October 1872, sent a friendly acknowledgment of the Viceroy’s khureeta of 7th September, and promised that when an answer should have been written to General Von Kauff- X Vide Section \ of this note. mamPs communication J of 16th June 1872, a copy should be forwarded for the Viceroy's perusal. As a matter of fact, the Amir appears to have left General Von Kauffmann's important letter of 16th June unanswered, and. to have contented himself with acknowledging the less pointed communication of 13th August 1872, mentioned at the beginning of this section. And the reply to that communication was put off until 16th§ § Vide Secret, March 1874, No. 18. N ovem b e r 1873, His Highness attributing the delay to two causes—“first: you went to St. Petersburg, and afterwards you were occupied in the Kharism expedition.” This letter from the Amir is very noteworthy, because it shows that, owing to the suspicions of the Cabul Durbar, the line of reply recommended in the Viceroy s khureeta of 7th September 1872 was not adopted :— “I am much gratified,” wrote the Amir, “ with the contents of your letter explaining that His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia is anxious for the peace and welfare of neigh bouring States, and that you have considered it one of your most pleasing duties to report to His Majesty that you have had every reason to he satisfied with me, and that I have uphe d the friendship existing between us. It is as evident as daylight that at present is ajcsty is a great and powerful Monarch, and it is, therefore, becoming that neig ourmg a should enjoy tranquillity and convenience. This poliey will tend to confiim e nen s ip existing between His Majesty and these States. I have expressed my gratification m my mura- *ila dated 15th Rabi-ul-Awul 1288, written in reply to your murasila of 28th March IS/U— Zilhej 1287, containing your promise that no Russian officer will inter ere wi e a ans o Afghanistan, and that no assistance or advice will be given to the enemies o la mgtom which may he turned against it. I still entertain the hope that 7 e g race 0 0 ^ friendship existing between us will not be disturbed, and that the neighbouring States will he allowed to enjoy peace. “ My attention will always he devoted to this point. It will be observed that the Amir made no specific m ® n ^ on D i m &amp; aW-air^ed 1 from previously given to the Russian Governor-General, and that he carefu y throuo-h appealing to the negotiations between Russia and England. The letter was received thro g the Cabul Agent. * Vide Section V of this note. f “That Your Highness confidently looks for the repeated assurances with regard to Afghanistan which have been given by His Im perial Majesty the ,Czar and the high officers of the Russian Government to the Government of Her Majesty the Queen of England.”The Amir’s reply reached Tashkend during the absence of General Von Kauffmann at St. Petersburg. It was acknowledged by the Acting Governor-General, Kolpakovski, in a very * Vide Secret, November 1874, condescending letter .dated 6th-18th December 1873, which Nos. 1-7. was sent* to us in original Russian by the Cabul Agent, with the Amir’s request that it might be translated into Persian. A photograph of the original was sent to England, and there translated by Mr. Michell. General Kolpakovski’s communica tion contained the following remarkable paragraphs :— “ Being charged with the Government of Turkistan during the absence of His Excellency, I consider it my duty to express to you my satisfaction as regards the feelings of friendship and devotion which you set forth in your letter. “ In despatching the same to the High Governor-General for his favorable consideration I entertain the hope that he will not refuse your request, and that he will represent to His Majesty the Emperor your conscientious made of action and your endeavour to become worthy of the grace of my august master. * *** * * * * * « Continue to follow the same straight road along which you have hitherto gone, and you will become convinced that it is the right and advantageous road as regards both yourself and the welfare of your people.” As the Amir’s letter of 16th November 1873 contained nothing of the nature of a « request,” some doubts were felt whether the translation was correct. The question was asked, in paragraph 3 of despatch No. 32, dated 1st May 1874, and F*e£e K.W., Secret, November 1874, Colonel Burne’s demi-ofRcialf reply of 25th September 1874 os ‘ ' shows that Mr. Rolston of the British Museum had pro nounced the word to be rightly rendered “ request.” The point was, moreover, noticed in our letter No. 989P., dated 1st May 1874, to the Gov ernment of the Punjab, wherein it was said that the Agent might be desired, when delivering the Persian translation of General Kolpakovski’s letter to the Amir, to intimate to His Highness that the reference therein to a “ request” presumably made by His Highness from the Russian Governor-General was not understood by the Government of India. The Commissioner of Peshawur in his No. 64C., dated 27th May 1874, reported that the Agent had delivered the translation to the Amir; but the Commissioner threw no light on the meaning of the word request; he merely forwarded a somewhat fuller translation of the Amir’s letter of 16th November 1873, which had been previously received. It should be added that in paragraph 4 of despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 32P., dated 1st May 1874, attention was called to the tone of General Kolpakovski’s letter, but no notice appears to have been taken of it by Her Majesty’s Government. VII. On the 17thJ December 1873 the Punjab Government forwarded a letter from Syud XVide Secret, March 1874, Nos. Noor Mahomed Shah, Sudder-i-Azam of Cabul, enclosing 52-56. true copy of a letter from General Von Kauffmann to the Amir. The Syud wrote :—“ His Highness has read the letter and fully understood its contents.” Three points should be marked here—(1) it was unusual to address the Viceroy through a § Minister, (2) no translation|| was asked for, (3) our advice was not solicited as to an appropriate reply. General Von Kauffmann’s letter^! gave a brief narrative of recent events in Khiva, the conquest of the country, the abolition of slavery, &amp;c., &amp;c.— “ It is not the wish of His Imperial Majesty to add territories to his extensive Empire. For this reason, by order of His Majesty, the country of Khiva has been allowed to remain as an independent territory as before, and I have placed Syud Mahomed Ruheem Khan on his own guddee and in possession of his ancestral dominions.” § “ If the Syud writes again to His Excellency in the same way, it may be similarly acknowledged, and the Agent at Cabul may then be told by the Commissioner at Peshawur to inform the Syud that it has been the custom heretofore for letters addressed to the Viceroy to be signed by the Amir.” 8-1-74. (Sd.) C. U. A. || (The copy appears to have been in Persian.) If Dated 1st December 1873. Syud Noor Mahomed Shah’s letter was acknowledged by the Foreign Secretary on 17th January 1874, and he was thanked for communicating General Kauffmann’s letter for the information of the Viceroy. The Amir’s reply, dated 25th January 1874, to the Russian Governor-General, was reported with the Cabul Diary of- 27th-29th January 1874. It merely expressed extreme gratification at the perusal of General Von Kauffmann’s letter, and acknowledged receipt of the intelligence that some 460 Afghan slaves released from Khiva were on their way home via Balkh and Maiipena,VJ.11. With the same diary (27th-29th January 1874,), mentioned at the close o£ the precedin-r • Vide Secret, March 1874, No. 76. section, came translation* of a murasila addressed by the Amir to the Russian Governor-General, and announcing'the nomination or Abdoolia Jan as heir-apparent:— ^ « As friendship exists between this Government and His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, I have considered it advisable to send information of this nomination to you/-’ This murasila was acknowledged in the first instance by the Officiating Governor-General Kolpakovski, on the 25th February 1874. Kolpakovski congratulated the Amir on the nomi nation of Abdoolla Jan, and mentioned the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh as follows: “ Your Highness is aware of the friendly relations which hitherto existed between the English and Russian Governments, but lately those relations have been confirmed by an alliance between the rulers of these two kingdoms. The daughter of the Emperor has been married to the second son of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen. I send this happy information to Your Highness on account of the friendship existing between Your Highness and the Russian Government, and hope that you will consider this relationship advantageous to our friendship with the English Government who are favorably disposed to you.” A copy of this communication was merely sent under cover of the Cabul Diary of 27th- 30th March 1874. Subsequent events seemed to show that the marriage of the Grand Duchess rather increased than lessened the suspicions of the Cabul Government. In the first weekf of September 1875 the correspondence between Tashkend and Cabul f FiJe Secret, October 1875, No. 93. entered upon an altogether new phase. Aishan Khwaja j Dated 12th July 1875. Samarcandi, a Russian Envoy, appeared at Cabul, bringing a letterJ from General Von Kauffmann in reply to the two murasilas which the Amir had sent during his absence at St. Petersburg, and both of which, as previously noted, had been § K. W., Secret, October 1875, Nos. acknowledged by General Kolpakovski. Mr. C. U. Aitchison, 89-90. in his note§ of 15th September 1875, pointed out that “ the deputation of an Envoy, or let us call him a messenger, is a great advance on the former system of correspondence exchanged at the frontier.” A copy of General Von KauffmamPs letter (in Persian) was forwarded with the Cabul Diary from 7th to 9th September 1875. The Amir expressed no desire for our advice in the matter, but the report of the Agent indicated that the Durbar were puzzled by the following passage :— “ I hope that the chain of friendship existing between Russia and Afghanistan will in future increase and become firm owing to the recent alliance between the Emperor of Russia and the Queen of England. This alliance has tended to the fulfilment of the best wishes of the two families, and I doubt not that this alliance of the two powers will be an omen for those countries, the people of which, under the protection of the Emperor of Russia and the Queen of England, live in great peace and comfort/’ On these remarks the Durbar observed “ privately” :— “ This time the Russian Government has made itself partner in the protection of Afghan istan. This paragraph is of a new tone. God knows what State secrets are concealed in it. Mr. Aitchison’s note of 25th September 1875 throws light on the above:— His Excellency will remember that on one occasion Syud Noor Mahomed Shah, when at Simla, darkly hinted at the possibility of a common understanding between England and Russia for the partition of Afghanistan. “ This is probably the State secret which the Durbar see in the matrimonial alliance. I do not think we need tell the Agent to make any remarks on the subject at all. However, the Amir’s apprehensions did not prevent him from sending General Von Kauffmann an exceedingly civil reply, a copy of whichaccom- I! Secret, November 1875, No. 55. pan i e d the Diary from 17th—20th September|| 1875. His Highness distinctly invited the continuance of the correspondence thus : By the grace of God nothing contrary to the said friendship shall take place on my part, and the despatc o friendly communications should be considered one of the principles of our friendship. As observed by Mr. Aitchison in his note of 9th October 1875, this was a marked change from the “ God only knows why the Russian Government should display so much anxiety about the affairs of Afghanistan as to take the trouble to write to me of 1870. IX. The Amir’s civil reply mentioned at the close of the preceding section pioduced a rejoinder from General Von Kauffmann, dated 27th October 1875 and sent to Gabu! by the bonrla nf n messenger from the King of Bokhara. A copy 1 Secret, March 1876, No. 80. enclosed by the Agent with Dia!y of 28th-31st1f January 1876. In this General Von Kauffmann gave the Amir “ through real friendship abrief narrative of his recent expedition to Kokand, where he had quelled the disturbances, and afforded comfort to the people ” The Amir acknow- * Secret, May 1876, No. 43. lodged the Governor-GeneraTs letter on the 3rd* February 1876 “ Its contents/’ he wrote, “ tend to promote friendship. The narrative given by you of the mustering of Kipchak and Kirghiz tribes and Kokandis, of the appointment of Nasar- ud-din, son of Khudayar Khan of Kokand, of his falling into difficulties and taking refuge under the mighty powers of Russia, and of your'deputing an army towards Namangan and the frontier of Kokand, and thereby restoring peace among the Russian subjects, &amp;c., has impressed my heart. I strongly hope that, if God pleases, nothing will interfere with the progress of friendship between' Russia and Afghanistan. The favor of your continuing to write to me about your good health is requested.” From the foregoing resume it appears that General Von Kauffmann’s letter of February 1876 (copy of which accompanied letter from Commissioner of Peshawur, No. 2087P., dated 26th June 1876) is not an isolated communication, but one in a series of letters extending from 1870. The letter sets out by observing that it would be contrary to the friendship subsisting between Russia and Afghanistan, if the writer were not to give a brief explanation of the recent momentous occurrences in Kokand. It then proceeds to give a somewhat lengthy narrative of the causes, progress, and suppression of the disorder in that Khanate. After announcing the annexation of Kokand, the writer adds as a supplement a That the Russian Government is bound to deal with friendship and peace in all affairs with their neighbours who govern and rule countries in the East independently, and for this reason Russia abstains from taking possession of them ; though, on the present occasion, we have been constrained to annex Kokand to Russian possessions, in reality, this annexation has not been effected for the interests of Russia, but at the request of the people of Kokand merely to afford them tranquillity, as on account of their evil habits and intentions, old standing dissensions existed amongst these people, as appears from the history of their country, and they could never attain to tranquillity under a Native Government, or till they accepted a power ful ruler on Government. Such a ruler is the Emperor of Russia.” These expressions may be intended to convey a veiled menace, but they may also be nothing more than an apology for proceedings which must seem to the Amir a practical con tradiction of all the assurances of a non-aggressive and non-extension policy so frequently made by Russia. At any rate, it is submitted, there is nothing in the communication which can compare with the sinister hints conveyed in General Von Kauffmann’s letters of March 1870 and 16th June 1872 {vide Sections I and V of this Note), and allowed to pass without remonstrance from the British Government. Whether the correspondence has not throughout been inconsistent with those professions, which will be found in the Appendix, is a different question.

E. HERTSLET, DATED 16th AUGUST 1877. The boundary between Persia and Turkestan has never been clearly “p eo grapM cal Magazine,” October delmecl; and tlie consequence has been that nearly all the unofficial published maps have traced the boundary in different directions ; some have placed it above the Eiver Attrek, some below it, whilst others have marked the course of that river as form ing the northern boundary of Persia near the Caspian Sea. . , . To make the following narrative intelligible, it will be necessary to insert a few outline maps, in order to show how geo graphers have differed m this respect. s In 1834 Arrowsmith published a map to illustrate Lieutenant Burnes’ travels in Persia, &amp;c., and he placed the boundary of Persia to the north of the Eiver Attrek. The following is a sketch of a portion of his map :— 1874, p. 272. “ Geographical Magazine,” October 1876, p. 274. “ Goldsmith’s Eastern Persia.” “ Khanikoff’s Travels.” “Marco Polo,” by Colonel Yule, Vol. I, p. 9. “ Ree’s Cyclopaedia.” “ Hayton’s Central Asia.” “ Penny Cyclopaedia” 1850, Persia. Arrowsmith’s Map, 1834 .In 1841 a map was published at Berlin, by C. Zimmermann, in which the boundary between Persia and Turkestan was drawn also as runnmg some distance above the Attrek, as will be seen from the following sketch . This boundary agrees with “ Sanson’s Atlas,” published in 1700, and with “D’Anyille’s Carte d’Asie,” published about 1750. In 1863 Murray published a map to illustrate Vambery’s travels in Persia, &amp;c., when he gave the Attrek and Goorgaun Rivers to the Turkomans, and marked the Kara-Su as forming the northern boundary of Persia near the Caspian. The following is an extract from his map, which would appear to have been taken from “ Delille’s Carte d’Asie, 1723,” and from “ Kinneir’s Persian Geography, 1813” :— Vamberv’s Map 1863. But the Persians say the districts lying between the Attrek and the Goor gaun Rivers have belonged to them for upwards of 1,000 years. The result of this state of uncertainty as to the actual boundary has been, that disputes have continually arisen between the Persians and Turkomans upon the subject, and have, during the last thirty-five years, been taken up by the Russians.[ xxi ] It will be remembered that in 1842 the Russians took possession of the Confidential Memorandum, No. 2150 . °f Ashoorada in Asterabad Ray; but as a special memorandum has been prepared upon that subject, and an agreement was ultimately arrived at, it is unnecessary to describe here all that passed between 1842 and 1869. In December 1869 an understanding was come to between the Russians and the Persians respecting the Attrek boundary. In that year the Persian Ministers wrote to the Governor of Asterabad to Mr. Thomson, No. 2 i, dated7tii Feb- say that the Russians were not to cross the Attrek, ruary 1870. which was six Jursuhhs distant from the Goorgaun River and Ak-Kaleh, and that they were at liberty to build whatever they liked on the other side of the Attrek, but not on the Persian side. In March 1872 the British Agent at Asterabad also wrote a Report to Mr. Dickson at Teheran, in which he said:— “ The Governor (of Asterabad) has been instructed from Teheran that the Mr. Dickson, No. is, dated isth Attrek is to be the frontier between the Russians Ma y 1S ' 72 - and Persians, and should the Turkomans make any raids in the Asterabad Province, the Russians are to punish them; on the other hand, should they annoy the Russian camp, the Persians are to punish them.” And it was added, that since the tribes who were stationed on and near the Attrek had heard of this arrangement, they had become very quiet and peaceful, hut Mr. Dickson was of opinion that this was simply another version of the arrangement made in 1869, which it no doubt was. Lord a. Loftus, No. 52 , dated 5th It will, however, be evident, from what is stated February ms; n°. m, dated 27 th hereafter, that this arrangement could only have Mr. Thomson, No. so, dated 26th had reference to the territory bordering on the March 1873. Caspian Sea. In January 1878 certain articles appeared in the English press, and more especially in the “ Morning Post,” commenting on the Russian Expedition against Khiva, and on the affairs of Central Asia, in which it was stated that a secret Treaty existed between Persia and Russia, by which the former ceded to the latter the valley of the Attrek. It was officially denied by the Persian Minister in London that any such secret Treaty existed; but the Persian Prime 29 th N ° 23 ’ dated Minister informed Mr. R. Thomson that in 1869, Mr. Thomson, No. io, dated 29 th w hen the Russians w x ere about to occupy Krasno- vodsk on the Caspian, an official declaration had been made by the Russian Minister at Teheran to the effect that the sovereign right of Persia to the territory extending as far as D, Jenet, dated27th January 1875. ^ ^ recogniz?d by the Russian GoVCm- ment; and two years later Mr. Thomson succeeded in obtaining a copy of the autograph memorandum of the Shah upon the subject, a translation from which he forwarded home, and in this memorandum the Shah stated that for the last 1,000 years the Yemoot Turkomans had been subjects of the Shah of Persia. Enclosure in Mr. Thomson’s No. 10 of 29th January 1873. The following is a copy of the Agreement of 13th December 1869 :— “ His Majesty the Shah having on the 12th instant (December 4th) requested the undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Agreement of 13th December 1869. p lenipotent i aiT 0 f His Majesty the Emperor, to explain for wdiat object the fort at Kyzil Soo (Krasnovodsk) was being con structed, and having also required an assurance that the Russian authon les would in no way interfere in the affairs of the Yemoot Turkomans, and o hose living on the Attrek and Goorgaun rivers; also, that no fort or strongho d hould hereafter be built at the embouchures of the Attrek or Goorgaun nveis, md likewise that they should not interfere in any way with the possessions ol Persia, but that the Persian Government should continue to maintain tde authority they have hitherto held in respect to these tribes and their territories,[ xxii ] in accordance with the wish expressed hy His Majesty the Shah, the under signed lost no time in referring hy telegraph to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor, and he has now the pleasure to bring to the knowledge of the Ministers of His Majesty the Shah the reply which he has just received, to the effect that the Government of His Majesty the Emperor recognizes the authority and sovereignty of Persia up to the banks of the Attrek Piver, that they have no intention to construct any fort. % (Sd.) “M. Beger.” There existed at this time a map which had been published hy the Russian Asiatic Society, and upon it the River Attrek was marked as is shown on the following sketch. The Russians at that time made no claim to any portion of the shores of the Caspian Sea between Krasnovodsk and the Attrek, and it will he observed that the northern boundary of Persia only is coloured. It should also be observed that in this map a portion, and not the whole, of the tributary streams of the Attrek are given to Persia. Russian Map I 863. Johnstone’s map, published in 1846, traces the boundary line very much in the same direction as the above. On the 5th February 1873 Lord A. Loftus reported that he had had an Lora a. Loftus, No. 52 , dated 5 th interview with M. de Stremoouchow, the Director February 1873. 0 f Asiatic Department in the Russian Foreign Office, respecting this supposed secret Treaty, and that M. de Stremoouchow had also denied that any such engagement existed, supporting this denial by reminding Lord Augustus that an agreement (“un accord”) had been come to some years previously between England and Russia, by which both countries had agreed to respect the integrity of the Persian territory. Lord A. Loftus stated, however, that M. de Stremoouchow had informed him that, in 1865 [? 1869], the Russian Goyernment, with a view to facilitate the suppression of brigandage and piracy on the part of the nomad tribes frequenting the shores of the Caspian, had proposed to the Persian Government to make the Attrek river the boundary of Persia, in-lieu of another small river (the Koja-Su)t which was more to the south of the Attrek, and which had hitherto been the recognized frontier; and that, consequently, the Persian territory was increased rather than diminished; or, as His Lordship observed to M. de Stremoouchow, * * See pages XXXIV and XXXVIII. t See also page XXV.that Russia had by this arrangement disposed of a strip of land in favor of Persia which virtually did not belong to her. Lord A. Loftus further stated that he had been informed that this arrange ment was recorded in an official communication addressed to the Persian Government without any instrument of a bilateral nature; and that it was agreed that the two Governments should mutually assist each other in the sup pression of the forages of the nomad tribes, and that for this purpose, at the corner of the Caspian Sea, north of the Attrek, a small Russian encampment (said not to be a fort in the usual signification of the term) was established solely for the purpose - of watching the nomad tribes and of protecting the Croats. This afterwards proved to be Chikishlar. With regard to the Goorgaun boundary, Mr. R. Thomson also reported Mr. w. Thomson, No. 16, dated that Persia had always asserted, and at times had 22 nd April 1873. established, their authority over the territory lying between the Goorgaun and the Attrek ; and that although they had not occu pied in recent times the lands on the right bank of the latter river, the tribes on the left bank which professed allegiance to the Shah migrated from the lands on the left to those on the right bank for pastoral purposes. Just about this same time news reached Her Majesty’s Government that Mr. k.

The fort of Kyzil-Arvad was stated by the As- terabad Agent to he two stages distant from Karee- Kala, which, he said, was the boundary between the Tekkeh country and Khorassan. In a subsequent letter the Agent stated that Kyzil-Arvad had been vacated by the Russians, who had encamped at Chikishlar, on the shores of the Caspian, four fursuklis from the embouchure of the At trek River; and he added that he had been informed that an official arrangement existed between Persia and Russia, by which it was agreed that “from the Attreh waters up to jBalkhan [to the north, toward Krasno- vodsk] was to he with Russia.” Shortly after this, it was rumoured that the Russians possessed a fort on Mr. Abbott, No. 7, dated 6th Feb- the Attrek ; and on the 6th February 1873 Consul- mary 1873. General Abbott, then of Odessa (but late Consul- General at Tabreez), reported that he had learned from pretty good authority that such a fort really did exist at a short distance from the mouth of the stream and on its right or north bank; and it was subsequently ascertained that a fort had really been erected by the Russians at Chikishlar. Mr. Abbott added, in this report, that “ Persia laid claim to the country only up to the southern bank of the Attrek, and that Russia, therefore, in taking possession of a spot on the northern bank of that stream, had seemingly infringed rather on the rights of Khiva than on those of Persia, as the former State claimed the allegiance of all the tribes lying between it and the Caspian, who were not actually under Persian dominion.” On the 27th February the Persian Minister in London called upon Lord To Mr. r. Thomson, No. 20 , dated Granville, and after informing His Lordship that 27 th February 1873. . Government were becoming uneasy at the tone taken by the Press on the subject of the Central Asian question, enquired whether the time had not come for recognizing the integrity of Persia as well as that of Afghanistan, when he was informed of the understanding which had been come to between England and Russia in Confidential paper, No. 2136. 1834 upon the subject of the independence and integrity of Persia. At a subsequent interview which Lord A. Loftus bad with M. Stremoou- Lord a. Loftus, No. 92 , dated 5th chow, Director of the Asiatic Department in the March 1873. Russian Foreign Office, his Lordship enquired the date and the circumstances under which the River Attrek was declared to be the northern frontier of Persia, when His Excellency repeated Lord a. Loftus, No. 92 , dated 5th what he had stated on a previous occasion, J March 1873. that, in 1865 [? 1869], the Russian Government had suggested to that of Persia to transfer the frontier from the Koja-Su River (between the Attrek and the Goorgaun, which had hitherto been considered as the boundary) to the Attrek, w ith a view r to establish a definite demarcation of the Persian territory; but he denied that any treaty or written engagement had been entered into between the two Governments, or that any Firman had * Barn, Barnee, or Barni. f Boorma or Beurma. t See page XXII.I l°ff [ XXV ] been issued by the Government of the Shah on the subject; and M. de Stremoouchow remarked that the territory referred to was a wild, uncultivated uninhabited steppe, and, in reality, had no other proprietor than the nomad lawless tribes of Turkomans. M. de Stremoouchow then placed in Lord A. Loftus’ bands, confidentially, a memoir which he had prepared, giving an historical analysis of the circum stances which had led to an understanding between England and Russia in respect to the affairs of Persia in 1834, and Lord A. Loftus remarked, that from this statement it would appear that the change of the frontier line referred to gave an increase, and not a diminution, of territory to Persia. M. de Stremoouchow at the same time disclaimed any intention on the part of the Imperial Government of encroaching on the Persian territory, reminding Lord Augustus of the understanding come to between Great Britain and Russia in 1834, and confirmed by Lord Palmerston in 1838, to respect the integrity of the Shah’s dominions; and he expressed some annoyanc'e at the Lord a. Loftus, No. 147, dated isth tone of the English Press, i m plying a continued distrust and suspicion of Russian designs. Never theless, on the 10th March following, a Russian detachment crossed the Attrek and attacked the Yemoot Turkomans within eight miles of Astera- bad; and on an explanation being demanded by Persia, the Russian Government replied that the act was one of necessity, as the frontier was left unguarded hy Persia, but that it was not an act of aggres sion, and that the Imperial Government fully recognized the Attrek as the frontier between Russia and Persia. The Russian Government thought that the Persian note was written at the instigation of the British Government, and felt some uneasiness in consequence. April 1873 Lord A. Loftus, No. 150, dated 16th April 1873. Lord A. Loftus No. 157, dated 23rd April 1873. Mr. Thomson, No. 30, dated 26th March 1873. The Russian Minister declared that he had informed the Persian Govern ment beforehand of their intention to undertake such an expedition ; but this was positively denied by the Persian Prime Minister, who assured Mr. R. Thomson that, on the contrary, on the occasion referred to, he had repeated the protest already made against an armed Russian force entering the Persian territory on any pretext whatever; and His Excellency showed Mr. Thomson the letter in which he had also remonstrated against the movements of the Russian reconnoitring expedition, sent in the autumn of 1872, along the right hank of the Attrek, to Karee-Kala, and the districts lying to the north of Boodjnoord. Mr. Thomson also reported that the Persian Government considered that Mr. Thomson, No. so, dated 26th the declaration made hy Russia on the 13th Decem- March !873. her 1869* had no reference to the territory in the interior towards Khorassan, but regarded only the territory adjoining the Province of Asterabad, that is to say, from the Caspian Sea, at the mouth of the Attrek, along the banks of that river for about thirty miles, to where the Goorgaun district ended ; but that, although this had been clearly explained by the Sadr Azim to the Russian Minister, he avoided a discussion of the question. It may here be as well to draw attention to the fact that up to this date the discussions which had passed between Persia and Russia had chiefly refer ence to the boundary of that portion only of the Persian territory which abutted on the Caspian Sea. But about this time an understanding was come to between Lord Granville, and Count Schouvaloff respecting the boundary of Afghanistan, &amp;c., am almost immediately afterwards, that is to say in March 18/3, a revise edition was issued of the Map of Central Asia, which had been published in 1863 by the Russian Asiatic Society, and upon if was shown, tor e is time, the Russian boundary as joining the Persian, and extending a ong ienorth bank of the Attrek, from its mouth to a very considerable, but undefined, distance inland, and leaving Karee-Kala far without the Persian boundary. RussianMap 18 73 . Sir Henry Hawlinson drew the special attention of the India Office to this Russian Map, wherein the colouring had been India office, dated 23rd May 18/3. a ^ ere( j [ n man y directions from the previous map; and with regard to the Attrek boundary he said:— “ The Russian frontier is laid down from the embouchure of the Attrek in the Caspian along the main stream of the river for about 200 miles, or as far as the meridian of Boodjnoord, but Persia certainly claims all the valleys through which flow the right hand affluents of the Attrek, these valleys indeed being inhabited by the Kurdish colonists who were placed there by Shah Abbas to guard the Khorassan frontier against the inroads of the Turkomans. Persia claims as her frontier in this quarter—the line off the Attrek to the junction of the Sumbar; 2ndly, the course of that river to its source in the Kuren-dagb; and 2&gt;rdly, the watershed dividing the streams, which flow into the Attrek from the running north-west towards the Turkoman desert, and watering the lands of the Tekkehs at the base of the hills. It is interesting to observe from this map that the Russians appear to have surveyed a line of route along the northern slopes of these hills from the vicinity of the Caspian to Merve, every Turkoman village and fort being laid down with topographical precision.” Lord Granville was, however, of opinion that it would not be expedient „ T t 10 „ 0 to enter into a discussion with Russia relative to To India Office, dated 28th May 1873. . „ .. . , the inaccuracies of this map, and no official notice was, therefore, taken of it; but attention was drawn to it in Parliament. Hansard, Vol. 216, p. 841. The Persian Government then became alive to the danger which the Russian occupation of the Attrek would cause to their country, and Mr. Thomson suggested, under certain conditions, the lOth line of north latitude, extending from Krasnovodsk to the Oxus, as a line not to be destitute of advantageous results; but this suggestion was not adopted. But on the 23rd of March of this year (1873), Prince Gortchakoff addressed an official despatch to M. Beger, the Russian Lord A. Loftus, No. 150, dated 16th April 18'/3. Minister at Teheran, in which the following passage occurred :■ “ Si les reclamations formulees par M. le Ministre de Perse au nom de son Gouyernement n’ont eu en vue que d’affirmer une fois de plus une question de principe, c’est-a-dire, le maintien de PAtrek comme marquant la limite jusqu ou sytend la souverainete du Schahduswr la steppe Turcomane, vows efces autorise, d’ordre de I’Empereur, a donner aux Ministres de Sa Majeste Persane 1’assurance positive que le Cabinet Imperial n’eprouve aucune difficulte a renou- veler des declarations deja faites en son nom par M. le Prince Ourouskow.”India OfeJ wing m ipreiin s of tie IV Onnles,#!; : : ' i all tie t| |: levateii j by Slitll t komans, te iktotlejii tlieEim4J tie ittelfe aterlngtlels aseiTe &amp;®2 route ataji apian to fc I’ icalpm® 1 iot be toiarefei io official 'aiiianient ; mger : { TTOllW tt 1 ’ 1 suggesi ^ ^ ■ooi Erasiff^ results; te ! -| ehakoffa^ ;rj tie S®* | [ xxvii ] But in speaking of the depredations committed by the Turkomans, he went on to say :— “Pour sa part, le Cabinet Imperial est resolu apoursuivre energiquement Tceuvre de pacification et de civilisation qui lui est devolue dans ces parages. “II l’a rempli jusqu’ici en partie en reprimant par la surveillance de la croisi&amp;re ‘Ashourade’ les depredations maritimes des Turcomans, au grand benefice des habitants du littoral Persan de la Caspienne.

C’est la le but de notre etablissement a Krasnovodsk et des recon naissances actuelles executes par nos troupes sur TAtrek. “ Le Cabinet Imperial devrait pouvoir compter sur un loyal concours de la part du Gouvernement Persan.”' In May following the Shah of Persia visited St. Petersburg, accompanied Lord a. Loftus, No. 213, dated 27 th by the Grand Vizier and others, and in a conversa- Ma y 1873 - tion which Lord A. Loftus had with the Grand Vizier, His Highness informed His Lordship that he had had an interview with Prince Gortchakoff, and that, in referring to the frontier of the Attrek, he had told the Prince that a short time previously a report had been circulated of a secret Treaty existing between Persia and Russia, by which the Persian Government had given up the line of the Attrek to Russia; and that he had, therefore, instructed the Persian representative in London to give a formal denial to this report, as no such treaty existed : and he added that he had de clared most positively and categorically to Prince Gortchakoff that Persia had only agreed to the mouth of the Attreh as the frontier on the coast of the Caspian, bwi it ddii not include the whole course of the Attrek to its source, which would have amounted to an abandonment of Persian territory; but to this remark Prince Gortchakoff made no reply, either in the affirmative or in the negative. Subsequently Lord A. Loftus had an interview with Malcolm Khan, being Lord a. Loftus, No. 226, dated 28 th anxious to ascertain what had taken place on pohti- May 1873. cal subjects between the Persian Minister and the Imperial Government; but His Lordship stated that he could not learn from His Highness that any positive proposals had been made in regard to the fron tier of the Attrek. He expressed his belief, however, that when the Shah had quitted Russian territory, it would be found that the Russian Government had strained every nerve to obtain the Shah’s assent to the wdiole course of the Attrek as the frontier, and the withdrawal of the concession to Baron Reuter. At another interview the Sadr Azim told Lord Augustus that the Persian Government had not recognized the Attrek as the frontier of Persia, but only as the frontier of the Caspian ; and he assured His Lordship that his Govern- had no intention of giving up that portion of the Attrek valley, which had always formed part of the Persian territory. In reporting this conversation, Lord Augustus remarked that Russia claim ed the whole course of the Attrek. On the 30th June Hossain Khan again enquired of Lord Granville what Persian Grand vizier, dated soth formal understanding existed between Great Britain June 1873.’ and Russia for the maintenance of the integrity ot Persia, wdien he was again informed of what had passed in ISoI and IS 08 , at which he expressed his satisfaction. The Russian movements towards Khiva were still watched with much anxiety, and their proceedings on the Attrek frontier in the interior were u y Mr. w. Thomson, No. 28, dated 2nd reported on by the British Agen a m I? Mayws. stated that, on the 3rd April 1873, he had paid a visit to the Governor of Boodjnoord, and inquired after the Russian m ovement s 8 * See page XXIV.[ xxviii ] in Akhal, when the Governor had informed him that, in the previous November, 4,000 Russian troops went to Kyzil-Arvad and Karee-Kala and dispersed the Turkomans who were stationary at those places, and that after remaining twelve days they went away, but returned at the latter part of February 1873. The Agent then enquired why they had gone by the Akhal, to which the Governor replied that three stages on the other road to Khiva the mud was so deep that no horse or guns could pass over, and they were therefore obliged to go to Akhal, and march on Khiva by Kyzil-Arvad and Room. A few days later the Agent had another interview^ with the Governor, who Mr. w. Thomson, No. 28, dated 2nd told him that he had received letters from Boodj- May 1873. noord, stating that a body of more than 4,000 Rus sian horse had advanced to within twenty fursukhs of Boodj noord, where there was a lofty mountain, and that they had set up a mark thereon ; that they then took a number of Turkomans as guides, captured a number of Yemoot and Gooklan Turkomans, and seized some of the Gooklans who paid revenue to the Persian Crown. Upon this Report Mr. W. Thomson observed that although the Governor Mr. w. Thomson, No. 28 , dated 2 nd of Boodj noord (Yar Mhhomed Khan) had just receiv- Ma y 1873 - ed investiture from the Shah as Governor of that important district, he did not hesitate to express the most amicable sentiments for the Russian General who had twice taken armed possession of the Persian Mr. w. Thomson, No. 69, dated 20 th 1 erritory in his immediate neighbourhood; and here June 1872. it may be observed that, w 7 hen Colonel Baker, Captain Clayton, and Lieutenant Gill visited that neighbourhood in June 1873, they enquired of the Russian Consul at Asterabad whether a Persian escort and guides could be procured for the district lying between the Goor- gaun and the left bank of the Attrek, -when they were told that, if the Persians attempted to cross that district, it would be his (the Russian Consul’s) duty to prevent them, and that if found within it they would be taken prisoners. In the following month Mr. Thomson pointed out to the Persian Govern- Mr. w. Thomson, No. si, dated i9th ment that Krasnovodsk to the north, and Ashoo- rada, in the Bay of Asterabad, to the south; were all that were required by Russia on the coast, but that Karee-Kala, in the valley of the Attrek, and other posts in the upper portion of it would not fail in due time to be occupied by the Russians. He also pointed out how in reality the excuse for the occupation of the Attrek, as a part of the military operations against Khiva, was a mere pretext; that Khiva, if captured, must be captured from the side of the Aral and Rivers Jihoon and Sihoon, of which the proof existed in the fact of Marcosoff’s recon- noissance in 1872, and of his having returned without having afforded the slightest aid to the columns really acting against Khiva; that the real object in gaining a footing on the Attrek -was to enable the Russian troops in the first place, and Cossack colonists later, to act against the Turkomans, with whom, at the shortest warning, they could be, as best suited them, in a position to act offensively, not only throughout the whole length of the valley of the Attrek, but to tollow them up, as need might be, across the plains of Surrukhs and Merve to the banks of the Oxus, and under the same pretext, if it should suit them, to parts of the Afghan territory, in which there was a joint occu pation of Turkoman and Afghan tribes. July 1873. Mr. W. Thomson, No. 99, dated 16th August 1873. Lord A. Loftus, No, 442, most se cret, dated 8th December 1874. n 4 M V ^-^ 10n ^ S011 th en assured Lord Granville that it seemed to him desirable that a declaration should be obtained from Russia, as early as possible, as to the meaning she attached to the statement, that she recognized the valley of the Au?ust T i 873 SOn ’ N °' dated 16th AttrelK as h er llrie °f frontier with Persia; and in ,, ° , . * a subsequent despatch he informed His Lordship _ mt in 1 bob the bhah made a journey to the province of Khorassan, when His a Journal, in which the following entry was made :—“ The River ±5attrek L^cJ, which flows by Koochan, has its source on the north of the Dereghez mountain. On its passing Koochan and entering the province of Boodjnoord,rUs ealMSmim Bar and when it reaches Goorgaun it is named the Attrek” But this statement is both vague and unintelligible. Mr. Thomson then pointed out how the portion of territory lying between the Attrek and Goorgaun as an aggressive strategical position, was of the utmost value to Russia. ’ Shortly after this it was rumoured that the Russians were assuming a India Office, dated 15tli October threatening attitude towards the tribes nf If 3 ' ,, , , . and a correspondence passed upon the subject: but ,t would extend this paper to an inconvenient length if an attempt were made either to describe the various events which have transpired with regard to Mervo, which bear upon the general question of the northern frontier of Afghanistan, or to the Khiva expedition, and it has been thought advisable therefore, to restrict this memorandum to the simple question of the Attrek frontier. In November 1872 a Eussian expedition was undertaken against Khiva, Lord a. Loftus, No. 415, dated 22 nd and on the 24th August 1873 a Treaty of Peace November 1873 was signed between Russia and Khiva, wherein the boundary between the Eussian and Khivan territories were thus defined:— The boundary between the Russian and Khivan territories shall be the Amu Daria from Kukertli down the river as far as the point at which the most westerly branch of the Amu Daria leaves the main stream, and from that point the frontier shall pass along such branch as far as its mouth in the Aral Sea. Further, the frontier shall extend along the sea coast to Cape Urgu, and from thence along, the base of the chink (escarpment) of the Ost-Ort, following the so-called ancient bed of the Amn Daria. On the 21th October 1873 Sir Joseph Dickson, Physician to the BritishLega- Mr. w. Thomson, dated 25tk Octo- tion at Teheran, had a confidential conversation with herim - tire ex-Grand Vizier on various points connected with Persian interests, including those of Seistan, Merve, and the Attrek. With regard to the question of the Attrek, the ex-Grand Vizier said he was decidedly of opinion that there was every possibility for the Persian Government to get out of the dilemma caused by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and that he had assured the Shah when in Russia that in two months after his return to Teheran he would settle that affair; for that whifst at St. Petersburg, in the presence of the Shah and the Emperor, he had declared to Prince Gortchakoff that the Persian Government only admitted “ to near the month of the river {Vembouchure) and not the line along its course.” But in sending home a copy of this memorandum Mr. Thomson pointed out that, with regard to the first statement, no indication was given of the manner in which the dilemma was to be overcome; and in the second, that the declaration of the Persian Grand Vizier would appear to strengthen the pre tensions of Russia to the Attrek line of frontier rather than to weaken them. The continued Russian movements in Turkestan now began greatly to Memorandum by Malcolm Khan, alarm the Persian Government, so much so, that dated 8th April 1874. on ^he 8th April 1874 the Persian Minister in London, Malcolm Khan, communicated a memorandum to the Earl of Derby, in which he pointed out the dangers with which Persia was surroundedand with reference to the Attrek, he said: “ La perte de ces magnifiques provinces (Mazanderan et Gkilan), quelque mortelle qu’elle fut pour la Perse, ne presen- terait pas pent-etre, a certains esprits, une gravite assez immediate, pour preoc- cuper d&amp;s maintenant le Gouvernement Anglais. Mais ce Gpuvernement pourrait-il garder une egale indifference devant cette autre direction, si claire et si mena§ante, que prend la Russie, du c6te de PAtrak, a travers nos tnbus Turcomanes, ayant pour objective inevitable Merve, Pancie.nne capitale de Khorassan.” And again, “ Quant a nous, nous sommes certains que le seul systeme des caravanes qu’on organise a Moscou et an Caucase, avec les elemen s ttulitaires, suffirait pour etablir paisiblement la domination Basse sur les deux nves de PAtrak. Et alors que resterait-il aux Russes pour arnver a MerveBut at this very time it afterwards appeared that Persia had been renewing Lord a Loft™, No. 429 , Secret, their proposals to the Russian Government for a dated 24th November 1874. concerted military action against the Turkomans in the neighbourhood of the Attrek. Early in 1874 Mr. Thomson reported that it was the intention of the Persian Government to form in the. spring of that cemb;rm 3 Thorason ’ dated 28th De ‘ year a camp of 10,000 men at Cheh-Cheheh, a Mr. w. Thomson, No. 40 , dated 20 th sm all fort then recently constructed between Koo- February 1874. chan and Kelat-i-Nadir; and it was at the same time stated that the Russians would send a force against the Turkomans in that neighbourhood; and Mr. Thomson, in one of 28 th 1 FebIuary Tsh.’ No ’ 5 °’ daUd his despatches, written about the same time, said, Mr. w. Thomson, No. 51 , dated 1 st “ Persia appears to have become quite reconciled to Maich 1874. acting in concert with Russia on the line of the Attrek and the Akhal, and such being the case, once Russia is established on that line, it is but reasonable to assume that her posts of communication with the Caspian are intended to be permanent ones.” But if any further doubt existed on this point, it was removed by the issue of a Russian Imperial Regulation or Statute on Ap-u rd i 874 LoftUS ’ N °’ 152 ’ dated 14th the March 1874, for the administration of the Ap^ius 74 LoftUS ’ N ° 156 ’ dated 15th Trans-Caspian region, in which it was stated that the new territory would comprise Manghischlak and the country occupied by Russia on the eastern bank of the Caspian, around Lord a. Loftus No. 156 , dated 15 th Krasnovodsk, extending from Mestry-Kouthouk April 1874. “up to the Attrek which formed the boundary between Russia and RersiaR or in other words, that “the Trans-Caspian region, which formed part of the Trans-Caspian military district, extended southward to the River Attrek and eastwards to the frontier of the Khanate of Khiva. But notwithstanding this notification, the then newly-appointed Russian Mr. w. Thomson, dated 19 th May Governor of Krasnovodsk (Major-General Loma- 18 ' 74 - kin*) addressed to the Chiefs of the Attrek and Goorgaun Turkoman tribes a circular letter or proclamation informing them that he had been appointed, by the Grand Duke Michael, their Chief. As soon as the Persian Government became aware of this proclamation, To Mr, w. Thomson, doted 3rd June explanation of it was demanded from the Russian 1874. Minister at Teheran, when he assured the Persian secreMated ““iLemtem ”° st Government that “ there had been a mistake arising from there being two tribes of Yemoots, one near Khiva,, another near the Caspian.” But as the Russian Governor had refused to admit that the Attrek formed the boundary of the tw T o countries, but declared the frontier to be on the Karasso (Koja-Su?),f the Persian Minister in London called at the Foreign Office, and after explaining to Lord Derby his views of Russian designs, and calling attention to the fact that the Russian Governor had invited certain Turkoman Chiefs, who w ; ere Persian subjects, to come to him, describing himself as Master of the Attrek and the Goorgaun, he asked for an assurance that England w^ould help Persia in case of need; to which Lord Derby replied that the question was too serious to be answered off-hand, more especially as it referred to a state of things w r hich had not occurred, and possibly might never occur, but His Lordship expressed the friendly feelings which Her Majesty’s Government entertained towards Persia, and his hope that the Persian.Government would on all occasions communicate frankly with that of Her Majesty. But so far from any “ mistake” having occurred, as stated by the Russian Abstract of Papers from India office; Minister at Teheran, it afterwards transpired that on entui paper, 25o5, page 143 . Major-General Lomakin, while at Krasnovodsk, * Llamakin, Lomaken, or Lamakine.had received twenty elders of the Turkomans camping in the vicinity, whom he treated with the greatest kindness, endeavouring to inspire them with a perfect trust and confidence in the E/ussians, and that these elders thereupon promised to prevail upon all the leading men among the Trans-Caspian Yemoot Turkomans to present themselves to the General at Krasnovodsk in the sprum of the year 1874. So that by this means, as well as by letters of invitation from Krasnovodsk to all the Yemoots, a large congregation of Turkomans (comprising upwards of seventy representatives) from various parts, as well as from the country between the Attrek and the Goorgaun Eivers, assembled at Krasnovodsk in the spring. When they arrived, the elders represented that tbe Eussian letters of invitation had produced a very favorable impression upon the people south of the Attrek-, some of the Trans-Attrek elders going so far in their display of friendly feeling as to lay carpets along the pier when the General landed. The following is a description of the interview which took place:— After a great religions ceremony, General Lomakin received the Turko man elders, to whom he spoke in very assuring language, after acknowledging their congratulations on his appointment as Chief Officer over the Trans- Caspian region. His Government, he told them, had peaceful and friendly intentions, which, with the demands that would be made upon the Turkomans, aimed exclusively at the pacification of the steppes separating the Eussians from their fresh acquisitions on the Oxus. Tranquillity and security in those steppes were, he said, indispensable for the maintenance of regular communication with the Russian troops in the new district on the Oxus. He pointed out that this condition of the steppes would prove to be a great benefit .to the Turkomans, as they would then be able to pasture and multiply their flocks without hin drance or fear; that trade would flourish among them, and the Turkomans would become prosperous and happy. To this the representatives of the Jafarbai and Atabai tribes,* numbering 15,000 tents, camping in the winter between the Attrek and the Goorgaun, and in the summer in the Balkans and along the Hzboi (supposed ancient course of the Oxus), replied to the following effect:— After various congratulations in the name of their people, they stated to General Lomakin that' they were fully assured that the Eussians had established themselves for ever in the Trans-Caspian region, that they could not oppose the Russians, that they themselves had no other country to fall back upon, and were consequently convinced that it was only by an unconditional obedience to the Russians that their own happiness could be secured. They accordingly tendered their humble submission to the Eussian Government, and prayed the Commander-in-Chief of the Caucasus, the brother of the great Aga-Padishah, to accept their allegiance, and to take them under his merciful protection. It was subsequently reported that about 80,000 tents of Khivan Gooklans „ , hMrl vp moved from Khiva to the upper waters Mr. R.

That there was no promise exacted or given by the Tekkeh Turkomans of allegiance to Russia (as was also stated in the telegram in the Times). M. de Stremoouchow also assured Lord Augustus, at another interview, Lord a. Loftus, No. 210 , dated 23 rd that General Lomakin had only addressed letters June 1874. to the Chiefs of the Turkoman tribes who inhabited the country between Khiva and the Caspian, as well as to those who periodic cally visited the districts south of the Attrek and extended their wanderings as far north as Krasnovodsk, expressing a wish to be on friendly terms with them, and a hope that they would abstain from acts of disorder or destruction to the commerce of the steppes. But, notwithstanding this assurance, the Asterabad Agent reported to Mr. Mr. w. Thomson, No. 130 , dated Thomson, on the 30th May 1874, that the Russian i9th June 1874. General had recently landed with a number of sol diers at a place called Shah Kadem, which was eight stages distant from Astera bad, and had encamped there ; that he had addressed a circular to the Chiefs of the different tribes of the Yemoot Turkomans, saying that from the Jerjan (Goorgaun), which wms three fursukhs distant from Asterabad, as far as Khiva belonged to Russia; that, therefore, each tribe must send several persons to him that he might arrange matters with them, as, in f uture, Russian merchants and carriers woidd travel hg this route; and that arrangements ought to be made for their safety. The Turkomans, it would appear, took this letter to the Governor-General of Asterabad, who referred the matter to Teheran, from whence he received an answer stating that,/nm Mi/*? of the Attrek, which was eight fur- sukhs distant from Asterabad, was Russian territory, but that the Russians had no right to interfere with such tribes as resided on the banks of the Goorgaun. The Governor-General, however, was instructed not to stir up matters, hut to see what course events would take; but subsequently the Governor-General received another telegram from Teheran, instructing him to proceed with troops to Ak-Kaleh and sympathize with the Turkomans, assuring them that the Rus sian Government had nothing to do with them. General Lomakin endeavoured to persuade the Governor-General and other Mr. w. Thomson, No. 137 , dated Persian authorities at Asterabad that they had 30th June 1874. greatly exaggerated the scope and purpose of his letters to the Turkoman Chiefs, and stated that his intention was simply to give them good advice, with a view to the preservation of peace and tran quillity on the frontier, but his language failed to produce any impression India Office, dated 2nd October either at Asterabad or Teheran, his announcement 18 ' 4 ‘ _ having been so explicit that he was appointed by the Grand Duke Michael, under order of the Emperor, to be Supreme Com mander (Sahib Ikhtiar) over the Turkoman tribes of the Attrek and Goorgaun. Mr. Thomson again drew attention at this time to the great importance of w Thomson, No. 136, dated the district of Merve, in a strategic point of view, 18/1 ’ in connection with the routes leading from the south-eastern corner of the Caspian through the valleys of the Attrek and Goorgaun, and having in view how powerful these districts might become for aggiessive purposes in the hands of Russia should she be permitted to establish in them Cossack Turkoman colonies.

After A ,, . , ,. , explaining to him verbally tlie state of affairs, as they then existed between the Lussian and the Persian authorities on the north eastern frontier, he pointed out that it was very desirable that he should with out committing himself to any expression of opinion, ascertain the feelings of the principal feudal chiefs, whether Persian or Turkoman, having possessions ’ m the north-eastern portion of Khorassan, and the districts lying between Pereghez, Koochan, and the Caspian. On the 10th August following, Captain Napier arrived at Meshed, when Mr. w.

Their claim, though resisted by the Governor ol Asterahad, to whom these settlers paid tribute, had been, it was said, admitted y the Persian Government. Captain Napier pointed out that, though the loss ol such subjects ought to he rather a source of congratulation, the concession gave to Russia a u pied a terre” south of the Attrek, or, in fact, command of that As we for fifty miles of its course. On the 2nd September, it was announced in the Turkestan Russian India Office, dated 25th March 1875 . Gaz ette that the Yemoot and Tagah Turkomans, and the branches of the Atahai and Jafarhai clans 10 si ding to the east of the Caspian Sea, as well as the Tagah Turkomans of Oerve, had come under the allegiance of the Russian Government, and it was subsequently reported to the Persian Government that the Chief of the Ak-Ata- lai tribe had become a Russian protege, with 100 families, most of whom were Ls relatives, and that the usual passports had been granted to all of them; rim.

The rumour as to what had taken place was soon after confirmed by a despatch from Lord Augustus Loftns, in which His Lord A. roftus, mQst r^gpip reported in a most secret and confidential Lord a. Lottos, No. 377 , secret and despatcii that a Protocol ol a uonierence had been confidential, dated 14 th October 1874. ^ Petersburg on the 1874 on the affairs of Central Asia, at which were present the Grand Luke Constantine, the Grand Duke Michael, General Milintine (Minister of War), M. de West- mann (Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs), and Admiral Sesowsky (Acting Minister of Marine) ; and that the Resolutions then adopted were approved by the Emperor on the ^fth August, and attested by his signature. This secret Protocol threw a clear light on the intentions of Russia in ' regard to the Turkoman tribe and to the territory between Khiva and the Attrek, which steppe ivas regarded as annexed to Russia as far as the Attrek. It also showed that the Russian Government was fully alive to the im portance of occupying a strategic point on the Attiek, and that it was their intention to occupy provisionally, if not permanently, a place at or near Baiat- Hodji-Olum (or Hajee Bayat),* situated at a distance of about 80 versts from the Caspian. The Russian Government were evidently anxious to avoid taking any steps which might give rise to complications with England or Persiaand it was suggested at the Conference that the re-establishment of the port at Chikish- lar might be effected more easily and with less notice, and would not appear in. the light of an aggressive movement, such as the occupation of Baiat-Hodji- Olum w r ould do, since the Emperor had expressed his desire that no offensive expedition should he undertaken during the year 1874. An announcement then appeared in the Aloscow Gazette to the effect that three companies of infantry would be des- Oeto 0 hert 874 0ftUS,N0 ' 373, datedl4th patched by sea to Chikishlar, from whence they Mr. Thomson, No. 127, dated 12 th would proceed up the Attrek River as far as a A “ gust1875 - locality called Hodji-Bayat-Olum (Baiat-Hodji- Olum or Bayat-Hajee), where they would remain till the following December to watch the movements of Turkomans. Mr. Thompson, No. 189, dated loth The position of the fort of Kara-Kala, or September 1874. Karee-Kala, now began to attract attention. Mr. Thomson had reported in September 1874 that certain Gooklan Turko mans, who had emigrated from Khiva, had established a settlement at Karee- Kala, which he described as “ an important site before it was ruined, on the Mr. Thomson, Telegraphic, dated Persian side of the Attrek;” and in Lecember 7thand sth December 1874. following he reported that General Lomakin had reached the Attrek with 600 men and two guns, and that it was believed that he would occupy Karee-Kala. Mr. Thomson added that Persia was prepared to protest against the Russians occupying any post in the interior on the line 01 the Attrek, provided she received British support in the shape of employment of remonstrances similar to those addressed to Russia in favor of Afghams- Mr. Thomson, Telegraphic, dated tan ; and he suggested that such support might he 12 th December 1874. given in favor of British interests, inasmuch as the occupation of any strategic point on the line of the Attrek meant the occupa tion, within a certain space of time, of Merve, and constant intrigues in Afghanistan. # See large Map facing page XIX.

Loftus that the expression used by General bomakin was purely accidental.” 10[ xxxvi ] A memorandum on the Attrek frontier was at the time prepared hy Sir H. Eawlinson for the use of the India Office, and India Office, dated 6th January 1875. ^ 0 |. was sen ^ Office, from which it may be useful to quote the following extracts “ Memorandum on the Attrek Frontier. There is no evidence to show that Persia has ever accepted the line of the Attrek as the northern frontier of Khorassan. What she has accepted, or rather what has been forced upon her by Russia, is an admission that the Attrek is the boundary between Russian and Persian territory on the Caspian. Rut Russia has hitherto never claimed anything beyond a zone, or margin extending along the Caspian coast, of uncertain limits, hut not exceeding at most thirty or forty miles in width. All beyond that margin has been, and still is, regarded as independent Turkoman steppe; and it was in reference to this particular tract of country that the Persian Government, in Dec ember 1869, at the same time that it acquiesced in the adoption of the Attrek as the frontier line on the sea coast, invited the Russian Minister at Teheran, M. Reger, ‘ to come to a distinct understanding as to what was to be recognized as the Persian houndary-line along the frontiers of the Turkoman country. 5 (See Mr. Thomson’s despatch, Teheran, dated 10th December 1869.) The answer to this invitation, which was, I believe, dated 29th December 1869,* has never been reported to Her Majesty’s Government; but I was told by the Grand Vizier that it was to the effect that Russia was not concerned in fixing a boundary between Persia and Turkoman territory, hut merely adhered to the Attrek as the boundary between Russia and Persia. The Grand Vizier further said that as the Perso-Turkoman boundary w r as thus left an open question, it was clear that the Attrek frontier-line could only apply to the lower course of the river, below the confluence of the Simbar or Karee-Xala branch. “It was, indeed, he added, the intention of Persia, whenever the question came on for discussion, to claim the watershed of the Attrek as the true terri torial boundary, the valley of the streams flowing from the Attrek northward belonging to the independent Tekkehs, while the valleys of the streams flowing from the Attrek southward into the Attrek were the property of the Yemoots, who were dependent on Persia. Karee-Kala on the Simbar, is one of these Yemoot settlements south of the Attrek, and belongs, therefore, to Persia. It was taken by Persian troops in 1869, and has remained tributary to Roodjnoord ever since. “ At the same time I can see no great object in Persia’s protesting against a Russian occupation of the place. Any such protest would be a mere hrutum fulmen, and would not cause a day’s delay in the march of the Russian troops if it w T as really considered of importance to garrison the post; hut why Russia should desire to occupy an isolated and badly-supplied post like Karee- Kala, when there are so many other more favorable sites, such as Kyzil-Arvad, or Kabriz, or Ashkabad, to the north of the Attrek and on the direct line from Krasnovodsk to Merve, I cannot understand. Karee-Kala is certainly of no strategical importance compared with the posts to the north of the Attrek, or with those between the Attrek and the Goorgaun. “There is, however, real danger in allowing the line of the Attrek to be recognized as the true Russo-Persian frontier, for the main stream of that river flows through the rich Monah valley, within a few miles of Roodjnoord to its souce at Shirwan, and if the right hank of this stream were ceded to Russia, she would thus be brought into the heart of Khorassan. It should, therefore, clearly be understood that the Attrek forms the frontier line only as far as the confluence of the Simbar.” * A copy of the reply was transmitted by Mr. R. Thomson in his Xo. 10 of 29th January 1873; and see Mr. T. Thomson’s No. 39 of 22nd March 1875.[ xxxvii ] On the 4th March 1875 the Emperor of Russia determined to postpone Lord a. Loftus, No. 112, dated 6th till a more favorable moment the pronoscd nom/ Vfon of a central point on the Attrek by means ot a permanent fort. This was stated to be owmo&gt; to want of funds for the construetion of a fort at Dooz-Oolama; but it w^as thought that the jealous susceptibility of England on the Russian advance on Merve had much to do with the Emperor s decision. The Emperor at the same time expressed his supreme will that nothing should occur which' could disturb the friendly relations existing between England and Russia. April 1875 Lord A. Loftus, No. 129, dated 19th April 1875. Lord A. Loftus, No. 134, dated 27th April 1875 In the despatch from the Russian Minister of War conveying these orders to the Grand Duke Michael, the following passage occurs “ Up to the present time our frontiers with Persia in the Trans-Caspian country have been fixed only with regard to the Lower Attrek; further on towards the east no frontiers exist between our Trans-Caspian possessions and the Turkoman tribes.” At the same time a proposal was made by the Grand Duke Michael to annex the southern littoral of the Caspian, but it was simply referred to the Imperial Chancellor for his consideration. On the 5th April following, Prince Gortchakoff addressed a note to Count Schouvaloff (a copy of which was communicated to Lord Derby on 11th May), and in which the following passage occurred “ Sa Majeste Imperiale n’a aucunement Tintention d’etendre les frontibres de la Russie telles qu’elles existent actuellement dans TAsie Centrale, ni du cote du Bokhara ni du cote, de Krasnovodsk et de TAtrek.” This was quite consistent with the Emperor’s special charge to Lord A.

The India Office, to whom the papers were referred, drew attention to the T r\tn . . , statement made therein to the effect that the agree- Incia Office, dated 21st June 1875. .. -n-ii itv- ment arrived at between England and Russia respecting Afghanistan left to Russia full liberty of action upon every portion of territory situated between the Russian frontiers and Afghanistan, without any apparent right of remonstrance on the part of the English Govern ment; and with reference to tin's assumption, Lord Salisbury observed as follows :—“ If this claim is allowed to pass unchallenged, it may sooner or later lead to complications affecting Indian interests with regard to Merve which may seriously embarrass Her Majesty’s Government. It must be borne in mind that the establishment of Russian supremacy in Khiva and on the south-east coast of the Caspian Sea has taken place since the course of negotiations described in the general body of the memorandum, whilst the occu pation of the Attrek districts by Russian troops may at anytime materially affect our relations with Persia.” His Lordship added that for these and other considerations it was impossi ble, in his opinion, for Her Majesty’s Government to accept the position of inaction which Prince Gortchakoff’s letter apparently wished to force upon it. Lord Derby, however, was of opinion that the reply which was to be To Lord a. Loftus, No. 318, dated returned to the Russian Government should be 25tbOctober 1875. “very civilly, as well as cautiously drawn. A memorandum was, therefore, drawn up for communication to the Russian Gov ernment in the same friendly manner in which the memorandum had been communicated by Prince Gortchakoff. In this memorandum it was stated that “ Her Majesty’s Government could not regard with indifference, and as a matter with which they had no concern, further occupation and absorption by Russia °1 the region which still separated Afghanistan from the Prussian territory , a nd, after reviewing the correspondence which passed between the two ovein- ments respecting Central Asia, it ended with these words : “Her Majesty s Government have always deprecated the further extension of Russian cm ory[ xxxviii ] towards the Afghan border, and they have now received with the most sincere satisfaction the assurances conveyed in Prince Gortchakoff s despatch as to the enlightened conviction of His Imperial Majesty that any such extension, either on the side of Bokhara, of Krasnovodsk, or of the Attrek, is contrary to Russian interests, and that general orders have been given that all future action in those regions is to be strictly confined to the defence of existing limits and the pro- tection of property and commerce from pillage and brigandage.” On this memorandum being placed in the hands of Baron Jomini by Lord Lord A. Loftus, No. 331 , dated 9 th A. Loftus, the Baron expressed his great satisfaction November 1875. at the friendly tone and the conciliatory spirit in which the sentiments of Her Majesty’s Government had been conveyed. About this time a report reached the Persian Government that the Russians Mr. Thomson, No. 57 , a.ted 22 nd were about to establish themselves on the mainland April 1875. at Gez, opposite Ashoorada, and that the points selected were Khoja Nass and Moolla Kala. The India office, dated 2 ist May 1875. position of Khoja Nass, or Nefes, is shown on the extract from Captain Napier’s map facing page 1, but the exact position of Moolla Kala is not to be found on any map that I have been able to consult, although I have reason to believe that it is in the same neighbourhood. Mr. Thomson, No. 74, dated 18th May 1875. Mr. Thomson, No. 6, dated 18th June 1875. India Office, dated 11th September 1875. In Sending me a copy of the Report of the Asterabad Agent, Mr. Thomson observed that if his statement was true it was of grave significance; and it subsequently proved to be correct, as the places above-named were carefully inspected by General Lomakin and certain Russian naval officers, the object being to ascertain if these places pos sessed such advantages as would make it desirable for Russian posts on the line of the Goorgaun and Attrek to be no longer necessary. A correspondence passed between the Russian and Persian Governments Mr. Thomson, No. 63, secret, dated on this subject, as well as upon the interference of soth April 1875. Russian authorities with the Turkoman tribes resid ing in the Attrek and Goorgaun territory, when the Persian reminded the Russian Minister of the Agreement of 13th December 1869. The Russian Minister took great offence at the wording of this letter, and another was in consequence substituted for it, wherein special reference was still made to the Agreement of 1869, as well as to the fact that the Turkoman tribes settled on the Attrek and Goorgaun were the ancient subjects of Persia. It was then reported that the Russians had landed building materials at Kvzil Soo for the purpose of constructing the fort at “Bayat Hajee”* on the Attrek, about 40 miles east of Hassun Koolie, near the embouchure of that river, to which reference has already been made (p. 16); but Mr. Thomson w r as of opinion that the erection of the fort was entirely opposed to the spirit of the so-called “arrangement” between Russia and Persia of 13th December 1869, in which it will he remembered that the Emperor, in answer to the assurance asked for by Persia that no fort or stronghold should hereafter be built at the embouchures of the Attrek or Goorgaun rivers, replied that the Russians Mr. Thomson, No 168, dated 3rd “ had no intention to construct any fort.” Never- November 1875. theless, in November 1875, it was reported that the Russians were engaged in establishing themselves at that spot, and that Moossa Khan, of the Ak tribe, with 200 families, had gone over to the Russians, which w as followed by a decree for the Chiefs of the Yemoot Turkomans of the Mr. Thomson, No. 176, dated 29 th Charva tribe, directing them to present themselves before him at Chikishlar, and there receive his orders.

In that year a- Persian force took and des troyed it, but no attempt at occupation was made —the distance and difficulty of access'heing too great to leave any hope of success in the face of the strenu ous opposition that was certain to be aroused. “ In 1869 it was again taken and destroyed after some fighting. “ Lately, after the occupation of Khiva, a colony of Gooklan, with a few Yemoots escaping from that place, rebuilt and occupied it. “ They now own a nominal allegiance to the Elkhanee, and through his influence their occupation appears to be acquiesced in by the tribes directly concerned. “ The Kussians are credited with an intention to occupy the position, on the ground that the Gooklan occupants are their subjects, being Khivans, and it is probable that they may also consider it as on their bank of the Attrek. “ The position is an important one with reference to any military move ments from the Attrek directed against the settlement of the Akhal in the ‘ Atok.’ “ Its occupation by Persia should be the first step towards an extension of authority up to the Attrek, and the opening of friendly communications with the Tekkeh Turkomans.” Page 66, dated 14th November la another plclCC he Says . 1874. “ The Gooklan refugees from Khiva settled at Karee-Kala, a fort on the Ab-i-sunts, tributary of the Attrek, about sixty miles north of Boodjnoord, said to number 1,000 families, have made overtures to the Elkhanee, and will, he says, make use of him if pressed by the Russians on the Tekkeh. Meanwhile they pay no tribute.” Again : “ A road from Goorgaun to Karee-Kala traverses the valley. This was the road most used by the Tekkeh in their raids south when they had possession of Karee-Kala.” [if these are the Akhal Tekkehs, it was before I860.] “ At the edge of the ‘ Dasht,’ on a spur of the mountain known as the Soonting Soor, or Soont Soor, stands the fort of Karee-Kala.* Its position, commanding (as it does) the only good road on to the Dasht plateau and then to the e Atok,’ has been the scene of frequent struggles between the Turkomans and Shakdilloo Koords. Some four years ago (? 1870) the Sham-u-dowla, Elkhanee, or Chief of the Shahdilloo, led a small force with a few guns against it, and succeeded in capturing it, after a siege of some days, and two unsuccess ful assaults.” Pawel07 On the 21st November 1874, Captain Napier drew special attention to the designs of Russia against Karee-Kala. He said :—“ I heard from a Turkoman, Solaiman by name, of the Kalta Terrah, who came to the caravanserai to-day, That the Russian General had given them notice to keep one camel for each family in readiness, as an expedi tion against Karee-Kala was soon to be undertaken. After the capture of Karee- Kala, he said they proposed to advance to Akhal and Merve. He also mentioned that the Tekkehs of Akhal were quite disposed to become Russian subjects, since the Persian Government had stopped their trade. And in another place he said that old accounts which he had received Pao . e 122 agreed that the road from Karee-Kala to the Atok was passable for light guns, and that the country to the west was much broken, barren and waterless. * I he latest Russian survey places the fort on the northern slopes of the mountains.—(Sd.) C. G. Napieb.It would therefore appear from these extracts that tlZ S pL a it P !l rS ?f. Ver t ° J h^^occupied^it TnToten “ England and Hussia times . Nevertheless, Sir H. Eawlinsoa appears to be of oplXn that t“e fort belongs to ner. The following is an extract from his work entitled Page 342 . in the East,” published in 1875. “As these last sheets are passing through the press, it’ is announced that operations have commenced, the Russian column from Chikishlar bavin- appeared on the Attrek, with the avowed intention of attacking and occupvin- Yemoot post of Karee-Kala, on the Simbar, which is the most westernly affluent of the Attrek on its right bank. This demonstration then raises the frontier question in a direct and tangible form. Persia maintains her frontier to be marked not by the mam stream, hut by the watershed of the Attrek the valleys of all the affluents of that river from the north, of which the Simbar often called the Karee-Kala, is one, belonging to her, and the Yemoots, who inhabit those valleys, being accounted her subjects. “ If Russia overrule this claim, and insist on her right to regard the main stream from its embouchure to its source as the boundary between Russian and Persian territory, the Shah will lose some of the fairest districts of Khorassan, and Russia will command not only the Attrek road to Merve, hut the high road to Meshed from the Caspian. “Of course the protest of Persia against what she calls a violation of frontier would be unavailing unless warmly supported by England; and Russia does not seem disposed to admit of our right of interference in such a matter.” In April 1876 a proposal was made by the Grand Duke Michael to the Lord A. Loftns, No. 145 . most Emperor of Russia that General Lomakin should secret, dated i4th April 1876. undertake another expedition to the Attrek during Aprn r i 876 LoftUS ’ 151 ’ dated ^ ie ensu i n g summer, but His Majesty positively forbade any such expedition to be undertaken, pos sibly on account of Count Schouvaloff having reported to His Imperial Majesty and the Russian Government that, although the annexation of Khokand had produced no notable impression on public opinion in England, yet that any extension on the right hand from the Caspian towards the Persian and Afghanistan frontiers wreuld be very differently viewed, and that any advance on the Attrek, or towards Merve, would immediately give rise to action on the part of the Indian Government. The following tracing from Kiepert’s Map of Turkestan shows what he considers to be the present boundary of Persia:— Kiepert's Turkestan 1876 bnlarsedThe question of the Attrek, or northern frontier of Persia, appears then to stand thus :— In 1834 Great Britain and Bussia entered into an agreement to respect Confidential Memorandum, No. 2150 . the independence and integrity of Persia. In 1838 this agreement was confirmed. In 1842 the Russians, with the avowed object of assisting the Persians against the Turkomans, occupied the Island of Ashoorada, near Asterabad, to the south of the River Goorgaun, and erected buildings on the island. In 1845 they increased their buildings, when the Persians remonstrated against their doing so. In 1846 it became evident that the Russians intended to form a military establishment at Ashoorada, their object being, it was believed, to entice the Turkomans towards the Russian Government, and to detach them from Persia. Thev then attempted to establish themselves in the mainland opposite Ashoorada, and asked the Persians to allow them to build a hospital there, and to surround the building and store-houses with a wall; but the Persians, on beino’ cautioned by the British Minister that such a building would be in reality a fortress, they withheld their consent. In 1849 the British Government informed the Russian Government that they thought the time had arrived for restoring Ashoorada to the Persians; but it has never been restored to this day. In 1853 the Russians were engaged for fifteen days in surveying the whole line of coast of the Bay of Ashoorada. In 1854 the Persians were about to repair their fortifications at Enzelee, near Resht, and at Gez, near Asterabad; but the Russians remonstrated, and they consequently deferred doing so, although the British Government urged the Persian Government to put Asterabad and Enzelee in a state of defence. At this time the Russian Charge d’Affaires at Teheran admitted that Ashoorada belonged to Persia. After the Crimean w r ar Russia increased her naval force in the Caspian, and Mr. Abbott pointed out to Her Majesty’s Government how this step could only he regarded in the light of a menace to Central Asia and British India, as the* best route into Afghanistan was through Asterabad. In 1865 the Russian Government proposed to Persia to make the Attrek River the boundary of Persia, on the shores of the Caspian, in lieu ot the Koja- Su, which was stated to he more to the south, and had hitherto been the recog nized frontier. In 1869 the Russians took possession of Kyzil-Soo, or Krasnovodsk, in Balkan Bay, with the avowed object of opening a route to Khiva and Turkestan in the interest of commerce. The Persians remonstrated, and claimed the coast as belonging to them, hut the Russian Minister at Teheran asserted that Persia had no territorial rights on the shore of the Caspian Sea so far north; and on the 13th December following an agreement was come to between Russia and Persia that the Attrek should form the boun dary between their respective States in their neighbourhood, and that no Russian forts should be erected on the Attrek. In 1872 the Russians invaded Akhal, belonging to the Turkomans, and captured Kyzil-Arvad, Barne, and Berma, and it ■was reported they had taken Karee-Kala also, which is claimed by Persia, with the intention of fortifying it. In 1873 the Russians, notwithstanding the Agreement of 1869, erected a Pao . e g fort to the north of the Attrek River near its mouth, called Chikishlar; they also crossed the Attrek and attacked the Yemoot Turkomans ; but on the Persians protesting, the Russians said they fully recognized “ the Attrek as the frontier between Page 7.Russia and Persia,’ but a doubt has now been raised as to whether the A°ree- ment of 1869 had icfeience to that part of the river which empties itself into the Caspian Sea, or to the river along its whole extent; and this again has led to another question, as that is what are the real sources of the Attrek. When the discussion on this latter point first arose in 1873, the Russian Pages 5 and n. Asiatic Society re-issued their map of Central Asia ol lobo, with the colouring altered, so as to show the boundary between Prussia and Persia as extending for a distance of about forty or fifty miles up the river Attrek, but not so far as Karee-Kala. In 1871 the Russians claimed jurisdiction over the districts to the south of the Attrek, and lying between that river and the Goorgaun ; but so recently as November of that year the British Government informed the Russian Government PaCTe 23 the territory lying between the Attrek and the Goorgaun was unquestionably Persian territory. In the same year the Russians came to a secret understanding among them- Pacre 25 selves to consider all the territory lying between Khiva and the Attrek as annexed to Russia, al though they do not publicly avow.it; and they would now appear to be again considering the question of obtaining a footing on the mainland, either at Moolla Kala or at Khoja Nefes, or at both, their chief object being to force from the Persians an admission that the Attrek forms the boundary between Persia and Russia from its source (wherever that may be) to the Caspian Sea. But as great doubts exist as to what is really the source of that river, Persia might find herself deprived not only of some of her most fertile districts, but also of her most important defensive positions, including Karee-Kala, which she firmly maintains belongs to her, were she to consent to the Russian proposals ; and from the latest accounts it appears that the Russians have evident designs of occupying Karee-Kala. But, notwithstanding these proceedings of Russia at Ashoorada, Kyzil-Soo, Ghikishlar, Hajee-Bayat, Karee-Kala and else- Confidentiai Memorandum, No. 2464 w j ierej s p e p as assured the British Government, so recently as July 1873 and December 1874, that she considers the Agreement entered into with the British Government in 1834, which was confirmed in 1838, to maintain the independence and integrity of Persia, to be still binding; and the point, therefore, which has to be determined is, what is considered.by this country, by Persia, and by Russia, as the north boundary of Persia ? Until some arrangement is come to on this point, the discussion is likely to be interminable.APPENDIX IV. [Referred to in paragraph 51, Chapter 77.] REPOET BY MR, RONALD THOMSON ON THE TURKOMAN TRIBES OCCUPYING DISTRICTS BETWEEN THE CASPIAN AND THE OXUS, DATED TEHERAN, 29th FEBRUARY 1876. The military operations recently undertaken by the Russians from Krasnovodsk and the mouth of the Attrek, and the presumption that these operations in the direction of Merve will be renewed before long, induce me to submit to Government^ as a portion of my general report, the result of the information relative to the above tribes, which I have recently obtained from what may be considered the best native sources. The country inhabited by the Turkomans lies to the north of Persia and Herat between the Caspian Sea and the Oxus. The important tribes inhabiting that region are the follow- i n g. : —Choudours, Yemoots, Goklans, Tekkes, Aleilees, Saryks, Salors, Ersarees. The various branches and subdivisions of these tribes; the strength of each, given approximately but, I believe, with sufficient accuracy; the districts in which they dwell; the names of their present Chiefs; and the strongholds they possess, are noted in the accompanying Table (No. 1). The Choudours number about 8,000 tents, or 40,000 souls. They occupy the country between Mangishlak on the Caspian and Khiva. The Yemoots inhabit the land on both banks of the Attrek, and as far to the north of that river as Balkhan and Krasnovodsk. They number altogether about 30,000 tents, or 150,000 souls. Of these 12,000 families inhabit the Attrek region, and 18,000 families dwell on the left bank of the Oxus, in the territory of Khiva. The Goklans occupy the country on the Gurgan River, extending from near Asterabad eastwards to the district of Boojnoord in Khorassan, a distance of 75 miles in length by 20 miles in breadth. Their numbers have been over-estimated in some recent reports, having been given at 12,000 and even 30,000 families. They numbered some years ago 6,000 families, but they have since decreased, and at present they do not exceed 4,000 families, or 20,000 souls. They are not strictly nomads. The richness of the soil in the Gurgan country enables them to raise large quantities of grain, and silk is cultivated by them also to a consi derable extent. * They pay 7,000 tomans (2,800^.) annually as tribute to the Persian Government. The tribute nominally is double this amount, but one-half is remitted under the name of allowances granted by the Shah to their Chiefs. The Goklan tribute is paid to the Governor of Astera bad through the Chief of Boojnoord. The Tekke is the most important tribe among the Turkomans. Originally it occupied the territory in which now the Akhal branch alone is found. But their numbers having increased to such an extent that there was no longer space'for them on the line of the Attrek, they divided: 25,000 families, or 125,000 souls, remaining there, and 24,000 families, or 120,000 souls, proceeding eastwards, forcibly dispossessed the Saryk and Salor tribes of the Merve territory, which they have since continued to occupy. Of the Aleilees there are only 3,000 families, or 15,000 souls. Several encampments of this tribe are to be found on the mountain slopes to the north of Deragez and Khelat, where they cultivate the soil to a limited extent, paying 10 per cent, in kind on the produce to the Persian Chiefs of these districts. The remaining portion of the tribe inhabit lands situated to the east of the Moorghab River. The Saryks and Salors having been expelled, as already stated, from Merve, proceeded south and established themselves in the districts of Penjdeh, Maroochak, and Bala Moorghab, on the Moorghab River, from Y^oleten, which is eight fursakhs, or 32 miles south of Merve, to the territory of Herat. The Saryks number 10,000 tents, or 50,000 souls. The Salors do not exceed 5,000 families, or 25,000 souls. The Ersaree Turkomans occupying the left bank of the Oxus from Charjui on to Khiva, are said to number about 30,000 tents, or 150,000 souls. Their principal wealth is in camels, and they are the great carriers of merchandize between Khiva, Bokhara, Balkh, Kholm, Andkhoi, Seripol, Meimeneh, Shiberghan, and other places.® ® til i(!;t ! t:;? ! years a»j p ; id krilki re a also to i® or isiijW 118 ' &gt; ]ler?e t®?

There are two routes by which a Russian force mav arlvnn™ oi the Attek Hills in the direction of Merve, one bein^ from lon £ the nort hern slope of Balkhan to Kizl Ervad, which is the first Tekke encampment bj Way ° f the Akhal territory, and 130 miles from the Caspian • and the othm- f ^ . e 1 xtremit y the Hajee Beiyat and Meshed Misrian to Kizl E™d ol from Hale R f 1 **^ V “7 «« thence to Kizl Ervad. ’ 1 tr ° m Ha J ee Bei J rat to Kavee Kala, and By the Balkhan road, the water supply is dependent upon wells Rv tho , lt i an abundant supply derived from the Attrek and one of ' ,ni “ f e other there is situated.

This stream contains about 10 sengs* of water Not long ago Karee Kala was in the possession of the Persians, but they were mable to rotate C:2foA:;Vlmi n i?eI. OCCUP,edby tbe y Khivan t^t From Karee Kala it is nine fursakhs, or 36 miles to KiVl xi n , * occupied by the Akhal branch of the Tekkes, on the 4ad from the Caspkn towarfl ifevl These Turkomans inhabit the district known by the name of the Attek a fertile W of land situated on the northern slopes of the Elboorz mountain range, which divides KhoraLn r i_ A •{■'nrri 1^1 1 ' rl t 10IH to sixteen miles broad, and extends from Kizl Ervad eastwards to Anow and Gavers, a distance of about 150 miles. It is watered by numerous streams descending from the ravines in the mountain range and where the cultivation ceases, the Choi, or desert, commences. This desert during the spring months affords a nutritious pasture, and while the season lasts a portion of each of the tribes descends to the plains to feed their flocks and cattle, while the rest remain in their permanent settlements above. An abundant supply of fuel may be obtained from the desert itseff, as m many parts there are extensive tracts of Tak jungle. This tree grows to the height of about 12 feet, and is of so dry a nature and so brittle that the trunks may he easily snapped and when lighted it burns readily with a clear flame, and almost without smoke. The various tnbes of the Akhals, the important branches of which are mentioned in the accompanyino- fable (No. 1), have their permanent camps within the limits of the irrigated lands. Near the camp are generally to be found mud-wall enclosures, called by the Turkomans kelateks or kalas, intended for shelter and protection against sudden attacks. These afford no defence, however, unless against predatory horse without guns. Even for that they are not always efficient, and in the event of the attacking force being a large one, they would not seek shelter in the kelatehs, but would make off for the desert at once. &amp; Kizl Ervad is occupied by the Yekeel tribe of Akhals, under Ata Nezr Beg, formino- an encampment of 1,000 families. Thence to Bamee is about five fursakhs, or twenty miles, and there the Beg tribe is encamped, numbering 500 tents. Two fursakhs, or eight miles, east of Bamee is Boormeh, under Evez Morad Takkmeh, of the Seechmez tribe. Three fursakhs, or twelve miles further on, is Archemen, where the Dasheiyaks have a camp under Noor Mahomed Serdar, and 16 miles beyond Archemen is Beherzen, also occupied by Dasheiyaks. Sixteen miles thence is Dooroon, occupied partly by Begs and partly by Vekeels. Four miles beyond Dooroon is Karakhan, where there is a Yekeel camp, of which Berdee- keer is the Chief. From this point the country to the eastward is a waste for four fursakhs (sixteen miles). It is without water, and there are no camps till the districts of Ak Tuppeh, Meheen, Yarejee, and Guk Tuppeh are reached. At Ak Tuppeh camps belonging to the Tolkee branch of the Vekeel tribe are situated under Kol Bater, Jevan Igdir, and Borjak Sultan. South of Ak Tuppeh, towards the hills, and two miles distant from them, are several kelatehs, or walled villages, one of which belongs to Noor Verdy Khan and another to Kordee Baee. Both of these are occupied by the Vekeel Turkomans. They pay tribute to the Persian Government in the shape of a carpet and a camel, presented annually to the Chief of Koochan, in order to secure themselves from attack or reprisals on the part of the Persians. They abstain from making raids on Persian territory. i Persia , running water is measured by the number of sengs or stones, this term having originally, been mp oyed with reference to the quantity required to turn a millstone.

Prom Guk Tuppeh onwards is the district of Akhan, which extends for six miles in length and three miles in breadth, where there are numerous encampments of the Vekeel tribe. The water which supplies both Guk Tuppeh and the district of Akhal comes from the Germab River, which passes through Yangee Kala. This river, when it reaches Akhal, is called by the Turkomans Sekkez Yah from its being divided into eight streams, four of which pass through Akhal and four go to Guk Tuppeh. All the water of these streams is expended in the cultivation of the fields belonging to the There are from 2,000 to 3,000 tents of Yekeel Akhals in this one district. Here also are several small kelatehs, about four miles from the hills. They are named the langee Relateh, and are occupied by the Yekeel and Seechmez tribes. Quite close to Akhal, to the east, is the Feeroozeh^ Stream, called by the Turkomans the ' Altec Yah, or Six Streams, flowing from Karkalik and Kozlok, where the Konkor branch of the Beo- tribe is encamped to the number of 300 tents. ^ The Feeroozeh Stream flows from the village of that name, occupied by the Perso- Turkoman race known as Donook, and situated near the top of the pass leading from Khorassan over the mountain range, and near the elevated peak called the Choopan. On the Feeroozeh water, about four miles east of Akhal, is the fort of Izkend, occupied by the Vekeel tribe under Noor Verdy Khan. To the south of this, near the hills, there are camps belonging to the Beg tribe, numbering about 1,000 tents. There are other forts also this district which all belong to the Begs, amongst which are Yirnshan Kala, Shoor Kala, and Kala Allah Verdy Sheikh. There are about 4,000 to 5,000 tents here altogether. From Izkend it is sixteen miles to the district of Nissa, which belongs to the Dasheiyaks. Here there are the remains of an old town, which was once a place of considerable importance, and the chief place of the district. Nissa is the strongest position the Akhals have, the tort is nearly a ruin now, hut could be repaired. It is built on a mound, and its earthworks are fifty feet hig:h. The stream flows outside, and is a fine and copious spring ot water inside, ana it would hold about 3,000 men. The water in this district is from hill streams one of whic has twenty sengs of water. The Turkomans captured the place and established themselves m it, at the time when the dynasty of the Suffiaveans terminated. There are other Turkoman forts at Nissa, one of which is called Bagher, and belongs to Kereem Verdy Keshan, ana another named Meerabeh. The tribe pay a tribute to Persia of one camel, in proot ot having engaged to abstain from act of plundei. Herzeh Kala, also occupied by Dasheiyaks, is a very short distance from Izkend. Kipchak, where the Beg tribe encamp with 1,000 tents, is eight miles from Izken eastwards. _ . , Gukcheh, the encampment of the Gukcheh tribe, of which Bairam Ali Meigen is Chief, is six miles on from Kipchak. At Gooshee, seven miles further to the east, are encampments of Beg and erne Turkomans. . Thence to Ashkabad is six miles. This is a walled fort, 400 yards by 200, u i is partially ruined and out of repair. Some tents are inside the walls, but the enca “P m , outside and beyond the adjacent gardens and vineyard. The Vekeels are established here Aman Koolee Serdar, Karom Beggee, and Pashee Serdar. * * Khakreez.[ xlvii ] Anow is eight miles beyond Ashkabad.

Those of the Akhal possess only one piece of artillery, which the; took from Jaffer Koolee Khan, Shadillo, fifteen years ago, when they defeated him at Karee Kala Thev have workmen among them who can repair thoroughly their rifles and guns, and can even make nUe barrels, and amongst the Tekkes of Merve they have learned to make percussion locks and now nearly all their flint guns have beeen altered and fitted with these. They make o^od gunpowder, and the percussion caps and other ammunition required are obtained from Khiva and Bokhara. The Tekke Turkomans of Merve possess twenty-eight pieces of artillery. Pour of these were taken from the Khan of Khiva, and twenty-four were captured from the Persians in 1861 . In the event of war with a powerful enemy, the Tekkes of Merve and Akhal would mutually assist each other, but the latter, having a large extent of country to defend, could not furnish a contingent of more than 1,000 horse; while the former, if not attacked from Bo khara at the same time that the Akhal country was threatened, could furnish 3,000. The Tekkes of Akhal appear to have formed a plan of operations for themselves in the event of their being attacked by a .Russian force, which is to leave garrisons in Kizl Ervad and Boormeh, and having withdrawn their encampments to Guk Tuppeh or other suitable places further east, to assemble their horse, and by sudden attacks on their exposed points endeavour to cut off the Russian supplies and communications. Noor Verdy Khan is considered by the Turkomans the best man they have - to lead them m such an emergency. He is about fifty years of age, strong and active, and, being of a very determined character, has acquired great influence over all the branches of the Tekke tribes, both in the Attek and at Merve. I may mention here that, besides the passes noted in the annexed paper, there are three leading from the Akhal country into Persia which are practicable for artillery—the Kaplan Keiya, the Khormend or Kozlok, and the Anow defiles. On the southern side of the Attek Hills are a number of villages mostly ruined, but which are well supplied with water and all that is requisite to make the region productive and valuable. These begin with Chunder and Soont, where there is a good stream; then Karee Kala, now in the hands of the Goklans; next, Khojeh Kalasse, between Karee Kala and Kizl Ervad and Bend Hassan. Beyond Bend Hassan, proceeding eastward, is the village of Nokhor, where 500 Toork families reside. They are not loyal to Persia, and are in league with the Turkomans, to whom % convey speedy intelligence when any Persian expedition is directed against them, and whose raids in Khorassan they facilitate as much as possible. The next eight villages are likewise in ruins. They are Keraee, Khojeh Kalasse (second of this name), Kala Boogdebaee, Koolar Meshedee, Daeeneb, Rastighan, Saook Soo, and Aiab kalasse, which is opposite the kelateh of Noor Verdy Khan on the Akhal side. 13i# [ xlviii ] Kaz had 1 000 families of Persian troops residing in it, but they were driven out hy the Turkomans and the place is now wholly abandoned, though it is an important position for the Persians being- a place close to the Akhal country, where Persian expeditions could halt and rest their horses and having obtained local intelligence, make a descent on the Turkoman encampment without their presence in the vicinity being known or suspected. Another village has now been built further back towards Boojnoord, two miles to the north of the Attrek, opposite Maneh, and the remnant of the Raz inhabitants are established there. It was called Kcdoo Now Deh at first, but its name has recently been altered to Mahomedabad. In it are 800 families. Further east is Kolkolab, now inhabited by sixty Arab families, who were driven out of the place previously named as Arab Kalasse; then Germab, occupied by fifty Arab and fifty Toork families; and Kozlok, the stream from which flows to the north into the Akhal country, and two villages called Feroozeh, inhabited by Toorks and Koorks, 100 families in each. The stream from these two latter places also runs to the north to the Guk Tuppeh district of the Akhal Turkomans. The principal village of the district of Koosh Khaneh is Yangee Kala, but it has lost its former importance, and has only thirty families now, whereas formerly it had 200. The other four villages of Koosh Khaneh are Eezrnan, with fifty Toork families; Keefan 1,000 families of Tats or Persians; and Kilkillab. The districts of Maneh and Germeh Khan on the Upper Attrek, belonging to Boojnoord are both hot and unhealthy in summer, rice being cultivated there, but Semilkhan, being at a higher elevation, is more healthy. The Koordish tribes transplanted by tbe Suffaveans into Khorassan were the Zafferanloo, 6,000 families; Keiwanloo, 6,000 families; Khordeh Oimak, 6,000 families; Shadilloo, 3,000 families. The three first were established in Koochan, Chenaran, Radkan, and other districts along the Turkoman border, and the last, the Shadilloo, at and near Boojnoord. These tribes have^ it is said, doubled their numbers, and are now estimated by one of their Chiefs at 42,000 families or 210,000 souls. A number of these occupying the villages lying between the Akhal country and the dis tricts of Boojnoord, Koochan, and Chenaran have intermarried with the Turkomans, and are not to be trusted as loyal Persian subjects. They are in the habit of giving information to the Turkomans, and of conniving at their plundering excursions and raids into Persian territory. Those who are of this race are called Donooks, as mentioned elsewhere. It may be assumed that the Russians will march upon Merve, and that their first object will be to secure for themselves a strong position in the Akhal country, somewhere near its eastern extremity, there to await a further advance by way of Serekhs, or an attack on Merve from Bokhara. From Serekhs to Merve is at present a dry desert, but water might be conveyed by a small canal from the Tejjen River at Serekhs to the immediate vicinity of the Moorghab River at Merve, as was done to Koocheh Kom, which is half the distance, and only eight fursakhs from the Moorghab, by the Persian troops under the Hishmet-et-Dowleh, when he advanced upon Merve in 1861, and was defeated by the Turkomans. The soil everywhere around Merve is most fertile, and an abundant supply of water is available for irrigation at all seasons from the Moorghab. It is conveyed from the river over the adjacent lands by a large canal, called the Karayab, and by other smaller channels. The tract of land which may thus be brought under cultivation is capable of producing grain sufficient for the support of a much larger population than now exists in that locality. In the Russian map published at St. Petersburgh in 1873, the line of the Persian frontier —as if with a view to future events in these regions—is laid down as extending from Hassan Koolee, at the mouth of the Attrek, along the line of that river to the north of Boojnoord and south of Deragez, which is excluded from the Persian territory, although it is under the direct rule and authority of the Shah. It is, in fact, placed about twelve miles outside of the Persian boundary. Khelat is placed, about ten miles within the Persian boundary line. Serekhs, which has a Persian garrison of 500 men and four guns, is also excluded from Persia by twelve miles, and the Persian frontier is then taken south, in a straight line almost, to within 60 miles of Herat. The frontier of Afghanistan is then carried due east for 80 miles, and after that it passes to the north and east until it reaches the Oxus at Khojeh Saleh. The Russians, consequently, once at Merve, will be in occupation of all the country which, according to their maps, is neither Persian nor Afghan territory, and that will bring them to within 25 miles of the city of Herat and 20 miles of the town of Meimeneh. The lurkomans, and especially those located near the Persian frontier, have, by their atrocities, deservedly acquired for themselves an infamous reputation in these countries. They are not only relentless marauders, but, when their enemies are not of the Soonnee Mahomedan faith, inveterate men stealers and slave dealers, treating their captives, when too old for the market, or too young to be anything but an incumbrance, with the greatest brutality.But, on the other hand, it must be admitted that the comiter-foravs made hv p • into the Turkoman country, are mostly conducted in the same ruthless snirit and th f erS '“ s en^m actual hostilities, there is little to choose between the two as Regards^he crudties The Turkomans are not devoid of good qualities however. Theft from each other is unknown Chiefs, elders, and tribesmen all live on a footing of perfect equality. Their (Sth in each other's honesty is so great, that when money is borrowed by one from another receints are not given or required and a man of good repute amongst them would rather lose his monev than dispute the amount he had to receive They pay no taxes. Those who possess horses receive a share of the water belonging to the tribe used for irrigation, proportionate with the number o£ animals they own. When on plundering excursions, the Turkomans pay the most implicit obedience to their leaders. one thinks ot disputing or questioning the decision taken by the Chief on any point whatever so long as the expedition lasts, and they are invariably conscientious and scrupulously honest in delivering up for even-handed allotment and distribution every article which has been secured during the expedition. J When they return every man gets his share, and if any of the party have been killed their shares are set aside, and conveyed to their families through the elders of the tribe. An instance may be given of their scrupulousness with respect to booty. When the Persian army was defeated at Merve in 1861, the jewelled decorations and the jewelled sword of the Prince Commander fell into the hands of an old Turkoman, one of the crowd pourino- into the deserted camp for plunder, and these were at once taken by him intact to those in charge of the booty. On the same occasion two Turkoman women found 7,000 tomans in the tumbril of one of the Persian abandoned guns, and the whole of this sum, without a coin being abstracted, was carried by them to the Chiefs tent. Turkomans, although they do not rashly expose their lives when on marauding expedi tions, still meet death fearlessly and with a degree of composure which is remarkable even amongst Mahomedans. I have entered into these details with respect to the Turkomans in order to show that they are not altogether the irreclaimable savages they are described to be by the Eussians and other writers; that, on the whole, amongst themselves, they lead an orderly and peaceable life; that if they constantly pillage the districts of Khorassan, ill-treat and kill their prisoners, or carry them into captivity and slavery, they have been brought up to look upon this as legiti mate warfare, to which, if they subject the Persians, the latter also in their turn subject them; that unlike most other Asiatics professing Islamism, and notably those in the Caucasus, and the natives of Bokhara and the Central Asian States, they are not intolerant fanatics; that they are an extremely hardy race; and that, in the habits and character of the Turkomans generally, there are elements which show that they might in the presence of a powerful and civilized Government, become peaceable neighbours without their actual subjection being requisite, but that, in the event of their being brought under the Russian rule, they are likely to become before long a colony of Cossacks, who would prove themselves formidable and danger ous enemies to any troops against whom they may be properly equipped and led.

THOMSON ON THE YEMOOT AND GOKLAN TURKOMANS, DATED 23kd APRIL 1876. The Mission Agent at Asterabad having been referred to for detailed information on certain points connected with the Yemoot Turkomans on and near the Attrek and Gurgan Rivers, has reported in substance as follows :— The Yemoot encampments extend from the Caspian coast at Goomish Tuppeh, on the right bank of the northern embouchure of the Gurgan, and from Khojeh Nefess, on the left bank of the southern outlet of that river, to Gombed Kaoos, a distance of twenty fursakhs or 80 miles, from west to east. From south to north they occupy the lands on both banks of the Gurgan and Attrek Rivers, and the tract of country lying between these two streams, which are fife fursakhs, or twenty miles apart on the sea-coast, and gradually diverge so as to increase the distance intervening up to Gombed Kaoos, where there are 12 fursakhs, or 48 miles between the two rivers. At the embouchure of the Gurgan the distance between the northern outlet at Goomish Tuppeh and the southern channel at Khojeh Nefess is one fursakh, or four miles. Amongst the Yemoots those tribes possessing herds or camels are called Choomoors, and they dwell in fixed camps. Those two possess cattle and horses and flocks are called Charwas, and they are always moving about, changing their camps for summer and winter, and visiting for pasturage localities north of the Attrek as far as Balkhan in one direction, and in the other eastwards as far as Karee Kala, which is 28 fursakhs, or 112 miles, distant from Boojnoord. The Charwas keep more to the north towards the Attrek. For a considerable part of the year they are away in the Balkhan and Misrian districts and some of their camps move on to near Kizl Ervad and the Akhal country, but they all return during the harvest season to the Attrek and Gurgan districts for thr purpose of reaping and storing their grain. The Cho- moors do not quit the Gurgan lands on both banks of that river, but some of them bring their camps quite close to the Asterabad jungle in the winter, and withdraw again to their usual localities during the summer months. The amount of revenue payable by these tribes is 2,100 tomans, equal to 840/. annually. If the provincial administration at Asterabad were good, 5,000 tomans might be exacted without difficulty, for it is calculated that the Chomoors number 8,000 families, or 40,000 ssuls, and that the Charwas of the Yemoots number 12,000, or 60,000 souls; so that if even 10,000 of them are away beyond the Attrek and out of reach of the Persian authorities, 10,000 still remain within the Persian territory but the fact is that the Governor is seldom in a position to enforce payment of even 1,000 tomans of the tribute claimed.The six Sheref Yemoot tribes above mentioned are never on good terms amongst them- selves and they are frequently at open warfare with the Atabaees of the Choonee tribe. The Jafferbaees beino- nearer to and amongst the Russians on the Attrek are, more than any of the other Yemoots disposed to put themselves under Russian subjection, and many of them have already 2 -one over to that Government. All those who come down from the Khivan territory are without exception, Russians. The principal Chief of the Jafferbaee Yemoots is Geldee Khan He and his son may be considered as the Turkoman agents of the Russian Com- mander for they are both in his pay, and his humble servants. They belong to the Arikh branch if the Jalferbaees. The districts occupied by the latter extend from the mouth of the Gurwan right away to the Balkhan, and through the Atadagh and Senodagh, up to the lands adiacent to Kizl Ervad. There is also in the same tribe another Chief, named Deria Koolee Khan, who likewise is in Russian pay, and has a number of Russian decorations. The Jaffer- baees have small boats, with which they trade to some extent along the coast. As the principal tribe of the Sheref Yemoots is the Jafferbaee, so the most important tribe of the Choonee (Cholyoonee) division is the Atabaee. Moossa Khan, who is the Chief of 300 families of the Ak branch of that tribe, has also gone over to the Russians, and is now in hio-h favour with General Lomakin, who has granted him a fixed annual salary. During the last year he received 1,000 tomans. He and Geldee Khan and his son do their utmost to induce the other tribes to place themselves under Russian protection. The Turkomans, too, are a very mercenary people, and the Russians spend money freely amongst them. There are two Balkhans. One, the Little Balkhan, is on the road to Khiva from the Gurgan. It is a hilly district, and is supplied with water from artificial wells, there being no running streams between the provinces of Asterabad and Krasnovodsk, except the Attrek and Gurgan rivers. There is an immense quantity of game all through the Balkhans, such as ibex^ mouflon, antelopes, and the shooka (a small species of deer), and the gavkohee, or nylgav, or maral. The Great Balkhan is further east, towards Kizl Ervad, whence it is only eight fursakhs distant. It is a district nearly twenty fursakhs in length and eight in breadth, with hills all around, and two entrances, one to the north and the other to the south. Pomegranates, figs, and vines grow there in quantities. Bauyir is a district above Misrian, ten fursakhs in length and four fursakhs wide. It is a healthy and fertile locality, and there is no more desirable place in all the Turkoman country in this region. In former times there was a canal from the Attrek which passed though Bauyir on to Misrian, where there was a great deal of cultivation, and now the Russians are about to reconstruct the dyke on the river, and carry the water to fertilize the Misrian lands. From Asterabad to Boojnoord, by Nardeen, is 61 fursakhs ; Kooleeabad, four; Kotool, three; Finderisk, four; Nowdeh, four; Chinashek, six; Seebchah, five; Nardeen, five; Seng Sellah, five; Jajerm, three ; Dereh, ten ; Sankhass, three; Boojnoord, seven. Nardeen to Karee Kala, 30 fursakhs; Chakir (Goklan Camp), seven; Yiukak, five; Kirkh Kiz, six; Kara Chundee, seven; Karee Kala, five. Asterabad to Beiyat Hajee, eleven fursakhs; Ak Kala, three; Beiyat Hajee, eight. Asterabad to Meshed Misrian, twenty fursakhs; Gurgan, three; Attrek, seven; Bekdillee, five; Misrian, five. Asterabad to Kizl Ervad, 43 fursakhs; Gurgan, three; Attrek, seven; Bekdillee, five; Misrian, five ; Chayirlee, eight; Balkhan, twelve; Kizl Ervad, three. Asterabad to Krasnovodsk, fifty fursakhs. Asterabad to Karee Kala, 27; Ak Kala, three; Atrek, seven; Bekdillee, five; Keltooee three ; Meshed Boosem, five ; Karee Kala, four. Hussein Koolee, mouth of Attrek, to Kizl Ervad, 33 fursakhs. Hussein Koolee to Misrian, twelve fursakhs. The Gurgan River has four times the quantity of water that the Attrek has; but it is mostly muddy, whereas the Attrek stream runs clear.

The Trans-Caspian regions up to the last few years, were a blank space on all maps and m could form no just notion of the condition, the inhabitants, and the history of these vTst regions, which, nevertheless, have played an important part in the annals of Asiatic history This void is now beginning to be supplied, thanks to the progress of the Russian arms brought about as much by political combinations as by considerations of a more elevated character, which induce Russia to sacrifice a considerable portion of her material and intellec tual resources for the object of making known to the world forgotten countries and races and to carry the germs of civilization to peoples whom circumstances of a historical political or physical nature, have hitherto kept in complete isolation. ' ^ ' Since the year of the occupation of Krasnovodsk, viz., 1869, the trans-Caspian districts have been traversed in every direction by Russian detachments. In the train and under the protection of the military force, men of science have endeavoured t® explore this terra incognita One of the first places in the list of these men must be given to Colonel Stebnitzky, Chief of the Topographical Department of the Caucasus, whose wanderings in the track of the Russian detachments in 1873 have furnished an abundant harvest of trustworthy and scientifically exact data respecting the country of the Turkomans. * y The more recent expeditions of the columns from Krasnovodsk, and more especially the marches of General Lomakin in 1875, have added new and valuable details to the previous information. The present sketch is intended to review the state of the Turkoman Steppe in 1865, as it appears from the reports of General Lomakin, a portion of which were published in the Invalids Russe ; it recapitulates, at the same time, the principal geographical data furnished by M. Stebnitzky in the diary of his journey.f GENERAL ASPECT OP THE TURKOMAN STEPPE AND ITS INHABITANTS. Generally speaking, the following physical conditions and configuration are presented in the Turkoman Steppe. The Uzboi, or dried-up bed of the Oxus, constitute the lowest lying portion, which extends from the Caspian Sea (the Gulf of Balkhan) to the present course of the Amu Darya. The Great Balkhan, a rocky elevation of 5,450 feet above the level of the Caspian, a western ramification of which extends as far as Krasnovodsk along the northern shore of the Gulf of Balkhan, bounds this district and marks its direction from the (old) mouth (of the river) in the Gulf as far as the well of Buyurudji. To the north of the Great Balkhan is a vast sandy plain, named Chil-Mamed-Kum, which comes close to the Uzboi, and forms its boundary from the most easterly slopes of the Great Balkhan to beyond the well of Dektcha. Beyond this are the last outlying elevations of the Ust-Urt plateau, called here Boguraslan-kir, which border the ancient bed of the Oxus on the north, and run by the side of it as far as Igdy, at a more or less varying distance from it. No doubt, even beyond Igdy as far as the lake or Betandali-gol near Sary Kamysh, the slopes of the Ust-Urt are to be found bordering the course of the Uzboi. Its general direction, throughout its course of nearly 1,000 versts, may be summarised as follows:—Prom the Amu Darya to Dekteha and Sary Kamysh, from east to west; from Sary Kamysh to Igdy, from N.N.E. to S.S.W.; from Igdy to the Gulf of Balkhan, in a westerly direction with a decidedly southerly trending, caused by the Great Balkhan mountain chain. South of this low country, which bounds the Turkoman Steppe on the north, immense sandy deserts, some of which are 100 versts in breath, extend as far as the valley of the Tekkes, known under the name of Arkatch, which, stretching from north-west to south-east, is situated at the foot of the northern slope of the •Kurendagh. This expanse of sand extends to the east as far as the Amu Darya, encroaches upon the oasis of Khiva, and stretches south along the Oxus up to the ancient frontiers of Bokhara. * The journey of Colonel Stebnitazy was made during the months of August to December 1872, m the track of the detachment of Colonel Markosof, by the following route: Prom Krasnovodsk to Dzoi-uriuk, by a cross road to the Uzboi, or ancient bed of the Oxus (nearly 200 versts); from Dzoi-uriuk to Igdy, a | on ? fj 16 Uzboi, 114 versts ; from Igdy to the south-west, across the sands to Kizil-Arvat, the first fortress of the Turkomans (130 versts) ; from there the length of the Tekke oasis to the. fortress oi Beurma and back (13 versts); from Kizil-Arvat to the south-west, across the Kurendagh Mountains by the Adji Pass to Bair on e Sumbar, a stream falling into the Attrek on its right bank (82 versts);. from Bair, still to the south-west, along the Sumbar and then the Attrek to Chikishlar, the mouth of the river in the Caspian (more than 150 versts). t See the Journal of the Caucasus Section of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society, Yol. II., T®73 This report is accompanied by splendid map of the south-west portion of the Turkoman bteppe, on a sea e o versts to an inch.[ Ixii ] South of these deserts and beyond the valley of Arkateh rises the mountain chain of Kurendagh, the general direction of which is from north-west to south-east. At its com- mencemenUts breadth is about 60 versts, narrowing towards the south. At the point where the settlements of the Tekkes cease, the Kurendagh is joined by a continuation of the Elburz chain which crosses the north of Persia and Khorassan. In the angle formed by the junction of the Elburz and the Kurendagh rise the Attrek and the Gurgan, the only rivers which water the Turkoman Steppe. To the east the Kurendagh is prolonged to the spring of Kazantchik, beyond which rise the mountains of the Lesser Balkhan. Beyond it, as far as the shores of the Caspian, the country consists merely of sands and salt marshes. The general aspect of this region is that of a vast ocean of sand, out of which the above-named mountain ranges and the Usr-Urt rise like great islands. Leaving out of con sideration the Attrek, the Gurgan, and the streams from the Kurengagh which water the oasis of the Tekkes, the ancient bed of the Oxus forms the part of the region best supplied with water. Everywhere wells of fresh water are very scarce. There are certain districts of 100, 200, and 300 square versts in extent which possess only one well of fresh waters, and one is led to believe that any attempts to dig new ones would seldom be crowned with success. Want of water is the characteristic of the region, and this assertion is confirmed by the fact that the mountain system caused by the junction of the Kurendagh and the mountains of Khorassan, which is of considerable extent, only gives rise to two small rivers, the Attrek and the Gurgan, besides a few small rivulets watering the Tekke oasis. Under these physical conditions the land capable of cultivation can only form a very small proportion of the whole extent of the region. The presence of salt near the surface is an established fact in all the Turkoman country. It is to be found the whole length of the Uzboi, among the sands in the salt marshes, on the slopes of the Kurendagh, and finally, on the banks of the Attrek and the Gurgan. With regard to its meteorological conditions, the Turkoman Steppe presents extremes of temperature disproportioned to the latitude of the country. On one hand, at the close of summer in the month of September, the heat reaches 30* Reaumur in the shade; on the other, the cold is sometimes as much as 20- Reaumur below freezing. The seasons themselves present remarkable variations caused by the winds. The north-easterly gales blow ing from far and over an unprotected country as far as the region of the Turkomans cause a perceptible fall in the temperature; dry and often very violent, they have in addition the effect of raising clouds of dust on the arid surface of the Steppe, which, impregnated with salt particles, prove extremely injurious to the eyes. The south of the Steppe, protected from the wind by physical causes, is warmer than the centre. The westerly winds from the south and south-west blowing from the Caspian render the air damp, bring clouds and heavy and con tinuous rains in September and October. The whole of this region is, in fact, inhabited by the Turkomans, a people of the Turkish race, like the Tartars of the Caucasus and Northern Persia. As a rule, nomads, and speaking the Jagatai idiom, they may be subdivided into three distinct tribes—the Yomuds, the Goklans, and the Tekkes. In fact the only foreign element may be said to be the Persian Koords, who inhabit the upper valley of the Attrek, in the southern part of the Turkoman Steppe. The Turkomans are generally strong and robust, which one must attribute not merely to their mode of life, but also to the fact that, in the conditions of existence among them, death carries off at an early age all the weak and feeble subjects, and leaves only individuals in possession of a vigorous constitution. They are Sunnees, fairly religious, but not fanatics. They have several wives and readily intermarry with Persian or Koordish prisoners; in all cases Turkoman children of pure blood are more thought of, and are favoured in the question of inheritance. The Turkomans marry young, and prefer young widows as having had some experience in household manage ment. The status of the women is similar to that among other Mussulmans, but they do not live in such complete seclusion as with the Persians. All the work of the household falls upon them, in addition to the making of carpets and the curing of skins. The men have no occupation except in bidgandage and incursions [Allamarts) into neighbouring countries. As a rule the Turcomans lead a life which is quite patriarchal; they only acknowledge up to a certain point the authority of their elders (iakchiliar, aksakalj, and take the law into their own hands in case of robbeides committed on one another. [Journal de St. Petersburgh. No. 55 of 28th February (11£A March) 1876.] THE YOMUDS, THE GOKLANS, THE TEKKES, AND THE KOORDS. The Yomud Turkomans may be divided into two sections—the Bairamchali and the Karachukha. The former inhabit the northern part of the Khanate of Khiva, near Lake Aibughir, their camps being found as far as Sary Kamsyh. The Karachukha are divided into the tribes Tchoni and Cheret, so named after their two principal Chiefs, and are further subdivided into a number of clans; according to the mode of life, be it sedentary or nomad, they are termed respectively Charva and Chomura.[ Ixiii ] The Chomura Yomuds dwell in the lower vaIWq i ^ themselves to fishing in the streams and to cultivation of the la^d on kel b^kf ^They 0 so^f wheat, millet barley cotton, sesamum, &amp;e. On the banks of the Gurgan they feed gre jheril of horned beasts, but few camels Waggons (kibitki) serve for their habitation^ which as a rule are m a number together (called aouls) and, though they may not always remain in the same place, never move very far. J y bame Not so wtth the Charva Yomuds, who frequent the region between the Attrek and Gurgan for three cold months only of the year Deeember, January, and February, In March they depart with their flocks to the north of the Attrek, and fo/m their camps either on the right bank of that river, or near the fresh water lakes of Chairdy and Bougdaily in the sands of Kuul-Koum, near the shores of the Caspian, or along the Uzboi, or even in the vicinity of the Balkhan mountains m a tract of country extending to the north as far as the Gulf of Karabugaz, and to the east as far as the well of Igdy. The nomads remain a month and a halt or two months m one spot, and then depart to another. , E ^f ti 6 4 ttr6k been 1 ; eC0 I Ilized as fche frontier between Russia and Persia to the south of the Turkoman Steppe, the Russian Government, desirous to avoid brin&lt;W any violent change into the mode of existence among these nomads, while at the same time afixious to secure the regions under their dominion from irregular irruptions by unsubdued elements have issued an ordinance that, whenever the nomad tribes sojourn in Russian territory’ they must be in subjection to the Russian authorities, and be represented by Khans selected with the object of communication with those authorities during the whole period of their migrations. The Chomura and the Charva have numerous ties of affinity between them. It often happens that the father is sedentary and the sons nomads, at other times a sedentary Turko man becomes a nomad, and this change of life is induced by many reasons—by a marriage by loss of property, &amp;c. If, for instance, in summer it so happens that illness and fevers make their appearance in the valleys of the Attrek and the Gurgan, the number of emigrations to the north of the Attrek increase immediately. It is very difficult to form even an approximate idea of the total numbers of the Chomura and the Charva. Anyhow there is reason to believe that the total of 12,500 kibitkis for the two sections of the Yomud tribe, giving 77,500 souls, counting five individuals for each kibitki, as laid down by a person who has had the opportunity of obtain ing information respecting the Turkomans (published in an article of the “ Repertoire Militaire”) is admissible, though rather above than below the real number. The Yomuds occupy the valley of the Attrek and Gurgan up to the minaret of Gumbeti kaous, and to the river Geurme-rud, an affluent of the Gurgan. Further to the east dwell the Goklan Turkomans, about whose settlements we possess but the slightest information. We only know that these camps extend to the sources of the Gurgau and to the countries of the Koords of Boojnoord and of Semulgan (a small tributary of the higher Attrek on its left bank). They are also to be found about the sources of the Sumbar (a right affluent of the Attrek), and of the Chandir (a left affluent of the Sumbar), and the vicinity of the fortress of Karee Kala; these are feudatories of the Khan of Khiva, and have for their Chief Nur-Geldee Khan. The lands of the Goklans are better watered and contain more pasturage than those of the Yomuds. Like the other Turkomans, the Goklans live in kibitkis, but in clans of from 50 to 100 families. Their total number is estimated at the present time at 3,000 kibitki; formerly they were much more numerous, but a large portion of the tribe was forcibly deported to Khiva; another portion emigrated of its own free-will into that Khanate to avoid the Persian arms at the period of Mahomed Shalffs campaign on the borders of the Gurgan. Nearly all the Goklans are employed in agriculture and some few in rearing silkworms. As they are not nomad they possess very few camels; on the other hand, their herds of horned beasts are very considerable. The Tekke Turkomans inhabit a long and narrow oasis, extending from north-west, to south-east between the chain of the Kurendagh, and a range of sandy hills, the undulating outline of which is distinctly visible on the horizon at a distance of 20 or 30 versts from the mountains. There is reason to believe that the northerly winds which prevail in this region to have the effect of gradually driving these hills southward, so as to still moie contiact the Tekke oasis. The latter presents the appearance of a single valley with a clay soil, intersected by numerous threads of water from the Kurendagh. In this region it generally goes by the name of Arkatch, and affords the best of capabilities for agriculture and the growing ot useful fruits. A series of forts and fortalices have been established along this valley irom Kizil-Arvat, which may be considered as the extreme northerly point of the Tekke settlemen s (100 versts to the south-east of Igdy) to the south-west of Merv. These forts amoun o in number. They are all situated on the banks of the rivulets flowing from the Kurendagh, and are ’rounded by gardens and cultivated fields in the form of a square, eac environe y a sma npart and moat. The fields are cultivated by hand, by means of tools in the form of hoes^ ey sow wheat late in the autumn, and in spring, in addition to the w ea , a p an[ l x i v ] dioghena or djugara {holeus sorghum, or sorghum cernum ?) whicli they reap in September or October. The grain of this plant serves as food for man, and it is also given to the animals in place of corn; as for the stem, it provides hay for the horses and other domestic animals. According to the Tehkes themselves, it is by no means a communal system which is i n vogue with them in respect to the division of the cultivated land. Each plot of ground is the absolute property of individual, who can dispose of it at his own pleasure. There is no doubt that the valley of Arkatch constitutes one of the best portions of the Turkoman country, owing to the number of rivulets which traverse it. It is especially so to the south-east of Kizil-Arvat, where the mountains are higher, and the number of rivulets greater. On the neighbouring deserts the Tekkes are in the habit of pasturing their numerous herds. As a rule, this Turkoman tribe may be considered as half sedentary. They live in groups of dwellings more or less considerable, are up to a certain point under the authority of their elders or of influential personages, and thus constitute a state of society to some degree, though still feebly, organized. The result is that among the other Turkoman tribes, who live in a scattered manner and without any internal organization, the Tekkes enjoy the reputation of being the strongest; their excellent horses, of a justly renowned breed, render them formidable to their Persian neighbours, whom, to the present day, they attack in frequent allamans, or incursions, for the purpose of taking prisoners, whom they formerly used to sell at Khiva and Bokhara. In the course of these expeditions they used to reach as far as Meshed and Herat, which did not prevent them from finding themselves in turn attacked by their neighbours, the Persian Koords. In 1872, Colonel Markosof, and afterwards Colonel Stebnitzky, reconnoitred the whole length of the Tekke oasis. They visited some of its fortresses, notably Kizil-Arvat, Kotch, Mindleman-tcharys, Djenghi, Zaaou, Kizil-Chechme, Bamee, and Beurma, the last of which is 56 versts from the first. They were all in the form of squares, with mud ramparts. The largest was that of Beurma, the walls of which were three sagenes* (21 feet) in height. In the interior they had a second enclosure, representing the citadel, the walls of which were one sagene higher than the exterior ones. These two enclosures had loopholes for sharpshooters. Misdoubting the intentions of the Russians, the inhabitants had fled on their approach. The forts of Bamee and Beurma had been evacuated immediately before the arrival of Colonel Markosof, and iu such haste that the kibitki and other effects were left as they were. This circumstance gave the Russians an opportunity of seeing a Tekke aoul in its ordinary state. The kibitki were ranged on each side of the fortress; near some of them were mud huts used as granaries. In the kibitki were sacks of rice, grain, and djoghena, carpets, skins, and other household goods; in one were materials for smelting copper, in others, primitive instruments of husbandry or implements for weaving carpets. Horned cattle, fowls, and dogs roamed about the kibitki. In the vicinity of the fort were small gardens planted with poplars and cotton shrubs. Small watermills were established in the neighbourhood of nearly every fortress. Byond Beurma the line of the Tekke encampments is prolonged, as above-mentioned, to the south of Merve, and the fortresses are at a distance of 20 or 25 versts from each other. The inhabitants of the Tekke oasis as far as the fort of Anev, situated well beyond Beurma, call themselves Akhal Tekkes, probably to distinguish themselves from the other Tekkes living more to the south in the vicinity of Merve. The Tekkes are tributaries of the Khan of Khiva. During these latter days an under standing has been arrived at between them, in virtue of which, for the future, the tribute they have had to pay up till now in kind, and which consisted of a camel presented from each fortress yearly, has to be replaced by a money tax of 12 roubles annually on each water-course. With regard to the internal affairs of the Tekkes, thanks to the relations which have been established between them and General Lomakin in the course of the years 1874-75, and which were brought about by the claims made upon them for the surrender of the Yomud and Persian prisoners in their power, the following has been learnt:— About seven years ago, the Akhal Tekkes were governed by an independent Khan named Hur \ erdy Khan, who enjoyed absolute authority. At length, wearied by the insubordination of, and the incessant dissensions among, the people of his tribe, he abdicated his power and retired to Merve. from that time a most complete state of anarchy and confusion reigned in the Tekke oasis. Every one did just what pleased him, took the law into his own hands, and, sure of impunity, outrages on property, liberty, and life multiplied to such an extent that no one was safe from one day to another. Added to this were feuds and dissensions between the tribes.

The only remedy lay in electing a new Khan. They resolved on this, and at the end of January 875 at Gok-teppe, m the district of the Id,an K.mrdan-Mourad held a great national assembly, at which several thousands of people from all the forts and tribes of the Akhal Tekkes were present. After long and excited discussions the people unanimously decided to confer the title of Khan on Berdy Murad Khan, son of Nur Verdy, of the Tokhtamych clan Berdy Murad announced his conditions of acceptance-- You have become so corrupt and lead such an unworthy life said he to his compatriots, - that I shall never be able to o-overn you unless 1 am endued with the power of life and death over evil-doers, and first of all I demand the heads of four brigands who have latterly been guilty of acts of murder and robbery. On these conditions only will it be possible for me to re-establish order amoim you, and to reconcile you with the Russians, the Yomuds, the Khivans, and the Koords.” &amp; This harangue was equivalent to a refusal. The meeting then settled the matter as follows •— The fortresses nearest our frontier—Kizil-Arvat, Kara Senghir, Kotch, Zaaou, and Barnee, known by the general appellation of Bech-kala, and inhabited by the Tokhtamyeh clan—were' by the assembly placed under Safi Khan and Karadja-Khan; the fortress of Beurtna, inhabited by the Outemych, under Tikma-Sardar; the following, those of Artchman, Sonutcha, Mourtcha, Bahardan, Douroun-Karagan, Ag-Topa, Karvez, and Mekkin, the population of which was mostly Tokhtamych with a small admixture of Outemych, under the authority of Berdy Khan. Lastly, the forts between those of Jaradji and Anev (near Giaaurse and Deragez) were placed under the authority of a committee of four Khans, named Uraz mamed Khan, Avas-durdy- Khan, Kary-Ubeghi, and Mollah Kadam; the two former Tokhtamych, the two latter Oute- mych. The population of this portion of the oasis is of the Tokhtamych clan, with the excep tion of that of the forts of Izgant and of Gok-teppe, of which the former is all Outemych, the latter party so. At this general council it may be mentioned that the Tokhtamych, as the richer and stronger, were also the more interested in the maintenance of peace and order, and a good understanding with their neighbours. On the question of the surrender of the prisoners demanded by the Russians they declared themselves in a peaceable sense, and from the first took every care to fulfil promptly and punctually the terms of the demands put forward by General Lomakin through Sofi-Khan and Kourban-ichan. At their own cost a great number of Yomud prisoners were restored to the Russian authority. As regards the Outemych, perhaps from a feeling of anta gonism to the Tokhtamych, they have continued to maintain a hostile and suspicious demeanour, threatening to retire to Merve on the first appearance of a Russian emissary. The Persian Koords, whom we have frequently mentioned above, occupy the upper valley of the Attrek, between the right bank of this river, its affluent the Sumbar, and the south- ’easterly slopes of the Kurendagh. But little information is in our possession respecting them, but it appears that they hold numerous fortified posts, towns, and villages (of which there are said to be 80), with houses built of mud. The frontier line of these settlements, viz., the forts of Povile, Keltet-chinar, Germaou, Kilgilev, Kifal, Katlych, Sochk, and others, are at the most one menzil (or 25 versts) from the line of the Tekke forts. Between Askhabad in the Tekke country and the Attrek there are six narrow valleys or defiles, with magnificent vegetation and a very large population. The Koords are feudatories of Persia, and their—principal Khan is called Ermambet Khan. [Journal de St. Petersbourg, No. 58, daeed %nd (14&lt;iG) March 1876.]APPENDIX VIL [Referred to in paragraph 24, Chapter //.] CHIKISHLAE. THE ATTREK AND ITS AFFLUENT, THE SUMBAE. From the lake of Bougda'ily to the Russian post of Chikishlar, the distance is 110 versts. This distance was performed by General Lomakin’s detachment without encumbrance or difficulty, except as regards the camels, who in that season of the year (July and August), when renewing their coats, as also in March, when shedding them, are more sensitive and less capable of standing fatigue. The post of Chikishlar is situated on the seashore, near a well of a sagene and a half in depth, which supplies a brackish but drinkable water. The sea-coast is flat, and the water shallow, so that large vessels cannot approach nearer than 2 or 2| versts. Round the settlement vegetation is poor, and there is not enough pasturage even for camels. An aoiil of the Chomura, or sedentary Yomuds, consisting of nearly 200 families, is established near it. A little to the south, upon a promontory of the northern shore of the Gulf of Hassan Kuli, into which the Attrek flows, is the aoiil of Hassan Kuli, inhabited by more than 500 families of Yomuds, likewise sedentary, and pursuing the occupation of fishermen. From Chikishlar, across the Gulf of Astrabad, can be seen the chain of the Elburz, with the peak of Demavend, 18,000 feet above the level of the Caspian. After a prolonged halt at Chikishlar, during which the Russian detachment received a reinforcement from Baku, as well as a visit from the Commandant of the naval station of Ashurada, which is not more than 40 miles from Chikishlar, General Lomakin advanced towards Ba'iat-Hadji, on the Attrek, by the straight road, crossing the steppe diagonally, and passing by the lake and well of Karadja Batyr. This march was 75 versts, and took three days, being performed as easily as the preceding ones, without hurrying, and resting between the hours of 10 and 3 of the day, when the heat was too great. The horses, although deprived of hay and grass and only fed on barely, were nevertheless the whole time in good condition. The detachment arrived at Baiat-Hadji on the 4th September, and fixed their camp on the site of a temporary fort which the Russians had erected some years before. Bai'at Hadji derives its name from the tomb of a saint much venerated by the Turkomans, situated i| versts higher up the river. The tomb consists of an arch of bricks resting on pilasters of a pyramidal form. In 1872, Colonel Stebnitzky saw near the tomb offerings that had been placed there by the Turkomans; these were fragments of earthenware and iron caldrons, the one containing water, and the other pieces of bread. The Turkomans approached in turn, wet their foreheads in one caldron, and placed pieces of bread in the other. At this place the Attrek is only two or three sagenes in width, and can be forded. Eighteen versts lower there is another ford, known by the name of Jag-'iai'la-oloum, where the breadth of the Attrek is six or seven sagenes, with a depth of five feet. From the latter ford up the river, the banks of the Attrek rise gradually, and form terraces one above the other. At the time of the arrival of General Lomakin’s detachment, the right bank of the Attrek from Baia-tHadji to Bairam-oloum, an extent of 30 versts, was occupied by innumer able encampments of Charva Yomuds of various tribes, in nearly 4,000 kibitki. These nomads are generally termed Eastern Charva, to distinguish them from those who fix their camps near Lakes Chairdy and Bougdaily, and who are called Western Charva. They are the wildest and rudest of the Charva tribes under our dominion, and are a source of terror to the Persians of Astrabad. Up to 1873 they preserved sentiments of implacable hostility towards us. Now affairs have completely altered ; men, women, and children appeared unconcerned at the approach of the Russians, and when the camp was fixed thronged it throughout, bringing merchandize of various kinds, horses, skins, &amp;c., tor sale; in a word, they received the Russian detachment without distrust, and in like manner to the mode in which General Lomakin was received near Lakes Chairdy and Bougdaily. this region has a very healthy climate, fever being unknown; grass lands are everywhere, and afford excellent pasturage to the flocks. In the neighbourhood there is game in abun dance-wild boars and antelopes; the river supplies geese arM ducks, and any quantity of ti^h—siluri, perch, and carp. The immense gardens worked by the nomads prove that the district is susceptible of extended cultivation, and would grow excellent vegetables. Besides, Lai'at Hadji presents the advantage of water communication with the sea at a distance of scarcely 70 versts from the Gulf of Hassan Kuli, which affords shelter for vessels and good anchorage all the year round. Baiat-Hadji seems well designed for the establishment of a fixed post, and in any case it would become a great market, where Russian produce could e bartered with advantage for the raw produce of the Turkomans, who, except here, can find no other opportunity of trading. from Bar at Hadji General Lomakine undertook an exploration, with part of his detach ment, along the upper course of the Attrek, and its tributary the Sumbar.Between Baiat-Hadji and the district caliph ^ . by the junction of the Attrek and its tributary the Sumkir^Tm] 0 ?

The plain down* to’ the nght bank is called Mongaulan, and is interspersed with hills of various heights The veo-etn tion is poor, and consists only of shrubs. Across the river is seen a series°of highlands,' th! Goktcha-dagh, the Kour-dagh, and others, which are covered with snow towards the clo!e of the year. During the march from Baiat-Hadji to Tchat, General Lomakin fell in with numbers of Charva Yomuds, who having exhausted the pasturages they had occupied, were goin«- down the Attrek in search of fresh grass land. The scene was grand and magnificent and quite novel to European eyes. The entire country, as far as the eye could-see, that is within a radius of some tens of versts, was covered with long files of waggons, accompanied on the right and left by great flocks of sheep and camels. Every phase of nomad life was presented in its actuality; the waggons were loaded with all the property, the household o- 0 ods and implements made use of by the nomads. According to custom the whole tribe were clothed in their best garments. The men were armed from head to foot with their best weapons on their best horses, which they had adorned with their smartest trappings, and marched at the head of their .aouls. -The women and children travelled on camels in paniers of peculiar make. The whole march had a touch of solemnity and an appearance of festival peculiar to a nomad on his transmigrations. Soon after this meeting the detachment fell in with a great caravan of camels—nearly 100—loaded with bread, vegetables (onions and garlic) coming from the Tekke oasis on its way to the camps of the Charva Yomuds. The guides of the caravan reported that their country was again a prey to disorders. The old Khan of the Akhal Tekkes, Nur Verdy Khan, had had a quarrel with the four new Khans between whom the national assembly in the month of January 1875 had divided the territory over the Akhal Tekkes. Acts of violence, followed by the murder of a Turkoman, had further complicated matters between the parties and led to bloody reprisals. There is some reason to believe that these dissensions arose from the secret desire of Nur Verdy Khan to re-establish his sole and absolute authority over the Akhal Tekkes, which he had been forced to resign. A short way from Tchat, General Lomakin had an agreeable surprise in meeting a courier bringing letters from Khiva. This fact bears witness to the security now reigning in the country, and the good understanding between the Russians and the Tekkes brought about by the conferences at Igdy. At the very moment that the messengers approached the Russian detachment a cloud of dust rose in his direction; at first it was thought to indicate the presence of a hostile body of horse, but the matter was soon explained to be an immense troop of wild horses (koulan) counting perhaps several thousands who were disporting themselves on the plain. The Russian detachment pursued its exploration along the right bank of the Sumbar, which however it dhi not ascend more than six versts. This affluent of the Attrek rises in the Kurendagh. At 60 or 70 versts from its source, and at 25 from a small Turkoman fort named Kareekala, which was completely abandoned in 1872, is a district named Bair, at an elevation of 45 feet above the level of the Caspian. Here the glen of the Sumbar is more thau 150 sagenes in breadth, with steep banks in height from 10 to .15 sagenes. The bed is bordered by tamarisks and harbaeeous plants; the water is almost fresh, and the current runs three feet per second. The river itself is only one or two sagenes in breadth and has a depth of four or five feet. Thirteen versts below Bair the Sumbar receives from the left a small tributary, the Chandyr, four feet in depth, running through a deep ravine with clayey hanks. At the point of its junction with the Chandyr, the Sumbar is 2| sagenes in width, from Bair one road ^oes north to the first fortress of the Tekke oasis, named Kizil-Aivat.[ Ixviii ] This road crosses the whole width of the Kurendagh by the Adji pass, the culminating point of which is the Col of Oullia-Kochliong, nearly 1,997 feet above the level of the Caspian. The distance from Bair to Kizil-Arvat by this road is 82 versts. Daring the stay of the Russian detachment in Tchat, the earlier mentioned investigations of the ancient aqueduct which leaves the valley of the Attrek, and used formerly to supply the south-east portion of the Turkoman Steppe and the city of Mestorian, were undertaken by General Lomakin's orders. Likewise during this time the detailed map of the upper course of the Attrek from Tchat to Pichkala was laid down by the surveyor Pepeliaiew, who was greatly aided in his task by the lofty situation chosen for the Russian encampment, from which he was able to view all the surrounding region. He added to his works details of information gathered from Native Koords and Turkomans, who were thoroughly acquainted with the country. After completing these labours, the detachment of General Lomakin set out on its return journey, passed Bai'at-Hadji and Chikishlar, arriving at Krasnovodsk by the route it had followed on setting forth, after an absence of more than four months.

The name Simbar is also applied to the upper branch after the -junction of the two northern tributaries. The meaning: of the word has been lost. It is probably very old and applied either to the river or the district.

A small stream draining Boojnoord joins it at the village Garmekhan. The Garmekhan tract continues for twelve miles. Thence the river passes into a defile known as the “ Zoo,” a term signifying a precipitous „ Zoo » defile&gt; gorge, through which it flows for seven miles, pent up between continuous walls of perpendicular rock, always impracticable, and rising often to several hundred feet in height. From Garmekhan to the Zoo the river is fordable at a few points only, and flows between banks from fifteen to twenty feet in height, over a muddy bed. From the Zoo it debouches on to the plain of Mana, a strip of alluvial level varying in Mana width from four to eight or nine miles, through which it follows a tortuous course, between banks always perpendi cular and increasing in height, for 50 miles where it passes into a second defile. For the first twelve miles from the Zoo as far as Peshkala there are villages on both banks, and the valley is fairly cultivated; beyond is a swampy treeless flat, overgrown with reeds, eight to ten feet in height, with a few patches of rice cultivation and some crumbling mud walls marking the sites of villages deserted since the troubled times following the death of Nadir Shah. The hills on either side of the valley reach the level with an easy slope and afford good pasturage. The drainage of Kooshkhana is delivered opposite Peshkala through a valley known as the Shirin Durra. Further west the Gogool Chai and the Chihl Guzr or Ab-i-Khartoot are received from the north, and the Incha and Garmab streams from the south. Leaving the Mana plain the river is pent up between two high mountains and flows through a defile, which appears to be, and is described as, Defile above Morava. absolutely impassable, except for active footmen. The reed jungle increases in density, and thickets of alder overhang its precipitous banks. Clearing this last defile a wide plain known to the Koords as Morava is gained. The mountains recede on either hand, and the river becomes more Morava - shallow and is often fordable; its banks continue fringed with reed beds and low woods till the open plain is reached. From Morava upwards to the Zoo” defile the Atrak is a perfect natural ditch.

It drains the eastern slopes of the mountains, Salig, Aladagh, and Takht-Mirza, and the plain of Boojnoord. draining the Simulghan plain falls in. Thence to the Incha is an unbroken line of precipitous limestone heights known as the Koh-i-Doehing. The Incha is a deep and narrow reed-grown ditch, a counterpart in miniature of the Atrak. Though draining the northern slopes of the great peak Korkhood, and a wide extent of rough hill, and grassy undulating plain, it discharges a few feet of water only. West of the Incha is the Garmab stream of similar character though smaller. It drains the barren§ plain of Soncha-Shahabat. Below this point inconsiderable rills only join the main stream. The mountains of the southern section of the drainage basin rise to a far greater height than those of the north, are more abrupt and rugged in outline, and enclose larger areas of level plain. They are formed for the most part of grey limestone. Spurs of slate are common and volcanic rocks occur infrequently. Low hills of saline clays and variegated marls extend along the base of the chain. f This estimate includes only the streams west of Sherwan, and is a rough computation of their aggregate discharge when not in flood. X Square feet. At Peshkala a small stream § Barren only as compared with the country north of the Atrak. It is by no means destitute of wood and pasture. A thin growth of dwarf juniper covers the northern slopes at the higher altitudes, and is replaced to the west of Koh Korkhood by forest of deciduous trees. After the melting of the snows excellent pasturage is found from the lowest slopes up to the highest elevations, and in late autumn and during the whole winter and spring the plains are covered with a rough herbage of camelthorn and wild rue, with patches of sweet grass sufficient for sheep, goats and camels. Between the base of the main chain and the river, but separated from the latter by a j| Julgah, a term in common use de- succession of low rugged ridges, lie thin wide plains or level scribing a plain surrounded by moun- valleys, the “ Julgah'|| of Boojnoord, Simulghan and Soncha tains ' Shahabat. The first is already well known. It has an area of about 100 square miles, is abundantly watered and fertile, and supports a populatiou of 15,000. The Simulghan plain has an area of miles, with a fertile soil, and a sufficient supply of water from natural sources for the present limited population. Any considerable increase of population would necessitate recourse to artificial means of supply, and must he necessarily slow, and, as in all parts of Central Persia, somewhat precarious. Under the recently altered conditions of the country, a small and continuous increase may be anticipated. The plain of Soncha-Shahabat, which is named from two large villages now ruined, is broken by the courses of the two streams Incha and Garmab, and by low undulations dividing it from the plain of Simulghan. It is insufficiently watered and consequently for the most part arid and desert. The ruins of some half dozen large villages mark the course of the streams, and a large portion of its surface is no doubt susceptible of artificial irrigation.

There are but few prominent mountain peaks, and the formation and heio-hts of the various ranges traversing it are more uniform. There are no wide stretches of level -country, and yet a far larger culturable area, for the land alike in the valleys, on the mountain slopes, and on the ugliest summits, shows trace of ancient cultivation and bears a eompara- lively rich natural vegetation. ^ A glance at the accompanying map will show that there are three principal ranges or Mountain system. ridges, all emanating directly from the Koh-i-Giffan, a very P rec ^P^ ous P ea k lying to the west of Kooshkhana and running westwards m broad expanding hands of mountain table-land terminating in the Atrak plain. Draining these ridges are the valleys of the Atrak, the Chandyr and the Soont. The summits of the ridges are plain for the most part and undulate easily and their slopes are seldom steep. From the highest point of the central ridge a wide stretch of rolling-downs, level plateaux and long easy slopes extend on every side, and the eye meets with no^ marked features till it lights on the snow-elad summits of Korkhood, Aladagh, and Giffan, and the lesser peaks of the Atrak range to the north. The lateral spurs given out by the main ridges to the south are in parts precipitous, and those visible from the low level of the Atrak banks rise in peaks which appear considerable. To the north the slopes are almost uniformly easy. The lower features whereof easy outline are formed of shales, or of light and seemingly rich loamy clay, with hut seldom the indications of salt common in the country south of the river. Where rocks crop out they are, in the more rugged parts, of limestone, elsewhere of sandstone, and slate. A rich pasturage covers all but the steepest slopes of the mountains, and the grass in the Vegetation valleys is green and fresh even in mid-winter. The glens and lower slopes are fairly clothed with juniper growing to a height of ten to twenty feet, of no value as timber from its gnarled and twisted growth, but furnishing an unlimited supply of fuel, and the deeper hollows are rendered nearly impene trable by dense thickets of juniper of better growth than those found on the mountains, dwarf maple, willow and alder matted with wild vine and briar. The vines for the most part mark the sites of former gardens, and their fruit is said to have lost little by some centuries of untended growth. Pheasants and wild hog swarm in the dense reed beds of the valleys, and large flocks of moufflon range the grassy downs in almost undisturbed tranquillity.

In many cases the depopulation dates only from 100 to 150 years ago, and the descendants of the dispossessed will point out the hearthsite and eornland of their forefathers. In the valley of the Shirin Chai, the Khartoot stream, and the Chandyr and their latteral glens, some 30 to 40 ruined villages, may, it is estimated, still l)e seen, and the v alley of the Soont from the ruins of Darna and Mashad-i-GhilJaman to a point some miles below Karikalla was once a continuous line of villages and cultivation. The Atrak range also was well peopled, and one large village, Nokhor, situated in a posi tion so strong as to defy assault, still remains a solitary evidence of ancient possession. Though holding directly from Persian ancestors, the population of Nokhor have become much mixed in blood, and have lost their old political status. While still holding adverse possession of their cliff-girt glen they axe constrained to some dependence on their neighbours. Many find it politic to conciliate c r nine o Boojnoord by a yearly tribute, and the Turkomans by early information of the movements ot the Koords. Prom the Atrak northwards to the Turkoman settlements, a distance of 80 miles, and fcwards from the Shirin Chai to the Yamoot plain, not less than 100 miles the whole extent iountry is, with the exception of the two villages, Karikalla an - o T or, o -P ited, and for the most part remains in unbroken solitude. Bands o _ 00 ^ ^ c i raiders trace out at long intervals the bridle paths leading from ie nvei p Atrak chain, and their scouts keep constant watch on the crests o t on ei ,marks of their horses' hoofs and smouldering camp fires are the only signs they leave of their passage. Settlements have been attempted within recent * ^ az - times by the Koords on the plains of Kaz* and Gargilanf f Jargi an. ^ conditions of life enforced by state of constant war-' fare were found to be too rigorous. In like manner the Yamoots are kept out of the pastures of the Morava and Chandyr which they frequent when the weakness of their Koord foes permits, and the Akhal Turkomans have been foiled in many attempts to settle in the valley of the Soont. West of the Koochan country the first tributary from the north is the Shirin Chai, better known as the Shirin Durra or glen. Rising in the south slopes of the outer chain this stream drains the Kooshkhana valley and flows thence through a long and tortuous defile to the Atrak at Man a, where it contributes a volume of about 36 feett section. The next stream westwards is the Gogool Chai, a mere brook draining the marshy reed-grown plain lying behind the Northern tributaries. Shirin Chai. X Square feet. Gogool Chai. first ridge north of the river. Twenty-five miles below the Gogool Chai, the stream known as the Ab-i-Khar toot, or the Chihl Guzr (40 fords), joins the Atrak. Rising in the Ab-i-Khartoo . glen of Kaz it flows through a valley, once well cultivated, past the ruins of Khartoot, a large village of the Geraili § Square eet. Toorks, into the defile of the “ forty fords' and thence to the Atrak contributing a stream of about sixteen feet§ section. From the Chihl Guzr mouth to the junction of the Simbar which brings the waters of the two northern streams there are no tributaries. The junction of the Simbar is known as the Chat or the im ar ‘ Chat-i-Atrak, a word signifying “ junction,' the origin of which is lost. Following up the Simbar for about miles, the junction of the two streams which form it—the Chandyr and the Ab-i-Soont—known as the Chat-i-Chandyr is reached. The Chandyr is a small stream contributing a volume of water not more, ordinarily, than from 36 to 38 feet square in section. It has its source in some marshy springs known as the Soaksoo, and flows through the plain of Jargilan and through successive stretches of narrow defile and reed- grown flats to its junction with the Ab-i-Soont, a course of about miles. The Ab-i-Soont is the largest tributary &lt; of the Atrak. It carries at all times a larger volume of water and is liable to heavy floods. Its course from the marshy flats of Tagharao, where it rises may be estimated at miles. Soont. ^ The valley is wide and level, amply watered and fertile. Below Karikalla it opens out into the great Atrak plains. The surface is still undulating and broken, and the stream, which above is deep and marshy, is said here to flow rapidly over a shallow bed, falling at one point over high rocks, with a noise that may be heard for many miles. The volume of water contributed by the Soont may be at a rough estimate about from i to |rds that of the Atrak at the point of junction. As above mentioned the only points inhabited in the whole northern tract are Karikalla Karikalla and Nokhor and Nokhor. The latter is, as mentioned, also, the only rem nant of Persian occupation in those parts. The village, con sisting of 200 houses, which will give a population of about 1,000 souls, lies in a narrow precipitous glen on the northern face of the mountain Oochkuya. The position is so defensible that the people have been able to defy all the attacks of the Turkomans, and not many years ago beat off with loss an expedition sent to reduce them by the Governor of Asterabad, whose Koords were aided by two regular regiments and some guns. It is however of no strategic importance, and its brave defenders will without doubt be constrained to accept whatever fate may be in store for their Turkoman neighbours. The fort or settlement of Karikalla, regarding the true position of which there has hitherto been some doubt, lies on the right bank of the Soont stream at a distance of miles from Kyzil Arvat, if the position given for that place on the latest Russian maps be true, and separated from it by a chain of hills across which there is no line of road practicable for wheels, and by a wide stretch of broken country, waste and deficient in water. By a detour west the hills may be turned, but the distance to be traversed is increased to three days' journey, which may be estimated at miles. From Boojnoord the settlement lies miles and from Astrabad miles. A very difficult tract of mountainous country lies between it and the former place, lo the latter it lies open, the most direct and best route being however closed by the lamoots. A low rampart and a ditch enclose the reed-thatched huts of the Goklan settlers, and a level plain extends for some distance round. As a defensible position, it has no peculiar ad vantages.20 [ Ixxiii ] The failure of the large Persian force sent against it can only have been due to the causes that have always decided in favor of the Turkomans the issue of all attempts by the Persians at regular warfare. The Persian regulars were ill-armed, inferior in courage to the Tekkeh garrison ill-fed and unsheltered at an inclement season. &amp; t0 tne As a position liable to he occupied by Russia it has also no special importance. Since he base of operations of the trans-Casp,an command has been finally (as appear) shifted from the mouth of the Atrak to Krasnovodsk, it no longer lies on their line of march towards the Tekkeh country, and it opens also no better line of advance into Persia than would be gained by the occupation of any other point in the Soont valley. With the Atrak already in the hands or Russia, its occupation would have political weight, mainly as an evidence of the intention of the Russian aggressors to disregard the mountain boundary as a possible limit to their advance. r Below will be found some notes on tbe principal routes traversing the portion of the Advantages that will accrue to Atrak basin under consideration; but before leavincr the Russia from occupation of the trans- northern section it will be well to note concisely the direct Atra ^ T't u advantages that will accrue to Russia, if the cession of this tract which was reported to have been made to her in 1868 be carried out. At the tmie of. the alleged cession (there is no evidence yet published of its conclusion) the Persian Government was unaware of the value of the country they were about to cede and moreover unaware that they were about to hand over from 20,000 to 30,000 of their subiects to a foreign power. J When informed by tbe Koord Chiefs whose clans were thus threatened with forcible and arbitrary partition, they modified the original scheme to some extent, and it may be assumed that the villages of the Garmekhan of Boojnoord and the whole of the State of Koochan north of the Atrak will he retained by Persia; the Turkoman Atrak and the whole tract north of the Atrak and west of the Shirin Durra being left to Russia to be occupied at leisure. Exclusive of the Turkoman “ Atrak ” which is not now under consideration, the area of the tract further limited to the foot of the western slopes of the mountains is roughly 3,500 square miles; of this total, 200 square miles at a very rough computation is capable of culti- * That is lying at an irregable level vation with advantages of water,* and consequently of being ami with a soil not desert, and in con- at once settled and put under crops to any extent desired, sequence presumably cultnrable. without heavy cost for works of irrigation, such as is a preli minary necessity on the Atrak plain, and also without need of provision against a failure of crops. Nearly the whole of the remaining area is excellent pasture land, and a large proportion of it is also culturable, and has been widely cultivated in former times. The pasture is not the half-withered thorny herbage which suffices for the lean flocks of the Central Persian highlands, but on wide areas a close growing, deep and luxuriant grass, equal in value, without doubt, to the best mountain pasturage of more favored countries. The climate of the tract is superior to that of any part of Eastern Persian. The winter is milder than that of the highlands south of the river, and the summer less hot than that of the neighbouring lowlands of the Atrak and Gurgan, while the air is neither desicated nor overcharged with moisture as in other parts. Water is everywhere abundant, iu springs on the mountains and in brooks in the lateral glens of the two main valleys, and there is wood fit for fuel in unlimited quantity. The strategic value of so secure a lodgment south of the great barrier offered by the Khivan desert can hardly be overstated. The trans-Caspian force will find a healthy and convenient location which no part of the Eastern Caspian shore affords. Its communication with the Caspian, though faulty from the nature of the coast, and of the intervening country, is improvable. A line of 160 to 170 miles of railroad would place it in connection with the head of the Krasnovodsk inlet and a somewhat longer line of 200 miles with the harbour of Ashurada. The principal difficulty to be overcome on the first line is the waterless nature of the country to be traversed. Timber, though probably not procurable of sufficient size on the Balkhans, can be procured in any quantity required, either from Mazanderan or the Russian western coast. I uel will be found in the Balkhans if it should be preferable to the mineral oil of Baku. The second line would run through a country well-watered aud fertile for 140 miles, or three-fourths of its length, but it is cut off from the present Russian line on the Atrak by. 40 niiles of intervening Persian territory. The difficulties of securing a convenient, communica tion between the anchorage of Ashurada and the Russian side of the Hassan Kouli Bay would, however, be no doubt far greater than the political difficulty of obtaining a fresh cession from Persia. This difficulty looms large in view of Persian jealousy regarding any Russian contact with the Mazanderan coast, but times have ranch changed since the occupation oi As ma a, mid a secure footing on the Upper Atrak may be calculated to make many things easy etween Russia and Persia that may now appear liable to cause serious difference. A railway is no doubt a work of time, and on the northern line would he also a costly and difficult undertaking, but its construction would be so necessary to secuie e posi ion o a force posted on the Upper Atrak, that it may he assumed that the cost was counted and the difficulties estimated before negotiations were opened with Persia for a cession o em oiy.For present purposes, that is, for the advance on the “ Atrak” line, and the subjugation of the Akhal Turkoman, the Krasnovodsk route has been proved co be sufficiently convenient. The harbour of Krasnovodsk is at least a secure base, and the Yamoots will render all needful assistance if not moved by external hostile instigation. It is not possible to calculate exactly the time that would be required to improve sufficiently the communications with the sea, and to subdue the holders of the Atrak, for the question depends on the efforts made and the amount of resources employed. An autumn cam- paign would suffice to drive the whole Akhal tribe into the desert, if not to secure their sub mission, and a force stationed in the Atrak might in another year draw its supplies from the sea by rail; such efforts need, however, hardly be anticipated, save in the face of grave emergency. Securely possessed of the Upper Atrak, the trans-Caspian force, which will probably become localised under some other appellation, will command the Gurgan Pass, and, in conse quence, the only really practicable line of route through the mountains eastwards, thereby serving Khorassan from Persia in a military point of view, and politically to an extent depend ing on the nature of the occupation, and laying open the various roads through the productive Khoord States to Mashad and Herat. Regarding the political efforts of such a situation, there may be differences of opinion elsewhere; on the spot there are none. The allegiance of the Khoord Chiefs to Persia, at no time very close, will be diverted, and the whole mass of the population will be brought to accept Russian domination as their inevitable future. The idea of Russia, as a peaceable and benevolent neighbour, with unexpensive boundaries, is entirely beyond conception, and would be rejected by any Central Asiatic as contrary to reason and experience. Over the countries further east the presence of the Russian force would have much the same disturbing effect that the occupation by an English force of Khulm or Koondooz, or any other point on the Upper Oxus, would have on the Khanates. Questions of policy and prestige may however be deemed to be introduced here out of place, and it is sufficient to point distinctly to the fact that the material advantages accruing to the Russians with possession of the Atrak basin, great as they will be, will hear no com parison in value with the enormous access of influence that she will acquire over the minds of Afghans and Persians. Routes. The routes leading to the interior of Khorassan and thence to the countries to the east from the Caspian may be conveniently divided into two classes : the first comprising those leading from west to east, which are more or less practicable for military movements on a large scale; the second, those leading from north to south, across the Atrak basin, which are not so, and could not without much labor be made practicable for the movements of any but small and very lightly equipped forces. The principal routes leading from the Caspian eastwards are three in number. The first from Krasnovodsk to Kyzil Arvat, and along the “ Atrak” to Ak Derbund. Routes from the Caspian eastward. The second from Chekishlar or Krasnovodsk to the Chat-i-Atrak, and thence following the river to Koochan. The third from Chekishlar or from Asterabad to the Gurgan defde, the Shanghai! plain, Isperayin and Nishapur. The Kyzil Arvat route is now well known, at least as far as that place, which has been ’ J - now three times occupied by Russian troops. From Krasnovodsk to Kyzil Arvat, a distance of 253 miles* the country is desert, but sufficiently supplied with water for movements of small detachments. The appendix! gives a route usually followed by the Turkomans and presumably the one followed by the columns of Markasoff and Lomakin. From Kyzil Arvat to Gawars the route traverses a level country dotted with Turkoman Obahs, each of which marks a stream or spring. The only long distance to be traversed without water is from Kyzil Arvat to Kooch, 6 farsakhs or 24 miles. The whole distance from Kyzil Arvat to Gawars is 170 miles. From Gawars the route follows the hill skirts, and passes through the Atrak villages of Dereguez and Khelat to the banks of the Heri-Rood, a distance of 160 miles, well supplied with grass and water throughout. From the Heri-Rood at this point to Herat is U0 miles, to Mashad 120 miles. I rom Gawars to the Dereguez “ Atrak ” is a route to Merve frequently used by caravans. The second route is the most direct line from the Caspian to Mashad and Herat and it has hitherto been considered the proper line of advance foi a force moving on those points.

The Turkoman route to Shahkadam gives only 44 farsakbs or 176 miles and to Shahkadam, the highest navig able point of the inlet, troops may he carried by water, f Will follow. Atrak route. It is mentioned by Colonel Venukoff, whose information ~ w uj v^wiuulci v euuKuu, wjLiuw iiuuruiawuu regarding Turkoman frontier is still presumably relied on by the Russian staff, for they recent opportunities of obtaining better information, and also by Colonel V. Baker, describes the route as practicable, having been misled by the appearance of the Atrak routes have on had valkwhich is open down to the point he reached, or by his informants, whose measures of the practicability of a road would differ much from his own. As a fact the route is a difficult one for mounted men, and barely practicable for laden mules. The following' description of the route, which the accompanying map will illustrate, will show that even to make a road fit for wheels would be a serious undertaking. From the Atrak plain to the Morava Tapa, a distance of 115 miles from Chekishlar, and 220 miles from Krasnovodsk, the country is level and open above this point; the hill skirts touch the river and confine it between high undulating banks. At about 16 miles from the mound of Morava, high mountains close in and form a long and tortuous defile, lined with inaccessible cliffs, along the base of which there is but a rugged foot-path. The defile has no local name, but is known as the “ Tanga” or straits. Leav ing the river above the mound, the existing road or track winds over low hills to the base of the left flank of the defile, which it ascends to a point known as the “ Takhta” or plateau of Chalabi. Crossing the plateau the track again descends to the Garmab stream. The ascent and descent may be estimated at 5,500 feet of which 3,000 feet may be ascent. From Morava to this point the distance is 24 miles. Above the junction of the Garmab stream the river is still shut in by low rugged hills which oppose a barrier to passage along its banks, and the tract follows up the Incha stream for some miles, and thence crossing a series of low ridges descends again to the Mana valley, and the river, which must, to avoid the projecting spurs of Koh Doehing, be crossed by a bad ford. At 40 miles from Garmab the Mana villages are reached, and the track ends practically in a cul-de-sac. Further passage up the river is barred by the “ Zoo” defile, through which there is but a narrow mule path, and the road over the mountains to Boojnoord has a total ascent and descent of about 5,000 feet and is steep and difficult. The easiest exit is to the south across the Simulghan plain and the Dihana-i-Darkash pass. Thence Mashad may be reached by Venukoff’s route lying through Boojnoord and Koochan, but the Boojnoord mountain country is difficult, and there is an easier route to the south over the Isferayin plain. The third route will be seen marked with a broad red line on the annexed map. It leads up the Gurgan and is the easiest natural line of route across Gurgan route. the chain to be found in its whole length from the Kyzil Ozan valley, west of Teheran, to Moozderan, east of Mashad. Above and below the Gurgan defile, the country is open and level, and the defile itself is comparatively an easy pass and is still used by caravans in spite of constant danger from Turkomans. The distance to Mashad from Asterabad or Chekishlar by this route is about 470 miles, and from Krasnovodsk via Kyzil Arvat, 680 miles. From Mashad to Herat is 206 miles further Though lying to the south of the Atrak, the Gurgan pass is virtually m the hands ot any force posted on the river or in the country north of it, for there is no Persian garrison nearer than Asterabad. North of the Gurgan defile is another route leading up a feeder of the Gurgan and over a low pass on to the plain of Soncha-Shahabat, which was followed by Burnes, and has evidently been confounded with the southern route by Venukoff. It is the more direct line from Boojnoord to the Gurgan plain, but the pass is described as difficult, and there are no traces of former use. The comparative value for military purposes of the two practicable routes described may • be summarised as follows, it being premised that the only Comparative value of the Atrak and military purpose to which they can be put is the invasion o Gurgan routes. the Turkoman country or of Afghanistan.

Physical Obstacles.

It has one mountain pass of about 20 miles, with an ascent of 2,000 to 2,500 feet over which a good mule track exists. A road for guns might he found turniug the pass, but for the baggage train of a large force there would be no alternative. One river, the Atrak, under 150 feet in width, would necessarily be bridged, and pro bably a second, the Gurgan, of about the same width. The Chekishlar-Atrak line has about 100 miles of broken country lying between the Chat-i-Atrak and Kyzil Arvat in excess of the first line, but it entirely avoids the Balkhan desert. The Chekishlar-Gurgan line avoids the desert, but has in exchange 30 or 40 miles of swampy forest country over which a road would be needed. Starting from Kinara the diffi culties of this section would be somewhat increased. Supplies. In the matter of supplies the Krasnovodsk-Atrak and the Chekishlar-Atrak routes are practically equally unsuitable for movements on a large scale. Little or no grain could be pro cured on either line. They must be supplied from the sea or from the Persian provinces on the Caspian, which is the same thing as regards distance, and from the northern districts of Khorassan over difficult mountain paths. The Gurgan route runs everywhere nearer the producing districts of Persia. A force of 30,000 to 40,000 men would with the co-operation of the Persians have no difficulty in obtain ing supplies of all kinds on its road. This has been so often demonstrated practically that there is no need to look for evidence. Cauriage. . The desert lines of route lie through the Turkoman settlements whence very large num bers of camels may be procured. The Yamoot herds are already available, and can supply 4,000 to 5,000 on demand. The herds of the Akhal and Merve Tekkeh will not he procurable save in small numbers and by coercion for two or three years. The Yamoot camels would be equally available on the southern route, and might be supplemented from Persia. Taking 15,000 as the number of camels that would be required to move the bag^ao'e of a lightly equipped force of 40,000 men, no great difficulty would be encountered in procuring them. In respect of security also the southern route is far superior to the northern. If it could be used at all it would be secured : there would be no necessity for strong convoys and entrenched depots. . N It may be assumed therefore that for either of the objects above indicated, the co operation of the Persian Government would be at present necessary, and that with its co operation a sufficient force might be transported to Herat in from eight to twelve weeks from its arrival on the Caspian Coast. After the lapse of two, or at most three years, if sufficient efforts were made, Persian aid would be no longer necessary; all that Bussia would need would be her neutrality. I or an attack on Merv in co-operation with a force moving from the Oxus, Russian resources would probably be now sufficient. A small force lightly equipped might with the Aamoots as auxiliaries force its way to i leiv and would be able to maintain itself there, and to re-open its communications with the sea after its success was assured.

The total distance to Doran, where it debouches on the “Atrak” may be estimated at 100 miles. The fact that it passes the Atrak ridge at so hi«h a point is sufficient to negative any other advantages it may possess. Route No. 4 is the most direct practicable line between Boojnoord and the Atrak. It crosses Boojnoord to Atrak by Dagarmoyah all the main drainage lines of the country, but crosses them Pass- . a high level. As shown in the annexed map, it follows the Boojnoord stream to its junction with the Atrak and thence follows that river to Soorook. There is however a short cut across the Boojnoord hills to Soorook practicable for mules. From Soorook a rough broken country is crossed to the Chirin Chai and thence to the Dagarmoyah Pass, which is high, but is said to be practicable for mules. Route No. 5 leads from Boojnoord to Savaldi in the Kooshkliana district, and thence Boojnoord by Kooshkhana to the over a high pass by easy gradients to the Garmab glen, out Atrak - of which there is an easy road to the Atrak. The descent to Garmab is somewhat steep and difficult, but practicable for laden mules as is the whole line. From Sherwan to Savaldi there is also a good line of road. A force marching along the Atrak would after its arrival at Karez in the Atrak obtain command of this line, and be within easy reach of the large corn supplies of Koochan. From Boojnoord to Sevaldi is 35 miles and from Sevaldi to Karez in the Atrak 40 miles. From Sherwan to Sevaldi is 23 miles. The total of ascents and descents on the road from Boojnoord to the Atrak, as far as ascertained, is 8,400 feet; on the Sherwan road the total would be somewhat under 8,000 feet.APPENDIX IX. \ Referred to in paragraph 69, Chapter ///. ] MEMORANDUM OP RULES POR THE GUIDANCE OP THE SIRDARS AND NAIBS IN THE CONDUCT OF THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION OP THE KHELAT STATE. The following 1 rules for the guidance of the Sirdars and Naibs in conducting the civil administration of the Khelat State received the assent of His Highness the Khan of Khelat on the 1st August 1876 :— Whereas the late civil war created great difficulty in the administration of the Khelat State, which of late years, contrary to ancient usage, has been entirely in the hands of the Naibs, supported by a small body of regular troops, and whereas peace has been again restored to the country, I, Mir Khodadad Khan, Khan of Khelat, direct that the former civil admi nistration of the country be restored, and 1 publish the following rules which this day have received my assent for the guidance of my Sirdars and Naibs : The civil administration of the country is divided into four parts— 1. —Collection of revenue, whether in cash or in kind. 2. —Settlement of claims for money, &amp;c. 3. —The disposal of criminal cases. 4. —The protection of the civil power by the military. Regarding the first, I direct my Naibs not to interfere in any way with revenue-free grants. These are to remain, as formerly, entirely in the hands of the Brahuis. But should a Brahui purchase from a ryot land, on which revenue, either in cash or in kind, has been fixed, the Naib will collect from him the usual assessment Should any Brahui refuse to pay the assess ment to the Naib, the latter will at once refer to the Sirdar of the tribe to which the Brahui belongs, who will realise the amount due. Should the Sirdar consider the Brahuis had just grounds for refusing to pay the assessment, he will refer them to the Naib, and should the latter concur, the claim will be dismissed. Should the Naib not agree with the Sirdar, the latter can refer the dispute to His Highness the Khan, whose decision in the matter will be final, and the Sirdar will be responsible for putting it in force. After putting the Khan’s order in force, should the Sirdar consider the Khan’s order unjust, he can refer the matter through the Political Agent at Khelat to the British Government. The procedure recorded here applies to all disputes regarding the collection of revenue, whether in cash or in kind. 2. Money transactions, debts, &amp;e.—As a rule, when the plaintiff and defendant belong to one and the same tribe, the Sirdar of the tribe will, in accordance with ancient custom, hear and dispose of the case. In the event of the Sirdar’s decision giving dissatisfaction to either plaintiff or defendant, party dissatisfied can appeal to His Highness the Khan, whose decision shall be final. The Sirdar, on being informed of the Khan’s decision, must put it in force. In the event of a Hindu or Dewar complaining against a Brahui, the claim in the first in- stance must g*o before the Sirdar of the tribe. Should a settlement in which both sides concur be come to, well and good; if not, the claim will be brought by the complainant before the Naib, who will dispose of it according to State law. Appeal from the Naib’s order will lie to His Highness the Khan, whose decision is final, and must be carried out by the Sirdar. In the event of the plaintiff being a Brahui and the defendant a Dewar or Hindu, the claim in the first instance must be brought before the Naib, who will dispose of the case according to State law. From the Naib’s order an appeal will lie to His Highness the Khan, whose decision shall be final. The order of the Naib need not be put in force by the Sirdar until the Khan’s decision is known, then it must be put in force at once. 3. Regarding the disposal of all criminal cases.—Should plaintiff and defendant be Brahuis or Biluch and belong to the same tribe, the Sirdar will, according to ancient custom, dispose of the case. An appeal from his order will lie to His Highness the Khan, whose deci sion shall be final, and must be put in force by the Sirdar. In the event of the Sirdar not having the power for any cause whatever to enforce His Highness’ order, in that case he will apply to His Highness for help to enforce the order of the Khelat Government. Should the Sirdar consider the act of His Highness an oppressive one, he can complain to the British Government through the Political Agent. In the event of the complainant being a Dewar or Hindu and the defendant a Brahui, the case must go before the Naib, and the Sirdar on the Naib s application must seize the defendant and make him over to the Naib. The Sirdar can attend at the enquiry, and take part in it, and if the Naib and the Sirdar agree in the finding and sentence, they will together dispose of the case. Should they differ in opinion, the case will be. referred to His Highness the Khan for final orders, which will be binding on the Naib and Sirdar. Should a Brahui escape to any tribe after committing an offence, the Sirdar of that tribe is responsible to apprehend him, and to dispose of his offence in accordance with the procedure just recorded.4.

[ Referred to in paragraph 71, Chapter ///. ] MINUTE BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY, DATED 1st JULY 1876. Memorandum on Khelat. In circulating- these interesting papers, I think it expedient to accompany them with a brief review of the past and present condition of Khelat; the characters of the personages chiefly concerned in the public affairs of that Khanate; the policy adopted at various times by the British Government towards the Khan, and that which ought, in my opinion, to govern our future relations with His Highness and his Sirdars. 2. For this purpose I must necessarily re-state some facts with which my colleagues are already familiar; for their influence upon my own judgment cannot be clearly explained without preliminary reference to those facts. But my re-statement of them shall be as brief as possible. Early history of Khelat up to the reign of the present Khan. 3. The existing institutions of Khelat appear to date from about the middle of the 17th century, when the intervention of the Brahms, a warlike tribe, was invoked by the more peaceful inhabitants of the country, and government was either seized by, or offered to, the Chief of one of the principal Brahui clans. Since then the Khanate has descended, in almost uninterrupted direct succession, through nine Princes, to the present Ruler. Considering the wild and lawless character of the country, the maintenance of the succes sion for two hundred years in a single reigning family, is a fact of great significance; and this fact ought not, I think, to be ignored in the formation of our judgment as to the stability of the present Khan J s position. 4. The political institutions of the country were, and are, of a feudal character. The personal possessions of the Khan are comparatively small; but he is theoretically acknowledged * In 1838 Commander Careless was informed by by his Barons as their overlord with power to the Minister of the Jam of Lus Beyla that the Jam enter into treaties, make war and peace, receive could not transact business with a foreign power tribute and assistance in men and money from wTt; h ,:Xl^ bis feudatories, hear appeals a„d questions of 4,500 men, and to acknowledge the Khan’s para- life and do&amp;thj and determine tenitoridl CllS- mount authority. nutes.* 5. Practically, the power of the Khan has always depended on his personal character. There is not a district or tribe in Biluehistan which has not, at some time or other, successfully asserted its independence, or else become tributary to the Rulers of Persia, Cabul, Candahar, or Sind; whilst the Khans of Khelat themselves have at different times acknowledged feuda tory relations with Persia or Afghanistan. 6. The country, under its present institutions, has always been divided into two great provinces, called Sara wan and Jhalawan (answering to highlands and lowlands); the former embracing the Brahui tribes of Raisanis, Sherwanis, Mirwanis (the KhaAs tribe), Bangulzais, &amp;c., and the latter the Brahui clans of Minguls, Bezunjos, Zehris, Kaidranis, &amp;c. As additions were made from time to time to the Khelat territories, the new tribes or districts were incorporated in one or other of these two great divisions. 7. The predominating influence of the Raisanis and Zehris (Brahui tribes) w r as so great, as to command the association of their Chiefs with the Khan as hereditary councillors. The Chief of the Raisanis, for the time being, thus enjoyed the title of Sirdar of Sarawan, with a seat on the right hand of the Khan; the Chief of the Zehris being Sirdar of Jhalawan, with a seat on the left hand of the Khan. 8. Without the concurrence of these two Chiefs, nothing of importance was to be undertaken. But, in addition to them, the Khan was provided with a special Minister, whose office was also considered hereditary, and who was to be always chosen from the Dehwars. 9. The Dehwars are the original inhabitants of the country, who, together with the Juts, constitute the agricultural, and more peaceful, portion of its population. 10. The office of Prime Minister appears to have been made hereditary (according to the Brahui principle) in the Dehwar tribe, with a view to the conciliation of the older natioua element, and its incorporation into, the feudal system of the dominant race. 11. These three figures occupy a permanently prominent position in the history of Khelat, the two hereditary councillors as the champions of the nobles, and the hereditary Minister as the supporter of the Khan's personal authority.[ Ixxxi ] in 13. The history of this country is that of all feudal States. Itis a chronicle of turbulent ambitions and barbaric intrigues, engendered by a social chaos, out of which no cosmic' ' has yet been evolved; a sanguinary narrative of incessant defections and revolts incessart submissions and reconquests; the liarons fighting for their cherished liberty to be lawless the titular Elder unable to consolidate or develop his theoretical authority, and barely able to secure his personal safety by adroitly playing off this Chief or that tribe against some other tribe or Chiel. ^ 14. Nussir Khan the “great and good King' of Khelat story (who seems to have been a man of genius), succeeded to the throne in 1755 by deposing and murdering his elder brotner. It was the descendant of this elder branch that we tried to place on the throne in 1839. lo Nussir Khan, by the help of his son, consolidated the authority of his rule and extended the units of his territory, even occupying Kurrachee. About 1758 he had a quarrel with Ahmed bhah ot Afghanistan, who demanded tribute from him. After several severe battles the quarrel was settled by a matrimonial alliance, and a partial acknowledgment of Ahmed Shah s suzerainty. &amp; 16. Nussu Khan was succeeded in 179o by Mahmud Khan, under whose feeble rule the territories of Khelat were greatly reduced. * 17. He was succeeded by Mehrab Khan in 1819. This man, instigated by his Minister, Daud Mahomed, entered into a struggle for power with his nobles. Twenty-three of the most eminent Chiefs were sacrificed to the Ministers jealousy. A combination of the nobles expelled the Minister, but their subsequent dissensions recalled him. IS. In 1833, however, Daud Mahomed was finally overthrown, and succeeded by Mull a Mahomed Hosein, the son of one of Daud's first victims. Matters nevertheless went on much as before, till the intervention of the British, the storming of Khelat, and the death of Mehrab Khan in 1839. 19. It seems now generally admitted that this Khan was not to blame for the differences between himself and the British Government, which appear to have been entirely due to the double treachery of Mulla Maho med Hosein.* 20. On Mehrab Khan’s death the British Government attempted to place on the throne * Shah Newaz, the representative of the elder branch; hut after two years of anarchy and disorder, our nominee was murdered, and Nussir, the son of the late Khan, mounted the musnud with the assent of all parties.f 21. During the first year of his reign Sind was conquered and annexed by us; and Sir Charles Napier’s expedition against the Dumkis and Jakranis was undertaken, with the assent and co-operation of the Khan, in consequence of His Highness’ inability to maintain order. 22. Shortly after this, Sir J. (then Major) Jacob was placed in charge of the British frontier. He established the Dumkis and Jakranis as peaceful settlers on British territory; he nearly destroyed the Bugtis, and he gave peace and security to our border. 23. General Jacob’s policy has been the theme of universal praise; and the rival representatives of different official schools still appeal to it in support of the most opposite theories. Yet, so far as regards the internal affairs of Khelat, it is difficult to get from the immense mass of papers which refer to it a perfectly clear idea of what that policy was. But the most perverse of all the Philistines are those Medes and Persians whose “law altereth not, and General Jacob’s policy was probably variable according to circumstances. Its main features, however, appear to have been— \st } recognition of the Khans authority as the only one in Khelat invested with even an approximation to those powers and functions of sove reignty which are the essential conditions of international responsibility ; Znd, consequent support of that authority, and abstention from direct diplomatic intercourse with the Khans subjects; 3n/, maintenance of a strong personal influence over the Khan; and Uh, constant patrolling of the Sind Horse in Khelat territory. I can only find two records ot any open interference by General Jacob in the internal affairs of Khelat; once, in lS;).v, he mediated between the Khan and his Sirdars; and once again, in 1854, he obtained the Khan s assent to the Treaty which still stands in his name as a basis of our relations with Khe a . 22 *• “ Too late the papers were found which revealed the fact of the Khan’s innocence and the Minister’s perfidy ” — Oirdlestone. Mr. Thoxnton, however, Informs me that he has recently dis covered papers long huried in our archives, which prove that the Khan was quite as great a traitor to the British Government as his Minister, and that he richly deserved his fate. The discovery is interesting from an historical point of view, hut it has no political importance, or any practical bearing on the question of our present relations with Khelat. f In the draft Treaty between Sir A. Burnes and Mehrab Khan, the British Government pledged itself never to interfere between the Khan and his vassals, and more especially not to give assistance to Shah Newaz, whom nevertheless, before a year was over, we proclaimed Khan of Khelat, at the same time annexing Kutch and Gundava to Cabul![ Ixxxii ] 24. General Jacob seems to have had a very definite and vigorous border policy, and the Khan seems to have been very willing to let the General keep his frontier tribes in order for him. General Jacob's commanding personal character and distinct military policy were, in all respects, calculated to make a strong and salutary impression upon the imagination of rude and turbulent borderers. No doubt, also, his authority was indirectly strengthened hy recollections of the recent capture of Khelat, and the passage of British armies throughout Khelat territory in all directions, accompanied by such feats of arms as the nearly total annihilation of the Bugti tribe, on its return from one of its habitual raids, by Sir William (then Lieutenant) Merewether. But General Jacob appears to have been scrupulously reticent of interference in the internal affairs of the Khanate; and it was not till shortly before the end of Nussir Khan's reign, in 1856, that a British Agen‘, Major (now Sir Henry) Green, was sent to the * Some private letters written by that officer about three months 44 ,° 'I' I a lso observe ago, in explanation of his present views as to our political relations that (jreneral Jacob did not attempt with Khelat, are the only statesmanlike papers I have yet seen on this to hold the Khan responsible for acts subject, notwithstanding the voluminous official correspondence to Q-j-* depredation Committed 1)V th which It has given use. . Bugtis and other frontier tribes; but that he took his own measures against them, very energetically, and moved some of them bodily into British territory without reference to the Khan. 25. I can find no detailed record of the disturbances and revolts of this Khan's remn, but I presume that if was not without its natural share of such disorders. Major Jacob him self contrasts “ the peace and quietness within the British border with the anarchy, turbulence and danger to life and property beyond itand, in 1857, the Khan died, as it was supposed, by poison administered to His Highness by his Darogah, Gul Mahomed. 26. “The Chiefs of the State,' says Mr. Girdlestone, “ on learning of the Khan's death, repaired to Khelat, and chose Khodadad Khan, half-brother of the deceased, and son of Mehrab Khan. Khodadad Khan, who at this time was about 16 years of age, had previously, by reason of being considered the heir-apparent, passed a very secluded life. The turban of sovereignty was bound upon his head by Taj Mahomed, Sirdar of Jbalawan.' 27. It would appear from this and other passages in Mr. Girdlestone's memorandum that the Chiefs claim a right to elect their Khans, but that the election is a mere conventional fiction; the rightful succession in the reigning house having, in no instance that I can dis cover, been ever disregarded or opposed.' Khelat affairs from the accession of the present Khan to the Jacobabad mediation of 1872. 28. Khodadad Khan, the present Buler of Khelat, was placed upon the throne at a vrey early age, variously stated from 12 to 19. The commencement of his reign was ill-omened. His youth and inexperience made him especially dependent on the advice of his Minister. Gul Mahomed, the Minister, was an ambitious intriguer. His first object was, apparently, to * imbue the mind of the young Prince with distrust of the principal Chiefs, whom he treacher ously attacked under the walls of the citadel, where they had come to meet the Khan. The Chiefs, in self-defence, then took up arms against the Khan's authority. Through the. instrumentality of Major Green, who, though he disapproved the policy and opposed the influence of ihe Minister, prudently and efficiently supported the Khan; this quarrel was appeased, and the Chiefs returned to their allegiance. 29. In 1858 tne Khan visited Jacobabad, and there met Sir Bartle Frere and General Jacob. Gul Mahomed was dismissed, and the Shahgassi Wulli Mahomed was installed in his place as Wuzir. During the ensuing few years many difficulties and misunderstandings arose between the Khan and his nobles, but they were all settled without resort to arms, mainly owing to the mediation of Major Green. 30. In 1859 the Khan, under the advice and guidance of Major Green, personally * These strongholds had been previously deemed inaccessible. It headed an expedition against the is unfortunate that the good effects of this expedition were not Murris, which resulted, in the complete followed up, and that the power of the Murris has been allowed to submission of that turbulent tribe and T £ the destruction of their strongholds. In 1860 he made an armed progress through Mekran, which effected the complete pacification of that district in two months. These two events are apparently indicative of the good results which may be eftected by adequately supporting the Khan's authority and guiding his conduct, even though the Khan himself be weak and unpopular. re i^ n aS 1 ° 11 ^ ormer occasions, however, the Khan contrived to efface the good effects of his successes by offending the Chiefs who had helped him to enforce his power over re bellious tribes. He showed no disposition to recognize their rights or services, and he was ac cused, apparently with justice, of giving to vicious amusements the time which ought to have been employed in attention to public affairs.[ Ixxxiii J 33. In 1861 Major Green left KheGt , , n and, later, in 1862, by his brother, Major M Green ^ Captain Dickinson, the years from 1859 to 1861, the Khan^s general condnr-t t0 be ob f rved tliat , during- desire for the guidance, approval, and support of the British C C01 f ldered 80 good, his measures for the protection of trade so successful tW &gt; Government so manifest, and his additional allowance of Rupees 50,000 ov^bte\tT r ^iS; t ^ ^ effeotf upon Q thf °bX™ m ^ Sarawan and Jhalawan, with other ChX M aLmbSl eT , “““r’. , Th ?

The Agent, Major Malcolm Green^ hmvCTer Refused to hold any communication with the Chiefs, except through the Khan. ' e±USed 86. It will he observed that, up to this period, and indeed until the Jacobabad Con ference, ,t was the pohcy of the Bntish Government not to recognize the Sirdars of Khelat ai an independent, or y««-,ndependent power in that State, but totreat with them mdy ththl them overlord the Khan, and that tins policy was consistently maintained upon all occasion^ U 864 . Sii eied]l Khan was murdered, and Khodadad Khan, re-elected without opposition, was again installed on the musnud by Mulla Mahomed and Taj Mahomed the very Sirdars who had led the rebellion against him. J ’ . 38 ' T 1 l ’ e c t “ ,se o£ &lt; l uai ; rel ba ‘ween Taj Mahomed and Khodadad Khan appears to have been very like the supposed cause of quarrel between the Earl of Warwick and Edward IV namely, an msult offered by the Khan to the Sirdar’s daughter; and I may again observe that I can find no instance in which the troubles of the Khan’s reign can be fairly assigned to the discontent of an oppressed people, or to any other causes than those of personal difference between the Khan and the nobles, in which each party has been alternately in the rio-ht or the wrong. J v 39. After the murder of Sheredil Khan, Taj Mahomed, the Sirdar of Jhalawan was reconciled to Khodadad Khan by a matrimonial alliance, and the only Sirdar who then refused to recognize the Khan's restored authority was the Jam of Beyla, who is said to have been held m small esteem by the Chiefs of the Biluchi and Brabui tribes, to neither of which tribes he belonged. The conduct of this Sirdar, on the occasion of the Khan's restoration, is a subject which I reserve for future remark. 40. In November 1864 the British Government formally recognized the rule of Khodadad Khan, and restored to His Highness the Treaty subsidy of Rupees 50,000, on condition that the purposes for which it was originally granted should continue to he fulfilled by him. The chief purpose for which the Treaty subsidy was originally given was that of compensation to the Khan for the abolition of transit duties previously levied by him on merchandise. _ The political object of the arrangement was, of course, to prevent raids on or near British territory, and to protect merchants passing between British territory and Afghanistan. But on this occasion the British Government declined to revive the payment of the extra half lakh of rupees, which had been accorded to the Khan in 1859, and which in 1861 His Highness was declared to have well-merited. 41. This is a fact not to be lost sight of. I regard it as an important date in the history of our troubles with Khelat; for ever since our withdrawal of the extra half lakh of rupees the terms on which the Khan was entitled to the Treaty subsidy have not been satis factorily fulfilled by His Highness; and, to our repeated remonstrances against the non-fulfil ment of them, he has as repeatedly replied with great earnestness, and, so far as I can judge, with perfect sincerity, that our withdrawal of the extra half lakh has deprived him of the material means of carrying out his Treaty obligations; that the small subsidy of Rupees 50,000 a year does not reimburse his treasury for the loss sustained by it from the abolition of transit dues; and that it is insufficient to enable him to bribe to decent behaviour his greedy and turbulent subjects, or to maintain the military force necessary for the efficient punishment of their misconduct. 42. In 1865 the Jam, Nurdin, and Azad Khan of Kharan, rebelled, hut were defeated. In 1866 Taj Mahomed rebelled, but was defeated and captured, and Mulla Mahomed, under suspicion of being his accomplice, fled to Candahar. In 1867 laj Mahomed died in prison. In 1868 Mulla Mahomed returned, and was again defeated in an unsuccessful attempt at revolt.[ Ixxxiv ] 43. In that year Colonel Phayre succeeded Sir Henry Green as Political Superin tendent. About this time the Jam, with Nurdin and Azad Khan, again attempted another rebellion, in which IVIulla Mahomed, with the Sarawans and. Murri tribes, refused to join, although they did not support the Khan. 44 . In 1869 a mediation between these Chiefs and the Khan was attempted by Captain Harrison, who had in the meanwhile arrived as Political Agent. The statement of grievances submitted to our Agent by the disaffected Chiefs is very curious, and, but for the oriental names in it, that part of Mr. Girdlestone’s report in which this list of grievances is printed might almost be taken for an extract from any elementary text book on the early history of France or Fngland. The demands of the Khelat Barons were 1st .—That the Khanate should be constituted as to laws and government after the form prevalent in the days of the first Nussir Khan. Znd .—That the Khan should disband his mercenary troops. 3rd .—That compensation should be given by the Khan for the murder of Taj Mahomed. Uk .—That the right of election to the Khanate should be re-affirmed as hereditary in the Chief do ms of Jh ala wan. bth .—That the Chiefs should have the right of appointing or dismissing the Khan's Minister. Qt/i .—That their ancient constitutional authority in the Civil and Military Councils of the State should be restored to them. 7th .—That the British Government should recognize its Treaty rights to be with the Khan as head of the Brahui Confederacy, and not as a personal Sovereign. 45. As these demands appear likely to be revived “in such a questionable shape that we must answer them / 5 I may as well observe, in passing, that the rigid maintenance of old Baronial rights in a feudal society is not conducive to strong government, or settled order, and that the establishment of strong government and settled order in Khelat are objects too important to be trilled with by British policy. As regards, however, the essentially feudal complaint against the maintenance of mercenary troops by the Khan, it would appear, from Colonel Ph ay re's precis and Captain Harrison's reports, that the Khan has sufficient lands and revenues of his own for the support of a small military force not provided by his Barons; and that it is not true, as stated by the Barons, that these troops are enter tained by the proceeds of lands and other sources of revenue belonging to them. But, independently of this consideration, the power of the Khan to maintain at least the nucleus of a small standing army, on whose loyalty and discipline he can rely, is, in my opinion, an essential condition to the maintenance of his authority, or indeed of any permanent authority, in Khelat. I think it should be our policy not only to preserve, but to somewhat strengthen, develop, and partially place under our own control, this solitary guarantee for the Khan's power to maintain orderly administration, and carry out his Treaty obligations to the British Government. ^ 6 . As regards the claim to compensation for the imputed murder of Taj Mahomed, I consider it absolutely untenable, and I confess that I am seriously alarmed by Major Sande- man's apparent disposition to encourage and support the revival of such a claim. In the first place, the accusation on which it rests was fully examined into at the time by the Political Superintendent of the British Government; and careful enquiry, conducted under our own authority, by our own officers, failed to elicit any evidence against the Khan. In the second place, Taj Mahomed, who died under the circumstances of mystery which usually accompany death in prison, had been most properly deprived of his liberty when taken in arms against the lawful ruler of the country at the head of a formidable rebellion, which was the third wherein he had been actively engaged. His imprisonment gave immediate peace to the disturbed con dition of Biluchistan, and Sir Henry Green, who had exceptionally good opportunities of correctly judging the man's character, has recorded his conviction that “ a more desperate intriguer or a greater traitor did not exist in any Native Court in Asia; and, so long as he remained at large, His Highness the Khan's position could never have been safe.' If the. Supreme Government now adopts the advice which Major Sandeman seems anxious to urge on its adoption, and requires from the Khan the restoration, to this Sirdar's disaffected descendants, of lands lawfully confiscated for treason and rebellion against his own person, in acknowledgment of a murder which has never been proved, and of which no Prince could, without humiliation, publicly acknowledge himself guilty, it will, in my opinion, inflict upon the Khan an undeserved humiliation, sure to be deeply resented, seriously weaken his autho- rity, and commit itself to a very perilous precedent. 47. After the failure of Captain Harrison's mediation, the Jam, who had returned to his country, rose in arms with Nurdin against the Khan, but was promptly defeated by the \v uzir, and forced to take refuge in 8 ind, where the British authorities detained him in a sort of honorable confinement. Mulla Mahomed, his other confederate, fled to the Murri Hills, and thence to Cabul, where he endeavoured to induce the Ameer to espouse his cause. from this time we may date the unfortunate rivalry between the Punjab and the kmd systems of policy, and their official representatives. Mulla Mahomed's case was referred[ Ixxxv ] Bombay Government. 1 oanaeman, and the Sind authorities of the Captain Sandeman's official dealings with the Mnrri* u j i n , , . . contact with Khelat politics. ° Mums and Bugt.s had brought him mb. In regard to Mul [ a Mahomed’s statements and complaints, received through the Ameer Captam Sandeman and the Sind authorities appear to have addressed to the Supreme Gove™: men conflicting reports; and the Supreme Government, instead of acting upon either of them left the Ameer s communication w.thout any reply. 1 believe it has since been renewed bni 49 About thrs time Colonel Phayre seems to have thought it his duty to espouse the cause of the disaffected Sirdars against the Khan, and he even suggested that they should receive from the British Government material support in vindication of, what he termed, •■them just rights. Whether the views held by Colonel Phayre were right or wrong (and to me they seem indicative of a total absence of political sagacity), there can be no doubt that he allowed those views to m due ace his official conduct in indirect opposition to the policy then as previously, mamtamed by the British Government, and the repeated remonstrances of Sh W Merewether, through whom, as Commissioner of Sind, he received his instructions As Captam Harrison at the same time, m accordance with Sir W. MerewetheHs policy, no less * The Khan now, of course, finds his advantage w&lt;| rruly supported the authority of the Khan,* it must have become apparent, both to His Highness and to the Sirdars, that the counsels of the Bri tish Government were divided, and its own autho rities antagonistic to each other. in abusing Sir W. Merewether and Captain Harrison to Major Sandeman, and that ardent .'young officer seems unable to perceive the transparent purpose of this abuse. 50. The Mum and Bugti tribes occupy territory in Khelat, which touches Sind on the one hand, and the Punjab on the other. In February 1871 difficulties and differences of opinion as to tbe treatment of these troublesome neighbours resulted in the Mithancote Confer ence. In that Conference it was agreed that the British Government should subsidise the Murris and Bugtis from Sind, without reference to the Khan, and that Captain Sandeman, as a medium of communication with these tribes only, should be placed under the official autho rity of the Commissioner of Sind. 51. Iu September 1871 a formidable rebellion broke out in the Sarawan country, stimu lated by Mulla Mahomed and Nurdin. The Khan’s troops soon got the upper hand of the rebels, and, after some negotiation, hostilities were suppressed by tbe intervention and pro posed mediation of tbe British authorities. 52. Early in the following year, 1872, Sir W. Merewetber, Colonel Phayre, and Captain Sandeman were authorized to meet each other at Jacobabad, investigate the complaints of the Sirdars, and mediate between them and the Khan. The Government of Bombay remonstrated strongly against this mediation, as sure to prove dangerously detrimental to the Khan’s position. Here the antagonism, which had so long been smouldering between the political opinions and personal dispositions of the Sind and Punjab officials, burst into public and irreconcilable conflict, which resulted in the removal of Colonel Phayre, and orders obliging Captain Sandemau to return to his station. 53. Sir W. Merewether was thus left to conclude the mediation alone. It was a mediation commenced in opposition to the views of the local Government, and on terms certainly inconsistent with the policy previously approved by the Supreme Government. I cannot say that this latent defect in tbe whole position appears to me to have been remedied by the discretion of Sir W. Merewether in his conduct, or rather his conclusion, of the mediation. His decision left both parties equally dissatisfied ; nominally, it was, in tbe main, against tbe Sirdars ; but the Khan was deeply offended and incensed by a mediation which admitted bis rebellious Sirdars to be heard and treated by the British Government as bis equals; and be vented bis displeasure at tbe result on his own Minister, Wulli Mahomed, who bad represented him at tbe Conference. The Sirdars, on the other band, discovered from this Conference that they could reckon on the warm support of one party amongst tbe English officials, and from that moment they have been more intractable than ever. 54 . I trace the origin of our present difficulties entirely to this unfortunate Conference at Jacobabad; the policy then inaugurated is so apparently absurd, and its consequences have been so persistently disastrous, that I must here pause to consider somewhat more closely tbe character and circumstances of this event.' Jacobabad mediation of 1872. 55. Up to this date the policy of tbe British Government in Khelat was, as we have seen, tolerably consistent. In a subsequent part of the present note I shall indicate the cause, to which alone its inadequate success appears to me attributable. 23[ Ixxxvi ] In 1869, when Captain Harrison came forward as a mediator, the Supreme Government whilst recognizing' his prudence and courage, warned him against the danger of putting him self again in a similar position, and pointed out to him that a British A&lt;rent, who becomes an arbiter between a foreign Prince and his feudatories, runs great risk of entangling himself and his Goyernment in the most embarrassing complications. 56. From precisely the same point of view the Governor of Bombay remonstrated against the Jacobabad mediation. In a telegram to the Supreme Government, dated the 27th January 1872, he says—“ If I am to understand that the Commissioner is to offer mediation between the parties,I request further instructions,.as I believe it will subvert Khan's authority and perpetuate troubles.' The terms of that mediation are well known, and I need not here recapitulate them, hut they were, in my opinion, singularly unfortunate. They gave to the Sirdars a status which the Sirdars had never held before ; they taught the Khan's disaffected vassals that there was a party in our Government favorable to their claims; and they unhappily disclosed the mischievous antagonism which has never since ceased to exist between the Sind and the Punjab authorities. It developed a barbaric squabble into an official epic. The Trojan war would probably have been of brief duration had the conduct of it been left to the craft and cruelty of ordinary mortals. But certain bellicose divinities espoused the rival claims of Argives and Trojans, and took a pleasure of their own in prolonging the conflict. In the same wav, our Sind and Punjab officers have transferred to the Olympian altitudes of the Supreme Govern ment a series of miserable quarrels, only appropriate to their barbarian birth-place. 57. But it is the proposed method of enforcing the wonderful conditions of this ill- omened mediation which has most excited my amazement. The Commissioner decides that the rebellious Sirdars are to be restored to all the rights forfeited by their rebellion, and replaced in full and peaceable possession of their estates, on condition ( 1 ) that all the property plundered by them from the kafilas be given up to its lawful owners; and ( 2 ) that all the property seized by them and their followers from the ryots of Biluchistan during the late rebellion be similarly restored. These may have been fair conditions; but how does the Commissioner proceed to enforce them ? First, he replaces the rebels in free possession of their for eited revenues and lands, and then he calls, not upon them, but upon the Minister of the Khan, to carry into effect the restoration of the stolen property ! Was there ever such a parody of arbitration ? Yet our first and chief complaint against this unhappy Khan is, that “ he has not exerted himself to recover the said property.' We replace the Khan's most turbulent and rebellious subjects in the full possession, guaranteed by our own authority, of all their original means of offence and defence; we forbid the Khan, on peril of incurring our displeasure, to interfere with this arrangement; we withdraw from him the pecuniary assistance which, in even ordinarily easy times, had been found necessary to enable him to keep his vassals in order; we leave him with his hands tied, his power crippled, his authority undermined, his self-esteem humiliated, his confidence alienated; and then his failure to compel these rewarded rebels to disgorge their plunder is actually the cause assigned by us for withdrawing our Agent from his Court. 58. The view taken by Sir W. Merewether of the assistance given to the Khan on this occasion is exceedingly curious. Speaking of subsequent depredations on caravans, he says r “ As a true friend of the Khan, I cordially aided him at Jacobabad to promote that recovery, to enable him to adhere to the terms of the Treaty as regarded, first, kafilas plundered by Sirdars' people; and regarding last plundered by Murris, I was quite ready to do the same.' 59. Is it to be wondered at that the Khan “showed indifference in respect to the pro perty' taken by the Sarawan Sirdars ?' Is it to be wondered at that he “ persisted in looking at the matter in the above light (namely, as a joke, vi&lt;ie Major Harrison's reports) ?' That he afterwards turned sulky and refused to move in the matter at all? Or that, when visited by Major Sandeman, he gave “a most disagreeable smile' on the Major alluding to the conditions of peace granted to the Sirdars in 1872, and said that those conditions were such as could never be fulfilled ? Is it surprising that he detected and resented the plain drift of our “friendly mediation?' Is he to be blamed if he perceived that the result of this mediation was to saddle him with the whole responsibility of acts done by his personal enemies in the course of an open rebellion against him, after we had interfered to prevent him from suppressing and punishing that rebellion in his own way, and obliged him not only to pardon, but virtually to reward, on terms dictated by^ ourselves, the perpetrators of the acts for which we then held him responsible ? Is it unnatural that he should have turned with bitter and ineradicable resentment against the unlucky Minister, who had the misfortune to represent his person and his interests on an occasion so humiliating' to the one, so disastrous to the other ? * lor^ my own part, I can feel no surprise at such conduct and such sentiments on the part of the Khan. What does surprise me, is the almost incredible fact that, throughout the whole of the subsequent official correspondence on this subject, the refusal of the Sirdars to restore the plundered piopeity is never once mentioned as a cause of grievance against them, or a reason[ Ixxxvii ] for taking measures to compel them to fulfil the conditions their own property, but always as a grievance against the Khan on his part. upon which we restored to them and a breach of engagement 60.

N ”^“ i, ' clud «l in the mediation of Jacobabad, but he was subsequently defeated by Wulh Mahomed, and surrendered on the promise that his life should be spared if he restored the property plundered by him during the late disturbances. The Khan had been required to enforce restitution of the property plundered by his rebellious Sirdars This he failed to do. We pressed him, and be became sulky. We also made him answerable for not repressing disturbances m Lus Beyla, a district in the armed possession of one of his principal rebels and bitterest enemies; and, at the present moment, the attempt to enforce his authority in Lus Beyla is made by Major Sandeman a serious charge against His Hiobness Disturbances soon occurred between the Murris and the Minguls. Caravans were plundered' We demanded compensation from the Khan, and the Khan took no notice of our demand’ professing his inability to comply with it. The Khan, as already mentioned, had entirely withdrawn his confidence from his old Minister, Wulli Mahomed, in consequence of that Ministers part in the unfortunate mediation of 1872. Our Agent, Captain Harrison, is supposed to have advocated the cause of the Minister with a warmth that went, perhaps, beyond discretion. This is the only circumstance in which 1 can find even the ghost of a justification for the ungrateful and improper language of the Khan's allusions to Major Harrison in his reply to Lord. Northbrook's letter. But, believing at the time that his interests, which were certainly not successfully asserted, had been betrayed by Wullee Mahomed in the mediation of 1872, it is, I think, natural that the Khan should'have been confirmed in that belief by Major Harrison's somewhat ostentatious support ofithe Minister, and should have become all the more anxious to get rid of him. 62. A first threat of withdrawing our Agent extorted from the Khan the payment of a certain amount of compensation and the dismissal of the obnoxious Ministers whom he had taken in place of Wulli Mahomed. But matters grew steadily worse; outrage followed outrage, and no satisfaction could be obtained by us; a daring inroad was made by some Brahui tribes on British territory; it remained unredressed ; the Khan's subsidy was stopped, and our Agent withdrew from his Court, bringing with him the ex-Minister, Wulli Mahomed. Sir W. Merewether then recommended an armed intervention in Khelat and the deposition of the pre sent Khan. The confidence of the Supreme Government in Sir William Merewether's judgment appears to have been seriously, and I think not unnaturally, shaken by this proposal. That the proposal was inexpedient I entertain no doubt whatever; but I think that fair allowance must be made for such a failure in patience on the part of an officer whose patience had been severely tried by years of aggravation on the part of the Khan, and an official experience which justified the belief that the British Government was not disposed to incur the expense and responsibility of actively consolidating the authority of the present Khan, whose power it had virtually done much to weaken, and from whose weakened power the pacification of Khelat could no longer be expected. The rest of the story is to be read in the Government Resolution of the 16th October 1875, and the reports of Major Sandeman, to whose mission 1 will now refer. Major Sandeman s mission. 63. In reading through the enormous mass of official papers on the subject of our relations with Khelat, which, with scant intermission, have occupied my . ^ rn ® an . 10Ut5 „ 1 s during the last three months, I have frequently found cause to appiecia c e wis om o a maxim attributed to our shy friend, the King of Burmah. “ Iheie is to everj mg, says . is Majesty, “a beginning, a middle, and an end. Ton should never go e yon ie e &amp; innm &amp; until you are sure of the middle; when you get to the middle, you s on nevei oq,e e beginning; and neither at the beginning nor the middle should you ever ose sig o It appears to me that, in the middle of our relations with Khelat, we ha ve sometimes forgotten the beginning; at least, between onr policy at one time and our policy at another there seems to be a complete solution of continuity ; and I greatly fear that, «t ‘he preset moment, we are in some danger of being hurried, or beguded towards an not ckariy foreseen, or deliberately desired. Such, at least, is the strong unpussion , ,, f rom the anxious perusal of Major Sandeman’s latest reports and the accompanying letter trom the Punjab Government.Ixxxviii ] In the month of May 1875 it was decided to send Captain Sandeman into the Murri Hills for the settlement of some of onr disputes with those tribes, and the objects of his mission were defined by the Resolution of the 16th October 1875. 64. He started on the 22nd November, and his subsequent proceeding’s, up to the period of his return to Jacobabad on the 28th January, are narrated by himself in his Report of the 5th February 1876. In his manag'ement and account of this mission I observe the same characteristics that are noticeable in his conduct and languag-e on former occasions—great self-confidence ; consider able courage and energy; impetuosity ; vanity; a marked disposition to generalize hastily, and jump to conclusions on very imperfect data; an enthusiastic temperament, unguided by sound judgment and uninformed by political insig’ht; constant one-sidedness of view; the over readiness of a sanguine and generous nature to believe what it hopes and what it wishes; an inconvenient preference for expressing opinions, when what is required from him are verified facts, on which the opinions of others may be formed ; coupled with this, a most offensive style of correspondence, and an inveterate disregard of all authority, with which his own views and sentiments are not in sympathy. Judging of this officer's character, solely from its portrait as drawn by his own hand, I recognize in it many estimable qualities; but the defects of his judgment and temperament render him, in my opinion, an unsafe negotiator, and a not very trustworthy observer. 65. A celebrated French cook once gave this parting injunction to his aide-de-cuisine : Surtont ne poussez pas le poivre jusqu’au fanaUsme. Major Sandeman's faith in his pepper box is almost fanatical. Never, in the whole course of my diplomatic experience, have I met with an Agent so apparently in need of Talleyrand's advice : Pas de zele. In justice to this officer, however, I feel bound to add that, even were Major Sandeman as judicious as Hooker, and Sir W. Merewether as patient as Job, I hardly see how the instructions given to the former could have failed in provoking a collision between them. 66 . Whether or no Major Sandeman exceeded his instructions in going to Khelat, is a disputed question. But I think it scarcely disputable that, whatever interpretation his instruc tions can be made to bear, they were not originally intended to lead him so far. The Office Notes of those who drafted the instructions indicate this clearly. Mr. Henvey says —“ the scope of the orders was so wide as almost to give Captain Sandeman carte blanche. But the only point which may be said to have been altogether out side Captain Sandeman's instructions was the relations of the Khan to the British Govern ment.' And he adds—“ Captain Sandeman undoubtedly exceeded his instructions in this respect.' Again, commenting on a despatch of Sir W. Merewether’s, Mr. Aitchison says,— “ Captain Sandeman has not been instructed to interfere in the revolution said to be impend ing ; but, on the contrary, he has been instructed not to interfere.' Yet, in his telegram of 1st January Captain Sandeman virtually claims to have prevented an outbreak; and, although in his Khelat Diary notes he denies all knowledge on the part of himself and the Sarawan Vide also Colonel Munro’s report, paragraph 11 . Sirdars of conspiracy against the Khan, yet he forwards with the same report a letter from the Sarawan and Murri Chiefs, stating that they were about to collect their forces and fall upon the Khan's troops; but that, at his request, they agreed to accompany him, instead of commencing hostilities. 67. Captain Sandeman's report throws wonderfully little light on the state of affairs in Khelat. * The language of the Khan and Sirdars, in their communications with Major Sandeman, is the language commonly held by barbaric Chiefs to enthusiastic young English officers on the frontiers of other parts of the British dominions which are bordered by uncivilized tribes. They are all animat ed by the best disposition towards the British Gov ernment; they do not rob and kill for the love of larceny and homicide, but from poverty; all their past misdeeds are solely attributable to the bad advice of Colonel A, or the cruelty of Governor B, and they desire nothing better than to follow hence forth in peace the good advice of the intelligent and sympathising young gentleman who now correctly understands their true position and genuine senti ments, &amp;c. He was, naturally, welcomed by the Mnrris and the Brahui Chiefs, to many of whom he was personally known, and to whose cause he was notoriously friendly. These Chiefs had every thing to gain, and nothing to lose, by his media tion. He was, no less naturally, received by the Khan with courtesy, if not warmth; for the Khan was anxious to re-open communications with the British Government, and saw that he could partly enlist the sympathies of Major Sandeman, by lajnng all his difficulties at the door of the Sind authorities.* 68 . Major Sandeman accepted every statement made by the Sirdars against the Khan and every statement made by the Khan against the Sind authorities, without, in either case, a emp ing to investigate it, or to learn what could be said upon the other side of it. Not a sing e complaint, however vague, does he verify; not a single story, however absurd or suspi cious, has been sifted out by him. On the 9th of January he telegraphs —“ Have fully discovered true causes which keep, country m slate of anarchy.”[ Ixxxix ] Such a discovery would have been in must have awaited with deep interest the report recordin^if^ TW ^ Govern ment of India whatever on the state of the country, pastor nreqenf ^ ^ r fP ort throws no light of facts, but it does not even give us a clear and coT^’f I ^ lt5 ^ lve us 110 anal y si s 69. And, although on thf 9th of JanuaTls S M s 7 1 f ^ he had “fully discovered the true cause, of alarchv” ,h W, « s «l,»P!&gt;a»n%, that 4th of May 1876, he dwells upon “ the absolute ^ a recent kttel h dated the ,me ^ ^ to may be allowed “plenty of time” Thus, it will be observed that Maior Squrlomon of time to ascertain clearly the true character of the t | ,ovv ^-'piires an indefinite length agotosettk ^ “^rve^s^rt lodm for the gmdance of its judgment, contain a most urgent demand for the ewesln of an unhmited confidence in h,s own judgment, coupled with an official assurance that whaTeve“ action may be taken by him on h,s present avowedly imperfect knowledge of “ the time causes of the anarchy he proposes to heal, will be “ hact-pd «« n,* 7 7 7 , &amp;e ?

It is obvious that the Khan could not have dared to offer open opposition to all his Sirdars, united against him under the patronage, and with the active support, of a British officer whom he supposed to be the p empotentiary of the British Government. He would at that time have submitted to any condition, however onerous, and undertaken any obligation, however unjust or imprac ticable it might have been m his own opinion ; trusting to subsequent circumstance and a model ate amount of craft to enable him to slip out of all inconvenient engagements^ as soon as the immediate pressure of the occasion and the personal presence of the British plenipoten tiary were withdrawn. 1 But, in the meanwhile, rumours from Jacobabad offered him another, and a speedier chance of escape. It appeared from these rumours that the supposed plenipotentiary was only an insubordinate official out of bound; and a plain question put by the Khan to Major Sande- man obliged the latter to acknowledge that he had no accredited diplomatic position, or powers, at the Court of His Highness. © ^72. I must say that this officers letters and reports do not inspire me with confidence in his judgment, or foresight. Neither do I find in them the least trace of anything I can call a policy, the faintest indication of an intelligent, or intelligible, conception of the form which our permanent relations with Khelat are to assume; the principle on which they are to rest; the manner in which they are to be maintained; the result to which they are to tend, or the situa tion in which they will ultimately place us. 73. The general results of Major Sandeman’s first mission seem to be, first, that he had a good opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with all the leading Sarawan Sirdars, and learning from their own lips the character of their complaints against the Khan; secondly, that British mediation was welcomed by them; thirdly, that even the Murris expressed their willingness to become peaceable subjects of the Khan in the event of the difficulties between His Highness and his Sirdars being adjusted to their satisfaction; fourthly, that the Sarawan Sirdars and Murri Chiefs were induced to make a conditional submission to the Khan; fif thly, that the Khan himself professed his willingness to submit to British mediation. Although, not liking to place himself unconditionally in the hands of an officer whose official position was dubious, and whose authority was avowedly restricted, His Highness preferred to submit his case directly to the Government; sixthly and lastly, that an opportunity was thus afforded to the Khan to address the Government in submissive terms, thereby facilitating the renewal of friendly communications between the Government and himself. 74. The Government of India, on receipt of Major Sandeman’s report, decided, in accordance with the advice given it by Colonel Munro and the Punjab Government, that it Was worth while to take advantage of the opening thus offered, and allow Major Sandeman to make another attempt at mediation, with the advantage this time of enlarged instructions and a recognized position. 75. The views of the Government are embodied in the Resolution of 14th March, Ho. 671 (a) B, which says that, “ il Colonel Munro is satisfied that the Khan and his piincipalChiefs are ready to accept arbitration, be is authorized to arrange for a meeting between Major Sandeman, the Khan, and his Sirdars, to attempt to carry out the objects of the .Resolution of the 16th October last * * * In short, the Government of India, having confidence in Colonel Munro and Major Sandeman, desires that the latter be allowed, under the Commissioners orders, full opportunity of effecting, under the most favorable circum stances, a settlement of Khelat affairs. - ” 76. This was communicated to Colonel Munro, who telegraphed in reply“ Major Sandeman proceeds to arrange for safe passage of returning kafilas through Bolan, and to satisfy me that Khan and Jhalawan Sirdars all agree to accept mediation before it is attempted” In his official letter of the 4th April, Colonel Munro similarly describes the objects of Major Sandeman's present mission as being, firstly, to escort the caravans through the Bolan • and, secondly, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether all parties are ready to accept arbitration with a view to a future meeting in Kutchee between the British Commissioner (himself, or Major Sandeman ?) and the Khan of Khelat, for the purpose of mediation. 77. If this be a correct view of Major Sandeman’s instructions, they give him less power even than he believed himself to possess on the occasion of his former mission. 78. The instructions certainly appear to roe somewhat loose and vague; hut it is clear that Major Sandeman does not consider his duties, under those instructions, confined to ascer taining whether the Khan and his Sirdars are willing to accept arbitration; nor do I myself think that his present instructions, fairly interpreted, put any such limitation upon the object of his mission. At the same time, I am of opinion that it would be most dangerous to allow Major Sandeman to place before either the Khan, or the Sirdars, and to urge upon their acceptance, as he apparently believes himself authorized to do, any terms of arbitration which have not been previously submitted in detail to the Government of India, or carefully con sidered and deliberately sanctioned by the Viceroy. 79. I must, in this place, call attention to the tone of Colonel Munro's letter of instruc tions to Major Sandeman which abounds in insinuations and allusions to other Government officers, both offensive and uncalled for. 80. Before proceeding to notice the results, up to the present moment, of Major Sande- maffis second mission, it null be convenient to review, parenthetically, the character and antecedents of the principal personages in Khelat, to whom reference is made in that officers reports. Khelat. Principal actors in the recent event. 81. (1.) The Khan. —Mr. Henvey calls the Khan a “perfidious scoundrel,” and His Highness was described, in the official reports of 1858, as a “feeble, false, and cunning boy.” He is supposed to have been a party to the poisoning of his half-brother, the late Khan, and has certainly not proved a successful ruler. Sir Henry Green, who appears to have had the best personal opportunities of studying his character, reports him to be difficult to deal with, capricious, and unstable, but probably no worse than the average of Native rulers. Recently, the Khan has “ mentioned Sir Henry Green’s name with gratitude, saying he was an officer who had for several years mediated between him and his Sirdars, and had, during his stay, kept the peace between the two sides.” Sir William Merewether speaks of the Khan as being capricious and vindictive, but always earnest in his endeavours to remain friends with the British Government, and sincere in his disposition to meet its wishes to the best of his ability. He is also praised by the same authority for having had the good sense to select, and keep for 15 years, an admirable Minister. 82. ( 2 .) Mull a Mahomed, Sirdar of Sarawan. —Sir William Merewether seems to have at first formed a good opinion of this Sirdar, but to have soon come to the conclusion that he w T as a “ hopeless traitor.” Forced by his position to the head of the feudal party, Mulla Mahomed appears in every disturbance which has distracted Khelat during the reign of the present Khan, whom he has persistently opposed. Latterly, Mulla Mahomed seems to have been living mostly in exile, and on one occasion he appealed to the Ameer of Cabul to take up his giievances against the Khan. Major Sand email’s personal acquaintance with Mulla Mahomed does not appear to be of long standing; but this Sirdar seems to have made a very favorable impression upon the Major, whom he has accompanied in both his missions, as the head of the Sirdars, and the favored representative of their cause. S3. (3.) la) ' Mahomed, Sirdar of Jhalawan. —He at first supported the Khan, but quanelled with His Highness on account of an insult to his daughter, and rebelled against nun m 1861.

But in the year 1865 he made common cause against the Khan with the Jam of Lus Beyla, to whom he was closely related, and, from that time to the day of his death, there was not a revolt or conspiracy, m which he did not participate. He was excluded from the terms of the arbitra- tion of 1872 ; but he subsequent y surrendered, and was admitted by the Khan to all the benefits of it. bor some unexplained reason he was placed in charge of Lus Beyla when the Jam and his family had taken refuge m Sind; but he was called up to Khelat fust before Major Sandemau s arnvul there, kept aloof from the Brahuis during the negotiations, and was killed by the Khan s orders just after Major San deman’s departure. 86 . . ( 6 .) Azad Khan, Nowsherwani, and father-in-law of the late Nussir Khan. —He holds a district (Kharan) in the Province of Punjgur tax-free, on condition of military service and allegiance. He, however, at one time professed allegiance to the Cabul Government; at anothei, to the Khan of Khelat; at another, to the Shah of Persia. He has never been true for long to either of the three; but, by playing off one power against another, he has con stantly sought to attain the object of his ambition, which appears to be the sovereignty of Khelat. Towards the British Government his enmity has been unceasing. He sided with the Persians against us in the war of 1857, and, during the mutiny, he urged the Khan to seize that opportunity of “driving the Feringees into the sea.” lie has repeatedly joined the Sirdars in their revolts against the Khan without the smallest pretext. He was driven by them out of the country, at Major Green’s instigation, in 1868. He appeals to Cabul for x , support whenever he finds himself in difficulties, that in two months it will march an army against lecently, he has been trying to mix himselt him. up in Major Sandeman’s negotiations.* 87. ; (7.) Wulli Mahomed, W'uzir. —Is not one of the nobles, but belongs to a family which, for generations, has held confidential posts about the Court. He fought by the side of Mehrab Khan against us when Khelat was taken, and his two brothers were killed on that occasion. Since then, however, he always appears to have been firm and faithful in his friend ship with the British Government. With the approval of General Jacob, and Mr. (now Sir Bartle) Frere, he was, in 1857, appointed Minister to the young Khan. Energetic and faith ful, both to his Chief and to us, he supported the Khan throughout the long struggle between His Highness and his revolted nobles; but, as before mentioned, the unfortunate Jacobabad Conference of 1872 proved fatal to his influence over the Khan, who dismissed him from office in 1873. Since then, the Khan has never ceased to revile the ex-Minister, and has, even by his complaints, induced Colonel Munro to remove him from Jacobabad.

I may now resume the narrative of Major Sandeman s mission. Major Sandeman’s second mission. 89. Major Sandeman left Jacobabad on the 4th of April with a force of about 800 men; but was delayed on his march by a severe outbreak of cholera, and did not reach Must g, Ms present camp, until the end of that month. In the meanwhile, he had written to t^ Jhalawan Sirdars, inviting their co-operation on behalf of his paci c e or s. i i ^ were not at first very encouraging, as they one and all of them declared that peace could onlybe secured by deposing the Khan, or annexing the country. Later communications, however have been received from them by Major Sandeman, in which, apparently, under the advice of Mulla Mahomed, they place their case unreservedly in the hands of the British Agent. The Sara wan Sirdars have also signed an agreement to the same effect. 90. The Khan, on his part, at first showed reluctance to meet Major Sandeman at Mustung, suggesting that the Major should meet him at Khelat • but, on receipt of the letters addressed to him by the Viceroy and the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, His Highness consented to meet Major Sandeman at Mustung on one condition, which is not very intelli gible to me, namely, that the terms granted to him should be the same as those offered in 1872. I say that this condition is not very intelligible to me, because it was especially against those terms that the Khan inveighed at the meeting between himself and Major Sandeman last year. If the condition has been accurately reported to us, I can only account for it by supposing that Major Sandeman's known views, his re-appearance with seemingly unrestricted authority, and the support of an armed British force, together with the knowledge that this officer can, at any moment, unite all the Chiefs and tribes in open rebellion against the Khan, may have caused Plis Highness to fear that, if he does not secure a preliminary recognition of the terms of 1872, he may be forced to accept worse ones, under a threat of deposition if he rejects them. According to later advices from Mustung, the Khan has visited Major Sandeman, unconditionally, at his camp there, and Major Sandeman was confident of arriving at a satisfactory understanding with His Highness; but it is clear from all Major Sandeman’s letters, reports, and telegrams, that he does not recognize the limits apparently assigned to his instructions by Colonel Munro. 91. Throughout Major Sandeman/s letters and diaries I can find no sign of a suspicion on his part that the rebellious Sirdars are in any way to blame. No evidence against them receives from him a moment's attention. At the same time, I observe that he rarely misses an opportunity of declaiming against the policy of the Sind authorities. 92. Now, whether this policy was well or ill-carried out, it was, at least so far as it went, in accordance with a principle which I believe to be not only sound, but absolutely essen tial to any satisfactory relations with Khelat; the principle, namely, of strengthening and supporting, rather than weakening and discrediting, the Khan's authority. In saying this, however, I trust 1 shall not be thought to approve of any acts, or omissions, on the part of our authorities which might have the effect of associating the British Government with maladministration, treachery, or injustice, on the part of the Khan. We owe a primary duty to our own character. If, therefore, our support of the Khan's sovereign, or semi-sovereign, authority be efficient, his obedience to our advice should be implicit, and we are bound to enforce our influence over His Highness in a manner conducive, not merely to the consolidation of his power, but to the just and salutary exercise of it, with due regard to the interests of his subjects, and the fair rights of all his vassals. 93. In his diary of the 5th of May, Major Sandeman says that the Jhalawan Sirdars (who were such pertinacious and inveterate rebels that the British Government excluded them from the arbitration of 1872) “are perfectly reasonable in what they ask, viz., honorable terms of peace, and the restoration of lands confiscated by His Highness.” In his letter of the 24th of May he says that “ the Khan, for many years past, was led by our advice and support to adopt a policy in the State, which had for its object the gradual extermination of the leading Sirdars, and the annexation of their lands as State property;' and that “ His Highness the Khan, instead of ruling like a sovereign prince, occupies the position of a robber chieftain on a large scale.' 94. The only case which Major Sandeman adduces in support of these assertions is that of a dispute between the Khan and the Jam of Lus Beyla about a village. Now Major San deman must be aware that this dispute was referred by the Khan to the decision of the British Agent, Captain Harrison; that Captain Harrison studied the case with a full knowledge of of all the facts in reference to which it was disputed and an impartial consideration of all the ai’guments on both sides ; and that, having done this, the British arbiter came to the conclusion that the Khan was, according to Bduch law, the legal and legitimate heir to the disputed village. Yet, without a tittle of fresh evidence, ora single argument to shake the justice of a decision to which the authority of the British Government is committed, Major Sandeman proposes to reverse that decision. 95. A Bntish officer in the service of the British Government is committing, to say the eas , a gross breach of decorum, when he officially accuses his Government, on no better evi- c ence than this, of having deliberately sanctioned and abetted “ a policy of extermination.' • i ^ ie Major Sandeman's assertion, though absurdly exaggerated, has in it a substratum of truth, which he apparently fails to understand. r. The first crude condition of every feudal society is a condition of chronic anarchy, trom winch it has only two modes of escape, each of them more or less violent; conquest J a Tr 01 \ C1 • 1 , power, or the gradual concentration of power, and consequent unification ot authority, in the hands of the Native Prince. The struggle of the Crown, in the latter case, against the Barons is necessarily a sanguinary, but it is also a salutary, one ; and the25 [ xciii ] sooner it is successful the better for the general interests of the State. The ancient rio-hts invariably invoked by the Barons in such a struggle, are rights which retard civilization &amp; permanent maintenance is incompatible with the wholesome growth of settled governmeit and social order; and when these rights h,ve been forfeited by unsuccessful rebellion, it is ce tain y not advisable that they should be arbitrarily restored and enforced by foreign interference. 7 The power of the Crown cannot however, be augmented without diminishing that of its vassals. II.is process ,s an unavoidably violent one ; but to call the policy which favours it a policy ot extermination is an obvious abuse of terms. f u°!! ° f Sandeman teiegraphed that be had received the Khan, and that he had reason to believe tnat his negotiations would end successfully : ^ because the Sirdars in attendance on the Khan expressed the opinion that His Highness would adopt Mamr Sandeman s advice on every point, if he believed Major Sandeman to be supported by the British Government. He added that disturbing rumours of some change of Political Olficers at Jacobabad had weakened his position by throwing doubts “ on my statement as to the future management ot Khelat aftairs. ’ 99. This telegram contained no indication of the nature of the advice which Major Sandeman proposed to give the Khan “ upon every point.” Whatever that advice may be, there can be no doubt that the Khan will accept it, .even if he does not intend to abide by it; for how can he resist advice supported by the presence of 8 UU British troops, the supposed determination of the British Government to enforce it, and the certainty that its rejection will expose him to the immediate opposition of all his most powerful Sirdars, acting with the approval of the British Government? 100. It is surely for this reason very unadvisahle that the authority of the British Government should be committed to arrangements, the details of which are wholly unknown to it. But the omission I have noticed in Major Sandeman’s above-mentioned telegram has not yet been supplied by him. 101. I am also quite unable to conceive what statement Major Sandeman has deemed himself authorized to make to the Khan, or his Sirdars, “as to the future management of Khelat affairs.” The terms of that statement have never been communicated to me; and, if the statement refers, as it appears to refer, to the future personal management of British interests in Khelat, or the eventual administration of the frontier, I must observe that these are questions wholly beyond the competence of Major Sandeman even to discuss; that they are entirely dependent on the ulti mate judgment of the Viceroy, and inseparable from a variety of very important considerations which are neither known to Major Sandeman, nor in any wise subject to his decision. 102. On the 9 th of June Major Sandeman telegraphed that he had had a lengthened interview with the Khan, at which the quarrel between His Highness and his Sirdars had been discussed in all its bearings; that the Khan, on this occasion, had agreed to make peace with the Sirdars, and in so doing to be “ fully guided” by Major San demands advice. Of the nature of that advice no indication is given ; but it is stated that Major Sandeman is “endeavouring to enforce the responsibilities on both sides;” and that on each side two Agents have been named to draw up “ the terms of peace.” The telegram ends with^the usual formula—“ I have every reason to feel satisfied with the progress of my negotiations. 103. On the 16th of June Major Sandeman telegraphs that the Khan has piesented to him written proposals for permanent arrangements between himself and Sirdars to the follow ing effect:— (1.) Pecuniary aid from the British Government to Khan claimed by His Highness, in reference to terms of Jacohabad mediation of 1872, whereby his subjects were to pay value of plundered caravans, whereas, in point of fact, it is he himself who has had to provide t io money for this purpose out of the lakh of rupees given him by the British Government oi a quite different purpose. (2.) The release of the Jam of Lus Beyla, if the British Government do not intend to annex Lus Beyla either to British territory, or to Khelat. (3.) Appeal, in the first instance, to he made by all Sirdars (in case of any cause for complaint on their part) to the Khan himself, and, in the second instance (should they be lissatisfied with the KhaiTs decision), to the British Government, through its Political A a e , resort to arms being suspended pending the reply ol the Political ^ gen (4.) Restoration by the Khan of all lands appropriated by him during past hostilities. (5.) A plan (not described) for securing, on the Khan’s responsibility, the free use o t e Rolan Pass and other trade routes. 104. The telegram adds that the Jhaiawan Sirdars accept the Khan’s proposals, whic lave not yet t&gt;een communicated to the Sarawans.[ xciv ] I presume, however, that, as these proposals restore everything, unconditionally, to the Sirdars, requiring- from them apparently no recognition of any corresponding obligations on their part, the Sarawans will be as well pleased with them as the Jhalawans have been. 105. This is the most important, and, indeed, the only definite information yet received from Major Sandeman. I proceed to examine it. The grounds upon which the Khan now asks for pecuniary assistance sufficiently explain the motive of His Highness, which was not previously intelligible, for stipulating as a preliminary to his interview with Major Sandeman, that the terms 'of the mediation of 1872 should be taken as the basis of any new arrangement. in principle, the Khan’s demand appears to me a very reasonable one. But we are not yet informed what amount of pecuniary assistance he requires. The request for the release of the Khan’s old opponent, the Jam of Lus Beyla, is also explained by the proposals which follow it. The Khan says—“ If you don’t intend to annex Lus Beyla either to British territory, or to Khelat, &amp;c.” Now, as we have never recognized Lus Beyla as independent of Khelat, this sentence is at first sight rather startling. But it must be remembered that of late the situation as regards Lus Beyla has been practically this : The Khan has succeeded in expelling the hereditary lord of that province, whom we have enterne in Sind; but he has not succeeded in establishing his own authority over the province, or securing the acquiescence of its Sirdars in its direct personal administration by himself or his agents. We, however, have held the Khan responsi ble for the orderly government of Lus Beyla; nor, indeed, could we do otherwise, so long as we detain the Jam in British territory as a rebel to the Khan. I take it, therefore, that the Khan means to say to us—“Lus Beyla must be governed by some one—its hereditary local Chief, the Jam; 'its Suzerain Prince, myself; or you, the British Government. It cannot be governed by the Jam, unless you release him; it cannot be governed by you, unless you annex it; and it cannot be governed by me, unless you help me to govern it. On the whole, therefore, you had better release the Jam, but, in so doing, recognize my suzerain rights over him and his Sirdars by the following arrangement.” 106. This arrangement is not very clearly explained by the telegram, which leaves it in some doubt whether it refers exclusively to the present, or, generally and permanently, to the future. If the arbitration of the British Government, as a sort of Court of second instance, between the Khan of Khelat and the Sirdars of Lus Beyla, is to be confined to the present mediation, then I think it is a condition of that mediation which may be safely and conveniently agreed to; for it places the Khan, toe Sirdars, and ourselves in the right relative positions. But the telegram strongly, though not distinctly, implies that it is proposed as an essential part of a general and permanent arrangement, which would commit the British Government to the obli gation of direct intervention in the internal affairs of Khelat on every future occasion of quarrel between the Sirdars and the Khan. If that be so, then I am of opinion that the condition is one which cannot be accepted without careful consideration. 1 am not at all prepared to say that it ought not to be accepted; but I do say that it can only be accepted after the precise terms of it have been submitted to us in a proper form, and duly examined with adequate reference to the principle we are prepared ^o adopt as the basis of our permanent relations with Khelat. 107. The telegram which informs us of this proposal leaves it somewhat doubtful whether it has not already been accepted on behalf of the Supreme Government by Major Sandeman. I have, therefore, thought it necessary to address to him, through Colonel Munro, the telegraphic instruction which will be found amongst the accompanying papers. 108. As regards the Khan’s reported plan for ensuring the future security of the Bolan Pass and other trade routes, the details of it are not yet before us; and, therefore, we cannot yet judge whether they are practical. That is a question probably dependent on the amount of pecuniary assistance to be given to the Khan. But the principle of making the Khan personally responsible for the security of these routes and passes is, in my opinion, an essentially sound one; and, if the acceptation of it by the Khan be due to Major Sandeman’s advice, the intelligent discretion exercised by that officer, in this respect, is all the more to be commended, because the general tenor of his instruction, so far as I can understand it, appears to have left him free to negotiate for the attainment of the object in question by means of direct and separate arrangements with the tribes—a course which I cannot but think injudicious. 109. On the 24th May Major Sandeman forwarded the Khan’s reply to the letter address ed to him by my predecessor. r lhe Khan’s reply to the letter simultaneously addressed to him by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab has not been communicated to me, nor have I been informed whether it has yet been answered. 110 . On the 12th June Colonel Munro telegraphed that Major Sandeman feared that his negotiations would fail, unless he were furnished with a fresh assurance of the confidence, and unconditionally supported by the whole power and authority of the Supreme Government. The same opinion is strongly expressed in a letter received from the Government of the Punjab, under date the 10 th of June, and herewith enclosed.Til. To express unlimited confidence in IVTn’nr &gt; • i myself to the anticipatory approval of advice which wt b,U few unconditional support of arrangements of which I am still very imperfectly info mod was not m my power. I have, however, addressed (under date the 15th I„L message to Major Saudeman through Colonel Munro, the text of which is mneLd eS ‘ ap,,1 ° Chief causes of our present difficulties. U fh ''S' Sind poliq-” is, I think, perfectly ^d b prindpfe, mi yet, in practice, it has failed. v\ by ? Because the principle has never been fairly followed out to its Wical con clusion ; only halt acted on at all times, and some times ill acted on : it has been like a political prescription rightly written, but wrongly taken. The ingredients, though correctly indicated have not been mixed m their proper proportions. ’ 114. I can conceive no form of government, in a neighbouring State, more calculated to embarrass our relations with that State, than a recognized and artificially prolonged feudal confederation. ^ Such a confederation is destitute of any administrative authority, or sovereign representa tive, with which a foreign State can hold satisfactory and reliable relations. &amp; We cannot practically, base our permanent footing in Khelat on separate and fluctuating understandings' with half a dozen conflicting authorities in a chronic condition of mutual antagonism. We cannot reckon upon the shifting support of one or more such minor powers in a State to ensure things going right. Yet, if things go wrong, we are equally powerless to make one of them answerable for all of them. 115. Major Sandeman, correctly I think, describes the position to which we have reduced the Khan of Khelat, or into which we have suffered him to fall, as that of “a robber Chief on a large scale/'’ But it is not to our interest and advantage to perpetuate, on one of our most important frontiers, the existence of a robber Chief on a large scale. 116. On the other hand, Major Sandeman seems to forget that, even under the barbarous Baronial constitution of Khelat, the Khan has certain sovereign rights, which it is greatly to our interest and advantage that he should he able to exercise with adequate effect, in fulfilment of those obligations which none but a sovereign authority can contract with a foreign State. 117. If, however, it was wise to support, and promote, the Khan’s sovereign authority, it was clearly unwise to support it inadequately, and promote it only by fits and starts. The inherent weakness of the Khan’s power, once recognized as a source of embarrassment to ourselves, claimed, from the due consideration of our own interests, an ampler contribution to his strength. The pecuniary assistance, received from us by His Highness, has never been quite sufficient, and, of late, it has been altogether insufficient to enable him to exercise effectively, or maintain uninterruptedly, the authority on behalf of which that assistance was accorded to him. But, as before observed, we cannot assist the Khan at'all, without thereby incurring some responsibility on his account; and the only reason for assisting him is that such assistance gives us the right, as well as the power, to control his conduct. Whilst, therefore, on the one hand (inasmuch as none but Sovereign Powers can hold international relations with each other) I think it injudicious to allow the Sirdars to treat with us independently of the Khan ; yet, on the other hand, I don t think we. can safely or justly ignore the fact that the Sirdars are a very real power in Khelat, of which the Khan himself is not practically altogether independent. Our support to him should be a guarantee for justice to them ; and, although I cannot too strongly deprecate, on our part,, public opposi tion to the Khan, in the cause of his rebellious vassals, yet I think our authority must, at all times, be forcibly, though privately, exerted, not against, but upon him, foi the pievention of rebellion by the timely redress of legitimate grievances; and he must not he allowed to reject our advice so long as he receives our money. 118. The weakness of our influence over the Khan is a not unnatural consequence of the inadequacy of our pecuniary support to him. Sometimes our relations with Khelat have &gt;een, practically, in the hands of men of exceptional ability. Then the personal influence of our Agent, and the soundness of his judgment on critical occasions have temporarily corrected and concealed this fundamental defect in the whole position At other times our relations with Khelat have fallen into the hands of inferior men, and then the natural, and uncollected consequences of this defect have become inconveniently apparent. To remove the defect itself, must be the first step towards any permanent amelioration of our relations with, and position in, Khelat. 119. The commencement of all that is now most embarrassing thos ® j most false in that position, I date from the Jacobabad mediation ot 1872, when, n steadcorrecting the course, we impatiently threw overboard the compass of our policy. Since then we have drifted before every wind of chance, and have never been clear of the rocks. 120. Now, I think it not only unnecessary, but seriously inexpedient, to import into the practical consideration of any of the questiohs involved in the resettlement of our relations with Khelat, the unhappy controversy still going on between our Sind and Punjab officials as to the relative merits, or demerits, of the frontier policies with which they are respectively identified. The state of things on the frontier of the Punjab is materially different from the state of things on the frontier of Sind. That being the case, each Government has naturally devised a policy specially adapted to the management of its own interests, and exclusively directed to the removal of its own difficulties. Things, good in their proper place, become bad when out of their place. Each of these two systems has much to recommend the adoption of it within the limits of its original application : neither of them can be advantageously applied beyond those limits. For this reason, both the observations recorded by Sir B. Frere in his interesting , memorandum on the Sind and Punjab policies * I believe that several of my colleagues have , , *1 ^ 1 ’ written notes on tl.is meiuoniiidum, *but the onl, one and any remarks made on those observations I have yet seen is Mr. Bayley’s. by my hon ble colleagues^ are beside the question ( Sd.'j L. V»n-*r/v ir\r\rxr 'frv oirldr* 121. But, whilst deploring the partizanship of our local officials, I am very sensible of the seriousnesss'of the contrary error, to which those are liable who, reviewing at a distance the events of Khelat politics, purely by the aid of official documents, and entirely in the spirit of official impartiality, may be unconsciously predisposed to take a judicial, rather than a political, view of the practical questions which such events oblige us to consider. 122. These are questions, not of equity, but of expediency. Whatever be the abstract pros and cons or the technical rights and wrongs, according to Biluch law, tradition, or custom, of the matters in dispute between the Khan and his vassals, we need certainly not give ourselves the trouble to examine them, if they did not materially affect our interests, or interfere with our convenience as a great power. It is, therefore, those interests and that convenience which we have primarily and specially to regard in dealing with such questions. Now, I venture to think that we, the Government of' India, are in nowise concerned with the investigation of ancient Biluch law, nor yet with the cause of either Khan or Sirdar except in so far as they directly affect British interests. Our connection with the affairs of Khelat is a purely political one. The interests of Khelat itself are fortunately not antagonis tic, but they are necessarily secondary to our own; and, whether we support either the Khau or the Sirdars, we shall do it from motives of expediency, not of sentiment; for it is not the justice of either cause, but the British interests involved in it, which can alone constitute any claim to our support. From this point of view, I can scarcely conceive a policy more pre judicial to British interests (which, as regards our frontier States, I sincerely believe to be identical with the progressive interests of civilization) than the policy of favoring and promoting a reversion to any ancient Baronial privileges, which may have been fairly forfeited by Bai’onial rebellion, in the barbarous feudal constitution of Khelat. 123. The feudal system of Nussir Khan, to which Mr. Bayley incidentally refers in a recent note by him, containing an admirably clear resume of Khelat history, appears to me infinitely worse than the earliest Norman constitution of England. But if, at some period (say one of the later Plantaganet reigns) of that long and sanguinary struggle for supremacy between the Barons and the Crown of England, some overwhelmingly superior foreign power had stepped in between the combatants, and insisted on a reversion to the constitutional system of William the Conqueror, how infelicitous to England would have been the consequences of such a policy on the part of the intervening power! 124. Now, up to the year 1872, it is on record that, in spite of the unreliable character of the Khan himself, and the inadequacy of the support given by us to his authority, notwith standing the turbulence of his vassals, and the frequency of their revolts, he was able to maintain, with our assistance, a certain continuity of administrative power, and to fulfil his Treaty obligations in a manner which, if not altogether satisfactory, at least relieved us from the necessity of active interference in the affairs of the Khan. It is, moreover, to be observed that, throughout the history of his reign, precisely the same names recur at the head of every revolt; some of the rebels, like Azad Khan, not having even the pretence to a grievance, personal or public, but aiming avowedly at the usurpation of the throne. 125. In 1869 Captain Harrison prepared a list of fifty-one Chiefs who were then generally well-disposed towards the Khan, as compared with some twelve, or more, opposed to him; and, although it is true that the smaller number included the principal Sirdars, yet this very fact affords strong evidence that it was not so much oppression and misrule as a struggle for personal power to which the disturbances of Khelat were attributable. 126. But 1871 introduced a change in our old position, and in that of the Khan. The Mithankote Conference developed, and the Jacobabad mediation completed, the prejudicial effects ot it. Those who had formerly been treated as rebels to their lawful ruler, suing forthe g-ood offices of the British Government, were then recognized as legitimate bellio'erents claiming the arbitration of a friendly power ,n a just cause. By that arbitration they we,e replaced in possession of all their previous advantages, whilst the Khan was forced to Em inence an arduous struggle with diminished authority and weakened strength. 127. When Major Sandeman appeared upon the scene, the political position in Khelat was that of a drawn battle The Khan had succeeded in driving almost every one of Ms principal opponents into exile ; but Ins power, unsupported by us, was insufficient to maintain its authonty over their deserted districts. On the other hand, the Sirdars were equally power- less to recover their lost advantages, or to expel the Khan. J ^ 128. What is now to he feared is, that Major Sandeman, holding the views which lie has so frequently and strongly proclaimed, may promise, on behalf of the British Government to reinstate the disaffected birdars m all their original rights and possessions. This seems to be the meaning of the ‘settlement of Nussir Khan” to which he alludes. The Khan who according to Major Sandeman's recent telegram, “ seems disposed to take his advice'on all points,” must, of course, in his present situation, accept any terms which Major Sandemau may, with our permission, impose upon him. 129. But, if those terms be unduly onerous to the Khan, it will be difficult for us to en force his permanent submission to them by any material guarantee short of the prolonged maintenance of British troops in Khelat territory, or subsequent armed intervention. 130. This Prince has not been fortunate in his career. His authority has been weakened to a great extent by his own misconduct; his treasury impoverished by unsuccessful wars with his nobles; his faith in the British Goveanment rudely shaken by the inharmonious action and conflicting polices of our local officials. 131. I agree with Mr. Bayley in the opinion he has expressed, in accordance with that of Sir W. Merewether and others, that the Khan can only keep his throne by our support: and, were it to our interest that he should lose his throne, I think that our simplest and most dignified policy would have been one of complete abstention from any kind of interference in his affairs. He would probably, in that case, have been deposed ere now by his own Sirdars. In deed, this is just what was about to happen when w'e again, for the third time, intervened between him and them. But it is not to our interest that the Khan should lose his throne; and I cannot quite agree with Mr. Bayley in attributing all our present troubles to the support he has received from us.* On the contrary, I attribute them chiefly to the inadequacy and vacillation of that support. 132. The practical questions suggested by the preceding review of our past and present ■elations with Khelat may now be plainly answered. # I am not at all sure, however, that Mr. Bayley does mean this. I rather think that the opinion, more implied than expressed in ins above-mentioned note, is that our support of the Khan lias been frequently unaccompanied by any adequately corre sponding control over his conduct; and, if so, I share that opinion. (Sd.) L. W/mt is to be done ? 133. The first thing it now behoves us to do is, I think, to recognize distinctly the reali ties, as apart from the technicalities, and official traditions, of the situation we ‘have to deal with; the second thing is to distinguish clearly the character and extent of British interests affected by that situation ; the third will be the adoption of a policy exclusively directed to the security and development of those interests; and the fourth, a consistent prosecution of the policy thus adopted. 134. Now as regards the realities of our position in Khelat, and the character and scope of the British interests concerned in it, I cannot too emphatically repeat, what I have had occasion to affirm elsewhere,—that it is not in my power to recognize the present existence of any such thing as an Afghan question, or a Khelat question. The time has irrevocably passed away when such questions could be reasonably regarded and treated as local ones. 1 hey have become, from every practical point of view, mere subordinate parts and portions of one momen tous and anxious political problem, created by the struggle with which we aie thteatenec between ourselves and Russia,—on this side for the maintenance, on that foi the acquisition, o imperial power and influence in the East. 135. This great Russian question grows visibly, and with an almost supernatural rapidity, like the rod of Aaron, by the absorption of all others with which it comes in contact 136. The interests involved on our part are not local, but imperial, not merely Indian, but, in the widest sense of the word, British. Were the only dangers to which we are exposed upon our Indian frontier still confined to the churlishness or turbulence ot a tew halt savage Chiefs or tribes, we could, as heretofore, afford to turn our hacks or shut our eyes, on ail that passes in Afghanistan or Biluchistan. But the Ameer of Cabul and the Khan of Khelat are now become mere counters (valueless themselves, jut oa e wi ue vie i worth of costly stakes) in the difficult game for empire we are playing, or may have to play, with a great, an ambitious, and a not over-scrupulous, first-class European power.[ xcviii ] 137. My colleagues may possibly be interested to learn that a few weeks ago Malcolm Khan, the Persian Envoy in London, commenting on our present proceedings in Khelat, informed Lord Derby that he was instructed to remind the British Government that Persia has claims upon that Khanate, which are incompatible either with the annexation of it by us, or anv interference on our part in its internal affairs. To this communication the British Government has replied that we have no intention of annexing Khelat, but that we have, by Treaty, rights of interference in the internal affairs of that Khanate, which we intend to exercise in any way and to any extent deemed necessary by us for the protection of British interests. 138. Now, it must be admitted that the conclusion of the Persian Government is not altogether illogical, if it assumes that the policy, whereby we have apparently, with the best intentions, rather hastened the disintegration of administrative unity and sovereign authority in Khelat, ’ has been pursued as a deliberate preliminary to the anexation of the Khanate. But this 'renewal of Persia’s claims on Khelat, which the settlement of the boundary in 1871 was deliberately intended to set at rest for ever, has, in my eyes, a sinister significance. Persia has, of course, a direct interest in the settlement of the Kohuk question. This question I have purposely hung up for the present, in accordance with the principle to which I am anxious to conform the whole of my foreign policy. I consider that, in our present very critical situation, nothing can be more mischievous than to treat such questions as if they stood alone, or to decide them, from a judicial point of view, upon their own merits. Every move ive now make in frontier affairs must be carefully considered beforehand in its proper connection with the general principles of the game we are playing. For the geographical and historical grounds on which the Kohuk question might be decided by a perfectly disinterested tribunal, I care absolutely nothing; and, until I have clearly ascertained what decision of that question will be most conducive to the security of British interests, 1 refrain from deciding it. But this cannot be ascertained until the present character of our relations both with Khelat and Afghanistan has assumed a more definite form. The impatience of the Persian Government, however, in regard to the decision of the Kohuk question, has been manifested on every possible occasion previous to the above-mentioned communication, and in this com munication no reference is made to Kohuk. I am, therefore, of opinion that the language of Malcolm Khan is not sufficiently explained by reference to Persian interests with regard to Kohuk. There is reason to believe that Malcolm Khan is not absolutely incorruptible; he is known to have accepted a large bribe in the “ Reuter concession” question, and he may not probably differ from the rest of his colleagues in not being impervious to the influence of Russian coin. 139. Russia has now at Teheran a Minister of restless energy, and apparently of consi derable ability. The influence of the British Government at Teheran has, of late years, and for obvious reasons, rapidly declined. That of the Russian Government has proportionately increased. The Russian Minister at Teheran, if he be at all in the confidence of his Government, is probably conversant with the course oi the efforts made by General Kauffman to checkmate our influence in Afghanistan, and he may reasonably be presumed to have apprehended a fact which seems to have hitherto escaped the notice of my colleagues, that our hold over Khelat must become a matter of vital importance to us, in proportion as our influence at Cabul declines. There is, therefore, reason to suspect that the communication made to the British Government by Malcolm Khan, on behalf of his own Government, may have been inspired by Russian statesmanship; and that it represents the first movement of a pawn on the chessboard, by the hand of our great and astute adversary. 140. Be that as it may, having regard to possible contingencies in Turkistan and Northern Persia, our frontier relations in Khelat must now be conducted towards the attain ment of objects of infinitely higher importance than the mere prevention of plunder within British borders, or the safe transit of trade. We cannot, consistently with our own interest, allow the Khanate to remain in its present distracted condition; the measures, hitherto adopted by us, are not calculated to secure a permanent amelioration of that condition ; they have increased, instead of lessening, the difficulties of the Khan. The direct payment of a subsidy to the marauding tribes, mainly responsible for the late disturbances on our border, may, for the moment, secure peace in British territory, but is in no way conducive to the permanent tran quillity of Khelat. To subsidise habitual marauders, in order to relieve British territory from their incursions, and, at the same time, to deprive the Khan of the only means ever possessed by him (insufficient though they were) of preserving his own country from the raids of those marauders, to give to the marauders large sums of money from the north, leaving them free to devastate the south, is a policy which appears to me fraught with disastrous consequences. 141. Having laid down these general principles, I now come to the consideration of the steps to be immediately taken in accordance with them. Before deciding anything, we must await the receipt of Major Sandemau’s promised report. Should that report convince me that he has, in any wise, pledged the Supreme Government to a degree of support, which I am not prepared to accord to the Sirdars o Khelat in their quarrel with the Khan, I shall reluctantly deem it my duty to place the[ xcix ] arbitration in other hands. But the frequency with which of late we have chanced our instruments and slut ed our policy m the manacement of our relations with Khelat Sears to me so objectionable, that I shall be extremely unwilling to take such a steo and Ttbe report which I am now awaiting should afford any reasonable prospect of the' mediation commenced by Major Sandeman, being earned out on equitable tenns advantaceous to British interests {as 1 understand them), it will be, by all means, desirable that lie shoufd finish it. l 4 'f', 1 • re f e J Ve f0r r'uf' 01 ' &lt; ; on * K,era tion the question of deputing a fresh Agent at some latei pcnod 01 consolidating the basis of our permanent relations with the Khan, and for fimuslnng me with confidential reports as to certain military aspects of our future position m Khelat, in regard, to which 1 am anxious for the opinion of a more competent strategist than Major bandemau. r 55 143. I am under a strong impression that it is by means of the position still open to us to assume m Khelat, that we may politically turn the flank of the Ameer of Cabul and materially diminish the importance of his uncertain co-operation. I think that, sooner or later, a thorough exploration of Western Biluchistan may be advantageously undertaken, with a view to ascertaining the practicability of the ground between Seistan and Herat and whether there be a wheel or water track between Seistan and Gwadur or Bunder Abbas. ' 144. The Russian militaiy Lne from the Caspian to the borders of Kashgar is weak, and maintained ^ with much difficulty, Russia does not send there her best soldiers, but chiefly her convicts, or disgraced men. The financial loss of it is enormous, and severely felt by her. On the otbei hand, the Caucasus, according to all accounts, is one of the finest bases of operation in the world. The Caspian places it in easy communication on one side, the Black Sea on the other, with tne arsenals of Russia. Here, too, the resistance to Russian domination is not so much national as religious ; here Russia holds a fine and well-equipped army, under the popular command of one of her most energetic Princes, in an impregnable position, and surrounded by a more or less friendly population. The ridge, though high, is no impediment to co-operation from either side. I have been informed, on high authority, that it is better than that of the Stelvio. 145. For all these reasons, a forward movement by the army of the Caucasus is, perhaps, more to be apprehended than a similar movement by the army of Turkistan. Before the latter, lie only deserts, or countries like Yarkand, who may be formidable opponents; before the former, the two richest provinces of Persia. Bearing in mind all these considerations, with special reference to the deplorable effects of our present diplomatic system, it maj^ hereafter be worth while to weigh the advantages of a good Intelligence Agency close upon the Persian frontier. 146. But to return to the question more immediately before ns, namely, the arbitration of the present difference between the Khan and the Sirdars. As before observed, I reserve the formation of a final judgment until after the receipt of Major Sandemaw’s report; but I am strongly disposed to insist on certain territorial cessions by the Chiefs in acknowledgment of their misconduct in resorting to open rebellion against their Suzerain Prince. I think that some such arrangement may be necessary to maintain the principle I have in view, and to which I attach the greatest importance, although I should be prepared to recoup them for any excessive loss in consequence of such an arrangement by means of money allowances to be paid to them through, and by, the Khan himself. This would increase the power of the Khan both ways. * This subsidy must be regarded as the purchase money paid for our virtual possession of Khelat, with all the advantages, and none of the disadvan tages, of annexation. A very much larger sum than the Khan has ever yet received from us may be most advantageously invested in such a purchase. (Sd). L. 147. And now, as regards our future relations with Khelat. We must renew the Treaty of 1854, which has been seriously invalidated by our recent proceedings; but I would renew it upon an enlarged basis, considerably increasing our subsidy to the Khan.* This, and all similar subsidies, ought not to be entered in our Annual Budget for the information of foreign powers. But 'that is a matter to be settled hereafter between myself and the Financial Department. The con ditions for the adequate protection of the Bolan Pass, and other trade routes, must be dependent on the character of the Khan s pioposals, which have not yet been communicated to us; but I consider it essential to our inteiesus tiat we should be able to bold some one person or authority responsible to us for the fulfilment ol any such conditions, and whatever subsidies to tribes or Chiefs may be necessary to ensure t is object, should be paid to them through, and by, the Khan himself with our assistance. 148. As regards military precautions, so far from protesting against the maintenance of a mercenary force in support of the Khan’s authority, I would encomage an ceve ope i in sue a manner as to make it practically the advanced guard of our own power m Khelat, In accordance with this policy I think that the British escort,, assigned to Major Sandeman, must, on any pretext, be maintained iu Khelat for some little time to come, an oca ec a&amp; nea: the Bolan Pass as possible. 149. With the Khan’s sanction, and under the terms of the rcuiewed treaty, ! won establish a British military post at, or near, Dadur. I am well aware that this locality is saidto be unhealthy in the hot season ; but that fact only affords an excellent pretext for patrolling our troops northwards up the Bolan Pass during the summer months; and I observe that Sir H. Green, who is well acquainted with the locality, has laid great stress upon maintaining there a British military post. 150 Should the Khan desire it, I would place at his disposal British officers for the military training of his little force, and even allow him to recruit it from British territory. 151. I would establish, on a permanent footing, an intelligent British Agent at Khelat, with an Assistant Agent at Quetta. This latter officer would be the sentry of British interests, and mi°’ht eventually become the head of an important Intelligence Department. I would also encourage the British colonization of Quetta. I am inclined to think that the establishment of a Bntish hospital there might be a means of increasing our social and political influence over the surrounding neighbourhood. Shawlkot, or Quetta, is a. point in Khelat territory, the importance of^which to British interests must no longer be neglected. Here every circum stance is in favor of our influence. The Shawlkotis, or people of Quetta, still speak with affection of Captain Bean, and of the good he did amongst them. Captain Wylie, in his topographical report, has expressed his conviction that the reception of a British officer at Quetta would be thoroughly cordial; and we have before us a great consensus of authorita tive testimony as to the friendliness of the people towards our Government, and its officers. But this is not all. The Candaharis, with whom a British officer stationed at Quetta would be in immediate personal contact, are the only portion of the Afghan population who are not, and never were, haters of the Feringhee. Less bigoted than the Cabulese, they regard us with no inveterate national dislike, and it is, therefore, from this part of Afghanistan that our influence in that Frontier State may be most favorably worked. 152. In connection with this consideration, I may perhaps, mention that it was my original intention to send a confidential mission first of all to Khelat, and thence, after the satisfactory settlement of our relations with the Khan, to Cabul via Candabar. It was only at Bombay that I received from Lord Northbrook news of Major SandemaiFs mission to Khelat. Major Sandeman’s instructions appeared to me so vague, and the whole character of his mission so at variance with the principle to which I have already adverted, and which I desire to adopt as the basis of my own foreign policy, viz., that of treating all frontier questions as parts of a whole question, and not as separate questions having no relation to each other, that I tele graphed and wrote to Lord Northbrook on my way to Calcutta, urging him to suspend the mission of Major Sandeman, who had not then entered Khelat territory, until my assumption of office, which took place a few days later, in order that I might have the opportunity of re considering and, if necessary, revising, Major Sandemaids instructions in connection with the views and plans I had already formed with regard to our whole frontier policy, and associating his mission, if possible, more directly with the attainment of the object I had in view. As this suggestion, however, was not accepted by my predecessor, to whom, indeed, I had not time to explain fully all the grounds on which it had been urged, I was obliged to recast the arrange ments I had contemplated in a form less favorable to their success. 153. I cannot doubt that an intelligent British Agent, established at Quetta, might not only develope the traffic from Candahar to India, facilitating its transmission by the Bolan or Thull-Chotiali routes, but also greatly extend our political influence in Candahar itself. 154. Although we have a treaty right to do so, I would not occupy Quetta. Our occu pation of it would not protect Kutchee, and might, in many other respects, be embarrassing. This point, being at the far end of the Pass, could not be held by us in a military way without a strong garrison and a chain of military posts to maintain communications; whereas Dadur can be occupied without any such precautions, or any increase of the force we now maintain in Sind. 155. I would insist upon the Khan^s maintaining order in Kutchee, but, at the same time, if necessary, supply him with the means of so doing. 156. M ith regard to the Murris, if the Khan evinces an inveterate repugnance to have anything to do with this troublesome tribe, I would not insist upon making him responsible for their good behaviour; and, in that case, we must continue to deal with them directly. But I think it would be infinitely preferable to give the Khan the means of bribing, or coercing them, and hold him responsible for the result. ^ 157. I am not sanguine as to the result of any direct engagement between the British Government and these irreclaimable plunderers. Major Sandeman^s success in securing their abstention from raids on the Punjab side of our frontier prove nothing, for they compensated themselves by plundering all the more in Kutchee, and their own Chiefs tell us that they are too poor to live by any other means. The Khan, unaided by us, is not strong enough to coerce them; and, unless we furnish him with the means of coercing them, to make him re sponsible foi their conduct, will only lead to further complications. The temporarily complete suppression of these troublesome marauders, however, on the occasion when the Khan’s expedi tion against them was accompanied by Major Green, is, I think, encouraging to a favorable viev, of what may be done ny the Khan, if His Highness be efficiently supported by us.158. The four objects we must henceforth bear in mind arp—m a commanding* influence in Khelat; ( 2 ) the support of a stron«- and «Jfl A™ maintenanc e of a ( 3 ) the freedom and security of the Bolan Pass and nth p! d f ttle ^ ^^^ent there; Kutchee (through which district trade reaches India) and the dov^ 8 ’ t the P acification of sible, of its great natural wealth. and the d ^o V ment, as rajndly as pos- 159.

As regards the mechanism necessary for carrying out the policy thus indicated, this is a subordinate question, which need not, at present, be considered in detail Such mechanism must necessarily he incomplete, until the administration of our whole frontier at least so far as regards the trans-Indus portion of it, has been placed under the direct control of the Viceroy acting through a single responsible authority, who must be entirely independent of the local Governments on every part of the frontier. It is at present premature to discuss the details of the administrative re-organization necessary for this purpose.APPENDIX XI. [ Referred to in paragraph 11, Chapter III.'] MINUTE BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY, DATED 22ND SEPTEMBER 1876. KEEL AT. The document purporting to be Major Sandeman's long promised final and complete report has at last come to hand; but it is certainly not complete, and I fear it is not final. a. In the first place, the appendices belonging to this report have not yet been received. In the second place, the Khelat Diary of July 81st, which has reached us subsequent to the receipt of the report, shows Major Sandeman to be still engaged in acting as arbiter between the Khan and his Sirdars, and settling their disputes on principles which have not been submit- 1 fop approval to the Government of India. In the thud place, this diaiy is accompanied by a document of the very greatest importance, which must materially affect the character of any instructions to IVfajor Sandeman founded on the report itself, and which ought certainly to have been annexed to the report for the timely information of the Government. 8 . Wilh regard to the still missing appendices (for which I have twice telegraphed in vain), it will be observed that they refer to the details of thirty-six grievances alleged by the Sirdars against the Khan, and finally disposed of by His Highness, with the concurrence of the British mediator, to the general satisfaction of all concerned. As, therefore, these papers have reference only to certain purely domestic arrangements between the Khan and his vassals, which have now becomeaccomplished facts/'’ and on which the Government of India would, in no circumstances, be called upon to take any action, I consider that, although Major Sandemaffs omission to send with his report the supplementary papers properly belonging to it, is an irregularity to be regretted, it need in no wise prevent us from coming at once to a deci sion on those points which, as set forth in the report itself, now press for ratification or rejection. 4. Promptitude in the decision of these points is, I think, rendered specially desirable by the information contained in the second of the above-mentioned documents (the Khelat Diary of July 31st), which shows that Major Sandeman has not deemed it incumbent on him to suspend the activity of his personal interference in the affairs of the Khelat State, pending the receipt of instructions for his guidance in reference to the facts submitted by his report to the consideration of the Government. 5 . Before passing to the consideration of Major Sandeman’s report, however, I must call the serious attention of my colleagues to the document inclosed in his letter of the 14th of August to Colonel Munro. Major Sandemam’s report is dated the 31st of July, and the document in question, the 1st of August. It was, therefore, promulgated by the Khan on the very day after Major Sandeman had completed the report purporting to furnish the Govern ment of India with the complete information required by it, as to the whole course of his proceedings in Khelat, and the practical result of them. It is greatly to be regretted on all accounts that this important document should not have come to the knowledge of the Govern ment of India until some weeks subsequent to our receipt of Major Sandemards report; and that, without awaiting the sanction, or even the cognizance of it by the Governor-General in Council, Major Sandeman should have caused it to be promulgated and carried into practical effect; for it commits the British Government to a minute and permanent interference in the most domestic affairs of Khelat, which we can neither undertake, nor decline, without embar rassment ; but any further reference to this particular document will be more conveniently preceded by the observations I now desire to submit to the early consideration of my col leagues on the subject of Major Sandemaids report. As this report is put up with the present note for their perusal, I need only express my own conclusions in reference to those portions of it which concern the following questions :— Arrangements for the security of the Rolan Pass. 6 . I consider that the arrangements recommended by Major Sandeman are generally satisfactory, and should be approved. Some of their details, however, require further explan ation ; and the Khan’s direct personal responsibility to us for the security of the pass must be positively insisted on, and acknowledged ; the proposed payment of Rupees 1,800 to Pass guards being made through the Khan, and included in the general subsidy granted to His Highness. Subsidy to the Khan. 1. I also approve of Major Sandeman’s recommendation on this point; and I propose that the Khan’s subsidy be renewed and increased to Rupees 1,00,000 from the date of thesigning of a supplementary treaty, to which I will refer hereafter 411 f t tribes, or subordinate Chiefs, must, however, be included in this subsidy^ I ,a l' ments to Release of the Jam of las Beyla. 8 . I approve of the release of this Sirdar on the following conditions tho/t tliG Jam shall malm Ins absolnfp eiiVimioom,-. i ,i Khan; and, Zndly, that he shall publicly withdraw and re V ^ S ^ Ze 1 r ^ m ailtll0rit y of the exemptions, not already accorded 'to the^h^ or pears to have fully accepted, on his own behalf the uositinn d fi i i tn A 1 a P‘ :i ' v 11 li, v ft,,,., .ifpp'.lfi.bPi.pt tbrf ip sjsrr* •* distinctly rejected by us, and as distinctly withdrawn by the Jam before’hi! l-'l' ' ,rJll,10Q ’ sanctioned without risk of its leading to future troubles^nd compilations 0311 ^ Quarrel between the brothers Saheb Khan and Jaim Mahomed (Chota Chiefs). 9 . I propose that Saheb Khan be required to elect between resigning the Chieftainshin and res,gnmgh.s present appointment m our own police, he being otherwise rewaded if necessary. It is obvious that the two positions are incompatible, and that their simultaneous oeeupation by Saheb Khan, has been, and must, so long as it lasts, continue to be a faithful source or misunderstanding and embarrassment. Release of cevtain Jamootee ptisoners. 10. This point calls for no remark. The Khan’s claims to reimbursement for payments made on account of plundered caravans. 11. These claims are essentially just and reasonable; but, as the decision of the British Government, out of which they have arisen, was not, in my opinion either tne one or the other, I think it will be politic to avoid a formal recognition of the grounds on which they are based. I would, therefore, satisfy them, indirectly” and without entering into details, by a spontaneous and liberal gift to His Highness. I propose that, for this purpose, a lump sum he presented to the Khan, as a mark of friendship and generosity on the part of the British Government, independent of his augmented subsidy. I think that 'the amount of such a sum should be determined in no niggard spirit, and should appreciably exceed the amount of the Khan's actual loss, in consequence of our former decisions. I would therefore, fix the minimum of the proposed gift at three lakhs of rupees; but, with the con sent of my colleagues, I would rather make it larger; as I am persuaded that it will be good policy to leave the Khan no just reason to regret the concessions made by His Highness to his disloyal vassals at the instigation of our own Agent, or to regard the virtual curtailment of his personal independence, under the present re-settlement of his relations with the British Government, as inadequately compensated by the practical benefits thereby conferred upon him. The terms of this re-settlement, when published, are likely to attract the attention of the Khan's neighbours; and, in considering what should be the character of them, we must look to their probable effect, not only in Khelat, but also in other frontier States, whose Bulers mis trust our friendship as prejudicial to their independence. It must, however, be distinctly understood that all past claims on the part of His Highness are wiped out by the proposed donation. Claims of certain Kandahar Merchants, 8fc. 12 . These are very trifling and may be similarly disposed of. Tasting of Captain Wylie in the Rolan Pass, for the superintendence of the arrangements connected with its security. 13. I am prepared to approve of this proposal, hut only as a temporary measure. 14. The foregoing questions are the only ones on which Major Sandeman directly solicits the decision of his Government; and they are comparatively simple. But his report raises other questions of wider significance, which demand most careful consideration. The first of these, and the most important, is, what shall henceforth be the character and extent of interference by the British Government in the internal affairs of the State of Khelat ? 15. The terms of peace, now arranged between the Khan and his Sirdars, bear the signature of Major Sandeman, as a witness, and, therefore, it may be presumed, as a consent ing and approving party to the arrangement. This arrangement distinctly piovides that neither the Khan, nor the Sirdars, shall wage war against each other, until the subject of dis pute between them has been referred to the British Government for decision, in all cases when the complainants are the Sirdars.16. Now, it is clear that the British Government cannot openly become a party to this arrangement, without thereby accepting the office of judj.e and executioner in all cases of serious dispute between the vassals and the Prince of a neighbouring and, nominally, independent State. Such a degree of permanent interference in the internal affairs of that State, involves an important departure from the policy hitherto pursued by the British Government in the conduct of its relations with Rhelat. The position, there fore, in which the Government will be placed by its sanction of the arrangement between the Khan and his Sirdars, now concluded by Major Sandeman on its behalf, involves responsibilities which should not be rashly undertaken. At the same time there can be no doubt that it offers advantages which must not be lightly rejected. The opinion expressed by Major Sandeman on this point may be taken as a deliberate outcome of the investigations he was instructed to make into the present social and political condition of Khelat, and his personal knowledge of the feelings and dispositions of those on whose conduct our future relations with this important frontier State must, in any case, depend. I would, therefore, solicit special attention to the ipnssima verba of the Agent, whom, with almost unprecedented demonstrations of confidence in his judgment, the Government of India deputed to Khelat in the spring of this year, for the purpose of there collecting information and forming opinions for the guidance of its frontier policy. Major Sandeman, speaking of the present state of affairs in Khelat, says—“ The direct interference of the British Government, acting as a paramount power, is absolutely necessary, and must be maintained.” And again —“ To make its interference really effective for the future, the British Government must state to both sides that it accepts the responsibility they desire to enforce on it, and will aid them materially, as the paramount power, to preserve the peace of the country.” 17. It must, no doubt, be acknowledged that the Government of India has cause to receive, with some disappointment, such decisive and imperative advice from the officer, on whose special personal influence it so confidently relied for escape from those very responsibilities which Major Sandeman now invites it to assume; and which, I must say, he has done his best to impose upon it. After five months' exercise by Major Sandeman of his personal influence, unrestricted by the most accommodating instructions, and supported by the presence of 800 British troops, the practical result is his plain declaration that the peace of Khelat cannot be preserved unless the Government accepts the unwonted responsibilities, from which it was the object of his mission to rescue it, and invests him with a larger portion of its own authority than has ever been entrusted to his predecessors. 18. Nevertheless, whatever may be the risks of the position, in ■which the British Gov ernment is now placed by the practical result of Major Sandeman's mission, they are, in my deliberate judgment, overwhelmingly outnumbered by those which would be involved in any attempt to recede from it. From the moment when Major Sandeman's mission was decided on, any return to the policy of non-intervention became practically impossible. Its epitaph was solemnly recorded in the Resolution which authorized this officer to proceed to Khelat as a dens ex machina of the British Government, with almost unlimited freedom of personal action, and the support of a strong military escort. I conceive, therefore, that the Government has now no alternative to a frank and fearless adoption of every reasonable responsibility incurred by the steps it has already taken, and inseparable from what I think we all feel to be the para mount necessity of promptly securing a strong and permanent hold over Khelat. 19. If, as asserted by Major Sandeman, both the Khan and the Sirdars of that State, desire to force upon us a considerable responsibility, for the preservation of peace between them; and if, as the terms of the agreement negotiated by Major Sandeman sufficiently attest, that desire is so vehement, on both sides, that they are willing to recognize the British Government as the paramount master of their destinies, and invest it with extra ordinary powers of interference in the internal affairs of their State; then the effect of our refusal to accept such a position, or undertake such responsibilities, must be seriously considered in its relation to the permanent peace of Khelat, and the sentiments with which we are now, and should afterwards be, regarded by the parties concerned. I cannot, indeed, consider as altogether chimerical the danger of inducing Khelat to seek the protection of some other neighbouring Power—Persia or Afghanistan—if we now disappoint the expecta tions Major Sandeman has encouraged, or altogether reject the responsibilities to which he has substantially committed us. My only object, therefore, is to keep those respon sibilities within reasonable limits; to discriminate between such as are clearly accompanied by appreciable advantages to the interests of the British Government, and others, which, without any adequate benefit to those interests, would involve permanent and petty interference in matters which do not concern us. 20. The second question has reference to the location of troops in the Khan's territory. By the Treaty of 1854 we have already authority to quarter troops in any part of that territory; but we have only once availed ourselves of such authority, the exercise of which is consequently liable to all the inconvenience of an authority long dormant, and, for that reason, provocative of dispute whenever it is asserted. We are warned by circumstances, to which 1 will presently make more detailed reference, that any sudden assertion of the rights securedto us by the Treaty of 1854 would, in all m-oh-ihiKHr ,, Russia, whose remonstrances, although they wouW be aht 'j 1 ne cessity of explanations with our while to provoke without adequate causT alto ^ ther &gt;»egitimate, if ' ■ is not worth practical results of Major Sandernan's 21 . But one of the best and most to the present moment, is that in the course 'rV i, L iVAajor «andeman's mission, up S'wVr^hthemT 11101 ' 18 “ KheUt; “&gt; d the queetiou re now to consider is what 22. Are we to abandon, maintain, or develop them ? 23. The detachment of Biluch Guides if rr i • o, (with the Khan’s approval) it is proposed to furnish ^ 'f!~r l .

T| llhJra ' • he8e f tr00pS i reIi ™«&lt;! on the right we hold under the Treaty of 1854 to replace them again, at any future time, upon any portion of the Khan’s ter iW t must be remembered that, though we could do this legitimately, we could not do it mTetly nor Without attractmgto the sudden assertion of a dormant right a more general, and Saps a more embarrassing, notice than has hitherto been directed by the most suspicions rfoSr neighbours to the important, and, as I cannot but think, advantageous, fact that British troops have now, for many months, been located m Khelat. 1 25. It is, moreover, probable that the circumstances most likely to necessitate such a military intervention would also be most likely to render embarrassing the conditions, or serious the consequences, of it In the interests of all concerned, it is better that the presence of Bnteb troops m Khelat should be recognised as a guarantee against the possibility, than that it should be required as a defence, from the actual occurrence, of external attack. It is also better that, being in Khelat, these troops should remain there to protect the authority of an obedient Khan, who desires their continued presence as a favor to himself, than that they should at any future time, have to re-enter Khelat to punish the misdeeds of a recalcitrant Khan who might represent their entry as an act of aggression. 26 For all these reasons, there is, in my own mind, no doubt whatever that it would be an act of great imprudence to withdraw prematurely any portion of the British force now iu Khelat. It will be easy to elicit fiom the Khan a request for the continued presence of a small body of British troops to assist His Highness in carrying out the arrangements about to be concluded; and no foreign Power can legitimately, or practically, resent our friendly acquies cence in so reasonable a request. Indeed, on this point the only question which appears to me susceptible of serious discussion is, what degree of publicity it may be desirable to give to such an arrangement ? The third question has reference to the location of permanent British Residents in 27 various parts of Khelat; and on this point I need only say that I think it will be desirable that our arrangements with the Khan should include the assent of His Highness to the location of permanent British Residents at Khelat and Quetta. 28 Such are the special, and such the general, questions to be decided before any further progress can be made towards a satisfactory re-settlement of our relations with Khelat. 29 It remains to consider the form in which our decision on these questions can be most appropriately embodied and enforced. Appended to this note is the draft of a Supple mentary Treaty, which, if the terms of it be approved by my colleagues, I would propose to sign, with the Khan, on the occasion of an interview with His Highness, which can be easily arranged to take place in the course of my tour round the frontier this autumn. I call this convention a Supplementary Treaty, because it appears to me that the excellent Treaty of 1854 (which is the basis of all our acknowledged rights iu Khelat) has been, if not invalidated, at least so maltreated and discredited, by the unavoidable effect of recent events, as to render ex tremely desirable the public reaffirmation of its validity by each of the contracting parties. But, as the further arrangements now about to be concluded between the British Government and the Khan, in accordance with the results of Major Sandeman’s mission, will constitute a new point of departure in the development of our policy towards Khelat, involving on both sides privileges and obligations not anticipated by the terms of the treaty of 1854, and not covered by that contract, it is also desirable that all such mutual rights and obligations should be defined and sanctioned by some Supplementary Instrument. 30 Articles I, II, and III of the draft Supplementary Treaty require no^ explanation. Article IV raises the question which has already been considered in paragraphs 15, 16 , 17, and 18 of this note and settles it in the affirmative. 31. I need not here recapitulate all the arguments for and a-ainst our acceptation of the responsibilities to which we shall be committed by this article. Ihe opinions lecoidec \ my colleagues, in reply to my previous note on Khelat, have left me under the impiessionthat wg 'unanimously’ rGCOg'nisG, and arc prepared to accept, the necessity of a much more open and effective interference in the internal affairs of that State, than was previously found requisite for the maintenance of 13ritish # interests. Assuming, then, that such a* policy has already been decided upon, there can be.no doubt that the present is a singularly favorable opportunity for carrying it into effect; inasmuch as the influential position which the proposed article would secure to the British Government in K helat, instead of being forced on a reluctant Prince, and a resentful population, is now enthusiastically invoked by both the Khan and his Sirdars. If, however, we are to assume and exercise such an authority, it is obviously desirable—indeed I venture to think that it is absolutely necessary—to protect it by the sanction of an International Instrument, to which appeal can hereafter be made in case of need. The advantage of the position we secure by this article of the Supplementary Treaty appears to me unquestionable. From the date of its signature we shall be the virtual and recognized masters of Khelat without having incurred any of the inconveniences of annexation, or, so far as I can see, any obligation not already imposed upon us by the actual condition of that country, and a due regard for our own interests. 32. Article V is more open to cpiestion. It may be said that we can keep in Khelat, as long as we please, the small body of British troops already there, or even augment their number, without giving publicity to such an arrangement; and that it is inadvisable to attract the notice of the Bussian or Persian Government to any detail in the resettlement of our relations with Khelat which may have the appearance of a military precaution against foreign aggression. 33 . I have not disregarded, and I do not deny, the force of such arguments; but they appear to me less forcible than the arguments on the other side. We have never recognized any right on the part of Persia to interfere with, or cantrol, the course of our relations with Khelat, whatever those relations may be. Persia herself is not in a position to maintain any such pretension and, if she puts it forward, we may reasonably assume that she has done so at the instigation of Russia. This last named Power is the only one of sufficient importance to justify a moment's hesitation on our part in reference to the questions here under consideration. 31. Now, it is clear that Russia has no right whatever to question, or even to notice, any arrangement concluded between the British Government and its immediate neighbour, the Khan of Khelat. But, assuming that this will not prevent her from doing so, our choice of policy is practically limited to two alternative courses. Either we must refrain from doing anything which is in the least degree likely to provoke the irritation of Russia, however unjusti fiable such irritation may be; or whatever is done by us for the defence, or advancement, of our owui interests, must be done in such a manner as to invest the result with all the strength and authority of an accomplished fact, not susceptible of dispute, and from which the Govern ment of a first class Power cannot be expected, or requested, to recede. 35. If we adopt the first of these two policies, we shall find ourselves crippled, and hampered, at every turn, and the susceptibilities and pretensions of our Russian rival will rapidly increase in proportion to our detected fear of them. If we adopt the second, I sincerely believe that we shall strengthen the pacific, and check the aggressive, influences between which the Russian Government is now placed; and thereby benefit the best interests of Russia, no less than our own. 36. I confess I have a great faith in the force of accomplished facts. The Russian annexation of Khiva is an illustration of it, all the more instructive, because that proceeding involved a violation of pledges so flagrant as to justify a casus belli. But even Governments far more bellicose than our own are rarely prepared, when it comes to the point, to go to war for the reversal of facts already accomplished. 37. In connection with these general considerations, it is worth while to bear in mind the character of a conversation which took place on the 12th March 1875 between Count Schouvaloff and the Earl of Derby. 38. The Russian Ambassador, on that occasion, enquired whether English influence was being used in Khelat to prevent friendly relations between Persia and the Chiefs of Beloochistan. Lord Derby replied that the general object of our frontier policy was the maintenance of the status quo ; on behalf of which we desired to discourage, rather than excite quarrels between our neighbours. Shortly after this conversation. Count Schouvaloff returned to St. Petersburg!!, where he renewed it with Lord Augustus Loftus. Taking advantage of the reference made by Lord Derby to the status quo, the Count professed to have understood from the English Secretary for Foreign Affairs that the British occupation of Quetta would be acknowledged by us as a disturbance of the status quo, justifying a further advance on the part of Russia. The report of this conversation having been communicated to the India Office, Lord Augustus Loftus was informed that the right of stationing troops in any part of Khelat territory, inclusive of Quetta, is secured to the British Government by Article IV of the treaty of 1854. And subsequently (14th June 1875), in accordance with a recommenda tion by the Government of India, the English Ambassador at St. Petersburgh was instructed to communicate this information to the Russian Government, with a general assurance that it is not our intention to exercise the right thus reserved to us, except in case of necessity. There the matter dropped.39. Now, subsequent to tlie date of flip nbnvp mw,'™ a ■ Russian Government a body of British troops, acting as the escort ofTS^ A^ has Khanate 7 ' 0 ° PS ‘ S ’ the preSent m0m ™ t - sti11 ^tioned in the capita? 40 The question, therefore which we have now to consider is, whether it would be wrsest to leave th.s force m Khelat or to wrthdraw it? And, assuming that question to have been settled in favor of he first alternative the further question theS arises ; whether the British troops, at present m Khelat, should be left there in a surreptitious manner, subieet to the possibility of lemonstrances, from which we cannot appeal to the sanction of a ratified convention; or whether we should seize the present favourable opportunity of mvhm to such an arrangement the form of a friendly acquiescence in a request publicly made to us by our recognised ally and openly placing it on a footing which cannot be logically disputed, or reasonably resented, by any foreign Power. 41. The moial I am disposed to draw from the circumstance referred to in paragraph 36, is that, if we had been unable to put a summary end to the captious enquiries, and disin genuous assumptions, of the itussian Government, by referring that Government to the terms of a Treaty which establishes our rights beyond dispute, the insidious and unwarrantable dis cussion in which Count Schouvaloff endeavoured to entangle Lord Derby might have been indefinitely prolonged with great disadvantage to the relations between the two Governments. 1 would also remind my colleagues that, in the conversations which took place between myself and Count Schouvaloff before I left England, the Russian Ambassador endeavoured to excuse the aggressive policy of his Government by representing the vagueness, timidity, and insuffci- ent self-assertion, of our own policy as a main reason why the present Emperor is unable to restrain the inconvenient activity of his military advisers’in Central Asia. In short, I have no doubt in my own mind that Russian diplomacy is a game of brag, and that England^ safest policy, in her dealings with Russia, is a timely and resolute assertion of British rights and interests. In support of that opinion, I would again refer to the remarkable letter by Lord Palmerston, which was quoted in my Note, on our relations with Afghanistan. 42. There is another point which must not be omitted from the consideration of this question. The advantages of a branch line from the Indus Valley Railway to Dadur have, I believe, long been recognised by the Government of India. If we have already a small mili tary station in some part of Khelat, and if it be publicly understood that this station is main tained there, at the request, and with the concurrence, of the Khan; then the propriety of constructing such a line will not be open to question. But if we have no troops in Khelat, or if it be generally understood and declared that the presence of British troops in Khelat is a purely temporary and exceptional arrangement, incompatible with the normal condition of our relations with that State; then it might be difficult to find, for the construction of a rail-road to Dadur, any convenient, or satisfactory, pretext. Now, Major San demands mission cannot last for ever, nor can the arrangements he has effected for the pacification of that State be permanently regarded as dependent on the presence of British troops, and therefore, unless we enter into some public arrangement with the Khan, which will enable us, without the incon venience of further explanations, to keep British troops in Khelat as long as we may find it convenient to do so, I apprehend that we shall be practically obliged either to withdraw Major Sandeman’s escort sooner than may be expedient, or to seek and put forth some othei, and less, satisfactory pretext for not withdrawing it. The escort, once withdrawn, cannot reenter Khelat without raising many embarrassing questions; but it appears to me that we have now a golden opportunity, not only for keeping it there, but for excluding any question of our right to keep it there, as long as we please. 43. It is, I think, quite unncessary for us to come to any immediate decision as to the advantages, or disadvantages, of keeping it at or near Dadur; the moie so as tie omman ei in-Chief proposes to visit and inspect that locality early next year. mve, 01 . ns reason, abstained from mentioning any locality in the article which re eis o e mam euance British troops in Khelat. 44. Article VI needs no explanation. 45. In regard to Article VII, it will be remembered that in my previous Note on the sub ject of our relations with Khelat, I alluded to the importance of explormg the ground _ Seistan and Quetta ; and expressed the opinion that, if we line i mpossi o o for English Officers in Afghanistan, a telegraphic station at Quetta would fumi b us wrih „the best head-quarters for an Intelligence Department. In eoimec ion m . , , a p e ’ an early mention that it has been privately suggested to me yj^ehistan. His Lordship has opportunity of promoting a thorough exploration of y c , nrrcccdm^ in the pointed out the convenieiice and advantage of the pretex ot a mos si j j parties wav of espionage which is afforded by the management of a there whenever' we like. If we want to some tinrsty Agent lie gijeste other telegraphic station, with an electrician to test c • , Then, if we wish to the touts If our Indian newspapers, and can go about of a new ne of tele- to explore northward, we have only to discover the absolute necessity ot a[ cviii ] graph connecting Herat and Teheran, in order to avoid the danger of interruptions from snows or Biluchis. If our Agents are discovered suspiciously near Merv, they are only negotiating to secure our new line from Turkoman raids ; and, though the disguise may be transparent, it is quite thick enough for diplomatic answers to diplomatic representations. 46. Such are the views of the Secretary of State ; and I entirely concur in them. The negotiations, which appear to be already taking place, without any reference to the British Government, between the Ameer of Cabul and the Turkoman tribes, increase the importance of the abovementioned consideration ; and the present is the most favorable opportunity we have yet had, or are likely to have again, for increasing our freedom of action throughout Belooehistan under the sanction of treaty stipulations. Moreover, if we succeed in reopening friendly rela tions with the Ameer of Cabul, and convincing His Highness that closer intercourse between Afghanistan and British India will be advantageous to his own interests, it is in all probability from Quetta via Candahar, rather than from Peshawur vm the Khyber Pass, that telegraphic communication with Cabul could be most easily established and maintained. 47. Article VIII calls for no remark. From Article IX I do not anticipate much imme diate practical result; but it will be satisfactory to the British public, and affirm a principle of British policy, in which, to its honor, that public is warmly interested. 48. The motive of Article X has already been explained. It will be observed that by the terms of the Treaty reference is made to the Sirdars as well as to the Khan. My colleagues are aware of the great importance I attach to the maintenance of the Khan’s adequate autho rity and the preservation of an administrative unit in the political constitution of Khelat upon which we can concentrate responsibility. But I hold it no less essential to our interests that, in the present formal renewal of relations with the Khanate, we should not ignore the existence of a political power strong enough, if united against the Khan, to depose His Highness at any moment, or to give us much trouble, if united against ourselves ; more especially as it is in the Sirdars, as a body, that the British Government now finds the most enthusiastic supporters of its extended influence in Khelat. It would, I think, be imprudent either to recognize this body as an independent power in the State, or to exclude it altogether from all recognized res ponsibility in regard to the contract engagements of the State. 49. This draft Treaty will, I think, if approved by my colleagues, embody, in the most convenient and effective form, the broad principles of our future policy towards the State of Khelat, and adequately provide for our closer relations with its Ruler. But there are, of course, other matters of considerable importance which can only be settled by correspondence between the British Government and its Agent in that country; and this brings me to the consideration of the instructions with which Major Sandeman should now be furnished. 50. FI ere it is necessary to examine more carefully the Proclamation annexed to the last Khelat Diary of July 31st, and already referred to in the commencement of the present * Vide Appendix IX. Note * This Proclamation,* drawn up by Major Sandeman, and promulgated by the Khan, is a sort of new Constitution, or Code of Procedure, for the internal administration of Khelat. It divides the civil administration of the country into four parts; and in three, out of the four classes of cases arising therefrom, it makes the British Government a permanent Court of Appeal. The appeals open to the British Government, represented by its Agent in Khelat, appear to have no limitation, except that the Sirdars are first to carry out the decisions of the Khan, and then to appeal against those decisions to the British Agent; who is empowered to reverse them according to his own judgment. That judgment is to be final, and the impossibility of its guidance, by reference to the Supreme Government, will be obvious. In the first place, the subjects of appeal are so essentially local that only a local tribunal would be competent to deal w’th them. In the next place, they are so trivial that, in all probability, the appeals will be of daily occurrence. The question in dispute may be as to the amount of a few rupees worth of revenue in a fiscal case, or the duration of some brief term of imprisonment in a criminal case, of no importance. But, however trifling the case, or frivolous pretext, the Sirdar, if dissatisfied with the Khan’s decision, has a right of appeal, through the British Agent, to the British Government; and it may be reasonably anticipated that, if we sanction this arrangement, the time and attention of our Agent in Khelat will be chiefly occupied in the settlement of such cases. It is evident, moreover, that the right, accorded to the Sirdars, of appeal to the British Government in all such cases, involves the right of the British Govern ment, and with that right the responsibility, not only of investigating the cases referred to it, but of enforcing its decisions upon them: and, if the Brahooes are at all, like the other Oriental races inhabiting this Continent, we must expect that their right of appeal to our Agent will not remain a dead letter. In fact (and this information greatly aggravates our difficulty), Major Sandeman informs us that he is already engaged in hearing and deciding such appeals. Me must look to the practical working of such an arrangement as a permaneit part of the new constitution of Khelat. Now, if the decisions of the British Court of Appeal in Khelat should at any time be disregarded, or opposed, either by the Khan or the Sirdars, how are they to be enforced? To leave them unenforced will stultify the authority, and lower the prestige, of the British Government. But to enforce them will not only necessitate constant interference in the most domestic concerns of a foreign State; it will reduce the Khan to a posi-29 [ cix ] u ^ n out rebtbDS with all tl,ef™ti«Sta(^w^ t h er t,ibl r .’S^^m e 7 a rr f f Wt istan, even Kashmir), of such an arrantrement as tin’s It* it i i ue P, naent l^epal, Afghan- firmed by the Government of India. “nd con- (judging by the reports that have reached us from our own A-eU 3 ’' tl 0 '” 6 reaS011 , t0 f , ear Major Sandeman’s proceedings in Khelat, and his active inrorf'’. ’ ■' ,, ° . l( ' r sources) that that State, as the avowed, or supposed, protector of the Klrmd^'w'r'n' * ' e ni, '; 1 ' n '! a ® a ' rs o£ disturbing influence on the mind of the Ameer of Cabul 'ti 'V* '’T ™ ssa ' s &gt;' lav0 had a mistrust of British policy, and incre4 3 r eh,e t an' t n 3 t0 llis territorv. This will not much matter, if tile result of aI' 1 ^ nt,S ‘ “e * 66 '' 8 'T ithin his known, be generally recognized as advantageous to Khelat, t?d sushis to r Rut strengthened m h,s authority at home, without prejudice to the rights of his lub eets and better secured against danger from abroad without tlie purchase of protection on hnmi atinw terms. But what will be the sensations of the Ameer of Cahul when the finds that the resu S of Major Sandeman s proceedings in Khelat has been to reduce the Pr utterly destructive of his authority ? 51. I must also call attention to the preamble of this Proclamation, in which Maior Sandeman has put into the mouth of the Khan a public avowal that His Hi3mess has not only been misgoverning, but illegally governing, the country during the last few years It is impossible for me to reconcile Major SandemaiPs proceedings in this matter with the clear and stringent instructions I conveyed to him by telegraph, many weeks ago, to abstain from every thing likely to lower the dignity, or weaken the authority, of the Khan in the eyes of his subjects; and to do nothing which would commit the British Government to any permanent responsibilities, pending the receipt of further instructions. I cannot anticipate any doubt on the part of my colleagues as to the absolute impossibility of according our sanction to the arrangements embodied in this Proclamation. There is certainly no such doubt in my own mind. But, although Major SandemaKs indiscretion in regard thereto is, in my opinion, so serious as to justify his immediate recall and public censure, I am persuaded that the interests of the State would seriously suffer by our adoption of such a course. We have already deprived Sir William Merewether of his political functions in reference to Khelat, and have virtually destroyed the influence of our Sindh authorities in that country. We cannot afford to repeat such experiments on our own prestige, or to be continually discrediting our own Agents. So long, therefore, as our relations with Khelat remain unsettled, it will be necessary, I think, to uphold and support Major SandemaKs authority and influence in that country by eveiy means not absolutely incompatible with the maintenance of official discipline. 52. On this account alone, therefore, I deem it inexpedient to address official instructions to Major Sandeman at the present moment, or to pass any resolution in Council on the subject of his report. It would be absolutely impossible for me to take official notice of the results of his mission up to the present moment without severely censuring his conduct with reference to this objectionable proclamation. But such a proceeding would not only be painful, it would, I think, be highly inexpedient; and I am most anxious to avoid it. There are, moreover, other reasons why the issue of final and definite instructions to Major Sandeman would now be difficult and premature. Difficult, because we are even still very imperfectly acquainted with the character of the constitution we are asked to affirm and maintain, with the exact limits and true origin of those ancient rights and privileges we are to assure to the Sirdars, and also with the powers of the Khan, which appear to have practically varied according to the character and abilities of each reigning Prince;—premature, because Major SandemaKs last letter shows that his final report is, in no sense, final; because the month or six weeks, which must elapse between the despatch and receipt of our instructions, may materially alter the position to which they refer; and, finally, because the official renewal and permanent re-settlement of our rela tions with the Khan may he more satisfactorily concluded by means of a personal interview between myself and His Highness; which can be easily arranged to take place in the course of my tour round the frontier this autumn. The opinion, however, has been expressed by my colleagues that the earliest possible opportunity should now be taken for placing Major Sande man confidentially and completely in possession of the views of the Viceroy respecting the duties and objects of his mission, and the principles of the policy which should now regulate his conduct. I share that opinion, and believe that such timely and sufficient information for the guidance of our Agent is not only necessary in justice to him, but also, expedient lor the furtherance of the objects we have in view, and the prevention of much misunderstanding and embarrassment. 53. For all these reasons, therefore, I propose, with the assent of my colleagues, to avail myself of the pretext afforded by the Khaffis letter to my predecessor (which still remains unanswered) for instructing my Military Secretary, Colonel Colley, o piocee as soon as possi ble to Khelat, in a purely private and unofficial capacity, as the carer o my rep y o ns letter from His Highness, and a confidential communication to Major Sandeman. I do n t propose to invest Colonel Colley with any diplomatic powers, or with any official status, ot* Lord Carnarvon expressed to me, before I left England, the highest opinion of the great tact and ability with which Colonel Colley had successfully conducted the management of some very delicate affairs entrusted to him by His Lordship in Natal; and I have perfect confidence in his discretion. than the one he now holds as my Military Secretary, proceeding on a personal visit to Major Sandeman, with a private message to that officer, and a complimentary letter to the Khan, which he is charged to deliver in person. 54. Major Sandeman’s official position, therefore, will not be superseded, interfered with, or in any wise prejudicially affected, by Colonel Colley; but I propose to send by Colonel Colley a private and confidential letter to Major Sandeman, fully explaining the views and wishes of the Government of India on each of the questions discussed in this note, and authorizing him to expedite the conclusion of arrangements in accordance with those views and wishes. 55. With regard to the objectionable Proclamation, as Major Sandeman has got the Government into this scrape, I think we cannot do better than leave it to him to get us out of it, in such a manner as his experience of the facts and persons to be dealt with in Khelat may enable him to render least embarrassing to himself and to his Government. I anticipate great advantage to Major Sandeman, and very great advantage to myself and the public interests, from the opportunity which will thus be afforded that officer of privately conversing with Colonel Colley, and learning from him, in fuller and freer detail, than would be possible by means of either official or private correspondence, the precise views and wishes of the Viceroy. I am also hopeful that the cool and trained judgment of Colonel Colley* may prove helpful to Major Sandeman in the correction of any errors already committed by that officer; errors of which I am reluctant to take official notice, so long as there is any probability of his being able, and willing, to repair them by the exercise of his own ingenuity. 56. In accordance with this arrangement, I would privately instruct Major Sandeman to elicit from the Khan a personal request for the formal re-settlement of our relations with His Highness upon the terms embodied in the draft Supplementary Treaty, and the expression of a desire to meet the Viceroy this autumn for the purpose of signing such a Treaty. 57. It is my wish that, as soon as an agreement has been arrived at between myself and my colleagues on the subject of the present note, Colonel Colley should start, without delay, to Khelat, in order that he may be able to rejoin me, with the Khaffis answer and Major Sandemaffis latest report, in the latter efid of November at Peshawur. Nothing short of a very strong sense of the advantage to the public interests involved in this arrangement, and the great expediency of thus hastening and facilitating the satisfactory conclusion of Major SandemaiTs mission, whilst at the same time placing that officer in a better position to under stand and carry out the policy he will afterwards remain to represent, pending the re-organiza tion of our Frontier Government, would reconcile me to the great personal inconvenience of dispensing with the services of Colonel Colley during my journey through Kashmir. But I attach the very greatest importance to the prompt execution of the plan now explained and submitted to my colleagues, on whose acquiescence in it I trust I may reckon. I am very hopeful that the results of my interview with the Khan, and his signature of the proposed Treaty, will greatly strengthen the position it will be my duty to represent on behalf of the British Government at Delhi on the 1st January. I am also hopeful that the magnificence, importance, and popularity, of the proceedings on that occasion will give weight and authority to the policy embodied in the Treaty with Khelat ; and that the double effect of the two events will have an advantageous influence on our relations with other frontier States. The results I anticipate from Colonel Colley’s private interview with Major Sandeman will also, I trust, enable me to recognize the services of Major Sandeman with a cordial public approval, unqualified by those censures which I could not now omit from any official notice of his recent proceedings. 58. It only remains for me to say that I shall be greatly obliged if my colleagues will kindly r I turn the accompanying papers as soon as possible, and favor me, at their earliest con venience, with an expression of their opinions on the points now awaiting decision. Should the general concurrence of opinion be in accdrdance with the views I have expressed in this note, it will, perhaps, be unnecessary to discuss them further in Council. On the other hand, should there be any strong divergence of opinion on points of material importance, it will be desirable that the whole matter should be disposed of as soon as possible in special Council; as I am extremely anxious not to delay Colonel Colley’s departure longer than I can help; and any lengthened uncertainty in regard thereto will, I fear, embarrass the arrangements now being made for my frontier tour.

[Referred to in paragraph 14-, Chapter IF.] MEMORANDUM BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL T. E. GORDON, C.S.I., ON THE STRATEGICAL EFFECT OF HOLDING THE ISHKAMAN PASS IN YASSIN. The Russian occupation of Khokand is a rapid stride in the advance towards the Cash- mere frontier, and points to the advisability of strengthening our position on that frontier by all possible means in our power. The possession of Khokand places Russia at almost exactly 1 the same distance from the Baroghil Pass as the nearest Under 270 miles by road. British military station is. viz., Abbottabad in Hazara: and it may be safely said that a force starting from the Khokand frontier could reach Baroghil well before our troops, marching from that post. The former would proceed from the grassy plains aucl valleys of the Alai, the Kizilart, and the Pamir, crossing easy passes at no great height, and traversing a country the nature of which, as we know from personal experience at even the most unfavorable time of the year, admits of rapid travelling, while the latter would journey by a road which, in its present state, offers many physical obstacles to continued forced marches. 2 . If it be true, as represented in a late telegram, that the establishment of a permanent Russian Agency at the capital of Eastern lurkistan has been agieed upon with Kashgar, that, following upon the withdrawal of our Representative, must make Russian influence all powerful there, to &amp; the exclusion of our own, and commanded, as Kashgar is, in a military sense, from Khokand and Almati, the present Ameer must of necessity be “friendly” to Russia, and eventually this, the last remaining* independent Khanate of Central Asia, will be absorbed in the Russian Empire. In my special report on Kashgar, the Pamirs, and W akhan, of July last year, I remarked on the great importance of the situation of Kashgar, in considering the question of a hostile advance upon India from Khokand, and 1 showed that, should it be occupied by a Power friendly to the force advancing along the line indicated, it would be able to furnish supplies in food and carriage, which, with ordinary preparation, would be practically unlimited. 3. Mention has been made of the existence of a “Russian party” at the Court of Cabul. It has been reported that Russian Agents have visited Balkh; that Naib Alum Khan, the Governor there, Shore AlFs most trusted lieutenant, openly expresses his preference for Russia; that the English alliance is unpopular at Cabul; and that the people generally accept the fact of Russians advance towards India. And we know that Shere Ali himself has the strongest objections to English Agents or travellers entering his dominions. The Afghans may dream of acquiring territory in Cashmere and the Punjab, and thus possibly be led .at some future time to join in operations against our Indian possessions. It is only as auxiliaries to the enemy that they could become dangerous to us in India. The main armies, to which they would belong, would advance from the direction of Merv and the Oxus; and, under any circum stances of a forward movement into Afghanistan by Russian armies, whether as friends or foes, Balkh and Herat will almost certainly be in the main lines of advance. A glance at the map will show that Ishkaman in Yassin, with the valley of the Oxus before it, is a point of the greatest strategical importance, checking advance from the direction of the Pamirs, holding the Baroghil Pass, commanding Chitral and the tribes between that and the northern side of the Peshawar valley, threatening Jellalabad (210 miles, Cabul (315 miles), Balkh (390 miles), and the Oxus line of communications, and even menacing the Merv line. 4 . The road connecting Balkh and Herat, after passing through, or near, the towers of Aksha, Andikhoi, Shibbergan, Sir-i-pool, and Maimena, joins the Merv-Herat road at the Murghab stream near the Afghan frontier, about 230 miles from Balkh. This gives a distance of about 620 miles from Ishkaman to the point where the Merv road to Herat enters Cabul territory. 5. With the Afghans as our allies, Ishkaman would still be a most valuable position m enabling us to operate if the occasion ever arose, down the Oxus, without entering the moun tainous country of Cabul,—a very great advantage, when we consider the national character of the Afghans, and the jealousies and conflicting interests of the several contending parties to be met there. 6 . A road opened from Cashmere to the Ishkaman Pass would attract not only the Eastern Turkistan traders, who at present toil over the Karakorum, but also the Badaksban merchants, who trade with Peshawur through Cabul. Such a road, prepared for the purposes of trade, would be ready for the purposes of trade, would be ready for the purposes or an army at the shortest notice. The Maharaja of Cashmere is now showing a desire for closer relations with us than have hitherto existed.

It vi as Mir Futteh Adi Shah of AVakhan who first told me of the advantages of the Ishkaman Pass, mentioning it as leading to a road to Torbela via Gilgit and Chilas. It is a very remarkable fact, in these days of geographical search and discovery, that the Indus, which forms a strong inner line of defence along the whole of our north-western frontier from Sind to Ladak, is almost totally unknown to us in that small portion of its course between leaving Cashmere territory near Bungi (where it is bridged for the Gilgit road), and touching the Punjab frontier above Torbela. Chilas holds the intervening strip of country on the left bank, and is said to be subject to the influence, if not the rule, of Cashmere. It seems advis able to explore that tract to see whether a road does exist, or is practicable, by which Abbot- tabad may be placed in direct communication with Gilgit. This with the occupation of the valley from the Cashmere frontier at Gowkuch to the ishkaman Pass (40 miles), offers the great^advantage of securing in that quarter the Indus line of defence. Tfie 2nd November 1875. [CONFIDENTIAL.] Extracts from Report on Kashgar, the Pamirs and Wakhan, by Lieutexant-Coloxel T. E. Goedox, dated - 14th July 1874. The passes into Chitral have been described in a separate report by Captain Biddulph. Both the Baroghil and Ishkaman have had guns taken over them within the last few years. By the former, the British frontier can be reached in thirteen marches via the Mastnch, Chitral, and Panjkora valleys. By the latter, Torbela on the Indus is reached in the same time via Gilgit, Chelas, and the Indus Valley. Mir Futteh Ali Shah of Wakhan made special mention of the latter as the best and nearest road to India. The importance of Kashgar on the flank of such an advance is apparent. As long as it remains in hands friendly to us, no such advance could be made without the certain risk of the communications being cut by irregular troops from the Terek Pass, the Gez-T)awan via Opal, and Sirikol, while aid in arms and money could be sent with perfect safety across the Karakorum. In the event of Kashgar being in unfriendly hands, and so being liable to be used as a base of operations against India, the occupation of Gilgit and the Ishkaman Pass would appear sufficient to check an attack from the direction of the Pamirs. No hostile ^ orc ® could cross the Baroghil Pass in the face of one holding the Ishkaman. I assume that in such a case Cashmere would become practically British territory. The distance from Gowkuch, tie Cashmere frontier village, to the Ishkaman Pass, along a valley, through a t in y popu ate country, is about 40 miles.[ cxiv ] Grass in abundance, fuel and water are obtainable on the routes from Khokand to Cliitral. These roads are closed for all tbe practical purposes of an arni\ dunng 1 the months of Feb ruary, March and April, but for the rest of the year they are easy of passage. Extracts from Report on Sirikol, the Pamirs and Wakhan, by Lieutenant-Colonel T. E. Gordon, dated 17th August 1874. The road between Sirikol and Hunza, Kunjut, is remarkably easy, and is open the whole year round. The journey occupies from five to seven days. The Taghdungbash Pamir slopes appear to lead gradually up to the crest of the mountains, and the descent to Kunjut is said to be equally easy. I obtained this information from Russulla, a native of Jummu, and formerly a soldier in the service of the Maharaja of Cashmere, who was taken prisoner in K unjut and sold into slavery. A daughter of Ghazan Khan, the Chief of Hunza, is one of the many wives of the Atalik. The plundering and slave stealing propensities of the robber Kunjutis are now most effectually restrained by the Atalik. Mir Futteh Ali Shah of Wakhan also takes credit to himself for this improved state of things. He says that,, at the AtalilCs request, he used his influence with Ghazan Khan, and induced him to order the discontinuance of robbery by his people on the Yarkand and Thibet road. Elchis (Envoys) pass frequently from Hunza to the Atalik, who appears to keep up constant communication in the same manner with Wakhan, Badakhshan, Shighnan, Karategin, and most of the small States in iurkistan. Jehandar Shah is still in Chitral. He is related to Sirdar Abdul Rahman Khan, and looks to his coming for the recovery of his lost rule in Badakhshan. The Chitralis are in dread of annexation by the Ameer Shore Ali, and hope for Abdul Rahman's success as a means, through Jehandar Shah's good offices, to secure the continuance of their independence. They make no secret of their intention to welcome a Russian force, believing that such will soon come in aid of Abdul Rahman. Abdul Rahman is said to hold the position of Mir Akhur Bashi (chief master of the horse) in the Russian service at Samarkand. Sher Afzul, an exiled brother of Aman-ul-Mulk, lately went to Cabul to offer his services to the Ameer against the Ruler of Chitral, and Mir Wali of Yassin, the son-in-law, made a similar offer to Mahomed Alum, the Mir of Balkh and Badakhshan. It was believed that the Afghan troops would advance from Faizabad with the view of taking Chitral, immediately the passes became free from snow; but it is probable that the quarrel between Shere Ali and his son, Yakoob, put a stop to the proposed expedition and annexation. Besides the Baroghil cr mmunicating with Chitral, two other passes lead from Wakhan, one from Yur, eighteen miles below Surhud, and the other from Yost. These, however, can only be used by men on foot. It was very pleasing to us to find that we were kindly welcomed by the Rulers of these outlying Afghan provinces, immediately the news of our arrival at the frontier reached them. Every incident of our treatment in Wakhan proved the English Government to be honored and respected, and its prestige to be recognized in a manner beyond what it has been usual of late to suppose. In the course of my frequent conversation with the Mir of Wakhan, I observed that he had a very fair knowledge of affairs in India. He asked me about the mutiny of 1857, and remarked that our soldiers were natives of the country, referring to the sepoys accompanying us. I explained all to him, on which he mentioned having seen Feroz Shah at Panja on his way from Shighnan to Chitral. He repeatedly asked why Ibrahim Khan was so long in returning, and what was the cause of delay in obtaining permission to proceed to Badakh shan and Cabul. I had to tell him of Shere Ali's difference with Yakoob Khan as preventing the Ameer from making the required arrangements for the journey and reception of the Embassy. He said on one occasion—“ Do the English really intend to take the whole country from Kashgar to Herat ? I am with them, for the approach of the c Russ’ must drive me out of Wakhan.” He seemed to think that an object in our visit was to obtain information with reference to a Russian advance. One of the first speeches he made at our first meeting was that a Russian had lately visited Muhammad Alum at Takhtapul, and was believed to have gone on to Cabul. A propos of nothing on the subject, he said one day —“ I intend to tell you, before leaving, of a good road to India.' Fie afterwards mentioned this road as lying over the Ishkaman Pass to Torbela on the Indus via Gilgit and Chelas. He spoke very confidently of the excellence and advantage of this route as an alternative to that by the Baroghil Pass and the Chitral Valley. Captain Biddulph's report on the Chitral Passes has already been furnished. It describes the Baroghil, the Darkot, and the Ishkaman. Captain Biddulph found them all closed by heavy snow (end of April), the winter this year having been unusually severe and late. B e &gt; however, was able to reach close to the summit of the Baroghil, and ascertained that its remarkable facilities of passage had not been exaggerated. The Ishkaman is as accessible as-23?)

I feel sure that the high respect in which the British Government is held there, as shown by their treatment of us 3 will always cause them to welcome and protect any Englishmen who may travel that way. J Extracts from Report on the CUtral Passes by Captain J. Biddulph. While we were at Kila Panja, Mir Futteh Ali Shah spoke to us about the most direct road to India being over the Ishkaman Pass by Gilgit, Chilas and Torbela. He stated that the Pass was m every way as easy as the Baroghil, but less frequented. I was, therefore, despatched by Colonel Gordon to return across the Little Pamir, and gather as much informa tion concerning the passes leading into Chitral from the upper part of the Oxus valley as the season would permit. Leaving Surhud on the 29th, I crossed the river into the Pirkar valley, south of Surhud. At the entrance to the valley, on high rock to the right, are remains of an ancient fort stand ing on a bit of level ground called Sirigh Chowpan. For two miles the valley runs due south, and is from 500 yards to 700 yards wide. This bit of two miles is covered with fine grass, and perfectly level, so much so that travelling along it was difficult from the deep and swampy state of the ground caused by imperfect drainage. In summer, however, it becomes dry and good. At Pirkar the valley narrows and bends for three-quarters of a mile to south-west, then opens out, and at one mile from Pirkar is village of Zerkar on right; then for a mile and a half it bends still more to the west, and ends in a sort of cul-de-sac, the last half mile being over pebbly water-course. To the south and west the mountains seem to melt away, and no sharp peaks are visible. From the end of the cul-de-sac a track leads up mountain side due south to the Ishkaman Paas; another track leads nearly due west to the Baroghil. Following the latter up a steepish ascent of 300 feet, the road runs for three-quarters of a mile along face of hill south-south-west, overlooking torrent into a kind of upper valley. From top of the ascent the snow-drifts were so heavy that horses could not travel, and I had to push on on foot. In the upper valley are the stone huts of Baroghil on a long ridge on the right. They were nearly buried in snow, being only used in the summer, as also the other villages of Pirkar and Zerkar. Continuing on up the valley, which is covered with turf in summer, about 400 yards wide, with extremely gentle ascent, I was at last able to get a full view of the pass. 'Lie crest of it, if such an expression can be applied to so gentle a slope, was apparently not above 200 feet higher than the ground on which I stood, a mile and a quarter from it. By boiling water I ascertained the approximate height of the Pass to be 12,300 feet, or less than 1,000 feet higher than Surhud. From Surhud to the top of the Pass is not more than 10 | or 11 miles. By order of Mir Futteh Ali Shah, I was accompanied by the Aksakal of the Surhud District, who, describing the pass in summer, said that a horse can gallop without checking from Baroghil Ailak (summer village) to Derbend, the foot of the pass in Chittial. The pass is closed from two to three months in the end of winter and beginning of spring; but this year it was closed later than usual, owing to the unusually severe winter. About one mile short of the top of the Baroghil Pass is the path leading up hill side on left to the Durkote Pass. The top of this I could not see, and the first bit of ascent is steep. It is closed four months in the year. The village of Durkote m Yassra is only one day s march from Surhud.[ CXTi ] South-east of Baroghil Ailak is a track leading 1 up the hill side to the Ishkaman Pass, ioinino- the track previously mentioned up to the same pass. The first few hundred feet seemed steep^ and X could not see the top of the Pass^ which is said to be a very long one^ hut I gathered from the Aksakal that there was little more ascent than what 1 saw. As the Pass is closed for the same period as the Baroghil, the height must he about the same. As a road, however, it is not quite so good, but a very small amount of labour would make either of the two good for guns. The Aksakal told me that guns were taken over the Ishkaman Pass twelve years ago by Meery Shah (Mir Jehandar Shah), Mir of Badakhshan. Between the Baroghil Ailak and the top of the pass is a pasture ground much resorted to in summer, known as Showashir. Crossing the pass three roads diverge to Kunjut, Gilgit and Yassin. On the Gilgit road the village of Eemit, belonging to Yasin, is reached on first day from Baroghil Ailak; Gowkuch, the frontier village, belonging to Cashmere on the second day, so that there is absolutely but little more than one day's march between Wakhan and Cashmere territory. Grass, wood, and water are abundant the whole way from Surhud to Baroghil. The Ishkaman Pass is sometimes known as the Karanahar, but the former is the best known name. The heavy snow lying on the soilthern side of the valley prevented my attempting to see more of the Durkote or Ishkaman Passes, and I had considerable difficulty in reaching the point I did. The pass in general use between Mastuch and Yassin is called the Tawee Dawan; it is closed in winter, when a longer road by Tagawee is used. To any one possessing a tolerably extensive knowledge of the Himalayas, this break in the great mountain barrier that separates India so completely from the rest of Asia cannot fail to offer itself as a geographical feature that must at some time bear on our political attitude towards the rest of the Continent. The routes into Central Asia, which converge at Leh, lie for many marches through one of the most bleak and desolate countries in the world; and, though in old times raids may have been made by small undisciplined bands at favorable seasons across the Karrakorum, the passage of an army, able to threaten our supremacy in India, is out of the question. By the Chitral or Gilgit routes, however, and crossing either the Baroghil or Ishkaman Passes, the traveller goes through a gate by which, without being for one day away from human habitations, he is practically landed in Central Asia in a single march. When, in addition to this, it is remembered that these passes are open for ten months in the year, and that guns have been taken across both of them within the last few years, and in the course of local warfare, the situation becomes full of interest. Looking further, we now know that from the Russian southern frontier to Surhud in Wakhan, the difficulties of transporting troops are comparatively small. The most important strategical point of Russian frontier is Osh in Khokand, the whole of which country may be considered, for all practical purposes, as Russian territory. Assuming that a force might be assembled at Osh for offensive purposes, the information we gained of the Pamir roads from the Kirghiz shows that there is nothing to prevent the rapid advance of an army fully equipped to within a few miles of Surhud. Not only is no road-making for the passage of field artillery necessary, but along the whole distance there is an unlimited quantity of the finest pasture in the world. The old saying, recorded by Marco Polo, u that a lean horse gets into condition in ten days on the Pamir,' still holds good, and we were positively warned against giving grain to our horses while crossing, lest we should make them ill. Arrived within thirty miles of Surhud, road-making for guns becomes necessary; but a strong' advanced guard, supported by mountain train batteries, would effectually secure the work from interruption, and the scanty poorly armed population of Wakhan can offer to opposition worth mentioning'. From Surhud to the top of either of the Passes, not above one mile and a half of road needs preparing for the passage of field guns, and the invader finds the choice of several routes open to him. By the Baroghil Pass he can follow the course of the Mastuch stream to Chitral, whence he can threaten both Jellalabad and Peshawur; or, crossing by the Ishkaman Pass, be can reach Gilgit in three marches, and from there threaten the Punjab either by Cashmere or the Toibela route. Ibis latter would in all probability offer the greatest physical obstacles; but the ceitain co-operation of the disaffected people of Swat offers counterbalancing advan tages, while both the routes by the Ishkaman Pass have the advantage of turning the Indus line of defence.. It is probable that the roads from the Passes to the plains of India need some preparation before bodies of troops can be brought by any of them; but this will tell as much against the[ cxvii ] defending forces as against the invader. None of them present any great natural „!„) ele and once m possession of the Passes, a powerful enemv will 1 „, .,lx, ,„d i 7 sl ' le &gt; to which the defending army must eorform. 7 Me t0 take a stron S lmt,atlre Any one who considers the question cannot fail to be much struck by the o-reat ignorance that prevails concerning the countries immediately beyond our border. It is hardly ^ gelation to say that we know more of the geography of parts of Central Africa than of counMes lymg at our own door It is now nearly 26 years since the battle of Gooierat made us mastirs of Northern India and oar geographical knowledge of the countries I have mentioned remtins much what it was then. Long before British soldiers had been seen on the banks of the Sutlej, British officers were often deputed, and always encouraged, by Government to extend our knowledge of surrounding countries and it is well known how useful the knowledge thus gamed afterwards became. Of late years, however, Government has pursued an opposite course and positively prohibited individuals from travelling beyond our frontier. That there are good reasons for this, I am well aware; but there is a point beyond which the advantages to he gamed quite outbalance the corresponding risks. To such an extent does our geographical ignorance prevail that the frontiers of our Cashmere tributary are unknown to us. The maps issued each year by the Survey Department show constant alterations in the Cashmere frontier line, which is alternately advanced and retired in a way that shows its position to be little better than conjectuial. Such a state of things is not creditable. Now, with regard to the Gilgit frontier, it is to be noticed that the Cashmere officials have shown a marked dislike to any British officer travelling in that direction. Among the many who visit Cashmere each year, there are always some who are ready to seek for new hunting grounds j but di rectly their steps are turned towards Cilgit, every effort is made to discourage the attempt. Supplies and carriage are procured with difficulty, local information is studiously withheld, and game is systematically driven away. I have even heard it said that no Englishman has ever been allowed to travel on the direct road from Srinuggur to Gilgit, which is open all the year round. What is the reason for this I will not stop to consider ; but it may fairly be argued that the time has arrived when the British Government should insist on obtaining the knowledge it has a right to possess. There is another view of the question which deserves consideration. We have lately made 'considerable efforts to open up trade with Central Asia, and have also contracted certain, though somewhat undefined, obligations by our late Treaty with the Ameer of Kashgar, and by the establishment of the Oxus as a boundary between ourselves and Russia. The knowledge we now possess of the Chitral Passes and the countries beyond points conclusively to the real trade route being by Gilgit. The advantages of the road are well known to traders, but the rapacity of the Aman-ul-Mulk has effectually closed it. Instead of reaching their markets by a few easy marches, traders are obliged to take a long roundabout road over the Karakorum, at great risk of life to themselves, and greatly enhanced cost to their merchandise. Under these circumstances, the occupation of the valley from Gowkuch to the Ishkaman Pass, now belonging to the Aman-ul-Mulk, by theMaharaja of Cashmere, offers the greatest advantages. Not only will the trade, which now makes its way painfully over many hundred miles of wilder ness, find easy access to the markets of Central Asia, and be in a position to compete success fully with Russian trade, but the establishment of a good road will be of great military advan tage to the Government. British influence will become a fact in Central Asia, where it is at present little more than a name, and we shall be in a position to give effectual support to our new ally in Kashgar, or to the Mir of Wakhan. We might go even a step further. The murder of Mr. Hayward affords us ample justifi cation for annexing Chitral and Yassin to the territories of the Maharaja of Gashmeie. ibis would enormously increase our powers of defence. The possession of Badakshan and W akhan by Russia would then be immaterial to us, as the Hindu Kush would become our actual frontier. The turbulent and fanatical Swat tribes would be effectually bound over to keep the peace, and Cabul will lie open to us should circumstances ever demand an advance on Jellalabad. 31APPENDIX XIII.

His Highness evinced great interest in the objects of our journey, and promised his Hearty co-operation of the Maharaja. ; ieart . v co-operation in every arrangement necessary J to secure success. 1 may here mention that this promise was loyally kept throughout. No trouble or expense was spared by His Highness to secure our safety and accomplish the result in view. Without divulging the official nature of our journey, stringent orders were issued to all officials with whom I was brought in con tact to carry out my washes or orders in every particular without hesitation, and to furnish me without reserve with any information I might require. 3. Previous to my, meeting the Maharaja I found that steps had been taken to further . , x the objects of our journey by entering into nego- tiations with the rulers ol Chitrai and Yassin. A request had been received from those Chiefs a short time previously for the establishment of closer friendship with Cashmere, and advantage had been taken of this to invite the mission of Y^assin and Chitrai officials of high standing to Jummoo. These officials were expected to arrive at Gilgit early in July, and it was thought that their presence in Cashmere during the time of our stay in Yassin territory would prove a security against any hostile act on the part of the Yassin authorities. 4. We left Srinuggur on the 17th May and reached Boonjee on 3rd June. From there T . rv-i - we diverged from the direct road to Gilgit and occupied ourselves in shooting among the moun tains north of the Indus and in that way reached Gilgit by the end of the month. English officers travel so seldom beyond the Indus in this direction, that considerable notice was attracted by our movements, but it was not supposed that we were travelling for any other object except sport. On reaching Gilgit I found that the expected Vakeels from Yassin and Chitrai were not likely to arrive for some days. 5. While in seach of sport I went to Niomal, the Maharaja’s frontier village on the r u i tt Hunza side, which no British officers have visited since Io45-4o when Lieutenants Vans Agnew and Young visited the spot. The news of my being on the frontier was carried to Hunza, and it was also known that I was one of the party of officers who visited Wakhan in 1874. Two days after I had reached Gilgit a letter was brought to me from Ghazan Khan, the Mir of Hunza, inviting me to visit his country: he said that he was the uncle of Meer Ali Murdan Shah of Wakhan, and wished for the same friendship to be extended to him by the British Government that had been shown to his nephew; and that I if desired to visit Wakhan again, he would give me a passage through Kunjoot. 6 .

In the course of further conversation they informed me tha Peihlowan Bahadoor was on his wav from Mastuch with a force to attack'his brother Malik Aman in Tangir. Betoie they took leave of me I took occasion to tell them that the practice of slave-dealing is highly disapproved of by the British Government. 9. While at Gilgit I received the following account of Meer Wulli’s death last year. The death of Meer WuUi. taking forty men he crossed the Baroghil Pass . * rom Wakhan travelling as secretly as possible hoping to reach Tangir or Patrak. Near Mastuch some of his followers being pressed for food entered a deserted house and took away some provisions, which led to their discovery. Word was brought to Noor Hayat, Peihlowan Khan's foster-father, at Mastuch, on which he collected some men and surrounded Meer W ulli’s party at Chuinja. Desultory firing was kept up for several hours in the course of which six of Meer Wulli's men were killed and himself wounded. As he lay on the ground Noor Hayat's son approached him sword in hand. With a last effort Meer Wulli drew a pistol and shot him dead, being cut down himself at the same instant. So Hayward's murder was avenged. Noor Playat himself was wounded in the fray. 10 . I may here mention that though there is little doubt that there existed a genuine Motives of Peililowan Bahadoor for killing Meer desire to take Meer Wulfi alive and surrender him Wulll&gt; in order to secure the large reward offered by the Cashmere Government, Peihlowan Bahadoor's chief reason for proceeding against him was to rid himself of a dangerous rival whom he had already made a mortal enemy of by ousting him from Yassin. 11 . On the 13th August I left Gilgit for Hunza which I reached on the 18th. Up to the Visit to Hunza. last efforts were made to induce me to alter my decision as to the Wuzeer's son going to Gilgit during my stay in Kunjoot. Instead of coming into Gilgit before my departure as promised, I arrived at Boodlus, the Kunjoot frontier village, without meeting him, and it was not till I had expressed my determination of not proceeding further that he started for Gilgit. 12. The distance from Gilgit to Hunza is about 52 miles, and lies along the right bank j . TT of the Kunjoot river for the whole way, through Road from G.lgit to Hunra. the ¥ilIages J o£ Niomal; chellat, Boodlus, Myoon, and Hini. Between these places the road winds over the face or at the foot of bare and precipitous rocks. In many places where the rocks project into the river narrow stone staircases have been built up allowing of the passage of ponies with difficulty. But on the frontier between Niomal and Chellat the path has been purposely left in its natural state. For nearly half a mile we had to scramble over rocky ledges, sometimes letting ourselves down nearly to the water's edge, then ascending three or four hundred feet above the stream holding on by corners of rock, working along rocky shelves three or four inches wide, and round projecting knobs and corners, where no four-footed animal could find a path. In all my sporting experiences 1 have never crossed such a place. In winter the road fiom Gilgit to Hunza can be traversed by horses as the bad parts can be avoided by crossing and leciossmg the river, which at the time of my journey was impassable. 13. At Hini 13 miles from Hunza I was met by the Meer's eldest son Mahomed Sufdar Ali Khan, a young man of about 17 years Reception at Hunza. of ^ who esc0 rted me to Hunza where I was met by Ghazan Khan, who came two miles to meet me. He is a short, ver) stout man of about forty years of age, with features betokening intemperance. e receive I VVcordially, and expressed his wish for the friendship of the British Government making frequent allusions to Mr. Haywards murder and complaining that Meer Wulli had given a bad name to all the Yaghestan Meers. 14. Though Ghazan Khan's power extends over a wide extent of country the population is almost entirely confined to the narrow valley of Description of kunjoot. the Kunjoot river. The amount of ground capa ble 0 f cultivation is very limited. What cultivation exists is extremely good, and much superior to any other that I saw in Dardistan including Cashmere territory. Fruit of all kinds cn-ows in great profusion, and forms the only food of the people for part of the year. The population amounts to between six and seven thousand souls, and frequent difficulty is experienced from scarcity of food. So urgent is this that during the fruit season no bread is allowed to be consumed, and the owner of any house in which a fire is made is liable to punishment. Wine is made from grapes and drunk without concealment: the tenets of the Muglee* sect to which the Kunjootees belong allowing it. 15. The Kunjootees are in person rather small and slight compared with other Dards ; when young they have handsome faces generally Character of the Kuniootees. characterised by a very acute expression. They bear an evil reputation amongst their neighbours for great cunning and for the raids they make from time to time. All prisoners taken on these occasions are sold as slaves to the Kirghiz on the Pamir and into Badakshan. 16. At the time of my visit a Badakshi slave merchant was present in Hunza. Twice, in 1847 and 1866, a Cashmere force was sent Relations with Cashmere. Hunza ; n revenge f or attacks ma de on Gilgit, but both attempts ended in disaster. Secure in the difficult nature of the road into their country they have been able to set the Dogra power at defiance. The Maharaja now secures partial immunity from attacks by the payment of money and large yearly presents. Five years ago they made a sudden raid on the village of Niomal and carried of all the inhabitants. By the payment of a large sum of money the Cashmere authorities procured the restoration of all the Dard portion, but the Cashmerees amongst them were never recovered. 17. To the north they have not fared so well of late, and more than once complaints , were made to me that the strong arm of the Relations wx \asigar. Ameer of Kashgar deterred them from robbing the caravans between Leh and Shahidulla. Last year a raid on the Taghdoongbash Pamir was made and some Kirghiz with horses and flocks of sheep carried off. On this a force was sent by the Governor of Sirikol which took and destroyed the fort of Misgar, five marches from Hunza, and compelled Ghazan Khan to make restitution. All raids are carried out under the orders of the Meer. 18. I could not learn that any Russian agent had ever visited the country, but the Meer made frequent allusions to that power which apparently holds a prominent place in his estima tion. Arms are very scarce, and I do not think I saw over two hundred matchlocks during my stay in the country. Sword and shield is the ordinary equipment of the Meer's followers, and the use of bows and arrows is not yet altogether obsolete. A double-barrelled gun of Russian make was shown me, and I saw several match locks both in Hunza and Gilgit said to be of Russian manufacture. 20. Dancing is a favourite amusement of the Kunjootees, and they will sit for hours watching the dancing of one of their number : the movements of a sword dance that they perform are very spirited. 21. The elevation of Hunza is 8,400 feet: it may be described as a long crescent formed -p. . . „ „ by the hills receding from the river, with the escup ion o unza. points towards the south. At each end is a strong torrent flowing from the glaciers on the peaks which are visible to the north. The cultivation extends about seven miles in length by one and a half in depth. This is mostly terraced down to the river, but is undulating and much broken in parts. It is divided into eight districts, Naraydass, Assanabad, Doorkun, Hyderabad, Aliabad, Ganish, Baltit, and Altit: each district has its own fort. The fort of Baltit is close to the Meer's house which stands perched up above everything else like the palace at Leh. The ground is thickly wooded, the whole eastern end being covered with fruit orchards. 19. Estimation of Russia. The use of money is unknown. Warlike capabilities. * A sect of Shiahs who worship Ali and pay yearly tribute of a tenth of all produce to Aga Khan of Bombay. The conntry is divided into districts, each of which has a Pir who collects the tribute reserving a certain portion for himself; the rest is sent to Aga Khan once in three years. The people of Huuza, Wakhan, Shignan, Sirikol, bassw, and 1,200 houses in Chitral belong to this sect.32 22 .

The population of Nagr is about 10,000 souls. The people are less warlike than the Kunjootees, and bear a somewhat better reputation. Slavery in Nagr is unknown, nor do the people make raids beyond their borders like the Kunjootees. The Meer Jaffer Khan is on more friendly terms with Cashmere than Ghazau Khan. Of his fourteen sons, two hold jagheers and live in Cashmere territory. 26. On the Nagr side the cultivated ground is narrower, and from two to three hundred feet lower than on the Hunza side. A large stream from the south-west joins the main river nearly opposite the centre of Hunza. The fort and Meer’s house of Nagr is on the south side of this stream, about three miles from the junction. The part facing Hunza is divided into four districts with forts, viz., Shayar, AskoArdass, Chittorkun, Swayar. The river between the two States flows between perpendicular banks three hundred feet high and six hundred feet wide at the top, which can only be ascended in a few places, which are carefully guarded. There is a twig bridge nearly opposite the fort of Hyderabad which is also guarded. 27. In both Kunjoot and Nagr every village has one and sometimes two well kept „ . ^ _ forts capable of holdino' all the neighbouring orts in xvmi]oo an a g r - inhabitants. These forts are all alike, of irregular construction of mud brick walls, 15 feet high, with square towers at intervals of twenty yards. 28. A constant feud exists between Hunza and Nagr, though no overt hostilities have occurred for several years. This bad feeling be- Relations between Hunza and Nagr. tweeu tbe tw0 states enables the Cashmere Gov ernment to exercise some small authority over both, but an attack on either would probably make them combine against the common enemy. 29. The hostile feeling was higher than ever at the time of my visit, on account of the fort of Chaprote, which less than a year ago Quarrel regarding chaprote. i nto the possession of Nagr.

He also liberally furnished me, which 34. Finding that my 35. 36. Leave Hunza. Invitation to visit Nagr. 32. Consequently when I asked Refusal of passage to Wakhan. gave me to understand that Ali Murdan Shah might get into trouble with the Ameer of Cahul ff he received me. In addition to the presents I had given him I promised to give him one of my breech-loading guns, which he coveted greatly, on my return to Gilgit, if he would throw the road open to me. He refused, partly not trusting to my performing my promise, and partly because he believed that 1 should go on to Yarkund and not attend to his interests. He said more than once that if I could procure him the restoration of Chaprote, the whole of his country should be open to me to travel in. 33 . I have reason to believe that if I had not insisted on the presence of the WuzeeFs son in Gilgit during my stay in Hunza, an attempt Risk of detention. would have been made to detain me, in the hope of forcing the Cashmere Government to procure the restitution of Chaprote. Ghazan Khan constantly pressed me to write to the Governor of Gilgit to send back the Wuzeer’s son on the plea that the administration of the country was at a stand-still in his absence, but I refused to do so. On my first arrival in the country an attempt also was made to get me to dismiss the Giloit porters, so as to make me dependent on the country. Supplies of all kinds were ’ ' ' I paid for. further progress was impracticable, I left Hunza on the 22nd. Before leaving I showed the Meer some practice by a sepoy of the Guides with a Snider rifle at six hundred yards which seemed to impress him greatly. I received a verbal invitation from Meer Jafter Khan to visit Nagr, but the feeling between the two States ran so high that it would have been unwise to have attempted it. At C hell at I diverged to Chaprote, where I was received and entertained hy Usir Khan, a handsome young man, the son of ■V isit Chapiote. the Meer of Nagr. Shah Murad, the Wuzeer of Nagr, also met me having brought a letter from the Meer with the present of a shawl. He was accompanied by Bheram AH, another son of the Meer, a boy of 12 years old. 37 . The fort of Chaprote is situated in the angle formed by the junction of two streams with high precipitous banks. It can therefore only be approached from one side. Its possession by Cashmere would enable that Government to exercise real influence in both Jiunza ond Nagr. 38. I remained at Chaprote two days, and attempted from there to find a way across . the mountains into the Karopmbur valley. I Return to i git. crossed the first range into the Nulter valley at a height of over 17,000 feet, but found that the road runs for several miles over a glacier which has formed of late years, and is now never used, and a spell of bad whether forced me to return to Gilgit down the Nulter valley and through Niomal. 39. It is doubtful whether at any time of year a road could now be found by the way I wished to go, though I was told that fifty or sixty years ago a Yassin force with horse and foot came by this road and attacked Nulter. Owing to some reason a glacier has formed at the head of the Nulter valley where none existed formerly. 40. From Gilgit I marched towards Yassin by the usual road through Payal, turning aside into the Karoombur valley at 45 miles beyond Gilgit. Continuing up the valley for 28 miles I reached Eemit, the furthest village, without opposition. Here I was obliged to halt, as the villagers told me that without permission from Yassin they would not allow me to proceed. Otherwise they were friendly, and supplied me with what provisions I needed on payment. 41. Meanwhile the Governor of Gilgit had written to Meer Peihlowan Bahadoor to say T , u , j that I had gone into his country for purposes of sport, and cautioning him against oneiing me uncivil treatmqpt. In consequence of this a Syud was sent to me from lassin, and reached me at Eemit bearing a letter from the Meer, saying that I was welcome to shoot or travel in any part of his territory. The Syud told me that he was instructed to convey to me privately the MeeFs dissatisfaction at my having entered his country without asking Ins consent; but that the MeeFs wish is to be on friendly terms with the British Government, and that if I desired to visit Wakhan, no impediment would be offered me. 42. Without further delay I started for the Karoombur Pass, but at fourteen miles beyond Eemit I found further progress impossible. At an elevation of 9,900 feet a glacier has pushe Fort of Chaprote.

This must be always liable to occur from time to time, and it might easily happen on such an occasion that so large a portion of the glacier may be swept away as to clear the main valley sufficiently to allow of its being easily traversed for a longer or shorter period till the glacier action again closes it. 45. Though it is now only used in winter, the Yassinees consider the pass of much Present use of the pass. importance, because it is not closed by a gorge on the south side like the Baroghil and Durkote Passes, and is therefore less easily defended : I was told that they are especially anxious to keep its existence a secret from the Cabul authorities. 46. From Gilgit to Eemit men on foot travel easily; in summer horses have to be swum -r, .i * «., . tx across the Gilgit river at Sher Kila, and between Chittorkun and Eemit are two places where the river flows under steep rocks necessitating horses being swum across above and below to get past them. A moderate amount of labour would, however, make these places practicable for horses, and the construction of a bridge at Sher Kila would not be difficult. The Ishkaman river is fordable everywhere for seven months in the year, and the Gilgit river for nearly six months. So great an amount of labour and expense would, however, be needed'to make the road practicable for wheeled transport, especially the part between Gilgit and the mouth of the Karoombur valley, that it is practically of little use for military purposes. 47. From the village of Ishkaman Durkote is reached in two days by a good road. From Asumbul Yassin is reached in one day and Roads between Karoombur valley and Yassin. &amp; ^ ^ from , Dayina in two days. All these roads are practicable for horses, except for two months in winter. The top of the high ground between the Yassin and Karoombur valleys is described as open and undulating, but the ascent to it is steep. 48.

Desire for friendship with British Government. Mention was frequently made to me of our visit to Wakhan in 1874: the presents sent up afterwards to Meer Futteh Ali Shah appearing to have produced a very favourable impression. Being unable to prosecute my journey further towards Surhad, I returned to 8 ^ Gilgit and Cashmere, reaching Srmuggur on the Return to Gilgit and Cashmere. gud October. 49 .[ cxxiv ] 50. The feuds that have been carried on during- the past eight years between the sons . of Gaur Rahman, imve reduced Yassin to a miser- Present state o assm. able state. The poverty of the inhabitants and wretched cultivation in the Karoombur valley were a vivid contrast to the comparative pros perity of Hunza. Matters were made worse by a failure of grain crops in Yassin last year. The districts of Yassin and Mastuch are computed to contain respectively only 1,200 and 2,000 houses, in place of nearly double that number that existed a few years ago. No attempt seems to be made at any regular administration of the country, the peasantry suffer great oppression, and men are sold ruthlessly into slavery for the slightest offence.

I took some pains to ascertain what the general feeling is on this point, and I believe that though the idea of a Hindoo ruler would be somewhat repugnant to Mussulman ideas, the change would be grateful to all except those immediately connected with the present Meer. 52. Peihlowan Bahadoor is described as a rough ignorant man of no education, in this differing from Meer Wulli, who is said to have been a well educated man. He is said to be ambitious, even aiming at the recovery of Gilgit. It is fair to say that none of the atrocities that characterized the rule of Gaur Rahman are related of him. Since Mr. Hayward’s mur der the Meer’s Wuzeer, Rahmat, has been secretly in the pay of the Cashmere Government. 51. The headmen of the Feeling concerning annexation. Peihlowan Bahadoor. 53. At the time of my visit to Expedition against Tangir. Hunza Peihlowan Bahadoor carried out successfully a scheme he had long been planning for ousting his brother Malik Aman from Tangir. Tangir is an independent republic five days* journey to the south of Yassin. The fort is very strong and considered impregnable, and the people of Tangir pride themselves on giving asylum to all who seek it. Malik Aman took refuge there after escaping from Gilgit m 1870; but latterly had made himself disliked by the Tangir people. Leaving Mastuch suddenly Peihlowan Bahadoor advanced by rapid marches, crossing the pass before any opposition could be made, and appeared before the fort which he nearly succeeded in taking by a coup de main. After a few days part of the garrison made terms for themselves, and Malik Aman escaped by night to Patrak. 54. Yassin can furnish now not more than a thousand fighting men, and Mastuch, which also belongs to Peihlowan Khan, about fifteen hundred. Arms are scarce and of had quality, and the local warfare consists in the attack and defence of the numerous mud forts, and the occupation of strong positions at the gorge of passes. The favorite season for an attack on a neighbouring State is in August when the crops are nearly ripe. An invading force can then depend on the standing corn for subsistence, and the stores in an enemy's fort are at their lowest. Warlike power in Yassin. 55. The ruler of Chitral can put eight thousand men into the field; besides these he can Warlike power of Chitral. ' count on numerous allies. The Khans of Dhyr and Asmar, who are connected with Aman-oo- Moolk by marriage, have lately agreed to make common interest with him ; and the people of Shevare, Herbund, Sazeen, and Darel will afford assistance according to the locality and season of year. The Bushgulli tribe of Kaffirs also pay tribute to the Aman-ool-Moolk, and would probably assist him in the field. Mastuch and Yassin are both dependencies of Chitral. 56. Chitral is reached from Yassin through Mastuch, to which there are two roads, Roads to Chitral. of which are closed to the passage of troops in winter. Murder of Slier Afzul. 57. Just before I left Gilgit the news arrived that the Aman-ool-Moolk had procured the murder of his brother Sher Afzul in Patrak, where he had been living for several years.

By choosing a favourable time of year they would find small difficulty in subduing Yassin or Hunza, but the retention of either country, especially of the former, would prove a heavy dram on Cashmere resources. ^ 62. The Gdgit valley contains nearly a thousand houses, a few being added yearly. By Popularity of Cashmere rule. a policy the Maharajahs rule has become ^ x . ... , . exceedingly popular, and the inhabitants contrast their present flourishing condition and immunity from slavery with the state of their neioffi- bours and the recollections of the opposition they suffered under Gaur Rahman. There’ is not a family in the valley that cannot relate the fate of parents or brothers sold into slavery and never again heard of. No revenue is raised by the Cashmere Government, but the people are bound to furnish personal service according to the number of houses. In this way between six and seven hundred men are available for certain duties, such as patrolling roads, guarding certain posts, maintaining beacons ready to be fired as alarm signals, and convoying supplies. Every bouse can boast of a matchlock. 63. The condition of the regular troops in the valley, now about twelve hundred in The supplies for Gilgit and Astor garrisons. number was during the first years of occupation very bad; they were entirely dependent on Cash- mere for supplies, and at times great scarcity prevailed. It took some time to make the people of Gilgit understand that they would get a fair price for the surplus food raised by them. Now the system is well established, and the garrison is fed from the produce of the valley. The garrisonee of Astor, Boonjee, and other posts west of the Indus are still -entirely sustained on rice grown in Cashmere. The carriage of this is a heavy tax on the Cashmere treasury. Cost of occupation. 64. Altogether the occupation of Gilgit entails a yearly cost of from £ 6,000 to £ 8 , 000 . Estimate of the value of the passes. 65. The capabilities of the three passes over the Hindu Kush may be briefly summed up as follows : The Karoombur Pass only open in winter, practically of no importance, but liable from phy sical changes to become important for a time, and therefore to be watched. The Durkote Pass leading direct to Yassin, open for horse and foot traffic for ten months in the year, but permanently impassable for artil lery on account of a glacier that has to be traversed, of secondary importance.

The Baroghil Pass, leading into the Mastuch, Chitral, and Koonnr or Panjkorah valleys practicable for artdlery for ten months m the The Barogbil Pass. y eai ^ p u t closed on the south side by an easily de fensible gorge, of first-rate importance. * For details of the working of the republican institutions, see 33 Drew’s Jummoo and Cashmere.[ cxxvi ] Control of tlie passes. the passes at the mercy of that power. Importance of Sirikol known to Russia. 66 . Of the physical features of the roads from the Earoghil Pass to the Punjab we have only native information, but there is no Nature of the country between the Baroghil Pass reason £ or believing that they present insuperable and the Punjab. obstacles to an invading army; while from inform ation o-ained in Wakhan and on the Pamir in 1874, it is tolerably certain that from Osh in Nature of the country between Khokand and Kkokand to Within thllty-tive miles of Surhad no the Baroghil Pass. road-making whatever is required, and a very trifling amount of labour would make the whole distance practicable for artillery. 67. It will probably be objected that, though an army might march along the route indicated, it could not be supplied with food from Possibility of supplying an mvadmg ai my. ^be countries lying between the Oxus and the Indus. This is no doubt the case, but it must be remembered that the annexation of Kashgar by Russia is an event that is tolerably certain to happen before many years, and the food and carriage resources of Kashgar are practically unlimited, while the Pamir grazing is the finest in the world. 68 . The control of the passes is therefore a matter of considerable importance to India, and the establishment of a Russian garrison at Sirikol would under present circumstances place The importance of Sirikol is well known to Russia. Before the expulsion of the Chinese from Kash gar it is said that an agreement existed for the establishment of a Russian cantonment in Sirikol, which of course came to nothing when the rebellion broke out, and when Baron von Kaulbars visited Kashgar in 1872 permission was demanded to visit Sirikol, which was refused by the Ameer. 69. It would therefore appear advisable to bring the Meer of Yassin under British influence and render the passes secure from the The control o ashin. possibility of a sudden attack. This would have to be done by force of arms, or by negotiation. In the former alternative the most obvious means would be to employ the Maharaja's arms. That he would have little difficulty in Inability of Cashmere to retain Yassin and subduing \assill I have no doubt, but I do Mastuch. not believe that he would be able to maintain himself permanently there, and the Cashnlere officials to whom I have spoken on the subject are of the same-opinion. Still less would he be able to keep possession of Mastuch, without which the retention of Yassin would be of little value. Even supposing the Maharaja's troops to be equal to the task of permanently maintaining themselves in Yassin and Mastuch, the drain on the Cashmere treasury would become greater than it could stand, and a subsidy from the British Government would certainly be demanded. 70. Should the employment of British troops be deemed necessary, a very small force Necessity of its being done by the British would be sufficient. In any case the expense Government. must fall on the British Government, it would therefore appear desirable to keep the management of the expenditure in our own hands. 71. In order to gain the desired result by negotiation, the dealings must be direct „ „ ,. ,. between the British Government and the Yaghes- Possibility of negotiation. ^ tan Chiefs, as nothing but force will induce the ruler of Yassin to acknowledge a Hindoo master, or the ruler of Chitral to forego his here ditary lordship over two provinces. A yearly payment of money might reconcile both Chiefs to declaring themselves feudatories of the British Government, but from a military point of view that alone, unless accompanied by a substantial guarantee, would be of no great advantage, wdiile the notorious faithlessness of the Dards presents obvious disadvantages to the scheme. 72. The only alternative then thatpresents itself is to make such arrangements as to Alternative scheme. s “ ure the command of the passes by a military force at short notice. This may be done by a secret understanding with the Maharaja, the strengthening of the force stationed at Gilgit by the supply of good arms, and the establishment of a British officer permanently at Gilgit.

SHAW, POLITICAL AGENT, LATE ON SPECIAL DUTY AT KASHGAR, DATED CALCUTTA, 10th APRIL 1876, ON THE PRESENT CONDI TION OP APFAIRS IN EASTERN TURKESTAN. A very brief sketch of the antecedents of the kingdom of Eastern Turkestan may perhaps be not out of place before an account of the present state of affairs in that country. 2. Kashgaria formed part of the heritage of Chaghatai, son of Chengiz Khan. One branch of his family, under the title of Khans of Moghulistan, ruled over what is now Kash- garia as well as over the waste and the mountainous region to the north of it, at present in the possession of Russia. Before the time of the Mongol conquest, Kashgaria had become partially converted to Islam, and the descendants of Chaghatai adopted that faith. 3. Towards the end of the 16th century the country seems to have become split up into little principalities governed by members of the Imperial family. By the middle of the 17th century the power of these petty princes gradually lapsed into the hands of the spiritual Chiefs, called “Khoja,” members of a saintly family which had come over from Western Turkestan, and caused a kind of religious revival about half a century before in Kashgaria. This family soon split up into two rival branches, called respectively after the “White Mountain” and the “Black Mountain,” and the feuds between their respective factions finally destroyed the independence of the country. The Chief of the “ White Mountain” branch being expelled from Kashgaria, called in the assistance of the Buddhist Kalmaks or Eleuths of Zungaria, by whose help he was placed in possession of Eastern Turkestan, but at the cost of holding it as a tributary under the Kaimak Chiefs. When, in the middle of the 18th century, the Zungar (Kal- mak) kingdom was attacked by the Chinese, an attempt was_marie by the reigning Khojas of Kashgar to recover their independence during the confusion. But the Chinese having triumphed over their Kaimak enemies by allying themselves with one of the native pretenders, resorted to a similar course in order to obtain possession of Kashgaria. Finding in exi e among the Kalmaks of Ha a Kashgar Khoja belonging to the faction opposed to those who bad rebelled, they sent him westward with a small force. Being joined as they advanced by all his adherents in the country, they soon overpowered the resistance of the remainder of the population and took possession of Kashgaria. The Chinese, having obtained this footing m the country, soon disposed of their tool the titular Khoja not however without suffering and inflicting severe losses. Since then they have garrisoned the country and governed it through Native Chiefs, notwithstanding repeated risings, up to 1863. 4 The geographical position and the history of the Eastern Turkestan has had a peculiar effect' on their character. Cut off from the rest of the mountains, and thrown into contact with non-Mussulman nations on tlie ^ ast Af T p e been verv orthodox They have required repeated “revivals” to warm their ^ith. ihe missionaries from the W r est who have from time to time come amongst them have met with “c e s but £ the course of a generation or two the feeling thus exci ed changed m o a personal devotion to the descendants of their teachers. . ^ narrowed, so also did its influence. _ The nationa le igion e a . i indifferent to of devoted and fanatical disciples, while the mass o ie peop Mahomedan • and they religious distinctions.

The presence of the reli fl rencf hlT f aUer! off; although as four generations during the rule of the Ch , i ona i and religious feelings of the long as they seemed the only representatives a o-ainst their foreign masters nation, it was sufficient to make their disciples ever ready to use against at the call of their Khojas. -i a 4 -u . .p 6 . But these futile attempts have caused much suffiemig^tOoth^ their sentatives of the saintly family have s ^ ow11 'j,™ (Mussulman) Tungani troops in the service followers. When the rebellion and mutiny 0 ; _ ( . ndard 0 f the Khojas, one of them, of China offered an opportunity for again raising j y p 0 p an d to recover the former by name Duzurg Khan, came forth from his p ace ' , 0 fg cer 0 f note (the present Ameer heritage of his family. He was accompanie ya reg . re t the reins of government Takoob Khan), and the people of Kashgana fall from the incapable hands of the Chief into those of his Lieutenan 337. But for Yakoob Khan, this expedition would have. been another of the disastrous failures of the Khojas, for among- the warring factions which were contending for the rule after the destruction of the Chinese, their's was not the strongest. With the help however of several bodies of Khokand warriors who were fleeing before the Hussian conquests, and who arrived on the scene at a critical moment, but chiefly by his own genius, Yakoob Khan snatched the prize from the hands of contending parties, each stronger at first than he was; and has now firmly established his rule over a region which has never been in one Mussulman hand since the days of the successors of Chengiz Khan. 8 . The kingdom thus formed is not an agglomeration of dissimilar provinces joined together by the chances of conquest, but a single country both by geographical position and by oneness of race. The people are, so far as one can judge, content to be ruled by one of their own religion and language, though born beyond their borders. It is true they are getting over their first delight at their release from an alien rule and from the destructive wars which followed its overthrow. The wild dreams of future happiness that precede a revolution have passed away, and they are beginning to realize sadly that no Government can be carried on without taxation, and no oriental Government without petty tyranny and malversations on the part of subordinate officials. Undoubtedly also fear forms a considerable element in their feeling with regard to the Ameer, but this is not always in the East a cause of unpopularity or dislike. His religious strictness too is above the standard of the mass of the people. But of any deliberate discontent on their part, or preference for another rule, I have seen no signs. The Government is undoubtedly less corrupt and oppressive than that of most other Eastern kingdoms. The villagers have an influential voice in the selection of their own officials and headmen. The district officials selected by the Government are kept under close supervision. In fact between the difficulty and danger of collecting more than the lawful amount, and the strict account that is required of them, they have about the hardest task of any, and do not eventually obtain much profit from their offices. 9. The system of administration resembles that of the ancient Persian satraps. The Governors of provinces both raise and command their own troops, but the appointment of the principal officers is kept in the hands of the Ameer. Each local officer or subordinate has to defray all local expenses, even the cost of the troops in his district, out of local revenue. This consists chiefly of the collections in kind (not in money) drawn from the landholders and the merchants. Out of the balance he has to meet the orders which are granted by his superiors in favor of their officers and soldiers, who are maintained by these orders. As the amounts collected are very closely calculated by the superiors next in grade and drawn upon freely, the local officer finds it rather difficult to put together out of the remainder the annual tribute or “ tartuk ” which he is expected to pay to his immediate civil superior, and to save anything for himself besides. Each district or provincial Chief in his turn is thus drawn upon by the officer next above him, while the sum of the tributes or “ turtuks ” finds its way at the end of the year into the Ameer’s treasury in Kashgar, the merit of a Governor being con sidered very much in proportion to the amount of his tribute ; while a rough check on extortion is afforded by the readiness with which complaints are listened to, and the boldness of the peasantry in making them. Of course, however, this check is insufficient in the more remote districts. It is said that the Dadkhwah of Yarkund being asked some years ago by the Ameer, why his tribute was less than that of Khotan, replied—“The Governor of Khoinn fears one person; I fear seven. He is afraid only of Your Highness; whilst I fear, first God, next the Prophet, then the four friends (the four first Khalifs) and afterwards Your Highness.” This explanation was favorably received; but the Governor of Khotan continues in office. 10. Each Governor in presenting his tribute receives valuable gifts in return; but there is no fixed salary attached to his office. In the same way the army is paid by orders for food on the local Government granaries (more than sufficient to maintain the men and their fami lies) ; and besides this they get periodical presents, but no fixed pay. But with the exception of the body-guard all other soldiers are allowed to attend to their own business during the greater part of the day, so they are not badly off. No unremunerated labour is exacted from any member of the community, as is the custom of Native States even in India. Even the Chinese captives are paid at market rates when engaged on public works, and at other times receive a subsistence allowance. 11. The country enjoys perfect internal order. It may with truth be said that the roads are as safe as in India under our Government. Highway robberies are absolutely un known. Rich caravans move about with perfect security, and an armed man is never seen in town or country with the exception of soldiers on duty. 12 . M hile the Ameer’s treasuries are pretty well replenished with material wealth, suffi cient for his immediate wants, there is a great scarcity of money. It is this which prevents his maintaining a much larger army than he does, for he could command the services of an immense number of restless spirits from AV estern Turkestan whose career is cut off by the Russian annexations, could he only afford to pay them in peace time. As it is, he maintains a considerable body of troops whom he trains and disciplines after the European fashion, and who would probably prove a formidable nucleus which, after a few months of war, would be largely increased. The best part of his troops together with his most trusted officers are his own fellow-countrymen from Khokand, who are known under the name of Andijanis.[ cxxxi ] 13.

The result of this first unofficial visit was the despatch of an Envoy to India by the Ameeimn the winter of 1869-70 in order to test tl e truth of my statements regarding the friendly disposition of the English With him, during the next summer, a party of English officers was sent back to Eastern Turkestan under the command of Sir D Forsyth oAhis party I was a member. During the Envoy's absence in India a war had broken out on the extreme east of the Ameer s dominions where the Tunganis had been making incursions on his frontier.^ The Envoy received news of this orf the way up, but knowing that the journey of the British mission would be stopped if perfect peace were not supposed to be reffinina- in the country to which they were proceeding, he deceitfully concealed the intellffienJe which had reached him. On arriving in Yarkund territory we found out the true state of the case • and although the war that had broken out was purely a foreign one, yet our orders beino- not to proceed on our expedition if any disturbances were taking place, Sir D. Forsyth decided on returning at once, notwithstanding the efforts made by the Governor of Yarkund to detain us until communications could be received from the Ameer, who was then more than 1,000 miles away in command of his army. We only stayed twelve days in the town of Yarkund and then returned to India. Our upward journey had been marked \v disasters to our baggage animals caused by the absolute failure of the provisions undertaken to be sent with us by 'the Cash- mere Government. It was only at the sacrifice of the lives of nearly 200 baggage animals (compelling us to leave a great part of our camp behind), and by putting all our men on short commons, that we had succeeded in reaching Yarkund territory, where provisions in plenty met us. Before our return, the Governor of Ladakh (under the Cashmere Maharaja), the person responsible for the detention of our supplies, had been removed from his post in consequence of the remonstrances of the Government of India, and our return journey by a new and experi mental route was performed as successfully as those of the ordinary caravans of merchants. 15. The anxiety of the Ruler of Kashgar to establish friendly communications with the British Government led him, on his return from his successful Eastern campaign, to send down another Envoy of higher rank and character, in the winter of 1871-72. The lamented death of Lord Mayo occurring at this time the Envoy returned without effecting much, before the arrival of Lord Northbrook in the country. But the next winter another Envoy, a relative and namesake of the Ameer's, and a man with some experience of western politics, obtained during a previous residence at Constantinople, was sent down to India. After arranging for the return of a British mission with him in the ensuing summer, he employed the interval in a journey to Constantinople, where, in the name of the Ameer, he placed the new kingdom of Kashgaria under the suzerainty of the Porte. 16. At the time when this Envoy was coming down to India, several of the English Cambers of Commerce drew the attention of Government to the opening for trade afforded by the establishment of a friendly and peaceable power in Central Asia. Accordingly the mission which was now sent up under Sir D. Forsyth was instructed to negotiate a Commercial Treaty with the Ameer of Kashgar. This Treaty was signed on the 2nd February 1874. It estab lished freedom of trade subject to a low import duty in the Ameers dominions; and secured a fair trial for all cases arising between British subjects and others, by providing that the British Representative should be present at the hearing of the cases or should himself dispose of them. The right of the British Government to appoint a Representative to reside at the Ameer's Court was recognized, and vice versa. 17. I had the honor of being selected for this post* and I was instructed also to take * Foreign Department xNo. 1152P., dated 29th up His Excellency the Viceroy's ratification of the May 1876. Treaty, but the delivery of my credentials was to depend on circumstances. Accordingly in writing up to Yakoob Khan, the formei Envoy * HATafterwards murdered during an expedition through an independent Hill State on the north-west of the Cashmere dominions. t From Under-Seeretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, No. 1523, dated 18th October 1869.[ cxxxii ] (with whom I had been instructed to place myself in communication), I merely mentioned that I was bringing up the ratification. The Envoy in reply sent me a letter which met me en route in which he said that he was awaiting my arrival m Kashgar previous to starting on another mission to India and Constantinople, when we might travel back together. On my meetino- him in due course in Yarkund, he withdrew his suggestion tor my return with him, and proposed in the Ameer's name that I should stay on in the country for the present. He moreover told me that as the Ameer was now a vassal of the Porte, it was fitting that the Sultan's sanction should be obtained to the Treaty just concluded with the British Government, and suggested that on this being reported to the Ameer by himself, either by letter or in person on his return, the arrangements for my permanent stay in the country should be completed. 18 When all these matters were reported to Government, I received in due course instructions to return to India in the spring, unless I were pressed by the Ameer to stay on. 19 Previous to this, however, the business regarding the Treaty had to be accomplished. * Foreign Department No. S88P., dated 16th The instructions * forwarded with the ratification April 1874, Sections 3 &amp; 8. to Sir D. Forsyth, and which had been handed over with it to me, directed that the ratification of His Excellency the Viceroy should be exchanged &lt;f for a document of a similar purport on the part of His Highness the Ameer.' In presenting His Excellency's ratification to the Ameer in October 1874, I accordingly requested His Highness to furnish me with his own in return. 20. On one or two subsequent occasions when I reminded the Hadkbwah of Yarkund of my wish for the Ameer's ratification, he each time brought up the question of a permanent Resident as if that were the only point remaining to be arranged. In fact it seemed that they considered the Treaty completed (as far as its written formalities went) when His Excellency the Viceroy's ratification was delivered ; but the carrying into effect of its provisions by the definitive establishment of a British Resident, they wished to defer until the formal sanction of the Sultan should be received. They showed plainly that they did not desire that I should leave the country pending the receipt of this sanction, but only that no formal arrangement should be completed for my permanent stay till then. 21. Meanwhile the Ameer treated us with great cordiality, assuring me personally of his pleasure at seeing me again; and during our stay in the country there were scarcely any symptoms of that a under-current of mistrust' (see a Rawlinson's England and Russia, p. 337, 1st Ed.') which had been remarked by the previous mission, nor of the restrictions which had’attended our first visits to the country. We were welcomed, and even urged, to go about and see as much as we liked of the country. Passports to visit Aksu, Khotan, &amp;c. (which were practically refused before, see No. 153, dated 16th March 1874, from Sir D. Forsyth, paragraph 43) were granted without difficulty on my application on behalf of the European Manager of the Central Asia Trade Company and his Assistant. With hardly a single excep tion every suggestion or request that I made was adopted. In une matter however I did not succeed in carrying my point. Some Indian artificers had gone up in 1870 to take service in the Ameer's workshops. They now wished to return to India, and I was led to believe that no objection would be raised. At the last moment, however, just before my own departure, an excuse was made that as some of the men were employed in distant parts of the country it would be best to collect them all together, and a promise was made to send them down shortly. This promise has not yet been carried out. 22. In other respects my wishes met with every attention. For many years past the caravans of traders bound for India had been annually detained waiting for passports, until so late each season that they were exposed to considerable hardships and losses. At my request last year passes were granted to all British subjects at once on application, so that many started as early as Aprii. Former restrictions on patients coming for medical advice were removed, and some 29,000 attendances of about 9,000 individual patients were registered by Dr. Scully in six or seven months. On our hiring a house in the city for a dispensary, we found out that the owner of the house had incurred the resentment of the authorities by let ting it to us. On my expressing to them my determination to give it up unless our occupation of it was cordially approved of by both authorities and townspeople, explanations were at once offered. The whole thing was declared to be a mistake, and we were so urgently invited to carry out our plans, that I had no longer any hesitation in doing so. Dr. Scully's operations and ministrations were attended with marked success in increasing the' cordiality of our rela tions with small and great. Never during our whole stay did we see a scowling face turned on us, excepting that of a Cashmeri now and then. The religious leaders were as friendly as the rest of the population and officials. Dr. Scully daily took long rides in the pursuit of his / taste for ornithology and botany. He was always unattended, except by his own syce (having made the authorities understand that he did not wish to trouble them for an escort of any sort). He never met with the slightest incivility, but whether far or near from the city, the villagers would aid him in his occupation, inviting him into their houses, and frequently detaining him for a while in order that they might offer him hospitality. 23. During excursions which I myself made (attended by official “ Mihmandars' selected by myself) I met with a most friendly reception everywhere, and the only difficulty I experienced was in getting my kind entertainers (often private individuals) to accept any34 would go next, while would be a little and enter into con- given us, autumn.

At last the time arrived for us to start on our return journey, according to instruc t,ons, it we were not going to remam m the country. No hint to depart had been on the contrary plans were talked of for our amusement in the summer and received a letter from the Envoy, Yakoob Khan, written after his arrival told me that my permanent residence in Kashgar had been arranged and happiness there * But as no instructions of the kind from Government carried out my former orders. The Dadkhwah of Yarkund (where I was then staviim I asked him to procure for me from the Ameer His Highness* ratification to the 7 ' had uo| yet reached me, replied by a question as to whether I did not by post. 25. On my informing him furthev that I was about to return to India, he repeatedly pressed me to tell him, as a friend, what course would be most agreeable to the British Gov eminent, saying that the Ameer wished to be guided in this matter entirely by its wishes' Would the \iceroy prefer that I should become the permanent Resident at once; or would it be best to wait until the sanction of the Sultan, the suzerain of the country, should be received? As my instructions were to let the initiative come from the Ameer, I replied that my orders referred only to the ratification of the Treaty. The Dadkhwah/ always comiim- back to the question of Residents, expressed his opinion that it was by the exchange of representatives that his country could hope to reap the advantages of our friendship, which is like fertilizing water, of no use to those who do not turn it into their fields. In reply to a farther application on my part, he begged me to defer all preparations for my departure until he had paid his annual visit to the Ameer, which he was about to do shortly. 26. They had now pointedly put it on record, as it were, that no objection to our con tinued stay in the country was offered by the Ameer’s Government. They had moreover ascertained that I made no demand to be recognized as permanent Resident; but that, on the contrary, the initiative of our departure came from us. They did not press me to break through what they understood were my instructions (to return); but they showed in every way their readiness to accede to the wishes of the British Government in the matter of a representa tive. Of course it is possible that they might not have shown this readiness if they had not guessed that I was not instructed to take advantage of it; but of this there is no proof, and it is difficult to see how they can have known what my instructions were before the matter came to a point. 27. On the Dadkhwall’s return from Kashgar, and on my again pressing my wish to depart, it was acceded to, and I was assisted in the most liberal manner in my preparations. (Here I may mention that I had not been able to avoid accepting from the Ameer during the whole period of our stay the daily provisions for our whole party, and on our return journey we were provisioned at his expense to within two marches of the Karakoram Pass.) Even after our journey was determined on, they put it off for nearly a mouth (perhaps in the expectation of hearing from the Envoy, Yakoob Khan, news of whom from Constantinople might have been looked for at that time). Many regrets were expressed by high officials at our not staying on, as they had expected me to be with them for several years, they said. 28. I have gone into details on this subject because they will correct an idea broached in some quarters, that the Ameer had shown an unfriendly wish to get rid of us. This idea seems to have originated from the mere fact of our return. No imputation of unfriendliness can, I think, be fairly fixed upon him, on the ground of his not pushing his desire for perman ent diplomatic intercourse with us, further than that expressed by the British Government itself. 29. Just before leaving Yarkund I received from the Ameer a closed document for presentation to His Excellency the Viceroy, and I was given to understand that it was the document which I was awaiting, viz., His Highness the Ameer’s ratification. As tie iea 7 already purported to have been confirmed by the Ameer at. the time of execution, I did not consider it necessary to raise difficulties about accepting this closed missive, or. o t ay my departure any further by insisting on being furnished with a separate document in the precise form desired. Oriental princes are impatient of the technicalities o moio cmizic na ions, and suspicious of formalities of which they do not see the exact purpose. now appeals (from Sir D.

The Ameer’s seal originally impressed on the Treaty beneath the confirmatory clause will, however, probably be considered sufficiently binding. 30. Having traced the rise of the new kingdom of Kashgaria and the progress of its intercourse with British India, I now turn to its other foreign reLiti ms. In considering these one is struck by the great variety of races and governments with which the newly-founded State has to deal. In the east, the time-worn Empire of China, which would seem capable of crushing all opposition by the vast numbers of its people could they but unite their strength with fitting organization for purposes of aggression ; in the west, the turbulent Afghans in their dependency of Badakshan ; on the north, the ever advancing Russians ; and on 'the south the consolidated British Indian Empire. These larger States however form an outer circle, the space between which and the borders of Kashgaria is padded, as it were, by a covering mass of tribes and small States which preserve that country at present from the dangers or inconveniences of immediate contact with its powerful neighbours. In places this padding has been worn out very thin by the outside pressure, but the geographical features of the region still prevent this pressure from being felt in the interior. 31. The vast belt of mountains which almost surround the country forms a huge bay like a U lying on its side with its open mouth towards the east. It is an almost absolutely rainless region. These mountains debar all access to the clouds in three directions, while the enormous distance from the sea on the east acts in the same manner on that side. Hence cul tivation is possible only by means of an elaborate system of irrigation by canals taken from the rivers, which themselves derive their waters from the melting of the glaciers on the high bounding ranges. The extent to which cultivation is nevertheless carried shows the industrious character of the people, while this condition splits up the inhabited country into a number of larger or smaller districts or little States, strung on to the courses of the rivers, generally not far from the foot of the mountains, and separated from one another by tracts of desert. These little States are the “jewels set in sand” of the Oriental poet, and their rich verdure and shady groves form the most striking contrast to the glaring deserts by which they are approached. 32. The north-eastern termination of the mountain belt is separated from the opposite portion of the southern range by a broad space which is partly occupied by long spurs of mountain from the south, leaving an opening in the north-east corner where the sands of the great Mongolian desert sweep in and mingle with those of the Takla-Makan waste, where legends of cities buried under the moving sands have formed a nucleus round which all tales of the marvellous current in those regions have collected and found a local habitation. In the almost unknown mountains and steppes, which half close up the eastern entrance to the great Kashgarian bay, are situated the head-waters of the Yellow River (Hoang-Ho) which issues into the plains of China not far west of Lanju, the capital of the province of Kansu, the scene of disturbance for so many years past. 33. In the mountains on the south bank of the Yellow River, in the district called Salar, dwells a curious Turki-speaking race of Mussulmans, separated from all their kindred, but forming as it were a nucleus of resistance against the Imperial arms for their Chinese co-reli gionists who are known to us under the name of Tungani or Dungen. While the Imperial arms seem to have recovered their ascendancy (for a while at least) in the plains of Western China, these Hill Mussulmans it would appear have remained unassailed in their stronghold. But of this region, where the problem of China’s renewed power of interference in the affairs of more westerly nations seems about to solve itself one way or the other, we have no definite intelligence, though some Russian travellers have lately passed without difficulty through a corner of it. 34. Recent rumours speak of renewed attacks made by the Mussulmans of this mountain region on the Imperial troops in Western Kansu, in revenge for massacres of their co-reli gionists. But the result of the previous successes (in 1872 and 1873) of the Chinese had been the migration of large bodies of TuUganis to the north-westward, across the desert which occupies the mouth of the great Kashgarian plateau. These bodies of immigrants have re inforced their fellow-tribesmen established on the northern skirts of the celestial mountains about Urumchi and Manas, who were already in sufficient force to harass seriously the isolated Chinese garrisons left in the west of Mongolia, and to compel the Ameer of Kashgar (to whom Urumchi and Manas belong) to treat these outlying provinces of his kingdom almost on the footing of equals. Separated now from China by vast deserts, and having the moral, if not material, support of sympathising co-religionists at their back, these Tungani colonies seem to be defying their late masters and more recent enemies the Chinese. A late attempt on the part of the latter to re-establish permanent communications across the Gobi desert with their outlying garrison of Kumul (Hami) seems to have failed, and the flood of Tungani rebeldom to be again surging round its walls. 35. This swarm of rebellious Mussulmans situated some on the south and some on the north of the Great Desert, is the first of those tribes which have been spoken of as forming a defensive padding between Kashgaria and the great powers which surround it.[ cxxxv ] 36. Under present circumstances therefore an attempt on the part of Phi™ f. Kashgana does not seem to have much probability of success before it. A t “ll a my eTen if secure of its base of operations in Kansu, would be unequal to tho even could not be fed m the desolated regions that lie between 1 The Ameer hhoJ?/ ar8 ' e 1 ° ne that the advance of a Chinese army was rendered entirely impossible at present by t^Xt™ the country beyond his own borders wh.ch has been entirely laid waste by the Tunganis This is borne out by reports from the Rnss,an side, m one of which we read The chief imoed meat m the way of the Chinese ,s the difficulty of marching their troops. . . The rebellion ht left ,,, the hands of the Chinese a now perfectly mined and desolated country, which, accordin' to the official report of the Governor-General of the Western Provinces, is not alone incapable of afford,ng any supphes to a marching army, but is itself in need of Government aid.” [Secret and Political Department, India Office, No. CVL, 1874] 37. It would be necessary to uproot the Tunganis and to form cultivated districts in the deserts which are now their home before China would have a base to act from. The distance is too great for her to stretch across from Kansu and strike an effective blow at K ash oar without first forming an intermediate rallying place and source of supplies. Her system of warfare requires her to pour in a continuous succession of troops arriving fresh day after day upon the scene of action until resistance fails before the repeated blows. The regularity of such a stream could not be secured at the end of such a long line of communications-and once interrupted, her troops would be liable to destruction in detail. When the Chinese con- quered Kashgaria in the last century, Ila (Kulja) was their base and the Kalrnaks were their allies, as also a large section of the people of Kashgar, the followers of a religious Chief whose cause the Chinese, for their own purposes, espoused. The people of Eastern 0 Turkestan were divided against themselves and had been engaged in civil wars for years past. Such circumstances are not likely to recur. The war of sects has died out. The whole resources of the country are in the hands of an energetic Prince whose successes have given him great prestige. Kulja is in the hands of the Russians, and would form no secondary base of oper ations for China. The Kalmaks are no longer her subjects or allies. 38. At the present day a Chinese army, after establishing a base in the Tungani country, or say in the Kumul or Turf an district (the former of which lies waste, and the latter is so little productive that the Ameer of Kashgar has assigned to its Governor, for his personal sup plies and those of his troops, the two districts of Bai and Sairam in the fertile region further west), would after tins have before it a long march of some 1,000 miles along a narrow strip of cultivated country, hemmed in by the mountains on the north and by the desert on the south. This nature of the country, instead of being a protection to the flanks of an invading army, would afford rallying grounds the best suited to the operations of its enemies, the moun tain Kirghiz on one side and the irregular Turk! horsemen of the Ameer on the other. Against such difficulties a Chinese army, as described by Captain Prshevalski (who saw the very troops who would be the first engaged in this service), is not very fitted to contend. He writes:— “Their common arms are matchlocks and swords; a few have English smooth-bore guns. . , . some double-barrelled English pistols. . . . some such of Tula manufacture, but very insignificant quantities of either. The cavalry and a small number of the infantry as well are armed with bamboo pikes. . . . As regards the moral standard of the Chinese soldiery. . . ., an European has great difficulty in believing in the possibility of such an army, least of all on the theatre of war. . . . The constant use of opium unfits the armies of China for the performance of the most important duty of a soldier, that of keeping a proper watch, and this in itself makes them an easy prey to every bold and active enemy. . . . The same cause renders them incom petent for the least physical exertion. A shower of rain is sufficient to drive these effeminate creatures, who call themselves warriors, from the open outworks of a fort; and to abandon the trenches of a night is the usual thing, unless they are deterred by the fear.of capital punish ment. . . . Desertion is rife to such an extent that some commanders have but a few hundreds of men left from as many thousands. . . . The demoralization of the troops is visibly increasing from year to year. But the all predominant characteristic of the Chinese soldier or oui da)s is his cowardice, the inborn vice of the whole nation.” 39. It is strange if the active and warlike Chief of a consolidated nation, aided by his geographical position, cannot defend himself against such an army as is above described; unless the overwhelming numbers which the Chinese Government has at its disposa s iou c e ou &amp; i capable of reversing every natural advantage on the other side. But t le piesen circums ances of the country would scarcely allow of a gigantic effort being mat e oi a compaia ive y um ™ portant object, while vast numbers would be rather an impediment than otherwise in an expedi tion through a region where supplies are so deficient. ♦ 40. We now come to the northern frontier of the kingdom of K ash gam. This frontier is entirely mountainous and consists of a series of overlapping eas -wes nt » J nearlv by high ground and arranged in echelon, the general directum of the ^ire cham be^ nearly north-east and south-west. The country to the north o i. is a ! ’ 0 ™ ‘ , • - s packed siderable distance back, with the exception of the eastern poi ion w . „ w hole of by the steppes now occupied by the Tunganis. Russia is now in po . £ roads this mountainous region, and is developing communications there by the construction[ cxxxvi ] and bridges. She now commands a route (that via Ila or Kulja) practicable for wheeled carriages at the back of the mountains, into the plains of Mongolia and Western China. This and not that via Kashgar, is her directest and easiest route to China. 41. Between her territories and those of the Ameer of Kashgar the passes are few and difficult. Above Aksu lies the glacier Pass of Muzart, which is said to require the constant services of 40 men in roughing the ice to keep it practicable for horses. Immediately north of Kashgar there is a deep trench in the mountains occupied by the River Naryn running westwards into the Jaxartes in the Khanate of Khokand. For some years past Russia has been in possession of the upper valley of the Naryn River, but her only means of communica tion with it was from the north, where she has an outlying settlement at Vernoj (Almaty) at the northern foot of the mountains. Last year, however, after the first outbreak in Khokand, she annexed from the west all the northern side of the valley of the Jaxartes up to the em bouchure of the Naryn, together with the valley of that river, so that in accordance with the course she has hitherto followed she obtained direct lateral communications between her most advanced posts in this direction. Her annexation of the rest of Khokand has now given her also command of the western route into Kashgaria, that over the Terek Pass. 42. An army on the defensive at Kashgar would possess the inner and shorter lines of intercommunication, for the mouths of all the passes towards Kashgaria are much nearer together than the entrances to them from the north and west; and they are well fortified against attack, it would thus be in a similar position to that of the Austrian army in Bohemia in 1866 on the eve of the Prussian attack. But of course the superiority of Russia to any native foe is incomparably greater than that which the Prussian army possessed over the Austrian, which it defeated; and although an European force in occupation of Kashgar might hope to defy an attempt at invasion from the north and west, yet the utmost that can be said of any resistance that could be offered by a Native army on this frontier is that it would compel Russia to use more exertions than her advance over the plains of Western Turkestan has cost her. 43. It seems, however, to be the Ameer of Kashgaris aim at present to prevent any cause of hostility from arising between himself and his powerful northern neighbour. While fully alive to his danger from her, he does not allow panic to deprive him of his head. He put aside, in a manner that could give no offence, the early attempts of the Russians to influence him through their submissive ally and his former master, the Khan of Khokand. He pleaded for the honor of a direct communication from the Russian Govern or-General if there were any commands for him; and as in fact the Russians were anxious to open communica tions with him, he managed that the first advance should come from, them, and that it should amount to a recognition of his independence from Khokand. 44. Two years ago a complaint was made by a Russian merchant who had been to Kashgar, that his goods had been taken by a subordinate official at less than their proper value. The Ameer, while protesting against the justice of the claim for damages, paid the amount of it in cash to the authorities at Tashkend. In a letter to me, His Highness called this a “fine” levied on him by Russia, and put it down (though evidently with some soreness) to his ignorance of the commercial customs of the west. Referring to the venture sent up that year to his country by the Central Asian Trade Company from India, he asked me to assist him with my advice lest he should in like manner offend against our trading customs. Of late, however, the Russian merchants who have visited his territory have returned full of praises of his justice and even liberality. His disposition towards our own merchants is evidenced by his having given loans of money to assist Mr. Russell (Manager o! the Central Asian Trade Company) on his arrival in Yarkund, and by his subsequently refunding of his own accord the whole of the customs dues which had been paid bv the Company.* The suspicion entertained by Mr. Russell that underhand influence was being used to prevent the sale of his goods is dis pelled in the eyes of all dispassionate observers by the knowledge of the very excessive prices which were being asked for those goods, a quite sufficient reason to account for their not selling quickly. The Russian authorities seem to have a suspicion that their own merchants may try to “ exploiter” the readiness of the Ameer to give redress when claims for damages are pressed upon him by his neighbours; for at the Russian frontier customs stations, the invoices of goods exported to Kashgar are now carefully verified by search, to ascertain that the whole amount specified has really passed out of Russian territory. 45. The following is an extract from the Goloss of the 28th November 1874“During the first few days” (of the merchant Morosoff^s stay in Kashgar) “the sales were of a very trifling amount, and the purchasers insisted on being given receipts, alleging that the mer chant Somoff, whose case is still the subject of negotiation” (since settled by payment from the Ameer) “ had asked for payment twice over .... It was only after the authorities had publicly announced that the Alorosoff caravan was in no way connected with that of Somoff that trade became brisk .... They soon sold all their cotton stuffs and woollen cloths, but * the Assistant Manager of the Central Asian Trade Company, a young Englishman of the name of Dulgleish, is still in Yarkund, treated in the most hospitable manner, according to liis last letters.[ cxxxvii ] they found no buyers for their nankeens and linen whereunnn „ (the Ameer) “should himself buy the latter for the use of hi7r 1 Yakoob Be ^ 3 could not be made to see the expediency of this measure but the ^ B( * iff at hrst the prestige of their country was great, so he consented aUast 1 ^ n ^ rcl ;f nts wei ‘® Passing, and (from the frontier) “that they had made a mistake a .« in Vi ' ^ fbeir sending a message' longcloth, and that they had lost 500 roubles by the transaction ^ ^ na . nkeens and sen! back to them.' This plan, adopted byLme mercWs of dk 'T wa f, lmm ^-tely their country has perhaps something to say to the inability of Central° U A ting ^ prestl ^ e of appreciate the advantages of European commerce. 7 Asi£m Sovere] g a s to 46. While interference with trade, that fertile somv*P nf . is being thus avoided by the Ameer, violations of the Russian ;ii,d 'othi'T'lV 81 y N “ tlVC Sta i* s guarded against. In Khokand the weakness of the central power has been unablcTto meve R outburs s of fanaticism and onslaughts on Russian territory across the. invisible frontier inf But nature has provided a far more substautial boundary to the Kashgar territory aud here again a padding of tribes prevents immediate contact. y e « The Kirghiz nomads inhabit the mountains from above Aksu round to the Saniu Pass, and, in the northern and north-western section, where Russia is conterminous win, 3 gana, occupy either side of the frontier. This has its dangers (in the way of rival claims on pasture grounds) as well as its advantages. But the Kirghiz, among themselves act nnon the principle that “hawks should not pick out hawks’ eyes,” and their periodical mi,.rations from pasture to pasture are carried on by time-honoured rules, under the direction and arbitra tionof their elders. At any rate the chance of hostile incursions from Kashgar Proper into Russian territory (even if probable otherwise) is minimized by the interposition of a difficult mountain region held by tribes having different interests from the inhabitants of the plains and who are more bound together by their common traditions than divided by their -difference of allegiance. The Kirghiz subject to Kashgar have been converted into a sort of frontier guard by the Ameer, who holds a tight hand over them, while binding them to his service by gifts and favors. _ Their principal Chiefs live a great part of the year at Kashgar, where their treatment at least is not so much that of hostages for the good behaviour of their tribes as of high officials summoned to the capital for consultation on local affairs, and residing there' in the enjoyment of the Ruler's favors. 48. Nor does the Ameer permit his frontier to become a refuse for evil-doers or a rally ing point for bandits. Fugitives from neighbouring States are always “interred.' Even on the western frontier some Afghan merchants, who were robbed last year in crossing the Pamir by a band of Kirghiz, were overtaken in Wakhan by a messenger from the Ameer's frontier officer, who informed them that their mishap having been reported, the Kirghiz had been tracked out and compelled to disgorge, and bade them return at once and take over their goods. 49. An interesting question will soon arise as to the measures which will be taken by Russia to prevent a recurrence of the troubles in Khokand now that she has annexed it. The prime movers in all these disturbances have been the Kipchacks and the Kirghiz of the Alai plain. This plain lies to the south of Khokand separated from it by a range of mountains, and forms part of the Pamir plateau. The Pamirs are high-lying valleys or steppes running roughly east and west, and the Alai plain is only the most northerly of the series. To the westward the Alai deepens and narrows into a gorge which is the hill district of Karategin. This is with difficulty accessible from the west, where Russian officers from Samarkand have lately been surveying its Approaches. From one direction or the other, however, it is probable that Russia may before long seek to control this nursery of troubles, the Alai. Between this point and the easy passes which lead over into the Indus basin, there is only a series of elevated grassy steppes (Pamirs). Colonel Gordon describes them as covered with grass, and says that the hills on their surface are low and rounded with great openings and depressions appearing everywhere. Referring to these openings, one of his guides said—“ Ihere are paths all over the Pamir. It has a thousand roads. With a guide you can go in all directions. From the Great Kara-kul (Lake) just south of the Alai, to the Indus watershed, there is a continuous open valley round behind the head-waters of the Oxus. The word “Pamir is moreover ex plained to mean “ a place depopulated, abandoned, waste, yet capable of habrtatroir, and rn fact the Kirghiz formerly lived there, though now driven away by political causes. 50. To the south bf the easy passes over the Indus watershed are the heads of several long valleys leading down towards the Indus (Mastuj, Chitral, Yassin, Ishkaman, &amp;c.,) and inhabited by petty independent tribes. W r e know but little of what goes on there. English travellers are not often able to visit the Gilgit valley, our tributary the Maharaja of Gas i- mere's most advanced post in that direction. Between this neighbour oo an a o oc we are entirely shut off from the Indus and its affluents, and consequently from the direct route between the Pamir and India. But we know from native travellers that, as nr most parts of this region, the higher portions of the valleys around the water-parting aie open and comparatively level, while their approaches from the south narrow and duiicuit. 51. One o{ the alternative passes (the Baroghil) is thus described (f™” Natrve .nfomr- ation) in Davies’ Trade Report, Appendix, p. xxm—“ irom the base to the surnm 0[ cxxxviii ]' gradual ascent for three kos (say five miles). Thence a plateau or elevated level plain about four kos wide, flanked by high ridges, .... in length from south to north about five kos. The descent from the northern extremity of the plateau to the base on the other side of the range is equally gentle and sloping with the ascent. The plateau .... is a rich pasturage where the Badakshan and Chitral people take large herds of cattle .... to graze m summer Laden horses and camels pass through the pass with ease; it is practicable also for laden carts.” I may add to this that Muhammad Shah, late Meer of Badakshan, took some guns across it, a year or two ago, into Chitral. 52. The alternative Ishkaman Pass seems to be equally easy. There are also four other alternative passes in this neighbourhood over the same watershed, which are thus described | Davies’ Trade Report, p. ccclvi.]—“The Shingshal Pass is passable to laden horses, and is open throuohout the year .... The Ghundrab, Kalik, and Mintaka Passes are close to each other: they are easier than the Shingshal Pass/’ To the east and west of this neighbourhood the passes become more difficult, as the Yarkund River on the east and the Upper Oxus on the west run in deep gorges; but in the space between them the high protuberance of Pamir forms as it were a scaffolding almost on a level with the great water-parting, while a corre sponding upheaval of the ground on the south of the range, opposite this particular point, affords similar facilities of access on that side. Captain Raverty (quoted in Rawlinson’s England and Russia, Chapter IV, page 233, 1st Ed.) says—“ The road is somewhat difficult between Panj-korah and Brush” (perhaps the line by the Bajour valley may be easier), “but beyond it is very good, and the country is like a vast plain gradually sloping upwards towaids the high table-land of Pamir to the north-east; . . . . consequently there would be no difficulty for the passage of light artillery.” Along all this great north and south line of route there are only three points where we could approach it, and learn anything about it: 1 $^, from Yarkund by Sarikol; Ind, from Gilgifc in the Maharaja of Cashmere’s territory; 3rd, from the Peshawur Valley. All the rest of its course is hidden from us. 53. The consideration of the facilities of access between the Alai plain and the head waters of the Indus affluents, has led us past the whole breath of the Ameer of Kashgar’s western frontier The subject Kirghiz occupy the valleys and gorges on the east of the Pamirs, while various tribes of Arian origin inhabit those on the west. Some of these are subject to the Afghan rule, but are practically not much interfered with by their masters; and while this is the case, collisions between east and west are not very probable. A Badakshi auxiliary force was however of great assistance to the Ameer in his early conquests in Kashgaria; while only lately the Ex-Meer of Badakshan, Jahandar Shah, alter being defeated in an attempt to recover his former dominions from the Afghans, came near to taking shelter in Kashgar. The Ameer however managed to avoid the necessity of either giving or refusing hospitality to this compromising guest, and the latter went off to the Russian dominions where his presence is mentioned in a late number of the Turkestan Gazette. 51. The southern frontier of Kashgaria is bordered by the great Himalayan mountain- system, which may be divided into two belts, the Tibetan region to the north, and a region of Alpine nature to the south. The characteristics of the former are great sterility and rolling plains at a great elevation, intersected by high ranges with comparatively easy passes. The routes in this region present few physical difficulties, and are scarcely ever impracticable at whatever season of the year, as there falls but little snow, though the necessity for carrying supplies is always a source of difficulty. The southern belt is marked by deep gorges and precipitous ridges; and here the physical obstacles to traffic have had to be overcome by the construction of more or less expensive roads; while the passes are closed for several months of winter. The north-western portion of the former belt (in which direction, however, it begins to lose its general elevation) is inhabited by the independent Dai’d tribes, who extend over into some of the valleys (Raskam and Shingshal) on the Central Asian side of the water-parting. These people, known as Kanjutis, were formerly notorious for their raids on the nearest villages in Yarkund territory and for waylaying the caravans on the Karakoram route. But since the Chinese rule has given pi .ice to that of the present Ameer, these disorders have ceased, and the Kanjutis are on their good behaviour. 55. The Cashmere Government rules over the greater part of the mountain region separating Eastern Turkestan from India. The Cashmere dependency of Ladak is a kind of half-way-house between the two countries, and here the two chief routes from India, viz., that via Cashmere proper, and that by the British hill districts of Kulu and Lahaul, unite. The latter route, together with the onward section as far as the Turkestan frontier, was placed by the Treaty of 1870 under the jurisdiction of two Joint Commissioners, one appointed by the British and the other by the Cashmere Government for the protection of trade. 56. The question of our commerce with Eastern Turkestan has excited some controversy, and it seems proper that I should throw such light on it as the latest facts can give. It has been thought by some writers a sufficient condemnation of our past policy to point out that the sums expended recently in opening out intercourse with Kashgaria are probably greater than have been the profits of the trade during the same period. Even on this narrow ground the argument is scarcely conclusive. A private firm or company will lay out money for years in developing a connection, regardless of the absence of immediate profit. In many thingsaffairs must be considered valuable. Without the bond of commerce (conducted in such a way as to be an appreciable benefit and not a burthen and infliction on them) we must either hive abstained altogether from direct intercourse with them, or else have entered upon it on avowedly political grounds. Now, we have gained as it were access to a friend’s house, from which we can obtain a flanking view and observe the occurrences m Western Turkestan from which we are otherwise cut off by the Hindoo Kush and by the tribes that inhabit its flanks. 63. If, as seems probable, there has been in several cases a tendency on the part of the Russian frontier officers, eager for distinction, to exaggerate into the importance of a casus belli questions which might have been solved by more peaceable means, and thus to force the hand of the Imperial Government, as it were, in the direction of war then the European publicity secured for the frontier affairs of Kashgaria by our access to it as neutral observers, present there on our own lawful occasions, is likely in similar cases to turn the scale in favor of greater moderation and less precipitancy on the part of the subordinate agents of Russia, regarding whom one of themselves writes :— « Not only the Russian Generals, but even the youngest Lieutenants, raved after further extension of territory, while those of the officers who were entrusted with any sort of inde pendent command, carried into effect their individual schemes.'” [Russia and England in Central Asia, by M. A. Terentyef, St. Petersburg 1875. Translated by P. C. Daukes, B.C.S. Printed at the Foreign Department Press, 1876, Yol. II., p. 66 .] 64. Publicity would probably minimize the danger of collisions being brought about by the hot-headedness of local officers anxious to pick a quarrel with their semi-civilized neigh bours, and would reduce the chances of an attack by Russia on Kashgaria, to the case of the deliberate action of either party or the misconduct ot unruly subjects of the Asiatic power. That the Ameer will avoid such madness on his own part and on that of his subjects is shown by his consistent endeavours (mentioned in former paragraphs) to satisfy the just requirements of Russia. He has both the will and the power to do so, and he is likely to prove a far better neighbour than she has yet had in Central Asia. There would then only remain the possibility of Russia for some purpose of her own, without the inducement of insults or wrongs to avenge, deliberately undertaking the conquest of Kashgaria. The supposition that she might do this for the sake of obtaining a shorter and easier road into China, is not borne out by the physical characters of the region. She is already in possession of a route to China, shorter and easier than that via Kashgar, namely, that by the Ila valley. Thus, under present circumstances, some at least of the possible causes or occasions for an attack on Kashgar can be withdrawn in a calculation of chances. 65. That the publicity mentioned above is the chief advantage which the Ameer expects from our friendship, and not any material aid in men or money (any offer of the former would, I believe, be positively distasteful to him), is to be gathered from the whole tone of his conversation. He frequently makes allusion to the fact of his kingdom having emerged through our help into the light of day and into the knowledge of the Western nations. In his parting message to me, sent through the Dadkhwah of Yarkund, he spoke pointedly of the mutual friendship of the two States (England and Kashgaria) as being “ be-gharz ” or “ without requirements” from one side or the other. If one might interpret in few words the idea which he apparently wishes to convey to us, they would, I think, be these: “ You wish for the maintenance of my rule in this country. In the furtherance of my own interest, which is the same, my conduct towards Russia is, and will continue to be, such as to give no ground for attack. I ask of you no sacrifices. All I desire is that, through your means, my conduct may become known when it will avail me, and where I have no means of making myself heard.” * * Mr. Schuyler, Secretary to the United States Legation at St. Petersburg, says that “ the (Russian) Foreign Office is badly informed of what goes on, and the Government has from time to time been dragged into war rather to support its officials than from any fixed policy of aggression. English opinion is very much considered, and particular steps are often not taken lest some difficulty with England should arise from them.36 APPENDIX XV. [Referred to in. paragraph 115 of Chapter /',] CONFIDENTIAL REPORT BY SIR DOUGLAS FORSYTH, C.B., K.C.S.I., LATE SPECIAL ENVOY TO KASHGAR. In the general report which I am submitting on the proceedings o£ the mission to Kash. gar, and on the condition and history of the country, I have endeavoured to give all the information that is ol ordinary public interest. But in addition to this we have been able to acquire special information which may be of some importance to the Government of India at this present juncture when events in Asia are so rapidly changing- that a knowledge of the state of parties live or ten years ago is but a little guide to a comprehension of what is passing now. 2 . General Kaufmann has made the remark that the acquisition of a knowledge of any- thing of a political character in Central Asia, except by personal observation, is so difficult as to be almost impossible, and my own experience leads me to the same conclusion. If, there fore, when treating of subjects on which I have had to derive my information from the state ments of others second or third hand, subsequent experience should prove me to be wrong, I trust the recognized difficulty of the position may be taken into account. 3. The Government of India will probably expect to be informed,— First. —As to the nature of the country and. character of the people over whom the Ameer of Kashgar rules. Second. —As to the nature of that rule, and the chances of its continuance viewed from an internal point. Third. —The character of his relations with foreign powers and his ability to resist attack. 4 . As it was part of my instructions, if practicable, to return via Badakshan and Cabul, and I was placed in a position to collect some information regarding Afghanistan as it is viewed from behind the drop-scene, so to speak, which is placed before us in India, I propose to add remarks on this country also. First .—Nature of the country and character of the people of Kashgar. 5. The kingdom which Ameer Yakoob Khan has carved out for himself is for all pur poses of internal government sufficiently well defined on three sides; and the people who inhabit the eastern slopes of the great mountain chain which under the names of Pamir, Alai- Ala-Tagh, Tian-Shan, and Tengri Khan, extend from Taghdumbash just north of the Hindoo Kush to Kara-Shahr, and even beyond to Turfan, all owe him undivided allegiance; within this basin, if it may be so called, a great variety of tribes is to be found, and the general character of all except when their martial energies are called forth by some political excitement is that of peaceful industrious inhabitants. I can speak from experience regarding the inhabitants of the south side of the country, which is probably the most richly cultivated and most thickly populated. Everywhere we found the villagers good husbandmen and devoted to their work. It was frequently asserted by the Ameer’s officials who accompanied us in our travels that these people were exceedingly docile and disinclined to mix themselves up m politics. The appearance of the country favors such a belief. The peasants houses are scattered over the country with no sort of protection from open attacks or from robberies. Cu tivation, which is entirely dependent on irrigation from the numberless streams and canals which flow from the mountains or well up from hundreds of springs, is most luxuriant and can be increased to any extent, and there is reason to assume that if Kashgar were to fall mto the hands of a European power, or if the present Ruler take advantage of his contact with Europeans to introduce the benefits of western civilization, and above all, if the Governmentljesete sure, the prosperity of this country north of the great Himalayan range would rapidly equal that of the Punjab. 6 . In thews and sinews the beef-eating Turks, bracel as a free from prejudices, and thoroughly struck me as'being far more akin to superior, physically, to any inhabitants of India. I J • , intellio-ence thouo-h Eurooean than Afe-hans or anv other Asiatics of the south, and in point of intelligence, ttiougti •nuiopean man Aignans 01 auy uuuc rKcnlav readiness of invention and an not so quick or subtle as people of the s0 ^ ^ en J qq iey understand how to economise aptness for taking advantage of mechanical impiovemc • j labor, and have a decidedly practical turn of mind. . A t i u lu . i , i-i material of the agricultural districts is exceedingly good I should say, then, that the law matenai or and capable of great things by way of production.7. From what we could learn regarding the same class towards the north, who thickly people the suh-mountain tract between Aksu and Kara-Shahr, I should say that their characteristics are much the same. Higher up on the mountain sides are the different tribes of Kirghiz who wander with their flocks and herds from pasture to pasture, and who refuse altogether to abandon their nomad habits for a settled life. These have not the same prospect or perhaps power of expansion as we may look for in the settled agricultural population, but in a land where meat is consumed by all even to the lowest beggar, the existence of a large race of shepherds is an important element when considering the wealth of the country. 8 . The town population of this kingdom is a less satisfactory feature, owing partly to the remarkable absence of manufacturing industry. Hitherto, the wants of the people have been comparatively few, and their tastes simple, though far, very far from being uncivilized or savage as some in ignorance have supposed, but grain being plentiful and payments for service being in kind, the temptation to spend money on luxuries has been comparatively small, 9 . It is a mistake to suppose there are no manufactures at all, for we were much struck by seeing strings of ponies and camels laden with bales of cotton goods passing from the east to Badakshan and Kokand, and even to Russia. But it was a matter of remark that in a cold climate where the finest wool is grown and the people could not exist without the warmest clothing, not a single manufacture of woollen cloth of any kind was to be seen. The use of sheep skin as a lining for all garments and the manufacture of a felt as a floor covering for all houses accounts for the disposal of the large amount of wool which is found in a country abounding with flocks. 10. Though the country abounds in mineral wealth, and here and there we saw good fur naces for smelting ore, and observed other indications of mines having been worked, the manu facture of metal cannot be said to have reached anything approaching to perfection, in fact except for the most ordinary necessaries of life the people are dependent on trade with foreign countries for the supply of their wants. This naturally encourages a spirit of enterprise amongst the townpeople and an amount of activity which often degenerates into a restless discontent against their rulers. 11 . Fanatical zeal for religion is not a characteristic of the agricultural population. Long accustomed to the easy tolerance of the Chinese rule, when laxity of morals and a love of sensual pleasure prevailed, the Mahomedans outside the towns rather sigh for the liberty of conscience they once enjoyed and now have lost. But in the towns the rows and insurrections which periodically deluged their streets with blood were rather the results of a desire to get rid of the bated Chinese yoke than of any extraordinary zeal for the faith. Without doubt, however, whatever the cause may be, the inhabitants of Kashgar, Yarkund, Khoten, and notably Kuchar, have rendered themselves conspicuous in history by their frequent insurrections, and there is a turbulent element in all these cities which requires to be held in check by a master-hand. Arguing from analogy, there is little reason to suppose that if the blessings of Western science are made known to these people, and factories spring up in the town, the spirit of liberty and agitation for change which seems to dwell in our factories, will be absent from Yarkund, and however much reform and progress with reason are desirable a merely insurrectionary spirit is not to be commended. 12. There is one broad distinctive feature in both town and country which places the people of Eastern Turkestan on a lofty pedestal above Afghans, Persians, and Indians. They have no prejudice of caste or of race, no old animosities against the Feringhee, little proselytiz ing zeal, and no hesitation to mix with foreigners. Wherever we went we found the tradesmen in the bazaar or the headman of the village anxious to receive and entertain us hospitably. One day when I was visiting the different serais in the city of Kashgar, I found it was etiquette to accept a heavy luncheon at each place, and I could only avoid offence by promising to call again and see the rest, when I found the process of repeated dining could not be continued. 13. There is a geniality of manner and a thorough good-heartedness in these people which has been noted by all travellers from the earliest times. When they met some of the Hindoo portion of our party I was struck by noticing that they did not look upon their pre judices with contempt, or withdraw the skirt of their garment from contact in pride or disgust, as we may see done elsewhere; but there was an inability to understand why a set of men should cut themselves off from the blessings which God had given to all, and a feeling of com passion for such deluded mortals. In some of the towns, Yarkund for instance, where Cash- mere intrigue exerts a baneful influence, as it does wherever it exists, Hindoos are at times subjected to annoyance, and proselytizing zeal is directed to their discomfort, but this has been noticed as the result of Cashmeree intrigue from the days of Moorcroft and Burnes, and has nothing to do with the present state of Cashmere polities. And the primary cause of this is unquestionably the jealousy on the part of the less skilful Mahomedan merchant, of their far cleverer and more business-like rivals, the Hindoos. Love of profit, under guise of the love of God, is at the bottom of the intolerance of Hindoos in Yarkund. In Kashgar the difference between Hindoos and Mahomedans was, we found, much less marked, and if a Hindoo was[ cxliii ] wise enough in his own generation not to obtrude his exclusive or desire to interfere with him. exclusive prejudices, there was no attempt 14. A good deal has been heard of the TnnorirMo Qn/ i u • t describe them now. They undoubtedly are a troublesome portion of the i',',. i !'| , ''' S&lt;arV l n” me , t0 that in the direction of Kara-Shahr and Turfan they prove to be e soim-e 'of ’oo U ' t Ameer; but there are very few south of Aksu, and^rly'all thX^.^ ““ 15. The number of pure Chinese (all compelled to profess Islam) remainino in the country is greater than I should have supposed to judge of the stories of wholesale m»e whmh were brought over the mountains a few years ago, hut they are too few to be taken So account except as peaceful ar izans. Such then is, so far as I a,n able to form an opinion he general character of the people who have become the subjects of Ameer Yakoob Khan. 16. There-is no potentate living who has acquired more completely the title of an orien tal despot than Y akoob Khan, Atahk Ghazee. His character has been painted in the blackest colors, and there were not a few who thought that the visit of a British mission to his court was like a venture into a lion s den. Happily close contact with him and free intercourse with his people have enabled us to form a tolerably correct and more favorable opinion of his character and rule. 17. During the struggle which brought Yakoob Khan on to the scene in Kastmar and go long as he had to fight for supremacy, it would be vain to expect that moderation of refine ment would find a place m the counsels or actions of him or of any Asiatic Chief. Treachery in love or war is not a sin in the eyes of good Mahomedans, and the stories which are only too truly told of perfidious acts and of wholesale murders are to be viewed with reference to the manners and customs of the country and people where such scenes are enacted. Coups d’etat are common to all countries where despotism in any form exists, and if in highly civiliz ed European countries scores of citizens whose offence is that their political views are opposed to the Government of the day, are seized and hurried off to languish in exile for the rest of their clays, we cannot be surprised if in Asiatic countries a despotic ruler should get rid of obnoxious subjects by sending them to that borne from which there is no return. 18. So long as war is being carried on there must be excesses, and it is scarcely fair to condemn a man on the exaggerated reports which are invariably spread by the vanquished, or on the boasts of victors. Certainly, so far as our enquiries extended, there was no such wholesale massacre of helpless inhabitants by Yakoob Khan as we read of in the annals of the Mogul dynasties. It is said that in the country about Manas the land was devastated and the population destroyed by the AmeeCs armies; but this assertion comes through Russian sources, and cannot be accepted without much suspicion and enquiry. It is to the interest of Russia to represent Yakoob Khan in the most unfavorable light. 19. From the time that Yakoob Khan established his undisputed authority he has mani fested the strongest desire to rule with justice according to the precepts of the koran. In fact, owing to his previous inexperience in the work of administration, Ameer Yakoob Khan endeavours to take the koran for his guide in all matters and to gain a character fur sanctity by enforcing its maxims of government and religious exercises. 20. Offences against the State, and crimes, such as murder, robbery, and adultery are dealt with severely, and the consequence is that in no part of the world is the life or property of private citizens safer than in Kashgar. 21. A merchant armed with the usual passport can travel with his goods from one end of the country to the other without fear of molestation. The common people are subjected to no great oppression, or wholesale plunder by the officials, and it is a remarkable feature in his rule, and an example of one advantage at all events which can be extracted from despotic gov ernment, that however far distant the province may be from the seat of Government, tre Ameer's officials have a wholesome dread of incurring the wrath of their master by grvrng re people ground of complaint. When the Governor of a provime brings lus year y revenue o the Ameer, all complaints made again«t him are attended to, the Ameer devo rug rmse con tinuously to the work of enquiring into his system of government, &amp;c., &amp;c., untrl tire attarrs ot the particular province are disposed of. It is a characteristic of his mode o . go vein men a the Ameer trusts no one, and no one trusts his fellow : consequently no o era ee s sure a his actions may not be reported to bead-quarters. There may be grea evr m ^ ns, au tainly there is a great want of liberty of action : we found that our sma es s ,, , , be forwarded to the King for orders, and that no. official dared to am upon * s ‘ responsibility. Officials and subjects are all kept in a state of pupr age. . Pabit consultations between individuals are disallowed, and I have a.rear) exp ‘fe 1 , ., ou |q of visiting from house to house is strongly discouraged. Such a J st ® m of d fc &lt; t all intolerable to Europeans, but seems to be well understood by these people and not at repugnant to their ideas. , i -i 22. The Governors of towns maintain regular agents in each mobu a w the most trifling details regarding the manner of life of t ie in a • Q. overnors w } 10 are has similarly a certain number of confidential news-agents v ro r ,• ri ^ Ameer j trusted; or are employed on special service as news-writers, reporting directly toGovernors being obliged to furnish the messengers for the conveyance of their reports. This system has one advantage, that the humblest complaints reach the ears of the highest, and the tyranny and exactions of local officials are kept in check. 23. It was said now and then by some of the people whom we met that they preferred the Chinese rule because they were less taxed and less subjected to religious exercises. I believe there is truth in the statement that the Chinese Governors as a rule were lenient in this respect; but the amount of taxation levied by the Ameer is in strict accordance with the precept of the koran,—one-tenth of the produce of the laud and one in forty or 2 | per cent, in the case of flocks and merchandise being levied. All other cesses, such as house-tax, tax on looms, &amp;c., are unknown, and in this respect the condition of the people in Kashgar contrasts favorably with that of the people in India. The Ameer reserves to himself the right of pre emption over all goods offered for sale. Forced loans have been taken from the merchants, and in time of war horses and goods have been forcibly purchased; but the loans have been repaid, and though we heard complaints that the valuation put upon property thus taken was often too low, the complaint is open to question; and anyhow we heard of the owners demand ing and often gaining compensation, so that the amount of oppression likely to be done is not great. I am aware that the absence of failure in the present system is entirely due to the force of the Ameer's own character; otherwise I should have to record a very different state of feeling amongst the people. 24. It is the Ameer's practice to leave the collection of the land revenues and the fiscal management of the various provinces to his Dadkhwahs and other Lieutenants. They are responsible for the maintenance of their army and of all public establishments, and after defraying all expenses are required to send the surplus to the Royal Treasury. No detailed accounts are rendered to the Ameer, nor has he any system of records by which he can check the receipts and expenditure in each province. 25. A Government more absolutely bereft of statistical information it is impossible to conceive. Syud Yakoob Khan has more than once lamented to me the deficiency of his master in this respect. The details of civil administration are wholly unknown and little cared for by him, and, as a natural consequence, he loses a considerable amount of legitimate income. 26. Many of the officials attached to the Court invest their earnings in trade ventures, and some of them are increasing their wealth rapidly. Jemadar Nubbi Buksh, for instance, makes regular loans to merchants in the city of Kashgar. The accumulated wealth of the Ameer in stores collected by plunder of the Chinese, &amp;c., must be very much greater than would appear by the absence of display at his Court. His enormous power over his own officials is based on the expectation of special rewards and large presents, as well as on the certainty of speedy punishment if offence is given. 27. If the Ameer's successor be a man of less force or character and is unable to maintain a wholesome influence over his subordinates, and is indifferent to the administration of justice, the Government must fall into disorder, and extortion and cruelty will effect the ruin of the people. 28. I might indulge in the hopes which Syud Yakoob Khan fondly cherishes in spite of all discouragement that his master may be induced to adopt a proper system of Government which shall not be wholly dependent on the rule of a single individual, however able and vigorous. But it is my duty here to give a faithful portrait of things as they are, leaving the future to disclose itself. 29. I now come to the question of the Ameer's rule continuing, supposing it to be threatened by no other thap, internal trouble. The dangers he has in this respect to fear arise from three sources, viz .— I.—The possible insurrection of the people. II.—The possible hostility of the Khoja interest. III.—The discontent of his own followers. 30. As for the first cause it is impossible to assert that the Tungani element in the north part of his dominions may not derive such an accession of strength from brethren across the border as to cause the disaffected to try their hand once more at insurrection. The injudicious action of a too zealous officer may rouse the excitable nature of the people in Kuchar or Kara-Shahr; but judging by the experience of the past, I should say there was little fear of their being able to effect anything like a successful combination. From the peasantry and people generally there is nothing to fear; for they are unwarlike, and I should say very indifferent to all forms of Government, so long as they are left in undisturbed possession of their fields and houses. 31. As regards the second possible cause of trouble, so far as our information goes, all the leading Khojas who came to the front during the revolt of the Tunganis perished in the destruction of the. Khoja principality formed by Rashuddin with Kuchar as his capital. There are, it is said, still many members of the Kuchar colony of Khojas residing on their ancestral estates in the suburbs of Kuchar; but none of them are men of note or influence beyond their immediate vicinity. The only Khoja of note now in the country, so far as I canlearn, is Hakim Khan Torah, son of the late Eshan Khan Torah of the Kokand Khoia family and he is a trusted oflicer m the Ameer’s service. Under the Chinese rule it was the Kokand Khojas who always laised levolt, and in these hostilities it does not appear that they were ever joined by then- cmperes ot kuchar, for the success of their insurrections never spread beyond the three States oi: Ivhoteiij Yarkund, and Kashgar in any one of their four attempts to over throw Chinese rule. I he present representative of the Kokand Khojas is Buzurg Khan who was ousted from the patrimony, he was sent to take possession of, by the present ruler of the country. This Buzurg Khan, it is said, is now living at Kokand on the bounty of Khuda Yar Khan. He is said to have four sons living with him. J 32. The Kuchar Khojas only appear to have made an attempt to get the government of the country into their own hands on this one occasion of the Tungani revolt, which originated on their side of the country; and they only took advantage of an opportunity that presented itself; they were not the prime movers in the rebellion as were the Kokand Khojas in the previous revolts which were raised in the western towns by their own interested activity; but appear to have assumed the control of affairs at a period of utter confusion by the weight of their priestly influence and position in society. In fact, the authority they now assume seems to have been forced upon them by the nature of the case. The Tungani rebels had destroyed the Chinese Government, but they set up no other in its place; and in the absence of such the Kuchar Khojas, under Rashuddin as their leader, endeavoured to establish a Khoja principality on the ruins of the overturned rule. And at the time that Buzurg Khan arrived as a claimant at Kashgar, Rashuddin was acknowledged King all over the country from Yarkund to Turfan, though his short reign was one of incessant trouble and discord. 33 . The power of the Kuchar Khojas for future mischief seems almost completely broken now, and little is to be apprehended from any political influence they may possess. It seems otherwise with Buzurg Khan; he has been acknowledged as the lawful heir to the Government, and is deprived of his rights by an usurper with no other claim to possession than that of might against right. In this view if he should, or his sons should, hereafter claim the Government at the instigation, properly supported, of interested parties, he would no doubt be able to cause the Ameer considerable difficulty, for he has ruled in Kashgar as the acknowledged King, and his son can claim the succession as heir to his father at any fitting opportunity in the future. This is the chief danger that menaces the Ameer's Government from the Khoja party. Buzurg, or his son, may remain quiet during the Ameer's life, hut they may contest the succession with his son. 34 . The third source of trouble is to be found in the constitution of the Ameer's Court, which is composed almost entirely of Andijanis. In fact, he and hrs followers are, m a measure, as alien to the people of the country as the English are to India and his officials know less of the geography and of the names of the villages than we did of the Punjab when we took that country. Frequently when travelling about with the Ameer s officers, if we asked what such and such a village was, or who a certam local magnate might be they would lanoffims-lv reply that they were strangers to the country. W hen I proposed to return to India W the Kogyar route, Tashkhoja, the Dadkhwah s confidential agent, was quite ignorant o/the orography, and on each day's march he would come to me for information. Once m twice when an opportunity occurred, and the people of the country were m a confi dential mood, they would speak to us of the Andijan, officers in terms of dislike. o- T 1 • mvima. facie would he an argument in favor of the stability of the Ameers rule, ^ it would be supposed that at all events from various indications I am dispose o re ® Nearly every Audijani discontent with their Chief, which rey ai ® n 1 , ^ consequence of hostility now serving with the Ameer has become an X/e oi shaTng in his prosperity 7 to Russia, or has been tempted to j . . ^ i j ^hu mercy of the Russian They have nearly all left their families or re a-ion ' tliem . f or p have heard of threats Government, and this gives the Russians a cei ^ ficrlltino . a o- a inst the Russians, their families being conveyed to them that m the ev « possible then that the Ameer might find at home will be subjected to repnsa . 1 ^ ( j e p ect ; on 0 f his own officers. Mirza himself weakened, or at all events sore y ^ Ameer amongst his own followers, as Ahmed would probably lead any movement agmnst the Ameer he is reported to have attempted oing som ^ of hig f 0 ii owe r. S ; and Syud 36. His system of distrust, too, is J , ” on He lamented much the Yakoob Khan in our parting interview aid §£ * J h gaf rely&gt; mentioning Mahomed Ameer's want of good Hieutenants ^ on whom the Ameer bestowed Yunus Dadkhwah of Yarkund as tl f V ch ^ ct er is such that I think he is quite able his full confidence. My opinion of the A and ig undisturbed from to manage the whole country by himself, and so ^ng^ without, his rule will continue with un i _ ^hp'heir-anparent, Beg Kuli Beg, and it would 37 . 1 had only one opportunity of seeing Vl^ rnment from so transient he unfair to form a “ opim^-^tid nh speak favorably of his powers, and this an acquaintance. But 03 uuopinion is coincided in by others, so that the prospect is not altogether good, and justifies the anxiety which Syud Yakoob Khan did not attempt to disguise from me regarding the stability of his master's rule. 38. Fortunately for the Ameer, he has in his nephew, this man Syud Yakoob Khan, one of the shrewdest, most intelligent, and enlightened of Asiatics. Having spent many years in Constantinople, and being naturally very liberal-minded as regards politics (though in personal expenditure he has, I am sorry to say, acquired an evil character for stinginess), he knows exactly what his master ought to do, and if allowed full authority, would doubtless establish a tolerably sound system of government. His influence with his uncle has always been beneficially exercised, but he has had to contend against jealousies and intrigue, as well as against the ignorant suspicions of the Ameer. For the Ameer has a fickle and most sus picious nature, as I found frequently to my great annoyance, and on several occasions when Syud Yakoob Khan failed to carry out some point or other in our negotiations, on which we were agreed, he was obliged to confess that counter-influence had been too much for him. 39. But we may hope that the Ameer, who at the present time is 51 years old, and in the full vigour of manhood, may be spared to reign in peace for many years to come, and that the wise counsels of such an adviser as the Syud may avail to establish a settled system of government. 40. In the letter of instructions I was directed to ascertain the political boundaries of the kingdom of Kashgar, and I found this no easy matter, because the Ameer himself does not seem to be quite certain as to their limits; but so far as I am able to judge, they are as follows:— Commencing from the south-east corner, there is no question that the Kuen-Luen range is, and always has been, in Yarkund territory; and as the jade quarries in the lower Karakash valley have been worked by the Chinese for the last 150 years, we may assume that the valley forms a boundary. To judge from the names of places, Turki words are used to designate halting places up to the Sasser Pass, and on the left bank of the Shyok river there are still the remains of a wall and fortification erected more than two centuries ago by the Raja of Ladak to check the invasion of the Turks. Daulat-beg-uldi and Kara Korum Brangsa are Turki names, and we read in the Tarikh-i-Rashidi that Sultan Syud came with a force of 5,000 horsemen and overran the whole country of Ladak. This invasion was twice repeated; and it may be remarked, with reference to the supposed impassable character of those moun tains, that from the very earliest time, centuries before the Christian era, Khoten was invaded from India and incursions from one side or the other have been periodically made. 41. Though these facts however have historic interest at the present time, so far as I could ascertain from the Yarkundis themselves, no claim is asserted to any tract of country south of the Karakash river; and on the Yarkund river they do not come higher up than Kufeelong; but for convenience sake I would put the boundary at Ak-Tagh; and in laying out supplies I practically made that point the limit. The line then would run from the eastern corner of the Kuen-Luen, longitude 81, down to Karakash river to Suget, across that pass to Ak-Tagh, longitude 78'5, (approximate) latitude 35’59; thence down the Yarkund river to Kunjut 42. Kunjut is beyond Yarkund territory, and little or nothing is known of the geography of that part; but taking the line somewhere along the northern slope of the great Himalayan chain through Taghdumbash, we come to Aktash on the Pamir, and thence by the Tagharma plain to Kizil Art. 43. The Kirghiz of the Kizil Art plain owe an easy kind of allegiance, at one time to Kokand, and at another to Kashgar; and unfortunately this servitude of two masters is not unlikely to cause complications to which I shall allude presently. 44. In the extreme western corner the Terek Pass leading to Kokand is a well-defined boundary. Thence it passes along the watershed of the Ak-Tagh to Chadir-kul, regarding which Colonel Gordon gives his testimony. When he was starting for that lake, I asked where the Russian boundary was, and received the reply that Tash Robat was in Kashgar territory, and a fort there, built by one of the former rulers of Kashgar, and still extant, seemed to bear out this assertion. But on reaching the Fort of Chakmak, Colonel Gordon learned that practically the Russian boundary had been pushed forward so as to include the Chadir-kul, and too local Governor of the fort accepted the Torgat Pass as the Russian boundary. From thence the line passes along the high mountain Tianshan range north and north-east to Kanu Shahr. There is no positively defined line, but it is understood that the slopes on the east and south belong to the Ameer, and those on the other side belong to Russia or China. The intermediate ridges and plateau are practically no man's land. Such is the explanation given to me by some Kirghiz whom 1 met in the Artysh valley when we stood in front of the great Aksai chain and had a glorious panoramic view of the Tianshan mountains. In this chain beyond the Chakmak and Terektz fortifications there are only two practicable passes—one the Bedul, which communicates between Issikkul and Ush Turfan, the other is the Muzart Pass on the road from Aksu to Kuldja.[ cxlvii ] 45.

Ameer Yakoob Khan may be said to be hedged in on all side’s by three o-reat powers China, Russia, and hngland-and I will now consider what chance he has ol livkio at peace with all three. Commencing with China I believe that to this day the Pekin Government keep up on paper the fiction of having Governors at Kashgar, Yarkand, &amp;c.; but. practically they have abandoned possession of the country west of Turfan; and if our representative It the Emperor s Court be correct in his information, the Chinese have no thought of twins' to recover these lost provinces. Rumours, however, of an aggressive character are constantly put forth, and undoubtedly tend to the Ameer’s disquiet. It was said, when I was at Kabsgar that a large Chinese army was crossing, armed with European rifles, and of course it was said that Russia was aiding the attack. It was exceedingly difficult to get at anythino- like the truth •, but so far as I could gather from Syud Yakoob Khan, the Chinese had '’recovered Khamil (called Kumul) fiom the lunganis, who came in a body to Turfan early this year, or at the end of last year, and asked for a place in the Ameer's dominions offering to serve him. It so happened that about that time Syud Yakoob Khan was charged by the Ameer to ask my advice with reference to Russian advances and such matters ; officially I was prohibited from giving advice, but as a friend I pointed out what, in my judgment, appeared to be a weak point in the Ameer's policy. So long as he confined his conquests within the great barrier which nature had raised to defend Kashgaria, it appeared to me that he was holding a strong position, but when he crossed the mountains and took cities in the northern valleys, thus blocking up the direct road between Kuldja and China, he not only exposed his weakness to attack from the Chinese, but he was certain to bring upon him the wrath of Russia who was bent on opening out the Kuldja route to China. I was able at the same time to give from the Almanac-de- Gotha some statistics about the armament of China, Russia, and other powurs, which astonished even the Syud's enlightened comprehension. Soon after he told me that the Ameer, having pondered over all the information I gave, had determined to withdraw from Manas and Orumtsi; and at our parting interview in May the Syud repeated that this had been done. 49. Still the Ameer is afraid of attack from that quarter, and he made a special request that I would represent his case to His Excellency the Viceroy and procure some assurance from the Chinese Government; I therefore mention this now. 50. But his chief dread is, of course, Russia, who is gradually surrounding him on three sides as I shall presently show. Commencing on the north, Russia has taken possession of Kuldja, and apparently of the whole Hi valley up to the range which separates it from Yulduz; she can thus threaten Kashgar by the Muzart Pass, and if we may believe the account put forth by Mr. Ashton Dilke, who wrote from near Kuldja, and being the guest of Russian officers, professed to express their views, it was actually arranged in 18to send a force by that route, whilst another army took the line of the Naryn and Chadirkul. This invasion was, he says, only averted by the timely concession to Count Kaulbars' demands by the Ameer. 51. Taking the part of the Tian Shan range, which runs south-west, the pass at Bedul, leading from Issikkul to Ush Turfan, is available for troops; but had it not been for the testimony of so careful an authority as Mr. Michell, I should describe it as not favorable lor the passage of large bodies. 52. Colonel Gordon has given a valuable report on tfie Terek and Terektz Passes and Chakmak Forts, which is appended to this report, and no further remark is needed from me. 53. The pass leading by the extreme south-west corner to Andijan and Kokand is, rhaps, the easiest of all, and'when the Russians take Kokand which, by all accounts, will be, fact, accomplished before another year is over, Ameer Yakoob Khan wi n imse veiy ui to attack from a force coming from Tashkend. 54. I have alluded to the Kirghiz on the Kizil Art, and their double allegiance to the ders of Kashgar and Kokand. When Russia takes Kokand, she will ol course cla ™ a •hts of that State up to the farthest limits, and this will bring her in collision with Yam[ oxlviii ] Khan in the direction of the Pamir. Russia will in fact command Tashkuygan, Sinkol, and the road across the Pamir to Wakhan, and thus at the point of junction between the Hindoo Kush, the Himalayas, and the Pamir plateau, Russia will be within a few miles of touching Cashmere. , . 55 With reference to the approaching- annexation of Kokand by Russia, I may men’ tion here that Khudayar Khan made overtures this spring to the Ameer of Kashgar to join in opposing Russia, and there were strong rumours of a jehad being proclaimed, but to all overtures he turned a deaf ear. 56 The question whether Ameer Yakoob Khan can resist Russia's open attack must be answered by a decided negative. Captain Biddulph has given a very correct estimate of the Ameer's military strength, and Colonel Gordon's remarks are quite in accordance with my ITT VX7C 57 It is true that the natural strength of the mountain defences has been increased by a o-ood system of fortifications, and could be held by a few resolute men well equipped and disciplined against a large invading force, but the Ameer’s army does not fulfil the necessary conditions. In artillery he is miserably weak; and though for individual valor his men may be equal to any force that can be brought against them, still discipline and military science must speedily gain the day. What might be the result if the Ameer were allowed some years of peace, during which time he availed himself of western help, I would not undertake to say; but unfortunately just at present fear prevents him from carrying out his own desires in this respect. The present organization of the Ameer's forces is essentially conservative and opposed to the introduction of military improvements from the west. Syud Yakoob Khan brought six or seven Turkish officers and artizans from Constantinople for the purpose if drilling his troops, and casting guns, &amp;c., but the Ameer would not allow them to be employed, and the Syud gave as his reason the Ameer's great dread lest Russia should think he was preparing to go to^war with her, and that thus he should bring down at once an invading army before he had time to prepare for resistance. 58. If, then, Ameer Yakoob Khan sees no hope, either now or in the future of resisting a warlike attack, his only chance of safety lies in adopting such a conciliatory tone in his dealino-s with the dreaded power that no possible cause of offence can be found. Such was the decided advice that I ventured to give, and in return I received ample assurance that this line of conduct would be adopted. 59. Unfortunately Asiatic rulers have not the same ideas of right and wrong that we have, and it is difficult for them not to seize an advantage if they think they can do so with impunity. False pride too, and love of despotic display, lead them to the commission of acts which they have afterwards to repent too often with serious loss. We had an instance of this during the visit of our mission. 60. In pursuance of the promises of the treaty concluded by Count Kaulbars, some Russian merchants sent over a venture of goods to Kashgar in 1878. Their story is that they were not allowed to sell their merchandise freely in the city, but that the Ameer took all to himself at his own valuation, which, of course, they said was much below the proper value, and they Were then summarily dismissed. 61. The version of this affair which I heard was somewhat more favorable to the Ameer, inasmuch as it was said that the full value of the goods was given, but the merchants were paid in cash and dismissed at once, whereas they wished to invest the money in return pur chases and so reap a profit both ways; and it was the loss of these return profits which was a legitimate ground of complaint. This seems probable, but in any case the Ameer was wholly in the wrong when he interfered with their liberty of action. Fortunately he had the good sense to send agents over to apologise and make reparation, and so, for a time, he has averted the storm. I believe his reason for thus dealing with them was his desire to have no Russians in the country whilst our mission was there. He had the idea then—and perhaps has still— that Russians and English cannot possibly meet except as deadly foes; and it is not very com plimentary to us, but still the fact, that when I urged the importance of the Ameer giving no sort of offence to Russia, and I explained the impossibility of England or any civilised power countenancing him in an act of bad faith, Syud Yakoob Khan advised me not to say too much on the subject, for it would only strengthen the Ameer’s belief that we were in great dread of Russia. 62. Another belief which is shared by him in common with all other Asiatics is, that Russia is not above irritating those with whom she wishes to quarrel, and thus compelling a cause of offence to arise. For this reason the Ameer saw wisdom in seeking the friendship of England and the protection of Turkey, hoping that by thus bringing his affairs before an European tribunal he might have some one to judge between himself and another. A con sideration of the advantage gained by having a competent person on the spot to judge of all that passes between himself and other powers induced the Ameer to consent to the establishment of an agent at Kashgar. I am convinced that he has no desire ever to see himself supported by British bayonets, or by British officers, but he looks to the moral support which a friend ship with us will give.2' [ cxlix ] KuJfat war should'‘° ^ f ™ nds with England and take whichever side he thinks will provetost adtr^‘tTh^'^ theU he “ USt potentate, but there are grounds for assuming that t Ameer yI^Tki 8 o£ . “f Asiatio sincere in his desire for the friendship of Her Maiestv tl e oT ¥“ ' at P reseut no reason to fear or dislike us. He is aware how wt,,, n r* 6 hrst P lace ’ be has bv way of the Karakorum, and though the sense of e - 3 , S lom a '^ su ^ &lt; P en attack be disturbed, when the comparative a^dvanlie' of tlm Chitr''! ? “T'* fu ‘ Ure «“* still I believe he will have no qualms f 01 S™d Yaknob Kb aud fl Pau,u ' “e d.selosed, our policy is not one of aggression, ami all the efforts of interested integers tobli “trout ^=^^Xr rtS ° £ our a PP r °ach with a large foree te take the^ • 65. Since the very nrst days of his rise to power, and his reception of Mr. Shaw the Ameer s policy has been persistently to seek our friendship, and this long before he had ti e advantage of his nephew’s experience and now that he and his court have become well at quamted with us, it is probable that they will form their ideas of the English character from the specimens now seen. It is with satisfaction then that I can point to the conduct of all the officers and followers who accompanied me, and can feel assured that if those who follow us into the country mamtain the same attitude and action, there will never arise in Eastern Turkestan those hitter memories which render Afghanistan, even now, a forbidden land to the English. 66. In connection with this subject, I may here notice a conversation held with Syud Yakoob Khan. In speaking about future ambassadors going to Kashgar, he said the Viceroy ought to remember the vast difference there is between India and that country. In India we have to deal with a subject race, and our officers are accustomed to treat even Princes as subor dinates, hut any such attempt in Eastern Turkestan would prove fatal to all friendship. 1 replied that I felt sure Mr. Shaw would thoroughly understand this. Yes, he said, the Ameer has great confidence in him, but at any future time whoever else may be appointed, should be specially selected with reference to the peculiarity of the people with whom he would have to deal. 67. There is no subject of greater importance in dealing with Eastern Turkestan, or indeed with Central Asian affairs, or more suggestive of reflection regarding our position in India than the remarks made by Synd Yakoob Khan on this subject. He frequently com mented to me on the great difference between the people of India and of Turkestan; and he noticed during his journeys through India the very domineering tone of Englishmen over the people, and even the Chiefs of Hindoostan. 68. Two chief causes of the great want of sympathy and communion between Englishmen and the natives of India are doubtless— I. —The fact that they stand in relation to each other of conquerors and conquered. II. —That the natives will not mix with us in soeial intercourse. The first reason is one, which by itself perhaps would not, or, at all events, ought not to produce estrangement, for in other countries and in former ages the conquerors and the con quered have commingled, in spite of difference of religion, and have become blended into one homogenous mass. Even the difference of race might be got over if other prejudices could be overcome, but in point of fact Englishmen and natives never do or can mix on equal terms, and the Indian political is very far from representing the diplomatic body which manages the affairs of our country with foreign powers. Any attempt at holding their own by Native Chiefs is viewed too frequently as improper opposition and gives offence. Similarly, if a Native gentleman tries to place himself on an equality with English officers, he is too often condemned as an upstart and impertinent. A feeling of innate superiority pervades the mind of every Englishman and causes him to assume a patronising or imperious air, which must often he most galling o a rve gentlemen. Its result, too often, is to breed irritation in their mmd and leads them to attempt all kinds of petty reprisals. Any one acquainted with official life knows the constant strugg es that are made by Rajas and others to gain a victory in some point of etiquet e, an can lecoun stories of officers being kept waiting purposely, or not met at a propel y lespcc u c is ance, or subjected to some petty annoyance; all done with the object of incieasing the impoitance o. the native, and lessening that of the Englishman in the eyes of spectators. These things done between ourselves and the people of India aie ba(I enough, but they are worse when practised towards Asiatics who owe us no allegiance and are . through India, or are the guests of our GoYerament. Syud Yakoob Khan ^ a «“ a every” sense of the word, yet, when he first passed through In * a . \ e serious annoyance. Ihrar Khan who came down to India as Envoy a &lt; g “j treatment, of which he does not cease to complain and which he tar ,. e&lt;Tar ding the Wed to retaliate upon us. Fortunately the recent orders of His E“e l len c y !e aru s proper treatment of Envoys will remove all possible complain as rega 3869. No doubt the difference of religion and custom has much to do with all this, and Englishmen justly feel their pride hurt when the commonest native refuses to take food or water at their hands. In the case of Mahomedans the refusal to eat and drink with us is wholly contrary to the rules of the Koran, and is the result of the debasement of their customs by contact with the Hindoos. No such prejudices are to be found in other Maho- medan countries, and in Turkestan Englishmen are admitted to a complete freedom of inter course, and are treated frankly on terms of perfect equality, without any of the hankering after petty reprisals which is so remarkable and troublesome in India. Our experience in Turkestan was that of honored guests ; and it may be said that we were not proper judges on this point, but we certainly had good opportunities of learning the manners and customs of the people, and we found no desire to subject us to petty annoyances, and as certainly, no intention on their part of adopting any cringing subservience. 69A. It has been remarked that the Russians get on much better with Asiatics than Englishmen do; they are said to accommodate themselves to their ways much more than we do, have less of our prejudices, and so forth. 70. On this subject the Editor of the Moscow Gazette onee remarked to me that Russia is now in the same position that we held in India a century ago; then we were in the minority altogether and could not afford to give ourselves airs; so Russia is or was when this conversation took place, but as he remarked, when once the Turks have been completely subdued, the Russians will assume all the haughty airs of conquerors, and will become as much disliked as we are said to be. But there is one difficulty we have had to contend with to which the Russians will never be exposed; they will not have to contend with the iron oppo sition of caste prejudice, and their social intercourse with these people will always be tolerably unrestricted. 71. However, taking facts as they are, it is necessary to bear in mind that Eastern Turkestan politics have to be dealt with in quite a different w T ay to Indian politics. 72. There were two principles on which we acted throughout the conduct of the mission and a strict adherence to which I consider had a material effect on its success. At starting the following order was issued to the members of the mission :— “ In all our dealings with natives, either in Cashmere or beyond the frontier of the Maharaja, no attempt at deception by any one member of the embassy can be allowed. The Yarkundis especially are very suspicious of anything like prevarication, or change of plan or opinion; our guiding principle should be that honesty is the best policy.” 73. The second rule was to transact all business direct with the Ameer’s responsible officials, and to allow my own Munshis no influence or power of interference whatever; not only were all representations, with rare exceptions, made either by myself personally or by some one or other of my officers especially deputed for the purpose, but no written communication from the Aineer or Syud or other person was allowed to be read in the first instance by any but myself or one of my officers ; in this way the danger from petty intrigue was avoided and our personal influence was fully secured. 74. The advantages to us in a military point of view of maintaining a thorough ententi cordiate with the people of Eastern Turkestan, and of preserving that country”from the possession of other European powers have been fully protrayed by Colonel Gordon in his military memorandum submitted herewith, and I need not enlarge on this branch of the subject. 75. And on the commercial advantages to be gained by opening out this country, I need not write in this confidential paper, the subject having been fully discussed in the general report. # 76. Passing out of the dominions of the Ameer of Kashgar, I now come to consider the information contained in Colonel Gordon’s and Captain Biddulph’s reports on the Pamir and Wakhan, and what has been supplied by Ressaidar Afzul Khan, Ibrahim Khan, and Abdul Subhan, natives attached to this mission, as well as what has been gathered from Syud Yakoob Khan and others. 77. We have from all these sources learned sundry geographical and political facts of considerable importance. 7S. In the first place, we now know that in taking the Oxus as a boundary, and speaking of its sources as a political point of demarcation, we have dealt with the subject in some degree of ignorance. Wood’s Lake was said to be the source, and Wakhan was dealt with as a province lying on the south-east of the Oxus. Now, however, it is clearly established that the Mmghab branch of the Oxus takes its rise m the Little Pamir Lake, called wrongly in the maps Burkut Yasseen, and Wakhan has villages on the north of the Panja stream which fl° ws f lorn Wood s Lake, in fact the road between Killa Punj and Wood’s Lake passes along the north bank of the river through Wakhan villages. 79. flhe piincipality of Shighnan extends over the Shewa Pamir or plain on the south side of the Oxus, and Bar Punja, its chief town, is on the left bank of the river. The Meer of Shighnan is sovereign also over the district of Roshan, which lies on the right bank of[ cli ] the Oxus with its capital at Wamar. The Meer ^ Roshan to his son, in the hope that whoever is rnaX,- nn g -a storm ^as made over kingdom from extinction. He has given one sisterTn ^ er 8,d ! h ? “** P«serve his another to Kashgar, and a third has been forced from him h ^ lhe Kllaa K °kand, also he has made presents of horses and skves! AMnl n'* AI T Kha, ‘- to whom raid this year on the Alai Pamir and carried off about ] 0 ( 11 ) , “ ’ au fV 8 that the Meer made a Naib Alum Khan, 200 to Kashgar, keepincftOe res t him w’ °L Wh,Ch , be sent «° *» plication in consequence* ° ’ P lu - tlle rest t»‘himself. There ,s likely to be com- 79A. Abdul Subhan reports that Roshan nnrl i family and subject to Badakshan, at least so far as ex7stino-t a ) WayS been p der one have been two brothers the elder generally rules in Shi^hnan ^ g0eS ‘ Where thei 'e The present Ruler of Shighnan, Yusuf Ali K mn wlmn t.T , 1 r S' y ° Unger in Eoshan - the British and Russian Governments, limtt““te territrv o/tl ^ * e ^ween Amur Darya, made over the whole of Roshan to 1,is voniTL 1 ^ 0t Cabul to tlle but whose rule is merely nominal, as the Meer visits the oomitrv q '?

Although no overtures have as vet been marta fn Tiwi i cn • i Ruler contemplates the possibility of abandoning to Badakshan hk vilkges on thf “eft bank of the Oxus, including Bar Punja, his chief town, and throwing himself into he hands of Bokhara and Russia. He knows that should he quarrel with Durwaz and Kokh the Ameer of Cabul could now give him no assistance, and he thinks he has more to hope and fear from the north than he has to fear from the south. 1 . will inevita % include the Roshan principality, and all the country not de clared to be Afghanistan, in her dominions, and it will be easy for her to push her claim so as to take possession of the Little Pamir Lake, and thus insert a very narrow wedo’e of 'ictm! Russian territory between Afghanistan and Kashgar. ° 81. Yasseen lies just on the other side of a comparatively low pass and offers an easy passage down to the Indus, and Kashmir has pushed her boundary westwards to within 40 or 50 miles of the Pamir. 82. So long as the mistaken idea was held that the Pamir was really the “roof” of the world and quite impassable for troops, it mattered little how far Kashmir penetrated in that direction, or who held the petty principalities on the Hindoo-Kush. But as the mists of igno rance are gradually being dissipated, we are brought face to face with facts and are compelled to acknowledge danger from a quarter whence we have a right to expect loyal assistance. 83. It is a fact, which is notorious, and of which we have had practical proof in the case of Abdul Subhan, that the Kashmir Government throws every obstacle in the way of our be coming acquainted with the country and people between Gilgit and the Hindoo-Kush, and her influence is exerted there against the interests of the British Government. 84. I may mention, quantum valeat, a piece of information given me by Faiz Buksh, that Ameer Shere Ali has been receiving moneys from the Maharaja secretly, for I presume that the sanction of the Government of India has not been obtained. I was given by Syud Yakoob Khan to understand that the secret friendship between Shere Ali and the Maharaja was not conducive to our interests. 85. The transactions of the Maharaja with the Chitral, Yasseen and other States are well known to the Government of India, and have been put before the public by Mr. Hayward, so that it is not necessary to allude to them further than for the purpose of drawing conclu sions. 86. From these facts, then, as well as from the outspoken words of warning given in Kashgar, I apprehend considerable trouble, if not actual danger to us from, this Gilgit quarter, unless we take steps to command that route. 87. On the military question, whether Russia would ever think of sending a force down by Kokand, or Kashgar, and the Pamir, and direct to the Indus, I do not offer an opinion; but that the road is far easier than was supposed, and that it presents none of the obstacles which would render the Karakorum route next to impossible Colonel Gordon s report shows. 88. But while the danger to India from actual invasion may be small, the evil of intri gues cannot be too carefully guarded against. There is a very different spirit abroad on our * Note.—T he circumstance of Captain Biddulph, being Aide-de-l amp to ians to attach undue importance to remarks on the subject made bj xm, an p . Review. Captain Biddulph’s communication was quite unofficial and made without my co e m . • He was act specially ordered to enquire into this particular matter, and subsequent enqumes throw a clearer glit on the true geographical and political position of Shighnan. , , « Captain Trotter was the responsible and scientific officer appointed Vakha!, received from me definite instructions to make proper geographical enqumes and to depute ibdul Subhan to visit Shighnan, and. if possible, Ivarakal. „ , . , T The information, to he given by Captain Trotter is, I believe, quite reliable, and that or wmci p esponsibility.frontier now tlian was borne 20, 10, or even 5 years ago. The conquest of Khiva and the rapid steady approach of Russia to the Oxus causes the natives of Afghanistan, and of the Punjab too, to reflect on the march of events. The general idea is that Russia is the rising power, that she is destined to advance still further, that England is afraid of her, and will do nothing to oppose her progress, or to help those who would preserve themselves from being swallowed up, consequently they consult as to the wisdom of making friends with the coming power. 89. The state of affairs in Cabul favors this line of policy. Shere Ali has quarrelled with his most popular son Yakoob Khan, and if that youth should, as is most probable, seek the aid of Russia, he will have the sympathies of more than half Shere Alfls kingdom. In the north Abdul Rahman from Samarcand keeps up his influence over Badakshan, and has an ad herent in the Ruler of Chitral. He also corresponds with the Maharaja of Kashmir, as I have already officially reported on the authority of Syud Yakoob Khan. If then Shere Ali finds his provinces on the north and south and west falling away to rivals wffio are under Russian influence, and if it be true that, the English allowance is so unpopular in Cabul, then it would not be a matter of surprise if, to save himself, he threw himself into the arms of Russia. I am now giving the view of the case as presented to me by Syud Yakoob Khan, which has received corroboration from the information brought by Ressaidar Afzul Khan, Ibrahim Khan, and by Abdul Subhan, all three of whom worked entirely separate and could not possibly have colluded in making their enquiries. All sources of information produce the same story, that Russian a cents have been over in Balkh, and Abdul Subhan says one has lately come to Cabul, and that Naib Alum Khan, the Ameer’s most trusted Lieutenant, openly expressed his pre ference for Russia, and that the talk of the people is, how they will get on with the Russians when they come. 90. The Afghans and people of Central Asia are not slow to appreciate facts, and as the contents of European newspapers find their way to Cabul, Balkh, and Kashgar, often in a dis torted and exaggerated form, there is no such thing as secrecy in political matters. 91. It does not escape their observation that not long ago an understanding as we call it, but a treaty [ahaclnamah) as it is universally believed and invariably described by them, was arrived at between England and Russia by which each party bound itself not to cross the Oxus. They know that we are adhering to our part of the compact, and that the Russians pay little or no heed to theirs. It is notorious in Kashgar, and I presume the same is known in Cabul, that however much the Emperor at St. Petersburg may issue orders to his officers, and mani festoes to the world, the local authorities act according to their own ideas of what is expedient. M. Berzenczey did not hesitate to say this openly in Yarkund. 92. The fact of seven British officers having passed an entire winter in Kashgar as the honored guests of the Ameer has been known throughout Asia. The refusal of the Ameer of Cabul to receive the British Embassy has also become known, and though the ostensible reason for this refusal is sufficiently plausible, the general belief amongst Asiatics is, that the Ameer has not put forward the true one, and at all events it is known that whilst he has 33 regiments at his disposal, any one of which would have amply sufficed to protect the embassy in its passage through the country, he declined to welcome our party. 93. He has received Russian agents, and whilst English merchants are not allowed to enter Afghan territory, Russian caravans are avowedly approaching Cabul—and it must be assumed with the knowledge and assent of the Ameer. Just at the same time too news come fiom Samarcand that the Russian Governor has ordered the Shikarpore merchants who frequent Bokhara for trade either to bring their families and settle there, or to quit the country altogether. 94. All these things and much more than is allowed to appear in the Cabul diaries are known to Indians and Afghans who are not slow to draw their own conclusions from passing events. 95. I fear the plain truth, however unpalatable, is, that our influence in Cahul is at pre sent not great, whereas Russian influence is decidedly increasing. 96. But our experience in Kashgar goes to show that British emissaries and British officers of sufficienc experience are sometimes well received across our frontier, and it appears to me to be advisable to seize the advantage thus offered to overcome the prejudice now exist- mg against us in Cabul, and to pmsh our influence to the furthest limits by acts of kindness and good offices to petty Chiefs in Badakshan and elsewhere. . ^’ Ressaidar Afzul Khan found the opinion in Badakshan to be strongly anti-Afghan, owing to the exactions of the Governor, and he heard many expressions of a desire for British interference.

In fact, it appears to me that the appointment of a British Resident at Kasho-ar is a step m advance, which, if unsupported by further action across the frontier, must prove in some sense a difficulty to us. Throughout Asia it must be regarded in the light of a chano-e of policy on the part of the British Government, and our representative must sink into a nonentity unless he is in a position to give advice upon current events when asked to do so. 103. I am well aware that if we judge of this question according to European and highly civilised ideas, there is much to be said in favor of having to deal with a Christian '’and European power with whom we can enter into satisfactory relations, though experience shows we cannot hind Russia by treaties; and there is something attractive in the idea of instructing Asiatics in European magnanimity and European love of justice. 104. But the rime has not yet arrived when we can afford to abandon entirely the old plan of treating orientals in oriental fashion ; and if we persist in shutting our eyes to Russians advances, we must at all events prepare ourselves for internal trouble. I know the idea is entertained by many, that were Russia to approach so near as to threaten India, the people of Hindostan would join our armies to one man. I cannot take such a sanguine view, and the whole of my experience with people on the frontier and across it forbids my indulging in a feeling of security. Simla, 21^ September 1874.The Jighits may be described as mounted infantry, every man having a horse which oa the march oarnes himself and all his belongs. They are able to° make lot Ind LiS marches and can keep up an average of 35 m.les a day for a great distance. In action hev dismount to fire a proportion being left in rear to hold the horses, but they have little drill or system among them. J u ur The Sirbazes have no horses; they are as a rule better armed than the Jiohits The two or three infantry corps that get more drill than the generality are among the Sirbazes. The Jighits and Sirbazes are distributed in small corps of from 200 to 500 men according to the estimation in which the commanders are held. The command of the Jemadar above mentioned was 500 men and four guns which he drilled all together, the guns beino placed in the company intervals; the movements were performed very slowly and precisely, on the pattern of thirty years ago; the words of command were apparently intended for English Another corps is commanded by a Daghestani Effendi who drills it in Constantinople fashion' A third corps is drilled by a Nogai Tartar on a Russian pattern. Besides these and the Chinese corps of Taifoorchees, other corps get no drill whatever, with the exception of target practice. The men are miserably armed, the greater number having only matchlocks fitted with a forked rest, others being heterogeneously armed with Cashmere made guns, old English sporting guns and rifles, mixed with a few Enfield rifles. Flint and steel guns are unknown. A few Enfield rifles were brought from India in 1870 by the Kashgar Envoy, and are now being copied in the AmeeCs workshops; the out-turn, however, is very small, not exceeding a hundred in the year, as the Osbegs have no turn for mechanical arts, and the arsenal work is entirely dependent on a few Hindostanees. Five hundred American repeating rifles were brought by the Ameer’s Envoy from Constantinople last year. Target shooting is much practised. Every town where there is a garrison has a number of rifle butts outside the gates, and the whole time of our stay in Kashgar target practice was going on four times a week : it is not, however, conducted on any system; matchlocks, Enfield rifles, and double-barrelled guns, all being used at the same range together. Lead, sulphur, and saltpetre are very plentiful, the powder made is good, and the dry nature of the climate is favourable to its preserving its quality long; it is made by each corps commander, who gets an allowances of pay for making it for practice: the Ameer’s work shops making powder for use on service. Percussion caps which are in great demand are imported from Hindostan. The Ameer keeps the management of the army entirely in his own hands. Four officers exercise authority under him, Jemadar Nubbee Bux, the Punjabee abovementioned, Dadkhwah Hajji Beg, a native of Badakshan, and the Ameer’s sons, Beg Kuli Beg and Hukk Kuli Beg. In time of peace two of them reside at Kashgar, one at Yarkund, and one at Aksu. The other ranks are in succession as follows :— Pansudbashee (Commander of 500.) Omra. Yawur (Artillery). Lawur (Infantry). Yuzbashee (Commander of 100.) The Pansudbashees and Omras of the higher grade are employed on special duties in peace time, the commands of corps being held by Lavvurs. The ranks contain a great mixture of nationalities: natives of the count! y,Andijanees, Caskmerees, Hindostanees, Afghans, Chinese, Toorganees, Calmaks, Wakhees and Kunjootee . The Kashgarees are themselves much averse to military service, but remarkably unwarlike; there is consequently much difficu ty oum in p 7, f, 1T ’ therefore all vagabonds and men unable to give a good account of other countries that have fallen into poverty, prisoners taken in war, essed j ^ t | le merchants and released by the Ameer on condition of military service, a,e piessed ranks.

One man described them to me as “ men who would stand up and be fired at, without returning a shot, if ordered.” Details that come under the head of interior economy are badly looked after, and there is Consequently much general discontent. I was told that during the recent fighting at Orumchi and Manass, upwards of 400 men deserted to Russian territory on account of the hardships they had to undergo. The pay is small, and on no fixed scale, each man's pay being fixed independently, and among the private soldiers not exceeding 100 tangas a year. A tanga equals about five pence English money. Clothing and food are provided by the State. The country contains very great resources of food and carriage, the former is cheap and plentiful; enormous flocks of sheep and cattle are kept by the nomad tribes in the mountains. At Aksu a sheep sells for 4^ tangas, and 20lbs. rice sell for 1 tanga. At Yarkund a sheep costs 10 or 12 tangas, 20 lbs. rice sell at 2 to 3 tangas, 801bs. of wheat flour sell for 5 tangas, Indian-corn or maize sells at 40 lbs. for 1 tanga, while large tracts of fertile land are unculti vated for want of population. Horses, camels, donkeys, and bullocks for carrying burdens exist in great quantities. The horses of the country are excellent animals, powerful, hardy, and enduring, averaging 14 hands in height, and much resembling Welsh ponies in appearance. They carr^ a load of 2501bs, with ease. The best are bred by the Calmaks near Karashahr. The camels are of the double humped kind, very powerful animals, carrying a 4801bs. load, and capable of standing great extremes of heat and cold. The best come from Khoten. The donkeys of the country carrv a load of 150 lbs. Carts of good construction are also freely used in the traffic of the country; they are drawn by four horses and carr) 1,800 lbs. weight, and travel at a rate of three miles an hour on the unmetalled road. The only fortified places in the country that I visited are Kashgar, Yarkund, Yengi Hissar and Maralbashi. The system followed at each place is the same, the fort being built entirely apart from the town and at some distance from it. At Kashgar the fort of Yengi Shahr, as it is called, is situated 4| miles to the south-east of the town. It was built by the Chinese 40 years ago, and consists of an earthen rampart 25 feet thick and 30 feet high in the shape of a rude rectangle with the angles rounded off, ,and is about 1,000 yards each way. At every 50 yards are square bastions projecting about 25 feet. There is but one gateway in the centre of the north-west face, covered by a barbican projecting 150 feet from the rampart, and not accessible to direct fire. Outside the rampart is a wall five feet high and three feet thick forming a kind of covered way. The whole is surrounded by a dry ditch 20 feet wide. The town of Kashgar is surrounded by an earthen rampart 25 feet thick and 30 feet high, with small square towers projecting about 10 feet, at irregular intervals. The ditch is filled in, in many places, and no attempts seem made to keep the whole in repair. The city has three gates, to the north, south and east. The fort at Yarkund is situated on the west side of the city, and 500 yards from it; it has only one gateway, looking towards the city, and is built in exactly the same way as the fort of Kashgar. The angles are not rounded off, and it is about 700 yards by 800 yards in extent. It has an inner reduit built against the rampart on the northern side. The city of Yarkund has five gates, and is covered on the east side by a large swamp The city rampart is of the same description and in the same state as that of the city of Kashgar, and it has no ditch. The fort of Maralbashi is built in exactly the same manner as the forts of Yarkund and Kashgar: it is however smaller. It is situated at the point of junction of the Kashgar road with the road from Yarkund to Aksu. The river Kizzil flows under the walls of the fort and was made use of by being dammed up and turned on to the fort to break down the rampart during the late rebellion against the Chinese. The fort at Yengi Hissar is quite new, having been built within the last two years, and is altogether of better construction than those above-mentioned. It is built in form of a rectangle 200 yards by 260 yards, with an hexagonal tower projecting 30 feet at each .angle: small square bastions project at every 60 yards, and one large square bastion projects some 45 feet in the middle of the south face covering the gateway. The profile is the same as in the other forts, except that the main rampart is only 15 feet high, and the outer wall or covered way has circular places d armes, at intervals of 80 or 90 yards, flankiup 1 the main ditch, which is 6.0 feet wide and 30 feet deep.[ clyii ] The town has no defences : the buildino-c! nr,™™™™ i. , the east side of the fort at 400 yards distance is a W %° U • ° ^ ar( ^ s . ^ rorn the fort.

(Sd.) T. D. F.APPENDIX XVII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE MISSION OF SYUD YAKOOB KHAN TURRAH TO RUSSIA IN THE WINTER OF 1875-76, COMPILED FROM NOTES TAKEN OF CONVERSATIONS WI'IH THE ENVOY, BY CAPTAIN E. MOLLOY, BENUAL STAFF CORPS, ASSISTED BY MALIK KUTBUDDIN, TAHSILDAR. [Referred to in paragraph 116 ; Chapter V.~] It may not be considered out of place to preface this narrative by a few remarks that may throw a little light on the reasons that induced the Ameer of Kashgar to send Syud Yakoob Khan on this mission to St. Petersburg. The line of policy that had led him to conclude a commercial treaty with the British Gov ernment, and to proclaim the Kingdom he governs to be feudatory to the suzerainty of the Porte, would hardly be considered favorable to securing him the good-will of a power so jealous of supremacy in Central Asia as Russia has shewn herself to be. Were the Ameer in a position to choose his friends, Russia would probably be very little troubled by any amicable overtures from him, but situated as he is, he must have long ere this realised the importance of securing the good-will of a power on whose forbearance the preserva tion of the integrity of his kingdom may be said to depend entirely. Had he indeed in his endeavors to cultivate friendly relations with the British Government been supported by a coalition of the other States of Central Asia, he might have found him self in a position to face the contingency &lt;-f Russian hostility, but so far from this, at the verv time he had welcomed an English Embassy to his country and done, as every member of it has borne witness, everything in his power to render t ieir stay in it agreeable, he heard that the Ameer of Cabul had actually refused this same mission a safe conduct through his territory on their way back to India. An occurrence of this sort must naturally have had its weight with the Ameer wh°n he came to reflect on the advantages he would be likely to derive from our alliance, and whatever conclusion he may have come to on the matter, it can hardly have raised his opinion of our prestige in Central Asia, or emboldened him to act independently of Russian opinion : on the contrary, it is more likely to have added additional force to the misgivings entertained by him of the intentions of the Czar’s Government, and the view they might be inclined to take of his recent negociations with the British Government, and considering the position of the two countries, and the way Yarkund is strategically menaced by attack from Russia, it is not surprising that the Ameer should have considerable dread of arousing the enmity of a foe that has already, during its steady advance in Central Asia, so often shewn itself only too ready to pick a quarrel with any State whose territory would add to its aggrandizement. • The disturbances that eventually led to the annexation of Khokand were at this time just breaking out, and must have been an additional cause of anxiety to the Ameer, as he was constantly receiving messages from Khuda Yar Khan and others of these Ministers of the State, begging his assistance and interference in the affairs of the Khanate. Fortunately he was wise enough to turn a deaf ear to these requests, and to carefully refrain from giving the revolt any countenance whatever, for even as it was, the Russian Gov ernment seem to have done their best to implicate him in it with a view to making a pretext for declaring war against him. In fact, one of the main reasons for his sending Syud Yakoob Khan on this embassage was no doubt to clear himself from any suspicion of having participated in the Khokand revolt; ostensibly the Envoy was deputed to convey the congratulations of the Ameer on the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh with the daughter of the Czar, but in addition to this, and the object above noted, his instructions seem to have been to collect as much information as possi ble as to the power and resources of the Russians in Central Asia, to impress the authorities with the desire of the Ameer to keep on good terms with their Government, and to sound the views held by them as to the question of the establishment of a Russian Agency in Kashgar. It is difficult to find out the exact extent to which the Ameer empowered his Envoy to act with reference to this last question. I infer that although he may have authorised him to arrange the appointment of an Agent, should the Russian Government pre«s the matter very urgently, it was still a contingency the Ameer was most anxious to avoid if possible. As will appear in the narrative, Syud Yakoob Khan seems on all occasions when the question was brought up by the representatives of the Russian Government with whom he had interviews, to have carefully explained that whilst he was desirous of ascertaining their wishes on the loafinepresenei '■sfiiteaEiiropeai i| ' Hell always sb IinM mainly th ^Government a Ifflin* Yarkunc ylbtastaym tl *; Wd» his stay i sfera a good di sled himself mi pe the idea; ‘(trip to Englani Igoatieff wo statility of Rnssii •stiag the oountr ‘ tint ^r&amp;ig to the t* same terms of J to have los furies of one tracts, and[ clix ] point, he was not empowered by his master to actually amnc™ w , i r i.

In this matter it may be mentioned here, the Envoy was successful, for after an interview with General Kaufmann at Chemket he obtained the release of the giri * To visit Russia, however, was not the sole object of the Envoy's mission • it was -dso contemplated that he should take India, Turkey, and England ** route to the Russian capital. Since the declaration by the Ameer of Kashgar of the suzerainty of the Porte over the territory he governs, he has never lost an opportunity of shewing his fealty to the Sultan • he now coins in his name, and has strictly enjoined the reading of the khutba in his name in every mosque in Eastern Turkistan, and in sending any mission from Yarkund, he appears to regard it of the first importance that a visit should be paid to Constantinople, and certain offerings “nazzars” be presented for the acceptance of the Sultan. It was intended that the Envoy should go on from Turkey to England, but this visit never came off, chiefly, 1 have been given to understand, because he was so long delayed in Constantinople settling his business with the Sultan that the time his arrival in England had been looked for had long passed, and it was in consequence considered desirable that his visit should be postponed for another year and a more suitable season. It may be worth while to say here a word about Syud Yakoob Khan Turrah, the Envoy selected by the Ameer to undertake this very important mission. Of a family that commands great influence in Central Asia, from tne fact of its possessing as a direct ancestor the celebrated Shah Ali Hamidan, a saint who flourished about 300 years ago and died at Kliatlan on the Jaxartes after having obtained an almost world-wide reputation, Syud Yakoob Khan is a man of intelligence and ability. To a fine presence be adds remarkably pleasing manners which have received of late years quite a European polish. He has always shewn himself to be a well-wisher of the British Government, and it has been indeed mainly through his efforts that the friendly relations that now subsist between the British Government and Yarkund have been brought about. Leaving Yarkund late in the autumn of 1874, the Envoy reached India in the winter, and after a short stay in the country went on to Constantinople early in 1875. During his stay in that city, which was prolonged over some months, he seems to have been thrown a good deal in the society of General Ignatieff, the Russian Ambassador, who interested himself much about the Envoy's proposed journey to Russia, doing bis best to encourage the idea; whilst at the same time rather throwing cold water on the advantages of the trip to England. In fact, Syud Yakoob Khan has repeatedly spoken to me of the way General Ignatieff would dilate to him of the dangers that Yarkund would be exposed to from the hostility of Russia, and consequently of the advisability of his carrying out his intention of visiting the country, and doing everything in his power to gain the good-will ot the Government. According to the Envoy, the Russian Ambassador does not. seem to have spoken in at all the same terms of the desirability or utility of the British alliance to ai un , u , on le contrary, to have lost no opportunity of slighting it, pointing out t e istance a separa es the territories of one country from the other, the difficulty of traversing 16 ^ » mountain tracts, and the consequent improbability of the friendship o le n ia ment being of any advantage to the Ameer. / The intimacy that thus sprang up between them was not altogether to the Envoy, for although he sj.efks very well of the soc.al to Ae especially of those of his wife, who appears to have shewn giea ' u ' , , t Envoy, ho describes there having been something about t le j m as desire for his confidence in his honesty. Moreover, the overt way h .^ ^fA^lYe Turkish Mini' interviews with the Envoy seems to have g 1Te “ ' se ^^Xve realfsed that he was in a ters as to the cause of so much intimacy. . Ine.byuc + , found verv little favor difficult position, for he was aware that his projected mission ^ ^ n^rtino- him in the eyes of the Sultan ; * A full account is given of this in the main object of the Syud’s journey to never have gone all the way round to St. Governor-General of Turkestan. nXYke' t hat he had consideralffe trouble in getting him Schuyler's Turkestan, Vo&gt;. 1 p^e, 99 m-d it » TwS &gt; “ 1 “.Ser' wS’oui;- required the orders of the Petersbur&lt;[ clx ] to acquiesce in it, and probably would not have succeeded in doing so at all, had it not been for the private business above alluded to, which he laid great stress upon as being a matter the Ameer had given him evey strict injunctions about. At last, however, matters were arranged and the necessary rukhsat or permission to depart obtained from the Sultan; through the instrumentality of General Ignatieff a telegraphic message had been received from the Czar expressive of his pleasure at the projected visit of the Kashgar Envoy, so that everything promised well for its success. Starting from Constantinople about the end of August 1875, the Envoy reached Odessa after a journey by steam-boat of some 48 hours. On his arrival he was met by a Russian official who conducted him to a comfortable house that had been prepared for his reception. With this official was a Russian officer who introduced himself as Captain Nicolai, and inform ed the Envoy that he had been appointed under the orders of Government to attend upon him during his travels through Russian territory. This he did, only bidding adieu to the Envoy on his reaching the borders of his own country again. Unfortunately, however, Cap tain Nicolai spoke no language the Envoy understood, and all conversation between them had to be carried on through the medium of an interpreter, which was a hindrance to their being able to get on intimate terms with each other. The day succeeding his arrival in Odessa the Governor of the town paid the Envoy a ceremonial visit, it did not last long, the Governor confining his remarks to bidding the Envoy a cordial welcome to Russia and expressing a hope that he would enjoy his projected tour through the country, etc., etc., to which the Envoy replied in appropriate terms. As his stay in Odessa extended over no more than three days, the Envoy had not much time for going about and examining the town. He describes it as fine and large, with very broad streets, which struck him as adding much to the appearance of the place, the population he states to be very mixed, the oriental element being represented with many other European nationalities. The town itself is situated on rising ground, on the highest point of which is a fort commanding the country about. Inquiries elicited the information that the whole of the fortifications of the place have recently been much strengthened and improved, some large Knip guns have been mounted on the fort itself. The town the Envoy speaks of as having a busy air and containing a considerable mercantile population, large quantities of all kinds of goods being exposed for sale in the streets. During the Envoy's stay a considerable body of troops passed through the town, and he says he passed several trains full of troops on his way to Moscow. He was informed that all these men were going to the Turkish frontier to be ready to act as occasion might require in the revolt that had a short time before this broken out in the provinces of Servia and Herzegovina against the Turkish rule. Apropos of which the Envoy remarked to me—“ Soon after my arrival in Russia I found out that there was a very prevalent idea that the Ameer of Kashgar was abetting the people of Khokand in their revolt against the Russian rule, the Emperor when he heard the report, became so wroth that he would have liked to declare war against Yarkund at once, and taken the country, and yet notwithstanding all this indignation at the idea of a revolt against his own rule, he has no hesitation in sending his own troops to aid the Servians in their revolt against the Turkish rule; indeed it is reported in Yarkund now that the Russians are secretly aiding the Chinese army that is threatening the Ameer's dominions, and that large stores of grain of which they stood in great need have been sent to them from the Russian settlement of Almaty (Fort Vernoe).' “ This you see,' he went on to say, “is the return the Ameer gets for having repeatedly refused to aid the Khokandians in their rebellion.'* After a rest of three days in Odessa, the Envoy started on his travels again to Moscow, the journey took about seventy hours’ continuous travelling, and the cold as Moscow was approached became very perceptibly severer. On the journey the Envoy made the following remarks : “ On leaving Odessa we passed a low range of hills which are connected with the high ground on which the fort is situated, other hills were also occasionally visible, though, as a rule, the country seemed to me flat and uninteresting. Cultivation did not strike me as being abundant, though now and again I. saw some good crops, chiefly of wheat and barley. I noticed very few villages along the road, and the number of passengers that got in and out of the train at the various stations we passed by struck me particularly as being much fewer than those one sees on Indian Railways.'^ On his arrival in Moscow the Envoy was met at the station by some of the Government officials and escorted to a residence that had been prepared for him. As he was informed * ibere can be little doubt of tbe truth of what the Syud says here about the Ameer having been repeatedly tagged to join the revolt in Khokand, indeed his assistance has been sought for from more distant places than Khokand; Schuyler says in his Turkestan, Vol. 2, page 255—“In a communication which I received from an influential Kashgarian official, it was stated that Yakoob Khan was constantly receiving petitions from the inhabitants of Tashkend and other Russian towns urging him to invade the country and relieve them from the Russian yoke.” |imver myself s ,lw lad repeat «M His Maj ; : ::«lere.

To continue the account of the interview in the Envoys own words— The room was empty on my entering it, hut as soon as I had walked about half wav up it three persons appeared from a door at the top. One of these was pointed out to me as the Emperor, and another as General Milutin, the War Minister. The Emperor received me standing, and in this attitude all of us remained while the interview lasted. After acknow ledging my salaam, without making any of the usual enquiries as to health, &amp;c., which in my country are considered such a strict point of etiquette on such occasions as these, the Emperor abruptly addressed me in the following terms: ‘ I have just received a telegram from Tash- kend informing me that the Ameer of Kashgar has been sending troops to assist the people of Khokand in their rebellion against the Russian rule, and I do not understand with what object he has sent you here/ This speech so took me aback that a few moments elapsed before I could recover myself sufficiently to reply to it, then I explained to the best of my power that the report must be false, for 1 was well aware that, so far from having joined in the rebellion the Ameer had repeatedly refused to give it any countenance at all, that whatever news mio’ht have reached His Majesty now, the truth must come put later and that meantime he could keep me here. I pointed out, too the extreme unlikelihood of the Ameer’s having sent me on this friendly mission had he entertained any idea of joining in the Kokandian revolt. This explanation seemed to afford the Emperor some satisfaction, for he said with a smile after I had finished it: ‘ This gentlemen/ pointing to the Interpreter, * has my orders to attend upon you during your stay in my capital, and I trust that yon will find nothing wanting to render your visit an agreeable one.’ Thanking him for his kindness, I explained that the main object of the Ameer in sending me to Russia was to congratulate His Majesty on the marriage of his daughter with a son of the Queen of England. After a few more speeches of a purely formal character I took my leave. “ Before quitting the palace I was taken to another room where some refreshments were offered to me ; among other things on the table was some delicious fruit.” On returning home the Envoy was informed that the Emperor had received that very morning a telegram from General Kaufmann conveying the news that the Ameer of Kashgar had been sending assistance to the Khokandians, and that he was very much disturbed by the information. “The Inter preter who was attending upon me,” said the Envoy, “ more than once asked me if there were any truth in the news, but I assured him as confidently as I could that there was none at all, and that the Ameer had much too great a desire to preserve the integrity of his kingdom to commit himself so far highly as to arouse the vengeance of the Russians. Within a week the Envoy’s words received confirmation, for the Emperor got a second telegram from General Kaufmann which exculpated the Ameer from any participation in the revolt. After this the Envoy says he noticed that his hosts treated him in a much more friendly and pleasant manner. He had no second interview wifh the Czar, who very shotHy after e t St. Petersburg for the Crimea; the Envoy, however, remarked apropos oi this that he was not at all sorry not to see the Emperor again, as the one interview he had impressed him most unfavorably. The Envoy describes the appearance of the Czar as being most unprepossessing and his manner as being cold and haughty, so that it was impossible to feel m any way at ease when talking to him. A day or two after the departure of the Emperor the Envoy paid his respects to his brother, the Gravel Duke Nicolas, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, who received him great kindness and affability. He also saw the Grand Dnke Waldem.r, the younger brother or the (Witch, who was described as a fine-looking young man, with very great contrast in this respect to his father. These interyievvs were a Ufa purely foimal character, but intimation was now conveyed to the Envoy that to JlMilutin wished to see him on business. General Milutin, the Envoy says, is considered one of the highest dignitaries of the Russian Government, and Ins reception of the Envoy was charac terised by a good deal of pomp and ceremony, which was probably due to the fact that the inter view, as the War Minister informed the Envoy, was held by the command of the Gzar. The Envoy thus relates what took place during it: “ The War Minister, after a few preliminary formalities, commenced conversation by asking me about the revolt in Kokand, and wiiat in my opinion had given rise to it. I replied that for some time past the people of Khokand had been discontened with the rule of Khuda Yar Khan, but that of late years the tyranny and oppression of his rule had increased so much as to render it impossible to live under it, and that this no doubt had driven his subjects to revolt; at the same time I added that I hoped they mio-ht be left to settle their own troubles themselves, and that the Russian Government world not deem it necessary to interfere in the matter. To this General Milutin replied ‘ that the interference of the Russian Government had been expressly solicited by Khuda Yar Khan, who had shown himself to be utterly unable to settle the affairs of the Khanate himself, that all the Russian Government desired was to get order and quiet restored in the country, and that if the people showed themselves willing to live amicably under any of their own rulers they would be permitted to do so, but at present it did not look very promising that such would be the case ; to which I replied that 1 hoped at any rate they might get a fair trial. “ After this our conversation came incidentally upon the English policy with regard to Yarkund. General Milutin questioning me particularly about the way Indian Government appeared to be opening out roads through Kashmir and Ladak, and enquiring how far they • had reached, and whether they were broad enough for laden horses, carts, &amp;c. I told him that old roads had been repaired and improved, but that, as far as I knew, no new ones had been made, that the improvements were much approved of by traders in offering them greater facilities for the transport of their goods from one country to another. On this the War Minister remarked that he would advise me to dissuade the Ameer from letting the communi cations to his country be opened out too much, as the English were notorious for making good roads to a country first and then annexing it. I replied that the Ameer looked on the English as his friends, and that he had not the least fear of their annexing Yarkund. “ Changing the conversation now General Milutin commenced talking of the desire of the Emperor to maintain friendly relations with Yarkund, and that one of the best means to ensure this would be for each Government to appoint an Agent to reside in the capital of the other, and he went on to suggest my remaining for this purpose in St. Petersburg. In reply to which I said that a matter of this kind required a good deal of deliberation, and that although I had every reason to believe the Ameer would look on it favorably, still I have no authority for carrying it out at once, but that I would advocate it on my return to Yarkund. Here General Milutin instanced the case of a Russian trader who had gone to Kashgar with a caravan of goods, whi«h on arrival there he had been compelled to sell at very unremunerative rates, add ing that such a thing could never occur if the Russian Government had an Agent in the country to protect the interests of its traders. In reply to this remark I explained that there had been some mistake about the sale of this merchants goods, but it was never intended that he should sustain loss, as was shown by the readiness with which the Ameer had granted compensation to him since.* “ General Milutin here spoke of the recent mission of Colonel Reinthall to Kashgar, saying that he had left the country anything but pleased at the treatment he had received at the Ameeris hands. Hce again I endeavoured to exculpate to the best of my ability the con duct of the Ameer, explaining that every country had its own form of etiquette, and that in Yarkund they were very particular in adhering to the forms prevalent there. That if Colonel Reinthall had met with any treatment that annoyed him, it was probably due to his ignorance of the manners and customs of the country, and a disinclination to adapt himself to them, but that I could not believe any slight had intentionally been put upon him.f “I here took the opportunity of mentioning the private business the Ameer had commis sioned me to settle, to which General Milutin said that he would write to General Kaufmann, the Governor-General of Turkestan, on the matter, and that on my seeing him I should no doubt be abfi; to arrange what I wanted. “ Shortly after this I took my leave; in bidding me good-bye the War Minister asked me to attend a review of the troops in St. Petersburg one day, which I agreed to do, but when the review came off, it was such an unfavorable day that I declined attending it.” * The case alluded to here is that of a caravan of goods sent to Yarkund in 1873 by a M. Pujiyshef; the goods were mostly bought up by the Ameer himself, in order that the Russian merchant might have no excuse for travelling over other parts of the country as a pretext for the sale of his goods. Payment was made too for the things pur chased by the Ameer at forced rates, which M. Pupyshef declared to be much below the market value of the goods; ultimately the Russian Government compelled the Ameer to re-imburse M. Pupyshef on this account to the extent of 12,000 roubes. t Colonel Reinthall went to Yarkund in 1874 after the mission of Sir Douglas Forsyth, expressly to arrange for the appointment of a Russian Consul in Kashgar, but it is said that the Ameer never gave him a chance of bringing up the subject, and that in consequence he left the country much annoyed, vide Schuyler’s Turkestan, Yol. JL, page 324,[ clxiii ] time testates lie was treated months, during which him to go about and see some sights other, o^the?^^ wf Envoy describes as being much severer than anvthinoAp ^ °j . ie which the disinclined to leave the house oftener thai he was obhged CX P''™ n “ d “ Yarkund, he felt The Envoy appears to have been a good deal struck with the beauty of St. Petersburo taMin^r as a most symmetrically laid out town with some very fine streets aifd The latter he says are chiefly built of red brick in the best part of the town and of wood the more remote, and many of them are of considerable height. The variety and r ehTess of he shops too seems to have astonished him a good deal, but he noticed that a great pro portion of them were owned by foreigners, chiefly Frenchmen, and especially those where fi e- arms were sold, which do not seem to be extensively manufactured in Russia. The Russian troops, he heard, have been recently armed with some American repeating rifle, though its distribution would not seem to have been carried out throughout the army as yet. With reference to the army the Envoy made the following remarks : “ The total strength of the Russian army is said to be more than a million men; but the extent of country it has to protect is so enormous that even this amount cannot leave them many men to spare The army of the Caucasus, which is said to number about 150,000 men, is said to be in a very efficient state, there is also reported to be a strong force in the Crimea, of course havino* seen nothing of these armies I can only speak from hearsay, the army of Turkestan, however, which I did see something of, appeared to me to be very weak in numbers indeed, and the men did not seem to me to be nearly so well drilled as the troops of the British Government I saw in India, its success I attribute entirely to the want of unanimity which has unfortunately always characterised,the policy of the different States that it has attacked in Central Asia, but I am convinced that were.they to unite, the Russians could not hold the country with the army that is at present occupying Turkestan.” During his stay in St. Peterburg the Envoy made an interesting excursion to Krondstadt, he was shown over all the fortifications of the harbour which he describes as being of immense strength. He was also taken over an armour-plated turret ship which it was evidently expected would astonish him a good deal; but he told the officers who were showing him over it, that he had seen two or three ships of this kind belonging to the English in the Bombay harbour, and some more belonging to the Turks at Constantinople, in order that they might understand that it was not quite a novel sight to him to see a turret ship. After his interview with General Milutin, the War Minister, the Envoy had one with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose name however he has unfortunately been unable to give me. The following is the Envoy’s account of this interview :— “The Minister commenced conversation by speaking about the way the Russian Govern ment was endeavouring to open out railway communication along the Turkestan frontier, which he hoped might, in the coarse of a few years, reach as far as Tashkand. At present I may say that the Turkestan railway is not constructed beyond Sydran, on the Volga, .which river is now being bridged, but the bridge when I saw it, a month or so after this, was in a very un advanced state of construction, and they were only just commencing to lay out the railway beyond it, so that I should think it would take a long time before it reaches iashkand. Talking of the revolt in Kokand, the Minister spoke of the discontent of the people at the rule of Khuda Yar Khan, and their anxiety to exchange it for that of Russia, to which I replied that no doubt the tyranny of Khuda Yar Khan had created great discontent amongst his subjects, hut that all the same I trusted that the annexation of the country by Russia might not be decided on too bastilv, as things might improve if the peop e weie e o nt a better ruler than their late one,'who alone was responsible for the present disorder, lo this the Minister replied that it was not so easy a matter to find good rulers m Cential Asia, and he hinted that there were a good , many reports current about e yiannjr o i Kashgar. To which I replied that it was the aim.of the Ameei 0 ^ i ing to the precepts of the Koran, in which everything is laid town a i is to do, and that so long as he kept to these principles, no one could accuse him of ty y. The threatened invasion of Yarkund^y the Chinese novv formed the topic of ^ sation, the Minister asking me my opinion as to the resources o e , 63 j n rep iy army, and the chance of his being able to encounter t e j liuese ^ ij i iave n0 trouble in to which I said that if the Chinese got no help elsewheie, e . m&lt; h , j • Yarkund that keeping them out of his country, and added that it was cuiren y q ^ Eastern the Chinese intended occupying “Hi” again befoie a em P . ^ .i v ; nce 0 f Turkestan. To tins the Minister said that the temporary oceupat on of the bufc was forced upon the Russian Government by circums anccs ov j when- that the Chinese Government had been informed that it would beiestoied a 0 amever they might send a sufficient force to hold the province in proper order, and that mean time its revenue was not nearly paying the Russian Government the expenses of occupation.* Shortly after this I took leave of the Minister; before letting me go, however, he made me over the following presents from the Emperor:—“ For the Ameer a jewelled watch valued at Rupees 3,000, a sword with a jewelled handle, and a telescope, and for myself a watch, two pistols, a double-barrelled gun, and an embroidered rope. I also received about Rupees 5,000 in cash as an allowance for the defrayment of my personal expenses while in St. Petersburg/' Among other people the Envoy met at St. Petersburg, he mentions a Mons. Bozilipska, the Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom he talks of in the warmest terms as being one of the kindest of men. He paid the Envoy several visits, and several times enter tained him in his own house, when he met Madame Bozilipska, whom he also describes as a particularly agreeable and pleasant person. On his leaving St. Petersburg, she gave him a very handsome photographic album with likenesses of herself and family. Mons. Bozilipska informed the Envoy that he was a great traveller, having visited the greater part of Europe, Turkey, and also Persia, the language of the latter country he spoke, the Envoy says, with considerable fluency. He took much interest in trade, and questioned the Envoy a good deal about the resources of Eastern Turkestan in this respect, expressing a desire of visiting the country himself with a view to seeing its capabilities. The Envoy also met Mr. Eugene Schuyler of the American Embassage to St. Peters burg. He had just returned from a long journey through Turkestan. The Envoy says that he spoke with great freedom of what he had seen during his travels, telling him that he intended to publish a book about them. “ He put me a great many questions;'' the Envov in describing the interview went on to say “ about the system of land tenure in Central Asia, saying that the plan the Russian Government wus introducing of State appropriation of the soil appeared to be giving rise to great discontent in the country, to which I remarked that in many cases the owners of the soil were not even recognized as tenants, their lands being taken absolute possession of by Government. On this point I said I was a sufferer myself; some pro perty in the vicinity of Tashkand which has for years past been in the possession of my family having been recently illegally confiscated by Government; but that I intended on my way through Tashkand to bring the matter to the notice of General Kaufmann as I was in a posi tion to substantiate my claim to the property by the production of title-deeds, but that all the same I had not much hope of getting justice done me, as General Kaufmann had shown him self to be a very hard man in his dealings with Muhammadans. To which Mr. Schuyler replied that he had heard some stories of this kind in Turkestan himself, but that he thought it likely that matters might improve soon as he had reason to believe that the whole question of land tenure was about to receive the attention of the Government at St. Petersburg, and that orders would probably issue putting matters on a better footing’, and restricting the license local administrators appeared at present to be allowed in the settlement of newly-acquired districts. He went on to say that he had seen a great many things in connexion with the Russian rule of the country that have greatly shocked him, and which were quite enough to account for there being great discontent in the country.'' Apropos of which remarks the Envoy said to me that he was very glad to hear Mr. Schuyler speak like this, for being a dis interested person he could have no object in making matters worse than they are, so that what he said to me about the Russian rule should be taken as the truth. Arrangements for his onward journey having been by this time completed, the Envoy left St. Petersburg for Moscow 7 on the 5th November 1875. The cold he experienced on the road he describes as something that even a Yarkund winter could in no way compare with : it was most intense between Moscow and Orenburg, where the discomforts of the journey rendered it most trying to endure. Captain Barnaby gives a very good idea of what the cold in this part of the world must be in the interesting account he has published of his ride to Khiva. The Envoy this time stayed only one day in Moscow. Erom Moscow to Sydran, or Sizeran as it is generally written, about 18 hours by rail, the Envoy describes Sydran as a small town with a mixed population, consisting chiefly of Russian Cossacks, Noghais, with a sprinkling of traders from Central Asia. The towm is situated on the Volga, and is the terminal point of the railroad from Moscow, which is, however, e Envoy says, being laid down beyond the river in the direction of Orenburg, though as ^ , e P * l ’°» iess ^ as b 0611 made towards its completion. The Volga is also being budged here, but this work must also be in a very unadvanced state. Schuyler in his luikestau, Vol. II, pp. 188-189, gives the following information about the occupation of “ Hi”:— Tw at S ,-' i P f te, : sb ’ ir S' w ere not overpleased at the occupation of the new territory. * * * * 1 he Foreign Office immediately informed the Chinese Government of the occupation of the province, and declared JJZril !: 0 r G t0 / e kV- 0 P lina whenever a sufficient force could be brought there to hold it against attacks and to remains undec'ided°” U HS ^ n °^ ^ ee11 (bine &gt; an d the question of the permanent occupation of the province still42 [ clxv ] Sydran to Orenburg, about a week's journey by post TWmul a t travelling has to be done, as in some parts oil India, in carriage with relays oil i mt ho’'’ 07 VI the vehicles used on tins route to Turkestan he describes as being not nearly so comZteble L those that are to be found m India, nor are they so well-horsed. It is customary for traveller to purchase their carnages winch are not to he got on hire, as in India; horses however Ire let out on hire at the different stages along the road. The country beyond Sydran the Envoy describes as being fairly cultivated up to about half-way to Orenburg, after which it become! decidedly more barren. The road is rough and in bad order, and at the time the Envoy rassed over it snow was lying some two or three feet deep on the ground, which made travellino- very difficult, more than once the carriages of the party got stuck in a snow drip and their extri cation was a work involving considerable trouble and delay. At intervals along the road are rest houses for the use of travellers, where the horses are changed, &amp;c. The accommodation provided in them is however, the Envoy says, of the most meagre description, offering a great contrast to the comfort of the dak bungalows in India • in fact, he found the rest-houses on this line so uncomfortable that he says he only stopped in them when compelled to from fatigue. After leaving Sydran the road passes over a succes sion of low hills, in crossing which the Envoy says he suffered much inconvenience from the jolting of the vehicle he was travelling in; the only place worthy of the name of a town passed on the road is “ Samara/' where there is a good bazaar fairly well stocked with merchandise. Orenburg the Envoy describes as a good sized town, that has been of late years improved by some fine buildings the Russians have recently erected in it. The population is numerous and mixed, and men from all parts of Central Asia are to be seen in the streets. The hussians are said to be endeavouring to introduce a system of national education in Orenburg, and have built several schools for the purpose, but their endeavors would seem hitherto to have met with very little success. The Envoy says that the trade of Orenburg must be considerable, large caravans of goods periodically coming into the town from Khiva, Bokhara, and many other of the chief towns of Central Asia. In former years it was a large garrison town; but since the advance the Russians have made into the more remote parts of Central Asia, troops have been gradually withdrawn from Orenburg to occupy more distant posts, and now the Envoy estimates the garrison at being no more than about 500 men. During his stay.in the town the Envoy paid a visit to the Governor of the district, who ceived him with great friendliness and entertained him at dinner in the evening. Khuda ar Khan, the late Ruler of Khokand, was in Orenburg at this time living under Russian •otection; the Governor engaged to invite him to meet the Envoy at dinner; but when the mr came Khuda Yar Khan sent his excuses instead of appearing, and the Envoy seems to be : opinion that he may possibly have had a hint from the authorities to stay awaj. Among other things the Governor spoke to the Envoy about was the mineral wealth of astern Turkestan, on which point the Envoy says “ he put me a great many questions, telling e that he knew that copper, lead, and iron were to be found on the Ihian Shian range on t le irthern frontier of Yarkund, and that he thought it a great pity that the Ameer left such iluable resources of wealth untouched. In reply to this I said tha was q ui 'e 0 \ 1 on, and that the same thing had been said to me by Sir Doug as _ oisy i . w 1® 1 i arkundin 1873, but that unfortunately the Ameer was an excessively prejudiced ma sinclined to lend an ear to questions that concerned the ^ ^ 0 ^ )U1&lt; f ! 1 , ,m i | sources of Yarkund, his idea being that the richer the country became the less . } &gt; to retain possession of it. To this the Governor remarked that ^ was n ot the right way look at things, and he suggested my pointing out to nm ie ^ 1 . osources . To which I ang lost to the country by such indifference to the deve op men worked as thino’s plied that there might be other difficulties in getting tie , ltH7ies 11 the Governor said that Le in a backward state in Yarkund and labour very unski led ^wlmn ^ Govern^ ^saad^ ^ e Russian Government would no doubt be only to ° , guit the Ameer. To this I replied traction of the ores from the mines if such a plan o.p.npnt hut that I would mention at there might be difficulties in the way^of such an arrangement, but e matter to the Ameer on my return to Kashgai. Orenburg is situated on the borders of Centra^ K h hgiz W1 Tffitrae habited by the a Kazaks/' or as . f RuSS f he AhaTLan^of mountains, and have a much hirgiz however are a nomad tribe inhabiting t ‘ “ t the “ Kazaks.” These latter ore Mongolian type of countenance than is to be found amon . tbe „ Ugul yuz” or e a very numerous tribe, and are split U P mto ^Kffihik Yuz' or little horde. Each eat horde, the “ Urta Yuz ” or middle / Af o£ smaller clans; of the three these main divisions is again broken up m 0 » , erous aac j powerful. It extends rdes the little horde has now become by far the n (f ^ Masjid' on one &gt;m the Orenburg frontier along the northern shores of the bea le and right up to the Siberian frontier on the o ei.The Kichik Yuz is divided into several minor tribes, among which may be mentioned the Chapas, Ungrat, Dawlat, Ak-bilak, Sanja-kulu, and Kainasiries. These last are notorious for the way they have persistently rebelled against the Russian yoke, and even at the present day it is said that Russian caravans are not safe from their attacks. They inhabit the northern shores of the Sea of Aral and the country beyond Fort Kazala, which was built, it is said, mainly with a view to keeping these robbers in check. Their name of Kainasiri is of recent origin, having been adopted only about forty years ago out of respect to a Kazak Chief of that name who had taken service under Muhammad Ali, Ruler of Khokand, and who contrived to make himself a reputation during the troublous times that characterised the reign of that monarch as a daring and adventurous soldier. Muhammad Ali thinking his services might be utilised against the Russians, sent him to check the advances they were then making in the direction of the Syr Daria. It is related that Kainasiri made no less than fifty different raids on Russian territory, in many of which he was successful; at last, however, his good fortune deserted him, and in an encounter with his enemies he fell a captive into their hands, and as a penalty for the trouble he had been to them during his life he was publicly executed. His followers, who are said to pride themselves on living entirely by plunder, are always known as Kaiuasiries. The “ Urta Yuz” or middle horde inhabit the provinces of Turkestan and Tashkand and the adjoining country north of the latter district, they are also subdivided into a number of smaller clans. The “ Ugul Yuz” or great horde occupy extensive tracts of country stretching beyond the “ Ala Tan” and “ Kara Tan ” mountains from Fort Julak on the Syr Daria to the shores of Lake Balkash and from thence to the frontier’s of Hi. All the Kazaks live by keeping large flocks and herds with which they roam about as occasion may require to different pasture lands; on these occasions all the members of the family, male and female, move together; the latter in addition to their domestic duties do a good deal of out-door work which gives them a very hardy appearance. Their habitation is a tent called an “ Akoe,” made of thick felt or f&lt; namda” spread over a circular framework of light wood; the tent is easily pitched and makes a very snug and com fortable abode, the warm material of which it is composed being complete protection in the coldest weather. South of the Sea of Aral beyond the Khivan frontier is another powerful and numerous nomadic tribe, the Turkomans. On a journey the Envoy once made from Khokand to Turkey through Khiva and Persia, he stayed some short time with the Khan of Khiva, who treated him with much hospitality. On his departure the Khan sent with him a body of Turkomans to escort him across the desert and see him safely within the Persian frontier. The extraordinary hardihood of these men, their power of travelling for days together without eating any cooked food, and their patient endurance of hardships and the severities of a very trying climate without any shelter, seems to have made a great impression on the Envoy, who is of opinion that if they were only brought under discipline and properly armed, they would make excellent troops, an opinion which is borne out by an English cavalry officer who recently made a tour through Persia, and in a book he published of his travels makes mention of the Turkomans as a race well adapted for the making of light cavalry. At present the Knvoy says however that, in addition to the drawback of want of discipline, they are also greatly weakened by their inability to coalesce, divided into many separate tribes they are perpetually quarrelling amongst each other; but if instead of this they would only unite and offer a combined front, he seems to think they might be a most serious check to any Russian advance on the Persian or Herat frontier. Orenburg to Orsk, two days by post. The distance from Orenburg to Tashkand is about 1,200 miles, and almost the whole of the intervening country is a barren desert. On the road a certain amount of wood and grass can be found at most of the stages, meat too is procurable from the nomad Khirgiz of the country, but of grain there is an absolute dearth, troops marching from Orenburg to Tashkand take their supplies of grain with them from Orenburg, and vice versa when starting from Tashkand. Tfic Envoy passed a night at Orsk, which he describes as a small and dirty town, just before it is reached a low range of hills has to be crossed, the road over which is in very bad order. Orsk to Yamankilla, Fort Karabutak. This is a small mud fort, the garrison of which the Envoy puts down at not more than 100 men.* The original fort, which has since been rebuilt by the Russians, is said to have been built by the order of a certain Beglar Beg, an IJsbeg * I robably a company or sotnia of Cossacks, the sotnia consists of 120 men. Schuyler puts the garrison of this fort down at something under 100 men, any way its strength must be very small.[ elxvii ] Ch. e {, to check the encroachments of the Russians, and to have received the name of Yaman- Mla or had fort from the number of men that were killed in it in encounters with the Ru”ian troops. There .s a small vrllage near the fort, the houses of which, as all those in this part 0 £ the country, are bmlt of mud, wood being much too scarce to be utilized for this purpose hem as it is on the other side of Orenburg, where there are extensive forests. ‘ 1 The Kazaks have recently; built two mosques near Port Kavabutak, because it is said the Russians accused them or having no place of worship, and endeavoured in consequence to make converts of them. On the road to Yamankilla the Envoy says he passed about 100 Russian infantry marching to Tashkand, and that he was much astonished at seeing so small a number of men for though he had heard nothing of the movement of troops at St. Petersburg or Moscow, reports were prevalent on the road that a large force Was on its way to Turkestan, in order to be ready to act as a reserve in case of hostilities breaking out against Khokand. Yamankilla to Fort Kazala, eight days by post. For three days occasional patches of cultivation are to he seen on the road when the Fort of Irghiz is reached, after this to Kazala the country is a barren waste of sand, the road indeed along it would, the Envoy says, he undistinguishable were it not for landmarks that have been placed along it, but after heavy falls of snow these occasionally get covered and caravans losing the track wander off on the steppes, where they sometimes get lost and are never heard of again. In former days in consequence of the depredations of the Kazaks this part of the country could only be traversed at considerable risk of life, but now-a-days under Russian rule matters have improved in this respect, and caravans can pass along with but very little risk of being attacked on the road, though occasionally a raid is made upon them. The Fort of Irghiz is a mud construction of the same kind as that at Karahutak, and containing a similar garrison. Kazala is a fairly populous town with a good bazaar, which is said to be the emporium of a flourishing trade carried on with the different Khanates of Central Asia. The fort in the town (known as Fort No. 1) has stronger defensive capabilities than those at Karahutak and Irghiz, though like them it is built only of mud. The garrison the Envoy puts down at about 200 infantry with a battery of artillery. Kazala to “ Ak-Masjid,” three days by post. Country utterly barren, and supplies procur able with difficulty. Water is also scarce in this part of the country ; wells have been sunk in different places along the road for the use of travellers, but these frequently dry up quite sud denly. About half-way between the two stages is the Fort of “ Karamatche (Fort No. 2), which is a repetition of the other forts, and contains the usual garrison of a company of infantry and battery of artillery. At “ Ak-Masiid,” Fort Perofsky, there is a small town, and cultivation is carried on to some extent in the surrounding country, but the land has not the character of being very fertile. The name of Ak-Masjid, the Envoy relates, is said to have had its origin in a mosque that was built here many years ago by a Kazak Chief, but which has since been destroyed. The fort is built on the banks of the Syr Daria, and is garrisoned with a sotma of infantry and battery of artillery. “ Ak-Masjid ” to Fort Julak, two days by post Country a waste, at the stages passed on the road. There is a village neat e 01 c ° , » q an ag houses with some cultivated ground in its vicinity. The fort is built on the P other forts on the Syr Daria, with the usual garrison. Julak to Turkestan, four days by post, during which another expanse of desolate and uncultivated ground has to be traversed. Turkestan is celebrated for having been theWrth-pkce ^ great Muhammadan Saint, who died there on a visi 101 th(j shririe o£ phis Saint IS said that when the Russian troops first advanced soiritual aid of the departed Saint was daily visited by crowds of pilgrims, who invoked ^ not to permit so holy a place to be desecrated by e oo P thousand The town of Turkestan is of considerable ^ in former days, houses, but it is not nearly so well populated now as^ ^ ^ ^ amonnt o{ cultivation in the Turkestan to Chemket, two days by p * becomes quite barren until Chemket is vicinity of Turkestan, but after leaving it tie PI, ., t p. ao . a { nt The water-supply of approached, when the country assumes a somew a , town is situated, is abundant Chemket coming from the Kara Tan Range, c ose bem 0 * chiefly wheat and barley, and good. Cultivation is extensively earned on, the p var i e ties. The town Fruit is also very plentiful, grapes, apricots, and m &amp; contains about five hundred houses.[ clxviii ] The Envo} ? says the Russians are.introducing a system o£ colonization into the steppes of Central Asia, and that a colony of Russian peasants “Mujiki” have established themselves in the neighbourhood of Chemket, where they are gradually becoming a prosperous community. He says that on the road between Anlietea and Pishpek there are several other colonies also in a very thriving condition. The telegraphic line through Turkestan branches off at Chemket, one line going via Anlietea to Almaty Port Vernoe, and the other to Taskkand and Samarcand. When the Envoy reached Chemket he found, he says, the place full of rumours about a large force of Russian troops being on their way from Moscow to occupy the posts vacated by the troops engaged in the operations against Khokand, and that considerable fuss was being made about the supplies that would be required for their use, which were being collected together with much ostentation, all the same, the Envoy says, he believes that in reality the Russians expected no reinforcements at all, but that the rumours were got up as a ruse to create a panic in the country and to prevent advantage being taken of the withdrawal of the troops for employment in Khokand for a general rising of the people of the country. The Envoy with some reason remarked to me that had it been the intention of the Russian Government to send I'einforcements to assist the army operating in Khokand, it is not at all likely that the opportunity would have been lost, during his stay in St. Petersburg, of acquainting him of the fact. There seems to be little doubt that General Kaufmann, the Govern or-General of Turkestan, was at the time apprehensive of a rising of the population against the Russian rule, in fact the Envoy says that before the troops were mobilised for service in Khokand, a proclamation was issued by him stating that the affairs of the Khanate required the interference of the Govern ment, and that accordingly troops would be sent there to support the policy it might be deemed advisable to carry out, that the Government relying on the loyalty and good-will of the people of the country felt confident that no advantage would be taken of the withdrawal of the garrisons for any outbreak or attempt to subvert the existing rule, but that in the event of any such attempt being made the most severe vengeance would be exacted.* According to the Envoy, General Kaufmann had sound reasons for his apprehensions, for there would appear to be great discontent prevalent in Tashkand against the Russian rule, and the revolt in Khokand, by arousing the sympathy of the people, naturally had a tendency to increase this bad feeline-. O Moreover the advent of the Envoy at this particular time seems also to have been regarded as an additional source of apprehension, so much so indeed that, although it had been arranged at St. Petersburg that he should go to Tashkand to meet General Kaufmann, the venue was now changed, and the Governor-General of Turkestan came to Chemket to see the Envoy - x but we may be pretty sure that General Kaufmann, who has the character of being most punctilious on all points of etiquette, would not have paid the Kashgar Envoy such an honor as this had he not had some strong reason for doing so. Moreover the Envoy was not permitted to visit Tashkand at all, notwithstanding the fact that all his relations live there, and he has considerable estates in the vicinity of the town which he bad particular reasons for wishing to visit. It is not likely that travelling in his position, such pressure would have been put upon his movements by the Russian Government had they not had good reason for apprehending the consequences that might ensue if they allowed the Envoy to show himself just at this time amongst the discontented population of Tashkand. ^ There can be no doubt that the influence of the family the Envoy belongs to is very great in Turkestan, and as head of it himself, his presence might have have had a powerful effect in arousing the passions of an excited population. When it became known that the Envoy would not visit Tashkand, a great number of his relations and friends came from there to see him in Chemket, but strict surveillance seems to have been exercised by the Russian authorities as to who should be admitted into his presence: a great number were refused permission to see him, and were turned away from his doors. He tells me that those who did come to him spoke in the strongest terms about, the oppression n Russian rule and the inimical feeling it was creating all over the country, he was assured that if any man of influence were to appear among them, the people would rise en masse against the Russians, he was begged, he says, to try and make his way into Khokand, where the people were looking eagerly for a ruler who would prevent their falling under the Russian yoke, and he was assured that if he would only go there he would find himself supported by a large fol lowing at once and be welcome to the throne. Much anxiety was felt just now as to what would be the fate of Khokand, though it seems to have been the general impression that the Russians, notwithstanding the assurances they were at this time giving to the country, fully intended to annex the Khanate. . Such a threat might be of use, for the people of Central Asia have had some experience of what a terrible thing iiussian vengeance is. r I'^naannla,43 [ clxix ] The day after the Envoy reached Chemket rtpnm-ol , Tashkand, preparations in grand style were made for his r,,.:epi™m ln ;mTth' 1 V™ llimse ’ f . £rom asked to goout and meet him but excused himself on the plea' of fatigue aftehLI^o' General Kaufmann, the Governor-General of Turkestan livp C tn r.,. + t f- , ' y, upon by all accounts as a very great personage in Central Asia The Turks ttlMd™ « !' , ° kC ' 1 Badshah” half-king and appear to look on him with all the rkerenee ^ absolute sovereign h,s word is law in the country, and the fact of his betg suhldbatet superior authority at St Petersburg never seems to he realised by the people under h s rale The Envoy descnbes h,m as an elderly gentleman with a manner which, though at times “tiff and dignified, he can make when he likes particularly pleasing and taking H? seems to have put the Envoy at us ease at once, and to have treated him with great courtesy; though he only stayed in Chemket one day, he saw the Envoy twice, once at an interview in the morn- ing, and again at an entertainment he gave him in the evening. The Envoy thus describes the interview he had with him: “The first tonic discussed was the mission of Colonel Reinthall to Yarkand in 1875, which General Kaufmann alluded to in anything but gratified terms, saying that Colonel Reinthall had left the country a «-ood deal annoyed at the treatment he had met with at the Amir’s hands,” to which I replied that 1 had heard something of this kind from some countrymen of my own I had met in Chemket and that the truth appealed to he that Colonel Reinthall did not like the arrangements that were made foi conducting him thiough the country, which he seemed to regard as restraints put upon his liberty, but they were not intended to be so. It is the custom in Yarkund, I explained to him, that when a person of distinction visits the country, he should be met on the borders by a deputation of the Ameer’s officers, who get the most stringent orders to pro vide for all his wants, and to escort him with the utmost comfort to his destination. On these occasions it is customary to make arrangements beforehand as to the most convenient stages to halt at, &amp;c., and the route once settled it involves great trouble to alter it. It appears that Colonel Reinthall did not approve of these restrictions on his movements, but at the same time they were never intended to cause him annoyance. To this General Kaufmann replied, that the best plan to prevent misunderstanding of this kind in future would he to arrange for the appointment of an agent to represent the Russian Government in Kashgar. He would be able to watch over the interests of Russian visitors and traders in the country, and see that the latter got a free market in the sale of their goods, c which, he went on to say, does not seem to be always the ease now-a-days, for I am constantly receiving petitions from traders about the difficulty experienced by them in getting a free sale for their goods in Yarkund.’ To this I replied that traders are very difficult people to please in the matter of profits, but all the same the Ameer desired to make trade as free as possible in his country, in Yarkund it was customary to do business in a certain way, which perhaps was not the way business was carried on in Russia, but in time perhaps the two systems might be assimilated. As to the question of the establishment of a Russian Agent in the country, I informed (General Kaufmann that I thought the plan had much to recommend it, and that I would make a point of bringing it to the Ameer’s notice on my return to Kashgar, but at present I was not empowered by him to do anything more than ascertain the wishes of the Russian Government on the subject. 1 added, too, that I thought the proposal for the establishment of an agency *vould more appropriately come from the Ameer than from the Russian Government. Here I took the opportunity of touching on a matter that I particularly desired to speak about to General Kaufmann, viz., the willing ear that is always given by Russian officials to any complaints made against tribes who may chance to occupy bordeis a joinin^ en 0 ^ rn ’ and the way petty acts of misdemeanour on the part of these oh ei ines are o en. made the plea for a regular casus belli.

Gene- “ The question of the threatened invasion c ^ anees of SUCC e SS of resisting the ral Kaufmann asking me what I thought °| f friendship of Russia and invasion, to which I replied that now t|&gt;*t the Amir ^haiHecure^d the England, I trusted he might have no difficulty 10 ° ^et much help from England, General Kaufmann laughed and said ‘ You are not likely, to &amp; et muc Fupon which I said chiefly to show that Yarkund was not entirely dependent for its friends on Russia, that the Sultan of Turkey had already largely aided the Ameer with presents of arms and officers to drill and organise his troops, and that it would be quite easy for the British Government to send a contingent of troops to Yarkund if it thought good to do so. “ I considered it just as well to say this, as I had heard it rumoured in Russia that the real reason for my having undertaken this mission was that I had failed to get any promise of assistance for the Ameer from either England or Turkey; moreover, although I am fully aware myself of the unlikelihood of the British Government sending any troops to Yarkund on account of the great difficulty of crossing the Karakoram range, the Russians appear to think that the road is quite practicable for troops, and that it is only called impracticable with a view to concealing the use it might be put to.* General Kaufmann after this went on to speak in a very bitter way of the English, ridiculing the idea of their alliance being of any advantage to Yarkund, abuse of the English I had found.to be a very eommop thing amongst the Russian officials, so much so indeed that on this occasion I ventured to say to General Kaufmann that although in my travels through India I had met great numbers of English officials, I never heard any of them speak of the Russians in the same abusive way as the Russians constantly spoke of the English, to which General Kaufmann replied f I have no wish to abuse them, but only to let you know the sort of people you have to deal with in them/ “ After this I brought up the private'business I had come to arrange about with General Kaufmann, and also the question of my right of proprietorship to certain lands in the vicinity of Tashkand, that had for a number of years been in the possession of my family, but which had lately been appropriated by the Russian Government: on both these matters General Kaufmann gave me a satisfactory hearing, the first was settled according to my wishes at once, and the lands he promised me should be made over to me on the validity of the title- deeds in my possession being proved. “ Apropos of land tenui’e, General Kaufmann said that it was a most difficult one for the Russian Government to deal with, for the whole revenue of Turkestan did not exceed *3,000,000 roubles, whilst the expenditure was not much under 8,000,000, so that the annual deficit amounted to about 5,000,000 roubles.f “ The chief source of expenditure General Kaufmann declared to be the army, the strength of which in Turkestan he told me was 15,000 men. “ All the same I put very little faith in what General Kaufmann said to me about the yearly loss to Government in the revenue of Turkestan. No Government would rule a coun try on these terms, and least of all, such a rapacious one as Russia has shown herself to be. In former times the Courts of the Central Asian Rulers were celebrated for their splendour and magnificence, they therefore, should the Rulers who have succeeded them, pretend that they cannot pay their way; as to the army I am positively certain that the strength of the Russian army in Turkestan does not exceed 10,000 men.j * Captain Terentieff in his book “ Russia and England in Central Asia” says that the English authorities have persistently tried to blind the Russians by making them think a natural barrier exists between Kashgar and India, while in reality there is an easy road. f It is interesting to see how nearly these figures correspond with what Mr. Schuyler gives as the statistics for the year 1873 in bis most interesting work on Turkestan— Income. Expenditure. Deficit. 1873 ... ^ ... ... 2,008,374 7,576,116 5,567,842 In 1874 Mr. Schuyler says the deficit must have exceeded 7 million roubles. J From repeated queries on the subject, I have made up the following detailed disposition of the troops the Russians have in Turkestan, and although the numbers shown may have no pretence to exactness, still I believe them to be sufficiently approximate to the truth to be worth recording:— Men.

The first stage beyond Chemket is a village called “ Mankit,” fairly populous with a good extent or cultivated ground about it: beyond this is another village (name not remem- beted by the Envoy) somewhat smaller than Mankit; along the rest of the road encampments of the nomad Khirgiz are passed; at the different stages where it is usual to make halts, the Envoy says, “serais” or rest-houses have been put up for the accommodation of travellers’ Aulietta, which is reached by post the third day after leaving Chemket, the Envoy describes as a town of considerable size, and the centre of a brisk trade, which is carried on with the Khirgiz and the nomad tribes inhabiting the country about. _ The Russians appear to have given encouragement to the development of this trade by having erected some buildings in the town for the accommodation of merchants and the protec tion of their goods. At Aulietta the Envoy received a communication from the Ameer of Kashgar, ordering him on no account to bring back a Russian Envoy with him. From Aulietta to Rishpek, a journey of four days by post, settlements of Russian pea sants “ monjeki” are scattered along the whole length of the road between Aulietta and Pishpek, the country would seem to be well adapted for colonisation, the soil being good, and the numerous streams flowing down from the adjoining hills forming a plentiful source of irrigation; the rainfall hereabouts is said to be fairly abundant also, at the same time the severity of the climate in winter is a drawback to agriculture, in confining the seasons when cultivation is possible to a limited period. The colonists, however, that are settled here, are reported to be gradually becoming wealthy and well-to-do communities, the men being hardy and thrifty. As an inducement to become colonists and leave their homes, they get their land as a free gift from the State, with immu nity from taxation for a certain period, which enables them to get a good start in life, and to cultivate for some years with the certainty of realising large profits. “ Pishpek ” was formerly one of the frontier forts of the Khokand district, but it was subsequently taken by the Russians, it lies on the direct road between Aulietta and Almaty, a branch road going over the Alexandrovsky range a little beyond it via Tokmak to Kashgar. Pishpek to Tokmak, one day’s journey over a very hilly bad road, the country about is rich and fertile, but very poorlv cultivated, as the Khirgiz, its only inhabitants, are very indifferent agriculturists. At the different stages along the road, sheds have been put up which afford a rough accommodation to travellers. Supplies are procurable in p en y &gt; o rn e nomad Khirgiz, who are to he found in great numbers all over the surrounding 11 s. o ma ' is a small town of about 500 houses, inhabited chiefly by Russians. * A second revolution in fact subsequently broke out which the Russians made a pretext foi i to ” id after this they annexed the Khanate. _ t) „ r , y t In relating this part of the interview the Envoy’s words were ‘ Ba kuda last soum j fci ie Envoy’s leaking the truth. Probably in making the proposition General Kaufmaun ma&gt; „pp. ns + 0 fog looked on with great ■eas of the Ameer’s rule, and possibly to tempt him to rise against him, or ye ’ ^ g av0 y himself, clever unity by the Russians who have repeatedly endeavoured to pick a quarre wi i • spirit or enter- an as he is, I don’t think that he would ever be tempted to a throne in ^ supporters. ■ise to face the dangers of such a position, otherwise his high family would ensure p )[ clxxii ] Tokmak to the Naryn river, eleven stages. The road beyond Tokmak is not passable for wheeled vehicles in its present state, but the Russians are improving it with a view to making it so. The country it passes over is very hilly, steep ascents and descents being frequent. On the Naryn river the Russians have an outpost of 400 men. This outpost is 184 miles distant from Kashgar. Fort Naryn to Chakmak, seven days. After crossing the river the first halting place is Tashkurgan. Thence to Chadyrkul crossing the Tashrobat range the road up to the pass is good; the pass itself is about 15,000 feet high and not difficult. Chadyrkul is the boundary between Kashgar and Russian territory. Russian sentries from the Naryn patrol as far as this, and are often met here by men belonging to the Ameer performing a similar duty from their side. At Chadyrkul (“ kul” means lake in Turki) there is a lake which, according to Russian surveys (I quote here from Captain Trotter’s account of the survey operations of the Yarkund Mission), is 14 miles in length and five or six in width. Kere the Russian officer that had accompanied the Envoy throughout his tour through Russian territory took his leave. He had expressed a great desire to visit Kashgar, and the Envoy says that he had given him a kind of promise to take him there, which he would have carried out but for an unfortunate act of misdemeanour on the part of Captain Nicolai, who appears to have misbehaved himself by a discreditable connexion with one of the women in the Envoy’s suite; she was induced to run away shortly after their departure from Tasbkand. The occurrence naturally annoyed the Envoy a good deal, the more so as he never succeeded in getting the woman back again, notwithstanding that he brought the matter to the notice of the authorities.* It was unfortunate that this should have happened just at the end of his journey, for it has left the most disagreeable impression on his mind, and has, I suspect, a good deal to do with the bitter tone he generally adopts in talking of the Russians. For some days after it occurred, he describes himself as having hardly been on speaking terms with Captain Nicolai, but when the time came for bidding good-bye, the Envoy said he did not like parting on bad terms with a man who had after all done him a good deal of ser vice, and so he entertained him at breakfast, and then bid him a friendly farewell. • About 30 miles beyond Chadyrkul is Kizzilak, where there is a small outpost of Kashgar troops, and eight miles beyond this are the Chakmak forts built by the Amir of Kashgar to command the ascent to the Turgut Pass. These forts are said to show no small amount of engineering skill in their construction, and their position is so favoured by the natural diffi culties of the mountains here, which are described as a series of inaccessible peaks, that the passage of the range at this point would no doubt prove a most difficult undertaking for a hostile force. The forts are about 70 miles from Kashgar. At this point the Envoy was met by a party of his own countrymen who had been despatched from Kashgar by the Ameer to wait his arrival and escort him back to the capital of Yarkund, and in their good hands we may safely place him to perform the small remaining portion of his long journey. I conclude this narrative by a few personal reflexions made by the Envoy on what he saw in Russia, and the impression his travels left on his mind of the people of the country. “ The thing, I think,” said the Envoy, “ that impressed me most on my journey through Russia was the poverty of the country, the people all seemed (‘ yuvisna’) hungry. The Government pays its servants badly, which I suppose accounts for the enormous amount of bribery that goes on in Turkestan, where it is impossible they say to get a hearing in any court of justice without giving large bribes, and those who can pay most can generally reckon on a favorable decision. “ O n their first annexation of territory in Central Asia, the Russians proclaimed that the prevailing system of taxation should be strictly adhered to, and no increase be permitted any where, but these promises have not been kept at all, for although they originally commenced on this plan, they kept it up only a very short time. The f Khiraj’ or land tax which, accord ing to Muhammadan law, should be one-tenth of the outturn of the soil, the crop not being taxed at all until it is garnered, so that a poor outturn is taxed proportionately, is now taken by measuring the land which is rated to produce a crop of some average worth, and then a certain proportion of this is taken, which makes tax fall about four times as heavily as it would under the old system. “Again the ‘ lanab/ a tax taken on gardens and orchards, according to a measure which varies in different parts of Central Asia, used also to be subject to a variation proportionate to the quantity of the crop, but this has now been made a fixed tax, and the severity with which it falls as such in comparison to what it did when variable, is severely felt by those who * 1 lie truth being I suspect that the woman was not anxious to go back to the Envoy, and the authorities declined to compel her.44 [ clxxiii ] have to pay it. Again house taxes are now taken, which were never W/l w „ »te of 50 'tangas- a year per house, or rather family, for itTs oTre^eSiltr' ^ reSlde ^ a h ^&gt; ^ ta^diTg “Traders are also taxed much more heavily now-a-days than formerly; merchandise imported into or exported out of the country was subject to the payment of ‘Zakat’ duty payable at the rate of Tl7 the value of the goods; this once paid the owner could go on tradin'. in the country as long as he liked without paying any further duty until he should take another caravan of goods out of the country, then it would be subject to the payment of a similar duty; local merchants who never left the town they might be settled in, used to nay yearly some very small duty (hardly more than one per cent.) on the declared value of their stock in trade, but the Russians have now introduced a system of licenses, which traders are required to buy in order to be permitted to carry on their business. These are of two kinds ‘ Pirbob and ‘ Iftarof*; the ‘ Pirbof’ which is so expensive that it can only be afforded by a man trading on a very large scale, enables its possessor to turn over his capital as often as he can within the limit of the year it holds good for; whereas the f Iftaroi/ which is levied in the first instance at a much lower rate, is repeated as often as the goods in the traders' possession may be changed. Under this system the small traders who are always natives are taxed much more heavily than the large merchants who are generally Russians. “ Eut perhaps the most unjust action the Russians have perpetrated in Central Asia, and the one that has caused the deepest discontent of all in the country, is the way the Government has appropriated the revenues of ‘ Wakff lands, or lands the revenues of which are devoted to mosques, colleges, or some such religious or charitable institutions ; not content indeed with this, they have in many instances destroyed the mosques and erected other buildings in their places. “ Although speaking personally I must say I met with much civility and hospitality in Russia, still it always seemed to me that Russian amiability was put on to suit a purpose and wanted genuineness. After all I heard of Russian oppression at Chemket, and after all I my self saw of their bad organisation, mismanagement, and tyranny, I could not bring myself to believe in the expressions of friendship that were made to me.,. Moreover the untrustworthi ness of their promises is now known throughout Central Asia : no one places the slightest reli ance on any of their declarations, even though they may be made officially by Government. This more than anything elese made me quite hopeless of reaping' any advantage from their friendship. General Kaufmann assured me at Chemket that the Russian Government had no intention of annexing Khokand, but I knew perfectly well that at the very time he said this he was making his plans for getting possession of the country. All the same I do not think it would have been annexed had it not been for the deplorable state it was reduced to by the tyrannous rule of Khuda Yar Khan, which made the inhabitants welcome any change. My great object had always been to create a good understanding between the Ameer o ai mm an Khuda Yar Khan, which would have brought the two countries together, and enabled them to offer a united front to Russian aggression. Had the plan succeeded, the absorption of Kho kand would never have taken place, for the Russians are far too weak m en ra i sia R. encoun ter any determined opposition. But unfortunately the obstinacy am put e o ll l ^ and the timidity of the Ameer of giving the Russians any cause o o ence, s oo Yarkund of the alliance I hoped to bring about between the two countries. On my return ^ Yarkund I told the Ameer of all I had seen, and what I thought of the Russians and m policy that he should adopt in future, I brought to his notice ^e way the Russian^ weie encroaching on his borders on one side, and the Chinese threa emng n of^the best state of things I said to him ‘You have done your best to estrange A «nt Inends ''' l uL'l - v., I.rl ’' V b, what I 'I' ta him tit EX' rrjASS;,i-y-XtS; ansSK I had just concluded, he said I must go off at once a„am o treaty between the two British Government to depute an Agent to Yarkund at once, that the treaty betwee countries might be carried out in its integrity.' a fow extracts fl . om Mr. I cannot refrain from adding to these remar s o J V TV rema rkable way the Schuyler’s most valuable work on Turkestan which bear out in a very truth of much of what the Envoy has said ; taxes ; m osed by Russia Volume II, pp. 241-4. After giving a !on S, 1 f : to the peop le to impose on Mr. Schuyler says—“ In this way notwithstanding 1 1 p ( ij s ti'icts, yet during a period of them no taxes except those declared on the oigamsa ion | up on the poor population, nearly three years 1 whole series of new disturbances, which even without that had been impoverished by the precemu 0 * “It is clear then that since the occupation of the «&gt;“n ry by ^ bet t e r, but on the of the population, in spite of all her pro mises, has grown y — ~ ' ^Tanga = about ith rupee.[ clxxiv ] contrary is every day getting worse and worse. How far tbis constant increase of taxes and imposts can go on^ the population of course cannot understand. It is therefore not strange that the frightened imagination of the Asiatics saw in the late collection of statistical inform ation the desire of the administration to get hold of their whole property; * * * with such a state of the popular mind it is evident that only a spark is necessary to inflame it. But no matter what institutions the Russians may introduce into Central Asia, it would seem hopeless to expect anything like good government until either the character of the officials is changed, or they are submitted to a stricter discipline and inspection. It seems almost impossible for a Russian administrator to conceive of such a thing as a legality. They are strict in observing the forms of the law so long as they relate merely to modes of procedure and to the filing and signature of papers, hut overstep it at once the moment it seems easier or more conveuiet to do so. * * * * It seems to be a principle firmly planted in their official breasts that law and respect for law are very good things for ordinary every-day life, but that the moment a circumstance arises, which in the opinion of the official most nearly concerned is exceptional, law is no longer practicable, hut what he calls administrative methods must be employed. * * * * This arbitrary action and these administrative methods are seldom alike in two adjoining districts, and a native can hardly help regarding the whole system as an irresponsible tyranny of the worst sort. Under Mussulman rule his Khans and Begs were tyrannical, hut still they were Mussulmans, men of his own race and of his own belief, with similar character and holding to the same customs and traditions. Cruel and tyrannical as they were in many respects, there were certain bounds which custom forbade them to overstep, and were these bounds too greatly or too frequently passed, the popular discontent was such as to drive them from power. But for the Russians there seem to be no limits. * * * * * It is not only a fact that glaring cases of corruption and venalty have occurred, but that these cases when brought to the notice of the Governor- General have frequently been condoned and the guilty officials allowed to go unpunished, jyhich has exerted a very bad influence on the minds of the natives. The superior officials have their favorities, and are disposed to uphold them in spite of charges of maladministration. The natives have been hindered in every possible way from making complaints. They have even been turned away from the house of the Governor when they had assembled there to present a petition. * ■ * * * “ The Russian maladministration naturally could have but one result, that of causing discontent among the natives. Before the war with Khokand this dissatisfaction was not believed in by the higher authorities, until circumstances occurred which rendered it very plain that in certain districts the population was disaffected to the Russian rule. Ordinary intercourse among the natives, even without making special enquiries, was sufficient to bring to light the same state of feeling.” o o The 15^ March 1877. jjjilAlEXl T1 ‘ THE VAR lilt a DOfflina ^le fastnesses iii® to the Al ;i@eofthe mi fail After tli ! llisiisnbordina |iireot view, %oak, Major! mountains a % in the Alai sfc own commr pg pastures of tl put was divk l is a feati id with a milit libors were ei45 appendix xviii.

These nomads descend from their almost inaccessible fastnesses o.n to the mountain slopes only for the winter months; in the summer they retire to the Alai Plateau, camping on the banks of the Kizyl-Su or Surkhab River, which is one of the main sources of the Oxus, where they are completely beyond the authority of Kokand. After the annexation of the Khanate to Russia, the Kara-Kirghiz continued to regard their subordination in the same light as before, but the Russian Government, of course, took a different view. In order, therefore, to reduce them to obedience, and to establish perfect order, Major-General Skobelef, Governor of the Ferghana Province, determined to show that their mountains were not invulnerable fastnesses to Russian troops, and that their summer quarters in the Alai were not inaccessible. He, therefore, organized a detachment which, under his own command, should advance to the Alai, and march into the very heart of the summer pastures of the Kirghiz, and so demonstrate the feasibility of coercing them. The detachment was divided into three columns: the Uch-Kurgan, Osh, and Gulcha columns, which were to proceed by separate routes and to effect a junction on the Alai. The Alai abuts immediately on the Pamir, and, being one of the least known parts of the world, it is a feature of the greatest interest. In view of this, the expedition was furnished with a military topographical party of eight persons. The astronomical and barome trical labours were entrusted to the Geodesist A. Bonsdorf; Mr. W. Oshanin was^ charged with the natural history department; and Captain Kostenko was commissioned to study the geography and statistics of the region. On reaching Ferghana, Messrs. Oshanin, Bonsdorf, and Kostenko were ordered to proceed to Gulcha, where they were to attach themselves to the column which was to be headed by the Commander of the expedition in person. This column was to take the main caravan road from Ferghana, to Kashgar across the Terek-Davan. They reached Gulcha on the 18th-30th July, finding that the column had already marched out towards Kizyl-Kurgan. Gulcha is the most advanced Russian outpost in Central Asia; a quadrangular fort of ordinary profile, with two turrets at opposite angles, is being erected there, which is to be fortified wit i our guns. The fort stands on the banks of the Gulcha River, one of the principal sources or t e tipper Syr, in a perfectly flat valley about two miles wide, and commands the u a ^ as well as the Chigorchik Defile. Strong winds, blowing from west to east up the valley, are of great frequency. Here, as in the whole of the mountainous zone o ey., ana, it rains as often as it blows; snow falls thickly in the winter, and the fros s aie some i ie severe; Ordinarily, the princmal arm of the Gulcha is about seventy fee wic e, an i may forded, though with some difficulty; hence a wooden bridge is thrown over i ° the traffic, which, as a rule, is stopped during the period of high watei ( une new s } bed of the river is 4,100 feet above sea level.

No sooner had the troops bivouacked, than it became known that a party of Kara-Kirghiz, headed by Abdulla-Beg, had attacked the Russian messenger, Shabdan, who bad been deputed to the enemy’s quarters with a summons to surrender, whereupon General Skobelef at once despatched a flying column under Colonel Prince AVittgenstein. On the 29th July (10th August) the main force struck its camp on the Kizyl-Yart, and followed Wittgenstein’s flying column to the Archa Ravine. The first five miles of road were found easy, but the pass over the Archa Mountains proved rather difficult. This range is very steep, for the crest of the pass is only one mile from the foot of the mountains, but 1,500 feet above it. The pass has an absolute height of 10,300 feet. The peaks on either side, by measurement with the sextant, attain 13,000 feet. The pathway up to the pass is very winding, and many of the horses tumbled down the percipices, but their packs were nearly all recovered.* The Taldyk Pass, further west, is considerably less steep, and may, therefore, be more easily adapted for a carriage road. The Arena Pass overlooks the valley (or rather high table-land) of the Kizyl-Su River, which, on the south side, is skirted by a grand mountain chain, snow-capped throughout its entire extent. Almost immediately opposite the pass rises the Peak Kauffmann, so named by the late Mr. Pedchenko, in honor of the Governor-General of Turkestan. The descent from the Archa Pass to the Kizyl-Su Valley is six miles long. A rivulet runs parallel with the defile through which lies the descent, and the slopes on both sides are com pletely bare, while on the other hand, the bottom and the sides of the valley are carpeted with a tall, thick, and succulent grass, variegated with flowers. The Kizyl-Su, flowing near the foot of the descent, winds in a broad bed, measuring two-thirds of a mile across, and is divided into several channels, the largest of which was found to contain about 28 inches of red-colored (kizyl) water (in the month of August). This color comes from the clay of the river-bed; but the water has a good taste and is potable. Having crossed some narrow dry troughs, the detachment came to a halt for the night on the bank of the Kitchkine-Kizyl-Su, a small Stream which is also red in color. The troops bivouacked at an elevation of 9,300 feet, and about two miles and a half from the Kizyl-Su. It was a very cold night; the thermometer fell to 5° C., and a hoar frost lay on the ground. But when the sun rose, the temperature rose rapidly with him, and by midday the air was warm enough for the officers to retain only their linen frocks. On the 30th July (11th August) the detachment advanced in a south-easterly direction to the base of the Trans-Alai Range, where Wittgenstein’s flying column was already occupying a position. This day’s march was one of eight miles : consequently the breadth of the Alai Plateau, in the section traversed, is about 11^ miles. The next night-halt was in the Sub-Alpine zone of the Trans-Alai, where the detachment camped with Wittgenstein’s column. On that same day the latter had performed a reconnaissance to the top of the Kizyl-Yart Pass and off the road, in course of which a large flock of sheep and a great number of horses were seized; but the most important capture was that of the mother and wives of Abdulla-Beg. After nightfall Wittgenstein’s column started for the Kizyl-Yart Defile, in pursuit of Abdulla-Beg, most of whose band, aecordiug to intelligence received, had dispersed, leaving him with only 25 followers. On the 31st July (12th August) the Bais and Elders of all the Kara-Kirghiz clans wan dering on the Alai came into camp with proffers of submission to the Russian authorities.' The Chief of the detachment received them, but in punishment for their defection, and because many of their clansmen had adhered to Abdulla-Beg, he imposed upon them a small fine, ordering them to pay up for the current year, and in one instalment, six roubles oil each tributary sheep (ram) in lieu of four (the usual rate), and binding them down to furnish a few hundred laborers to make a road from Gulcha to Sofi-Kurgan. The captives were released, and all the insurgents who had been seized at various stages en route, were pardoned. Abdulla- Beg’s mother, a clever and energetic woman, exercising great influence over the people, was kindly received by General Skobelef, who presented her with rich presents and desired her to induce the Kara-Kirghiz tribes to remain tranquil, to occupy themselves with their own affairs, and to become good subjects of the White Czar. This she was willing to do, and promised to call upon her son to submit to the Russian Government. On the lst-13th August the camp was shifted to a more convenient position, where Skobelef was resolved to await the arrival of the Uch-Kurgan column. At 11 a.m. a party of Wittgenstein’s column returned to camp, from a position on Lake Kara-Kul, from whence he and his Cossacks, reinforced by half a company of mounted fusiliers,t continued the pur suit of Abdulla-Beg, who was said to have fled in the direction of Afghanistan. * * Prince Wittgenstein traversed this pass by night without any accident, t This flyiug corps was joined by M.

The stream which forms the defile flows in several branches through its southern portion, in a smooth bed; but the latter was thickly studded with boulders, and the horses had to tread with great circumspection. Bv removino- these boulders winch retarded the march of the column advancing to the Kara-Kul esneciallv near the Kizyl-Yart Pass, the 17 miles from the mouth of the deffie to the (altitude 11,700 feet), might he easily converted into a fairly good cart-road. The summit of the pass commands the Pamir generally, and the Pamir of hares (native appellation Pamir Chargosh or Hargashi) in particular; the southern portion of the latter contains the Kara- Kul. Several snowy peaks are visible on each side of the pass, bat these hardly rise to 14,000 feet. A mass of bare snow-capped mountains, stretching in various directions, also open to the view, and these seem to be intersected by more or less wide valleys and gorges, as denuded of vegetation as the mountains themselves. The descent from the pass is easy ; about a mile and a half below the top it breaks on the wide bed of a torrent called the Kurun-Sai (dry bed), notwithstanding which appellation, a stream runs here in the direction from south to north. From the side of the Pamir, the foot of the pass has an elevation of 11,000 feeti The lengthy and wide bed of the Kurun-Sai merges into the above-mentioned Sak Valley, which steadily ascends for 13 miles in an easterly direction. The mountains enclosing it do not attain the height of perpetual snow; they are bare and rocky, and, being composed of argillaceous sandstone, are wholly covered with detritus. At right angles with this valley the mountains are broken by transverse ravines. Through the breaks in these ranges (altitude 12—13,000 feet) higher snow-capped mountains are visible on both sides. Prom the summit of the pass, which forms the upper termination of the Sak Valley, Kostenko enjoyed a truly grand panorama of the Kara-Kul hollow, with the large azure lake and its elevated islands in the centre. After a gradual descent of eight miles the column came to a halt for the night, on the bank of one of the small streams flowing into the lake, and at a short distance from its mouth. On the following day, August 3rd-15th, Kostenko explored the Kara-Kul and its islands, which, having the appearance of a longitudinal ridge intersecting its plane from north to south, occupy a considerable portion of the surface. The largest of the islands adjoins the north shore, being connected with it by a narrow neck of land, which forms a natura bridge. This island-ridge rises from 600 to 700 feet above the level of the lake, and seems to be encroaching on the latter, for there would appear to. have been lakes an ciee^s over some of the low-lands. The surface of these depressions is now covered wi magne sium which the sand has not yet had time to cover, and which glitters paintu y 0 e eyes, like snow.

Simla: Government Central Branch Press,[ clxxviii ] The column bivouacked several days on the shore of the Kara-Kul (Pamir), awaiting 1 the return of a scout whom Prince Wittgenstein had sent to ascertain Abdulla Beg's place of concealment. After four days' absence the scout returned with the information that Abdulla-Beg had fled across the Afghan border, intending to proceed to Mecca. As no order had been received to return to the Alai, Kostenko, Lieutenant-Colonel Lebedef, and Bonsdorf, obtained the Commander's permission to undertake an exploring trip towards the Kashgar frontier, in the direction of Lake Ran-Kul (Rung-Kul) and the region of Sary- Kol. Taking an escort of fifteen mounted fusiliers, and provisions for three days, this little party started on the 6th-18th August, advancing along the eastern margin of the Kara-Kul. On the following day the travellers entered the Ala-Baital (speckled mare) Ravine. The route lay upwards along the bed of a small torrent, which in some places ran underground. As they ascended, the path grew steeper; and after a march of four miles from its mouth, they reached the top of the ravine, forming a pass of 1&amp;,000 feet above sea level. The latter, as well as the mountain sides of the defile, are composed of soft substances covered in every part with fragments of schist. En route the travellers observed hares and wild goats (chamois), as well as eagles and crows. A steep descent, over three miles in length, brought them down into the valley of the Chon-Su (big river), to the point of its confluence with the Uzbel-Su. This valley, varying from one to two miles in width, extends from south-east to north-west, and that of the Uzbel-Su, the right affluent of the Chon-Su, joins it at an obtuse angle within 13^ miles of the efflux of the Chon-Su, so that the lower course of the latter is at the same time a continuation of the Uzbel-Su. Lower down the Chon-Su turns abruptly, and falls into the southern extremity of the Kara-Kul. After halting at the confluence of these two streams, the explorers proceeded easterly, follow ing up the course of the Uzbel-Su. Having the character of all hill streams, this rivulet runs a course of about 23 miles without any deviation from its original direction. In its lower course it is very much confined by mountains of no great height, which are composed of red clay and conglomerate, the road being obstructed by boulders and stones; further on, how ever, the valley opens out to widths of one and two miles, with a flat smooth surface, gradually ascending eastwards. The ranges to the right and left rise to two and three thousand feet above the valley, those, however, skirting it on the left or south side being somewhat higher, attaining to 15,000 and 16,000 feet, and so rising above the snow-line. These mountains are composed of soft formations, covered with fragments of schist, which glitter in the sun. The declivities are bare and sterile, as is also the surface of the Uzbel-Su Valley. Small patches of grass, in some places very succulent and feeding, occur only on the banks of the Uzbel-Su and along the torrents pouring down from the mountains. It is this verdure which enables the nomads to feed their cattle, and the travellers saw traces of their passage all the way of this rivulet; and, indeed, they mostly advanced along a beaten track, which must be taken to represent the high road from the Alai by Kara-Kul to Sary-Kol, and to the confines of Kashgar. The two ranges which form the Uzbel-Su Valley unite at the sources of that stream, and so form the Uzbel Pass, separating the Kara-Kul hollow from the basin of the Sary-Kol, and, generally speaking, from the headwaters of the Tarim-Gol. The red-coloured, saddle-shaped Uzbel Pass is discernible at a distance of 16 to 17 miles, and the party advanced nearly all the way straight towards it. The summit of this pass (12,500 feet above sea level) commands: westward the entire valley of the Uzbel-Su, clearly defined, and the lower course of the Chon-Su; beyond the latter rises a snow-capped range of 16—18,000 feet height, which has the appearance of a crenellated wall. Towards the east lies a high valley containing one of the sources of the Kashgar-Darya, resembling that of the Uzbel-Su in point of con figuration, which, a long way ahead, seems barred by a grand chain of mountains, rising considerably above the snow-line. This is doubtless the range mentioned by Colonel Yule (in his Sketch of the Geography and History of the Amu- Darya, Sources') which forms the eastern boundary of the Pamir Plateau, dividing it from East Turkestan. Referring to Hayward, Colonel Yule estimates the altitude of some of its peaks at 20—21,000 feet; but in Kostenko s opinion they attain a height of 25—26,000 feet. The distance from the Uzbel to this^ range is about 50 miles, and 40 miles beyond the same commences the territory of Kashgar. r lhe discovery of this high range settles one of the most important questions relating to the geography of Central Asia, that is, the question of the existence of a meridional range laid down by Humboldt, and named by him the Bolor Mountains, which, in recent times, was denied, at first by Russian travellers (Severtsof, 1 edchenko), and then by English geographers, on the ground that the Tian-Shan and Himalayan systems combined to form the block which Humboldt took for a meridional range. In the opinion of these explorers the two gigantic mountain systems were connected by means of a series of ranges mainly extending from east to west. Fedchenko concluded that the configuration of the Pamir was similar to that of the tracts which he had seen, viz., that it consisted of longitudinal valleys, skirted by parallel ranges. Hence he positively dis puted the existence of a meridional rang’e on the east side of the Pamir, and said that Mr. Hayward had simply taken the abrupt side of the Pamir for a transverse chain of mountains, having seen it from the Kashgar side in the month of March, when it was snow-bound.46 [ clxxix ] Kostenko saw tins range from the opposite side, on the 7th 1 Annw i t0 ^ C01lBgUration o £ the ^ i* q u lte „£ anotCkinTXKm According to native intelligence, the distance from the Uzbel Pis. fn ^ e m „n i i of Ran-Kul is 16 mi es, and from the latter to Sarv-Kol eight miles. Sary-Kol, meaning yellow hand, is the name oi a stream and its valley, which latter is said to be occu^T by a considerable number of nomads. The stream, pouring down eastwards from Mount Uzbeh falls m with another at the toot of the pass, forming a tolerably large river, which is said to flow through the Ran-Kul, and to run thence into Kashgar territory under the name of Sary- Kol This, however requires further confirmation. Strongly as Kostenko desired to push on to Sary-Kol, he could not do so for lack of provisions. After spending the night at the foot of the Uzbel Pass, on the other side at the outflow of the Kashgar River, the party commenced their return journey. The Uzbel was re-crossed on the 8th-20th August. This pass is high, but easy of ascent. It has the appearance of having been hewn out, and presents no difficulty either up or down. One might cross it in a carriage. The ground consists of red clay, covered with pebble stones. From the bases of the pass proper to the top, the height is 1,000 feet. The adjoining peaks reach an elevation of 14,000 feet, that is, they rise 1,500 feet above the summit of the pass, and some of them are covered by small streaks of snow. We may generally remark that, throughout the extent of territory which Kostenko traversed, the region of snow begins at 14 and 15 (or even 16) thousand feet on the north and south side respectively. On the 9th-21st August, with a view to avoid the Ala-Baital Pass, Kostenko’s party returned by way of the Little Chon-Su Defile, a route which proved much more convenient, and not at all longer, than that over the pass. In this defile through which, although it is named after the Chon-Su, the latter does not flow, the pass is hardly noticeable: one has only to sur mount a few hillocks, the last of which separates it from the hollow of the Kara-Kul, and forms the converging point of three roads, leading to Badakshan, Kokand (over the Kizyl-Yart), and to Kashgar (over the Uzbel-Su), respectively. At about 3 p.m. the travellers rejoined the column on the Kara-Kul, and on the same day (21st August) Wittgenstein marched to the Alai. On the Uth-23rd, the main column of the expedition was once more united at Archa-Bulak, near the southern base of the Alai Range, within 13 miles of the mouth of the Kizyl-Yart Defile. From Kostenko’s description we cull the following general observations relating to that portion of the Pamir which he visited. The Trans-Alai Mountains, having the appearance of an immense white mass of Alps, limit the Pamir on the north. Beyond this range extends a high uneven plateau, gradually rising towards the centre, which is intersected in all directions by other ranges. Ihese latter, of which several are snow-capped, rise but little above the intervening valleys and plains. The whole forms one irregular mass of plains, valleys, hollow r s, and mountain lidgcs, not lim ning in one particular direction, but heaped and tumbled together, as it weie, in a most ui n i&lt;ii&gt; fashion. This Alpine region is almost perfectly bare, producing neither trees, brushwood, nor grass. Small patches of grass occur only along the courses of the mountain streams an although short, this grass is frequently thick and succulent, attending oot oi ic ca e o the nomads. The mountains being of a soft formation, all the passes are comparatively low and easy, and the streams, pouring down from no great altitudes, offer no impediment all roads throughout the Paink are tolerably good The ground is either sandy and stony, argillaceous, sandy-salinous, or simply salinous.

It commands the valley of the Tus-Altyn-Dara (Darya?), which falls into the Kizyl-Su on the left, almost immediately opposite the Kurgan. The detachment halted about one-third of a mile from the fort on the right bank of the Kizj l-Su, at an elevation of 7,400 feet above the sea level.* Here it was joined on the same day by General Skobelef. On the following day (t 8th-30th August) Prince Wittgenstein was despatched up the Tus-Altyn-Dara, t b' order to reduce to obedience the Ichkilik Kirghiz, who had not yet presented themselves to the Commanding Officer. The head water of this river is remarkable as oiviim rise to another stream flowing in a diametrically opposite direction, inasmuch as the brook of ? Ters-Agar, falling from a snow-capped summit of the left or eastern range, divides into two at its base, one flowing northwards and forming the Tus-Altyn-Dara, and the other running due south, under the name of Ters-Agar, into the Muk-Su River. In this way the ravine and the source are common to both streams. The pass is almost imperceptible to the eye; its absolute height attains 9,700 feet above sea level. On the 19th-31st Wittgenstein resumed his march before daybreak, dividing his column into several parties, who set out in various directions to capture all the cattle of the recalci trant nomads which they might find. Kostenko was. charged to reconnoitre the country ahead, and Lieutenant Shilin accompanied his party for the purpose of performing a topo- oraphic survey. At 6 a.m, they started for the valley of the Ters-Agar, which flows flush with its banks. Following the gentle decline of its bed for about three miles, the stream tumbles sheer into the deep and clearly defined valley of the Muk-Su River. The aspect of this deep trough-shaped cavity, through which the Muk-Su rushes headlong in several branches is one of the grandest that can be imagined. It lies between high, rocky, and very precipitous mountains, those on the south being snow-girt. The natives call them the .11 an (or Gau) Mountains, and their highest peaks rise at least 25,009 feet above sea level. Numerous milk white streamlets purl down from under the glaciers, which latter extend nearly down to the valley. The altitude of the northern range does not exceed 14 to 15 thou sand^ feet; it is also less steep than the other, and but partially snow-bound. Over its crumbling side, commencing at an altitude of 9,500, there descends a zigzag pathway of nearly three miles into the valley of the Muk-Su. The latter has an abundant stream of white-opaque-colored water, and is not fordable. Its sources are: the Sel-Saya (or Sel-Sai), the largest of them, which pierces through the southern range (Hauj, and flows in a north-westerly direction; the Koundy (or Koinda), whose course runs west; the Suok-Sai flowin«'south-west; and finally, the above-mentioned Ters-Agar, which comes in from the north. The valley of the Muk-Su extends from east to west, with a slight southing (5°), and the river passes into Karategin, where it joins the Kizyl-Su, thus helping to form the Surkhab affluent of the Oxus. From the sources of the Muk-Su Kostenko's party returned to the district of Jialgys, where, at a point within 13 miles of Daraut-Kurgan, the different parties of the column bad been ordered to meet; and on the 20th August (1st September) Wittgenstein rejoined General Skobelef at Daraut-Kurgan. 1 The following day witnessed the arrival of Sofi-Shah, a relative of .Sayid Mahomed, Shah of Karategin, whom Skobelef had invited for the purpose of effecting certain frontier regulations, &amp;c. Sofi-Shah declared that his sovereign, as well as the latter's councillors, were anxious to maintain a good understanding with Russia, and to fulfil all the orders of the Russian authorities, after which the envoy w r as invited to accompany the expeditionary force to Great Karamuk, on the Karategin frontier, where Skobelef purposed to fix the boundary line between Ferghana and Karategin, and where all other matters were to be settled at the same time. On the 23rd August (4th September) the whole detachment advanced accordingly. The road to Great Karamuk (about 19 miles) follows the right bank of the Kizyl-Su, and passes over several ledges, here and there bridged over; but as there was only this one narrow road over the ledges of the northern range abutting on the river, the progress of the troops was necessarily slow, and the halting place was not reached till late in the evening. Below Fort Daraut-Kurgan the width of the Kizyl-Su Valley is considerably reduced; here it loses the name of Dasht-i-Alai (Steppe of the Alai), and assumes the character of a ravine, about a mile wide; but at Great Karamuk it expands again, up to nearly two and, a half miles, in which form it extends for about four miles.

[Extract from a Discussion at a Meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, London.~\ “ Colonel H. Yule said the Russians seemed to attach a great deal of importance to the discovery of the so-called meridional range, but Lieutenant Hayward had described the same mountains seven or eight years ago, and, after him, Captain Trotter stated that the eastern portion of the Pamir was bordered by a very high, snowy chain of mountains, running from north to south. The Russian expedition had attached a fictitious importance to this, recalling the ideas of Plumboldt, and going back to the views of Ptolemy, and they proposed to call the range, after the great patron of geographical science in Russia, the Constantine Range; but if it had to he called after the great pillar of geographical science at the time of its discovery, it should rather have the name of Roderick or Henry! It was said in the paper that Ptolemy described the Imaus as a meridional range [i.e., running from north to south), and as distinct from the mountains to the south and north of it; but the fact was that Ptolemy s authority, so far as it went, was just the other way. Ptolemy called all the mountainous legion by the same name —“ Imaus”—which was merely a Grsecising of the word Himalaya, oi what ever was the form of that name in his day. The real, prominent distinction between tiese wo parts of the great elevation of Central Asia was not physical, but historical the Himalayas proper had been in all history the great impassable barrier between Central Asia and n la, while the Pamir had been the great col or hill-passage between Western and Eastern Asia between Asia inhabited by Persian and Turkish races, and Asia mha n ee y 10 iace ® time to time subject to the Chinese Empire. In fact the Pamir was a soi o sea wa , which the ocean of Chinese domination had beaten again and again m ie , f • three thousand years. What Ptolemy said about it was probably the most g _ the dry bones of his geographical tables. In the introduction o 'ns ^ i accoim p iug the length of the habitable earth, not having many data a an ' / f China for silk of the journey of a certain Macedonian merchant, Maes Titianus, who Z Mr. Mid,ell alluded to this, and spoke of the approach to Kykgir as I f ^ aorty That was an old idea, but an entrrely mistaken one. OMateyea.sj ^ been discovered to this journey of Ptolemy s merchant, f hill-country of the Bactva (or Balkh) they travelled .omewtat to the nortt, by th* Corned®. It was now known from the Chinese ba d ition 0 £ the great French scholars within the last twenty or thirty}. &lt;. , Khotlan to the west, Corned® was. The district was described as having Shignan to the south, Jvnotl17 [ clxxxii ] and the Oms along the south-west. The position of London on the Thames could not be described more exiStly, and that fixed the position of the Corned® in what was now Darwaz and Koshan. From the hill-country of the Corned® the merchant went somewhat to the south, and then turned up a great gorge which led him to the £ stone tower, traces of which would probably be found when the hill-country of Shignan was better known 1 hence he crossed the Laus into the empire of China. So far, then, as Ptolemy s authority bore on the physical history of this isthmus of mountains, it was in favour of its identification with the Himalaya; thouo-h his authority in that respect was not worth much. The Russians, too, seemed to desire to return to the old name of Bolor. Their proof of the name seemed to be something like Jack Cade’s proof of his Mortimer ancestry. His putative father being a bricklayer, Jack s friend. Smith, the weaver, says : £ Yes, and be built the chimney of my father s house, and the very bricks are there to this day to testify thereof : therefore deny it not! Ihe name Bolor’ arose entirely out of a mistake, and he hoped it would not be used again, merely because it had been found that there was a range of mountains running from north to south. a One thin 0, further he would remark that had struck him in connection with the name of the Muk-Su which the Russians had described as a tributary of the Surkhab, the great north ern branch of the Oxus, because it curiously illustrated how different was the fate of truth and falsehood. In that fictitious narrative, which caused so much discussion some years ago, this remon was crossed and recrossed by an imaginary traveller who gave many names. Since then new names had been learnt and old ones recovered, but none of the names mentioned by the German traveller had been recovered. The name f Muk,’ however, occurred in the history of the Mocnil Emperors. The Emperor Humayun had a rebellion* brother who was sent into banishment, and made Nawab, or whatever it was, of Karateghm and Jf^. Probably that name of Muk had hardly ever been heard since the sixteenth century until within the last two or three years. Thus the real name turned up in the real country, while the false names were heard of no more. “ Sir H. Rawlinson said he had very little to add to what Colonel Yule had said. There were a few points upon which he did not entirely agree with Colonel Yule, but generally he was in accord with him upon this subject. His recent enquiries had led him to the conclusion that the real route of Ptolemy’s merchant was up the Surkhab. All the late Russian surveys had been in the north-east portion of the Pamir, about one-third of which they had crossed, and their approach in that direction had not unnaturally excited a good deal of interest, and perhaps apprehension, in India; but he thought the result of the survey had been to show that that line of country was quite impassable by an army, though it was an easy enough country for the Kirghiz to pass over. He felt bound also to protest against the idea that the Kirghiz were of Aryan derivation. If ever there was a pure Turanian race, it was the Kirghiz ; and the notion of their being Aryans was one of Klaproth’s paradoxes, like his fable of the identity of the Irrawaddy with the great river of Thibet. These Kirghiz now possessed the whole of the Pamir, and found it very easy to travel over in all directions, but it could not be crossed by an army. It contained, indeed, no supplies whatever except herbage in summer. If ever the Russians approached the valley of the Oxus—which was a very rich and attractive country it would most assuredly he by the line of the Surkhab or the great Wakhsh river, and not by the Pamir. Perhaps he would rather surprise Colonel Yule when he stated that he believed that was Ptolemy’s old route, and that the famous stone tower would probably be found some where in Karateghin; in fact it might be the same as the Rasht of the geographers, which for many centuries was the limit of the Mohammedan world. Washgird, which was the capital of this region, was, he believed, at Fyzabad, where there was a river—the Ilek—along which passed the route from Washgird towards Rasht, which latter site would probably be found at Garm. In Timour’s campaigns, when they wished to pass from Hissar to Mogulistan, they invariably went up this river, and Baber did the same. Karateghin was first mentioned in the wars of Timour, the name being derived from Karateghin, a local Chief, who, under the Sama- nides, was Governor of that country, and who died at Bost, in A.H. 317, and was buried at Isfijab in the famous Robat Karateghin. He believed there was a European still living Colonel Gardiner—who had actually crossed from the valley of the Oxus into the Alai, along the course of the Surkhab or Wakhsh. In the biography, at any rate, of that extraordinary man, which was published by Sir Henry Durand in the Friend of India, some ten or twelve years ago, it was stated that Colonel Gardiner did actually pass from Badakshan through I)arwaz to the Alai, and if that were so, he ought to have information concerning those countries of the greatest value; but his papers were in such a confused and unintelligible state that nothing worth geographical discussion had ever yet been recovered from them. No doubt the questions of physical geography which arose in consequence of these Russian discoveries were important, but he quite agreed with Colonel Yule that there was nothing very new about them. The so-called meridional range was, he believed, not meridional, but slanted off: to the west. Neither was it a separate range, but merely the series of eastern culminating points of the ranges which transected Pamir, and of which the Alai and Trans- Alai were branches. u General R. Straehey hoped that all travellers who had their accounts translated into another language would have such an excellent interpreter as Mr. Miehell. He entirely agreed with Colonel Yule regarding the general view that should be taken of the mountain ridges that47 [ clxxxiii ] had been discussed. When a mountain ranffe was sr&gt;nVon :i. i 11 „ understood what was meant by the expression.

The same dry north-west wmds blew with equal violence along the valley of the Ovus during the hot months, as over the plains of Northern India, and he had no doubt a haze was produced there in the same wav as in the Himalayas. JAPPENDIX XIX. NOTES ON KOKAND BY COLONEL YENIUKOFF. I. The recent invasion of Kokand by our troops is calculated to lend an interest to some particulars concerning- that Khanate, the exploration of which country has been effected solely bv Russian men of science, step by step, for more than 130 years Commencing from Miller and Kushelef (1739-43), who proceeded to Kokand from Orenburg by a very circuitous route across the Balkhas desert and the lower course of the Chu River, we find a series of Russian travellers and men of science whose works have gradually thrown a light on the character of the famous Farghana valley and on the surrounding regions. In the year 1800 two Russian Engineer officers, Pospelof and Burnashef, penetrated into Kokand,* who gave as admirable a description of Tashkend and the surrounding country as was possible at that period. In the year 1813 the interpreter Nazarof reached Kokand itself, and went even as far as Ush. Seven teen years later the Khanate of Kokand was again visited and described by Potanin, and in the beginning of the second half of the present century, Yeliaminof-Zernuf compiled an excellent work on Kokand from materials in the archives of Orenburg, and from information collected by Gens from traders and Kirghiz. In the year 1858, Bardashef, an interpreter of the Alatau administrative circuit, collated the evidence which he obtained by interrogation from leaders of caravans at Vernoe, and constructed, with the aid of topographers, a manuscript map of the Khanate of Kokand, which in many respects is found to be accurate even up to this day. In 1861, Staff Captain Veniukof, embodying all this material and other data which were pro curable in the Omsk archives, was enabled to publish a map of Kokand, based on a critical appreciation of the above materials. Then supervened the brilliant era of the successes of the Russian arms in the country lying to the north-west of Farghana, accompanied by the fresh epoch of scientific research in the valley of the Jaxartes throughout its entire extent. The upper portions of the river, which had long appertained to Kokand, were explored by Protsenko, Sebertsof, Krayefski, and Kaulbars. While Struve conducted a series of astronomical observ ations in Farghana, Fedchenko studied its natural history; the political history became the study of Sobolef, and its ethnography was enquired into by a multitude of other Central Asian explorers. In a word, Kokand was scientifically conquered by Russians long before the historical course of inevitable circumstances introduced the invincible Russian troops into the region. We now know very well what is contained in Kokand. This small Khanate shorn of so much territory in the years 1863 to 1868, represents a superficial area of 1,400 square geo graphical miles (German), i.e., smaller than the province of Saratof by 100 square miles. Its population is half that of Saratof, viz., 800,000; the general aspect is that of a valley within a framework of mountains, leaving a narrow opening on the west of Khodjend. The length of this valley, called larghana, is 2.05 miles, and the width in few places exceeds 33 miles,f so that the entire area does not embrace more than 280 square geographical miles (German). The rest of the Khanate is filled with mountains, which attain the greatest elevation on the south, towards Karateghin and the Alai, where, according to Mr. Fedchenko, there are peaks 20,000 feet above the sqa. The mountain girdle on the north side the Kendyr-tau, Chatkal, and Urtyk- tau ranges are also of considerable altitude, rising in many places above the snow line. On the east the valley is closed by the Djassy, Koghart, and Chichikty mountains, through the last- named of which the Naryn rushes with the impetuosity of a mountain torrent; this is the chief river of the^ Khanate, and in the vicinity of Namagan it receives the name of Syr-Daria (Jaxartes). This river flows nearer to the northern than to the southern confines of the Khanate, so that the greater portion of the habitable part of the country is on the south side of the river. As in the case of most of the rivers in Central Asia, the banks of this stream are almost unpopulated; the towns and settlements stand off at some distance. This is to be accounted for by the flooding of the low lands, by their insalubrity, and partially also by the stretches of barren sands which occur in the centre of the river valley. The portion of the I arghana valley which is famous for the fertility of its soil lies on the south side, commencing from within a few miles of the river, and is not so much irrigated by the waters of the Jaxartes as by the streams issuing from the southern mountains, such as the Isfara, Sokh, Shaghimardan, Isfairarn, Ak-bura, Kurshab, Tara, Kara-Kulsha, and Yassa; the four last named of these streams unite in one river, the Syr proper, according to the natives. The lands of Kokand are migated by means of canals, sometimes extending 60 or 70 miles; all the mountain streams are similarly run into aryks, and consequently do not reach the main river. The Naryn has no large affluent from the north within the limits of the Khanate. * These officers visited Tashkend, the capital of the Kirghiz Kaisaks at that time. f The lineal measurements are alone reduced from versts.[ clxxxv ] Of the 280 square geographical miles occupied bv TWP r i , nature, or fit for cultivation.

We are not mtormed as to the abundance of the crops raised, but VelaioimoE Zernof calcnlated that, w.thm the Imuts described, the Khan of Kokand collected an annua tnbute of 128,120 tons of gram. Supposing tins estimate to have been exaggerated still comparing the fertl &gt;ty of Farghana with that of Miankal and Knldja, it may be said that the former can yield 320,000 tons of grain, quite sufficient to feed the entire population within the Khanate, and even that of the neighbouring mountain districts. It was this fertility of the soil of Kokand that always attracted towards the Khanate the tribes of the conterminous hill districts. And since these mountaineers surrounded the valley of Farghana on all sides they naturally played an important part, and not unfrequently took the lead, in the political affairs of the country. All the more recent revolutions in Kokand have actually had their origin in the moun tains, among the Kipchaks and other Kirghiz, and these could never thoroughly be controlled, because the fertile oases in Kokand lay in the centre of their pasturing grounds, instead of along their outskirts, as in the basin of the Hi and Tarim river system. There is no occasion to dilate on the mineral wealth of Kokand; these resources are but little developed, although it is well known that the country can yield in many places an abundance of naptha, coal, iron,'copper, and even precious metals. Cattle farming constitutes, after agriculture and the cultivation of gardens, one of the chief occupations in Kokand. This is in the hands of the Kirghiz camping in the hills and steppes, while the Uzbegs and Tadjiks, inhabiting the irrigated valleys, devote themselves to the soil. The exchange of the pro ducts of the fields for the livestock constitutes the barter trade of the Kokandians, many of whom make fortunes out of it, although, owing to the r ipacity of the Khans and Beks, it is rather to a maiFs disadvantage to be reputed wealthy. The chief centre of trade in the Khanate is Kokand, after which may be ranked Andijan, Namangan, Marghilan, Assakeh, Isfara, and other places where large bazars are held. It is to be observed that the Sarts of Kokand, who in other parts of Asia compose the trading class, are more generally known under the name of Andijanese. The elements of the population of Kokand and their social organization are the same as in other Central Asiatic States. They have, however, some few peculiarities. The Uzbegs, while holding the reins of power, are in the minority, being in point of numbers the thiid in the list of tribes inhabiting Kokand. The most numerous are the Kirghiz, among whom the Kipchaks are the most influential tribe. The Tadjiks come next. These form the citizen and industrial class of the population; from their midst come the mollahs and mirzas (secietaiies), and generally speaking, they are the intellectual heads of the people, the UzDegs ^ere ie rulers, while the Kirghiz were the unruly, wandering mass, who on the one hand robbed tbe sedentary inhabitants whenever opportunity offered, and on the other were tiemse ves unmeici fully squeezed by the Kokan traffickers and tribute collectors. From the recent history of this heterogeneous population the expulsion Kliudayar Khan was to have been foreseen; the Khan had cruelly anmhi a e a giea or U' , . , p Kipchaks, to whose support he had been indebted for his tin one. e iek&lt; ^ , • i i received in 1874 by Gtmeral Kolpakofski on the subject of the heavy imposts levied by the Khan throughout the country clearly indicated an explosion. II The Khanate of Kokand, as an independent State, is as anc ^\ Khan, Central Asiatic powers. The rulers of the country claim o e. e ® ce ^ . Mmo- tribe and has although the present ruling family is of Uzbeg origin, eongin^ ^ Kokand corn- governed for less than one hundred years. The relations bet we n ^ USS1 ^ tbe menced in the middle of the last century. These were thoroughly peaceful, consisting[ clxxxvi ] despatch of caravans from Kokand into the Russian Kirghiz steppes and the so-called Gor kaya (Bitter) line, the traders of Kokand and Tashkend were as regular in their visits to Troitsk and Petropavlofsk, as the traders of Khiva and Bokhara were habitual visitors at Orenburo*. There was even at Semipalatinsk a trade conducted by the Kokand Sarts who traverse(f the desert west of the Balkash lake. Towards the middle of our century the value of this Russo-Kokand trade attained to one million of roubles; this includes only those goods which were brought to and which left the line. After the pacification of the steppes (1740), these commercial relations improved, and Russian cloths, cotton stuffs, and metallic ware found a wide circulation in the Jaxartes valley, which was at that time a geographical synonym for Kokand. This trade was of such great importance to Kokand that the annexation to Russia, in 1S46, of the steppe of the Great Horde—which up to that time had been looked upon as a dependency of the Khans of Farghana—did not produce a rupture of friendship. This annexation, brought about by the free-will of the Kirghiz themselves, and the consolida tion of the Russian power north of the Jaxartes and Chu rivers, did not, however, please the Kokandians, hence, being unable openly to resist them, they instigated the Kirghiz of the Kara-tau fnountains and others along the Russian confines to make raids into the Russian ter ritories. The Russian Ulutau Station stood the brunt of these raids, and was finally aban doned with a view to obviating ditticulties; but this sacrifice and other examples of moder ation, as for instance, when the Russians abstained from pursuing parties of depredators, were construed by Kokand, as is always the case in Asia, into symptoms of weakness, consequently our relations were gradually spoiled, and not only grew cool but hostile, terminating in military operations. In 1852 a small Russian detachment attempted the demolition of Ak Mesjid, on the Jaxartes, which was simply a nest of robbers, but the attempt was unsuccessful, in conse quence of which the Governor-General of Orenburg took the fort in the following year after an obstinate resistance. The Kokandians made an effort to recover it in the month of Decem ber of the same year, but suffered a decided reverse at the hands of a small Russian detach ment sent from Fort Perofski (Ak-Mesjid) up the frozen Jaxartes. The foundation in 1854 of Fort Yernoe, in the Trans-Hi country, i.e., in the midst of the Kirghiz of the Great Horde, and in the vicinity of the limits of the Kara-Kirghiz, was a second blow to the Kokandians, and it may be considered to have been a great material advan tage to ourselves, and more fruitful in results than the capture of Ak-Mesjid. Flourishing Russian agricultural settlements rapidly sprang up around Yernoe, which could not be estab lished in the steppes bordering the Jaxartes, and the proximity to Kokand of these settlements foreboded the approach of a continuous tempest, and not merely of a passing storm, as when an isolated fort was so occupied, or of an occasional one, as in the times of the employment of flying detachments. The Kokandians at once erected a line of forts in the country of the Chu River, and commenced to harass the Russians with still greater determination. They not alone instigated the Kara-Kirghiz free-booters to hostilities against them, but had even the audacity, in 1860, to invade the Alatau District, with the intention of demolishing the advanced post at Kastek, which guarded the passes and prevented irruptions of Kara-Kirghiz. The result of this invasion was not only the defeat of the Kokand hosts at Kastek, but also the advance of the Russians across the Chu, and the seizure in the course of three years of the Kokand forts, Tokmak, Pishpek, Merke, and Kurtka.* At the same time, the turbulence of the Kirghiz of Kokand, by the lower course of the Jaxartes, compelled the Russians to occupy Julek and Yani-Kurgan, and to extend military operations to the Karatau mountains. This series of successful Russian operations ought to have brought the Kokandians to their senses, but their shortsightedness and their Mohammedan fanaticism were so extreme that they never thought of amicable relations, notwithstanding that in 1864 there were very marked signs of a Russian desire to draw a line of limitation from the embouchure of the Jaxartes to Yernoe, along the northern slopes of the Karatau and Kirghiz-Alatau mountains, i e. } to leave the Kokandians all their settlements, and even the camping grounds of the majority of the Kara-Kirghiz. The Khan and his counsellors still entertained the idea of pushing the Russians back beyond the Chu, and they naturally paid dearly for their temerity. During the period from 1864 to 1866 they lost Aulieta, Turkestan, Chemkend, Tashkend, and finally Khodjend, the connecting link between the dominions of Khudayar and those of his friend Muzaffar-ed- deen of Bokhara. Then, and only then, the Kokandians realized the situation, and resolved upon accepting the terms of a treaty of peace which reserved to them their independence. Notwithstanding her losses of territory, Kokand has preserved a sufficiency of independ ence for the maintenance of a wholesome vitality. In some respects the Khanate has even gained, since the year 1867, in having disembarrassed itself of the greater portion of the pas turing grounds of the Kirghiz, whose turbuleney and depredations were a constant source of trouble and expense to the sedentary portion of the population. Confined within the limits of Farghana and the surrounding mountains, the Kokandians were enabled to devote themselves in peace to the development of the internal resources of their country, and to a prosecution * That the capture of these forts was only a measure of reprisal, and hot an evidence of a conquering tendency, is proved by the fact that when, in 1859, a force of 600 men, with four guns, was sent out from Vernoe, it was for bidden to take either Tokmak or Pishpek and to cross the Chu River. Pishpek, ■rfhich was restored in I860, was abandoned, and reconstructed by the Kokandians, and it was only after another invasion of the Russian territories, and after a second defeat of the Kokandians at Uzuu-Agatch, that Pishpek was finally captured and demolished.21 48 L clxxxvii ] of trade, tlie roads and markets being thoroughly secured thrrmoV. x- -i They did, indeed, turn their attention partially to these ^ of Russia.

The administration of Mussilman-Kul was dis tinguished by wisdom an absence of extravagance, and even by as much justice as is compati ble with Asiatic understanding. His economy, especially in the matter of the Court expenditure • was, however displeasing to the young Khan, and by degrees Khudayar's ill favor towards his influential Minister, with the support of the Sart party which was inimical to the Kipchaks, increased to an intense hatred and extended to the whole of the Kipchak tribe. Forgetful of his obligations, the Khan ordered his aged Minister to execution, havino- first made him witness of the terrible massacre of his tribesmen. According to information obtained, about 20,000 Kipchaks perished. The sanguinary ferocity enraged the remaining portion of the Kipchaks, who had always been reputed to be the most warlike element among the population. • Khudayar could thenceforward never expect any kind of support or sympathy from them, while he was frequently obliged to mollify them by concessions. “ Having determined to increase the productiveness of his country, Khudayar raised the imposts on the people to an extortionate degree, and introduced many new taxes. For instance, he made a monopoly of the sale of leaches from his ponds; he enforced payment for entertain ment provided by him to the people of dancing bears, &amp;c.; and he appropriated half of the fuel brought up for sale in the bazaars, &amp;c. [this was noticed in Abstracts for 1874]. In this manner the Khan alienated from himself the industrial classes—that is, the Sarts—having already won the execrations of the Kipchaks, and reduced the number of his adherents. Sooner or later he was bound to remain standing alone, beyond all possibility of occupying the throne. “ But the severity in the collection of the taxes, and the disaffection of the Kipchaks, would not have entirely deprived Khudayar of the respect of the people, if it had appeared that the revenues were applied to the necessities of State. The Khan abandoned himself latterly to a vicious life of extravagant pleasures. He frequently rode out to sport with his falcons, &amp;c., and entirely neglected the affairs of government. Conspiracies and open revolts were formed in rapid succession, and Khudayar found himself obliged even to drown one of his own relatives in a pond behind the palace. In the year 1874, the Cipehaks in the eastern portion of the Khanate, and the Kara-Kirghiz in their vicinity, took to arms, and although the insur rection was temporarily subdued, it was not long breaking out afresh. Abdul Rahman, Avto- bachi, the son of the ill-starred Mussulman-Kul, headed the malcontents, and the Khan was compelled to fly to Khodjend to seek protection at the hands of the Russians. “The Kokandians proceeded to invade the Russian territories, and attacked Khodjend. The victory at Makhram was the Russian answer to this audacity. After a few days, beid- nassir-ed-deen, the son of Khudayar Khan, well known within the Russian confines since his visit to Tashkend, succeeded in opening amicable relations with General Von Kautmann. ibe example of the young heir was followed by the leader of popular msurrec ion, an y a of Kipehaks and Kii|hiz elders.

The reunion with Russia of Farg-an [Upper Kokand] advances her frontier to the Upper Oxus, or that part of Central Asia generally called the Pamir uplands. The northern frontier of this remote region is formed by the south Kokand ridges; the eastern by the Kizil Yart mountains—a lofty chain visible from Kashgar; the southern by that portion of the Hindu Kush close to the Himalaya; and the western by some district of Bokhara. The English having investigated this country for many years past, the greater part of what we have gleaned of its political arrangements is derived from the information collected by their agents. Of these inquisitive travellers a whole host may be mentioned. Burnes, Wood, Abdul-Medjid, Manpool, Faize Baksh, Mirza Sudja, Havildar Hyder Shah, Munshee, Abdul Latan, Biddulph, Ata Mahommed, and Trotter are the English agents to be mentioned in connexion with the Upper Oxus. Besides the intelligence derived from them, we have the journals of Russian travellers, such as Fedchenko, Abramoff, Kaulbars, Aminoif, Mischenkoff, Mayeff, and others. The River Amou Darya, or Oxus, is formed by the confluence of two rivers called Sarchad and Pandj, rising in the higher plateaux of the Pamir. The sources of both these little rivers are close to those of the Tarim, from which they are only separated by a strip of level ground. The Pandj takes its origin east of the Lake Sarikul, through which it flows at a height of 13,900 feet above the sea; the Sarchad rises near Lake Guskul (Barkat Yasil), belonging to the Tarim system, and situated at a height of 13,100 feet above the sea. Having united somewhere above Kila Pandj, the two rivers assume the common name of Pandj, and under this appellation flow south-west to Ishkasim. The valleys of this Pandj, as well as of the original Pandj at Sarchad, are called Vakhan. The valley of the principal Pandj is 200 versts long and about one verst wide at the bottom. The ridges north and south of this valley rising to an enormous height, the tops of those parallel mountains, whose bases are only one verst apart, are 85 versts distant from each other. Hence the character of the glen is that of perfect ravine, like the Engadine or the Rhone Valley in Valais. Vakhan forms a separate principality, whose ruler, Fateh Ali Shah, lives in Kila Pandj&gt; on the left side of the river, near the projecting spurs of the Hindu Kush. This principality embraces twenty villages and a few scattered groups of houses. The inhabitants of Vakhan are of Arian descent, though the hills are partly occupied by Kirghiz, leading here, as everywhere, a nomad life. Biddulph apportions to Fateh Ali Shah the sovereignty of the greater part of the uninhabited Pamir; but this is a mere subterfuge of the wily Englishman to make Europe believe that Afghan—that is British—influence lawfully extends to the right bank of the Amou. It is well known that for this purpose the English likewise represent Vakhan as a vassal dependency of Badakshan, which has lately become an Afghan province; but even Biddulph fails to enlighten us as to the grounds on which he bases the alleged rela tions between the two countries. Indeed, the mere fact that Biddulph and his companions as late as 1874 were prevented by political reasons from proceeding from Vakhan to Badakshan is sufficient proof that there is no connexion between the two countries, or, in other words, that the former is independent. At Ishkasim the river Pandj bends to the north, and proceeding in that direction 125 versts is joined by the Murchab or Bartan—a considerable river coming down from the north eastern wilds of the Pamir. The valley of the Pandj jvidens in this part of its course, but is still a rocky defile. About twenty versts north of Ishkasim, just above the ruby mines once so celebrated, but now abandoned, there begins the principality of Shighan. It extends along the Pandj as far as Yasgulan, at which place the Pandj penetrates the hills, going off to the north-west. The hills take a north-eastern direction, and belong to Shignan, nobody knows how far. All that has been ascertained is that Shignan, approaching the Pamir plateau, borders upon the possessions of Yakub Beg of Kashgar, and more especially upon the district of Tashkurgan. Besides the Pandj, Shignan is watered by the rivers Shah Darya and Murchab. Part of this principality is situate on the left bank of the Pandj, and borders upon Badakshan, the exact locality and direction of the frontier being unknown. The north west corner of Shignan is called Roshan, a district with an hereditary ruler, who has some times been the vassal of the Ameer of Shignan, and at other times owed allegiance to the Khan of Badakshan. The capital of Shignan is Bar-Pandj, on the left bank of the river; the capital of Roshan is Kila-Vamar, on the right bank of the river, at the confluence of the Murchab. As Roshan can equip an army of 6,000 men, it is concluded that all Shignan has about 100,000 inhabitants of Arian (Tadshik) and Kirghiz descent. The ruler of Shignan, Josef Ali Khan, according to the testimony of Biddulph, which dates from 1874, is an independent ruler.[ clxxxix ] Leaving the defile at Yasgulan, the Paudi flows in n , 1AT .fU - Kila Khumb, then turning south-west forms 1 semi-circle about'l50^ f d, 1 rectlon . as far as of 100 versts.

Proceeding from this point south-east we remain m the basmot the Koktcha Darya, the most important tributary of the Amou Darya, on the left side of the river. This basin constitutes the Khanate of Badakshan, whose capital is Feizabad. Though the frontiers of Badakshan are not exactlv defined, we know its southern district to be separated by Hindu Kush from Chitral In the west it is bounded by the branch of the Hindu Kush, which forms the watershed between the Koktcha and the Akserai and Oxus, while on the east there are the hills separating the Koktcha from the Pandj, more than 1(J,000 feet high near Zebak. The northern frontier of Badakshau, where it touches Darwaz and Roshan, remains to be investigated. It is also a matter of doubt whether the important border towns of Kila Ogan (Kila Afghan), Yankila and Zebak, guarding the roads to Kundus, Kulab, and Vakhan, are occupied by the’Afghans’ the present masters of Badakshan; but there are about 3,000 Afghan troops at Peizabad, as we learn from statements in the Anglo-Indian press. The inhabitants of Badakshan are Tadshiks, ancient emigrants from Balkh; but there is also a sprinkling of Usbeks (Turk Tartars) Hindus, Chitralians, and other natives of the Hindu Kush, all of them hostile to the Afghans. Badakshan has long been an independent State. Its last national King, Jahandar Khan, who was defeated by the Afghans in 1874, is still alive, hiding his diminished head somewhere among the Turkoman tribes, while on the throne he was supportei by the Ameer of Shignau and the Padishah of Chitral. Forty versts below the Koktcha, the Suchrab or Vaksh or Kizil Su, a considerable stream, falls into the Oxus on the right. The lower course of the Suehrab waters Hissar and a portion of the late Khanate of Kolab, now belonging to Bokhara; but its middle course from Baljuan belongs to Karateghin (a name meaning Black Hill'/ just like Tchernagara, the so-called Montenegro). This small but fertile province, according to the information collected by Abramow, has about 400 villages with a population of 100,000, all of them Galtch or Tadshik mountaineers. In 1870, the ruler of the State was Musafar Shah, who ranged himself on the side of Kokand, and ultimately fled to that Khanate. The present prince, Rachim Shah, is under Bokhara influence. Karateghin is bounded on the north by the Russian territories of Zarafshan and Fargan; on the south by Darwaz; on the west by Bokhara; its eastern confines being unknown, although we have ledchenko’s testimony for the fact, that as late as 1870 the Kirghiz near Alai considered themselves subjects of Kokand. Probably the eastern frontier of Karateghin is somewhere about the ravine of Isfairam, through which the Suchrab flows. The country east of Karateghin, Darwaz, and Shignan, is the Pamir, or rather the Pamirs—a succession of immense plateaux like the. Thiaushan Syrts oi t e i )e an m- si- Tan, many of them so high as to be called by the natives the Roof o t ie or . correct measurements are wanting, we are enabled to infer, from the somce 0 ie m ° u a D a being 13,900 feet high, that the Pamir is about the same elevation.

So, at any rate, says Biddulp i . , . • • j “ From what we have said it will be seen that the A^L^reach^p^ theTamir. Taken by five, or including Kulab, by six principalities our o^ ^ ^ ^ and 350 V ersts from together these six principalities extend about 4.^ - miles.

There m little wo Badakshan and the northern more in the upper basin of the Amou than in taat 0 slopes of the Hindu Kush have plenty of trees.The aborigines of this distant region are of Arian descent, and known by various names, such as Padshiks Galtch, Vakhannese, &amp;c. To them has been added an admixture of Usbeks, Kirghiz and quite lately Afghans. To be of Arian descent is a proud boast. The dynasties of Vakhau Shignan, and Darwaz trace their pedigree back to Alexander the Great; and, indeed we know from history that Balkh, f the mother of cities/ near the Upper Oxus, was the capital of an empire founded by the Macedonians, and which existed 136 years. When looking upon the countries along the upper course of the Amou, three political questions force themselves upon us. First, what is the condition of Badakshan, conquered between 1872 and 1874 by the Afghans, at the bidding of the English? Secondly, what is the amount of influence exercised by the Ameer of Bokhara in Kulab and Karateghin ? Thirdly, where are the frontiers of Kashgar, Yakhao, Shignan, Darwaz, and the late Khanate of Kokand, in the Pamir region ? These questions remain to be answered by investigations to be made on the spot. For the present it will suffice to say that in 1874 the Badakshan people were still fighting for their hereditary ruler, so that the English expedition, although under Afghan protection, could not penetrate from Vakhan to Feizabad. Kulab has been QjPy re cently subjugated by Bokhara j its late ruler, San Beg, li\es at Kubul. At Alai, Fedchenko, in 1870, saw Kokand Kirghiz; while Nikitin, in 1875, met the first Kashgar guard only 40 versts S.E. of the pass of Terek Davan, crossing the south-eastern hills of Kokand. The above very interesting sketch should be supplemented by a notable fact. A short time ago the principality of Karateghin, in a Russian statement claiming to be equally authentic with the present, was represented as a depend ency of Kokand, its late ruler having considered himself the friend and humble ally of that once redoubtable Khanate. There is certainly no great difference between Russia’s ruling directly in Karateghin, as belonging to annexed Kokand, and indirectly, because she regards that country as subject to Bokhara, itself a vassal of the Russian Empire; but though the Russians certainly can have no hostile intentions against India at this time of day, it ought to be known that they are virtually established on the southern side of the Kokand Hills, where there are roads into Kashgar, and further on into India, avoiding the Himalaya and Hindu Kush. [Secret, December 1875, No. 62.] [Times* Berlin correspondent, dated \ oth April 1876.]appendix XXL THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN IN KOKAND,* BY A. YAMBERY Russians After more than ten years of continuous progress, conquest, and annexation the ,ans have at length met w.th an enemy worthy to he called so as regards his staunchness and perseverance, but not it we only consider the means of defence which the talented Baber founded an empire in Hindustan, consisted, to a large extent'if not exelnsively, of Kipchaks, who followed their adventurous leader from the^lovely valley of Andijan to the wealthy country of the five rivers (Punjab). But who are the Kipchaks? This people, respecting the origin of which the oldest historical monuments of the Turks brum us but scanty information,f forms part of a family which is scattered all over Central Asia. °The portion which is most pure in origin, and least influenced by foreign contact, has remained on the southern slopes of the Alai, and on the upper course of the Naryn, from the time of their immigration. If, nevertheless, we also meet Kipchaks amongst the Karaks and Uzbegs, they must be looked upon as men belonging to that family, who have retained their old name even after having mixed with other tribes of the Turkish nation. It may be that the natural strength of the present home of the Kipchaks in a mountainous and not easily accessible district, or that their long and bloody feuds with the Kalmuks and Mongols of Old Dzungaria, or their comparatively modern struggles with the Chinese, have made them so stalwart and pre-eminently warlike, but it is a fact that their fame as dauntless warriors can be traced back for four or five hundred years. In the Shaibaninamah, an epic narrative of the exploits of Muhammad Shaibaui Khan, j; we find a classification of the various Turkish tribes coming from Parghana to be enrolled under the banner of the new conqueror, and here the Kipchaks are designated as the bravest of the brave. After the overthrow of the Timurides, and the consolidation of Uzbeg power in the three Khanates, little or nothing is heard about them in the country between the Oxus and ‘the Jaxartes; but much greater is the share they took in the events of Eastern Turkestan, where almost every political revolution is connected with Turks coming from Kokand. These were undoubtedly Kipchaks or Kara-Kirghiz. As to the recent appearance of the Kipchaks in history, it is generally known that, although they took part in the struggles of the late twenty-five years against the Russians, slowly moving down from two points, namely, from the district of Semiryechensk on the north-eastern, and from the embouchures of the Jaxartes on the north-western frontiers of Kokand, the part they played was not a prominent one, and the energy which they displayed was not at all in proportion to the former reputation of their arms. It was only for a short period, namely, when the much hated Khudayar Khan was expelled from his country, that they appear defenders against the overwhelming power of the northern invader. Alem-Kul, himself a Kipchak, fell at the head of his army under Taskkend, but as soon as Khudayar Khan was reinstated in his power, and made sure of the Y')®? 4 ','''“L . former enemies, the Kipehaks and Kara-Kirghiz at once retired, foste, ; m » m ^ ’ Koi Their two-fold hatred and animosity .against Khudayar ^a^the f oe, threatening national hero, and of other Chiefs of their tribe, as well as against the ; J their independence.

And indeed the ambitious and unnatural son had a very easy game to play in overthrowing the throne of his father. Khudayar Khan, all his life long a cruel and an avaricious tyrant, had become, under the protection of his Russian friends, quite unbearable. The different ways in which he tried to extort money from his subjects is almost incredible. Thus we are told that he kept a kind of monopoly on leeches, and every one who wanted a bleeding was compelled to pay heavy prices for the official bloodsuckers. He had further made the arrangement that bears should be led around the town by his soldiers for public amusement, and whether inclined or not to find diversion in the dancing of the shaggy inhabitant of the woods, the people had to pay liberally to the royal merry-maker. Of course such paternal care could not be endured for a long time, and we cannot find fault with the Kokandians if they tried to get rid of a Prince waom they had already driven away four times, and who had been always forced upon them by foreign interference. Passing over the unsuccessful rising of the Kipchaks two years ago, which was frustrated by Russian intervention, we come to the first rumours of the present contest, which reached us towards the end of the past summer. It is surprising that General Kauffmann should not have hesitated to send a diplomatico-scientific mission on the 11th July, namely, at the very out break of the rebellion, to the Court of a Prince who was just about to pack up his luggage, and to leave his country altogether. General Skobelef, who was entrusted with this mission, is an able officer, already famous for his adventurous reconnoitring trip from the Caspian to the Lake Sary Kamysh, on the eve of the Khiva campaign. He found the Khan in a very unenviable position, threatened on all sides by open and seeret enemies, in the ranks of which were not only his foremost officers, but even his own children, nay, the heir-apparent to the throne, his eldest son, Nasir-ud-din. On the arrival of his Russian guests, Khudayar Khan took great care to conceal his dangerous position, but being pressed upon too hardly by the rebels, who advanced from the east and the south headed by his former generals and by his sons, he finally laid open his wounds to the Russians, asked their assistance in the utmost distress, and leaving his residence on the 22nd July (old style), he took a western direction. Whilst still only a few miles from his capital, Khudayar apparently hesitated as to what steps he should take. He still had a few thousand men at his disposal, and he even showed himself inclined to sacrifice his Russian companions. But when the last remnants of his military power suddenly went over to the enemy, he could not do otherwise than throw himself under the shelter of General Skobelef, who, accompanied by twenty Cossacks and a few Russian traders, succeeded in bringing the party safely to Khojend. It was certainly.a narrow escape; but on the other hand, the fact that thousands of rebels were constantly on the heels of the escaping party must convince us that they intended to show forbearance. The Kokandians were satisfied at seeing themselves liberated from their hated ruler, and nothing could result from barring his flight. Khudayar Khan having reached the Russian territory, expressed his thanks in a pathetic letter to his liberator, and handed over his royal person, as well as his kingdom, to the mercy of the White Padishah, keeping for himself the twenty or thirty camels laden with treasure, which may furnish him the means of living as a prince exile on the banks of the Neva. After this event the rising in Kokand at once became general. The real soul of the movement was, from the very beginning, a son of the late Mussulman-Kul, named Abdur Rahman, with the official title of Aftabeji (holder of the washing-can), a man of energy and military experience, and in full possession of the confidence of his people, namely, the Kipchaks. Next to him stood Pulad Beg (the steel prince), of Kara-Kirghiz extraction, more impulsive than the former, but with less sagacity. He had great influence over Karateghin; and succeeded in raising a rebellion in Macha (Kuhistan), the mountainous district east of Samarcand. There were others besides, such as Isa Aulia (Yessaul?) Muhammad Amir, Batir Tor, Isfandiar Khalik Kul, Kazi-bek, Nar Muhammad, and a few influential Khojas; but they did not remain permanently in the foreground, and it is only the two first-named personages that must be looked upon as the regular leaders of the movement. At the very outset of the rebellion neither Aftabeji nor Pulad betrayed any ambition for the supreme power. They had nominated Nasir-ud-din as the future Khan, but as soon as they saw that want of courage would lead him to relinquish their cause, they gave him up at once, and themselves took the lead of that struggle, which is the most important effort that the Central Asiatics have hitherto made to resist their invaders. The plan of the insurgents, no doubt, was to drive out, not only Khudayar, but his Russian friends also, and not only from Kokand, but even from Tashkend -—nay, from the whole of Central Asia. The train of the plot, so cautiously laid, shows suffi cient skill. I he rising was to have taken place simultaneously in Kokand, in the adjoining Russian territory of Samarcand and Khojend, in Bokhara, and in the Steppes, but the gallant Kipchaks evidently forgot to consider that where the booming of Russian guns, and the deadly whistle of the rockets have once been heard, the cry for Gaza (holy war) will remain unanswered. And thus it happened, that whilst the eastern portion of old Farghana and of the Kuhistan, such as Macha, Abburdan, and other less accessible places, joined heartily in the fight against the invading unbeliever, the people in the immediate neighbour hood of Russian authority did not even venture to stir, and, in spite of promises, contributedtook [ cxciii ] but very little in money and presents towards the so-called “ bnl „ T sundry reports given in Russian papers of authority we are led f7l , Ju(i ? in ? ^om Khauof Kashgar, has also given secret support and enconrurp/ that Amu ' ^akub, Taken altogether, we must confess that the plan as formed W H ine - llt fc ? the n smg to Kokand.

On the 10th of Am,„^ renewed fights took place before the Nan-gate, on the 11th on the right bank of the Jaxartes and on the 12th near the village of Kostakaz, on the Kokand route, at which places, according to Russian information, the rebels were beaten, and repulsed with heavy losses. In’ default o^ other sources of information, we must credit the Russian official and semi-official reports; but on the other hand, we cannot but express our astonishment that the severely injured, and so frequently beaten Kokandians could have gathered sufficient strength to show such a’decided front at Mahram on the 22nd, which place the Russians had to take by assault, and then, after having wrested it out of the hands of its half-armed defenders, they had to continue an unceasing fight at every step in their invasion of the Khanate. I must confess I cannot share in the admiration General Kauffmann is so anxious to arouse by his loudly announced “ victory at Mahram, ” where, according to Russian reports, 50,000 Kokandians were put to flight by a brilliant cVann.es, executed from Karakchikum towards that fortress. We fully admit tuat Mahram, situated at the embouchures of the Upper Jaxartes valley, is of essential strategical value, and was recognized as such even by the uncivilized leaders of former wars, but I much doubt the number attributed to the Kokand army, for Aftabeji himself was unaware of the numerical strength of his forces, nor could it have been in his plan to lean on Mahram alto gether, which he must have found too far from the real centre of his strength, and which is in the neighbourhood of those towns, whose Tajik population was, from the beginning, hostile to his cause. The “battle of Mahram,” which may be properly styled the last scene of the first act in the bloody drama, produced so complete a change in the state of affairs that Aftabeji withdrew from the western part of Kokand, which he handed over to his enemies, and retired to the eastern and south-eastern districts to re-organize his strength. General Kauffmann, imagining that he was already in undisturbed possession of the country, sat down to dispose of the easily- won prize, and after annexing that portion of the Khanate which extends from the station of Abikhurek (“ drinkable water ”) to tlie embouchures of the Naryn, and which was always a harassing wedge between Khojend and the Government of Semiryeehensk, he magnanimously installed on his father’s throne Nasir-ud-din Khan, leaving it of course to the new Russian vassal himself to carry into effect this imperial favour, and to reconquer the capita from the hands of the Kipchaks, which, as we shall see, he never achieved. Asfor the nev y-annex« Russian territory, known formerly under the name of the country of Isiamangari ( 10 011 h in&lt;l . meaning of the word is Nemek-kan, being a salt mine) and divided into six districts we thmk it quite natural that the inhabitants of the towns, mostly industrious and peaceful lap-., should have submitted to the conqueror, and tried even to appease the anger of vmtonous unbeliever with 40,000 loaves of bread; but I beg leave to doubt the great amxic^ they are said to have manifested to come under Russian rule; oi sue a s a j tp e ; r strongly against the occurrences of a few weeks later, when hornble desire of getting rid of the foreign yoke.

During the nights of 9-10th September the pursuing and pursued came to a fight near the place called Mingtepe (thousand hills), and it is certainly a gross exaggeration when the Russians say that out of 10,000 followers of the Tatar Chief only 400 remained with him, whilst the rest, greatly alarmed by the unfortunate issue of the battle, left their leader. Such a statement ought not to be taken literally. When ^ftabeji retired it was his intention to reach the less accessible passes of Kara-Kulja, in the vicinity of Uzkend, which is the seat of his tribe (the Kugai), in order to gather strength, and to break forth at the proper time. Under these circumstances the follow- ing of all his adherents would have become de facto an impossibility, and it was not in consequence of secession, but of an order that every man looked for his own safety, and for temporary repose. When Skobelef, therefore, tired of the fruitless pursuit, returned from Ush to the head-quarters at Marghilan, Aftabeji not only did not disappear in the disguise of a dervish towards Mecca, as bazar gossips reported, but made all possible efforts to encourage his partisans for the last stroke, and to enter the arena for the second time. The Russians were fully employed settling the newly-annexed Namangan, in erecting forts, and in making themselves at home, when rumours spread of the breaking out of the flame which was believed to be extinguished. These reports, augmented from day to day, and made it unavoidably necessary again fo take the field, and to march against the united forces of Aftabeji and Pulad towards Andijan, where they were said to be at the head of more than 80,000 men. Admitting that the alleged number must be again reduced, it is nevertheless certain that General Trotzki, who commanded the expedition, had hard work before him. The storming of Andijan on the last day of September, and the subsequent fights of the 1st and 2nd October remind us vividly of the strenuous and life-despairing straggle of the zealous disciples of Sheik Shamil in Daghestan, and of the adherents of Abdel Kadir in Algeria. The Russian soldiers, in storming the place, had to take barricades and intrenchments, to fight for every step they made in advance, and when they reached the centre of the town, famous as the brith-place of Baber, they could not keep their position longer than one hour, and found themselves obliged to retrace their steps, in the face of the same difficulties, the same fightings, and the same bloodshed. Assuredly such a resist ance is no trifle, considering the military skill, and the superior arms of the Russians, as compared with the empty hands of the Tatar defenders. And still this unequal contest continued, with slight interruptions, for nearly four months ! On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of October continued fights took place between the retiring Russians and the pursuing Kipchaks on the route to Balikchi, whilst the 9th, 12th, and 13th of the same month are noted for i-isings in various places in the district of Namangan, the same country which, according to the Russians, only a few weeks ago, implored the Yarim-padishah (half-emperor, as General Kauffmann is commonly called) to bestow upon them the blessing of Muscovite rule. The villages of Naukend, Yenghi-kurgan, and Kasan were soon subdued by a military detachment under Colonel Fride, whilst Colonel Meller Zakamelski cleared the places called Karaskan and Kizil Rabat. But this did not break the heart of Batir Tor, the leader of this rising, for we meet with him again on the 22nd, in the fortress of Tere-Kurgan, 'which the Russians had to take by storm, with the same want of result as in the case of Andijan. The circumstance of having been twice repulsed from a position won by great sacrifices of course greatly injured Russian military influence, and it must be chiefly attributed to this loss of prestige that the Kipchaks, in company with the Kara-Kirghiz, far from feeling discouraged by the tremendous loss of life, instead of slackening their spirit of defence, grew the more desperate, and being beaten or driven away from one place, soon emerged with renewed strength, and with redoubled fury, at another. The cannonade of Tere-kurgan had not yet echoed away in the rocky valleys of the Alai, when in Namangan, where hundreds of hands helped to erect a fortress, or to put the old one in a position of defence, a rebellion broke out, and in the morning of the 24th thousands of Kipchaks, supported by the Namangauis, rushed towards the citadel occupied by the Russians. The assault was tried on three sides at once. The esplanade separating the citadel from the tower was crammed with the enraged assailants \ but, in spite of the deadly fire with which Colonel-Lieutenant Garnowsky, the commander of the place, received the storming masses, and notwithstanding the circumstance that the said esplanade was literally covered with Tatar corpses, the fight continued all day in the streets of Namangan, where barricades, entrenchments—nay, each house—had to be taken separately by the Russians. It was only on the 27th of October, after a bombardment of five hours* duration had shattered the whole town (said to contain 10,000 houses), and laid the bazar in ashes, that the Kipchaks retired. They needed rest, but their heroic spirit was not yet broken. Without dwelling on the various skirmishes that Colonel Pichughin, who was entrusted with the duty of keeping open the road between Namangan and Khojend, constantly had with marauding Kokandian parties, we must refer to the embittered fight at Balikchi, situated at the confluence of the Naryn and Kara-darya rivers, and therefore a place of strategical importance. The date of this serious affair is the 12th of November, and in reading the inimical, that is the Russian, report of that day, we cannot but admire Well Khan Tor, the Kipchak leader in that engagement, for his stubborn defence, and for the extraordinary courage which he as well as his ill-armed soldiers displayed. The details of that fight, in which the Russian had to storm the place, are more frightful, more appalling60 [ CXCY ] than those of Andijan. Tere-kuman and Namano-™ .in,, and all the leading officers, were found amongst the dead T , artar comr »ander their soldier-like behaviour. According to the sefni official ' C f rtain ! y ti:ie best testimony of Kipchafa ware 20,000 in number, aodlbei/lTKloS ^ ^ of the best modern construction. sXe it to sav that tl with «»* days again saw a bloody event, more like » onTanght than a bat^Tt C ^ point on the road to Bahkchi, Marghilan, and Kokand and that tl.o X’ f 1 Gurte P ( b a central lives. Things went on in this way, wiih shoKt K !P chaks a 8’ aia ^ st ^00 and it was only in January of 1876 that a continuous battle / ./• ^ ^ ™ ont l December, the left bank of the Jaxartfes, between Andijan and Khokand a fortnight, on ^11 the &lt;( Victory of 4sahe ” THp u-w m ' 1 and Khokand, ended with what the Russians ca. -the °i A TV . Wai t ° 4 f p means o£ ^fence, but not a relaxhm yieldinc, spnat forced the K.pchaks to succumb. Aftabeji, together with Batir Tor, Isfendim- Khalife Kul, Kazi Bek, Nai Muhummad, and others, tendered their arms to General Skobelef at Hmdi-Kishlak (a place about four miles from Andijan), submitting themselves and their country to the foreign conqueror Russia secured in this way, at least for the moment, the undisputed mastership of the whole Khanate. She found herself necessitated, by the ambition of her military officers, to take a step which is certainly not for her best interests, which was not on the line of her previously settled policy, and which is almost sure to be detrimental to her. Ibe annexation of the whole Khanate of Kokhand is a measure with which Russia has quite recently surprised the world. Kokand, almost the poorest of the three Khanates as regards population and cultivable soil, will prove a very heavy burden on the Russian exchequer, since the cost of governing a hardy warlike people like the Kipchaks and Kara-Kirghiz, cannot be even compaied with the expenses hitherto incurred in the administration of those towns and villages which are inhabited partly by Tajiks and Sarts, and party by Uzbegs. In spite of the present submission, there can be no doubt that the rocky passes of the Upper Naryn and of the Alai will become a second Caucasus for Russia, with the difference that the Sheikh Shamil of the future will be able to lean on a larger force of his co-religionists, and on a neighbouring Muhammadan power with the same intersts. The Russians will now learn that they, too, have vulnerable points, not only in Europe, but also in Asia, and that the time for self-control and moderation has finally come.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000912.0x0000ae_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/253</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x0000ae</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/253</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Précis of correspondence, &amp;c., relating to affairs in Central Asia, Biluchistan, Persia, &amp;c. 1875-77.
