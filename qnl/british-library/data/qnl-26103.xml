Tany thanks for year letter of 7th Dec., No. 17960/33, relative to the transfer of Aden. As regards the second para, of yoar letter, we agree that, ordinarily speaking, when reference is made by Indians to the position m ^enya, it is very relevant to draw attention to the fact that Indians enjoy equal rights m Ceylon, Mauritius and many other colonies. We will bear this point in whom a copy of your letter is being sent. In the memo, which the S. of S. put in to the Joint Select Committee w r e had at first thought of dealing with H'nVyv+vi-l. this peinC m greater detail than-wac ^'eventually decided in para. 8 of that memo. The reason why we decided not to do so was as follows. »/e might have drawn attention to the position of Indians m Ceylon, Mauritius, etc., air- pointed out that this is the correct analogy with Aden, and that the by Sethna and his friends betv/een Aden and Kenya is entirely fallacious, because there can never be any question of European colonisation at Aden. But in the course of any reasoned statement of this character it would have been necessary to say mind, a.s will the G. of I., to 1925 5000 6.33e- somothing abedt the position in Kenya, and we felt that it was very difficult for the S. of S. to say anything implying either that he admitted or denied the existence of Indian grievances in that colony. We therefore decided that it was better to say as little as possible in that memo., even though this involved brushing Sethna^ point asiae rather summarily. With reference to your official , • ft lo ^ ' printed letter, No. 17960/33, forwarding copy of a telegram dated 25th bov. from the Resident at Aden, and to the G. of I.'s telegram of 30th Nov., of which we sent you a copy with our printed letter, P.Z. 7793/33, of 4th Dec., could you let me know whether you agree to the representations received by Reilly from in due course t^o the J tS. tI should explain that the Committee has now completed the stage of its proceedings at which evidence is taken and published.

Dear Walton, A , *7 u- In reply to your letter of the 28th of H November, P.Z. 7493/33, enclosing correspondence with the Government of India on the subject of the transfer of Aden, we can certainly give an assurance that in the event of transfer there will be no racial dis crimination either in legislation or in administration against Indian British subjects in Aden. In this connection I would suggest that when attention is drawn to the position of Indians in Kenya, where the circumstances are wholly exceptional, reference might well be made in reply to the position in such Colonies as Mauritius and Ceylon, where resident British Indians have full civic rights and Indians, whether resident or not, are subjected to no disabilities in comparison with any other British subjects.

Sethna, O.B.E., on the future constitution of Aden, followed by a Memorandum by the jcretary of State for India. ^ ei As the British India Delegation complete their discussions with the Joint Select Parliamentary Committee to-day and there is no time left it has been suggested that I might submit a memorandum for the consideration of the Joint Select Parliamentary Committee in regard to Aden. The last para graph of Proposal 5 on page 38 of the White Paper reads as follows: — “ The Settlement of Aden is at present a Chief Commissioner’s Pro vince. The future arrangements for the Settlement are, however, under consideration, and accordingly no proposals in respect of it are included in this document.” In the Council of State the Leader of the House, Khan Bahadur Mian Sir Fazl-i-Husain, on 31st August, 1933, moved “ That the Government of India communique, dated 20th June, 1933, regarding the future administra tion of Aden be taken into consideration.” This gave an opporDmity to discuss the Press communique when I moved my substitution motion which was as follows : — “ This Council after duly considering the Government of India Press Communique of 20th June, 1933, submits that whilst no longer object ing to the transfer to Imperial control of the Political and military administration of Aden as it exists at present, it is definitely of opinion that its Civil Administration should be continued with the Government of India or if thought necessary should be retransferred to the Govern ment of Bombay, but that such Civil Administration not be transferred to the Colonial Office.” As the speech I made in support of my motion explains our view point I cannot do better than reproduce it in full. I said: — “ (Mr. President, the Honourable the Leader of the House has told us the object of the motion which he has placed before this Council this morning. He said that it is in accordance with the obligation Government entered into, namely, that the question of the transfer of Aden from the Govern ment of India to the Colonial Office would only be undertaken after the Indian Legislature were given an opportunity of discussing it. For this favour we are very grateful to Government although I may be permitted to point out that on a previous occasion, in spite of similar assurances, Govern ment did not carry out such an arrangement and to which I will refer a little later. “ The Honourable the Leader of the House has referred to the Resolution that I moved in this Council on the 26th September, 1921. It reads as follows: — “ ‘ This Council recommends to the Governor General in Council that a representation be made to the Secretary of State for India that the administration of Aden be continued under the Government of India and not be transferred to the Colonial Office.’ “ As the Honourable Sir Fazl-i-Husain has told us, on that occasion Government very kindly, and very rightly, requested Government Members not to take part in the discussion or in the voting. We are extremely indebted to the Honourable Sir Fazl-i-Husain for assuring us that the same procedure will be followed in the course of the discussion this morning. The Honourable Sir Fazl-i-Husain added that the then Leader, the late Sir2 RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20 c Novcmbris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir. Phiroze [Continued. C.

Muhammad Shafi, at the end of the debate surveyed the whole situation and stated that Government were going to observe perfect neutrali*^ in the matter. Sir Muhammad Shah’s words will bear repetition, and be fore, with your permission, propose to quote them. He said: — “ ‘ I can assure the House that the Government of India will take note of the opinions expressed in this House by various Members repre senting different interests. They will note the fact that Indian senti ment according to the various speakers is entirely opposed to this transfer. They will also take note of the fact, which has been positively stated by the Honourable Mr. Sethna and. is endorsed by the Bombay Government that local opinion in Aden as well as in Bombay is also opposed to the transfer. They will further take note of the fact stated by the Honourable Rai Bahadur Lala Ram Saran Das, that in view of the position which Indians at present occupy in different parts of Africa—parts that are under the control of the Colonial Office—Indians would prefer that Aden—their brethren, their country men, residing in Aden—should remain under the control of the Govern ment of India rather than that Aden should be transferred to the control of the Colonial Office. All these sentiments which have been expressed in the various speeches delivered by Honourable Members to-day will, the House may rest assured, be carefully borne in mind by the Government of India. The Government of India have not yet pronounced in favour of this transfer and until they do, no Honourable Member has any right to assume that they are in favour of that pro position. Their position is, as announced by the Honourable the Foreign Secretary, one of benevolent neutrality 7 towards the Resolution moved by the Honourable Mr. Sethna. They prefer to leave this Resolution to the vote of the House. The official Members will take no part in the voting and Government will undoubtedly pay due regard to the final verdict of this House upon the Resolution moved by my Honourable friend.’ “ Mr. President, if this was the view that the Council held in September, 1921, I think I am perfectly justified in stating that the Council holds not only the same view to-day 7 but holds it in a greatly intensified form. (Hear- hear.) Sir, even after 1921, there were occasional reports that Aden was going to be transferred, and in order to make sure on the point, questions were asked both in this House and in another place to which very definite replies were given by Government which I will quote. On 16th 'January, 1922, the then Law Member, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, in the Legislative Assembly said : — Government have no intention of arriving at any decision without giving the Assembly an opportunity of discussion.’ Two years later, on 9th June, 1924, in answer to a question in this House^Sir John Thompson, the Foreign Secretary, observed as follows: — ^ tter of the transfer was under the consideration of His i ajesty s Government and it was not possible to say when a decision would be arrived at but that before a final decision was arrived at, the Indian Legislature would be given an opportunity to express its opinion.’ Such an oppoitunity, however, was not given to us, and this is where Government committed a breach of faith with the Legislature. On 3rd March, 1927, the then Commander-in-Chief, speaking on the Budget debate,ON INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 3 ^nfi'ts Abbs. seimt on, aBj')- ndia nl; ilemktis i Man iPod it; lich k ;■ s endot*: as wel i ther tsbi la Easi St sent oai! oftleCe their« 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued. c.

It came as a bolt from the blue. His Excellency said that the military and political adi^istration of Aden had been definitely transferred to the Home Cov- enflbt, and this, as I say, without any previous reference to the legis lature. Sir, this was not enough. The announcement went on to add as follows:— . “ ‘ As Honourable Members are aware, the Settlement of Aden itself is peopled to a very great extent by our fellow Indian subjects. The Government of India have thought it right that their welfare and interests should not go outside the ken of the Government of India, it will accordingly be retained; that part of the Settlement and ^the municipality of Aden will remain under the Government of India. “ I would ask the House to note very carefully that what I am pro posing in my motion to-day is in substance what the Commander-in-Clnet announced as I have just stated. “ The Commander-inAUhief’s announcements surprised the Assembly and it is no wonder that in both the Houses there was very severe criticism of the attitude of Government in regard to this matter. Not only was the Indian Legislature kept in the dark, but even the Provincial Government immediately concerned, namely, that of Bombay, was entirely m the dark, and that in spite of the fact that the Government of India knew the views of the Government of Bombay on the question. In this House we have official representatives of the different Provincial Governments. We a not often favoured with an opportiunity of hearing their voices, and it i only on very rare occasions, and when such Provincial Governments think that it is absolutely necessary in the interests of such Provmcia 1 Gover ments that their view should be placed before the House, that their repre sentatives do get up and talk. Such was an occasion when A moved y Resolution in September, 1921. The then representative of the Bom my Government, the Honourable Mr. Pratt, a Member of the ^an Civil Service, used words which showed the feeling which ne ., Bombay entertained on the question of the transfer o cen. “ ‘ The transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office is a qiuestion in which the Government of Bombay is deeply and closely interested. Towards that question the attitude of the Bombay Government cannot m any circumstances be one of neutrality and I have been authorised to give expression to the provisional views of the Bombay Government a i stage of the discussion of this question. Their position is that they have had very little notice and indeed very little time for the co- sideration of this question. They have had very little information of the grounds upon which the transfer has been considere . is a so a that public opinion both in Bombay and Aden has expressed very strongly against the proposed transfer. Very s rong pr s been recorded by the trading communities of Bombay and Aden, and that reason for the present the Bombay Government objects to a y change in the status quo.’ “ Now Sir the Bombay Government have not changed their views as is evident fVomVhatf„Tw«l in the Bombay Council exactly a week after the announcement made by His Excellency the tommander^m-Chief in the Assembly. That announcement, as I have already sa.d wan made ^3.d March 1927 On 10th March, 1927, the Home Member of the Bombay Government Sir Ernest Hotson, introduced a Bill called the Aden Civil anTcririnkl Justice Bill in the Bombay Council and m regard to the A 2 193564 RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued. C. Sethna, O.B.E., on the Future Constitution of Aden, statement made by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Ernest said that the announcement came as a surprise to the Government of Bombay as much as to the general public. “ ‘ I am obliged to stress this point,’ said Sir Ernest, ‘ because cL-fng the discussion on the Bill both I and my Honourable Friend the Chief Secretary assured several Honourable Members that we had no reason to suppose that a transfer was imminent, and indeed pointed to the fact that the Government of India had. instructed us to proceed with the Bill as evidence that no immediate change was proposed. The details of the future system of administration at Aden are not yet known to the Government of Bombay, which indeed knows nothing further than what has appeared in the Press.’ “ This Sir, proves my statement that even the Provincial Government most directly concerned with the transfer 'was kept entirely in the dark. “ This was, as I have said in 1927. In January, 1929, when there were fresh rumours of the transfer, questions were again asked and Sir Denys Bray gave a reply which consisted of two sentences which are very pertinent and to which I would respectfully request the earnest attention of Members of this Honourable Council. The first sentence was: — “ ‘ I repeat my promises that the transfer of Aden from India will not be effected without this House being taken into consultation.’ “ Mark the words ‘ my promises,’ which I may add were not fulfilled. The next sentence is still more pertinent. He said: — “ ‘ I hasten to add that all idea of such a transfer has long since been abandoned.’ “ Two years later, v/hen the Aden administration was proposed to be transferred from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India there were also rumchirs of a subsequent transfer from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. Thereupon those interested in the Aden trade thought it necessary to wait in a deputation on His Excellency the Viceroy. The deputation was a very influential and representative one. It waited on His Excellency Lord Willingdon in November, 1931. The deputation pointed out to the Viceroy that it was feared that in all probability the ti ansfer from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India was the thin end of the wedge and that it was but the first step to its subse quent transfer to the Colonial Office. Now, Sir, mark the reply which on behalf of the Viceroy the then Foreign Secretary, now Sir Evelyn Howell, gave to the deputation. He said, as regards the apprehension that the proposed transfer was only a step towards the transfer of control to the Colonial Office, that the present proposals were made solely with a view to imploding the conditions and making an end of administrative incon venience at Aden. The proposals were complete in themselves and were made on tkei own merits without afterthought or ulterior motives of any kind. The were not a step towards any other change.’ “ The deputation at first thought that His Excellency would not tab P f a ^ m , th ® discussion, but His Excellency, in order to allay the feai of the deputation, himself thought fit to add a few words. He emphaticall endorsed the Foreign Secretary’s statement regarding the transfer to tl Colomal Office that no such suggestion had been considered and mndertoo that, should it arise in future, all interests concerned would be consultsON INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM M Abb t said I; obay ast; ‘becaiii 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued.

The only reference to Aden in the White Paper is in four lines, which read as follows : — “ ‘ The Settlement of Aden is at present a Chief Commissioner’s province. The future arrangements for the Settlement are however under consideration, and accordingly no proposals in respect of it are included in this document.’ “ Soon thereafter several British-Indian delegates were sent to London to confer with the members of the Joint Select Committee of Parliament, of whom I was one. After we reached London we learned that there was every chance now of the transfer to the Colonial Office being completed. Some of us delegates therefore thought it advisable to request an interview with the Right Honourable the Secretary of State. He agreed to receive our deputation which was led by His Highness the Aga Khan. We laid our case before him and from what we gathered we understood that he was in sympathy with the view we expressed. But at the same time he pointer olut that because there was to be federation in India hereafter, which would consist only of Provinces and of Indian States, and because Aden was not a Province the question was very difficult. At the same time he hoped that the difficulty might not be insurmountable. How he hoped to surmount the difficulty he did not say, but if I might venture an opinion l think that if Aden continued as before to remain tunder the Province or Bombay perhaps the difficulty could be removed. It is for that reason, Sir, that in my substituted motion I have said that if thought necessary the civil administration of Aden might be re-transferred to the Bombay Government. “ Now, Sir, I turn to the Press communique to which the Honourable Leader of the House drew our pointed attention, and particularly to those points in it which he tholught we ought not to ignore in the course of our discussion. In the first place, I will deal with the three points in the communique as to why Aden should not remain linked with India. Point No. 1 says that Aden is geographically remote from India. If it is 1,600 miles away from India, the distance between Aden and the Colonial Office is two-and-a-half times that. I will leave it to the House to consider if this argument is sound. The next point is that it would not naturally fit into the new federation. I have already answered this contention by saying that even in the opinion of no less a personage than the Right Honourable the Secretary of State that difficulty is not insurmountable. I now come to the third point, and that is that it is already to some extent hinder Imperial control. The answer to that is that if it has passed out of our contro , it was not with our agreement, it was so done over our heads and in spite of our protests. We are however now quite prepared to concede that for political and military considerations Aden may remain under the Imperial control. “ Then there are six points enumerated in the communique according to which Government try to make out that India would not be a loser has laid particular stress is that India will be saved a burden of Rs. 20 lakhs ^ r. u t&gt;„ on i v-»rl T eVio 11 nnHnnvmir i,n Drove il6 RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued, C.

Now, against this Rs. 20 lakhs Government must set off what the Government of India tvill lose in the shape of the revenJue which it derives from salt and also from income and super-tax. I make out roughly that Government will lose Rs. 10 lakhs under the heads I have quoted. Let me give you the details under the heading Salt. With regard to salt, the Government of India get a royalty of eight annas for every ton of salt exported. According to the latest figures, the export of salt in a period of 12 months amounted to over 280.000 tons and consequently Government will lose Rs. 1,40,000. Government also get ground rent for land where the salt is made which is another loss of Rs, 25,000, or in all Rs. 1,65,000. Again, so far as I can ma e out, the four salt factories in Aden pay between them income tax and sluper-tax to the extent of Rs. 3^ lakhs or more, so that the total of these two items a one exceeds Rs. 5* lakhs. I explained that the Govern- mentof India wall lose Rs. 10 lakhs, and I pointed out how the loss is Ks - % lakhs or more under salt alone. The difference between Rs. 10 lakhs a a s. O4 Uiv is is made up by the amount of income tax and super-tax unc ci iea s ot icr than Salt. My estimate is on the conservative side and perhaps Government may lose more.

The communique says that a proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in the Ac en ser'rtfci—and please note—‘ a proportion ’ will be retained and the rest wiL be l t away, and even the proportion that is retained will be retained for some years/ which means that at the earliest opportunity they will be asked to go away. And what is more important, in the future under the Colonial administration no more Indians will be taken, which will also be some little loss to this country in the matter. “ Then there is the last item, which is perhaps the most important of all. It is said no racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government. Now, Sir, we have very grave doubts if in spite of this assurance that Government will be able to maintain this promise for long. I will tell you why? His Majesty’s Government must carry out a uniform Colonial policy. If they favour and discriminate in favour of Asiatics in Aden, there is bound to be a clamour on the part of Europeans in the other Colonies to which Government will have to yield as they have yielded in the past and they are yielding every day. Therefore these assurances are all paper assurances. They will last only for months or years and the position of Indians in Aden will become the same as the position of Indians in Kenya or other Colonies. And that, Six, is our most serious objection to the transfer. Experience tells us that we have suffered else where and we are bound to suffer here as well, in spite of all promises and pledges to the contrary. “ Now, Mr. President, I will in accordance with your wishes be brief, although I have much more material to add. I will enumerate the objec tions which we entertain against the proposed transfer. I hey are many, but I will content myself at present with only five. “ First. It has been said that we are fighting and agitating against this proposed transfer merely on the ground of sentiment. If we do so, are we not justified? Indians have been in Aden even before the British went there. The British acquired Aden 94 years ago in 1839. Indians were there before that time and because of the encouragement given by British officers more Indians followed the British flag and particularly because they had assurances that Aden would ever remain a part of the Indian Empire. If they at any time had any doubts on the subject, because of Indian experience in other Colonies they would never have sunk their lakhs as they have done in buildings, shipping wharves, salt factories and in othei concerns. They control in a great measure the trade of the Settlement. It will be no exaggeration to say that the barren rock of Aden with hei population of 3,000 inhabitants has been converted into a prosperous port with a population of more than half a lakh by Indian men and money, ox Indian resources and enterprise. It is therefore the duty of the Govern ment to give us a patient hearing and to do us justice. We do not want to go under Colonial administration because we know that in that event Indians will have to leave the Settlement for reasons that I will deal wit i in our second objection to which I now turn. “ Near Aden, as the Honourable House knows, is Somaliland. Somaliland was at one time administered by the Bombay Government. So long as it was administered by the Bombay Government, its three ports, Berbera, Bulhar and Zaila, were prosperous. They were going on from strength to strength. After the Somaliland War the Home Government thought it right to transfer Somaliland to the Colonial Office. With what result, Mr.&lt;.u JVovembns, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Cotitimued. C. Sethna, O.B.E., on the Future Constitution of Aden. President? These three ports are now practically dead. The population of Berbera has fallen from about 20,000 to 4,000 or less and likewise the others. And why, may I ask? Simply -because the Indian traderjpdeft these ports and the Arab and Jewish traders followed in their wake. ,,liey did so for the same reason, namely, that they did not want to be under Colonial administration. Colonial administration is distinctly costly Because it is costly taxes have to be raised. The Somaliland ports were almost free ports but soon duties were imposed and increased to meet the higher cost of administration and the result was Indian, Arab and Jewish traders left and the trade of these ports has completely dwindled down the same must perforce happen in Aden if Aden is transferred to the Co omal Office and I may not be alive, but our successors in this House will have occasion to say that I was a true prophet.

C. Sethna, O.B.E., ON THE Future Constitution ot Aden. is sent from there to Arabian, African and even Iraq provinces. My point therefore is that if Indians leave Aden as they are hound to, this large trale will be lost to India. You may naturally inquire, why should not other traders take their place? I say they will not. Indians conduct their business on different lines. Those who come m their place will not do the business on a credit basis same as the Indians do. “ Our fifth objection is that, if Aden is not included in India and is transferred to the Colonial Office, then, because Aden salt pays only- excise duty and not protective duty when it comes to India, the salt- industry in Aden is bound to be crushed out of existence. Tnese factories will be closed down and the lakhs sunk in them be lost, but what is of great importance, and which I would ask Government to bear m mind, is that out of Aden’s population of over 50,000, there are 2,500 Arabs who work in the four salt factories there and this large number will be without employment. Sir, I can easily multiply these reasons for objecting to the proposed transfer, but I will not take up any more time of t xe ounc. “ I will now just briefly refer to one objection in connection with my original Resolution of 1921 raised by Sir Denys Bray. He expressed the fear at that date that the Arabs and Jews were siding with the Indians but how long would the Arabs do so? He thought that as soon as the Arabs are educated, they would not join forces with the Indians. The long period of 12 years has elapsed since then. The Arabs have not watered in their affection and in their regard and sympathy with Indians and foi good reasons they as well as the Jews prefer to act in concert with them. They know that the presence of Indians help them and therefore there is no talk and no fear of their not helping the Indians. I know when I was in London some months ago much capital was made of a small petition signed by 32 people and sent to the Viceroy through the Chief Commis sioner of Aden. That was a petition signed not by pure Adenites but by 32 Arabs who came from the hinterland. As soon as it was discovered that such a representation had been sent, the regular Arab traders got together and within a few days sent another representation signed not by 32 Arabs but by 500 Arabs disclaiming what was said by the 32. “ And what about our Jewish friends? The Jews in Aden are not Jews from the Levant as they are in South Africa, and where they are favoured and treated as Europeans. The Jews in Aden are Baghdadi Jews, and as much Asiatics as the Indians or the Arabs there. Both the Arabs and the Jews know just as well as we do of the Colonial policy to which I have . - t-, TJ. J. Xl.« crimination in favour of the white man against the Asiatic. We full well realise that no matter what professions or promises are made to-day they are bound to be broken. The Home Government must create some excuse or other to meet the wishes of Europeans in other parts of the Empire to see that no favour is extended to Asiatics in Aden which is not extended to them in other Colonies. “ I said, Sir, in the earlier part of my speech that the political and military administration is already taken away from the Government of India. We recognise that the British Empire is great and that it must have military outposts both near and far. Aden may well be regarded as the Gibraltar of the East so far as the British Empire is concerned. We certainly have a grievance that the transfer of the political and military10 RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sib Phikoze [Continued. C. Sethna, O.B.E., on the Futuke Constitution of Aden. administration was made without our consent and without our knowledge, but India is a member of the great British Empire and for that reason we no longer press for the return to this country of what is already transfacred in the way of the political and. military administration. So far a „.lie civil administration is concerned ;we protest and protest most stoutly for the reasons 1 have endeavoured to place before the Council. “I do hope, Sir, that Government will accede to our wishes and keep the civil administration with the Government of India or if necessary with the Government of Bombay. It is one thing for Government to ask for our opinion and quite another if Government do not give heed to that opinion. We do hope that the Leader of the House will give us an assur ance that if the view held by the Legislature is against the transfer that Government will consider itself hound to respect the wishes of the Legisla ture and their wishes are what is practically desired by the country at large.” * .. cu pcx UllIYril u iU U 110111 IIP speech of the Honourable Mr. B. K. Basu. It is as follows: — “ l Si r , the real excuse that I have for intervening in this debate i that I am suffering^ from some intellectual tortures ever since I rea&lt; this communique. First, as was very ably traversed by Sir Phirozi Sethna, I find the words ‘ geographically remote ’ giving me one o those tortures because when I find that we have places under thi administration of the Government of India which are more or less shall I say fortunately or unfortunately, placed in the same positioi as Aden. Take, for example, the island of Andamans. It is in th very same inconvenient or convenient geographical position. Geo graphically, the Andamans is nearer to Ceylon than to India. Wb does not the Colonial Government say, ‘Give us the Andamans?’ Wi ni e g ad to make a present of it to them; we would not stand ii their way Secondly, the commiunique says that Aden will not natural! into le new federation.

The Press communique of 20th June, 1933, was as follows. His Majesty’s Government have recently received representations from different communities among the inhabitants of Aden as well as from certain quarters in India, expressing their various views m regard to the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of Int la to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connection with the impending constitutional changes, lull oppor tunity will be given for discussion in the India Legislative Chambers a their next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenien that the considerations which suggest the desirability of a transfer ot tne administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a trans ei should be made known so that the problem can be discussed with a full knowledge of the facts. T ^i- The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India .under the new constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the new federationthat it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is in separable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it should be decided that the adminis tration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty s Government contemplate that the following conditions would be estab lished:— , £ (1) India would be relieved of the annual contribution ot appioxi- mately £150,000 sterling, or Its. 20 lakhs, at present payable towards the military and political administration. , (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Uourt would be maintained. . r (3) His Majesty’s Government wciuld maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. From their own point ot view the abandonment of this policy would clearly m existing economic con ditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largelv on its transit trade. . (4) His Majestv’s Government would do their utmost to maintain the present standard'of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. . . (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel wdiuid be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place. (6) No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by Mis Majesty’s Government.12 RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ADEN. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India. 1. I desire to make it clear at the outset that the note which expresses views about the future of Aden which I wish to lay before •’% colleagues of the Joint Committee at this stage for their consideration. The nature of the recommendations to be made to Parliament is a matter for the decision of the Joint Committee, and that decision cannot, of course, be compromised in any way by anything I say now. History. 2. Aden has been an important entrepot of trade since early times—at any rate since the early centuries of Islam. In 1513 it was attacked unsuccessfully by Albuquerque. In 1538 it was acquired by the Turks as a base of operations against the Portuguese, and belonged to them until 1630. Subsequently it was possessed by various Arab Chiefs until 1839, when it was captured by the British with a force of 300 European and 400 Indian troops. The occasion of its capture was an outrage on the passengers and crew of a British buggalow wrecked in the neighbourhood. The East India Company, however, had already in 1829 contemplated making it a coaling station, but at that time had abandoned the idea, owing to the difficulty of procuring labour. Perim, which now forms part of the Aden Settlement, had been occupied by the British in 1799 as a precaution against the possible descent of Napoleon on India, but was subsequently abandoned till 1857, when it was reoccupied. It will thus be seen (a) that Aden has always been a place of general strategic importance, and (b) that it has been for centuries an Arab town. Population. 3. The population of the Aden Settlement (excluding Perim, a population of 1,700) at the 1931 census was as follows: — Arabs Indians Jews Somalis Europeans Miscellaneous ... which has 29,820 7,287 4,120 3,935 1,145 331 Total .. 46,638 Thus about 64 per cent, of the population is Arab as against about 15 per cent. Indian. Ihe total area of the Settlement is 75 square miles and of Perim five square miles. ~ ~ j wj vi wivsjiyi. 4. Speeches delivered in the debates in the Indian Council of State on Au f ust a nd ^ the Legislative Assembly on 16th and 18th September, 1 . 9 , 33&gt; re f erred t0 tlie history of the various recent steps taken in regard to Aden. Some of these speeches seem to indicate that there is a mistaken impression that His Majesty’s Government have led up to the present proposal by a series of faits accomplis. In order to correct any such impressions, it may be desirable to summarise the recent history of the question and the present position.ON INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 13 20° Novembris , 1933.] Memorandum by the [Continued. . Secretary of State for India. (i) The political and military administration of Aden has been con trolled by His Majesty’s Government since 1917, when it was taken j^over as a war measure. A prolonged discussion as to the financial and administrative responsibility followed the War, and was finally set Lied by a Cabinet decision of December, 1926, on a basis financially fai more favourable to India than previous proposals made by the Colonial Office; the civil (i.e., internal municipal) administration of the Settle ment was left with India, and the political control (i.e., sole responsi bility for the Protectorate) and military control with His Majesty’s Gov ernment, who took over the military and political charges with the aid o an annual contribution from Indian revenues (of £250,000 a yeai for the first three years, and after that one-third of the total annual cost, subject to a maximum of £150,000 a year). India’s present habi ity under this head is about £120,000, but as Sir George Schuster pointed out in the Assembly, it might at any time rise to £150,000. Pledges have been given by the Government of India from time to time t mt le civil administration will not be transferred to His Majesty’s Government without the Legislature and the interests concerned being given an opportunity of expressing their views. In 1931 it was decided, as a measure of administrative convenience, to transfer the administration from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India, and this transfer was made with effect from 1st April, 1932. In Noyem er, 1931, Lord Willingdon and Sir E. Howell (then Foreign Secretary to the Government of India) stated to a deputation that this change did not affect the question of transfer to the Colonial Office and was no a step towards any other change. That statement was correct; t e decision taken in 1931 was taken simply as a matter of administrative convenience; and if it had not been taken, the constitutiona ques ion which has now arisen would have had to be considered none the less. (ii) Until progress had been made with consideration of the present proposals for Indian constitutional reform, no question arose of revis ing the decision of 1926 regarding Aden. But as the proposals for an Indian Federation with responsibility at the centre took clearer shape, i became obvious that the question of Aden would have again to e considered with a view to deciding whether the continuance of t e existing arrangements would be practicable if the Government of India were converted into a Federal Government. Hence the statement in the White Paper that the future arrangements for _ the Aden Settle ment are under consideration. On 30th May I received a deputation led by His Highness the Aga Khan, of which Sir P. Sethna was spokes man/ I noted the views of the deputation and gave them the assurance that no decision would be taken before discussion in the Indian Legis a- ture, and furthermore that, whatever the decision mig t e, every care would be taken to safeguard existing interests so far as it lay in the power of His Majesty’s Government to do so. At the same time I suggested to the deputation, as matter for reflection, the diffi culties of fitting Aden into the proposed Indian Federation. (iii) Subsequently, in order that the question might be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests concerned with a full knowledge of the facts, His Majesty’s Government authorised the state ment published on 19th June (appended to this memorandum and issued in India as the communique of 20th June, which is appended to Sir P. Sethna’s memorandum), stating the considerations which suggest the14 RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by the [Continued. Secretary of State for India. desirability of the transfer of Aden and the conditions and assurances which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give if transfer takes place. Since then opportunity has been given, as promised, for &gt;dl discussion in both Chambers of the Indian Legislature, and steps Lve been taken to elicit the wishes of the Arab population of Aden itself. (iv) Thus we now have available all the material required for a full consideration of the question. For my own part I have carefully studied the debates in the Legislature and need hardly say that I attach great weight to the views expressed therein, but I have also had to consider most anxiously the wLole question in the light of all the facts, the various and extensive interests involved, and the views expressed in various q-uarters. Difficulty of placing civil administration under Indian Federal Government. 5. The debates in the Indian Legislature indicate that the true nature of the difficulties of fitting Aden into the proposed Indian Federation may not have been fully appreciated. The only difficulty mentioned in the ebates was the fact that Aden is now a Chief Commissioner’s Province directly under the Government of India, and members naturally asked why thm difficulty could not be met by retJurning Aden to the Government of Bombay and making it again part of the Bombay Presidency. It is therefore desirable that I should explain more fully the underlying reasons for the assertions in my statement of 19th June, that Aden “would not naturally fit into the new Federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control.” they are as follows. ft W( ? ul i d be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a clean sepa- p r eU o ^ t0Wn of Aden and its Arab hinterland, the Aden Protectorate. Similarly, it would be impracticable to effect a complete divorce between the civil administration of the Settlement on the one hand and the political and military control of the Protectorate on the other, or many purposes the whole area forms a single whole. At present there tl i € i C1V , 1 administ ration of the Settlement being controlled both S’ f P° dtlca cont J ro1 the Protectorate and the defence of there nre g / Tf 6 ' His ^^ty’s Government.

Secretary of State for India. stitutionally anomalous if the Settlement became part of a semi-autonomous Indian Federation. Such a constitutional anomaly would he removed by the Transfer of military control to India but this solution is ruled out by the i' ▼Mrements of Imperial Defence. Imperial Interests. 6. The strategic position of Aden, and its importance from this point of view to the Empire in the East generally and not merely to any single Empire unit, is a strong argument for control by the Home Government This by itself might be viewed as a decisive objection to the retention o the existing condominium when once the new constitution is established m India. Aden, in fact, besides its importance to the Empire as a refuelling station, is of greater general strategic importance to Imperial communica tions and to the Empire as a whole than to India by itself; moreover, Aden (Settlement plus Protectorate, which for this purpose are an integral whole) is of political importance with regard to Arabia. Arab Interests. 7. One of the most important factors to be considered is the interests of the Arab majority of the Aden population. In the Indian egis a ure reference was made to resolutions against transfer purporting to icpiesen the views of the Arabs as well as of the Indians. Hut since the publication of my statement of 19th June, the object of which was to elicit Arab as well as Indian opinion, I have been at pains to obtain from the Cue om missioner a report on the real wishes of the Arabs. The Chief Commissioner reports that the Arab community are as a whole satisfied with the exis ing state of affairs (i.e., with an administration controlled throng tie ov ernment of India by His Majesty’s Government), but that they view with grave misgivings the possibility that the Government of Aden leconie Indianised as the result of constitutional changes in India, and ear ie subordination of Arab to Indian interests; and (since a continuance o ne present state of affairs would in any case be made impossible &gt;y t ie OI _ 1 coming Indian Reforms) they would on the whole prefer that t e ar minis tration of Aden should henceforth be controlled by His Majesty s Govern ment direct. Fear of racial discrimination. 8. One of the fears expressed in the Indian Legislature was that Minder Crown Colony Government Indians would saiffer from racial discrimination. This is really answered by the categorical assurance which I gave on 19th June that, as one of the conditions of transfer, “ No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government. There is no parallel at all between the situation in Aden and that in Kenya whic has been referred to in the debates in the Indian Legislature. Financial effect of transfer. 9. In the Council of State debate, Sir P. Sethna suggested that, if the civil administration of Aden is transferred, India would lose Rs. 10 lakhs revenue from salt, income tax and super-tax, to set off against the saving on the military contribution. This point was dealt with by Sir G. Schuster in the Legislative Assembly. India would save the military contribution which in 1930-31 was £150,000 (20 lakhs), in 1931-32 £136,000, and in 1932-33 about £120,000 (according to the preliminary figures), and might in any year rise again to the maximum of £150,000. On the other hand, as16 EECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by the [Continued. Secretary of State for India. regards the civil administration, she would hand over an approximately even balance. The actual figures of civil revenue and expenditure for the years from 1927-28 to 1933-34 are as follows:— ^ Years. 1927- 28 1928- 29 1929- 30 1930- 31 1931- 32 1932- 33 (revised) 1933- 34 (budget) Revenue.

For the year 1932-33 there was a comparatively large surp us o Rs. 2.62 lakhs, due to the rise in income tax receipts in Aden ' Tliei ' e was a sma11 and Precarious surplus in 1931-32 of Rs. 0.65 lakhs and in 1933-34 (budget estimate) of Rs. 0.86 lakhs due to retrenchments. The only qualification of the statement that an approxi mately even balance would be handed over is that some part of the income ax paid m India in respect of Aden may be lost under the provisions tor relief from double income tax; the Government of India are naturally unable to give any exact estimate of this figure, but say that they may have to lose a lakh or two wn^lrl 1 ?, has also be « n su gg ested that if Aden is transferred, Indian trade Hip ° S +i ^ nc ian merchants would leave and that this has been t!l +W d °f q! tran 1 sfe *; of Somaliland to the Colonial Office in 1905.

If Aden is separated, it jvill be for the Indian Legislature of the future to decide what terms si^d he accorded to salt from Aden. The concern shown in the recent debates in the Indian Legislature for the commercial and other interests of Indians at Aden seems to give some ground for hoping that, as I sincerely trust may be the case, the Legislature would not be unresponsive to any appeal on behalf of the Aden salt manufacturers. Misunderstanding of the assurances in the statement of 19th June. 12. The conditions contemplated by His Majesty’s Government in the statement of 19th June in the event of transfer are in my view generous and ought to meet any reasonable apprehensions on the part of the Indian interests concerned. The speeches in the Legislature showed that there are certain misunderstandings as to the meaning of these conditions. Those regarding the contribution and the promise that there would be no racial discrimination have been dealt with above. Assurance No. 2 that a right of appeal would continue to lie to the Bombay High Court, has been included among the assurances in the interests of Aden litigants. An undue amount of attention has, I think, been directed to the qualified form of assurances 3 (maintenance of the free port) and 4 (maintenance of the present standard of administration wdthout imposing additional taxa tion). As regards 3, I would emphasise, v'hat is stated in the assurance, that from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government themselves the abandonment of the policy of a free port would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. The assurance that the policy would be main tained was only qualified by the words “ unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place.” I think that critics of this qualification may have overlooked the word “ radical.” Assurance No. 4 “ not to impose any additional taxation ” was qualified by the words “ unless such a course became, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, absolutely necessary.” This is an obviously necessary qualification, as His Majesty’s Government could not bind themselves in such a matter for ever. The wording of assurance No. 5, “A proportion of Indian service adminis trative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place,” has been misunderstood. The meaning was that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would continue to - to tbe Indian Service for some years. In the Indian Legislature it has been interpreted to mean that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained foi some years, and that the remainder would be sent away. In order to make more explicit the meaning of this assurance, I may say that His Majesty s Government are prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they wmre then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent; when vacancies occurred, Indians would remain eligible for appointment (though there would be a gradual substitution of Colonial Service officers); it would be understood that all newcomers to the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms to be agreed upon in each case, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service, unless these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment.(19356-50) Wt. 1141-379 1000 P.

His Majesty’s Government are also prepared to give a silicic additional assurance that in the event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same con ditions as any other British subjects. APPENDIX. Statement in answer to a question by Mr. David Grenfell in the House of Commons, Dated 19th June, 1933. Sir S. Hoare : His Majesty’s Government have recently received repre sentations from different communities among the inhabitants of Aden as well as from certain quarters in India, expressing their various views in regard to the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connection with the impending constitutional changes. Full opportunity will be given for discussion in the Indian legis lative Chambers at their next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views. Meanwhile, His Majesty v s Government think that it would be convenient that the considerations which suggest the desirability of a transfer of the administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer should be made known so that the problem can be discussed with a full knowledge of the facts. The reasons which suggest that Aden shotuld not remain linked with India under the new constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the new federation; that it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it should be decided that the adminis tration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following conditions would he estab lished : — (1) India would be relieved of the annual contriblution of approxi mately £150,000 sterling, or Rs. 20 lakhs, at present payable towards the military and political administration. (2) I he right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained. (3) His Majesty’s Government would maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. From their own point of view the abandonment of this policy would clearly in existing economic con ditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. (4) His Majesty’s Government womld do their utmost to maintain the present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place.

A prolonged discussion as to the financial and administrative responsibility followed the war, and was finally settled by a Cabinet decision of December 1926 on a basis financially far more favourable to India than previous proposals made by the Colonial Office, the civil (i.e., internal municipal) administration of the/the Settlement was left with India, and the political control (i.a., sole responsibility for the Protectorate) and military control with Hie Majesty’s Government, who took over the military and political charges with the aid of an annual contribution from Indian revenues (of £250,000 a year for the first three year®, and after that one third of the total annual cost, subject to a maxiiam of £150,000 &amp; year), India's present liability under this head is about £120,000, but re Sir Georgs Sehueter pointed out in the Assembly, it might at any time rise to £160,000, Pledges have been given by the Goverment of India from time to time that the civil administration rill not be transferred to His Majesty s Government Tfithout the Legislature end the interests concerned being riven an opportunity of expressing their views.

On 30th kay I received a deputation led by His Higiness the Agp. Khan, of which Sir P. Sethna was spokesman. I noted the views of the deputation end gave them the assurance that no decision would be taken before discussion, in the Indian Legislature, and furthermore tint, whatever the decision might he, every care would he taken to safeguard existing interests so far as it'jlay in the power of His Majesty's Government to do so. At the same time I suggested to the deputation, as matter for reflection, the difficulties of fitting Aden into the proposed Indian Federation. (iii) Subsequently, in order that the question mi^it be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests concerned with a full knowledge of the facts, His Majesty's Government authorised the statement published on 19th June (appended to tins memorandum and issued in India as the ««■*«&gt; of 20th June which is appended to Sir P. Sethna’s memorand^. stating the considerationswhich suggest the desirability of the transfer of Aden and the conditions and assurances which His Majesty's Goverment are prepared to give if transfer takes place. Since then opportunity has been given, as promised, for full discussion in both Chambers of the Indian Legislature, and steps have been taken to elicit the wishes of the Arab population of Aden itself. (iv)/(l\d Thus wa now have available all the material required for a full consideration of the question. For ;n y own part I have carefully studied the debates in the Legislature and need hardly say that 1 attach great weight to the views expressed therein, but 1 have also had to consider most anxiously the whole question in the licht of all the facts, the various and extensive interests involved, and the views expressed in various quarters. 5. The debates in the Indian Legislature indicate that the true nature of the difficulties of fitting Men into the proposed Indian Federation may not have been fully appreciated. The only difficulty mentioned in the debates was the fact that Aden io now a Chief cotrmissionar’s province directly under the Government of India, end members naturally asked why this difficulty could not be met by returning Men to the Government of Bombay and snaking it again part of the Bonbey Presidency. It is therefore desirable that 1 jSio'.sld explain more fully the underlying reasons for the assertions in my statement of 19th Juno that Aden 'waul* not naturally fit into the new Federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control'. They are as follows# It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a clean separation between the Arab town of Men and its Arab hinterland, the Aden Protectorate. Similarly, it would be impracticable to effect a complete divorce between the Civil administration of the Settl e sent n thems hand and 1 *ha political and Hdlltaxy control oi tat Pi-otectorsta on ths ©they. For many purposes tiie whole erati forme a single whole.

Tiis by itself* might be viewed as a decisive objection to the retention of ti e existing condominium when once the new constitution is established in India. Aden, in fact, besides its importance to the Qnpire as a refuelling station, is of greater general strategic importance to Imperial communications and to the Empire as a whole than to India by itself j moreover, Aden (Settlement plus Protectorate, which for this purpose are an integral whole) is of political importance with regard to Arabia. 7&gt; one of the most important factors to be considered is the interests of the Arab majority of the Aden population. In the Indian Legislature reference was made to resolutions against transfer purporting to represent the views ox the Arabs as well as of the Indians. But since the publication of my statement of 19th June, the object of which was to elicit Arab as well as Indian opinion, I have been at pains to obtain from the Chief Comissioner a report on the real wishes of the Arabs. The Chief Commissioner reports that the Arab community are as a whole satisfied with the existing state of affairs (i.e. with an administration controlled through the Government of India by H.M.G.), but that they view with grave misgivings the possibility that the Government of Aden may become Indianised as the result of constitutional changes in India, and fear the subordination of Arab to Indian interests; and (since a continuance of the present state of affairs would in any case be mad. impossible by the forthcoming Indian Reforms) they would on the whole prefer that the administration of Aden should henceforth be controlled by His Uajestys Government direct. 8 ./a* One of tlie fear a expressed in the taiiaa legislature was that under Crown Colony UoTernment Indiana would suffer from raeial dlaortelnatioa# I hi a is really answered fey 'feae oat ogor leal assumnoe whioii I gsre on 19th June that f aa one of the conditions of transfer, 'Ho racial legislation or segrogatlos would *e pomitted 'by ills Majesty *s Qav wme nt ”* There is no parallel at all betweeu t _ e situation in Aden and that i&amp; Kenya which hae been referred to in the debates in the Indian Iicgialeture • 9 , In the Connell of State debate Sir 5?. Sethna ausgaeted that, if the civil admini tration of Aden is transferred, India would lose Pn.lO lahha revenue from salt, ineome tax and super tan, to sot off against the saving on the military contribution. This point was dealt with b; Sir 0. Schuster in the Legislative Assembly. India would save the military contribution which in 1930-31 wao £150»00© (20 lakhs) in 1931-32 £134,000 and in 1532-33 about £ 120,000 (according to the preliminary figures), and might in eny year rise again bo the maximum of £150,000. On the other hand, as regarda the civil administration, oho would hand over an approximately even balance. The actual figures of civil revenue and expenditure for the years from 1927-28 to 1J33-34 are an follows»- Yeara/Yeara Sgrjaae.

The only qualification of the statement that an approximately even balance would be handed over is that soma part of the income tax paid in India in respect of Aden may be loot under the provisions for relief from double income taxj tae Government of India are naturally unable to givo any exact estimate of thia figure, but say that they may have to lose a lahh or two.10 - 10. It has also been suggested that 1£ Aden Is transferred, Indian trade would be lost and Indian merchants would leave and that this has been the result of the transfer of sonaliland to the Colonial Office in 1905. (Prior to that date Somaliland was administered by the Resident at Aden from 1884 to 1898, and by the foreign Office from 1898 to 1905). It is stated that traders (Indians, Jews and Arabs) have left the Somaliland ports owing to high taxation resulting from costly administration. However this may be, there is, as a matter of fact, no basis for the comparison between Aden and Somaliland. I understand that a reason why the Somaliland ports have decreased in prosperity is the difficulty in that country of levying direct taxation, owing to the unruly character of the inhabitants, with the consequence that the ^ministration is Hie more dependent on import duties. Bui the position at Aden is exactly the reverse, as Aden is a free port and the cost of the administration is met by direct taxation. li. Indian salt firms at Aden fear that their interests would be adversely affected by transfer. The position Is that salt uade in Men is at present exempt from the additional import duty in Inala Imposed by the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Mt of 1931, as amended in 1933, and accordingly Mares with salt made In India the advantage of a preference over other •foreign' salt. Under the operation of the Act of 1931 tills preference was 4, annas per nauna, but by the Act of 1933 it has been reduced to 2^ annas per maund. If Men ceased to be part of India and no concession were made to Aden salt, it would lose this preference. This is not a matter in Mich the secretary of State can interfere, as/ i r ij| , M Mr I- 11 - as he is precluded from doing so by the Fiscal Convention. If Aaen is separated, it will he for the Indian Legislature ^ of the future to decide what terms should he accorded to salt from Aden. The concern shown in the recent dehates in the Indian Legislature for the commercial and other interests of Indians at Aden seems to give some ground for hoping that, as I sincerely trust may he the case, the Legislature would not he unresponsive to any appeal on hehalf of the Aden salt manufacturers. Lmaer . 12 . The conditions contemplated hy His Majesty's ^plrlLs Government in the statement of 19th June In the event of t transfer are in my view generous and ought to meet any reasonable apprehensions on the part of the Indian interests conceraecU The speeches in the iae^iolature shewed that there are certain misunderstandings as to the meaning of these conditions# Those regarding the contribution and the promise that there would be no racial discrimination have been dealt with above. Assurance No.2* that a right of appeal would continue to lie to the Bombay High Gourt^has been included among the assurances in the Interests of Aden litigants* An undue amount of attention has, I think, been directed to the qualified form of assurances 3 (maintenance of the free poit) and 4 (maintenance of the present standard of administration without imposing additional taxation). As regards 3, I would emphasise, what is stated in the asairance, that from the point of view of His Majesty's Government themselves the abandonment of the policy oi a free port would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsouna, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. The assurance that the policy would be maintained was only qualified by the words 'unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place'. I think that critics of this/idltlonal isuraace . - la this qualification may have overlooked the word 'radical*. Assurance No.4 'not to impose any additional taxation* \ was qualified by the words 'unless such a course became, in His I^Jesty f s Government's opinion, absolutely necessary.' This is an obviously necessary qualification, as His Majesty's Government could not bind themselves in such a matter for ever. The wording of assurance No.5 'A proportion of Indian s ervice administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place' has been misunderstood. The meaning was that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would continue to belong to the Indian Service for some years. In the Indian Legislature it has been j interpreted to mean that only a proportion ox the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel j would be retained for some years, and that the remainder . would be sent away. In order to make more explicit the meaning of this assurance, I may say that His Majesty's Government are prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were thenffirvlng, subject only to modification by mutual consent; when vacancies occurred, Indians would reiaxin eligible for appointment (though there would be a gradual substitution of Colonial service officers); it would be understood that all newcomers to the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms to be agreed upon in each case, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service, unless these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. 13. His Majesty's Government are also prepared to give a specific additional assurance that in the event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conditions asany other British subjects 16th November, 1933*Confidential Memorandum (‘Z ) No .A.82 16.xi,33. JOINT C0M1TTEN ON INDIAIn[ CONST ITliT IONAL HSFOM . ADEN. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India . 1. I v. 1 jjsfa to make it clear at the outset that the note which follows expresses views about the future of Aden which I have to lay before my colleagues of the Joint Committee at this stage for their consideration. The nature of the recommendations to be made to Parliament is a matter for the decision of the Joint Committee, and that decision cannot, of course, be compromised in any way by tMs-dee^ftent. ^ 2. Aden has been an important entrepot of trade since early times - at any rate since the early centuries of Islam. In 1513 it was attacked unsuccessfully by Albuquerque. In 1#38 it was acquired by the Turks as a base of operations against the Portuguese, and belonged to them until 16^0. Subsequently it was possessed by various Arab Chiefs until 1839, when it was captured by the British with a force of 300 European and 400 Indian troops. The occasion of its capture was an outrage on the passengers and crew oi a British buggalow wrecked in the neighbourhood. The East India Company, however, had already in 18^9 contemplated making it a coaling station, but at that time had abandoned the idea, owing to the difficulty of procuring labour. Perim, which now forms part of the Aden Settlement, had been occupied by the British'in 1799 as a precaution against the possible descent of Hapoleon on India, but was subsequently abandoned till 1857, when it was reoccupied. It will thus be seen (a) that Aden has always bej&gt;ii place of general strategic ^.mportance, and (b)_ that hictorioolly^ as w&amp;ll -as^sog-raphicaily it' Is-air Arab town.. The- ouggcot«B» wh-ieh--havs''b'ee‘n’ma2e that Aden is the creation of Mian commercial enterprise/y ij p ^palatiQH i Recent histxjXY. ol, M^iQXLsa. trmg£gx&gt; S V-ut^ ds y— A enterprise have accordingly to be heavily discounted. The population of the Aden Settlement (excluding Perim, which has a population of 1,700) at the 1931 census was as follows: t4 # ' Arabs 29,820 Indians 7,287 Jews 4,120 Somalis 3,935 Europeans 1,145 Miscellaneous 331 Total 46,638 Thus about 64 per cent of the population is Arab as against about 15 per cent Indian* The total area of the Settlement is 75 square miles and of Perim 5 square miles. ^ Speeches delivered in the debates in the Indian Council of State on 31st August and in the Legislative Assembly on 16th and 18th September, 1933, referred to the history of the various recent steps : ;v * taken in regard to Aden. Tta- tendencr^ *®’ 8 ® of these spe eches fuU* th&gt; impression that H.M.G. led up to the present proposal by a series of faita acfiamBlia* In order fco correct any such impressions, it may be desirable to summarise the recent history of the question and the present position. (i) The political and military administration of Aden has been controlled by H.M.G. since 1917. when Vt was taken over as a war measure. A prolonged cOTrtrweray as to the financial and administrative responsibility followed the war, and was finally settled by a Cabinet decision of December 1926 on a basis financially far more favourable to India than previous proposals made by the Colonial Office; the/consideration of the present proposals for Indian constitutional reform, no question arose of revising the decision of 1926 regarding Aden. But as the proposals for an -aimestr autonos^us Indi m Federation^took clearer snape, it became obvious that the question of Aden would have again to be considered with a view to deciding whether the continuance of the existing arrangements would be practicable when-the Government of India rs converte&lt; into a Federal Government# Hence the statement m the White Paper that the future arrangements for the Aden bettlement are under consideration. On / 30th May tho SecittbcU &lt; y , 'n‘f' CbaW received a // deputation led by^'tre Aga^Khan, of which Sir F. Sethna was siookesman. Me* noted the views of the deputation and ^ve them the assurance that no decision would be taken before discussion in the Indian Legislature, and furthermore that, whatever the decision might be, every care would be taken to safeguard existing interests so far as it lay in j the power of H.L.G. to do so. At the same time he- suggested to the deputation, as matter for reflection, the difficulties of fitting Aden into an Indian Federation. (iii) Subsequently, in order that the question might be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests concerned with a full knowledge of the facts, H.M.G. authorised the statement published on 19th June (appended to this memorandum^, stating the considerations which suggest the desirability of the transfer of Aden and the jhh'j ggicreu^conditions and assurances which H.MTSTare prepared to give if transfer takes place.

For many purposes the whole area forms a single whole. At present there is a condominium, the civil administration of the Settlement being controlled from Delhi, the political control of the Protectorate and the defence of both being placed directly under H.E.G. Naturally there are very great practical difficulties involved in a condominium of this character. The only reason why it works efficiently in practice at all is that in the last resort, the decision of all questions arising vests in H.M.G* This is so because the Government of India under its present constitution is in the last resort subordinate to H.U.G. ^t^whe^x Government of India becomes 1 rnuiWit (iMjtilli rntwintir-irl responsibility for m the ci^yil ^ ^ of Chief Comt , '.issioners 1 Provinces^ the position vill be entirely different and the division of control, which is just workable at present, would become entirely unworkable. /&gt; - Furthermore, for defence purposes it is obviously impossible to make a distinction between the Protectorate and the Settlement, and it is therefore essential that the defence of thelatter as well as of the former should continue to be a direct responsibility of H.l .G. But a continuance of the present system, whereby defence vests in H.fe.CJ. in respect of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate, would become constitutionally anomalous if the Settlement became part of a semi-autonomous Indian Federation.

Aden, in fact, besides its importance to the J&amp;ipire as a refuelling station, is of greater general strategic importance to Imperial communications and to the Empire as a whole than to India by itself j moreover, Aden (Bettlament plus Protectorate, which for this purpose are an integral whole) is of political importance with regard to Arabia. MLinLeXfiSM- 7- of the most import^factor^to^ considered is the interests of the Arab majority* In the*Legislatare reference was made to resolutions against transfer purporting to represent the views of the Arabs as well as of the Indians. But since the 19th June ' the ° bjeCt ° f which was to elicit Arab as well as Indian opinion. I have been at pain s to obtain from the Chief Conwissioner a reprt on the real wishes of the Arabs. The Chief Conner reports that the o coimunity are as a whole satisfied with the existing state of affairs (i-e.. with an a«nis ratio controlled thro^ the Govenvnont of India y H.. but that they view with grave e , lit tha * the Government of aden • y possibility tha„ tndianised/of racial discrmjLna Uaa Iiidianieed as the result of constitutional changes in India, and fear the subordination of /&gt;xab ~o Indian interests; and (since a continuance of the present state of affairs would in any case be made impossible by the forthcoming Indian Reforms) they *»uld on the whole prefer that the administration of Aden should henceforth be controlled by H.M.G. direct, moreover, it would hardly be in accord with the principle of ( self -determination that Aden should be brought under an Indian Federal Government and Legislature; the Arab community could not be effectively represented in the Indian Legislature at Delhi and, especially in the absence of such effective representation, it would be too much to expect that when conflicts arose between arab and Indian interests the former would ^ J.u y . n rrivc the der-itian-^hiiih-ldiny--d&lt;- erveg) ^ yf One of the fears expressed in the Indian Legislature was that under Crown Colony Government Indians would suffer from racial discrimination.

Sethna suggested that, if the civil administration of Aden is transferred, India viould lose as.10 lakhs revenue from salt, income tax. and super tax, to set off against the saving, on the military contribution. This point was dealt with by Sir G. Schuster in the Legislative Assembly. India would save the military contribution which in 193G-31 was £150,000 (20 lakhs), in 1921-32 £136,000 and in 1932-33 about 120,000 (according to the preliminary figures), ana rught in any ysar rise again to the TnaxiiriUir of £150,000. On the other hand, as regards the civil administration, she would hand ever an approximately even balance. The actual figures of civil revenue and expenditure for the years 1.927-28 to 1933-54 are as follows:- Vani 1927- 28 1928- 29 1929- 30 192U-31 1931- 32 , , 1932- 33 (revised; Lakhs 7.46 10.86 12.18 10.28 12.04 13.64- 13.69 12.23 11.16 12.46 11.39 11.02 11.36 “ 6.231akhe - 1.37 + 1.02 - 2.18 i 0.6a + 2.62 + 0.86 1933-34 (budget ; 12.22 For these seven years the average balance is a deficit of Rs.0.66 lakhs, or. if the year 1927-28, which was abnormal, be excluded, a surplus of Hs.0.27 lakhs. For the year 1932-33 there was a comparatively large surplus of Hs.2.62 lakhs, due to the rise in income tax receipts m Aden in that yea,-. There wasa Briall and precar loan surplus in 1931^32 of R?i.0*65 lakhs and in 1933-34 (budget estimate) of Rs*0.86 lakhs due to retrenchments. The only qualification of the statement that an approximately even balance would be handed over in that some part of the income tax raid in India in respect of Aden may be lost under the provisions for relief from double income tax; the Government of India are naturally unable to give any exact estimate of this figure, bat say that they may have to lose a lakh or two. Affect of transfer odxiSSL* y ^ It has also been suggested that if Aden is transferred, Indian trade would be lost and Indian merchants roald lea^e’.— It has bowt tnat this ^.■vbeen the result of the transfer of Some-liland to the Colonial Office in 1905. (Prior to that date Somaliland was acteinietered by the Heeident at Aden from ISM to 1896, and by the Foreign Office from 1898 to 1905.) fhe-^ttet^Oiris that traders (Indians. Jew 0 sad .ixabe) have left the iataliland ports owing to high taxation resulting from costly administration. However this may be. there is. as a matter of fact, no basis for the comparison between A don and Somaliland. 1 -e*r understand that a rsaron why the Somaliland ports have decreased m prosperity mv-*e the difficulty in that country of levying direct taxation, owing to the unruly character of the inhabitants, with the consequence that the administration is the more dependent on import duties. But the position at Aden is exactly the reverse, as Men is a free port and the cost of the administration is met by direct taxation. II, Indian salt firms at Men fear that their interests would be adversely affected by transfer. The position is that salt trade in Men is at present exempt/exempt the additional import duty in India imposed by the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act of 1931* mnenrled in 1933, and accordingly shares with salt made in India the advantage of a preference over other 'foreign* salt. Under the operation of the Act of 1931 this preference was 4i annas per maond, but A*A. by the Act of 1933 it has been reduced to 21 annas &amp;■ ri'umd. If Aden ceased to be part of India and no concession were r-ade to Aden Bait* it would lose this preference* This is not a ri&amp;tter in which the Secretary of State can interfere, as he is precluded from do inf 3 * so by the 1 iscai bonv exit ion • Tiiciir # G-coemaant flf India Ims atFtted that, Aden is separated, -it will Us for the Indian Legislature of trie future to decide what terms should be accorded to salt from Aden. , icitude H’ ^— l&gt; r ' ^hown in the recent debater in the Indian ■V* I Legislature for the commercial «al other ; ^ of IV, V} Ih.

An exaggerated amount of attention has ato) been directed to the qualified form of /K\ assurances 3 (mintenance of the free port) and 4 (maintenance of the present standard of administration without imposing additional taxation)* As regards 3, I would emphasise, what is stated in the assurance, that from the point of view of H*tt*G* themselves the abandonment of the policy of a free port would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. The assurance that the policy would be maintained was only qualified by the words 'unless some radical change in the present economic situation should taice place • I think that critics of this qualification|have overlooked the word 'radical'. Assurance Mo. 4 'not to impose any additional taxation' was qualiiie^. by the woras 'unless such a course became, in H.M.G.*s opinion, absolutely necessary’ 1 • ihis is an obviously necessary qualification^ as JhhuG* could not bind themselves in such a matter The wording of assurance Mo. 5 proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place' has been misunderstood. The meaning waS|, x: ^^- - eo r uroo^j that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would continue to belong to the Indian Service for some years. In the u Legislature debates it has been interpreted to mean that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained/'1 retained for some years, and that the. remainder would be ^eent away 0 . In order to make more explicit the meaning of this assurance, I may say that H.L.G. are prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Men, all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terns of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent; when vacancies occurred, Indians would remain eligible for appointment (though there would be a gradual substitution of Colonial service officers); it would be understood that all newcomers to the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms to be agreed upon in each case, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service, unless these were specially imported into their ^agreements or letters of appointment. B H.M.G. are also prepared to give a specific additional assurance that in the event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any other British subject3. 16th November, 1^33*question ITo. 3 dated 13t h iTovemloer, 1953.

( 2 )(2). We can give an assurance that Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Aden Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any ot he r Bri t i sh subject^. Yours sincerely.may have been influenced by some desire to save their own face (if they had advocated transfer, the possible agitation following a resolution by the Legislature against io ou.lu have been directed against the G. of I. as well as against H.F.G.; now H.M.G. will be the main target); most probably, however, the G. of I. had felt unable to make uj their own minds on the question of transfer until they had obtained an expression of the views of the Legislature. (I understood from Mr. Metcalfe last April that opinion was divided in the Viceroy’s Council, though most of the members at that time realised the necessity of transfer; this majority seems now to have been turned into a minority by considerations arising from the result of the debates in the Legislature.) Whatever the cause of the G. of I.’s abstention, the result is unfortunate. The Legislature was left without guidance, as the strong case for transfer was not J °veloped by any of the G. of I.’s spokesmen; indeed, the G. of I. did not do as much as they might have done to correct the many misstatements and misleading statements made in the Legislature, though after the Council of State debate we sent a telegram on 6th Sept., suggesting that such statements should be corrected in the Assembly; certain misstatements, however (i.e., a misquotation of a remark by Sir D. Bray in January 1929), and Sir P. Sethri financial argument were corrected, and Sir J. Shore gave a, fair account of Arab feeling at Aden. The fact that the Legislature received no guidance from the G. of I. or any elaboration of the case for transfer summarised in the communinue of 19th June entitles us to discount somewhat the weight of c s X opinion expressed by the Legislature.

'W .j r X AUJ V luj, ^rj 1712b 5000 3/33 might have been passed, hut the same unanimous support for them might have been lacking. A perusal of the Legislature debates cannot fail to impress one with the strength of feeling expressed. Only one (nominated) member in each House x spoke in favour of transfer; the leader of the European (jb 1 h v t**/ ^ groupTTr^thr^Assembly) spoke against it; one member in the Assembly, hr. Jehangir K. Funshi, spoke very bitterly to an ironical motion that the Assembly recommends ’’that Indian interests, as well as indigenous Arab interests, should be sacrificed, and that the civil administration of Aden should be transferred to the Colonial Office, with a view to safeguarding and promoting Imperial interests*’. One unfortunate result of the debates is that, - while the question of Aden previously appealed mainly to the Bombay Pars is, who havej material interests there, the strong protests now madefy ; the Legislature are quite likely to create a much more extensive factitious puolic opinion. The G. of I.’s telegram of 12th Oct., which for the first time states their considered views on the question of the transfer of the civil administration, does not meet the real arguments against maintaining dual control after India becomes a semi-autonomous Federation- The objections to a continuance ci divided authori y I think, those suggested in para. 5 ' lie brit ' f There is also the objection (not stated in the brief, as it would hardly be a suitable argument to use to the Indian delegates) that, if the,dual control is not abolished now, it will be very much more difficult to . abolish it at a later date, when once the Settlement■ Pa has become incorporated m the Federation; the G. of I. recognise that transfer of the civil administration may be necessary at some future date, but they ignore the fact that, the future will be a much more difficult time than the present for effecting it. The G. of I. ! s telegram hardly deals with the merits of transfer at all, end perhaps they themselves have hardly appr.ci.tad the faU f.rea .fjhe tar^tf l+&gt; n They do, however, suggest a danger which no cioubu require consideration, yiz., that transfer now, in the face of the protests of the Legislature, may engender widespread resentment and be 'a most unfortunate precursor to the introduction of the new r constitution in Ino-ia. uxie telegram also suggests a point of view which was put forward more expressly by some speakers in the debates - XiiL• &gt; t^at if India is allowed to retain an interest in Aden, it gives her, as it were, a concrete stake in the Imperial connection There is also another point which deserves some consideration. It is extremely unlikely (though just nossible) that the Indian Legislature will agree to the cVu'v continuance of any preferential treatment of Aden sa it/i*r- India'; it is possible that the loss of the preference J — r?X* — X 4-/-s \ r\ r&gt;\r\ have ahWKOfiiMB effect on the Aden sit industry, whose natural market is presumably in India; the question oi compensating the local industry from Imperial funds might even arise; if the local industry suffer^seriously, this may have an appreciable effect on Aden's revenue from salt Ire 1 * . royalties and income tax as the firms engaged m the industry. If this happened, it might be difficult for H.M.G. to avoid imposing additional taxation, (which they have said they would not do, unless it becomes m their opinion/Department. j opinion absolutely necessary). ! These considerations, however, are outweighed by ' the advantages of taking the present opportunity to effect the transfer, and H.M.G. will no doubt decide to take this step, in accordance with the preliminary ^ conclusions reached by the Cabinet last Feby. i It would seem very desirable, ho?/ever, that ! before the decision of H.M.G. is announced, an opportunity i should be found’of properly presenting the case for transfer, as it has not hitherto been adequately presented to the Indian public.

C 2 Brief for Secretary of State. 1. Aden has Been an important entrepot of trade since earx^ billies — at any rate since the early centuries of Islam. In 1513 it was attacked unsuccessfully By AlBuquerque. In 1538 it was acquired By the Turks as a Base of operations against the Portuguese, and Belonged to them until 1630, when it passed Back to the possession of the Imam of the Yemen. Subsequently it was possessed By various Arab Chiefs until 1339, when it was captured By the British with a force of 300 European and 400 Indian troops. The occasion of its capture was an outrage on the passengers and crew of a British Buggalow wrecked in the neighbourhood. The East India Company, however, had already in 1829 contemplated making it a coaling station, But at that time had abandoned the idea, owing to the difficulty of procuring labour. Perim, which now forms part of the Aden Settlement, had Been occupied By the British in 1799 as a precaution against the possible descent of Napoleon on India, was subsequently abandoned till 1857 when it was re-oc cupied. It will thus Be seen (a) tnat Aden has always Been a place of general strategic importance, and (B) that historically as well as geographically it is an Arab town. The assertion made in the Indian Legislature that Aden is the creation of Indian commercial enterprise has to Be heavily discounted. 2. The population of the Aden Settlement (excluding Perim, which has a population of 1,700) at/' at the 1931 census was as follows; Arabs 29,820 Indians 7,287 Jews 4,120 Somali s 3,935 Europeans 1,145 Miscellaneous 331 Total 46, 638 Thus about 54 per cent of the population is Arab as against about 15 per cent Indian. The total area of the settlement is 75 square miles and of Perim 5 square miles. Recent history 3. Many speakers in the Legislature went of question of transfer. through the history of the various recent steps taken in regard to Aden, and sought to give the impression that H.M.G. had intentionally led up to the present proposal by a series of faits accoinpli_s_ . In order, therefore, to correct false impressions, it might be desirable for the Secretary of State when he speaks to the Indian Delegates and the Joint Select Committee, to give a short resume of the recent history of the question leading up to the present position somewhat as follows. - (i) The political and military administration has been controlled by His Majesty’s Government since 1917, when it was taken over as a war measure. A prolonged controversy as to the financial and administrative responsibility for Aden followed the war and was finally settled by the Cabinet decision ofDecember 1926 on a basis financially far more favourable to India than previous proposals made the Colon!8,1 Officej the civil (i.e. internal municipal) administration of the Settlement was left with India, and the political control (i.e. sole responsibility for the Protectorate) and military control with H.M.G., who took over the military and political charges with the aid of an annual contribution from Indian revenues (of £250,000 a year for the first three years, and after that one-third of the total annual cost, subject to a maximum of £150,000 a year). India’s present liability under this head is about £ 120 , 000 , but as Sir George Schuster pointed out in the Assembly, it might at any time rise to £150,000. Pledges have been given by the Government of India from time to time that the civil administration will not be transferred to His Majesty’s Government without the Legislature and the interests concerned being given an opportunity of expressing their views. In 1931 it was decided, as a measure of administrative convenience, to transfer the administration from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India, and this transfer was made with effect/effect from 1st April 1952. In November Lord Hillingdon and Sir E.Howell stated to a deputation that this change did not aifect the question of transfer to the Colonial Office and was not a step towards any other change. That statement was truej there was no arri^re pensde in the decision taken in 1931: it was taken simply as a matter of administrative convenience; if it had not been taken, the constitutional question which has now arisen would have had to be considered none the less. (ii) Until progress had been made with consideration of the present proposals for Indian constitutional reform, no question arose of revising the decision of 1926 regarding Aden. But as the proposals for an almost autonomous Indian Federation took clearer shape, it became obvious that the question of Aden would have again to be considered with a view to deciding whether tne continuance of the existing arrangements would be practicable when the Government of India is converted into an autonomous Federal Government. Hence the statement in the White Paper that the future arrangements for the Aden Settlement are under consideration. On 30th May the Secretary of State received a deputation led by the Aga Khan, of which Sir P. Sethna was spokesman. He noted the views of deputation and gave them the assurance that no decision would be taken before5. discussion in the Indian Legislature, and furthermore that, whatever the decision oe, every care would be taken to safeguard existing interests so far as it lay in the power of His Majesty’s u oveminent to do so. At the sanie time he suggested to the deputation, as matter or reflection, the difficulties of fitting Aden into an Indian Federation. It would be as well to recall this, because Sir P. Sethna in the Council of State and speakers in the Legislative Assembly misinterpreted the Secretary of State’s strictly non-committal attitude as one of sympathy with the deputation, and attributed to him a statement that the difficulty of fitting Aden into the Federation was not insurmountable J 7 (iii) Subsequently, in order that the question might be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests concerned with a full knowledge of the facts, His Majesty’s Government authorised the communique of 19th June, stating the considerations which suggest the desirability of the transfer of Aden and the very generous conditions and - assurances which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give if transfer uaxes place. Since then opportunity has been given, as promised, for full discussion in both Chambers of the Indian Legislature, s and steps have been taken to elicit tne wishes of the Arab population of Aden tj itself. (iv)/6. Imperial interests difficulty of niacin? civil idministrati on fflder Indian federal Gnvt. 4. (i^) Thus the matter is now nearly ripe for a decision. The Secretary of State has carefully studied the debates in the Legislature and has given due weight to the views expressed therein, but he has also had to consider most anxiously the whole question in the light of all the facts, the various and extensive interests involved, and the views expressed in various quarters. The following points might be mentioned. The strategic position of Aden and its importance from this point of view to the Empire in the East generally and not merely to any single unit, is a strong argument for control by the Home Government. This by itself might well be considered by Parliament here as a decisive objection to the retention of the existing condominium when once the new constitution is established in India. Aden, besides its importance to the Empire as a refuelling station, is in fact of greater general strategic importance to Imperial communications and to the Empire as a whole than to India by itself; moreover, Aden (Settlement plus Protectorate, 'which for this purpose are an integral whole) is of political importance w r ith regard to Arabia. 5. The debates in the Legislature indicate that (owing perhaps partly to the omission of the Government of India to give any guidance) members failed to realise the true nature of the difficulties of fitting Aden into an Indian Federation. The only difficulty mentioned in the debates was the fact that Aden is now a Chief Commissioner's province directly . under the G.of I., and members naturally asked this difficulty could not be met by returning Aden to the Govt, of Bombay and making it again part of ■4- In /the Bombay Presidency. They even insinuated that Aden had been taken away from Bombay for the purpose of creating this very difficulty. The Secretary of State will therefore, no doubt, wish to explain more iully the reasons for the statements in the communiav ofp.9th June that Aden 'would not naturally fit into the new Federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control”. The real points which were missed in the Legislature appear to be as follows It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a clean separation between the Arab town of Aden and its Arab hinterland, the Aden Protectorate. Similarly, it would be impracticable to effect a complete divorce between the civil administration of the Settlement on the one hand and the political and military control ol the Settlement and the Protectorate on the other. For many purposes the whole area forms a single whole. At present there is a condominium, the civil administration of the Settlement being controlled from Delhi, the political control of the Protectorate and the defence of both being placed directly under His Majesty's Government. Naturally there are very great practical difficult! involved in a condominium of this character The only reason why it works efficiently in ^4-4 /practice at all is that in the last resort the decision of all questions arising vests in His Majesty’s Government. This is so because the Government of India under its present constitution is in the last resort subordinate to His Majesty’s Government*But when the Government of India becomes an autonomous Government, the position will be entirely different, and the division of control, which is just workable at present, would become entirely unworkable* Pur thermae for defence purposes it is obviously impossible to make a distinction between the Protectorate and the Settlement, and it is therefore essential that the defence of the latter as well as of the former should continue to be a direct responsibility of His Majesty’s Government* But a continuance of the present system, whereby defence vests in His Majesty’s Government in respect of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate, would hecome constitutionally anomalous if the Settlement became part of an autonomous Indian Federation. It is , felt that such a constitutional anomaly would he difficult to defend against criticism in the Indian Federal Legislature, and might lead to a not illogical demand for the retransfer or the military control to India# ■p might go onto point out 6* The Secretary of State mig 8 , &gt;ne of the most important factors ^ iterests 01 e 3 0 iutions y ‘gainst transfer jnce was made to res purporting/say that purporting to represent the views of the Arabs as well as of the Indians. The Secretary of state might since the issue of Jhe communique of 19th June, the object of which was to elicit Arab as well as Indian opinion, he has been at pains to obtain from the Chief Commissioner a report on the real wishes of the Arabs. The Chief Commissioner reports that the Arab community view with grave misgivings the possibility that the Government of Aden my become Indianised as the result of constitutional changes in India, and fear the subordination of Arab to Indian interests: the Arabs are as a whole satisfied with the existing state of affairs (i.e., with an administration controlled through the Government of India by His Majesty*s Government); but, since a continuance of the present state of affairs will in any case be made impossible by the forthcoming Indian Reforms, they would prefer that the administration of Aden should henceforth he controlled hy His tejesty's Government direct. Moreover, It would hardly oe In accord with the principle of self-determination that Aden should he brought under an Indian Federal Lrovernment and Legislature; the Arab community could not be effect! y represented In the Indian Legislature at Delhi especially in the absence of such effective representation it would be too much to expect that when conflicts a between Arab and Indian interests the former would always receive the consideration which tney ues 1 Sir P. sethna and other speakers laid grea stress on their fear that under Crown colony Go verdant Indians would suffer from racial &amp;s one refused to believe the categorical assur n ^ of the conditions of transfer in the CoirmunjJune that 'No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by Some speakers admitted that this was well-meant, but said that the hands of the Colonial Office would be forced. They drew parallels from Kenya. The Secretary of State could point to Ceylon, Malaya, Mauritius and British Guiana as examples of colonies where Indian nancial 'feet or immigrants enjoy equal rights with the other inhabitants. The Indian fear on this subject as regards Aden is evidently based on an entire misconception. Even if Indians have a grievance in Kenya as regards their status compared with that of the European settlers, a similar position could not possibly arise at Aden, as there could never be any question of European settlement there. 8. In the Council of State debate Sir P.Sethna attempted to maie the point that, if the civil administration of Aden is transferred, India would lose Rs.10 lakhs revenue from salt, income tax and super tax, to set off against the saving on the military contribution. This point was completely disposed of by Sir G. Schuster in the Legislative Assembly. India would save the military contribution whi in 1930-31 was £150,000 (20 laAhs), in 1931-32 £136,000 and in 1932-33 about £120,000 (according to the preliminary figures), and mi^it in any year rise again to ohe maximum of £150,000. On the other hand, as regards the civil administration, she would hand over an approximately even balance. The actual figures of civil revenue and ^ expenditure for the years 1927-28 to 1933 34 are QiimlllS + lears.

There was a small and precarious surplus in 1931-32 of Rs.0.65 lakhs and in 1933-34 (budget estimate) of Rs.0.86 lakhs due to retrenchments. The only qualification of the statement that an approximately even balance would be handed over is that some part of the income tax paid in India in respect of Aden may be lost under the provisions for relief from double income tax; the Cxovernment of India say that it is quite impossible to give any reliable estimate of this figure, but that they may have to lose a lakh or two. 9. Sir P. Sethna stated in the Council of State that if Aden is transferred, Indian trade would be lost and Indian merchants would leave, and alleged that this had been the result of the transfer of Somaliland to the Colonial Office. /'Somaliland was administered by the Resident at Aden from 1884 to 1898; in that year it was transferred to the Foreign Office, and in 1905 to the Colonial Office.^/ Sir P. Sethna*s apprehensions appear to be based on two factors: (1) At his interview with It. Butler on 4th October, he referred us to Sir H.Dinshaw as his authority for these apprehensions. From a memorial to the Viceroy of which we have a copy it appears that Sir H. Dinshaw's fears are partly based on the anticipation that Aden's trade with India, yenerally, and the salt industry in particular, would suffer from the Indian import tariff. There may be som sub stance/substance in this anticipation as regards salt (see below). (2) There is, however, a different point involved in Sir P.Sethna's comparison with Somaliland. The allegation is that traders (Indians, Jews and Arabs alike) have left the Somaliland ports owing to high taxation resulting from costly administration. But as a matter of fact there is no basis for the comparison. It is understood from Colonel Reilly that the reason why the Somaliland ports have gone down is that the Somaliland Administration, owing to the unruly character of the inhabitants, is totally unable to levy any direct taxation, and consequently depends entirely on import duties; the position at Aden is exactly the reverse, as Aden is a free port and the cost of the administration is met by direct taxation. 10. Indian salt firms at Aden fear that their Aden interests would be adversely affected by transfer. The position is that salt made in Aden is at present exempt from the additional import duty in India imposed by the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act of J931, and accordingly shares with salt made in India the advantage of a preference over other ”foreign ,, salt of 2£ annas a maund. (The duty on foreign imported salt was reduced this year from 4£ annas to annas per maund). If Aden ceased to be part of India and no concession were made to Aden saxt, it would lose this preference. This is not a matter in which the Secretary of State could interfere as he is precluded by the Fiscal Convention. The Government/inor aovernment of India have stated (in a telegram of 31st August) that, if Aden is separated, it will be for the Indian Legislature of the future to decide what terms should be accorded to salt from Aden* The Government of India have also made it pretty clear (in a letter of 13th February) that they foresee little chance of favourable treatment of Aden salt by the Indian Legislature, and are quite definite in their view that there would be no case, failing such special treatment, for compensation or assistance of the Aden salt industry at the expense of Indian revenues. Apparently all that the Secretary of State could say on the subject of salt would be to recall that in the recent debates in the Legislature great solicitude was shown for the commercial and other interests of Indiansat Aden, and to hope that this may indicate some chance that the Indian Legislature may not be unresponsive to any appeal on behalf of the Indian salt manufacturers at Aden that may be made by Sir P. Sethna and his friends when the question arises. 11. Sir P. Sethna's speech and the other speeches in the Legislature showed that there were misconceptions (genuine or deliberate) regarding the generous conditions contemplated by His Majesty's Government in the onmmuniauS of 19th June in the event of transfer. Those regarding the contribution and the promise that there would be no racial discrimination have been dealt with above. As regards assurance No .2 that a right of appeal would continue to lie to the Bombay High Court, several speakers poured scorn on this, as if it were intended/intended as a sop to Bombay. In reality, of course, it was included among the assurances in the interests of Aden litigants. Most unfair play was also made in the debates with the qualified form of assurances 3 (maintenance of the free port) and 4 (maintenance of the present standard of administration without imposing additional taxation). As regards 3, the Secretary of State might emphasise, what is stated in the assurance, that from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government themselves the abandonment of the policy of a free port would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. The assurance that the policy would be maintained was only qualified by the words 'unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place'. The emphasis is on the word 'radical', which was ignored by speakers in the Legislature. The assurance No.4 'not to impose any additional taxation' was qualified by the words 'unless such a course became, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, absolutely necessary This is an obviously necessary qualification, as His Majesty’s Government could not bind themselves in such a matter pour tout jamahs . The wording of assurance No.5 'A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place was entirely misunderstood. The meaning was, of course, that a proportion of the administration personnel at Aden would continue to belong to the Indian/Indian Service for some years. In the Legislature debates it was twisted to mean that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained for some years, and that the remainder would be 'sent away'. The Colonial Office have now made more explicit the meaning of this assurance. They would be prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent; when vacancies occurred, Indians would remain eligible for appointment/ (though there would be a gradual substitution of Colonial service officers),* it would be understood that all newcomers to the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms to be agreed upon in each case, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service, unless these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. The Colonial Office now give a specific additional assurance that in the event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any other British subjects.DRAFT BRIEF FOR THE S. OF S. By maintaining an attitude of neutrality in the Legislature, the G-. of I. allowed the case for the transfer of the Civil Administration of Aden to go by default. As a result partly of this, the debates were very ill-informed even as to facts, and members showed a thorough lack of appreciation of the arguments in favour of transfer, and genuine or deliberate misunaerstanding of almost every ooint in the of 19th June. Except that Sir J. Bhore gave an accurate account of the present state of feeling of the large Arab majority at Aden, and that Sir G. Schuster dealt faithfully with Sir P. Sethna* s financial errors, the G. of I. did little even to correct incorrect and misleading statements. The debates showed a practically unanimous and often bitter strength of feeling against the transfer of the civil administration (only one nominated member in each Chamber spoke for it, and even the leader^ of the European group in the Assembly spoke against it). In speaking to the Indian delegates and the Joint Select Committee the S. of S. would have an opportunity both of putting the positive arguments for transfer, and of correcting the misapprehensions shown by the Legislature. The brief below states the salient facts as regards the history and population of Aden, trie arguments for transfer on the grounds of Imperial ana Arab interests, and the real nature of the difficulties anticipated from putting Aden under an Indian Federation; it also deal? with the fears,expressed VV. \y Hi HisklX- PQDulation . XT' y ^ by Sir P. Sethna and otherB^of discrimination against Indians under Crown Colony govt., and corrects various riinor misunderstandings. 1. Aden has been an important entrepot of tracie since eariy times - at any rate since the early centuries of Islam. In 1513 it was attacked unsuccessfully by Albuquerque. In 1538 it was acquired by the Turks as a base cf operations against the Portuguese, and belonged to them until 1630, when it passed back to the possession of the Imam of the Yemen. Subsequently it was possessed by various Arab Chiefs until 1839, when it was captured by the British with a force of 300 European and 400 Indian troops. The occasion of its capture was an outrage on the passengers and crew of a British buggalow wrecked in the neighbourhood. The East India Company, however, had already in 1829 contemplated making it a coaling station, but at that time had abandoned the idea, owing to the difficulty of procuring labour. Penm, which now forms part oi the Aden Settlement, had been occupied by the British in 1799 as a precaution against the possible aescexio Ox Napoleon on India, but was subsequently abanaoned till 1857, when it was V e ' occap1 / \ +v, 0 + bps It will thus be seen (a) that Aden na^ always been a place of general strategic importance, and (b) that historically as well as geographically it is an Arab town. The«^ -de in-4he- that Adenjis th^creation Ox Indian commercial enterprise has to be heavily discounted. 2. The population of the Aden Settlement (excluding Perim, which has a population oxat the 1931 census was as follows: n Arabs Indians Jews Somalis Europeans Miscellaneous Total 46,638 Thus about 64 per cent of the population is Arab D ecent history of question or t] 3. ttoougjh^the history of the various recent steps a y ^ taken m regard to Aden,, aad ooegnt/To give the'- /t ^ impression that H.M.G. had intentionally led up to /fw. t ^ , J ^ the present proposal by a series of f,ait,S V'/f 'pi c: 2(vV ^ In order^therefcre^ to correct talie impressions, it mighrt be desirable for tho Sr- of S» r -when he- A speaks to trhe --hndiraTr~ 0 Fi'egates - and- tlie^J^S^C^^iq-. jg^^iwwrTrr the recent history of the a~J question leading'up-to the present position somewhat ais-- foH-ows: - (i) The political and military administration^has been controlled by H.M.G. since 1917. when it was taken over as a war ' ' ^ measure. A prolonged controversy a. to the financial and administrative responsibility for Aden followed^tte war and was finally settled by -fete-' Cabinet decision of December 1926 on a basis financially far more favourable to India than previous proposals mp.de the^C.O.; ^ internal^ci|a]J. stratio ^ vas left with India/ against about 15 per cent Indian. The total area of 01 x 6 be^tlement^ is 7^ so. miles and of Perim 5 so. miles. I.' any- speaker s—i-n \took over the military and political charges with the aid of an annual f .oncribauion from Indian revenues •of £250,000 a year for the first three years, and after that one third oi '..ne total annual cost, subject to a maximum of £150,000 a year). India's present liability under this head is about £120,000, but as Sir George Schuster pointed out in the Assembly, it might at any time rise to £150,000. Pledges have been given by the G. of I. from time to time that the civil administration will not be transferred to H.M.G. without the Legislature and the interests concerned being given an opportunity Lord Willingdon and Sir E. Howell stated to a deputation that this change did not affect the question of transfer to the 0.0. and was net a step towards any other change. That statement was true; there was decision no a.rriere rmSSS. in the taken A in 1931: it was taken simply as a matter of administrative convenience; of expressing their views. In 1931 it was decided, as a measure of administrative convenience, to transfer the administration from the ^ transfer was made with effect rorr. 1st April, 1932. A- Govt, of Bombay to the G. ofif it had not been taken, the constitutional question which has now arisen would have had to be considered none the less. (ii) Until progress had been made with consideration of the present proposals for Indian constitutional reform, no question arose of revising the decision of 1926 regarding Aden. But as the proposals for an almost autonomous Indian Federation took clearer shape^ it became obvious that the question of Aden would have again to be considered with a view to deciding whether the continuance of the existing arrangements would be practicable when the G. of I. is converted into anl aA^Aomoub''Federal Govt. Hence the statement in the 'v^hite Paper that the future arrangements for the Aden Settlement are under consideration. Gn GGtL May the S. of S. received a deputation led by the Aga Khan, of which Sir P. Sethna was spokesman, nnt.fid the views of the deputation and gave them the assurance that no decision would be taken before discussion in the Indian Legislature, and furthermore that, whatever the decision might be every care would be taken to safeguard existing interests so faras it lay in the power of H.M.G. to :; ° 30 ‘ At the sa ‘ v “ e time he suggested '-u the deputation, as matter for reflection, the difficulties of fitting Aden into an Indian Federation. Z^trmrrrbT^Tel^ recall this, because Sir P. Setjfiha in txie Council of State and speakers in the Legislative Assembly/ misinterpreted the A of S.’s strictly non-committal attitude as one of sympathy with the deputation, Jr and attributed to him a statement / that tbe difficulty of fitting Aden into the Federation was not insurmo unt abl (iii) Subsequently, in order that the question might be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests concerned with a full knowledge of the facts, H.M.G. authorised the- 19th June, stating the considerations which suggest the desirability of the transfer of Aden and the very generous conditions and assurances which H.M.G. are prepared to give if transfer takes place. Since then opportunity has been given, as- promised, for full discussion in both Chambers of the Indian Legislature, and steps have been taken to elicit the wishes of the Arab population of Aden itself. (iv)/(iv) Thus the matter is now ne^rij- .ipe xor a decision. °' f htts carefully studied the debates xn the Legislature and &amp;e given due weight to the views expressed where in, but he-ha»- also had to consider most anxiously the whole question in the light ^ ot all the facts, the various and extensive interests involved, and the views expressed in various quarters. I y' The points hwhich ftr^_,jB 6 loct’c 0 . f 2 rom some suggested in a report of the C.I.D. in .192?,, but are perhaps sufficiently obvious to ( be stated in publi^ mght-tee mentionedL.^ Adefe r * f/ besides its importance to the Empire as a refuelling .^ ( ^ station, is of greater general strategic VW/ ^ A \ ! importance to Imperial communications and to the y &lt;kJr&gt;y ^ k yJ \ T L&gt; L it.if j Empire as a whole than, to India by itself; moreover, )f- ^ '-^'^jAden (Settlement -plus Protectorate, which for this k ^purpose are an integral whole) is of political *-&gt;''&gt;»£» l&gt; W*M*U f importance with regard to Arabia. The debates in the Legislature indicate that £^wing&lt;~pei4+&amp;pS''**p&amp;rtrly^ s wie Cr. 0 f'--d; -tn--giTe-anx^ ) members fail^d-4o~ realise) the true nature o f the difficulties oi fitting Aden into an Indian Federation, ihe only difficulty mentioned xn the debates was the fact that Aden is now a Chief Coranissioner's province directly under the G. of I., and members naturally asked why this difficulty could not be met by retumxng Aden to the Govt, of Bombay and making it agaxn part oi il Difficulty of .acing civil administra tion under Indian Federal Govt . the/T In, the Bombay Presidency. .They even insinuated that- Aden had. been taken away from Bombay for the purpose of creating this very difficulty. The S. 0 f S therefore, no...douop, wish to explain more fully the reasons for the ; statem^tV'in the gflnr.unioue of 19th June that Aden 'would not naturally fit into the new Fedenn.ion, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly oat of Indian control'. The^ ■ so* f * real points which were r.Esed in the Legislature appear to be as follows^ . It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a clean separation between the Arab town of Aden and its Arab hinterland, the Aden Protectorate. Similarly, it would be impracticable to effect a complete divorce between the civil administration of the Settlement on the one hand and the political and military control of the Settlement and the Protectorate on the other. For many purposes the whole area forms a single whole. At present there is a condominium, the civil administration of the Settlement being controlled from Delhi, the political control of the Protectorate and the defence of both being placed directly under H.M.G. Naturally there are very great practical difficulties involved in a condominium of this character. The only reason why it works efxiciently in practice/m the last resort subordinate to H.M.G. But when the Gh of I. becomes an ^ ^ f / autonomous Government^ the position will be entirely different and the division of control, which is just workable at present, would become entirely unworkable. Furthermore, for referee purposes it is obviously impossible to make a distinction between Lij.e Protectorate and the Settlement, and it is therefore essential that the defence of the latter as vrell as of the former should continue to be a direct responsibility of H.M.G. But a continuance of the present system, whereby defence vests in H.M.G. in respect of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate, would become constitutionally anomalous if the Settlement became part of a&amp; a autonomous Indian Federation. It is felt that such a constitutional anomaly would be difficult to defend against criticism in the Indian Federal Legislature, and might lead to a not illogical demand for the retransfer of the military control uc India. One of the most important factors to be consiuered is the interests of the Arab majority. In the Legislature reference was made to resolutions against transfer Arab intersgf.« . 6.

The-£^f.-s._a i ^^- thafc since the issue of the comonique of 19th June, the object of vfhich was to elicit Arab as well as Indian opinion, he-has been at pains to obtain from the Chief Commissioner a report on the real wishes of the Arabs. The Chief Commissioner reports that the — wf ^rab community/view with grave misgivings the possibility that the Govt, of Aden may become Indianised as the result of constitutional changes in India, and fear the subordination of Arab to Indian interests; t^e..-Arab#--ft're/as a whole J \ satisfied with the existing state of affairs (i.e.,\ with an administration controlled through the G. of I. by H.M.G.j/] -but^Mnce a continuance of the preset state of affairs would in any case be made impossible by the forthcoming Inaian Reformsj they would prefer that the administration of Aden should henceforth be controlled by H.h.G. direA. Moreover, it would hardly be in accord with the principle of self-determination that Aden should be brought under an Indian Federal Govt, and Legislature the Arab community could not be effective!) reoresented in the Indian ^egislatur^at Delhi and, .especially in the absence of such/representation, it would be too much to expect that when conflicts arose between Arab and Indian interests the forc.er would always receive the consideration which t y deserved. / ^^ 7 ^ other speakers -laic ; that under Crown Colony r^^ -strress f x from racia.1 Government Indians wu^suffe^ categorical «.ar»ce ** ‘'j 3fear of racial discrimination .

In the Council of State debate Sir P. £'*-JrtsyCA Sethna attempted: that, if the civil administration of Aden is transferred, India would lose Rs .10 lakhs revenue from salt, income tax and super tax, to set off against the saving on the military contribution. This point was completely disposed' o# by Sir G-. Schuster in the Legislative- Assembly. India would save the military contribution which in 1930-31 was £150,000 ( 20 lakhs), in 1931-32 £136,000 and in 1932-33 about £ 120,000 (according to the preliminary figures), and might in any year rise again to the maximum of £150,000.

The colonial status is what they fear, and I have no doubt that a satisfactory solution of the salt Question is what they really desire* I have always thought it a pity that Aden is under divided control and the argument in this telegram that H.M.G. can take over later seems to me to be a weak solution unless a definite date be put, which would be almost impossible.

We are much disappointed with the result of this debate and the subsequent debate which took place in the Legislative Assembly on 18th Sept, (the report of which will be sent to you in due course). We had hoped that the G. of I., with the announcement of 19th June as their brief, might be able to induce the Legislature at least to take a less onesided view of the question. But the G. of I. - c in the debate in the Council of State, at any rate - appear to have adopted a purely laodicean attitude. 1'he results of the debates, though they are not likely to affect the final decision, will make c matters a bit more difficult. Our S. of S. anticipates that the c * Indian delegates in the Joint Select Committee will raise the question some time during the autumn session of the Committee, and he-wSs anxious to prepare a good case to meet them. We are preparing a brief for him. There/ -J : I hThere are two points in the debate in the Council of State on which you will probably be able to assist us: (1) On page 103 you will see that Sethna entirely distorted the meaning of assurance ^&gt;) in the announcement of 19th June. The meaning of that assurance was, of course, that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would r continue to be- from the Indian Service for some years. Sethna appears to have misunderstood it as meaning that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained for some years, and that the remainder would be 'sent away'. You will remember that we had wind of a possible misapprehension of this sort, and discussed the matter with you some time ago. It may be desirable to make it clear that what is meant is that, while the higher political appointments (in which officers of the Indian Pol. Dept., but not Indians, are concerned) would be staffed from the Colonial Service on the expiry of the terns of the present incumbents, there i no intention that transfer should make an; difference to the conditions on which Indians are at present serving in other posts, and that the position of such Indians/IWJJ.C. Wa,, Draft Paper. Department. n Indians actually ho Id in g appointments at Aden will remain as at present. You will remember that the appointment of Muharonad Yasin Khan, the Registrar of the Resident’s Court, was a case in point. (2) On page 114 you will see that Sir Muhamnad Akbar Khan,(the only member of the Council of State who spoke in favour of the transfer) Indians as a-wfacrfe . . . should not be stopped from entering the Aden Protectorate/ as is the custom now. In order to make this point clear, could the S. of S., if he wishes, say freedom of movement to and from the 'HA**- Protectorate as o the ^inhabitants o the Settlements stated that he supported separation on the clear understanding that ^ that Indians have the same YourtI' 1 r. k/^liw. . £ X _ fc?)

The reports of the debates should be here next week, as the G. of I. are sending them by air mail ?. S K / / .S^ As regards Sir P. Sethna's financial points 1 v* l y 4 /i ^ yr i/ u ^ (5), the G. of I. are sending us with the reports a &lt; V letter giving details of the civil revenue and ^X ex P enc ^^ are * These details should throw light on Sir P. Aft Sethna f s statement regarding special expenditure on the (^’ civil hospital^. Sir Hormusjee Dinshaw will,, no doubt explain t 4 LSic~ ^ why loss of Indian trade, should be feared (point 6). We have a copy of a memorial from him to the Viceroy, but the only substantial reasons for such fears indicated m the memorial appear to be (a) that Aden’s trade with India would suffer generally, owing to the Indian tariff, and (b) that the salt industry at Aden, in particular,would suffer through losing the preference at present given in India to Aden salt over foreign salt. India is at present the chief market for Aden salt. industry is a substantial point, but unfortunately it is not one on which H.M.G. or the S. of S. can help, as any decision to make a concession to Aden salt would have to be taken by the G-. of I. and the Indian Legislature. The S. of S. is precluded by the Fiscal Convention from intervening to direct such a concession. As regards Sir P. Sethna’s point 4, it may be noted that, even if Indians have grievances in certain colonies, such as Kenya, where there are European settlers, they have no reason to fear such grievances in a colony such as Aden will become, where European settlement is out of the question. As regards point 7, there is no reason to fear that Indians actually in Govt, service in Aden will lose their appointments as a result of transfer. 7/e had heard previously that one Indian oificer - t-he Registrar of the Court - was apprehensive, ana accordingly mentioned the question generally uo Lr. i The effect of transfer on the Aden salt Cowell/Cowell of the C.O. He was quite clear that the fact of transfer can make no difference to Govt, servants, who will continue serving under existing conditions of service. The position with regard to employe^of local bodies such as the Port Trust and Aden Settlement Committee will obviously be similar. As regards the filling of posts that fall vacant, it would clearly be impossible to give any guarantee, but the probability is that a good proportion of Indians will find employment^for some time to come^ at any rate, in view of the backward state of Arab education, and the probable difficulty of finding other suitable candidates.linute Pap er « politi cal Department. Note of interview of sir P.Sethna with Mr .Butler tm 4 . OU yn Sir P.Sethna gave acme information regarding the debates in the Council of State on 31st August and the Legislative Assembly on 18th September, and some explanation of his own objections to transfer. (1) He stated that he did not object to Imperial control of the political and military administration and a clause to this effect had accordingly been included in the resolution passed by the Council of State. In the Legislative Assembly some members objected even to this but the Assembly had decided not to include such an objection in its resolution. (2) The Council of State resolution was that the civil administration should remain with the Government of India or be retransferred to Bombay . (The words underlined were an attempt to meet the statement in the announcement of 19th June that Aden would not naturally fit into the new Federation) (3) Sir P.Sethna suggested that the Government of India’s past pledges that no decision would be taken until the Legislature had had an opportunity of stating its views implied ths.t these views would not be disregarded and that Aden might be retained as part of India. (4) Sir P.Sethna laid great stress on his fear that Indians would not receive fair treatment under Crown Colony government, and instanced Kenya* Mr.Butler queried the suggestion that Indians are unfavourably treated in colonies and gave Fiji as an example of a c olony/Irnute 2 . Department. colony where their position is as good as that of the native inhabitants. Para. 6 of the announcement of 19th June gives a definite T'Sfensg’ on the subject. (5) In regard to Sir P.Sethna’s statement in the Council of State that India would lose 10 lakhs of revenue by the transfer, Mr.Butler informed him that we have asked the Government of India for detailed estimates of the civil revenue and expenditure, but that they have already informed us that these approximately balance. Sir P.Sethna stated that the Aden budget whieh shows a surplus of Rs. 60,000,^contains a hidden surplus of Rs.3 lakhs; sa he suggested that there had been some special expenditure (on the civil hospital, he thought) and also stated that the surplus, whatever it was, would grow. (6) He was asked by Mr.Butler to develop his statement in the Council of State that Indian trade with Aden would be lost owing to the inevitable departure of Indian merchants. He stated that merchants,not only Indians, but Jewish and Arabiresr, had left the Somaliland ports since the transfer of Somaliland to the Colonial Office. He said that Sir Hormusjee Dinshaw, who is one of the principal business men in Aden, is now in this country and that he would like to bring him to the India Office to explain the local Indian fears on this point. Mr.Butler invited him to do so. (7) Sir P.Sethna said that there was a fear that Indians in the public service at Aden would lose their appointments and that in any case posts which fell vacant/dinute Paper. Department. vacant would not go on being filled by Indians. Mr.Butler said that the Secretary of State was anxious to have Sir P.Sethna’s views and had therefore I • asked him to see him. As regards the position of the question of transfer,there is at present nothing to add |to what was stated in the announcement of 19th June.\ hle copy p.z SECRET IJ JRL/DIA&lt; (128 groups) 5295 ! h o 6 H From (COPIES CIRCULATED) Dated Received Government of India.

Jr b K L¥v Subject:-Proposed transfer of control of the Givii Administration of Aden to His Majesty f s Government. n m-omj Sir M— L&gt; / Ttie attention of the Gommittee of this association has been drawn to the proposed transfer of the control of the Civil Administration of Aden to His Majesty•s Government and I am directed to address you on this subject as followss- The proposal under reference has come as a great shocK to my Committee and at a time when the future constitution of the Country is in the making, it is apprehended that this move of His Majesty’s Government is contemplated to erect a strategic position and acquire a vantage point to keep the country down. Aden has been and will remain for all times a valuable asset to the Indian Government in matters commercial and Colonial. It has been rightly said that what Gibraltar is to Grain Britain, Aden is to India, and in the opinion of my Committee this move ox the British Government will greatly hamper the expansion of India’s trade by Sea under the new constitution when it is hoped, with popular control, the commercial and industrial policy of the Government of India will go a long way further in developing the trade of the country, whe n/ 1 '! i I J ;when Aden will play a very important part with its geographical position in functioning as a distributing centre ior the agricultural ana industrial proaucts of India in African, and Arabian provinces ana the Meditranian countries. ¥y Committee, with all the force at their command, respectfully wish to bring home to the Government of India, that Aden, if transferred to His Majesty’s Government, will deprive the Indian Commercial community ol an asset they hold, in the making of which, India’s millions ana business enterprise have nown freely, of which the present trade of Aaen, 3 salt woriis, many industrial concerns and the chief coastal steamship line are some of the results. In the Press Communique the Government advances the following reasons suggesting that Aaen shoula not remain linmea with Inaia under the new constitution:- 1. that it is an area geographically remote from India; 2. that it would not naturally fit into the new federation; 3. that it is already to some extent under Imperial control; and 4. that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate which has passed wholly out of Indian control. My Committee respectfully beg to submit that these reasons do not convince the Indian mina ox the oonafides of the proposed transfer. England is farther off If cm Aden than India and it is a matter of great surprise that such a reason should be advanced after Aaen has been linked to the Bombay Presidency ana the Government of India for about a hundred years. As regards the reason (2) it is not made clear why Aden should not fit into the new federation and no reasons/reasons are ascribed in support of this statement ana my Committee do not in any way see the reasonable ness of the statement which in its opinion is altogether flimsy. jhe third reason that it is already to some extent under Imperial control is opposed on a fundamental fact that during the world war the 1 ill tar y and politicai. administration oi Aden was temporarily taxen over oy the British Government, out after the war the Imperial Government was duty hound to restore the Military and political administration oi aden to India. Bven under the existing dual administration of 17-16 years there has been no conilict between Military ana Givil adminis trations of Aden although they have been conducted by different Governments - British and Indian and now it is not comprehensible why such a reason should at ail be advanced. The last reason does not hold in the face of what is submitted above. It is further submitted that besides the large Indian interests, the Government of India have spent very large sums on both the Civil and Military adminis tration of ^den. If for any undisclosed reasons the British Government persistt in their demand for xiden, in equity the Government of India should ins is it on reimbursement with interest of the amount with value of the properties. My Committee has memories of the condition of Indians in other colonies ana ir ^aen is also to become one of them then it is reared that Indian interests in Aden will not be safegaurded and the history of south Africa will repeat itself. In fact Aden is a place where India has vast vested interests and only the Indian/Indian Government o a n help her own people if they have the control of’ the adn inistration or aaen. My Goiriinittee trust that the Government will see the reason a ole ness or the demand made hy the entire mdian nation and oppose all efiorts of His Majesty’s Government to ‘caKe over ^den under her control, fhe Government ox India should not estrange the wishes of the people ol India, unanimously expressed as in this case, and should endeavour to assert openly the rights of India and its people. It is prayed that the Govern ment ol undid shourd no t acquiesce in the transfer of control without protest, as the subordinate department of the British Government. 1 have the honour to he, hir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/-Rupl a l bhankerdas.

Transferred to Secretary, Political Dept. 193 Extract from Official Retort of the LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY Debates. hate 193 , page ///Z-jF. MOTION BE FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. The Honourable Sir Joseph Bhore (Leader of the House) • Sir I move the motion which stands in my name, namely ; ’ “ That the Government of India communique, dated the 20th June 1933 the future administration of Aden, be taken into consideration.” ’ ’ regarding dhe opportunity tor discussion which this motion affords is given m fulfilment of an undertaking by the Political Secretary so far back as 1922, an undertaking which has at least implicitlv if not expresslv been subsequently endorsed, that the Government would come to no final conclusion without giving the Legislature an opportunity for the discussion of this matter. The communique sets out the considerations in favour of the transfer of control, the arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government should it be eventually decided to transfer control and the financial consequences to India of such a transfer. I need hardly assure the House that the views expressed here will be most anxiously and carefully considered by the Government of India and they will, of course, be forwarded for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. In addition, regard will also have to be paid to the views expressed outside this Chamber and to the views expressed by interests concerned both in India and in Aden. Before discussion begins I ought, however, to take an opportunity of removing possible misapprehensions and of giving certain information to the House which may assist it in coming to a conclusion. I noticed during the course of discussions on a similar motion in another place that the suggestion was made—I would put it no higher than that—that Government had gone back on a declaration made by Sir Denys Bray in 1929 that all idea of the transfer of Aden from India had long since been abandoned. Now, Sir, anybody who studies the remarks of the Foreign Secretary in their proper context will, I am sure, not persist in that suggestion. He could not possibly do it. What obviously the Foreign Secretary meant ivas. that the transfer of Aden had been abandoned as a solution of the post-war controversy in regard to the future of Aden because this question had been settled by the decision of His Majesty’s Govern ment in December, 1926, and the transfer of the civil administration was, therefore, in 1929. not a live issue. Obviously, the Foreign Secretary’s undertaking that the House would be given an opportunity of prior consultation would have been entirely meaningless if he had meant that the idea of, transfer would never be considered at all.

If the subject- this reference may be returnedFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. ' 17 me to another point. The Foreign Secretary, Major Fraser-Tytler, in answering a question put by my Honourable friend, Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh, gave an undertaking to furnish the House with the views of those interests which were concerned in this matter. As the House is, I think, fully seized of the views expressed in India, I will confine myself as far as possible to the views expressed in Aden. % The House is aware that the Indian population of Aden numbers 7,287 out of a total of 46,638, and I may say at once that Indian opinion is defimtely opposed to the separation of Aden from India. We come next to the Arabs. The Arabs number 29,820 out of a population, as 1 have said, of 46,638 according to the census of 1931. The Arabs are content with the existing sj stem ot administration which they would like to see continue ; but, since constitutional developments in India would make this impossible, they would, on the w'hole, prefer that the administration of Aden should be controlled by His Majesty’s Govern ment. They fear, under the Federation, the subordination of Arab interests and a progressive increase in the commercial domination of Indian firms. On the other hand, they desire that the following existing conditions should be continued if transfer takes place, namely, (a) Aden should remain a free port, (d) taxes and other dues to remain as they are, (c) laws and local regulations to remain as at present and [d) all existing civil rights of inhabitants to be maintained. If these are not to be maintained, they are opposed to transfer. They are also apprehensive lest the annual contribution of 20 lakhs should, in the event of transfer, be recovered from them by His Majesty’s Govern ment. On this point I take this opportunity of assuring them that their apprehension is groundless. In this event, that is to say, of transfer the charge would be borne by His Majesty’s Government.’ Now, Sir, I think I have given the House as much information as 1 am in a position to do. I need only say that Government will take no part in the discussion except to remove misapprehensions and to provide any relevant information which they may have in their posses sion. Sir, 1 move.

The amendment that stands in the name of Messrs. Ranga Iyer, Mody and A. Das acquiesces in the transfer of military and political control but objects to the transfer of civil control.

The amendment adopted by the other House, only the other day, demands the retention of only the civil administration of Aden under the Government of India. On the present occasion also, the Government of India have adopted the attitude of the same bene volent neutrality of 1921 and, as a result of such a neutrality, I will not all| a ;- 5 e surprised, if a few months later, the civil administration is also Ayil are pit ransferred to the Home Government at our back just as the political and . Military administration was transferred surreptitiously. It is no wonder, Gir, that the people of this country have lost all faith in the bona fides of lie present bureaucracy as well as of the British Parliament. This ques- ion of the transfer of the control of Aden is only one link in the chain if multifarious false hopes and promises made to the people of this country lever to be redeemed by actions. Sir, 1 am not one of those to believe inly in the retention of the civil administrative control of Aden under the British Indian administration. The amendment, which was accepted by he other House, if adopted by this House, as well, will give the world utside the impression that Indian opinion will be fully satisfied if only .. he civil administration is kept under the Government of India. ransWlM fot oteiiiii | Sir, I do not believe in half measures. My objection to this transfer hipB f military and political control in 1927 without our consent is more IV' jrious than that of the proposed transfer of civil administration. Aden. St oi life! one of the most important strategic points in the sea route between and the West. I hope I will not be taken as a wild visionary, if say that I belierve, and believe it sincerely, that a day will come when idia will have the dominion status like the other dominions and the iture Government will certainly have the control of their own navies, ontlijs: ercan tile marine and the Army. Consequently, the future adminis- nmt ill: ia t ors 0 f the Indian Government must desire to have the controlling OTeriifflU: )wer over such strategic points like Aden. Sir, this transfer of control i teeaiate; Aden, to my mind, is another link in the chain of manceuvres of the fhey Wifitish Government to have British control over all strategic ports ^Sween Singapore and Gibraltar. I am not going to narrate here how ic British Government got the control of Soudan and Egypt and also adually obtained a partial control of the Suez. This transfer of control military and political administration of Aden to the Home Government litaithout our consent shows clearly the lurking suspicions in the minds of the ritish politicians that India may at any time get dominion status or ] r en independence and, with that suspicion in their minds, they have ken away the control of military and political administration in the jeth of Indian opposition. Sir, 1 do not for a moment see any other thfimnS-ason than the one just now stated by me for the British Government Bd bureaucracy to adopt the hush hush methods when the military and floptical control of Aden was transferred in 1927. Since the transfer of jit) litary administration in 1927, another rumour was afloat for, the ansfer of civil control in 1929, when Government reiterated their promise stating that all idea of such transfer had long since been .'^eiiEiandoned. Again, in 1931, when the Aden administration was trans- sjgwired to the Government of India, an apprehension was raised in the sition ’ nc ^ ^ le Indian public, that it was the thin end of the wedge for its ^ rete yt!te L2S8LAD s1722 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. [ 16 th Sept. [Mr. Bhuput Sing.] subsequent transfer to the Home Government Immediately a deputy tion of those, vitally interested m the Aden trade, waited, on His Excellency the’ Viceroy and Governor General, and it was definitely stated on that occasion that the proposals for the transfer of the control of Aden from Bombay Government to the Government of India were complete in themselves and were made on their own merits. Further on the Foreign Secretary stated on that occasion that the changed adl ministrative control of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government, of India was not a step towards any other change. In the course of the discussion with the said deputation, His Excellency Viceroy Lord Willingdon, intervened and emphatically endorsed Foreign Secretary’s statements in connection with the apprehended transfer of corftrol of Aden to the Colonial Office and, in order to allay I the misgivings of the deputationists, he stated further that no such sug. nestion had been considered and gave a definite undertaking that, should this question be re-opened in future, all interests and parties would be consulted In spite of such an assurance, just after the lapse of about two vears the White Paper saw the light of day with a small cryptic reference made therein regarding the question, m which it was stated, that the question of the future administrative arrangements for Aden were under consideration. Immediately a few British Indian delegates t 0 the Joint Select Committee, who werq then present m London, waited on a deputation to the Secretary of State on the question of the future of Aden and they were told that Aden, being neither a province nor an Tmbnn ’state the question of its being included m the future Indian Federation was a very difficult one, but however, he did not think that the difficulty was of such a nature, as not to admit of a satisfactory solution After all these false promises, the Government of India had the courage to issue the Press Communique m June last. Sir the Pres Communique starts with the fact that Aden is already to some extent under Imperial control. But may I ask the Government of India, whether they were or were not a consenting partydo the transfer of military and political control ? Then,_ I would further ask them how far thev committed India to that portion of the control already transferred to the Home Government and whether they obtoned the views of the Indian public and of the Legislature to the part a transfer of control already made and which has been mentioned m h Communique. If they have not committed themselves to ^ch transfer, this House, to my mind, should unanimously repudiate the whole acton of the Government of India in this matter. In coming to the next argument of geographical remoteness of Adm from India, may I ask the Government whether such geographical ^ moteness of Gibraltar from England stands in the way of its control y the Home Government ? Sir, if, owing to remoteness of Aden India, it is to be transferred to the Home Government then I wouW y that Aden should be transferred to the Arabs, and Gnwaltar Spaniards. I thought. Sir, that there was bankruptcy m British stai manship, but it is a new experience to me that there is um rup common sense amongst the members of the British Cabinet, bu. or , P they, who are governing Singapore, Malta and Gibraltar from ci nnartorc; in Hrppf Britain which is geographically so distant anFI TI RE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 17^3 m - y j from those places, would not have raised objections to India's administer- r y- ing Aden, owing to geographical remoteness. l aiitihil Before I conclude, I think I should put it in a nutshell that Great TOnt Britain is very keen and bent upon getting the control of Aden to make it in C last, another naval* base in the west of India as they have made Singapore a [ en is i- naval base in the east of India so that India may always be kept between I asltthcse two fires. Considering all these factors I hope that the House will agree with me when I say that arrangements should be made for the re- j r transfer of the military and political control to the British Indian adni nis- I port®liltratHm with whom the civil administration is existing at present. With I these words. I move my amendment and commend it to the House for its ,e4ti!!? am? P tanee - stafflti! Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Cketty) : nsplvs to r Amendment moved : Tiiat for the original motion the following be substituted : 1 la view of the fact that- the Military and Political Control of Aden have been transferred to the Home Government without obtaining the consent^ of the Indian Legislatures inspite of the promise by the Government of India in 1S21 to the contrary and in view of the fact that Aden formed an integral part of the British Indian Administration for about a century this Assembly requests the Governor General in Council to convey to His Majesty 's Government the emphatic protest of this House about the transfer of the said control and the desire of the people of India that the proposed transfer of further control should not be effected and that the Militarv and Political control should be retransferred to the Government of India ’. ’ ’ Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shamnukham Chetty) : Docs ( the Honourable Member, Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad, wish to move his amend ment ? Dr Zianddin Ahmad (United Provinces Southern Divisions : Muham madan Rural) : Yes, Sir. I beg to move : “ That for the original motion the following be substituted : 1 While recording their emphatic protest against the complete transfer to the Colonial Office of Aden Settlement which has for about a century been an integral part of British Indian Administration, the Assembly requests the Governor General in Council to convey to His Majesty s tTO&gt;ernm the strong desire of the people of India that the proposed transrer s on not take place \ ’ ’ Sir. at the outset I should like to make clear the distinction between Aden Administration and Aden Protectorate. Now. the Aden belt e- ment consists of a very small tract of land, about nine miles long and two miles wide, and it is practically an island just like Bombay, because one place it is only about a furlong wide and the sea water goes over n^. Now. as regards the Protectorate of Aden, we have nothing to say ; that ^ a question for the Imperial Government to settle and India is not directly connected in the Aden Protectorate. But we are dhec. y con cerned with what is caHed the Aden Settlement. It should not be confused with the Aden Settlement. This Aden was occupied by Major %ley in 1839. with the help of Indian forces taken from Bombay, ibe population of Aden at that time was only 3.000. The Honoma &gt; e lie deader of the House has given the latest figures of the population I have got also the round figures. On account of the development of the poit, fhe population of Aden increased from 3,000 in 1839 to about oo. on °f which about 30,000 are Arabs. 10,000 are Indians, 4.000 are Jews. 0 . 0 UU are Europeans and 7,000 are Somalis. Now, Aden has got a very peculiar Position about the port. It is well* protected and surrounded on ail sides L298LAD ^ iFn® 1724 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. [ 16 th Sept. 1933 - ifliintocnM [Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad.] by rocks and hills and we have to go through a narrow strip in order to reach the port of Aden. This port of Aden was developed almost entirely by Indian capital. The Indians spent something like five crores of rupees in order to build wharves, godowns and warehouses and a large number of buildings. At the same time, the Indian Government spent large sums^ of money in developing the fortress and barracks and for carrying on Ik ' : ® a(lf ' 111 civil and military administration. I have got no accurate knowledge of the amount which the Indian Government spent on this account, but Mr. Cook, in a speech, in the year 1921, said that the expenditure was in the neighbourhood of 50 lakhs a year. Taking the statement of Mr. Cook, ks a pedioi in 1921, I can safely conclude that the expenditure of the Government of India must have been between 30 and 40 crores of rupees ; and, consider- in i is ing the expenditure both by the Indian people and the Indian Government, viiellc I can safely say that the Aden Settlement was developed by incurring an expenditure of between 35 and 40 crores of rupees by the people and the aat. Government of India. Now, whenever any question of a transfer comes in, i the question of 40 crores should not be overlooked. We should get the amount back with compound interest. The vast 'expenditure both by the z;. But, a people and by the Government, and the hard work of Indian Merchants developed favourable situation and the safety attracted a large number of foreign people, the Arabs, Jews, Somalis, and Europeans. They came to Aden to enjoy a prosperous life which the Indian money and Indian brain created for them. Sfflsfetwasl [At this stage, Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) vacated the Chair which was then occupied by Mr. Deputy Pre sident (Mr. Abdul Matin Chaudhury).] Now, this increase of population from neighbouring countries naturally developed their trade relations with the countries from which these people came, and the Indians of Aden were the first to open trade relations between Aden and Africa and Aden and Arabia, and they built up their country crafts and their country steamers in order to carry on their trade. They went further ; they also built up an Indian steam navigation company which is now carrying goods from Aden to the neigh bouring places in Arabia and in Africa. lallffi. h: *WS10I1( 1: $ tkat tket ^Wia. It %aeiit ( Sir, the civil administration has always been under the Governmen of Bombay till the year 1931 and the taxes were collected on behalf of the s ^iii In Bombay Government. The administration was carried on on the ; lines as the administration in the Bombay PTesidency. They opened schools, they built hospitals and they had the same system of administra tion as is carried on in the Bombay Presidency. Changes occurred during the war and, as a war measure, the War Office occupied and took possession , of the whole administration of Aden. But that was only a war admmistra- ^ tion and it was handed back to us as soon as the war was over in the year 1919. Sir, we, Indians, had no personal quarrel with Germany or other . !lf enemy countries. We really fought, because of the British Government as we formed part of the British Empire. After the war was over, the various countries, who had taken part in the war, were given rewards, bands taken out from Germany w r ere given to East Africa, West Africa and to South Africa and so on, but may I ask what India obtained for large sums of money she spent in the war, and also for the loss of lives ? We always urged on the floor of the House that in'return for the services which Incu I wasV FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1725 rendered to the British Government we should have been given some share in the war indemnities ot‘ the allies in the shape of a Colony in Africa, but instead of that, something is taken away from us ; we are supposed to be good and loyal subjects of the British Empire and w r e are made to believe that we can always count on their help ; but when the ques tion of distribution of reward comes in, we are passed over. We ip' naturally expected that India would be given some territory for her war and lorrServices, but, instead of that we are threatened to lose what we ourselves ) wwl: built by our own money. Our services, our sacrifices in men and money it on feu are all forgotten, and without any reference to Legislature the military eipr control was transferred from the Indian Government to the Home Govern- statel ment. This is a question, Sir, on which we have strong views, and we toflfr strongly protest such a course of action and I agree with my friend, ! nM:£ Mr. Bhuput Sing, in his strong protest. We had not forgotten the high ttoMiar handed policy of the Home Government in transferring military control, tyd i they raised the question of the transfer of civil administration of the jjlp.v Aden Settlement. One can argue that the protectorate does not toim 10 {' a i r; ' part of the Indian Government, and the army is required for the broader j f,, purpose of the protectorate, and not for maintaining order and peace in the Settlement. But, at the same time, I do maintain that even it t e i. .&lt; i r , proposed transfer was to be made, it ought to have been made wih e ..i\C consent of the Indian Government and Indian Legislature and this House should have been given an opportunity to discuss the whole question, before the transfer of the military control from Indian Government to ome Government. I consider such transfer as breach of contract, lue s r y did not end here. In 1927, Honourable Members will probably rememt er that Sir Denys Bray, replying to a question in this House, said : hasten to add that all idea of such a transfer (transfer of Aden pe emen has long been abandoned ”. The Commander-in-Chief also m the yea 1927. on the occasion of the Budget debate in the Council o k a t, ^ “As Honourable Members are aware, the Settlement of Aden have a very great extent by our fellow Indian subjects.

[16th Sept. 1933. urn® [Dr. Zianddin Ahmad.] from the Bombay Government to the Government of India, we scented that there was g-oing to be further trouble in store, and immediately a deputation, led by Mr. Mehta, waited on His Excellency the Viceroy, and the Political Secretary gave us to understand that it v T as only being trans ferred for the sake of convenience. We then thought that probably it was the first step to the second transfer from the Government of India to tk Colonial Office. But, at that time, we were given an assurance that nothing would be done to prejudice the interests of this country, and we naturally trusted the Government. What hidden interpretation can nvy Honourable friend put on it ? || I “ 1 carry ■ I us. Sir, the question of Aden is somewhat different from the question of Burma. In regard to Burma, I can quite understand that the whole decision should be left to the people of Burma. If they want separation, let them have it ; but if they don’t want to separate themselves from us, we will always welcome them and we are ready to help them ; but, in the case of Aden, it is a different proposition. The people of Aden do not want a transfer. Those Indians, who have got their investments in Aden do not want a transfer, Arabs don’t want a transfer, the Jews don’t want a transfer. No one wants a transfer. The Home Government desired to confiscate it simply because we are weak. The Honourable the Leader of the House quoted the resolution passed by few Arabs who really belong to the protectorate and he did not mention the resolution passed by 500 Arabs residing in the Settlement. Sir. in reply to a deputation led by His Highness the Aga Khan, to which reference was made by my friend, Mr. Bhuput Sing, the Secretary of State gave a clear reply that the difficulties were not ‘ ‘ insurmountable ” ; no political problem is insoluble, ifwve put our heads together. The Members of the Round Table Conference and of the Joint Select Committee, who are now working in London, will not find difficulty to find a solution, and I hope they w r ill do so. It may be said that it is very difficult to secure their representation in the Federation. I do not know when the Federation is coming. It may not come in the lifetime of any of us who are now present in the Assembly, and it is some what premature to discuss this question. But even if the Federation comes into existence immediately, the position of the Aden Settlement will be similar to other important places like Secunderabad, Bangalore ana other towns v/hich have only Municipalities under the control of the Go \ ernment of India and which will always remain under the Government Oo_ India, and, therefore, I see no difficulty in keeping the Aden Settlement also under the Government of India, like those small places which I have just mentioned and which will continue to remain under the Government of India. ito [jstk *31 pi 1 atontial (M Office! stfallKirtoi Nowq Sir, coming to the financial side, at present Aden is a pay! 11 ? concern to the Government of India. Aden was a source of great expendi ture for a very long time, but now 7 it is the other w 7 ay round. The income from Aden is about 18| lakhs and the expenditure is about 10| lakhs, and so, really speaking, Aden is not a burden to the Indian Budget. As regards e military expenditure, if we take the military expenses, from a broader point of view 7 and not only from the point of view 7 of India, only for the purpose s of protecting the routes, I should say, the expenses ought not to be orne by India alone, but also by all those countries wdio are benefited by ie position of Aden.

The previous it ® not M 11 ' speakers have made it clear that India is not getting her constitutional jjJ liiinistra rights about Aden. Sir, facing the problem of Aden, I have to ask d can do the question, not of the Government of India, because I am grateful to .gstbe tran: them for being neutral in this matter whether in the debates in the j gibers of other House or today on the floor of this House, but of the British Government. If I can interpret, I feel that it is always an atmosphere of mistrust of the Britishers against the Indians. The ill treatment of Indians by the Colonial Governments has already been referred to. ,; ;(l y the That is one reason why we do not want Aden, where so many thousands ij^tkek of British Indians live, to be transferred to the Colonial Secretary of t^ral His Majesty’s Government. ictt of India w I miss here my Honourable friend, Mr. Bajpai, and the Honourable gid should Sir Fazl-i-IIusain who always speak for the administration of Indians k are the su overseas in the British colonies. Sometimes I find Mr. Bajpai’s heart flows with the milk of human kindness when he describes the distressing _ ^ :to circumstances of those refugees from South Africa who are living in great difficulty at Budge Budge in Calcutta and also says thaktheir condition is not so bad as described by questioners like Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh or Mr. Maswood Ahmad. Sir, we know what happened to the Indians who went to Natal, w T ho went to South Africa, how these barren lands were tilled and made arable by the Indian settlers, and how today they have been hounded out from South Africa. The same is the con dition in Kenya, in Tanganyika. In Kenya, Indians have lost their wheat trade. In Tanganyika, they have got their cotton trade, Indians are treated there as pariahs ; they have not got the same status as the post-war British settlers who are demanding today advantages and privileges that are denied to the British Indians. So, if we feel distrust at the proposal of the transfer of the civil administration of Aden to the British Government, we have precedents. The precedents dtkyde: are written in the blood and suffering of millions of Indians that are '»^ suffering today in the colonies of South Africa, Tanganyika, Kenya and East African territories. That is one aspect. mr I want to examine a little in detail where lies the confidence of 4 p.m. British Government and the Britishers in the Indians. Do they trust us ? I say they do not. They want us to trust their words, but they do not trust us. If Aden had been admin istered for nearly 70 years by the Bombay Government and the Govern merit of India, what has happened today to transfer or to propose tbe Mi tie ink Beminb It i transfer of the civil administration of that territory to the Colonial Government ? At this stage, I wish to make it clear that I ani suppor - ing the motion which has been moved by my Honourable f r i en ’ Mr. Bhuput Sing. It is a most comprehensive one and reflects the re feeling of the Indians who are sitting on this side of the House and w o represent the teeming millions that are outside this House. If? during baited to the War. the military administration of Aden was transferred to the , British Government, there was no necessity for the transfer of that administration perpetually. It has been done, and the Government Tndia,^ as^ I observed a few moments ago, is a subordinate branch of the ^ British Government and had to agree. When they trot out the savin^ of a few lakhs of rupees, one laughs at such an argument. It is often saiFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1729 that Aden is the Gibraltar of the British Dominion ofAmrtralia, ttie * Malaya tensrSdilns with the control'of the ,1 her thumb.

[16th Sept. 1933. mruBH i %, Mi sad the ( [Mr. B. Das.] place. That is no solace to us. Aden might be a free port, but once the control passes out of our hands, similar pretexts will be brought out as happened in the case of East Africa or South Africa and Aden will be closed to the trade of India. Incidentally, I am reminded of a little stir created by the Anglo-Indian Press. As far as I can remember, it was the Statesman which published an editorial inciting the feelings I of the Bengalis who have got a little feeling towmrds Aden, because their taste is for Cheshire salt. I do not wish to refer to that sort of managed 1 agitation carried on particularly by the Statesman. It has been ably! replied to by a prominent business magnate, my esteemed friend, y Mr. Husseinbhoy Laljee of Bombay, and, I am sure, the Government idamiwl have read it. I hope they v r ill send a copy of it to the Secretary of isitowa State for his perusal. Then, point 4 says that His Majesty’s Govern- ifcmMt. ment would do their utmost to maintain the present standard of admin- suites a»( istration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a ^ in any course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. Every sentence r begins with a rider and a qualifying clause. Suppose there is a war and the King of the Hedjaz invades Aden, then there will be further taxation. This kind of pledge cannot satisfy us. We all know the policy of His Majesty’s Government in other Colonies, how Indians were asked to pay the poll tax even, which happens to be a most inhuman tax. We are asked to trust to the mere verbiage. My friend, the Honourable the Foreign Secretary, is present here, and may I ask him what were the traditions of the Foreign Offices before the wmr ? Hush hush policy, intrigues, secrecy, these were the things with which they started the Great War. I do not blame the Foreign Office of His Majesty’s Govern ment alone. I blame the Foreign Offices of every Sovereign Govern ment. I do not think my Honourable friend, the Foreign Secretary, is carrying on those intrigues, but that has been the tradition of other„ . Foreign Offices. Their policy had been to set one nation against the other. I expect that, in the near future, w 7 e will also have our Foreign Office and if we will have our control over it, \Ve will start with a clean slate. Our policy' will be the policy of truth and righteousness and not of intrigues. Mr. B V. Jadhav (Bombay Central Division : Non-Muhammadan Rural) : Utopia. ’ m Mr. B. Das : My Honourable friend, Mr. Jadhav, might have had aA sisoftr inkling of the Political Department of the Bombay Government while 4passes he was a Minister in that Government. * An Honourable Member : He was not allowed to see anything. Mr. B. Dias : It may be thought to be an Utopia by some of my friends here. But the Great War, with its massacre of millions of peopb cost the world billions of money, the gold for which my Honourable fnen t ^leBritii the Finance Member, is so very 7 anxious to retain in his Reserve Bank. I 11 Great War taught us one lesson. these Foreign Offices and their satellites and the ° world will live , peacefully and more amicably. So, Sir, this point 4 is an expression which not only my Honourable friend, the Foreign Secretary, but even the lowest paid clerk in his office can set aside as valueless. «if, % Now, let me examine point No. 5 — the proportion of Indians won be retained in the Aden Service for some years. Sir, once the transS^BFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1731 takes place, not only those Indians, who are in service, but even those beafe ffko have settled down there would be turned out from there bag and !textsi; Daggage. Even martial law may be declared there on the pretext that k Indians are agitating there and are a seditious people. Then I come to point No. 6 —no racial legislation, or segregation vould be permitted by His Majesty’s Government. Sir, If I understand he English language, the word 11 would ” does not indicate that there any guarantee that no racial legislation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government. Has it not been permitted in South Africa, m 11 n Kenya, in Tanganyika and other places ? Can we even read with a ^grain of confidence this point No. 6 , which His Majesty ’s Government sure,§ iave advanced and which my Honourable friend, the Leader of the it to I louse, wants us to swallow and to believe in the pledges of H 1S His If Majesty’s Government. As my Honourable friend, Mr. Bhuput S'ng, sent stall laid a few minutes ago, Britain has broken so many pledges that n d ia tffltii -sannot believe in any of these pledges. ' Sir, these are no pledges, t ey essarv. Lire mere pious expressions put in the sophistic language of the Foreign Department or the Colonial Department. [At this stage, Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham r '’ ! jhetty) resumed the Chair.1 lanswt;;- •' . . intaiM Sir, I must now refer as to why Britain has changed its po icy. , tie B lentlemen administering the Foreign Office of the Government of n ]a sk invstarted the Russian bogey and the Afghan bogey.

Anklesaria (Bombay Northern Division : Non-Muham- ^iyftleset madan Rural) : Sir, I support the amendment of my Honourable friend, Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad, and oppose the amendment of my Honourable friend, Mr. Bhuput Sing. A is Sir K u exagg Ipij of po rants at pn say year b 3, lie £150,( tl i year, At the outset I must express my surprise at the attitude which the Government Members propose to take up in connection with the present motion. Sir, very telling arguments, based on facts and reasoning, were addressed on the present matter in the other place by Sir Phiroze Sethna and those arguments do require an answer from the Government Benches. That answer not having come, we are left to our own conjectures as regards the case which the Government Benches have on the present matter. The Government of India are the guardians and protectors of the interests of India, and in a matter like the present, which is vitally concerned with the interests of India, we should have expected that the Government would have given us advice and guidance, but they propose to be silent. I can understand their position if there was some written or unwritten rule of constitutional practice which debars them from giving expression to their honest opinions on the floor of the House. I am quite sure that no such rule exists, because had it existed, it 'would have applied equally to the Provincial Governments, but what do -we find ? On the last occasion, when the question of the transfer of Aden was before the Bombay Council, Sir Ernest Hotson expressed 1 himself in unmistakable terms as to the real wishes and desires of the Bombay Government. In the other House, in 1922, the Honourable Mr. Pratt, w r ho represented the Bombay Government there, expressed in unmistakable terms his opposition to the proposal of separation of Aden from India. I say, why should the Government of India not come forward and express their opinion on the floor of the House on the present occasion and give us advice and guidance. If the Government of India are silent, because they believe that the argument on which His Majesty’s Government base their proposal for the separation of Aden from India has neither reason nor justice behind it, then, I say my Party and myself wholeheartedly agree with that opinion aod belief and we earnestly and respectfully invite the Government Benches G j to express themselves clearly on the floor of the House today- Th® arguments, in support of the proposal for transfer of Aden from India, are fourfold. The arguments are based on constitutional grounds, on geographical grounds, on grounds of economy and, fourthly, there is the argument of the fait accompli. As regards the geographic^ arguments, it is based on the difficulty of administering Aden from sue ^ a distance as separates Aden from India. Now 7 , in. the firs^ place, this ^ presupposes that there has not been up till now good administration o ^ Aden. But what are the real facts ? The communique contains o opinion of His Majesty’s Government as regards the present standard it ?et is is ii S. My scomit] of administration of Aden. In. fact. His Majesty’s Government pro- Ai pose _ to _ take the present standard of administration as their own ^ as standard of administration in the future. Secondly, His Majesty s jro\ ornment ought to have known that Whitehall is more distant ;rom Aden than India. As regards the argument based on constitution 17 la&lt;FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1733 facts aiii* ir 01 ojE' ics tee *i :uardiais u!: e re | Ivice aiiJ eir pitioai: Srnest Hots« { ,rof^ itius®,; dm * uMZi itiif**' tiOD idly. is’O erounds, it is said that it is very difficult to fit in Aden m the coming Indian Federation. I can understand this argument if it is a question of fitting in the whole of the Aden protectorate in the Indian Federa tion but the question involved on the present occasion is simply that of fitting in of the settlement of Aden in the Indian Federation and I see absolutely no constitutional difficulty about it. It is then said that the transfer of Aden will save India from the burden of about 20 lakhs of rupees. As Sir Phiroze Sethna pointed out in the other House, this is of course an exaggeration. I am sure, the Honourable the Finance Member will be able to correct the facts of His Majesty’s Government on the present topic. The Honourable Sir George Schuster (Finance Member) : As my Honourable friend has referred to me in the matter, I should like .o take this opportunity of pointing out that the statements made by the Honour able Sir Phiroze Sethna in the Council of State were calculated to^ gn e a somewhat misleading impression of the position. The position is tins, that the contribution, from which India would be saved, if this transfer oo^ place, amounts at present to something like £ 120,000 on the past year s estimates. We have not yet got the final accounts for the year. Put i might in any year be as much as £150,000 and, in fact, in past years, it was as much as that. That is clear gain to India, a sum amounting to something like £150,000. On the other side, there will be no loss on me scale indicated by the Honourable Sir Phiroze Sethna. At present, tne Aden budget almost, one might say exactly, balances. Taking the aver age from 1927-28 to 1933-34, the average showed a deficit ot about two- third lakhs a year. At present, there is a slight favourable balance o. a ferv thousands, but the present position is precarious, because the oa ance is obtained by maintaining special economies which probably eauno _ re maintained indefinitely. I think the fairest way of looking at it is ia the Aden budget is practically evenly balanced. I think if we take it m that way, there is no gain or no loss one way or the other on accoun the ordinary administrative expenditure and that the military con n u tion will be a* clear gain. This is the most accurate way m v m i o gard the effects of this proposal for transfer of Aden. Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad : There seems to be some confusion. Out of the budget of £ 120,000 for civil administration, a portion is for uumn^ expenditure. It was stated on one occasion that no military ivas loqinicc for the eml administration, but it was really required for pieser\mg ^ trade routes. My submission is that the military is requires oi uc , fit of all the countries affected on the trade route and, theie oie, i amount should not fall on India. Had the military been require T .. Aden Settlement, then it would have been a legitimate chaige on _ finance, but if it is required for the Aden protectorate or or oe • of the trade routes, then it is not correct that India shou. P a &gt; expenditure. The Honourable Sir George Schuster : My Honourable friend is under a misapprehension, if he thinks we are paying 1(1 ' v ' • expenditure. India is paying one-third of the expenditure mum of £150,000 a year. Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty)^ In mcaa °f the importance of the financial consideration, the 01734 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. [16th Sept. 1933. [Mr. President.] Finance Member will be well advised to intervene in the debate and ma*» ., )arr yofltt a full statement about the financial implications. Mr. N. N Anklesaria : Sir, if the statement of the Honourable the «Aite Finance Member has conduced the House that I am incorrect in the ii^nardin statement which I made, I will simply say that I stand corrected. IBkgls oi the w Passing now to the fourth class of arguments, namely, the arguments based on what they call a fait accompli, I am a very humble individual. at ^ mfhTK but 1 cannot help saying that His Majesty’s Government have not shown good sense in giving expression to such an argument in support of their riioa, Sir, I proposal. Sir, the argument of j’y sms et j’y reste is an argument which * matter any f a strong man, when he has got no reason or justice in support of such an lieiiav act argument, addresses to the weak man. It never carries conviction ; it which i irritates and it creates discontent and it also creates, if the discontent is itleloiioiirabh prolonged, disaffection. Sir, when I say all this I am not oblivious of the mjoms on 1 fact vhat every Indian is interested in the upholding and the maintenanediAialMml of that glorious phenomenon which we call the British Empire,—as much ^ interested as any other member of the British Empire. And I furtiir say that there is none in this House so very unpatriotic and so very lack- ing in the pride of his British citizenship as not to whole-heartedly vote in support of a proposal like the present, if it could be proved that such support was necessary for the maintenance of the British Empire. I' y* ™ have looked through the arguments in the communique and I fail to any argument which would show that if the support, such as I mention, were withheld, the British Empire would dissolve into nothingness. Sir, -h speech, on the other hand there are arguments which ought to carry great con- leHousi viction to His Majesty’s Government and induce them to refrain from further prosecuting the present project. The prospect of separation has or less created a good deal of discontent in this country, discontent which no J iclore,Id 0 good Government could possibly ignore. I will not indulge in exaggerat- 'wliditfi ed language and talk of “ the rape of Aden ”, or of “ the open day l° ot ”Lestion fl f ^ or of ‘‘ the scandalous act of expropriation ”, but this much I may that it is hard on the British Indians, who have by investment of capital ^ ai) ,, and energy in the development of Aden acquired vested interest in it ®^^ ^ which they cannot easily and advantageously divest themselves if 1 choose to leave Aden. I must also say that it is not fair to British India,a after it has spent enormous sums of money amounting to crores of rupees 11 in the development of Aden and when that sacrifice and that investment ^ ^ are on the eve of bearing fruit, to take away Aden from India. JBfc i s T hirdly, Sir, there is the question of the pledges given by responsible British Indian statesmen. My Honourable friend, the Leader 0 ^ T ,^acts House, tried to explain away the pledge given by Sir Denys Bray. If^ ^ explanation has carried conviction to the House, I have nothing further to say. Sir, I also share the fears of Indians who have made Aden them, Home about their position under the jurisdiction of the Colonial ' e ; Those fears are by no means imaginary as would be shown by the ph| of Indians in the different British possessions under the jurisdiction of Colonial Office. The present condition of the neighbouring places h Berbera, Bulbar and Zaila furnish significant instances of what Mien may have in store for her if she is transferred completely to the Colonial ^ Office. No doubt, Sir, the communique of His Majestv’s Government does give assurances against racial discrimination, but I am afraid the assuram-s 4,iuvFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1735 t of tie cannot reassure Indian opinion. On the plea of once bitten twice shy, we Indians would simply decline to believe in the ability of His Majesty's Government to carry out those assurances, however much we may believe in the sincerity and bona fides of the present advisers of Ilis Majesty’s Government who have' given those assurances. How many times similar : :I assurances for safeguarding the interests of Indians as against the unrea- ! sonablc demands of the white settlers have been honoured in the breach .Mir rather than in the observance by His Majesty’s Government ! If the venk Government Members wish, I am prepared to give them a list of instances OTiraf in point. leatiu i n conclusion, Sir, I would appeal to His Majesty’s Government not Garni to press the matter any further at the present time lest, small as it may einsT appear to be, it may act as the proverbial cloud which may darken the Mrs momentous issues which are now before the two countries. I would also if a: appeal to the Honourable Members of the Government of India to come am nor forward and express on the floor of this House their-complete agreement 12 at: with the non-official Members in the present connection. By so doing they itiiEmvouid, in my opinion, command more regard and more confidence from mpk is this side of the House than they would be doing by remaining silent ; and riot; a- also, in the words of my friend, Mr. Ranga Iyer, “ that way lies statesman- a #■;■: ship Mr. B. R. Puri (West Punjab : Non-Muhammadan) : Sir, on behalf of my Party, I entirely endorse the amendment proposed by my liijiHa Honourable friend, Mr. Bhuput Sing. I, however, do not wish to in- ' flict any lengthy speech, because most of the matter is already within the int iG cognisance of the House. The matter was thrashed out in the Council l)t : of State, and most of the arguments addressed on the floor of this House A® have been more or less a repetition of what has already been said else- pet’ where. Therefore, I do not wish to follow that course. It seems to me, Sir, that a very light view should be taken of the matter. This question of Aden reminds me of a well known saying of Lord Charles Beresford who received on one occasion an invitation to stay in a country housb, and he sent the following telegram in reply : “ Sorry, cannot come, lie follows by post ”. The fact of the matter was that he could not possibly go, and in the telegram he stated candidly also promis ing to send the usual false excuse by post. Sir, it seems to me that Aden b already taken away, and the present ceremony corresponds to the he which we have received by post. This is an empty form through which we are going. As a matter of fact, if the British Government, in spite or their assurances and undertakings, solemn as they were, are guilty of 0 ' having committed acts of breach of faith, how can we now expect that, ^ Ik ^ compliance with our wishes, they are going to reconsider the whole ])$( Programme regarding Aden which they must have already chalked ou .

Why should we consider that Aden is lost ? We know wherei.;^^ it has gone to ; we know where to iind it. We may not have the power' to recover it back, but why cry and weep over it ? They have got the power to take it, and they have taken it. 1 heard, Sir, a whisper in some quarters that we practically created this Settlement ; as a matter of fact, we have fed it, we have nursed it and brought it to its present pros perous state. Therefore, it is urged in certain quarters that even if the thing is taken away from ns, we are entitled to some sort of compensa tion. I will advise my friends on this side of the House not to say a word about it. Bargaining with a powerful opponent is always a losing game. Even if there is any offer made, please be careful. That offer would be more or less like the offer of a stingy aunt who asked her little nephew : Auntie : “ Well, John, will you let me kiss you if I give you a penny ? ” John : “ What only a penny ? Why, I get more than that for taking castor oil.” Therefore, be careful. If any kiss of that kind even on a payment is offered, you will ultimately find that it is not so very delicious. The best thing is to take a philosophic view of the whole matter and to sub mit to the will of the powerful and the mighty. But if you ask our honest opinion, I say you have no right to take Aden away, you have no right to touch it. By the usual nibbling process and by instalments you have done us out of it and now when you say : “ Please discuss tlie matter and send us your final opinion ”, don’t we know what you are going to do ? Thanks, we understand the game. We don’t want halt measure : either take the whole or give the whole. Major Nawab Ahmad Nawaz Khan (Nominated Non-Official) : Sir, the great war has brought about numerous changes in every country, and it is well known that Aden was primarily taken under British pos session for strategic purposes. After the war, on account of the numei- ous changes that have taken place all over the world, it has been found necessary now, not only for the sake of India, but for the sake of other countries as well, to separate Aden from India and to transfer it to the control of the Colonial Office. If Aden had been taken merely for the sake of trade and commerce for the Bombay Presidency, then all the objections urged by Honourable Members would have been perfectly justifiable, but it is well known that originally Aden was taken foi military and political purposes, and for the safety and protection o India ; but, after the Avar, things have so much changed that Aden is noAv required for the same purpose for other countries II Ho 8J71 toikBibk Mr. B.

I am u • going to say a little bit further to my Mussalman friends, that we must murk: have sympathy with the interests of Arabs there. Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad : Since the Honourable Member has referred sS}OU;. specially to the interest of Arabs, may I mention that the Arabs of Aden do not want separation from India ? I have got a resolution in my et iok fc po( t ket which I could not read out because I understand that there was a time limit of 15 minutes. :o very ( Major Nawab Ahmad Nawaz Khan : I have the same authority from the Arabs who say that Aden ought to be separated from India. I tell you, it is in the Bible and w e see also in practical life, that one man can not serve two masters. The Arabs cannot serve two masters, the British and the Indians. They must serve the British master and they want not to be under the Indians. (At this stage, Mr. B. Das rose in his seat.) Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) : The Honourable Member has listened to the expression of opinion on this side of the House very patientlv and it must give a patient hearing to the other side. Major Nawab Ahmad Nawaz Khan : If Aden is separated, the Arabs 5 PM will have a belter chance for their trade, commerce ccoiint’ and other things. I have a great sympathy for the Id,itl® Msses which the people of Bombay and other Indians have to suffer, but forties^ y°u cannot avoid it. We patiently suffer sometimes the losses which io trk occur when there is an earthquake, and, in order to satisfy ourselves, let as consider it as a political earthquake which has separated Aden from ^ ^ n aia. We cannot keep Aden wdth India and sacrifice the Imperial in- luye tk j^ re sts of the British Empire for the sake of commerce of the people of fifiik ^bay or the money which the Government of India spent there. By pfi r Hie separation of Aden, the Government of India or the British Govern- .jjfijtk aiaiff do not feel any pleasure, nor they do it merely to tease the Indians or to bring some losses on the people of Bombay. They have to consider primely the Imperial interests and the interests of many other countries which is a far more important matter, and they have to look at the thing A° m ^at point of view. Our mistake is that we see our side only am ;o f;,.v . 0 not see the other side. If we see the other side also, then we shall be ln a real position to jud^e properly. If Aden is separated from India, L298LAD ^ * r1738 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. [16th Sept. 1933, liiitirj [Major Nawab Ahmad Nawaz Khan.] we will have the advantage o! an addition of Rs. 24 lakhs on account of salt duty, in addition to Rs. 20 lakhs stated in the Government com munique, because at present Aden salt is treated as Indian salt and n Aden is separated, the Aden salt will be taxed as foreign salt. I admit, by the separation of Aden there would be losses to some people m Bombay, but that loss is inevitable. The Government here or the Home Govern- ment cannot avoid these things, and we will have to bear gladly all these losses. I have a better experience than other Honourable Members here, because my province is a province which is called the frontier province. There we have to sacrifice, many of these things for the sake of administra tion, political and military matters. So, I can realise better the position of the Government than people coming from far off provinces wheie tMmj enjoy a life of peace, pleasure and happiness. I respect the Honourab Members who are hundred ti nes abler than myself, and aie more a read,, but it is a question of experience.

V. Jadhav : Now I have to point out that, according to the figures which have been supplied, the civil expenditure and income ht-p th 1 e q » e 1 X So nd i tUre WaS Rs ' 12 ’ 45 &gt; 500 a »d the income was Rs. 10,27,558. In 1931-32, the income was Rs. 12.04,100 and the expenditure was Rs. 11,39,000 ; so there is a small profit’ In 1932 33 the revised estimates show an income of Rs. 13,64,000 and an expenditure of Rs. 11,01,700 ; so there is a profit of considerably over two lakhs So if these two lakhs are deducted from the amount of 16 lakhs the net charge which the Government of India have to bear comes to about 14 lakhs. Further, we have to take into consideration that the trade of Aden is in the hands of the principal merchants of Bombay and Calcutta and as their head offices are in those cities, they have been paying income- tax on the profits they make in the Settlement of Aden, at their head offices. If that is computed, the loss to Government, if Aden is trans ferred, will be about four lakhs. So, if that amount of four lakhs be again deducted from the amount of 14 lakhs, then the loss will be only 10 lakhs. Therefore, the bait offered to the people of India and the Government of India of a saving of 20 lakhs comes down, on further examination, to about 10 lakhs. At the same time, I have to point out here that the royalty ou salt imported from Aden at the rate of eight amias per ton on about 2,80,000 to three lakh tons annually amounting to Rs. 1,50,000 payable to Government is not shown in the answer given there. In the details of income, the income from salt' has been shown at Rs. 1,01,000, but I think this is the amount which the inhabitants of Aden have to pay on account of the salt consumed and I am not certain under what item this amount of royalty is included. Then there is the amount of ground rent payable by salt works to the Government of India amounting to Rs. 25,000 approximately annually, and there is also another item which I do not find in the details given, and that is that the salt works have also to pay a toll tax at two annas per ton of salt exported, amounting annually to roughly Rs. 38,000. Then the salt works have to pay a house and property tax of about Rs. 75,000, and so on. So the administration of Aden at present is not so expensive as it was previously, and, as we have seen, the military expenditure also is being reduced year by year. The ftroplanes have come to stay and the expenditure on garrisons has been 'onsiderably reduced both in Mesopotamia and in Aden. * - A *■ ' •?. A;- v . . &gt; •• ■ t-i; A Then, Sir, this was the inducement or bait offered to Indians in respect the transfer of Aden from India to the Colonial Office.

Now Sir arrangements are being made to separate Burma, and what is the ground advanced in justification of this action ? It is said that the neonle of Burma desire to have separation from India ; but this is not quite correct. No doubt, there is a section of the Burmese people pikpm who want separation of Burma and to have dominion status for Burma, and thouo-h that section is in a minority, it is a very strong minority., ^jitiee is sw But the majority is against separation. But, m the case of Aden, the same itepnee ^ principle of self-determination is not applied. If the people of Aden are Start'Brit consulted. I am sure, a very large majority will be in favour of remaining .fe f o#lie done with the Government of India. They have expressed their will in puhhc ^jr condition meetings and in every possible way they could. The other day the Honour able the Leader of the House flung in our face a representation by certain { Somali traders in Aden, but somebody has whispered to us that those traders are only 30 in number, and they were not even permanent residents of Aden. ^ lor his infer Sir, Aden has a population of 53,000, and it consists of Arabs, Jews . and Indians, both Hindus and Mussalmans, who have made their homes there and who are the real residents of Aden, and, therefore, it is their ■ voice which must prevail and which ought to be respected. Of course, there are certain people who are casual visitors for the purposes of carrying on trade. I do not mean to suggest that they cannot have any voice in the ;|| matter, but at all events the voice of the permanent residents of Aden ought to prevail, because they have got everything at stake there, while the ^ ^ others are mere birds of passage who merely go to Aden, remain there for ‘ 1 a time for the purpose of trade and, as soon as their pile is made, leave the ..V. ^‘ re ' place, and as such they cannot have as much interest in the Settlement as ' &lt;J the permanent residents -who have settled there for years. HI Jadhav Sir, the Settlement' of Aden had been for nearly a 100 years with the Government of Bombay, and the merchants of Bombay have made AdenFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN.

They have their vast godowns, their wharves their Lldiugs and their salt pans and everything that makes Aden what it is indav is due to the exertions and sacrifices which the Bombay merchants have made. Sir, a public meeting was held the other day at Aden of all L citizens of the place including Arabs, Jews and Indians, and they fitronffly protested against Aden being transferred to the Colonial Gov- Jrnmcnt and they strongly expressed a desire to remain with the Govern ment 0 f ’India, as they have been for nearly a century, and they appealed hotli to the Government of India and to the people of India not to f or ,sake them, and, above all, they strongly resented being handed over to the Colonial Office which is so notorious for its anti-Asiatic policy. They further pointed out that the Settlement of Aden had prospered under the government of India, and the civil administration was not a burden on India but it was self-supporting, and the Settlement promises to be more osp’erous was also in the interest of Indian trade and commerce. They pointed out the miserable condition of the neighbouring Somaliland uorts of Barbara, etc., which were transferred to the Colonial Office, and this condition they attribute to the anti-Asiatic policy of the Colonial Administration. Sir, this is the opinion of the people of Aden, and I think, if a plebiscite were to be taken, it would be preponderating in favour of remaining with India. An Honourable Member the other day, while speaking on this ques tion said that the transfer was in favour of the Arabs there. The Arabs, Jews and other communities, which make the total population of Aden, are eniovino’ equal rights. There is no discrimination under the rules of the Government of India, but the people of Aden, as well as the people of India know that as soon as Aden is transferred to the Colonial Administra tion in spite of the promises made in this communique that discrimina tion’will not be made, there is genuine apprehension in the minds of the people that injustice is sure to be done to the people of Aden. \\ e know from bitter experience what value to attach to these promises. The Colonial Office and the British Government often times made large promises that justice would be done to the Indians in South Africa but we know, Sir. what their condition is. The Indians m Kenya and other Settle ments The Honourable Sir Joseph Shore (Member for ^Commerce and Railways) : I do not want to interrupt my Honourable iriend, but, si t the matter has been referred to by more than one Member I would like to state for his information that the figures I gave, namely, were the figures of the Arab population of Aden. Mr. B. V.

Although these assurances were given that it , 3; ^ if we ca] was not the intention of the Government to transfer the control of Aden, ;m feto ” I now understand that the Government of Great Britain has become alive to the necessity of the transfer and the reason they give is this : “ The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India pt lose fiff® 108, under the new constitution are that it is an area geographically remote from India; ... a ; (he rate that it would not naturally fit into the new federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control.” Now, Sir, the chief reason given is that Aden is geographically :::fe Kra0 ' ;e ^ r remote from India. It has been geographically remote for the last 100 kW ®® 0 years and this point, that it will not fit into the new Federal Scheme, surprises mo. We have in this vast country of India French Settlements (. 5 f t Jadhav: at Pondicherry, at Chandernagore and at Mahe, and France, as is well known, is a republic. These Settlements fit into the administration of .. France and their representatives sit in the House of Deputies there. : ® !urd lSiJ Portugal has also some settlements on the West Coast of India. There is G oa, Din and Daman. In the old Constitution, it was a monarchy y, 7 Jadhav: and, under the new Constitution, it is a republic. Still these possessions “in,(heamount fit into the administration of the republic. Is it so very difficult, is it v.-jur aMatioi so much impossible to find out a scheme under which Aden can he namstbesoi fitted into the scheme of the Federation. I ask, whether the statesman- ^ ^ ship of England is so very bankrupt that they cannot find out any other v way than to separate Aden and put it under the colonial form of Gov- ‘ c . , eminent ? This Federation is no insuperable difficulty. Other nations - . have solved such a difficulty. The possessions of France and Portugal are more than 5,000 miles away. Aden is only 1,500 miles and the ■ lll(t distance, owing to aeroplanes and other things', has been dwindling very perceptibly every year. So, this excuse about Federation is not a very sound one. I shall now refer briefly to the history of Aden and how it came tindei the administration of India. It is well known that from time 5 ^FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADBN. r .x iiS im &amp;oveajtj;' ( : ’etniifflt, 1 ’ of savin? were ^ unliasW give is tv aain UsJ f •ly wots fcsf : it is allK!|; prartice fmj atrol” ) veiy®! iel Afe*| ether the )t:— olonial fott ,: ulty.

They had trading ihterests ? uc ! p ers ian Gulf and in Arabia and the Government of India thought 111 1 'if wou ^ -^e a very great advantage to have the possession of Aden Veh was a very important strategic position. So, the troops of 'India and the money of India achieved the conquest 12 Noon. 0 £ ^den. Ever since the year 1839—94 years ago— Arl has been under the Indian rule. Ever since that time, India had Wn sending the military forces there. The expenditure incurred by T De r nT1 account from the year 1839 has been variously computed. Wording to Sir Denys Bray and Mr. E. M. Cook, the Secretary who ivc these figures in 1921, it is computed that from 1839 to 1921—a g • d of g 2 years—India has paid at the rate of about 50 lakhs annually. Cm the year 1921 to 1927—a period of six years, according to the Lures given in 1927 by the Commander-in-Chief, the expenditure amounted to about 35 lakhs a year. From 1927 to 1932-a period of five vears the expenditure amounted to at the rate of Rs. 20 lakhs nrmrnllv ’ So if we capitalise the amount of money spent year after vear according to this scale, it amounts to the enormous amount of 758 cr ores and 16 lakhs at the rate of 4| per cent. The figures_given by fte Welbv Commission in the year 1900 are very very moderate. I all «-ive‘ those figures.

The tribes that surround Aden are pitoaecnmulate not very powerful tribes and a powerful garrison is not necessary. But, ateealenlate h as Aden stands on the trade route of the whole Empire, it has become amnally &lt; a place of very great strategic importance. Therefore the interests of ailatt at con the Empire as a whole requires that Aden should be adequately garri- caldatio soned and protected. For that purpose a very heavy force has been Bot I d 'stationed there from the very beginning. As a matter of fact, the fithenarket. military protection of that place ought to be a charge on the Imperial lit the matter Government. By the promise that has been held out to the people of isaie, Ithini Aden that after the transfer of Government, the Government of Great : ft trade vet Britain will undertake the 20 lakhs of expenses required for the military -$ir,there- proteotion of the settlement itself shows that Great Britain admits that Ail dote the charge is legitimately hers and it has been laid on the shoulders of nk to thee India rather unjustly.

Several British officers have made promises at various times that Aden will not be transferred. The population of Aden is not going to accept a transfer and they have unequivocally shown, at least a majority of them, .that they are in favour of remaining under the Government of India. The Indian people also are not very anxious to get rid of Aden. They want Aden. They want to assist their own merchants in Aden and also in East Africa and Somaliland in their trade. India has great cotton piece-goods and wheat and rice and jawar and other food grains for which she wants a market outside. Therefore, it is in the interest of India and Indian trade that Aden should be retained although it may be a burden on the resources of India. But India is willing to bear this burden and, therefore, I recommend that this House should unanimously declare its decision that Aden should be retained under the control of the Government of India. The Honourable Sir George Schuster : Sir, I think it would be well to intervene at this stage to say something on the general financial aspect of this question. Very full details Of recent expenditure and revenue of Aden were provided in answer to a question asked in the other House hr the Honourable Mr. V. V. Kalikar on the 29th August and my Honour able friend, who has just spoken, referred to that information. I think, in order to see this question in its proper perspective, it is just as well to say something of the past history. I am afraid, I cannot, however, if I go hack into the past history, meet my Honourable friend on the ground which he himself has chosen, a ground which leads him _ to calculate the value of the cost of the investment in Aden in whffi I think I pan fairly describe as astronomical figures. I am totally unable to find out how my Honourable friend made his calculations, or on what they were based. But I do suggest for the consideration of this House that it is not very profitable to attempt to calculate the value of Aden bv going back a hundred years and then adding up the expenditure and allowing it to accumulate at compound interest. If my Honourable friend likes to calculate his own value, that is to say, the cost whien nas. been expended annually on his maintenance, education, etc., and allows that to accumulate at compound interest, I should imagine tha , on i own methods of calculation, he would find himself to be worth something like five crores. But I doubt if my Honourable friend would command that price in the market, I think also it is fair to point on &gt; w en ., are looking at the matter in that way, that there is something to be ^ai on the other side. I think every one who lives in India recognises i . value of India’s trade very largely depends on the existence o e . navy.

I suppose £72, 00 rC^e^ns&amp;eTaWy SiTl find that in 1926-27 the actual cost of military expenditure borne by India was no less than dll lakhs. That was the position when the arrangement was made that His Majesty s Government should become responsible for the whole PO^l “d military expenditure of Aden. As from the 1st April, 1927, His Majesty s Government became responsible for the whole of that expenditure, but the arrangement was that the Government of India should contribute £250.000 a year for three years and then £150,000 a year or o^e-thir of the actual cost whichever was the less. I think it is important o call attention to that past history because, owing to the fact that Mi -..r • . i /w 4- + Q Vrvn rvrroT* nlvPfldv A TTiaiOr Uai’t 01 tUS ibtp * 1 ^friend J'Hifw take -eaiid w lis, Ido Tkrefoi jiliKirecan eoi: •..^Vraibers m igsirplus sfioii iglKi?ry lard to st If we can i Ur, so far ve h tiiijrat is ak IsKii'tle civi k , Sir, it Hon pay are not btail of Stati call attention to that past nistory oecause, uwn^ tu ^ — 7 e ' z Majestv’s Government have taken over already a major pait of responsibility for Aden, the taxpayer in India is being saved a very P.u 4-1 4. T+ lo V&gt;rv(- -mprplv A nnpstion ot 10 or ia responsibility for Aden, the taxpayer m mnia is a substantial amount indeed. It is not merely a question of 10 or lakhs, but actually in 1926-27 we were spending 47 lakhs a y^r on Aden. The position now is that we have reached the second jdage ot thai arrangement and our contribution is, as I have just said, £150,000 a year or one-third of the cost whichever is the less. And, as my Honourable friend, who has just spoken, pointed out, we paid the full £150,000 m 1930-31. In 1931-32, w^e paid £136,000 odd and in 1932-33, we have paid just under £120,000. I interrupted my Honourable friend to poia out that the last figure was not yet,the final figure, but I have no reason to suppose Ghat that figure will be substantially altered. So we may take it that our liability now. is in the neighbourhood of £ 120 , 000 , but it 'd copy of li jvoffte i tli jfcl pa is n T I is tin ;ii 5 receipts vh Mie friend sformcoi ^ mijlt a Nil SH ca ^intlief, ^e s-i'- MSI .T'is-r. hi 61.

That is our eontribiltioh to the military expenditure. The reduction which has been effected since 1930-31 has been brought about, as my Honourable friend pointed out because His Majesty’s Government are experimenting on a fairly large scale in the substitution of air force defence for land forces at Aden Possibly they may reduce the expenditure still further, but we have no information pn that point ; and I think it is important that the House should bear in mind that our liability at present may go up to £150 000 in any one year. Then we have to consider what has to be set against that as regards the balance of the revenue and expenditure on the account of the civil Government for which we are at present responsible. My Honourable friend pointed out that in the year 1932-33 there actually was a small surplus on account of Aden, a surplus of about lakhs. But if we take a broader view of the situation and take the average figures for a period of years, for instance if I go back to the year 1927-28 and take the average figures for seven years including the budget estimates of the current year, I find that there is actually a small debit balance on the average of about Rs. 66,000 annually. I do not think we can take the surplus of 1932-33 as a reliable figure, because, at present, as Honourable Members know, we have imposed very severe cuts on expenditure and we were able in the case of Aden to make some special economies. I do not think we can count on being able to maintain that position. Therefore, if one tries to put a fair picture before this House I think the fairest thing to do is to say that as regards the civil expenditure we can count on revenue and expenditure about balancing. Honourable Members must remember that, if there was a regular surplus, we should certainly have very urgent claims from the Resident at Aden that that surplus should be expended for the benefit of Aden, and it would be very hard to resist those claims, because there are very urgent works which they have been pressing for several years. I do not think, therefore, that we can maintain the position better than an even balance. Therefore, so far we have got this. We save the military contribution which at present is about £ 120.000 a year and may amount to £150,000 ; and as regards the civil expenditure we hand over an even balance. Now, Sir, my Honourable friend has referred to certain other items which he says are not included in the full statement that was provided in the Council of State. I find it rather difficult to follow exactly what my Honourable friend had in mind, but as soon as possible I will get a shorthand copy of his speech and verify what he has said. I do not think that any of the items to which he referred would in any case have appreciably affected the position, and I think that the statement which I have just given is really substantially correct. But there is one item to which he referred which I think one must put before this House. n calculating what is the revenue of Aden, we have included the annua income-tax receipts which come in under the heading of Aden. u . as my Honourable friend pointed out, there may be merchants who in a re their returns for income-tax in India and who include in those re urn profits which might after separation become liable ^tp income-ax Aden ; and in that case of course, under our provisions or mi income-tax relief. w T e should have to lose part of that income-ax. quite impossible to give any reliable estimate as to wha ,l a . iv' might he ; 1 do not think myself that it could be a very substantial gu0 ,1782 legislative assembly.

So that class of assets goes out ; the Government of India cannot make any claim under that head. I M&amp;, I 1 ijhiiffr. I do not ■- 1 ® riy sai this, non' by iilitiwts tha' Then as to the question of buildings, as regards Provincial Govern- ment buildings, we had, as a matter of fact, quite recently gone into that particular question when the administration of Aden was taken over L the Government of India from the Government of Bombay. A claim was made by the Government of Bombay and figures were gone into, and it was ascertained that the cost of the buildings amounted to something like nine lakhs, but we resisted that claim in the Government of India, because we said that we had already m other cases adopted the principle that when responsibility in administration m any sphere passes from one authority to another, the assets and liabilities connected with the ordinary administration should also pass free of payment. That is the sort of principle on which discussions as regards the separation of burn 13 ! for example, have always been based, and I think perhaps my fmen s are inclined to take what is a misleading view of the situation in considering the possibility of making claims on account of assets o that kind. They are really' part of the ordinary equipment of Govern ment ; they have been provided out of revenue, and they have to ^ maintained out of revenue, but, ordinarily speaking, when an adminis tration is handed over, it is not so much an asset as a liability, or at leas ono must take into account the fact that there is a liability as ivell, an we certainly have always taken the line in the Government of India tha any claim based on account of the cost of buildings, which, as I say, are j wt the r&lt; ««e,wlKuFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN, loixvAilUJN UF ADEN, 1/783 ' *: ditm 5i || 0 ^xadlyj id it is iip ■ d get aij eBNs I?

Therefore, we resisted the claim of the Bombay Government to that nine lakhs, and we have maintained that position. Apart from provincial buildings, there are a few Central Govern ment buildings—I have not got any details of their cost,—but their cost would be negligible. Then of course, there is the question of military buildings, and here I must point out that when the control of the military administration was taken over by His Majesty’s Government in 1927, ail military build ings were transferred to His Majesty’s Government, free of cost, on the basis of the principle which I have just explained,—the principle being, as I said, that they cannot be assessed at a commercial value, that they carry liabilities with them, and in this case of course the transfer of the military responsibility carried with it a very heavy liability which at the time of the transfer amounted to nearly 50 lakhs per annum. That, Sir, is the position as regards these liabilities. There is only one other class of assets, and that is the Water Works, and there, according to the information which I have got, about three' lakhs was spent on an aqueduct, and about 5| lakhs was spent on water tanks. This expenditure was undertaken a very long time ago. The information which I am giving was taken from the Imperial Gazetteer of 1908, and apparently that expenditure was undertaken as a grant to the Municipal Committee. That, Sir, I think, covers what we call all the assets which are to be taken over. I do not think that I have got anything further to add, but I can only say this, that if any other points are made, such as have been made just now by my friend from Bombay, we will most carefully check all statements that the Honourable Members make. If they want themselves to get the results of our investigations from checking these statements, I should be very pleased to forward them to them, and if we find that we have been wrong in our figures, we wull certainly take that into account in considering the matter on behalf of the Government of India after this debate, and we will see that correct information is forwarded to His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh (Muzaffarpur cum Champaran : Non-Muham madan) : Sir, I am thankful to the Government for giving us an oppor tunity of discussing this important question. I also recognise with appre ciation the decision of the Government to observe an attitude of neutrality, and to confine the discussion only amongst non-official Members of this House. My friend, Mr. Anklesaria, in the course of his speech, said that he was looking for guidance and advice from Government. Sir, my friend is accustomed to look for guidance and advice from the occupants of the Treasury Benches, but those of us, who sit on this side of the House, claim to judge every question on its own merits, and come to a decision irrespective of what the views of the Government Members may be. Sir. as Honourable Members are aware, Aden was captured in 1819 by Major Baillie, who was sent out on behalf of the Government of Bom bay. Even before that time, Indians were in Aden under the Sultanate of Lehaj ; and, since the acquisition of Aden on behalf of the Govern ment of India, it remained under the Government of Bombay, and all1784 n legislative assembly. - ; [ 18 th Sept. 1933.

What was then, Sir, a mere barren rock at the time oi its capture was converted in course of time, by Indian labour, Indian capital and Indian industry into a flourishing port of first rate strategic and commer cial iiunortanee a first rate harbour and a distributing trade centre. Sir, ouestion of the transfer of Aden had been loomimg large on the hori zon since the year 1921, if not before. On the 28th of February, 1921, the Prime Minister of England stated in the House of Commons, that the responsibility for administration and policy in Palestine, Mesopotamia and Aden was to be transferred to the Colonial Office ; and then, later on, the RiMit Honourable Mr. Winston Churchill, speaking m the House of Com mons on the 14th July, 1921, made the following statement. I shall read out only one paragraph from his statement, as giving an indication of the working of the mind of the Cabinet in England, and the motive which prompted them to arrive at this decision. This is what he said : “ There is another possibility of a reduction of expenditure in Aden. The India Office has very kindly handed over Aden to the Colonial Office, and my acceptance of —please mark the words carefully— ‘ ‘ the India Office has very kindly handed over Aden to the Colonial Office, and my acceptance of the gift has only been delayed by the financial negotiations because India has hitherto played a great part, and I certainly should not be serving the interests of the British taxpayer if I assumed the whole burden without any of the funds which are necessary to maintain a fortress of first consequence to India ” Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad : Will you please read it out again, I mean the portion relating to the gift— it is a very important point. Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh : “ There is another possibility of a reduction of expenditure in Aden. The India Office has very kindly handed over Aden to the Colonial Office, and my acceptance of the gift has only been delayed by the financial negotiations because India has hitherto played a great part, and I certainly should not be serving the interests of the British tax payer if I assumed the whole burden without any of the funds which are necessary to main tain a fortress of first consequence to India, but I hope for a happy solution. In fact, I think in a very few days we shall have reached an agreement and the moment that Aden is transferred to the Colonial Office, it will be possible to amalgamate the administration of Aden and Somaliland. Somaliland and Aden are really the most happy marriage that could be made. They are really necessary to one another. The high ground, five or six thousand feet high in Somaliland, will afford a Hill station to which the British soldiers in Aden under the most trying conditions all through summer could go company by company, in night’s journey across the sea to Somaliland. You could not have a more harmonious minor proposition, and if this amalgamation be carried out in such a way as to effect perhaps, a saving of £200,000 to £300,000 a year in the reduction of military expenditure, it will repay the trouble which it takes to arrive at such a conclusion. ’ ’ This is what Mr. Winston Churchill said in the House of Commons on the 14th July, 1921. . The ^' ^ ain &gt; on t he ^ 6 th September, 1921, the Honourable Sir Phiroze aeihna moved a Resolution in the other place which stated that the administration of Aden be continued under the Government of India and not be transferred to the Colonial Office. Speaking on that occasion, ie lonourable Mr. Pratt, who was then, I believe, the official representa- rve o e Government of Bombay in that House, stated as follows : the Govern-mft'ni^ r ^ ns | er ^ Aden to the Colonial Office is a question in which attitude of the BGmh Q m * S r ee l ) ] y ancl clos ely interested.

'Their position is* that the/ have had very little notice and indeed very little time for the consideration of this: : : ^ question. They have had very little information as to the grounds on which the transfer is being considered. It is also a fact that public opinion both in Bombay and Aden has expressed itself very strongly against the proposed transfer. Very strong protests have been recorded by the trading communities of Bombay and Aden and for these reasons for the present the Government of Bombay objects to any change in the status quo.” V ■ In this connection I should like to remind my Honourable friend, the Nominated Member .from the North-West Frontier Province, who claimed to speak on behalf of the Arab population of Aden and said that the Arabs in Aden did not object to this transfer, of what the Honourable Sir Muhammad Shafi said on behalf of the Government of India. He ■* admitted in so many words that the people of India as well as the Arab people, in Aden were opposed to the proposed transfer. [At this stas^e, Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) vacated the Chair which was then occupied by Mr. Deputy Presi dent (Mr. Abdul Matin Chaudhury).] Sir Muhammad Shah said : “ I can assure the House that the Government of India will take note of the opinions expressed in this House by various members representing different m eres • . * will note the fact that Indian Sentiment according to the various spea ers x ® . .

They will also take note of the fact, which has een P • stated by the Honourable Mr. Sethna and is endorsed by the Bombay Government t local opinion in Aden as well as in Bombay is also opposed to the transfer.

It is also stated that Aden is al ready to some extent under the Imperial control, and so we should not object to the transfer of the civil control of the Settlement. This step was taken in the midst of the Great War, and only as a temporary mea sure. And, now, we are to be deprived of the remnant of control over the civil administration of Aden which we were having all these years. Some of us recognised at that very time that the partial transfer of the control of Aden to the British Government was only the thin end of the wedge, and it has now come to be true. It is stated in the communique that India would be relieved of the annual contribution of approximately 20 lakhs at present payable towards the military and political administration. Sir. I am thankful to the Honourable the Finance Member for having given us a full account of the financial position of Aden, and its implications in the consideration of the question. I do not want to speak with regard to that point, but I vrould like to say very clearly that in this calculation the income which the Government of India has been deriving from salt duty, income-tax and super-tax has also to be taken into account. I am speaking subject to correction by the Honourable the Finance Member that the revenue which is being derived by India from these and other sources amounts to something like 10 lakhs of rupees. If this is so, then out of 20 lakhs we shall be losing 10 lakhs of revenues if the civil administration of Aden is taken out of our control. The Honourable Sir George Schuster : I think my Honourable fiiend is definitely incorrect. We have included in the revenue statemen all the income-tax receipts from Aden. As I explained, there is only °^ e small marginal receipt from incomeetax we might lose, that is to say, o the extent we now get income-tax from business men assessed m India m respect of profits made in Aden. To that extent we may find t ia v~ lose a little income-tax, but it will be quite a small sum. Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh : I am glad to stand corrected. However that may be, this 20 lakhs is not much when considering e p , Aden with regard to the future constitution of India, as i ° as the Gibraltar of the East. TT Ks v .

Sir, this stipulation is not worth the paper _ which it is printed. We know the condition of our countrymen nn the Colonial Office. We know how Indians are being treated m Sou Africa, in Kenya, in Fiji, in Mauritius and in so many other place overseas inspite of the assurances of the Government. Myself, as well other Honourable Members, have been responsible for bringing to notice of this House the conditions of our fellow countrymen oversea from time to time, and the racial and other kinds of discriminate ^ which has been imposed upon them in the exercise of their political a 5 well as economic rights in the colonies in which they have settled. Iff not pin much faith in the assurance that the imposition of any additima taxation will not be undertaken unless such a course became absolu necessary. I take it, whenever additional taxation is imposed, h assumed that such a course is necessary, so the value of this stipulatio is nothing. Only tomorrow fresh taxation might be imposed upon Aden, and it may be pleaded in justification that such a course was necessary* It is again stated in the communique that the proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden for som years after the transfer takes place. It is to be noted that it is only a proportion of the Indian service) administrative personnel and not e whole personnel which will be retained, and that also for some years only after which the Indian personnel will verv likelv be eliminated altoget e frOni the service in the Aden administration. £&gt;:i ' ' &lt;jAJ&amp;asJ H Words 1 in It86 «i .m?* h ‘'81] FUTURE ADMINIS'ERaTION OF ADEN. interetsi;: tlie rigttil alsosWi licydlifai I •eepori, Hi k preaa freeptl try or if It mini® ■edbytt^ ar, aitl S’ neet tfe ® rts tterfife Now, the last point which has been urged in the communique isHhat no racial discrimination or segregation would be permitted by.

Since this question has been actively discussed in the country, the evidence has been so great that I would only be surprised if the Government ignore them and have their own way of dealing with this question. I have corres pondence with so many people both in Aden as well as in India that I can undoubtedly say that the: feeling is genuine, it is by no means engineered. ' The feeling is that the conditions of Indians as well as the Adenese will be much worse when they go to the Colonial Office. The feeling has gained ground and I do not believe any amount of argument on the part of British Government could remove those feelings from their minds. If a genuine man could give any advice to the Government on this question, it will be not to disturb the minds of Indians and Adenese at such a moment on such a vital question. They should remember that it is sentiment which plays a great part in such questions rather than financial considerations which the Honourable the Finance Member has chosen to put before the House. On the question of finance, many Honourable Members who are of better health than I am will be able to reply, but I know there is very little in that question.

I think it is a very ' honest communique, which gives plain warnings (Laughter and Cheers) ids. If if and I shall now try to convince my Honourable friends sitting on the Opposition Benches that it is so.

Then, Sir, coming to the fourth condition, His Majesty’s Government have sounded another warning that it will be necessary for them to im pose additional taxation on the people of Aden. His Majesty’s Govern ment are perfectly honest. They say that they will impose additional axation and they give us ample warming about it.

However, ydien 1 refer to the financial aspect on this motion, I should like to say H few words. - Turning now to the question of the Settlement of Aden, one thing cannot be gainsaid, that this Settlement had been won by Indian arms, that it had been developed by Indian labour, that it had been main tained by Indian enterprise, and that it had been sustained by Indian money. That cannot be gainsaid. All that was not the work of His Majesty’s Government. A barren rock across the bay was not converted into a prosperous Settlement in a day. It was the work of nearly a century attended with grave risks—-and that was the work of Indians in this country. Sir, for what end was all that done ? Was it done merely for the purpose of provuding a link in the Imperial chain of aggression ? No, Sir. The cautious Indian merchant, in his affluence, the groaning tax-payer of India, in his poverty, would not have contributed but for the assurances given by the then Government that Aden x x7 ould ever remain a part of the Indian Empire. This question of separation oi Aden from India was not' a question of yesterday or today. It has een a live question from the day when popular control was sought to he i 111 * 0 t* 16 Legislatures of this country.

May I respectfully ask, did His Majesty’s Government think that there was such a person as a taxpayer in this country whose burden had got to be relieved when crores and crores of rupees Avere being spent upon, what is called, the military expenditure in this country, an expenditure which is out of all proportion to the actual requirements of this country, and certainly out of all proportion to the capacity of this country to bear ? Where was this taxpayer then ? Why did they not think of the tax payer’s burden ? Why are they thinking of a feAv lakhs now ? Ike reason is not far to seek. A few years ago, Mr. Wedgwood Benn, ex- Secretary of State, admitted that the military expenditure that we liaa been incurring, and had been found charged upon the revenues o us country for the purpose of keeping a big army of this country, 1111 f? be, to some extent, a legitimate charge upon the Imperial revenues, wanted to give an assurance that the whole question would be exair W ’ and that only such portion as India could legitimately bear aa u - apportioned to her.

[18th Sept. 1933. [Mr. B. Sitaramaraju.] were not parties to it. We protested against it. It, is the Government that brought about this situation by separating it from Bombay and, having brought that about, they find fault with it. It is not fair. With all these autocratic Princes coming into the Federation, I do not know if the Federation is going to be a proper fit, but if Aden, being a non provincial unit, is a misfit in the Federation, the remedy is to restore Aden to the province of Bombay from which it has been taken. I am glad to note from the reply that the Secretary of State has given that the difficulty about Aden was not insurmountable. I do hope that the obstacle will soon be surmounted. One thing more and I have done. It is said that Aden is sp far away and remote from India. Why, in that case, I ask, should it be linked with the judicial administration of Bombay still ? That would go to show that the connection of Aden could not be separated altogether from Bombay, however much they may want it. Further, it will not pay them to do so. With these few remraks, I venture to submit that it is Ihe unani mous opinion not only of this House, but of the wdiole country that the administration of Aden, civil and military, should never be separated from India with which it has been connected so far. ^ r ‘ C. S. Ranga Iyer (Rohilkund and Kumaon Divisions : Non- Muhammadan Rural) : Sir, I had given notice of a motion which I do not propose to move, but which I certainly proposed to place on record, after hearing the speech of the previous speaker : .

It is provided even hi this communique of the Government that the Bombay High Court will be of use to Aden subjects even after the completion of the transfer. I think 1 am right in saying so, because I have not got the communique before me, and I am speaking from recollection. If that is so, and if distance does not come in the way in this particular respect, I canot see why civil control should not be in Bombay’s hands as it has been hitherto. I hope and trust that, in the constitutional adjustment, Aden will not be taken away from us so far as the civil affairs are concerned. leir creel planters in Kenj Lt Cut and there Dr. F. X. DeSouza (Nominated Non-Official) : Mr. Deputy Pre sident, with your permission, I should like to intervene for a few moments in this debate, because I am interested in Malabar and, to some extent, in the trade of the West Coast. You are aware that Aden is the dis tributing centre for a considerable portion of the produce of Malabar consisting of pepper, tobacco, spices, plantation products and timber. The trade in these articles is handled by Arab merchants who are financed by Indian bankers resident in Aden who allow them credit from three to six months at a time. They buy these articles in Malabar and carry them in Arab bottoms built at Aden out of Malabar timber and distribute them in Persia, Iraq, Arabia and the east coast of Africa. This trade has been roughly estimated to amount to something like half a crore. •ait ifintl to fte contr wmamof nip of the G tiitpmtite fiom idtroL' When it was announced by His Majesty’s Government that the control of Aden was to be transferred to the Colonial Office, consider able perturbation was caused in Malabar among traders as well as producers as to what w’as to happen to this trade. We all know that trade follows the flag, but it has been the unfortunate experience of Indian trade that it has never flourished under the Colonial Flag. On the contrary, whenever a Colonial Administration has taken charge or Indian trade, a blight seems to have overtaken that trade. You have only to look across the water and you will find that Somaliland, when it was administered by the Government of Bombay, had a flourishing trade and its seaports of Barbara, Zaila, Bulhar were thriving ports ; the port of Barbara had a population of 20,000 with busy docks, wharves ami warehouses. After the Somali war, the Government of that Colony was handed over to the Colonial Office and the result was that these ports are now practically dead. Indian merchants, unable to bear the heavy taxation and the discrimination against them made by the Colonial Ad- mimstiators, gradually left the Colony and in their wake followed the Jewish and the Arab merchants. For the same reasons, in Kenya, n t P F 1 ear ? ^ ie Indian wheat trade has been practically eliminated, 1 ia ' ie ndian transport trade has been suppressed and that attempts are being made to eliminate the Indian maize trade. The reason seems °,.-| e e Colonial Administrator does not understand the Indian ff 61 a F k now s the European trader and settler. He knows the native of the Colony which he is administering ; but the Indian ^0 er, an Asiatic who claims equality of opportunity with the European, f a F°i P a wFF. hl f P hi losophy. In the result, we find that whenever in a- ° omal Office has taken over the administration of territory where lans are settled, the trade of India suffers very severely.

Only the other day, I heard that there was a trade mission sent under the aegis of the Government of Kenya to Aden to negotiate an agreement for the sale of the plantation produce of Kenya. As it happened, the Indian bankers at Aden refused to give credit to the merchants and the English bankers also refused to give credit, because their credentials were not satisfactory. We all know that the planters in Kenya have very powerful connections and have friends at Court and there is no doubt that they will in a short time b e able to eliminate the Malabar produce from the Aden market if Aden is transferred to the control of the Colonial Office. This debate has been initiated by my Honourable friend, the .Leader of the House, with a motion that this House do take into consideratio the communique of the Government of India. The communique tains the following words : “Already Aden (Settlement) to some extent is t^P^eld^Hpa^eTwholly inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate which has already passed out of Indian control. ’ ’ If I understand these words rightly, they seem to imply that ^ ^ Settlement of Aden continues to remain under the control ^ eminent of India, there would be di vided c °n to a ^ bg m0gt which, in time of war, will be unworkable.

Then, again, it is idle to urge our moral claims to the reten tion of Aden, claims based upon Aden having been developed from a barren rock with a population of 3,000 to a flourishing port, the entrepot for the trade of the middle east, with a population of more than 50,000. It seems to be idle to urge our moral claims, because, if it is Imperial policy that dictates the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government, there is no answer. Salus patriae suprema lex. y l?iy Hod BfafeoM What then should this Assembly do ? Should we, as was said by my Honourable friend, Mr. Puri, whom I am sorry not to see here, fold our hands in silence and offer Satyagraha ; because, as he said, it is useless to try to bargain with an opponent with overwhelming strength ? Or shall we say, as my Honourable friend, Major Nawab Ahmad Nawaz Khan, suggested, that the people of Bombay and Karachi and the other ports affected should look upon this as a loss caused by an act of God, say by an earthquake ? Of course, it is very easy to preach resignation under other people’s misfortunes. But these seem to me to be counsels of despair. I do not think that that is an attitude of mind with which we should meet the situation. A similar situation on a vastly larger scale offered itself to the British Government in framing a scheme for the Federation of India. They had to hand over the immense trade of the British nation with India to the future Federal Government. Did they fold their hands and say : “We do not care what happens to this trade ; let it take care of itself ” ? No ; they insisted upon constitutional safeguards being inserted in the Constitu tion that no discrimination shall be allowed against British trade by the future Federal Government. I wish our Honourable friends, the Mem bers of the European Group, would help us and tell us how a similar guarantee may be inserted in the Instrument of Transfer, transferring the administration of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Government. It is true that there are certain vague promises which are offered in this communique. But, as pointed out by every speaker on the Opposition Benches as well as on these Benches, these are hedged round with so many “ ifs ” and so many “ ans ” that they are. certain to be treated as mere scraps of paper. [At this stage, Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) resumed the Chair. use to express ® of all Iwlii k Hr.

But whatever the compensation granted may be, I feel certain that there will be deep and sullen resentment in the mind of political India caused by the action proposed to be taken by His Majesty’s Govern ment. bir, at a time when every other country and every other nation is endeavouring to capture foreign markets by appointing Trade ComtlskJ of more k&gt; ise, if it bIe we, as«i ry not toi: Bombay anil is a loss® , it isw f FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN missioners and otherwise to develop the trade of their country, here we are asked to sacrifice a large market amounting to eight crores of rupees, at our very door, created by our enterprise. And while un employment is acute, wc are asked to sacrifice a not inconsiderable field for the employment of our nationals, not only in the service of Gov ernment, but also in mercantile houses. And, above all, we are asked the Indian population exchanges the whips of the Government of India for the scorpions of the Colonial Office there will be one more cry raised from Indians overseas and that cry will stir political India deeper than any other cry of a similar kind has stirred it before ; because, it will be a cry raised not from the descendants of indentured coolies as in South Africa or from segregated hawkers and shopkeepers as in Kenya and Tanganyika, but it will be a cry raised by powerful mercantile interests with influential connections in Karachi, Bombay, Rangoon and all the other important ports of India. And, therefore, in all humility, I ask His Majesty’s Government to pause before they decide to take the action they propose, and if the blow is inevitable, then, so far as lies in their power, to soften the blow. Sir Cowasji Jehangir : Sir, I rise to support, I believe it is a Resolu tion moved by my Honourable friend, Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad. I under stand, the intention of Government in allowing the non-official Members of this House to express their opinion is to enable Government to realise the feelings of all Indians on this question. I should have thought that by now, Mr. President, all Honourable Members on the opposite side had fully realised the strong feelings,—you may call it sentiment if you like or you may, if you like, call it bad argument combined with sentiment,—that exists throughout the country ; that the step now proposed by His Majesty’s Government, namely, the transfer of the civil administration of Aden to the Colonial Office is strongly resented. Sir, every one of us has been supplied with a considerable amount of literature. I have got it in front of me, and, I am sure, my friend, the Honourable the Leader of the House, must have got two copies each sent to him. (Laughter.) The Honourable Sir Joseph Bhore : Not even one. Sir Cowasji Jehangir : Then, Sir, may I present him with this bunch cf pamphlets on the question of the transfer of Aden,—and every one of these pamphlets protests against the proposed transfer. Sir, my friends who have already spoken have left very little for any one else to say, but the fact that, even after what little I shall have to say many more will rise to their feet, will, I trust, convince Honourable Members opposite, if they are not already convinced, that the proposed transfer of Aden has not got the approval of the people of this country. Now, Sir, the latest contribution that has been made to this subject is this communique. I think my friend, Mr. Munshi, from Burma was rather enamoured of this communique, and, lest anybody might mis understand him, he candidly said that it was one of the worst argu ments ever put forward by Government, but his sarcasm went to such L302LAD e ’V 1 lfe«re' LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.

T do not want to worry this House by reading again the words of the then Foreign Secretary uttered in the presence of the Viceroy to a deputation that waited on him in 1931, when he told the deputation t hat Government had no ulterior motives in making the transfer from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India, and that it was only a question of administration. Now, Sir, personally I did not really even then fully understand the great difficulty of administration. I had something to do with the administration of Aden for several Maflar?um i years, and although there was some delay on account of the Bombay Government having to get the approval of the Government of India in j^go so many of their proposals, it was not an insuperable difficulty. Such delays occur every day in the administration of this country. Pro- vineial Governments have to get the orders of the Government of India on many questions which cause delay and inconvenience, but it is no use crying over spilt milk. The transfer, was made, but we never expected that that transfer would be flung in our faces ^ K ^ as an argument in favour of again transferring the administration of .... ^V fre o “ o~~ ~ . j ill Aden to the Colonial Office. Sir, it is a poor argument to put forward after what fell from the lips of responsible officers of the Government ^ of India. Then, Sir, we are told that to some extent the control has already mat of passed into Imperial hands. Now, who agreed to that transfer? We iufeepo were never consulted. And what is much more, an undertaking was ti objecti given that we would be consulted. Mr. President, not even the Gov- auolii$ ernment of Bombay was consulted. Far from being consulted, they sliti®, fh beard of it for the first time when the Home Member for the Bombay iprtsnt Si Government was actually on his feet moving a Bill in the Legislative inJJTCJ FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 13 MS??A 3 711 aJ?T O-I.

His only answer was that all he could say was that the Government of India had approved of his moving the Bill, and he was not responsible. Now, Sir, if that is an argument for the trans- fpr of the civil administration to the Colonial Office, my answer is. re- vou will get rid. oi tms argument, n you nave caused a difficulty for yourself, then undo the wrong you have done already, but don’t bring it up as an argument at this stage, for it was your action and not ours, your action without our appio-val. Then, Sir, we come to this question of money. We are told that we shall be let off £150,000 a year, that is what it comes to. If I have under stood the Finance Member correctly, the budget of the civil adminis- to His Majesty’s Government will be saved if we agree to the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office. In these matters we do not look at all questions from the point of view of pound, shilling and pence. Suppose it does cost us £150,000, it is much less than what it cost us in 1926-27, which was Rs. 47 lakhs, and if against our will and against our wishes this burden was taken off our shoulders, it is no use now coming forward and telling us, “We will relieve you of a further burden of £150,000 ”. We did not pass any Resolution in the Imperial Legislative Council, or in the Legislative Assembly, or in the Council of State, asking for this relief. It was a relief given to us because it was convenient to somebody else. We did not ask for such reliefs. No. 2 is too absurd for words, that the right of appeal in judicial cases will remain with the Bombay High Court. Take it, for goodness’s sake, to the High Court in England. We do not want it. If you are to transfer Aden to the Colonial Office, I think the Government of Bombay would be justified in saying, “ We shall have nothing further to do with you aM we shall not have our High Court helping you to administer justice ”. It is a convenience to yourself ; it is not a convenience to us. Why put it down as an argument in favour of transferring Aden to the Colonial Office ? If it is put here as a bait to my friends in Aden that they won’t have to go so far to England for their justice, then they might reply “ We shall have to go 1,600 miles, as we do now, for our appeals. We shall all the same have to go 6,000 miles when we want justice in all other directions ”. It is said that Aden will remain a free port n it is transferred to the Colonial Office. Has it ever been contended that it would not be a free port if it remained under the administration o India? What is this ? Is this an assurance given, or is it meant to he said that if Aden remains with the Government of India it will no longer be a free port ? What is this assurance to us ? It is qualibed. My Honourable friend, the Leader of the House, can, without even consulting his colleagues, give exactly the same assurance^ om e a o the Government of India that if the status quo is maintained Aden will remain a free port so- far as it is possible, and I am sure a ^ icre would be no objection, without consulting even a . ^ in ^ e , on ? ,° -.p colleagues, to his giving us such an assurance and giving the^ _ e m that consolation.

Government do intend that no racial discrimination shall take place but I have my strong suspicions that Government will not be able to do 'it We have had bitter experience, Mr. President, What is the use of repeating those experiences over and over again here. They have been brought to the attention of Government, of the Colonial Office. Com missions have been appointed. People have had to go out to the colonies to investigate the injustice to our countrymen. Do we desire to add one more grievance to the many grievances that this country has with regard to the preferential treatment shown to others, as compared to Indians in the colonies ? Major Nawab Ahmad Nawaz Khan (Nominated Non-official) is a Persian proverb which says : “ Een ham bar sari alam. ” Sir Cowasji Jehangir : Translate it. If I am interrupted in Persian, I cannot reply. Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) : Reply in Gujerati, Sir Cowasji Jehangir : You will rule me out of order, Mr. President, if you find out the meaning of my Gujerati. (Laughter.) At any rate, Sir, we do not desire to take any further risks with regard to Aden, because a good percentage of the population of Aden are Indians and if after all anything went wrong and there was discrimination against Indians, I am afraid the trouble would assume a character which I do not like even to visualise. This bitterness between our two countries has increased greatly on account of the ill-treatment of Indians in some of the colonies. We do not want to add another cause of bitterness. Sir, we have heard a good deal about discrimination in India. Nobody wants to discriminate but we do ask those who ask us not to discriminate in India to help to see that there is no discrimination against Indians in the British Empire and if they cannot help us effectively, which they cannot with all the desire in the world, let them at least stand side by side with us in fighting, to see that we do not have another colony where there will be discrimination, a colony which has been administered by India. If there was discrimination in that colony 7 , it would never be for given in this country and for that reason alone it would be to the interests of both countries that Aden shall never be transferred to the Colonial Office. It is not discrimination against Indians in favour of ^English men. It is discrimination against Indians, because they are Asiatics, m favour of Europeans. The English population of Aden ^ is next to nothing. There are Frenchmen, Italians and Germans in Aden. Do1808 odf legislative assembly. [18th Sept. 1933.

It has already been Uo ° That is that if this transfer is inevitable, if as rumour has it, Tfs an ac^mplMred faet,-personally I do hope and trust it is notan accomplished fact,-then I do appeal to the Government of India to see thaMustice is done to the taxpayers of this country. I have just now said that Aden serves not only India but it has been of equal service to A iiitral ia and the Straits Settlements. We have paid out of our monies ; tele defence of Aden up to the year 1926. A contribution was paid by Great Britain. We shall still continue to pay a contribution, while a maior portion of the expenditure will be borne by the British exchequer but if Aden is transferred, then I think it is only justice and equity to ' the taxnavers of this country that the monies that we have spent out of Seir moimVfor the protection of Aden should be refunded to us, not with compound interest, but so far as can be ascertained with out any interest at all and ray main argument for that is, and I will repeat it that Aden is and has been maintained as a fortress not on l y for India but for the Empire as well and for certain parts of the Empire in particular and all should put their hands into their pockets. Why should India be called upon to contribute £150,000, even if the administration remains with India ? Why not Australia ? Why not Straits Settlements ? I would like that point to be considered by the Government of India. In any ease, whether it is left with the Govern ment of India or whether it is transferred to Great Britain, in both cases all parts of the Empire should contribute. WEy should England ^lone bear the burden ? W hy should England pay a contribution or why should we pay a contribution ? Are there no other parts of the Empire which are benefiting and are there no other parts of the Empire which are being protected ? Sir, I have nothing else to say except to reiterate that I do not think there is a single Honourable Member, an elected Member, of this House who is in favour of this transfer. I confidently say that not one elected Member is in. favour of the transfer, apd we do hope that the Government of India will convey to His Majesty’s Government the strong resentment that this country will feel if the transfer does take place. (Applause.) Sardar G. N. Mivjrandar (Gujrat and Deccan Sardars and Iniimdars : Landholders) : Sir, I rise to support the amendrneni moved By thy Honourable friend, Mr. Bhuput Sing.

Not only the people of Bombay, but also of India and even of Aden are strongly against this transfer. On the 13th September last, a big public meethi was held at Calcutta which unanimously protested against the transfer. It is a very sad thing that Aden is being snatched away from us after our very long and happy connection with her for about a century The people of Aden, comprising of Arabs, Jews and Indians, live in Aden together as brethren, and there has never been any sort of inequality of status, which state of things we prize the most. Even with regard to commerce, industry and employment, every one in Aden feels secured. The present prosperous condition of Aden is only due to the efforts of the Bombay Government and the people of Bombay and India, who went and established themselves there. The tax-payers of India in general and of Bombay in particular have annually contributed lakhs of rupees for a number of years to make it what it is today. I know very well of what great importance our connection has been with Aden and how, therefore, in the mutual interest of Aden and India, every endeavour has been made by Indians to make Aden a prosperous port and a market for our produce. Whenever any question came before our Legislature regarding the improvements at Aden, we have been most sympathetic and I must say we have all along felt that Aden was a part of our own. Aden is about 1,600 miles from Bombay, yet with the recent improved shipping, it has come nearer to us than many parts of India for the transport of our produce, and hence it is very valuable to us. Sir we felt very much when Aden -was transferred from Bombay to Delhi and Simla, but we felt safe on the assurance given by His Excellency the Viceroy to Sir Chunilal Mehta’s deputation in November, 1931. that the transfer would not cut off Aden from India and that our trade and commerce would be the special care of the Government of India. Sir on such an assurance, we, in the districts, did feel and still do feel that our Government will not let us down. To us this proposal of transfer has come as a surprise. It is really unthinkable, after so much sacrifice on our part, and when the Settlement of Aden has become prosperous, that our Government could be a party in Aden being taken away from us and that, too, against the desire of the people. I am sure, Sir. our Government will respect the feelings of the people and will also take into consideration our sacrifices. Sir, Aden is a central distributing port and through Aden our produce is being distributed in the whole ot Arabia and even Africa. Aden has been our valuable market and, m these days of depression, when the condition of our agriculturist is so miserable, I ask, is it not the duty of this Legislature and of this Government to do all they can to encourage Indians and the people of Aden to keep up and even improve their connection with India ? . Sir, what is going on everywhere in the world ? Every ^nation is doing its best to find out markets for its produce and o ry f prence employment for its people. Why was the World cono _ held ? Why did the President of the United States make hm first d y to improve the depression and increase the va ue o is ' q- ra j a ? Sir, why the Japanese and Lancashire deputations are c g a here ? When the nations of the world are doing all this, ^ a . J° f m ^j as t Our people are being driven away from South Africa and Africa, and now it is proposed that we should be a p }1810 .legislative assembly. . - [18th Sept. 1933. jSardar G. N. Mujumdar.] which would drive away Indians from Aden and Arabia. Is this position Pitiable ? Should we be a party to such an action and thereby create not P 1 * , T tLink it is the duty of our Government not only tn, nitiable ^ Should we oe a pany tu more starvation ? I think it is the duty of our Government not only to, Aden but as often promised by them, to try and improve the condition of Indians iutside India and to establish connections in the world at large for the disposal of our produce and thus improve the half-starving eon- ditions in India. ',1,# J** 0 pm Sir when in 1921, an attempt was made to transfer Aden, the Bombay Government dtrongly protested, as will be seen from the pro ceedings of the Council of State. Again, in 1927, when the question of Aden came up in this House, not only Members of this House, but all the important bodies strongly protested against the transfer and even the Government of Bombay, through its Honourable Member, Sir Ernest ITofson and its Chief Secretary, expressed surprise at such an action in the Bombay Legislative Council. Sir, this is our &lt; position. I appeal strongly to Government to consider seriously our position and take courage in their hands and tell the British Government that they cannot be a party to their desire, as it is entirely against our wishes and interests. Sir, after all, the Government of India is also a part of the British Govern ment, and what is the fear if Aden is with us ? Why should they have any kind, of suspicion ? The people of Aden have stood by the Empire at all times and have contributed to the exchequer as willingly as the Indians. Even during the Somaliland war and the Great War, their sacrifices have been as great as those of any part of the Empire. If not for anything else, for the sake of sacrifices that the Aden people have made and for what Indians have done, I appeal to Government to respect their wishes and their trade relations. I assure Government that, if they respect them, they will always be having their good sympathies and it is that alone, I believe, Government must prize the most. Sir, with these words, I protest against the transfer of Aden. In conclusion, I may be allowed to ask our Finance Member to enlighten as to the total amount the Government of Bombay and the Government of India have spent on Aden for the last 80 years. I know it is a very big amount. Several crores of rupees have been spent by the Bombay Government and the Indian Government too. Will the British Government pay this large amount back to us 1 So far as civil population is concerned, we will lose crores of rupees. The Honourable the Leader of the House had made a very important state ment, the day before yesterday, with regard to the payment of annual contribution by India, towards the military expenditure at Aden, and, if this side of the House has rightly understood him, with the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government, the citizens of the Aden Settlement will be relieved of this payment and the Imperial Government will pay it. May T ask. why this discrimination 1 Is it right that India should pay this amount if Aden stands connected with India and if it is transferred to the Colonial Government, the Imperial Government should; come to the rescue of the Colonial Government ? I say, Sir, India is not rich enough to hear this burden and Indians hope that the Imperial Government will not look after her with a step-motherly affection. This is really an expense for the safeguard of Imperial trade-routes, and justice demands that it should be borne by the Imperial Government hereafter and, T hope, the Imperial Government will be generous enough to refund the enormous die co 1 S f onsist f Dideni ^ &amp;BT of ^ steam' ;e s sifiiteaniH ML it iKWttaoui m her cont] of a Here is a Wtoisthefi ™ with Mat we hi pfcflri cont 'Me Ml no 1 Mile we c)n Aden!® I, rores an Gove®' lack to os H res erv n ire at Adas yith the tif 1 he Adei S(G IS? ice HI er and.

Sir Leslie Hudson : Sir, neither I nor any of my Group have had the advantage of being supplied with the library of pamphlets which the Honourable the Leader of the Independent Party, Sir Cowasji Jehangir. has exhibited to the House. I am sorry because I have no doubt that I should have been able to add to my knowledge of the history of Great Britain’s taking possession of Aden and the reasons for which it was taken. My recollection of it is that it was consequent on the wreck of an Indian sailing vessel from the coast of Madras, belonging to the Nawab of Carnatic, at Aden, and the plunder of its cargo and the robbing of its crew and passengers, the survivors of whom managed to reach the port of Mocha where they got into contact with the agent of the Government of Bombay, that in due course an expedition was sent from Bombay to Aden, an expedition consisting of 700 British and Indian troops under the command of Commander Haines. That was the reason given for taking- possession of Aden, but the actual reason for gaining a foot-hold in the port and harbour of Aden was to furnish a harbour and a coaling station for those early steam vessels that have just begun to ply in the ocean between Bombay and Suez. Such a depot was necessary, because those vessels could not take sufficient coal for the long voyage between Bombay and Suez. Aden was the place chosen upon and the real reason for taking possession of Aden was for the formation of a coal depot there. Ever since that time, for nearly a hundred years, Aden has been one of the main fuelling stations of coal and oil throughout the world and, while I agree that large sums of Indian capital have been invested in Aden, there have also been very large sums of British capital invested in Aden. I should like Honourable Members to recollect this, for we have heard quite a number of Honourable Members opposite saying that, because of these Indian investments in Aden, there is a very strong case for India to retain civil control of Aden. - o When I heard Member after Member getting up and making use of that expression, it brought to my memory almost exactly similar argu ments which I frequently heard when I was in England, namely, that in view of the vast amount of British capital invested in India, Great Britain should retain her control in India. I wonder, if Honourable Members opposite will agree that the same argument should, with justice, apply. Although there appears to us on these Benches to be an obvious advantage in the unification of the control of Aden we do recognise and sympathise with the obvious desire in India that she should continue to control the civil administration of Aden. There is considerable strength in that sentiment. There is also something else besides sentiment behind that desire and that is the financial interests of Indian merchants, and that too will carry weight with Honourable Members opposite. 1 repeat that we have considerable sympathy with the desire of India to retain the civil control of Aden, and no doubt His Majesty’s Govern ment will take full note of the debates in this House and in the Lpper House. So, while we cannot support the motion of Air. Bhuput Sing, we shall not oppose that of Dr. Ziauddin. There is just one other point I should like to make. Ever since the late lamented Dr. Woodrow Wilson gave expression to the word sett-1812 legislative assembly.

It was ;#st the s really a friend of India in its infancy when it was nursed by Indian milk, but I cannot say that it is so now. It has tried to rouso the feelings of the Bengalis in these words : • “ The sooner Aden is cut loose from India, the better will Bengal be placed. It is hard to avoid using libellous language about the extra 4i as. salt duty imposed over two years ago in the interest of a handful of merchants working from Aden. Sir I take this statement as a libel upon Bengali patriotism. Sir, Bengal has always given the lead in every matter in India formerly but unfortunately at the present moment we have i\ot got such outstanding personalities as Messrs. W. C. Bonnerji, Mano Mohan Chose, Lai Mohan Chose Ananda Mohan Bose, Sir Surendra Nath Banerjea and others. Sir, some years ago, that great politician and patriot of Bombay, the late Mr. Gokhale, remarked that what Bengal thinks today India will think tomorrow. That was the compliment paid to Bengal in those days. He said : “Do not try to trifle with the feelings of the Bengalis. A race which can produce a scientist like Sir J. C. Bose, a jurist like Sir Rash Bihari Chose and a poet like Rabindra Nath Tagore is not a race to he trifled with.” That the editor of the Statesman, having lived so many years amongst us, could think that the Bengalis can be induced to support a motion like this, namely, the transfer of the port o Aden to the control of the Imperial Government, I consider nothing but a libel upon the posterity of that race of stalwarts and patriots. Sir, as I have said, I am at one with every one of the speakers who have opposed this proposal of transfer ; and there are two amendments and I may make it clear that I would have willingly supported the amend ment of Mr. Bhuput Sing, for I believe that, by remaining with India for nearly a century, Aden is and has become a part and parcel of India and we have a right to demand that Aden should be linked with India. of the ;S!»S Ifc ni( il is jiyself tothe •ijjjeT linos i juke yon, Sii iutfrial Memk isdofvktitisi a», nij'es to th 'iaSstetatsiioulc ii.

A tory, 'M.U. 4fl«rci® ; ftFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1813 if Here I find in an authoritative book, the authenticity and the correctness of which cannot be challenged, namely, the Indian Year Book, that : “ Aden was the first new territory added to the Empire after the accession of Queen 'a Its acquisition was the outcome of an outrage committed by local Arabs on the passengers and crew of a British Indian buggalow wrecked in the neighbour- Ea.” 3 Sir Leslie Hudson : I think that is what I said. j^r. Amar Nath Dutt : “ Negotiations having failed to secure satisfactory reparation the Government of Bombay despatched a force under Major Baillie which captured Aden on January 19th, 1839.” Mv Honourable friend wanted to give us an idea that it was in order to get a harbour and a coal depot, but here we find a different reason given. The troops were mainly composed of Indians and not, as mv Honourable friend would make us believe, Indian as well as European. Sir I shall not repeat what has been said by other speakers about the reason why Aden should be with India, and the criticism, that has been levelled against the so-called advantages that might be gained by senaration 'has also been dealt with amply. So I do not think it is necessary for me to go over the same ground again and, if I have taken 11T) a few minutes of the time of the House, it is in order to show that we Bengalis do not lag behind any of our Indian fellow-countrymen m protesting against a measure like this, although I am painfully aware that at times Bengal is not fortunate enough to get the same support from the people of other Presidencies. Mr. Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur : Mr. President, before I address myself to the question of the transfer of Aden, I 3 Ui,t £ read out a few lines from the column of the Statesman of th e&gt; 16t instant where you, Sir, hare been referred to as the dumb President. The opening paragraph reads : ' It was unfortunate that, throughout the discussion of the ^ es ^ v ?. the only non-official Member of ^ the Assembly who really understood the s bj the necessarily dumb President.” . ■ . Then towards the end, referring to the debate on the question o t e transfer of Aden, the paper says : . . •'&lt; Perhaps it is fortunate for everyone that the Assembly ^seldom Ei^tinm enoug^ to take stock of what it is doing and saying from °” e p ‘ ■ , libertY to plague the rulers for instance, urges that the press should be ccini . . • w hat it thinks about of Indian States but should be prosecuted with all rigour if U y uggion of Aden's Mr. Gandhi.

[18th Sept. 1933, [Mr. Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur.] Opposition M. L. A. : The Arabs who want Aden’s transfer are not really repre sentative. Lloyd-Churchill : The vocal Indian politicians who talk of Swaraj are not really representative of the masses. Opposition M. L A.: Aden and India are ours and must remain ours. Lloyd-ChurchiTl : Aden and India are ours and must remain ours.” That is how it concludes. I think, Sir, that what is really meant is the Home Government and that, instead of using- the words “ Lloyd- Churchill ”, it would have been much more appropriate to have said “ The Home Government ”. I have very closely followed the debate on the motion of the Leader of the House and I think three ourstanding facts emerge from what has actually happened regarding Aden during all these years for nearly a century and from the communique which we are asked to discuss. The first one which strikes me as the most important is that the Home Govern ment have long had an eye on the Settlement of Aden. But the idea in their mind appears to have been that, in this particular case, it was better to play a waiting game. They did not like the idea of taking possession of a lean calf. On the other hand, they said : “ Let it grow fat and then we shall have it.” Then the next point that occurs to me is that whenever the Govern ment of India profess to express a defined policy which the Home Government is pursuing or is going to pursue, their statements can only be taken as an expression of opinion which might or might not be carried into effect. Specially is this so when the matters relate to foreign and colonial policy. The third is that the burden of the annual contribution by India has been steadily on the decrease. There can be no two opinions on this aspect of Aden’s finances. I think, Mr. President, we have now reached a stage at which Aden, instead of her being a burden to India, which it has been for so many years, will begrin to show ever increasing Teturns on the credit side of India. As a matter of fact, I can say with confidence, that, in the space of another five or six years, the debit side will be completely wiped out, and the credit side will begin to swell. Mr. President, I am not going to enter into a controversy with my Honourable friend, Sir George Schuster, in relation to the financial effects of the transfer of Aden. I shall take the figure 'which the Honourable the Finance Member has stated i° a correct one representing the burden to India this year— 19o2-o3- and he put that figure at 15 lakhs and 60,000. As against that, we have to bear in mind that India will be losing every year something like one lakh and sixty thousand by way of loss in income-tax earnings on the principle that there cannot be double assessment to income-tax. I believe, if I have understood the Honourable Member correctly, the loss would come to about one lakh and sixty thousand rupees The Honourable Sir George Schuster : I told my friend that it was impossible to give an exact estimate, and that all I could say w r as that it would not be a large sum. Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur : Conceding, then, Mr. residenL that the burden to India is something like 15 lakhs this year,- lcl e present moment the expenditure and the income balance each jgatoaMttat ^to ik chi state lie Leader JiBttfoiss a# under dis [ip tint ■im questions isrditBg to affiwernnient •Mihtteranc ■ms of opinion; istto of tl elsklnowai itarof the' ik before ye mu siii-i aat hare alrei iwlas ahead iiheliand,tFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF.

Mr. President I shall not devote any time in dealing with the ancient history of Aden. I sha 1 refrain from paying my tribute fo Major Ba lev and to the other Colonel to whom my friend, Sir Leslie Hudson referred But, I think, I shall have to point out, that, in the course of the discus sion on this motion, when my friend, Dr. Ziauddin, said that Sir Denvs Bray had made two statements which could not be reconciled the Honour able the Leader of the House stood up and said, that the statements taken together purported to convey what we exactly were doing now Now Sir this is what Sir Denys Bray said. I shall quote his very words*: ’ “ 1 re P eat my promises that the transfer of Aden will not be effected without the House being consulted.” e Then, Sir, in the same speech, the Foreign Secretary has also said : “ I hasten to add that all idea of such a transfer has long since been abandoned.” —referring to the civil and municipal administration of Aden. Now taking those two statements together, I am in entire agreement with the Honourable the Leader of the House that' opportunity has in fact been given to us to discuss this motion, and if I have to reconcile with the communique under discussion the other statement made by Sir Denys Bray, namely, • that the Home Government had given up all ideas of a transfer, then, it appears to me that I need only repeat what I said just now, that on questions where the Government of India professed to speak on matters relating to foreign and colonial affairs, the last word lay with the Home Government and not with the Government of India, and their statements and utterances in this House could at best be taken only as mere expressions of opinion and no more. As a matter of fact, they reflect the utter helplessness of the Government of India in these matters. Sir. I shall now address myself to the obstacles which have stood so far in the way of the Home Government effecting their purpose. It was only the day before yesterday that my friend, Mr. Puri, while speaking on this motion, said,—what is the use of discussing this motion, the Home Government have already come to a certain decision, and all our talk here will be a waste of time,—indicating thereby that the Home Govern ment had already made up their minds and the matter which we are dis cussing now has already once for all been settled. Sir, while I am confl- dent on the one hand, that what the Home Government have done already will not now be undone, that is to say, that the military and political control of Aden will not be retransferred to India any time, I do trust, on the other, in spite of what my friends, Sir Cowasji Jehangir and Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad, have said regarding the entertainment of Europeans in place of Indians in Aden for the last few months and the permanent establish ment there of the National Bank two or three months ago replacing the small banks which were doing business formerly and the employment further in the Education Department of a European in place of an Indian who was holding that office for a long time,—although all these things may lend to show in a way that the Home Go\ T ernment was contemplating a transfer, I do hope that, when the point of view of this House and that oflegislative assembly, ^ : - [18th Sept. 1933. , rM r Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur.} . £ •„ ^aeed before that Government, they will see the the Council ofjjtate and that they will give up pursuing the line which they appear to have ta , , , , ■ T -i 1*1 ao deep into the whole case, but I shall just Now, Sir, I shal j g feel regard to three or four points. As •say a few words on wti ’ t s p 0 i n ts indicating the desirability regards the administration of Aden, I fin'd for the transfer geographical remoteness. Sir, arguing on that the first , C lon ® s ve ry close geographically to India, and, those lines, I submit tt ^ t be prepared to make a sporting offer as such, would the ^7 Can India expect that Ceylon would be to India of that for Aden ?

The next point made is purposes of admimstra . ^ federation. I wonder what those that Aden I ask, do those tiny little Indian words naturally fit I „ . federating structure ? Is the States in the ? The'last ground taken is dovetailing of the Federation nnder Imperial control. To this, that Aden is alrea y makino . ? ” Was not the transfer of the military I retort, Was that of o &amp; , pj- Excellency the Commander-in- Oiief°in^l927^ wh^f h^made^the^announcement on f floor of this Ho.e Chief m iyz/ v definitely transferred to the Colonial Sc f Thatta, a “heU “hat His Excellency the Commander-ic Office { mat ^ d After 1927 deputations have been coming Offiei popped th H ^ Excellency the Viceroy, the last one, Tbl™' on^His^ExceHency Lord after His Excellency assumed the rems of ThmJtad^^ transfer of the entire control of Aden to the Colonial Office. jl* since i The communique is very cautiously worded. Mr. President, lf y° u ’'j| only turn to the last sentence of the first paragraph, which I shall read out .. If it should be decided that the ad^hiet^n of Aden aho^be eepajaW from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the tono g would be established ’ ’— they would not commit themselves to saying that “ these conditions will prevail ”,— or that— ittlat, in thi W Mover] -- His Majesty’s Government vouchsafe to Aden the following conditions. They simply contemplate that the following conditions would-be estao- lished. And what are those contemplated conditions ? The first o is the relief afforded to the Government of India m the matte annual contribution of £150,000 sterling or about 20 lakhs a y ear - • not further develop that point, because, I have already pointed on the coming years there is a very real prospect of Aden yielding aiWf rath 'if Home Gov MWtO ; 3i(8ovemme:FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1817t e, r kkk M S, «!T; % ClOSfl-; trot cal mb% !

The present has been found to be the most opnortunc moment for the Home Government to take over the control of the civil and municipal administration, because they are afraid that, if Aden is allowed to continue any longer under the Government of India, the effect will be that the income from Aden will go on increasing and it might be that in the course of a few years, the Indian Government may be able to pay ’the cost of the military expenditure also from the revenues derived from Aden One thing which makes me feel what I have just said is that in the matter of income-tax, the law that is prevalent in Aden is not the law which is prevalent' in India. I am quoting it from a book, Sir, it is not of my own imagination. The Honourable Sir George Schuster : I may inform the Honourable Member that the income-tax law in Aden is the Indian income-tax law. Mr. Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur : May I know from the Honourable the Finance Member whether the average for six years is not calculated in assessing income-tax in Aden ? The Honourable Sir George Schuster : I do not know what my Honourable friend has in mind, but the Indian income-tax law applies to Aden. Mr. Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur : I think I have got the pamphlet. However, for the present, I shall not dilate on that point. Another thing which has struck me as rather remarkable is that the Home Government have consciously or unconsciously waited for nearly a century after the conquest of Aden, without having cared to take up the entire administration from the very beginning. It is only now, after as many as 93 or 94 years since it came into the possession of Great Britain, that any attempt is being made to take over the civil and municipal administration, and why they have delayed taking action earlier is not at all explained. On the 'floor of this House, the Commander-in-Chief stated in 1927—I am probably quoting his very words—that in consideration of Indian welfare and Indian interests the control of the civil and municipal administration of Aden would continue to be exercised by the Government of Bombay. That statement was made on the floor of this House by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, and I think the Home Government felt it rather awkward that, in the face of such a definite statement by a responsible Member of the Government, in the face of definite public opinion which had gathered round this question both in Aden and in Bombay, and of the attitude of the Bombay Government itself on this question which had expressed itself rather strongly,—because of these three things, Mr. Presi dent, the Home Government thought that they should delay the matter until people had to some extent’ forgotten what had happened and until the Home Government could find a much stronger weapon than the ones at their disposal at that moment. That weapon they had discovered now-- I mean the weapon of Federation. That is the main ground that 18 nc *^ advanced for a transfer. The second condition is the maintenance o - right of appeal to the Bombay High Court. But I need not discuss u matter at length, because as- Sir Cowasji Jehangir has alrea y a ’ . simply maintains the status quo and does nothing more. e mrc e lion is : “ His Majesty’s Government would maintain the existing pontj of making Aden a free port ”. But, Air. President, thei . °ft 1818 legislative assembly. [18th Sept. 1933. [Mr. Muhammad Muazzam Sahib Bahadur.] &lt;&lt; i lo ” tnplcpd on It reads : “ unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take P^ee ’k Mr. President even present ecu ,, d the rest 0 f it, what is it that they are dong? ^ rare ddug nothing in advance of the prevailing conditions. With * ‘‘unless ’’ and what follows it, it is indeed worth nothing In the fourth also they use the word “ unless . It says, unless such a course became ’in their opinion absolutely necessary We all know what L the significance of this word “ unless ” m Parliamentary papers and documents It is so easy to create the desired causes and then say that the Sten sought to be taken is absolutely necessary and they have got to do it. The fifth one deals with retaining in the Aden Service a proportion of 1, diar, Service Administrative personnel for some years, which, when f fmhrased only means that at the end of a few years, you would not have on l' in the Aden Administrative Services. The last one, Mr. President is much more definite than all the other conditions, and it says: T Vk-ir TT-in Af o O merit. ’ ’ Sir Cowasji Jehangir lias already dealt with this point and I need not dilate on it over again. I shall merely say this, that 5p,M ‘ from our experience of Kenya, the Fiji Islands and other Colonies the treatment accorded to Asiatics in those countries is something which every Indian resents. That, Sir, is a matter of common knowledge. There is no doubt that the Indians in the colonies aTe segregated and if tomorrow severance of control does take place in regard to Aden, what is there to prevent the European element there from insisting on a uniform law with regard to the Whites in all the Colonies. The European popula tion which is sure to grow in Aden, if transfer is effected, w T ill doubtless claim that the law which prevails in the other colonies should be made applicable to Aden and I doubt whether the Home Government would be able to resist the claim of the European element. Lastly, I would refer to the strategic position which Aden occupies on the principal trade route to the East. Who are all the people who are getting the benefit of that most important station ?—Australia, Ceylon, East and South Africa, the Federated Malay States and some other Colonies. I ask my Honourable friend. Sir Joseph Bhore, why then the expenditure incurred on Aden should not be treated as an Imperial charge. Should not the other Colonies such as Australia, who share the benefit of this trade route, be called upon to bear a share of India’s annual contribu tion equally with India, and let me assure you, Mr. President, that that is exactly what is going to happen once the transfer of control is effected. wtie &lt;T ' ng ireful® ^ ft ' stal isj «Ckir sb delate. 1 .priW leffl&amp;ers ijiiinec.! liliziete. l jiPSfflontiie a.iMjeneral eo I i(to propose l Prsdeii!

Only ^ the other day we were discussing a Bill to prevent the activities of the British Indian press and the Indian public in regard to the Rulers of Indian States. The principal reason stated in its Statement of Objects and Reasons, as necessitating such a measure, was that the Federation was being ^ fftaeit set up in the near future and a Bill of that kind was absolutely necessary and we are now told that for the same reason a step, like the one that is lathi now contemplated in the Government communique, has become desirable.FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1819 W1 r 'm % ^ealyi ^ieila T v ice urn 'ears, yonwe^ Thek, ioiiitaiiil t erelyatg iji Isbi^ 'a segi®:,;J rdtolfes iistiitjj ie EiirojsetT ected,iife lies ionic y : ovemeEUi rhici Atei 1 tie peopk -Anstrak ! r ites aid s®' dlore,idiy 5 i an Iipeis slate ik iakamiic resident, fe- controllfe iseanyffi'i? ittlatj®? lestiaisn^ lensille ® ■ the ac»®; the Kal® ^ tent of t'k Federaw^' absoWdy^ , like tie ® :i Both these have a common presiding deity, namely, the Goddess of Fed tion.

There are others who feel very strongly that they should get a chance to speak on this important motion. Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) • The Chair would remind Honourable Members once again about the rule Telating to closure. The Standing Order says that, where a closure has been applied, the Chair shall accept it, unless it is satisfied that there has not been a fair debate. Therefore, unless the Chair is satisfied that there has not been a fair debate, it is a mandatory injunction on the Chair that the closure shall be accepted. Twenty Non-Official Honourable Members have already spoken for a day and a half. The Chair finds that the number of Non-Official Members present is, on the average, about 30 or 32 and, under these circumstances, the Chair is not prepared to say that there has not been a fair debate. The Chair would like those Honourable Members who want a division on the closure to stand up in their seats. (After counting.) There is no general consensus of opinion in favour of continuing the debate and the Chair proposes that the division be not taken. Mr. S. 0. Mitra : Is it your ruling that I cannot claim a division ? Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) : Not on closure. So far as the closing of a debate is concerned, the Chair, even without the application of a closure motion, can always put the ques tion, when the Chair is satisfied that there has been a full and fair debate. Therefore, applying that principle, the Chair does not think that it is bound to put the closure to a division, when only one or two Honourable Members w T anted a‘division. Mr. S. C. Mitra : It is more than half a dozen Members that are claiming a division. Mr. President (The Honourable Sir Shanmukham Chetty) : Even half a dozen Members wishing a division on a closure motion is not indica tive of a general desire on the part of the House to have the division taken up. Mr. S. C. Mitra : There is a large number of Members on this side who are likely to speak ; so, if there is a division, it should be confined to Members on this side only, because Official Members are not going to speat on this motion.

The Honourable Mr. HOSSAIN IMAM (on behalf of the Honour able Rai Bahadur Lala Jagdish Prasad) : {a) With reference to the expulsion of four Chettiar bankers from Indo-China and the statement made by the Foreign Secretary in the Legislative Assembly in the last session will Govern ment be pleased to state what has been the ultimate result of the British authorities’ intervention in the matter ? (6) Is it a fact that a number of insolvencies occurred in Indo-China which led the Government to issue instructions to the courts to grant some sort of moratorium to the debtors ; that after these instructions had been with drawn the Chettiar bankers and other creditors took recourse to the law courts for the execution of decrees ; that the French Government asked the Chettiars to accept 20 or 30 per cent, of the dues and wmite-ofE the rest of the debts; and that on their refusal to do so four of them were asked to leave the country ? (c) Have the Chettiar bankers been allowed to return to Saigon as a result of the efforts of the Government of India ? (d) If not, what do Government further propose to do in the matter ? The Honourable Mr. B. J. GLANCY -: (a), (c) and {d). As a result of the representations made by His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Govern ment of India, the Governor General of Indo-China has rescinded the expul sion orders issued against two of the Indian bankers, who had not yet left the country. Negotiation between the Government of Indo-China and the Indian bankers are continuing and it is hoped that they will result in an amicable^ arrangement. The latest reports from Saigon indicate that the French autho- 1;r ; ® confine nties while unwilling for the present to rescind the expulsion orders passed against the mur Chettiars who have actually been deported are prepared to allow reni to return to Cochin China on safe conduct and to resume their business.

MOTION BE FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. Sir FAZL-I-HUSAIN The Honourable Khan Bahadur Mian (Leader of the House) : Sir, I beg to move : “ That the Government of India communique, dated the 20th June, 1933, regarding the future administration of Aden be taken into consideration ”. This motion is being moved in order to discharge the obligation that the Government had incurred when the question of the separation of Aden from India was raised in this House and in the other House some years ago. Those Honourable Members who have been in this House for some years in the past will remember that a Resolution on the subject was moved by the Honourable Sir Phiroze Sethna and discussed at considerable length on the floor of this House. The Government at the time adopted the policy of neutrality in the matter and the debate was conducted on that Resolution by the non-official lembers. The Leader of the House at the time wound up the debate by stating hat Government did not want to take part in the debate and that Government aS as .^^ e .°® c ^ a ^ Members were not going to vote on the Resolution. I have no ou t i, will be the desire of the House that the Government should adopt ^ e same attitude when the same subject-matter is being discussed now. With ynur permission, Sir, I may state that Government has already decided to adopt e same po icy in the matter of the discussion of this subject. If r’ k° wever &gt; like to make one point clear before I resume my seat, -i 1 1S ' . la y e no doubt the Honourable Members have carefully studied wbirL^Lr 1 .' 1 re f errec l 1° i n Die motion wherein the conditions under nf; 18 1 a J es ^ ® Government at present contemplate dealing with this question are set forth and the first condition is that- present payable m anilua l contribution of approximately Rs. 20 lakhs at P sent payable towards the military and political administration”. of India W ^° P a T Giis money instead of the Government called unon ° m +i?- Ua ^ erS ^ ^ as k een felt that the people of Aden may be ernment to stat^tb ^ a ^ s ' ^ am authorised, Sir, on behalf of Gov- nlate mulctiro tb wi 18 ' a l es ty’.s Government do not in any way contem- ffis Ma Ws g rn e v P !°? le t0 the of this sum.

Two of them have not been received in time and they are barred under Standing Order 64. However, as the matter is of very great importance, I propose to suspend the operation of the Standing Order and permit the introduction of both the substituted propositions of Rai Bahadur Lala Mathura Prasad Mehrotra and Sir Phiroze Sethna. I wish, however, to point out that I do not propose to stick to the order in which these substituted motions appear on the paper. I propose to give precedence to Sir Phiroze Sethna’s substituted motion because it is more definite and comprehensive in character than the other two, and it is the privilege of the Chair to exercise its discretion in the matter ar d I wish to give precedence to the motion of Sir Phiroze Sethna. As regards the other two motions I will, immediately Sir Phiroze Sethna has addressed the House, call upon the two Honourable Members and leave it to their good judgment to consider whether they will press their amendments or not, because in my opinion their motions are fully covered by Sir Phiroze Sethna’s substituted motion. I wish also to point out to the House that in case Sir Phiroze Sethna’s substituted motion is passed, I shall not put the original motion for consideration again because Sir Phiroze Sethna’s motion will be substituted for the motion of the Honourable Sir Fazl-i- Husain. The debate will now proceed. Sir Phiroze Sethna. The Honourable Sir PHIROZE SETHNA (Bombay: Non-Muhamma dan) : Mr. President, I am very grateful to you for allowing my amendment to stand as a substituted motion and also for permitting it in spite of the fact that I was not able to give you timely notice as required by section 6 of our rules. I now formally move my substituted motion which reads as follows: “ This Council after duly considering the Government of India Press commiiniqufj of 20th June, 1933, submits that whilst no longer objecting to the transfer to .nperia control of the political and military administration of Aden as it exists at presm , i definitely of opinion that its civil administration be continued with the Governmen India or if thought necessary to be re-transferred to the Government of Bom ay, u such civil administration not be transferred to the Colonial Office. The Honourable the PRESIDENT: I would ask the Honourable Member to insert the word “ should ” after the words &lt;£ civil administration Mso to substitute the word “ should ” for “ to ” after the word ' necessary , and also in the last line to insert the word “ should after the wor a tration ”.

[31st Aug. 1933. [Sir Phiroze Sethna.] flJTUI -sitiwUtj the The Honourable the Leader of the House has referred to the Resolution that I moved in this Council on the 26th September, 1921. It reads as follows : “ This Council recommends to the Governor General in Council that a representation be made to the Secretary of State for India that the administration of Aden be continued under the Government of India and not be transferred to the Colonial Office . As the Honourable Sir Fazl-i-Husain has told us, on that occasion Government very kindly, and very rightly, requested Government Members not to take part in the discussion or in the voting. We are extremely in debted to the Honourable Sir Fazl-i-Husain for assuring us that the same procedure will be followed in the course of the discussion this morning. The Honourable Sir Fazl-i-Husain added that the then Leader, the late Sir Muhammad Shaft, at the end of the debate surveyed the whole situation and stated that Government were going to observe perfect neutrality in the matter. Sir Muhammad Shaft’s words will bear repetition, and therefore, with your permission, I propose to quote them. He said : “ I can assure the House that the Government of India will take note of the opinions expressed in this House by various Members representing different interests. They will note the fact that Indian sentiment according to the various speakers is entirely opposed to this transfer. They will also take note of the fact, which has been positively stated y the Honourable Mr. Sethna and is endorsed by the Bombay Government that local opinion in Aden as well as in Bombay is also opposed' to the transfer. They will further take note of the fact stated by the Honourable Rai Bahadur Lala Ram Saran Das, that in 0 the position which Indians at present occupy in different parts of Africa—parts tha are under the control of the Colonial Office—Indians would prefer that Aden—tneir brethren, their countrymen, residing in Aden—should remain under the control of the Government of India rather than that Aden should be transferred to the control of the Colonial Office. All these sentiments which have been expressed in the various speec es delivered by Honourable Members today will, the House may rest assured, be carefu y borne in mind by the Government of India. The Government of India have not w pronounced in favour of this transfer and until they do, no Honourable Member has any right to assume that they are in favour of that proposition. Their position is, as announced by the Honourable the Foreign Secretary, one of benevolent neutrality tovar s the Resolution moved by the Honourable Mr. Sethna. They prefer to leave this Resou tion to the vote of the House. The official Members will take no part in the voting an Government will undoubtedly pay due regard to the final verdict of this House upon e Resolution moved by my Honourable friend ”. Mr. President, if this was the view that the Council held in September, 1921, I think 1 am perfectly justified in stating that the Council holds not only the same view todav but holds it in a greatly intensified form. (Hear, hear itaiile Membei ssteutkcmfello IM according Mreiiainun iMtleHou nimaiider-m- -‘'Nk that in l ^dovenment ®tteftinthe( tha Way on the ■ Provin ^ttsts of i Native Sir, even after 1921, there were occasional reports that Aden was going to be transferred, and in order to make sure on the point, questions were asm itoiAt ly an ca verv both in this House and in another place to which very definite replies were given by Government which I will quote. On 16th January, 1922, the then Law Member, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, in the Legislative Assembly said . H ^ Government have no intention of arriving at any decision without giving the e^ , Assembly an opportunity of discussion ”. Two years later, on 9th June, 1924, in answer to a question in this House t^ir John Thompson, the Foreign Secretary, observed as follows : matter of the transfer was under the consideration of His Majesty’s Governinen an i was not possible to say when a decision would be arrived at but that before a nPlsiliy ed totkll 1921, h iciltiatsw on of ,1k- • olonialOiff'» s, on jovemti We areeiK lg us tilt 5‘ m tliis ibm ,ea(k tk k e whole atti ect neudft ition. ami S* d: takeuotedM ifferent iit®* leakeisiii®^ beenpoati^* mnent tint 1 ' 1 ieywiflf** ran Das, s of Af»f prefer tM under i ^ FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 99 decision was arrived at, the Indian Legislature would be given an opportunity to express its opinion”. Such an opportunity, however, was not given to us, and this is where Government committed a breach of faith with the Legislature. On 3rd March, 1927, the then Commander-in-Chief, speaking on the Budget debate, made an announcement which simply staggered the Assembly. It came as a bo t from the blue. His Excellency said that the military and political adminis tration of Aden had been definitely transferred to the Home Government, and this, as I say, without any previous reference to the Legislature, bir, this was not enough. The announcement went on to add as fo ows • “ As Honourable Members are aware, the Settlement of Aden itself is P^P ]e&lt; J ^ very great extent, by cur fellow Indian subjects. The Government of In'ba have thought it right that their welfare and interests should not go outside the _en o , munici- of India. It wall accordingly be retained ; that part of the Settleme pality of Aden will remain under the Government of India . I would ask the House to note very carefully that what I am P r °P° s “| ^ my motion today is in substance what the Commander-m ne ami I have just stated. The Commander-in-Chief’s announcements surpiised tin ^ it is no wonder that in both the Houses there was very severe &lt;3 Indian attitude of Government in regard to this matter. 0 on ' , • me dj a t e ly Legislature kept in the dark, but even the Pro vine la . n ^Z'^ark, and that in concerned, namely, that of Bombay, was entirely i • w „ 0 ’f the Govern- spite of the fact that the Government of India knew e ^ . repr esentatives Blent of Bombay on the question.

[31st Aug. 1933. fctu -[Sir Phiroze Sethna.] - * announcement made by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in the Assembly. That announcement, as I have already said, was made on 3rd March, i927. On 10th March, 1927, the Home Member of the Bombay Government, Sir Ernest Plotson, introduced a Bill called the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Bill in the Bombay Council and in regard to the statement made by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Ernest said that the announcement came as a surprise to the Government of Bombay as much as to the general public. “ I am obliged to stress this point ”, said Sir Ernest, “ because during the discussion on the Bill both I and my Honourable friend the Chief Secretary assured several Honour able Members that we had no reason to suppose that a transfer was imminent, and indeed pointed to the fact that the Government of India had instructed us to proceed with the Bill as evidence that no immediate change was proposed. The details of the future system of administration at Aden are not yet known to the Government of Bombay, which ind Q ed knows nothing further than what has appeared in the press ”. Tins, Sir, proves my statement that even the Provincial Government most directly concerned with the transfer was kept entirely in the dark. This was, as I have said in 1927. In January, 1929, when ihere were fresli rumours of the transfer, questions were again askecl and Sir Denys Bray gave^a reply which consisted of two sentences which are very pertinent and to winn I v, ould respectfully request the earnest attention of Members of this Honouraole Council. The first sentence was : , l ^ my P romises that the transfer of Aden from India will not be effected without this House being taken into consultation ”. Maxxv the words my promises ”, which I may add were not fulfilled. The next sentence is still more pertinent. He said : I hasten to add that all idea of such a transfer has long since been abandoned ”. psiawentrega 4 Mil, as at pi .n-^jv-? ear f ^ a l er ’ w ^ en the Aden administration was proposed to be trans- f Ar , T1 . n , ' —“ auxuiiiibiraiion was proposed to ue nano p i 10111 le '°t eminent of Bombay to the Government of India there the ® 80 tumours of a subsequent transfer from the Government of India to 0ni f ^ . ce - Thereupon those interested in the Aden trade thought it tut inn w' ° ^ ai In deputation on His Excellency the Viceroy.

He emphatically endorsed the Foreign Secretary’s statement regarding the transfer to the Colonial Office that no such suggestion had been considered and undertook that, should it arise in future, all interests concerned would be consulted. The transfer now proposed would make no difference to the commercial relations of Aden with Bombay and, in his opinion, as at present advised, it seemed the wiser course all round. After an interval of another two years or less the White Paper was pub lished in March last. The only reference to Aden in the White Paper is in four lines, which read as follows : “ The Settlement of Aden is at present a Chief Commissioner s province. The future arrangements for the Settlement are however under consideration, and accordingly no proposals in respect of it are included in this document ”. Soon thereafter several British-Indian delegates were sent to London to confer with the members of the Joint Select Committee of Parliament, of whom I was one. After we reached London we learned that there was every chance now of the transfer to the Colonial Office being completed. Some oi us^ c e gates therefore thought it advisable to request an interview with the 1 'g Honourable the Secretary of State. He agreed to receive our deputaLon which was led by His Plighness the Aga Khan. A e laid our case be ore i mi and from what we gathered we understood that he was in sympathy wi e view we expressed. But at the same time he pointed out that because ^ mre was to be federation in India hereafter, which would consist on y 0 proi mcee and of Indian States, and because Aden was not a province t re ques ion wa very difficult. At the same time he hoped that the difiicu ty nug n no insurmountable. How he hoped to surmount the difficulty he 1 no S AL ifl might venture an opinion I think that if Aden continueo a^ e ore ,° jf under the province of Bombay perhaps the difficulty could e .^ e ™' 0 ^ e . f ', for that reason, Sir, that in my substituted motion I have said that if ^ g necessary the civil administration of Aden might be re- rams err Bombay Government. Now, Sir, I turn to the press communique to which the Honourable °f the House drew our pointed attention, and particmar ) discussion, in it which he thought we ought not to ignore^ in the course ° ^ to whv In the first place, I will deal with the three points m the conm . • Aden should not remain linked with India.

[31st Aug. 1933. futc ■m 4 [Sir Phiroze Sethna.] Then there are six points enumerated in the communique according to which Government try to make out that India would not be a loser by the transfer. I will deal with them seriatim. Point No. 1, on which my Honourable friend, the Leader of the House, has laid particular stress is that India will be saved a burden of Rs. 20 lakhs a year. I dispute the figure of Rs. 20 lakhs and I shall endeayour to prove that the figure is not correct. In no case are we expected to pay more than a maximum of £150,000 or, say,Rs. 20 lakhs according to the arrangements made in 1927 and in accordance with the reply given this morning by Government to a question asked by the Honourable Mr. Mehrotra the amount at present is about £119,000 or Rs. 16 lakhs. Now, against this Rs. 20 lakhs Government must set off what the Government of India will lose in the shape of the rex enue which it derives from salt and also from income and super-tax. I make out roughly that Government will lose Rs. 10 lakhs under the heads I have quoted. Let me give you the details under the heading Salt. With regard to salt, the Govern ment of India get a royalty of eight annas for every ton of salt exported. According to the latest figures, the export of salt in a period of 12 months amount ed to over 280,000 tons and consequently Government will lose Rs. 1,40,000. Government also get ground rent for land where the salt is made which is another loss of Rs. 25,000, or in all Rs. 1,65,000. Again, so far as lean make out, the four salt factories in Aden pay between them income-tax and super-tax to the extent of Rs. 3| lakhs or more, so that the total of these two items alone exceeds Rs. 5|; lakhs. I explained that the Government of India will lose Rs. 10 lakhs, and I pointed out how the loss is Rs. 5j lakhs or more under salt alone. The difference between Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 5^ lakhs is made up by the amount of income-tax and super-tax under heads other than Salt. My estimate is on the conservative side and perhaps Government may lose more. I am glad that the Honourable the Leader of the House has said that if there are mistakes or misapprehensions in any statements we make hewi correct them in the course of his reply and I do hope that he will be g 00 enough to answer the point that I have made. The Honourable the PRESIDENT : I request the Honourable Member to be as brief as possible ; he has already exceeded 20 minutes. The Honourable Sir PHIROZE SETHNA: I shall be very grateful if you will give us some latitude. Government require our views and I um endeavouring to give them. I am very grateful to you, Sir, for the latitude you have already extended to me and I shall be still more grateful if you will give me more time. ;or Itisther fifi pteseat ecc iilttcononnc i 2 « Ko. 1 say *1 ml they wo jsraeadmiiiistr iitke-A 'rathe pr 'i mt is nit s w Indians Jifte matter Now, Si Utley favou will have day. me same giaour The Honourable the PRESIDENT : I am only asking the Honourable Member to be as brief as possible. The Honourable Sir PHIROZE SETHNA : I shall be as brief as possible and avoid anything irrelevant. • To come back to the Press communique, Item No. 2 says that the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be mam- ' * they do not allow' appeals to be sent to the Bombay High Court, what would happen ? They will have to be sent much further away to London fNerm P! U..FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 103 instead of to Bombay ; or to establish an Appeal Court in Aden which will be a mostly process. It is therefore by no means a favour to the Bombay Govern ment or to the Government of India if appeals will be sent to Bombay. Item No. 3 says that Aden would be made a free port unless some radical change in our present economic situation should take place. All these points have “ ifs ” and “ ands ” attached to them for they say £ if there is a change in the economic situation it will not be a free port. Likewise No. 4 says that the present style of administration would be maintained and they would not impose any additional taxation unless mark you there is £ ‘ unless ” here again—unless such a course becomes in their opinion absolutely necessary. I now come to item No. 5. The communique says that a proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained m the Aden service -and please note- ££ a proportion ” will be retained and the rest will be sent away, and even the proportion 1, that is retained will oe lemnitj years ”, which means that at the earliest opportunity they wdl be asked to go away. And what is more important, in the future under the Colonial adm tration no more Indians will be taken, which will also oe some m e country in the matter. . Then there is the last item, which is perhaps the most important o . , g said no racial legislation or segregation would be permi e &gt; assurance Government. Now, Sir, we have very grave doubts if m spite of t y ^ that Government will be able to maintain this piomise oi Colonial you why ?

[31st Aug. 1933. pui [Sir Phiroze Setlma.] measure the trade of the Settlement. It will be no exaggeration to say that the barren rock of Aden with her population of 3,000 inhabitants has been converted into a prosperous port with a population of more than half a lakh by Indian men and money, by Indian resources and enterprise. It is therefore the duty of the Government to give us a patient hearing and to do us justice. We do not want to go under Colonial administration because we know that in that event Indians will have to leave the Settlement for reasons that I will deal with in our second objection to which I now turn. Near Aden, as the Honourable House knows, is Somaliland. Somaliland was at one time administered by the Bombay Government. So long as it was administered by the Bombay Government, its three ports, Berbera, Bulhar and Zaila, were prosperous. They were going on from strength to strength. After the Somaliland war the Home Government thought it right to transfer Somaliland to the Colonial Office. With what result, Mr. President ? These three ports are now practically dead. Tire population of Berbera has fallen from about 20,000 to 4,000 or less and likewise the others. And why, may I ask ? Simply because the Indian traders left these ports and the Arab and Jewish traders followed in their wake. They did so for the same reason, namely, that they did not w T ant to be under Colonial administration. Colonial administration is distinctly costly. Because it is costly taxes have to be raised. The Somaliland ports were almost free ports but soon duties were imposed and increased to meet the higher cost of administration and the result was Indian, Arab and Jewish traders left and the trade of these ports has completely dwindled down. The same must perforce happen in Aden if Aden is trans ferred to the Colonial Office and I may not be alive but our successors in this House will have occasion to say that I was a true prophet. In support of our third objection that Colonial administration is more costly let me give just one illustration. When Aden wuis under Bombay, a representation was made to the Bombay Government that two Indian educa tional inspectors be replaced by two Europeans with salaries almost if not actually double. Because Education is a portfolio held by a Minister in Bombay, he stoutly opposed this, with the result that so long as Bombay was in charge of Aden, Aden did not get the tw T o European educational inspectors. After Aden was transferred to the Government of India, the request was repeat ed and granted and two European inspectors have been sent. The same thing will happen in all other departments and in proof of that I may again* refer the House to a press communique which says that only “ a proportion ’ of the Indians now there will be kept and that too only for a period of years. Now, Sir, talking of the extra cost of Colonial administration, I may say in passing what is thought of it in other parts of the Empire, I mean in other Colonies. I returned from Europe this day last week. On board the P. and O. steamer I came by were some Jellow passengers who were civil servants from the Straits Settlements and the Malay btates. We were comparing notes with regard to the different civil services. They volunteered the*information that their cadre is far larger than should be the case as compared with the cadre of the Civil Service in this country. But at the same time they said they had very little work to do. I naturally inquired, why don’t you ask for reduction in the number of posts and more pay ? They said such a proposal had been made, but the Colonial Office dfeiglit, W .’Hot from B idtagong, i Sffort and t! ibljeetioi ^Office, ^ilen: ^ofehstei ’•®l)eIo5tb to bar i ^ Arabs bitta % the idI n sti eis. Is miiiistafc ■- taxes kve^ 5 , ir; pK litf* ,, * [ , f . eniufl^ 5 FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. did not want to increase their pay, what they wanted was more posts. One of them said ordinarily they have four civil servants there to do the work that is done by one civil servant in this country. Therefore if Aden goes to the Colonial Office the number of appointments is bound to be in creased and the cost will be so much more that Indian tax-payers who are the largest tax-payers there will have to pay a great deal more. Onr fourth objection is that the trade of India today runs to some crores of rupees—seven or eight crores or more. This is to some extent due to shipping facilities that exist, by which I mean that because there are salt factories in Aden from which salt has to be imported into India and rather than that those ships go empty to Aden to bring this salt, there is shipped from this coun try by these boats a large amount of Indian produce and that helps to reduce the rate of freight. What goes there is rice, wheat, grains, tea, gunnies, piece- goods, etc.—not from Bombay and Karachi alone but from Malabar, Calcutta, and even Chittagong, Akyab and Rangoon. xAnd why ? Because Aden is a distributing port and this produce is sent from there to Arabian, African and even Iraq provinces. My point therefore is that if Indians leave Aden as they are bound to, this large trade wall be lost to India. You may naturally inquire, why should not any other traders take their place ? I say they will not. Indians conduct their business on different lines. Those who come in their place will not do the business on a credit basis same as the Indians do. Our fifth objection is that, if Aden is not included in India and is transferred to the Colonial Office, then, because Aden salt pays only excise duty and not protective duty when it comes to India, the salt industry in Aden is bound to oe crushed out of existence. These factories will be closed down and ihe la Jis sunk in them be lost but what is of great importance, and which I would a&amp;c Government to bear in mind, is that out of ^Aden's population of over oO, , there are 2,500 Arabs who work in the four salt factories there and this large number will be without employment. Sir, I can easily multiply these reasons for objecting to the proposed transfer but I will not take up any more ime of the Council. I will now just briefly refer to one objection in connection with my original Resolution of 1921 raised by Sir Denys Bray. He expressed the fear at that date that the Arabs and Jews were siding with the Indians but how Mng^ &lt;,u 1 ® Arabs do so ? He thought that as soon as the Arabs are educate , e y wou n °t join forces with the Indians. The long period of 12 years has elapsed sm then. The Arabs have not wavered in their affection and intneirmgar sympathy with Indians and for good reasons they as well as i re P , to act in concert with them. They know that the presence ot - them and therefore there is no talk and no fear of their not helping 10 “ j know.when ^ w as in London some months ago much capital v as ora e petition signed by 32 people and sent to the Viceroy throng tin. _ 1 ^ S . 10n f r °t' Aden.

[31st Aug. 1933. [Sir Phiroze Sethna.] J And what about our Jewish friends ? The Jews in Aden are not Jews fmm the Levant as they are in South Africa, and where they are favoured and Wed as Europeans. ” The Jews in Aden are Baghdadi Jews, and as mucli Wtics as the Indians or the Arabs there. Both the Arabs and the Jews know iust as well as we do of the Colonial policy to which I have referred. Thev know the Colonial policy of European powers. It is not the British alone, for the policy of Italians inMussowah and Italian Somaliland or of the Dutch m Java and Africa. In Java is just the same discrimination in favour of the white man against the Asiatic. We full well realise that no matter what professions or promises are made today they are bound to be broken. The Home Government must create some excuse or other to meet the wishes of Europeans in other parts of the Empire to see that no favour is extended to Asiatics in Aden which is not extended to them in other colonies. I said. Sir, in the earlier part of my speech that the political and military administration is already taken away from the Government of India. We recognise that the British Empire is great and that it must have military out posts both near and far. Aden may well be regarded as the Gibraltar of the East so far as the British Empire is concerned. We certainly have a grievance that the transfer of the political and military administration was made without our consent and without our knowledge but India is a member of the great British Empire and for that reason we no longer press for the return to this country of what is already transferred in the way of the political and military administration. So far as the civil administration is concerned we protest and protest most stoutly for the reasons I have endeavoured to place before the Council. I do hope, Sir, that Government will accede to our wishes and keep the civil administration with the Government of India or if necessary with the Government of Bombay. It is one thing for Government to ask for our opinion and quite another if Government do not give heed to that opinion. We do hope that the Leader of the House will give us an assurance that if the view held by the Legislature is against the transfer that Government will consider itself bound to respect the wishes of the Legislature and their wishes are what is practically desired by the country at large. (Applause.) The Honourable the PRESIDENT : Substituted motion moved: roifrie fliowaitf aiiiflistrati sMUg, tie Bri intafeithei sitavadmi “ That this Council after duly considering the Government of India Press communique of 20th June, 1933, submits that whilst no longer objecting to the transfer to Imperial control of the political and military administration of Aden as it exists at present, it is definitely of opinion that its civil administration should be continued with the Government of India or if thought necessary should be retransferred to the Government of Bombay, but that such civil administration should not be transferred to the Colonial Office.” As this is a very important debate I will dispense with the time limit pr es ' cribed by Standing Order 61, but I will leave it to the 12 Noon. good sense and judgment of Honourable Members to take as little time as possible as there are many Honourable Members anxious to speak on the motion. The Honourable Mr. VINA YAK VITHAL KALIKAR (Central Pro vinces . General) : Sir, after the able and eloquent speech of my Honourablethi di Jews, faToiristE- lust tee as tie Oite‘ tainlvteeif for tie kW; icemed'fep- e d to plated jf uecessaR*-' jtoasH^ $0 the ite»» ued^ 0 clef®- FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. friend, Sir Phiroze Sethna, I think there is very little left for me to say on this subject. The amendment which I have tabled covered a wide range of ground, but as my Honourable friend, Sir Phiroze Sethna, who has studied this question for a long time, who waited on a deputation on the Secretary of State recently and who was spokesman of that deputation, has stated that so far as the political and military administration of Aden is concerned, these can be transferred, I do not propose to move my amendment. Of course, being a young man, and having full faith in British justice, I think the people of India have got a claim even on this point on His Majesty’s Government, and the people of India rightly hofq—J am at least optimistic in that view—that as the future constitution of India is coming, the British Government at that time will reconsider their view and retransfer the military and political administration of Aden to the Government of India. As my Honourable friend has advised me not to move my amendment and put forward that claim, I refrain from doing so. Sir, this question of the transfer of Aden has been engaging the attention of His Majesty’s Government for the last, I may say, 13 years. After the con quest of Aden, for about 80 or 85 years,/this question did not strike His Majesty s Government, but only in 1921, when in answer to a question m the House ot Commons, the Prime Minister replied on February 28th, 1921, that the question of the transfer of the administration of Aden was under the consideration ot the Colonial Office. My Plonourable friend, Sir Phiroze Sethna, has quoted m detail the answers given by the Government of India on various occasions o questions in relation to this subject. I shall not repeat them. On a n occasions, the Government spokesman in both the Houses assured n ' . posals will be made regarding the administration of Aden withou c0 ^ su the Legislature. But what do we find ? In 1917, as a war measure, the pon- tical and military administration of Aden was taken over oy t le om ®. j m ment without even consulting the Indian Legislature. In 1 m t, 6 pp o | -j military administration of Aden was taken over permanent y y ‘‘j „ w i- A Office, and that we came to know only through the Commandoimi- n ^ he made the statement in the Assembly. That shows bha ie ^ military lature was not consulted so far as the transfer oi the po i i ca ' Without administration of Aden to the Home Government was concerne • ^ even consulting the wishes of the people of Aden or taking m o c ^ wishes of the various interests involved, they transferred rep the tary administration permanently to the Colonial Office. cr ’ r Bombay Civil administration of Aden was transferred from the J, to the Government of India.

As said bythe Honourable Sir Phiroze Sethna, in fact the ,201 British officers encouraged the people to go there, to invest lar^ e sums of money there, to start the salt industry, and to do many other things to improve the condition of Aden. Now, Sir, the question is whether the wishes of the people of Aden are to b e _ considered in regard to the question of the transfer of its administration- f According to the principle of self- determination, the wishes of the people of Aden ought to be considered before Aden is transferred to the Colonial Office, But what do we find ? When the attention of the people of Aden was drawn to the announcement in the White Paper that the future arrangements for the Settlement were under consideration, they held a mass meeting on the 16th April, 1933, and adopted a series of resolutions, copies of which were sent to the Government of India. At that mass meeting the Arab, Jew and Indian merchants of Aden and others who have vested interests in Aden were present, and the purport of the resolutions which they passed is that if the administra tion of Aden is transferred to the Colonial Office it will be detrimental to the interests of the residents of Aden. They also sent in representations to the British Government and to His Excellency the Viceroy. I can quite under stand the suspicion existing in the minds of the people of Aden and various business communities in Bombay that the question of Aden’s transfer will be decided against them, though they are every now and then told that their wishes will be considered. That is what actually happened in 1931 when the civil administration was transferred to the Government of India. So my submission is if you really desire to consult the wishes of the Indian Legislature and of the communities whose interests are involved, you should not only gi ve due consideration to, but carry out, their wishes. Well, my Honourable friend, Sir Phiroze Sethna, has dealt fully with the points stated in the Government communique of the 19th June and I do no want to repeat the arguments. But I submit that the plea of giving rehe to the Indian tax-payer to the extent of Rs. 20 lakhs is occurring to the British Goyernment—I am not including the Government of India—because they are insistent upon getting Aden under the Colonial Office after 85 years. Porthe last 80 or 85 years—I am open to correction—according to my information ■a out Rs. 55 to Rs. 60 lakhs of the Indian tax-payer’s money has been spent on Aden per year, but His Majesty’s Government did not come to the rescue of the Indian tax-payer and they did not suggest that because the India 11 ,f X P a y er was Paying so much they would take away the administration from i 'L. ° Ver ^ n * en t °*' -i- n&lt; di a - It is only after Aden has been transformed from a „ to “ P ros P«»us port that the question arises and the Indian W- L y 2o S? irP P® and told tha ‘ tw ba the gai !!? * sst«® 2 imiks ^ipaaaro Jwtii, wifmymfi were al NtlieLes iiitratioi, ^deprive b If India ^ BONO' WH n so ti Selves not re safetv of fL + ^i° W ’ ^ r ’ ^ nt ^ a l las been paying this Rs. 20 lakhs to ensure AitLil aoPltTbC 0 ,®? 81 and Soutl &gt; Africa, Ceylon, British Malaya^ &gt; Vialc i l ?

The Indian tax-payer has to spend not lakhs but crores on military expenditure. The Government of India have agreed to give a sub vention to Sind and the North-West Frontier Province—— The Honourable the PRESIDENT : Will the Honourable Member confine his remarks to the scope of the motion ? The Honourable Mr. VINA YAK VITHAL KALIKAR : I was simply putting up an argument, Sir. I do not want to digress and quite agree with your suggestion. I therefore say that in the interests of their own brethren the Indian tax-payer will not grudge paying Rs. 20 lakhs. Well, Sir, after the war, if my information is correct, South Africa, Australia and the other Dominions were allotted ex-enemy territories for administration under ^ the guidance of the League of Nations. India not only was not given an\ territory for administration, but instead she is being deprived or attempts are being made to deprive her even of this territory, and that after the valuable serv ices rendered by India to the British Empire in the Great War. I submit that justice requires that if really the majority of the people of Aden and Indian merchants with vested interests there find it desirable t a &gt; en should be transferred to the Colonial Office. I should persona y ave n objection. But the protest that has been raised clearly shows t mt i ^ a S a * their interests. It is against the interests of India as a who e an ere I submit that Aden should not be transferred to the Colonial Office.

[Rai Bahadur Lala Mathura Prasad Mehrotra.] for that injustice by depriving India of even the remaining control over it. My Honourable friend has already said that we do not question the military and political control of Aden, but certainly we shall fight to our level best if the civil administration is also going to be transferred. Then, Sir, the communique states the five points in favour of its transfer to the Colonial Office of which the first and the last are very important. The first states that India would be relieved of the annual contribution of approximately £150,000 sterling or Rs. 20 lakhs at present payable towards the military and political administra tion. My Honourable friend, Sir Phiroze Sethna, has already stated that . India will get Rs. 10 lakhs out of the revenues that will have to be transferred to the Colonial Office with the transfer of Aden. Sir, the other day I put some questions to the Government to get information about the income and expenditure of Aden and for the information of the House I shall just read the answer that I have received only on the 29th of this month. In answer to my question about the total cost of administration of Aden, civil as well as military, the Government have said that the contribution for political and military expenditure in 1930-31 w T as £150,000. In 1931-32, it was £136,499. In 1932-33, (to March, 1933) it was £119,959. From these figures we find that the military and political expenditure is decreasing considerably and has come down from £150,000 to £119,959. As regards the civil expenditure the figure is also de creasing as we find that in 1930-31 the civil expenditure was Rs. 12,45,500; in 1931- 32, it was Rs. 11,39,000 ; in 1932-33, revised estimate, it was Rs. 11,01,700. The House will find that the civil income of Aden is increasing every year. In 1930-31, the income was Rs. 10,27,588 ; in 1931-32, it was Rs. 12,04,100; in 1932- 33, revised estimate, it was Rs. 13,64,000. Thus from Rs. 10,27,000 it has gone up to Rs. 13,64,000—an increase of about Rs. 3 lakhs during the last two years. We find on the one hand that our expenditure on Aden is not in creasing, but diminishing ; on the other hand, our income is gradually increasing, so instead of paying Rs. 20 lakhs as suggested in the communique, I think in the course of a few years India will not have to pay anything for the mainte nance of even the military and political administration if it is also transferred fiom the C olonial Office. Then, Sir, the other point and the last one, is the most important, and it is lltalay Presit gitii its adnw a On tie ass Main a pa 1 “ that racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s ernment . ^ Gov- As my friend Sir Phiroze Sethna has said, these are only paper assurances and they will have to give similar consideration to all the Asiatic nations.

On the assurance of the Government of India that Aden would ever remain a part of India the Indian merchants were encouraged to start new openings of trade and industries at Aden and to develop the same. The belief of the Indian merchants that Aden would ever remain a part of India was only natural, for well over 8 years no move on the part of the Govern ment was made to indicate their intention of transferring Aden at any time to His Majesty’s Government. As a matter of fact this belief led the Indian merchants to develop the “ Barren Rocks of Aden and to turn them into a prosperous territory. As a result, the population of Aden, which was hardly 3,000 at the time of its annexation, has increased to about 53,000 at present. (At this stage the Honourable the President vacated the Chair, which was taken by the Honourable Nawab Malik Mohammad Hayat Khan Noon.) A cursory glance at the trade returns will convince any one of the magni ficent part which Indian enterprise has played, for about a century now, m t e development of Aden. Not only this, the Indian merchants have also ^een responsible for bringing modern civilisation to the original tribes o en, which have been alwmys loyal to His Majesty the King Emperor. is ac &lt; should undoubtedly be a matter of pride to the British Empire. The question of the transfer of Aden dates back to 1921 when, for the first time, on the 28th February, 1921, the Prime Minister made a s a emeni the House of Commons to the effect that the responsibility or t e a tion and policy in Palestine, Mesopotamia and Aden was to e trans (ire Colonial Office. As a mark of protest against the reference of the transfer of Aden Prime Minister, Sir Phiroze Sethna moved the following Resolu Council of State on the 26th September, 1921 : “This Council recommends to the Governor General in Council ^^^^^^ntinued be made to the Secretary of State for India that theadmims ra office”, under the Government of India and not be transferred to n o - this Resolution, the Honourable Mr. Prat, ^ ^ed Speaking on ^—, ML theview on behalf of the Government of Bombay attitude of the Bombay Government towards the qu i i , i ^Tr»r&gt;n ty stion of the transfer of , iIU U. -y 'fc f* 012 Aden to the Colonial Office could not, under any circumstanc , p&gt; on ihay and trality and indifference for the reason that public opinion, ^ ^ ( j en isiatic Aden, had emphatically expressed itself that ^ e N 10 ra pi e Mr. Pratt the should not be handed over to the Colonial Office. e trading communi- also stated that very strong protests had been ni ac e n r-i no t desire any ties of Bombay and Aden tnd so the Bombay Government did change in the status guo.

He also said that the Government would take into consideration the facts as stated by Sir Phiroze Sethna and supported by the Government of Bombay that local opinion in Aden as well as in Bombay was definitely opposed to the transfer. He further said that the Government would also take a note of the fact stated by the Honourable Rai Bahadur Lala Ram SaranDas that, in view of the position which Indians occupied in different parts of Africa under the control of the Colonial Office, Indians would prefer that Aden should remain under the control of the Government of India rather than that it should be transferred to the control of the Colonial Office. In the end, Sir Muhammad Shafi emphasised that Honourable Members had no right to assume that the Government of India was in favour of the transfer so long as they had not pronounced a definite opinion on the matter. It is important to note in this connection that the Council of State adopted the above Reso lution as moved by Sir Phiroze Sethna. Speaking on behalf of the Government of India on the 16th of January, 1922, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru assured the Legislative Assembly that they would be given full opportunity of discussing the question of the transfer of Aden before any decision was taken by the Government. In reply to a question in the Council of State on the 9th June, 1924, Sir John Thompson stated that the matter of the transfer was still under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government but that before a final decision was arrived at the Indian Legislature would be given an opportunity to express its opinion. The question of the transfer of Aden took a new turn on 3rd March, 1927, when the Commander-in-Chief announced in the Legislative Assembly that the military and political administration of Aden had been definitely transferred to the Home Government. However, in the same statement, he announced that in the interests and welfare of the Indian people residing at Aden, the muni cipal and civil administration of Aden would remain under the Government of India. Now, Sir, I would like you to refer to the speech of Sir Ernest Hobson, the then Home Member of the Government of Bombay, in the Bombay Legislative ouncil, while speaking on the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Bill, wherein he said that the announcement of the Commander-in-Chief came as a surprise, both to the public as well as to the Bombay Government, as no imminent change was foreshadowed by the Government of India on the question of the administra tion of Aden. In January, 1929, Sir Denys Bray stated in the Legislative Assembly that khe transfer of Aden from India would not be effected without consulting the ouse and further added that all idea of such a transfer had long since been abandoned. In 1931, the civil administration of Aden wms transferred from the Bombs Lrovermnent to the Government of India. The Indian, Arab and Jew residen x en protested against such a transfer because, among other things, th&lt; eared that rt was only a step towards the transfer of the control of Aden the Colonial Office.

In clause 5 of page 19 of the White Paper, a reference was made to the ndiausiE:: transfer of Aden, which showed that the question was still under consideration mentofliii and as such no proposal in respect of it could be included in that document. lonialOffet 'This statement in the White Paper alarmed the Arab and the Indian residents [emteslaisi 0 f Aden, who held a mass meeting on 16th April, 1933, and passed a series of 'thetransit!; resolutions on the subject. The purport of these resolutions was that Aden ter, It is i 1 ' be kept under the control of the Government of India and that the transfer of itedtheafe Aden to the Colonial Office would be highly detrimental to the residents of Aden. They feared that the Colonial Government would not be able to give^ V ](;v ; . to the Aden residents the same protection to their rights and interests as was e 14 tk gi vea by the Government of India.

We feel sure that if Aden is handed over to the Colonial Office, the Indian merchants will not only lose heavily as far as their trade and industry are concerned but as a consequence will be deprived of their other rights and privileges as well. We earnestly hope that the Government will not commit a breach of their promises by transferring the administration of Aden to the Colonial Office. The condition of the trade and commerce of India is already bad enough to cause anxieties and India has for various reasons very limited markets in the world for the disposal of its commodities. Indian merchants have spent enormous amounts of money and labour to bring Aden to its present important position, and it has always provided a permanent market for Indian produce. If Aden is taken away from India, then it would create insurmountable business diffi culties and hardships which would surely result in heavy losses to the Indian merchants. While, on the one hand, efforts have been and are being made to encourage trade and industry by means of trade agreements on the lines of the Ottawa Conference, and, on the other hand, by organising to hold the World Economic Conference in order to increase the volume of export trade, it is regrettable that the Indian merchants should be handicapped by the separation of Aden from India. (At this stage the Honourable the President resumed the Chair.) Indian merchants, both in India and at Aden/have always come to the rescue of the Government* in their difficulties. They have been paying to the Government lakhs of rupees by way of income-tax, super-tax and a host of other taxes. They also willingly offered their loyal services to the Govern ment during the most critical times of the Great War. Is this the proper return, I ask the Government, to the Indian businessmen, for their loyal and helpful services rendered by them that Aden should be taken away from India, and thus not only endanger their trade and industry in these bad days of unprecedented trade depression, but bring about their utter ruination ^ main consideration that has decided the post-war politics hinges on se h' determination ”, and this principle has been of late universally acknowledge in every country of the world. We, therefore, hope that the Government wi. seriously take into consideration our loyal services in the past and the constant pledges given to us by them. It is to be sincerely hoped that proper justice would be meted out to our ^ just claims, and that the administration of Aden will not be transferred, hut will be continued under the Indian Government. 1 i HE Honoura * le Major Nawab Sir MAHOMED AKBAR KHAN (JNorth-W est Frontier Province : Nominated Non-Official). Sir, the question o the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government ot India to His Majesty’s Government is one which I cordially support. I %j a ■ not at all in favour of the amendments brought forward, but I support the , separation on the clear understanding that the Indians as a whole, and the ^ I &lt; yathan or Afghan population in particular, should not be stopped from enter ing the Aden Protectorate as is the custom now.

I am not supporting the Leader of the House on any whimsical grounds, but I am supporting him from my experience of that part of the world during my 11 months’ stay in Aden while serving with the Aden Field Force during the Great War in 1918. All through my stay there I ha opportunities of going to its surrounding suburbs, to see things for myself, and I was greatly interested to see and examine the various places within this Pro tectorate. I have been to Crater, Shaikh Usman, Halwan,, Imad and Darrab which was the boundary of the Aden Protectorate in those days ot the urea War. All through its length and breadth I found the lands sandy and barren, and I do not think that they can easily be made to pay the expenditure incurr towards their administration and control. There are some tanks m ra er only, but these can never be filled up with water and they cannot improve any kind of cultivation there. WePs can be dug in some of these p aces an a though the water is brackish, there are possibilities of doing some sor o c u vation by means of windmills, but all these ways of doing cultiva ion C ^ 1 be expected'to yield the revenue equal to the expenditure incurre . . r ° . personal experience of those lands, I make bold to say that tea mmiS , of Aden is just like a millstone round the neck of Indian revenues, a sooner it is taken away from India, the better it is for , India and the Indian tax-payer, because, we the tax-payers vu en , of the annual contribution of nearly E s. 20 lakhs from the n lan J The reasons given in the Press communique suggesting the se ^ ^ a Aden from the Government of India are no doubt cogent ones an , are little bit of a futile attempt to try to refute them. At t e same i &gt; _ t p e allegations to the effect that out of this sum of Rs. 20 lak s con ^ g^pe of Government of India, nearly Rs. 12 lakhs are paid bae k o ^ j nc p a a } one various taxation, and the balance of Rs. 8 lakhs is not on y a a us t ra lia and hut it can be fairly divided over East Africa, Malaya ‘h e ’ , fairly other countries within the British Empire. Besides fndmgete a large portion of it in the way of salaries of the ^ n ^ ian r T nf u an mer- in Aden.

If, however, the ( lOt crnmei £ e( p era tion sever their connection with the backward people un er ^ trade and their scheme, care should be taken that the Indians do no ose _ j ern Aden, but in military services in Aden. I do not know anything a ou India and they 1918 the majority of its population liked the connec 1° e £ erence to others, welcomed Indian Muhammadan traders in those ^ ays 1 . q acc urate- Since I have not been to Aden after that I am no . ^ a 1' , that any ly what the state of affairs is there nowadays, u detest the Indian Muhammadan country, whether in Asia or in A rica, .. e j r c o-religionists Muhammadan in anyway.

The majority of the population of this Protectorate are Abdali, which is one of the tribes of the Afghan or Pathan peoples, and the Sultan of Lahij to whom the territory origi nally belonged is an Abdali Chief himself. So if there are any restrictions on other Indian Mussulmans after its separation from India, there should not be any check on the Afghan or Pathan population at least, because an Afghan will not be going to a stranger’s land but will be going to the country of his kinsmen, i.e., the land of the old Israelites who before their conversion to Islam were one and the same people and had a common ancestor in King Saul or Malak Talut. I am not so much anxious about any other section of the population in India, but I am chiefly concerned in the position of the Afghans to whom I would not like admittance to be denied in Aden, Palestine and Mesopotamia, where the Jewish population or those of Jewish origin are by no means insignificant since the days of their exile in Babylon. As Palestine has been set apart for the Hebrew population, it is quite immaterial whether they are Jews, Christians or Muhammadans, because being of Israelitic descent they can claim the same heritage as any other Jew. In case some assurance is forthcoming from the Government through the Honourable the Leader of this House in respect of these observations of mine I will support him whole-heartedly. Otherwise I will have the alternative of backing the amendments as they-stand. The Honoukable Mr. G. S. KHAPARDE (Berar Representative): Sir, I wish to support the amendment put forward by Sir Phiroze Sethna. I would not have spoken today but that unfortunately in all the papers that I read it has been said that everything that everybody has to say on this question will be taken into consideration. But we have already said it in 1921. I used to sit then in the same place that I sit in todav in this House, and my friend Sir hiroze Sethna sat very nearly where he is sitting now. We made out a representation at that time and we gave our opinion completely and without a single dissentient. What has become of that and why has this to be considered cannot understand that. We have given our opinion in ;silttihF £ al f eaieti pplatwei i it'is all ii ;am in India i Vekvf again . 1 cannot understand that. We have given our opinion in 1921 Me ! aV( ] never departed from it and we have been supporting it all through, ami sti oui opinion is wanted today. There is something suspicious about is matter and so I am going to speak. It appears to me that neither on the Government side nor on our side has the case' been frankly and fully stated. e a ee mg that something is being kept back, at any rate from my poiut o view. i' y nend Sir Phiroze has been very wise in limiting the matter to the ^ a us quo as it mands and making it comfortable for both sides to agree. He is attempting to build a bridge between their opinion and ours. If it had been +i Yl m V W ° U d haVe put the P ro P°sition a little higher.

England and India form at present what we in India call a joint Hindu family and England is the head of the family. But the apartments in the house are distributed to various members «:*of the family.

M of Aden rt'ii'Ri Mouse todi ffititliepie! •Wtransfe The Honourable Mr. BIJAY KUMAR BASU (Bengal: Nominated Non-Official) : Sir, I think I owe it to myself 1 p.m. as well as to this House to say straight oh what excuse I have to intervene in this debate. I have no connection with Aden either by consanguinity or affinity like my friends from Bombay or my friend Nawab Sir Akbar Khan who had served in Aden. The only connec- ^ na ! tion I have, as a Bengali, is that I eat Aden salt, and to be true to my salt I C ought to be able to say something about it. Sir, the real excuse that I have for ™ HIKABIJ intervening in this debate is that I am suffering from some intellectual tortures ever since I read this communique. First, as w r as very ably traversed by Sir Phiroze Sethna I find the words “ geographically remote ” giving me one of those tortures because when I find that we have places under the administra tion of the Govermnent of India which are more or less, shall I say fortunately or unfortunately, placed in the same position as Aden. Take, for example, the island of Andamans. It is in the very same inconvenient or convenient geographical position. Geographically, the Andamans is nearer to Ceylon than to India. Mhy does not the Colonial Government say,“ Give us the Andamans ”. AVe will be glad to make a present of it to them ; we would not stand in their way. Secondly, the communique says that Aden will hot natur ally fit into the new federation. Here again the question tortures me.. How can the Andamans be fitted into the federation, and if the Andamans can be fitted in to the contemplated Indian federation why cannot Aden be fitted in; it is not very difficult; if you can fit in the one, you can fit in the other. Thirdly, Sir, there is the question of the conditions set out in the communique. Let me frankly tell the House that these conditions are not worth the paper they are typed upon. I flatter myself that I have intelligence enough to see that these condi tions are nothing but words, mere empty words, for have we not seen pledges, more solemn pledges, thrown to the winds when it came to the scratch? Any- v ay, I for one would not attach any importance to these conditions and I would as ’ tie House not to attach very much importance to these conditions. Assum- mg t Pvt these conditions will be respected let us consider the first condition, which provides for the contribution by India of Rs. 20 lakhs towards the military anc political administration. I do not see why, after the declaration of 1927 , when • C i Ca J ai! ^ roilitar P a( dministration of Aden has been taken over by the Colo- ( 1 e ‘,^ le Indian Exchequer should be charged with this sum of Rs. 20 lakhs, 1 6 J 0 an&lt; d military administration of Aden has gone out of our hands, ^ S A P a } r ^is Rs. 20 lakhs ? In any event, Sir, I do not see any reason l u i T' ^ 1C ^ ^ as I ,een practically converted into a port of some importance by the labour and capital of India should be taken away without as much as paying e compensation. For 95 years India has paid the yearly contribution ot Ks. -0 lakhs, and in some years as much as Rs. 50 or Rs. 60 lakhs.

The Honourable the PRESIDENT. The debate will now be resumed on Sir Phiroze Sethna’s substituted Motion. The Honourable Mr. JAGADISH • CHANDRA BANERJEE (East Bengal: Non-Muhammadan): Sir, after the very interesting and exhaustive debate in the House today and particularly the illuminating speech of our colleague Sir Phiroze Sethna this morning in regard to the transfer of the administration of Aden nothing much is left for me to say. The rare unanimity with which this House has welcomed the proposition of Sir Phiroze makes me hopeful of the greater popularity of this House in the popular estimation. The development of animosity towards Second Chambers in the present day world is due to the halting and retrograde policy of Upper Chambers; but I am very glad to find that our House is free from this odium at least on the present occasion. The first advantage pointed out in the Government of India communique is the probable saving of Rs. 20 lakhs per annum but our friend Sir Phiroze Sethna has shown that the real loss would be only Rs. 10 lakhs. While these estimates are for the future, neither our Government nor His Majesty s Gocerm ment has a word to say about the loss which India sustained in the^94 years o our connection with Aden. This loss has been estimated at Rs. 15 to Rs. crores. I wonder if the Government is in a position to intimate to this House the welcome news of disbursement to India of its past losses by His Majesty s Government. In the absence of any definite offer from the Home Governmen of making good the losses, it will be foolish to expect us to be a consenting par y to this proposed transfer. Sir, for about 100 years, from 1839 till the present day, the Government of India bore all the burdens of the civil and military administration ot tni barren rock. The prosperity of the present Aden is to a large extent ue o indefatigable energy and enterprise of Indian traders who ha\ e gi\ en ® ir ! blood and all their resources to its well-being. Sir, the sad experience o n ians in the Colonies and possessions of the British Government is n ® + slK f ©• i warrant the new transfer of Indians in Aden to the tender mercies o ie Office. With these few remarks, Sir, I fully support the original amendment Phiroze Sethna.

Sir Samuel Hoare in the course of his reply was sympathetic towards Indian aspirations. He referred to the difficulty of including Aden in a federation wdiich consisted of provinces which Aden was not. At the same time he said that the difficulty w r as not insurmountable. And yet the communique states it W'ould not naturally fit into it; these two opinions seem to be rather inconsistent. The communique further emphasises the great import- f nc t. Aden Protectorate. This question w r as discussed at length y ir Denys Bray in 1921, when in the course of his reply to a Resolution protesting against the separation of Aden he made the flesh of Honourable .^ e un P r&lt;:)noiin ceable names of some of those Imams fooo • 16 8 ^ 10 uere deluded therein.

Coming then, Sir, to the question of the benefits that India would derive rom separation. I should like to quote here the opinion of one of the former Secretaries of State for the Colonies. a n 1 nr l Ji e ? ]gll i t i H0 T n0 1 Urable Mr - Winst °n Churchill said in the House of Corn el e ? ndia WaS g enerous enough to offer to the Colonial Office tn till ° a? 1 ’ be T aS n0t P re P ared in the interests of the British tax-payer WpH R 1 611 ^ eS ? was prepared to bear its portion of the burden, muni’ 2 ^,. 118 reconciled with the statement we have in the com- Itwa?noftWT n J a Would . be relieved of Rs. 20 lakhs payable at present ? to be takpn a-h • K ^ awa8 S° in 8f 0 voluntarily give up Aden but that Aden was Colonial Office 10111 wbetber ^ iiked it or not, and placed under the !m good re wi. floffliderin; istratioi kvet ■An): Sir, first -itle thy ha sJit British] N to the word £&lt; unlpcie ” 60 ei , conditions are concerned, specially Nos. 3 and 4, the A certain rhflno-y 8 ori ? mouS- ^ i s fraught with unknown contingencies. that contine-enoA ^R^ e crea-ted and we would be confronted with it.

Once however the Bill is passed the same question again arises. W e are then faced with the letter of the Act and the assurances are nowhere. Thus it is that such promises becon c useless unless definitely incorporated in the Act. Then, let us now look at what the Indian merchants have done for Aden. They have established hospitals, dispensaries, schools, and provided other amenities, and they actually bear the expenses of their maintenance. They have established good relations between the various races and the British Government. Considering all these, I think that India should retain possession of the civil administration of Aden. And it is to the best interests of ot India and Aden that it should be linked either with the Government of n 1 a or with the Government of Bombay. That is all I have to say, Sir. I support the Resolution so ably moved by the Honourable Sir Phiroze Sethna. *The Honourable Mr. HOSSAIN IMAM (Bihar and Orissa. Muhammadan) : Sir, first of all I wish to congratulate the Governmen 011 ® correct attitude they have taken up in this matter.

One wonders what will happen to the otne^ territories which are not coming into the federation. I wou re that there is Chitral, there is Thai and the trans-border territories about whicti the White Paper is silent. The Honourable the PRESIDENT: The Honourable Memberwi confine himself to the question under discussion. The Honourable Mr. HOSSAIN IMAM: I ftSn State these have not been treated either as part of Britis n ^ category of a and in a similar manner, Aden, even if it does not c0 ^ 1 rq e y{ r , Basu has province or a State, could be fitted in, just as t e q logical result pointed out, like the Andamans has been fitted m. men t. jf that should have been that Aden should have been aliowe se 6 ^ 0 f t i ie Legisla- position had been placed before the House, I thm ' e T we find it today, lures and the Indian public would not have been so „ ^ . g quoted simply kr the transfer of Aden from ourselves to the Co onia ^ ^ not personally towards easing the difficulties of the British Governnm ^^ p resen t moment, think that the British Government has any difhcu y. p ave a t the The real control v/hich they want is military con ro • ] ja g pointed out, present moment, and, as the Honourable Sir inroze ^ ^ - n con trol of the122 COUNCIL OF STATE.

The position of Aden, the Settlement and the mumci - pality, is that it is of no extraordinary importance from the British point of view except as a coaling station for ships, and as a place where the garrison for guarding the Protectorate is kept. For theseHwo purposes they can utilise Aden even if it is under the Government of India, because we are merely concerned with the trade and civil administration of Aden. Our interest and those of Great Britain do not clash. We have been told of the probable saving of Rs. 20 lakhs. As my Honourable friend Mr. Mehrotra has pointed out, that Rs. 20 lakhs dwindles down to Rs. 14 lakhs according to the figures that were given the other day by the Government themselves. The military expenditure was only- Rs. 14 lakhs last year. Great Britain used to bear the whole of the military expenditure of Aden before the War. First of all, we were paid £72,000 as a contribution from His Majesty’s Government towards the garrisoning of Aden. After that we had an agreement by which two-thirds of the military expenditure was debited to the Imperial Exchequer and one-third to the Indian Exchequer. This was made not with the consent of the people of India. It was decided by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government in England. To argue that because Great Britain had exacted from us the full expenditure in the beginning and one-third of it now therefore they have got any legal or moral right to it is bad logic. We, on our part, do not require to maintain that army for the safety of the Settlement of Aden. That army is kept there for the safety of the Protectorate, and for the safety of the trade route. That is an Imperial consideration. We have been asking times without number that the expenditure on defence debited to India is not based on equity. As a matter of fact, Great Britain ought in justice to defray all the cost of the military in Aden irrespective of whether the civil administration remains under the sway of the Government of India or the Colonial Office. For police duty, a small force will be quite sufficient to safeguard the interests, and it is no argument that we will save money, because there is no real saving. There is a strong suspicion in our minds. Why should a Government, which has always been so careful to safeguard its economic interests, come out of its way all of a sudden and seek to shoulder all the burden of this expenditure when it did not do so in the beginning ? The Honourable Sir N. Choksy has read out Mr. Winston Churchill’s opinion in 1921. Probably the British Government was prepared to take over Aden only on condition that India should continue to pay her quota of the expenditure. Now, all of a sudden, the nation of shop keepers is walling to take up a losing concern. It would be insulting the intelh- gence of ihe English people if I thought it was going to be a losing concern. As the figures pointed out by my Honourable friend Mr. Mehrotra have shown, t e expenditure is going dowai and the income is going up, and the military expenditure is also on the down grade. This shows that people who have got a far sight see at not a very distant future some better prospects in Aden. There; fore it will be unwise, after having spent so much money in the development of the town itself to hand it over to the Colonial Office. ‘One thing about the Colonial Office which strikes India with terror is its attitude of complete cal lousness towards the interests of the natives. In all the Colonies of Great Britain we find that the natives are in a very bad condition. Take the case of Australia, there are no natives remaining there. In South Africa we fmaFUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 123 ee wteiete lei, ihinlsoHls^ [ajestjsw® exacted ti® :; a3kin?t®« r - alOffi«' W ) reals®!;/ m tat InetW;; ide»[4 ■¥*- In** that the natives are very badly treated. The Colonies are meant primarily for the well-being of the nationals of England and we have a very bitter experience of our brethren in Natal, Kenya and other places. To be forewarned is forearmed. His Majesty’s Government are the 'masters. They can do anything they like, but they cannot compel us to be willing partners to a deal in which we see nothing but loss to India, loss of prestige, economic loss as well as sentimental loss. Sir, one thing which strikes me is the strong statement which Sir Denys Bray made in the Assembly in 1929. He is still in the Council of the Secretary of State for India. I hope. Sir, that at least he has argued the point with the Secretary of State and has borne out the w T ords he used here : “ I hasten to add that all idea of such a transfer has long since been abandoned ”. If Sir Denys Bray has not done so till now, let us hope that it is not too late for him to make amends. The transfer of Aden is called for more as a measure of precaution than as a measure of necessity 7 . I think the reason for esiring its transfer is that the British Government has no trust in the future _ ment which is going to be established in India. If they could fee interests of the British Empire would not be jeopardised by the uturc ^ ® ment of India they would I am sure consent to let Aden remain a par o • I wish to assure the British Government that the interests of Trea n a not he unsafe in the hands of the Legislatures in India, because \.e ia ^ i „ more by alienating the sympathies of the British Governroen an ^ . we can inflict on them. In my opinion, Sir, this is a most mopp° r un to lave brought up this idea of transfer. People have been exasp ^ ^ account of the delay in framing the new reforms. G\er ^ ofp nervous- dismemberment of parts of the Indian Empire is beginning o cre.^ ness. L ith these few words, Sir, I support the amendment.

STEWART (Commerce Secretary): beg to move : “ That this Council do signify its opinion in pursuance of sub-section (2) of section 670 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (57 and 58 Viet. Ch. GO) that the dues imposed by the Order in Council of His Majesty, dated the 17th December, 1931, in respect of the hght- houses and buoy specified in the Schedule thereto ought to be levied in British India. This, Sir, is a somewhat unusual motion and with your permission I shall try to explain its significance. The lighthouses and the buoy referred to are situated in the West Indies in the vicinity of Bahamas and the Leeward Islands. These lights were built many years ago at the expense of the British Govern ment at a time when the West Indian Colonies concerned could not themselves raise the necessary funds. Since then the cost of maintaining the lights has been borne by the General Lighthouse Fund, a fund which derives its revenue from light dues collected in the ports of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. The cost has therefore hitherto been borne by the generalmass of shipping using the ports of the British Isles and there has been no specific levy of light dues on the ships which actually derive benefit from these lights. In time these lights have become obsolete and in the past few years a scheme for their improvement has been in progress. This scheme will involve a consi derable increase in maintenance costs and it was felt by His Majesty s ^ over ^ ment that the time had arrived when the ships which actually got the bene of the lights should contribute towards the cost of their upkeep. Tne le\y o Colonial light dues in respect of lighthouses—such as these in question on t e coasts of any British Colony is governed by section 670 of the Merchant Shipp ing Act, copies of which I think are in the hands of Honourable Members. Under that section His Majesty, by an Order in Council, may fix the dues to e paid in respect of ships deriving benefit from such lights, and when an order has been made the dues at once become leviable everywhere throughout is Majesty’s Dominions. In virtue of this power, and with the full approval of the shipping interests mainly concerned, an Order in Council was made on the December, 1931 which fixed the dues to be paid in respect of the Bahamas lig s at one penny per ton 'Of registered tonnage and at the rate of one half-penny per ton m respect of the Leeward Islands light. The Board of Trade have now asked for the cooperation of the Government of India in the collection of these dues at Indian ports. These light dues will be leviable on any ship which may have incurred a liability by deriving benefit from the lights in the course of its J 0 yage to India, or on any ship which will incur such a liability on leaving n * or a oreign port. The Government of India are prepared to cooperate an o ma ve^ airangements to collect through the Customs authorities any dues ^ a may oe leviable from ships arriving in Indian norts, but in order to legahsejhis umoYe, m was a Us •• p i0 Mffliaercewi] if ,. irom ships arriving in Indian ports, but in order to legalise co ec mn it is necessary, in accordance with the terms of sub-section G) ® section 670 of the Merchant Shipping Act, that the Indian Legislature shoul ^ 1 S ? onsen G an d this consent may convenientlv be expressed in the or ot the motion now standing in my name if accepted by both Houses of the Legis- a ure. n recommending this motion for acceptance I would point a e proposa to collect light dues in respect of Colonial lights is not wit ouLEVY IN BRITISH INDIA OF DUES IN RESPECT OF LIGHTHOUSES, ETC. 125 ■cefar II, in raMfi, our pern iel nen igtfewy® 15 wn, t- s,aD(i^. ptere^'i' nrecedent.

His Majesty s Government have recently received representations from different communities among the inhabitants of Aden as well as from certain quarters in India ex pressing their various views in regard to transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Gov ernment of India in connection with impending constitutional changes. Full opportunity will be given for discussion in the Indian Legislative Chambers at their next session and for all interests concerned to state their views. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenient that the considerations which suggest the desirability of a trans fer of the administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer should be made known, so that the problem can be discussed with full knowledge of the facts. The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India under the new constitution are that it is an area geographically remote from India ; that it would not naturally fit into the new federation ; that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it should be decided that the ad ministration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following conditions would be established : (1) India would be relieved of the annual contribution of approximately £150,000 sterling or rupees twenty lakhs at present payable towards the military and political administration. (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained. (3) His Majesty’s Government would maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place.

TRUE to their word, the Government allowed the Council of State an opportunity to discuss the pro blem of Aden before the transfer of its administrative control to the Colonial Office takes effect. ^ The discussion showed how strongly public opinion is opposed to the proposed separation of Aden from this country. An advantage authoritatively claimed for it is that it would relieve Indian revenues of an annual charge of Rs. 20 lakhs on account of the political and military administration of Aden. Sir Phiroze Sethna, who took the lead in voicing Indian sentiment, had little difficulty in showing how what was advertised as actual saving would be found in practice to dwindle down to only a half of it^; for the contemplated non-association of Aden with India would deprive the latter of about ten lakhs which she now receives by way of the proceeds of different taxes collected from the residents of ^/f 1 - But apart from this question of financial relief to India, there can be no doubt that justice will be made more costly to the people of Aden on its transfer to the Colonial Office by reason of the fact that judicial appeals, instead of having to come to Bombay as at present, would have to go to the British Governmen . Moreover, there is an unmistakaoly deep-seated suspicion based on the differential treatment that is being meted out to Indian nationals m some parts of the British Empire that the lot of Indians m Aden will be made more difficult—a suspicion which the categorical assurance of the ^ Government about not tolerating any racial discrimination in Aden has done nothing to allay.

I'l 9 SEP 1933 Cutting from issue dp^ed THE BARREN ROCKS OF ADEN. Aden is one of the places on this earth about which it is hard to find anybody to say a good word for it after personal expeiience. Since the British occupied it in 1839, thousands of Englishmen, Welsh men, Irishmen and Scots have spent a time there, and few of them were re luctant to leave or ever wanted to get back. Its usefulness follows from its being used as a coaling station for British naval and mercantile ships on the way to India. Australia and New Zealand. But it was only some twenty years after the first occupation that the British Government seriously decided that Aden had any practical use, and then they decided that they might have Perim as well, as another coaling station. Since 1857 both stations have been under the control of the Bombay Presidency Go vernment, or, to be more precisely ac curate, were, until the Indian Legislature was set up; not that it matters a great lot which Indian Government exercises dire.ct control over the possessions. Aden, however, promises to be a bone ) of contention in the near future between I India and England, for under the new i Indian Constitution it is proposed to i transfer the administration from the 1 Government, of India completely to the i British Government. But the Indian ! Legislative Assembly has now unani- 1 mously condemned the proposal, with the official members abstaining from the division. To many this will appear a mere piece of nationalist ebullience this desire to retain hold of a settlement many hundreds of miles away from Indian soil which contains only a tiny minority of Indians. Perhaps history has something to say to this anxiety to hold the station, which, as every schoolboy with an atlas should know, commands the entrance to the Red Sea. It is one of the great strategical points of the world, a centre of entrepot trade and a great coaling and oiling station. Its possession is of im mense value to a trading country. Though nominally under the administra tion of the Bombay Government, it owes its importance directly to Britain. Just around the time that the administration passed to the Government of India, British control was tightened up through the Colonial Office. The latter has been, and is, responsible for military and poli tical control, and the Governments of Under the new scheme a unitary control of Aden will be very desirable, if not necessary. The new Constitution will give India Dominion status, or the next thing to it. The Colonial Office must have learned by now that Dominions are very jealous of their powers and rights, and are disposed to kick over the traces if London grows too curious about their administration. Indeed, under the Statute of Westminster, London has no right whatever to interfere in their con cerns. Aden is essential to British trade. It is a free port, which is an adequate reason for the Arabs wishing it to remain in British hands. If the political control of Aden were to pass over to India there would be the danger always present that the Indian Government would differen tiate amongst the nationalities using the port. On the other hand, the Parsee merchants using Aden profess to see a danger of discrimination against them if Aden remains in British hands. The Arabs, to whom Aden should belong if control of it be changed at all, do not see any danger in it remaining a purely British possession. All they want is that Aden should remain a free port for their merchandise, and they trust the British more than they trust the Hindus. The British Government, through Sir Samuel Hoare, have guaranteed the continued freedom of the port to Indian nr.d Arab traders alike, but Indian nationalism is not satisfied. It seeks control of a terri tory to which it has no right whatever. The Indian residents of Aden, nearly all trade importations, number about one in ten of the population, but they form a wealthy and influential section. With the Arab satisfied to leave Aden in the hands of the British, there are little grounds for any change, least of all hand ing it over to the control of the new Indian Legislature. The transfer of the civil administration to Britain will save India £150,000 a year, but we all know that filthy lucre will not influence exalted nationalism. Still, when the Arabs, who have a greater natural claim than any other people, are satisfied, it must be difficult to justify the Indian demand. Bombay and India for civil administra tion. It was only in 1931 that the civil administration was finally transferred to the Government of India and the Bombay influence terminated. The reader may well ask how amity, or ever a working understanding, was maintained amongst all the controlling interests. Probably the reason was the overwhelming influence of the London authorities. Civil, military and political controllers do not always see eye to eye.Notes. Minute Paper. SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Rec. 19 Date. Initials. SUBJECT.

As prima facie they are opposed in toto to the transfer, they do not even by implication reconcile' themselves to the inevitable by criticising the terms or by arguing for more liberal conditions Letter from the Secretary, Imperial Citizenship Association, to the Govern ment of Bombay, dated the 18th August 1933. I am desired by the Council of this Association to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 9510-B., dated the 25th July 1933, and to convey their thanks to the Government of Bombay for affording them an opportunity of expressing their views on the proposal of the transfer of Aden from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. You are aware that many deputations have waited from time to time upon His Excellency Lord Willingdon, and his predecessors in office, in order to convey to the Government of India and through it to His Majesty’s Government, the intense feeling of resentment that have been aroused in the minds of the people of India and the residents of Aden at the proposed transfer of Aden from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. Aden was captured by Major Baillie in 1839 and ever since its administra tion has been carried on at the cost of the Indian Exchequer. The Government of India encouraged Indian merchants to develop the trade and industry of the newly acquired territory of the Indian Empire. The merchants and the Indian public always believed that Aden would ever remain a part of India. This belief was only natural for well over eighty years no move on the part of the Government was made to indicate their intention of transferring Aden, at any time to His Majesty’s Government. It was this belief that led the Indian merchants to develop the “ Barren Rocks of Aden ” to its present state. The population of Aden at the time of its annexation was hardly 3,000 and to-day it is about 53,000. A reference to the trade returns will convince any one ot the magnificent part which the Indian enterprise has played for about a century now, in the development of Aden. The Indian merchants have also been the torch bearers of civilisation amongst the indigenous inhabitants ^ fnd da adjoining territories and these tribes are now reckoned among the most loya subjects of His Majesty. This fact has redounded to the prestige of the British Empire. The controversv regarding the transfer of Aden goes back to 1921, when on the 28th of February, the Prime Minister stated in ^sopoSa that the responsibility for administration and policy i &gt; geotember and Aden was to be transferred to the Colonial Office On ^Sio,! 1921, the Hon’ble Mr. (now Sir) Pheroze Sethna moved the following lesomu.n in the Council of State :— “ This Council recommends to the f “ r j^^fiuhe administra- tion o? Aden be coined under the Government of India and not be transferred to the Colonial Office. Speaking on the resolution, the Hon’Me Mr. Pratt, LGS., expi esse i e view s of the Government of Bombay in the following ' . “ Mr. President, the transfer of Aden to ^fi^anLlosely interested, in which the Government of Bombay is deeply anddos Towards that question the attitude ot and I have cannot under any circumstances provisional views of the been authorised to g! ve discussion of this question.

I must say the Honourable Sir Dinshaw Wacha entirely misunderstood the posi tion The Honourable Mr. Bray clearly stated that the position of Government with regard to this Resolution was one of benevolent neutrality He did not justify, or advocate the proposed transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office. Now, m military and diplomatic language, the meaning of the expression ‘ benevolent neutrality ’ is very well understood. Bearing in mind the meaning of that expression I can assure the House that the Government of India will take note of the opinions expressed in this House by various Members representing different interests. They will note the fact that Indian sentiment, according to the various speakers, is entirely opposed to this transfer. They will also take note of the fact, which has been positively stated by the Honourable Mr. Sethna and is endorsed by the Bombay Government that local opinion in Aden as well as in Bombay is also opposed to the transfer. They will further take note of the fact stated by the Honourable Rai Bahadur Lala Ram Saran Das, that, in view of the position which Indians at present occupy in different parts of Africa—parts that are under the control of the Colonial Office—Indians would prefer that Aden—their brethren, their countrymen, residing and trading in Aden—should remain under the control of the Govern ment of India rather than that Aden should be transferred to the control of the Colonial Office. All these sentiments which have been expressed in the various speeches, delivered by Honourable Member to-day will, the House may rest assured, be carefully borne in mind by the Government of India. The Government of India have not yet pronounced in favour of this transfer, and until they do, no Honourable Member has any right to assume that they are in favour of that proposition. Their position is, as announced by the Honourable the Foreign Secretary, one of benevolent neutrality towards the Resolution moved by the Honourable Mr. Sethna. They prefer to leave this Resolution to the vote of the House. The Official Members will take no part in the voting and Government will un doubtedly pay due regard to find verdict of this House upon the Resolution moved by my Honourable friend. There was one observation in the speech of the Honourable Mr. Froom with reference to which I should like personally to say a few words. He said that the hands of the Government of India were full with Indian affairs and in consequence the Commercial affairs of Aden nad not been so well looked after as they might have been. Well, ^ J 36 . lev W hands of the Colonial Office are not less full with ail airs than those of the Government of India. That argument, I believe, will carry no weight whatever with those who know how ?| 1 iX1 m U - i the Colonial Office is with affairs in the Near East, A, 0 ^ iddle h^ast, the Colonies—and in fact in various parts of the j ( ’ )e ‘ .^hnt is the position as I have stated, of the Government of W'th regard to this Resolution, and the Resolution is to be lett to the vote of the non-official Members. ,, The Council of State adopted Mr. Pheroze Sethna’s Resolution.

This statement surprised the Legislature and the Government of India was severely criticised in both Vt !,, 1 of the Indian Legislature It was considered a clear breacH^ in the tirst place, when the transfer of the military and political administration was effected m ld.W as a temporary War measure, it was given to understand that when the emergency did not exist status quo would be resumed and secondly because it was decided without consulting the Indian Legislature However in’ the said announcement the Commander-in-Chief also stated : ‘‘As Honourable Members are aware, the Settlement of Aden itself is peopled to a very great extent by our fellow Indian subjects ^ The Government of India have thought it right that their welfare and interests should not go outside the ken of the Government of India It will accordingly be retained that part of the Settlement and the Municipality of Aden will remain under the Government of India.” There can be no difference of opinion that the Commander-in-Chief in the above-quoted words, assured Indians that the Settlement and Municipality of Aden, which means civil administration, would remain under the Government of India. Speaking in the Bombay Legislative Council on the 10 th March 1927, on the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Bill, the Hon Tie Sir Earnest Hotson, the then Home Member, said :— “ Since the Bill was introduced, the situation has been materially changed by the announcement made by His Excellency the Comraander-in- Chief at Delhi that the question of the future arrangements for the administration of Aden has been settled by agreement between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. That announcement came as a surprise to the Government of Bombay as much as to the general public. I am obliged to stress this point, because during the discussion on the Bill both J and my honourable friend, the Chief Secretary, assured several honourable members that we had no reason to suppose that a decision was imminent, and indeed pointed to the fact that the Government of India has instructed us to proceed with this Bill as evidence that no immediate change was probable. The details of the future system of admin istration at Aden are not yet known to the Government of Bombay, which indeed knows nothing further than what has appeared in the press.” On January 1929, Sir Denys Bray stated in the Legislative Assembly : aourahle 'tosayafff f India we ti •cial affairs «ij hthavete ■e not 1 ® ^ _ That a# hose ^0 p 1 - rsinthe^; various P^; if the i Besdnti® 1 ' “ I repeat my promises that the transfer of Aden from India will not be effected without this House being taken into consultation. I haste,i to add that all idea of such a transfer has long since been abandon ed. ” _ . The Council submit that the Government of India gave definite assurance in the above-quoted words of Sir Denys Bray that Aden would ever remain a pai. of India. In 1931, the Civil Administration of Aden was transferred to the Goyernment of India. The Indian, Arab and Jew residents of Aden protested agmnst -icn a transfer because, among other things, they feared that it was ^ ■. t „ towards the transfer of control to the Colonial Office. A represtn rLf tion led by Sir Chunilal Mehta waited on H. E. the Viceroy on e . _ 1 ‘, 1931, with a view to lay before His Excellency the views of Aden meicha-ffs.

Sir Samuel Hoare, in the course of his rLlv was sympathetic towards Indian aspiration. But he referred to the v£- n Annmdino- Aden in a Federation which consisted of Provinces, which ItTwL Lt At tL same time he said that that difficulty was not insurmount- S.l3l0 The Government of India issued a communique on the 19th June 1933, stating that the question of the transfer of Aden was receiving the consideration rf ffis Male tv’s Government. They also enumerated m the communique con- sfderations \vhich suggested the desirability of the transfer of the Administration of Aden. . ...... The main point raised in the communique is that Aden being geographically remote Zm India it would not naturally fit into the new Federation Ihe Council beg to submit that it is curious that the remoteness of Aden, whidi is 5 000 miles from England and 1,500 miles from India, occurs to the Government only after a century when it has grown to be a prosperous trading centre It was left to be linked with India so long as it was a deficit unit of admi^tratioii and needed Indian resources in men and money for its development.^ Hie con tention that Aden would not naturally fit into the new Federation is not eon- vincino- As a matter of fact it will far more easily fit into the Federation as a part of the Bombay Presidency, with which it is connected m various ways than in the administration of the Colonial Office. Moreover Sir Samuel Hoare, the Secretary of State, has already stated that this is not an insurmountable difficulty. On more than one occasion, Arabs and Jew residents of Aden have supported the view of Indians that they have been happy under the Indian administration and wish to remain under the Government of India. If a refrendum was o e taken on this point in Aden itself, the inhabitants would unanimously vote for the connection with India. The Council submit this point to the consideration of the Government with all the emphasis at their command. Indians shed their blood along with other loyal subjects of the King-Emperor for the freedom °f fj 16 world. When the victory was won, the freedom of the world was secured.^ Ihe main consideration that has decided the post-war politics hinges on £ elt ' determination ”. The Council humbly submit that the residents of Aden have as much claim to self-determination as any one in the world. Accordingly, n(&gt; change in the present state of Aden should he made without their consent. The fact that Aden is already to some extent under the Imperial control is no justification for depriving India of this valuable territory. Justice demands that the military and political administration which was taken over by the British Government during the war as a temporary measure and was made permanent in 1927 without consulting the Indian Legislature, which was a clear breach of pledges, ought now to be restored to India. The Government of India’s communique further states that in the event of Aden being transferred to the Colonial Office, India should he relieved of the annual contribution of twenty lakhs of rupees that this country is at presen paying towards the maintenance of the Aden fortress. The Council humbly submit that India has been paying this amount for the safety of trade routes to East and South Africa, Ceylon, British Malaya and Australia and that it should heave been an Imperial Charge, to which all the Colonies should have contributed, it, however, Aden is taken away from India, the British Government should1011111)11186 India for the loss it has incurred during the ninety-five years at the rate of twenty lakhs a year at least, though for some years India’s contribution was about fifty lakhs or more annually. UU011 As a reward for services in the Great War, South Africa, Australia and r Dominions have been allotted etr-enemy’s territories far other Dominions have been allotted em-enemy’s territories for administration under the guidance ot the League of Nations and it is really very disappointino- to India that not only that it has not been given any territory but that it is now proposed to deprive it of the country which it rightly and jiistly claims belongs to it. It must also^ be remembered that Aden being a distributing port for all kinds of merchandise to Arabian, African and even Iraq provinces, Indian produce such as w heat, giains, rice, etc., and tea, gunnies, piecegoods, etc., from the ports of Karachi, Bombay, Malabar, Calcutta and even Chittagong, Akyab and Rangoon has been imported there by Indians for many many years and this trade and market have been established by Indians at enormous cost. The trade of Aden now amounts to several crores annually. In these days when every Government is striving hard to capture markets for its produce and trade, and is trying to establish trade commissioners and trade agents for the promotion of trade, and v T hen trade treaties are being concluded, it is the bounden duty of the Government of India not to be unmindful of the grave loss it would cost to India if Aden was lost. At any rate the public of India with so much depreciation in the value of their agricultural produce and consequent poverty would never agree to the separation of Aden from India. The Council humbly submit that under no circumstances Aden should be handed over to the mercy of Colonial Office. India has had very bitter experience of the Administration of the Colonial Office. The treatment meted out to our countrymen in Kenya, Fiji and elsewhere under its control does not augur well for the future of His Majesty’s Indian subjects in Aden. The Council request the Government to realise their feeling when they humbly submit that in spite of the assurance of the Government of India, the right of equal citizenship will he denied to His Majesty’s Indian subjects whenever the interests of the white settlers conflict with those of British Indians. It deeply grieves the Council to find that a country which is developed by the enterprise of Indians is being snatched away from them and is marked down for the settlement and benefit of those who have played n ? P a V f development. The population of Aden consists chiefly of Arabs, Indians and Jews The Europeans of Aden number hardly one hundred, of which about a dozen are English, S they are merely temporary residents carrying on trade as shipping and coaling agents. £ .i ^ The country had been assured on several occasions that ^^Legislature, transfer of Aden would not he decided without consu mug 1 ^ ^ j ndia &amp; but they The Council never doubted this assurance of the assura iice that all those submit that what India really requires ^ ia t their wishes and who are concerned will he consulted, but an assurance opinion will he respected. „ „ . , • fppiino- In the end the Council beg the administration and save Indian Trade and industry' at i en . i u , ar yf e ]t gratitude but also a of Colonial Office and thus ensure Co J of BritLh rSe firm faith in the beneficience and righteous TTA-RArm to the Government Letter from the Buvers and SaimNO ham^ A ^ gT yggs. on Bohuav, No. G.C-13,81, n ^ ^ July 19 3 3&gt; _ as With reference to your letter No^ 9olU-i&gt;.,^e the hollour to submit views desired by the Committee of my Chamb , as follows Question of transfer of Mv Committee have always f^f a d there always lurked a fear, a control of the Civil Administration of Aden a of my Committee, brd right apprehension, and suspicion no ^ • organisations of this com J L also in the minds of all the trade and comm ^ concerned in the mid all sections of the inhabitants of Civ il Administration of Aden that any talk regarding transfer of contro^ was never conducive to the best • des irable for all times, felt that status quo would be the bes iip tpv the Viceroy on oOt i When the Aden Deputation f 6 *.

And with what fateful rapidity do their fears seem to be matenahsmg now that the ideate proposal is brought forward to wipe off the only Colonial part of ‘the Indian Empire ! „ , „ Mv Committee are thankful to the Government for still there is a chance . .77 Halt ’ to the proposed move. They only wished that the Govern- men? should 1 ve gtoti aVonger assurance to the effect that the proposal wo d never be carried into effect unless it is voted by a large majority of he T,A an Members of the Legislative Assembly ; and my Committee fee sure that if the Indian opinion is to be the desideratum, the proposal can never be carried. Tt has been stated in the Government Press Communique that the reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India under the New Constitution are that— ( 1 ) it is an area geographically remote from India ; that (2) it would not naturally fit into the New Federation ; that ( 3 ) it is already to some extent under Imperial control ; and that ( 4 ) it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate which has passed wholly out of Indian control. My Committee respectfully beg to submit that these are not the reasons that bring home conviction to the Indian mind. It is true that Aden is, remote from India • but at the same time it is also true that it is the remotest from the seat of the Empire. It is a matter of great surprise to my Committee that such a reason is advanced now after a century-old connection of Aden with the Bombay Presidency. The second reason falls short of least conviction. Why should Aden not fit into the new Constitution on anvil ? No reasons are ascribed in the Press Communique for obvious reasons, and my Committee cannot understand the object of His Majesty’s Government in placing such a flimsy reason in favour of a proposal which is calculated to hurt very vitally the entire Indian hiation who feel themselves most concerned in all the problems of Aden. As regards the reason (3), a fundamental fact cannot be forgotten that during the World War, the military and political administration of the port of Aden was temporarily taken over by the British Government, and when the exigencies of War were over, the British Government were duty-bound to restore military and political administration of Aden to India. They had no right to usurp this Administration permanently when it was manifestedly taken over as a temporary measure ; and in view of this therefore the third reason also cannot stand. The fourth and last reason also is considered unsubstantial in view of what is stated above. Now as regards the conditions contemplated to be established in the event of the transfer, my Committee view them as a bait with purpose to sever India permanently from Aden. Whatever the conditions, experience is too vivid in the Indian mind as to the plight of Indians under Colonial Government. Aden is a defence port of India, which the Government of India can id- afford to give up under any circumstances. A hundred years ago it was cap tured by Indian troops. For sixty long yeans it was maintained to a very large degree by the rate-payers '-of the Bombay Presidency and to less extent t&gt;y the rate-payers of the Central Government, and in later years the Civil Administra tion of Aden has become self-supporting. After years of endeavour and enter- pnso it lias been made what it is to-day by Indian people with Indian money. ^ 11 captured, it had hardly a population of 3,000 whilst it is now about A 1 A Its prosperity is almost entirely due to Indians, The vast trade ot r ( . ei /’ ^ 10 three large^ Salt Works, other industrial concerns at Aden and the rue coastal steamship line at Aden and the shipping piers at Aden belong, mostly to Indians.It is a distributing port for all kinds of merchandise to Arabian African and even Iraq provinces. The Indian produce, such as wheat, gram, rice, etc and tea, gunnies, piece-goods, etc., from the ports of Karachi, Bombay, Malabar’ Calcutta and even Chittagong, Akyab and Rangoon are being imported there bv Indians since many years, and this trade and market have been established by Indians at an enormous cost and personal sacrifices. The Indians have established themselves there ; they have made Aden their home with no fore thought that it would ever be snatched away from the control of Indian Govern ment. These are the weighty facts against the transfer, and Indian interests in Aden demand that it should ever be with the Indian Government. A century- old connection makes Aden inseparable from India, and the proposal simply aims at, my Committee beg to submit with all emphasis at their command, in capacitating India by chopping off what is a most vital part of India. Aden is of such importance to India from defence as well as trade points of view. My Committee firmly believe that it is not at all a wise policy to entertain such a proposal in flagrant disregard of the wishes of the governed. It is therefore very earnestly requested that the Government of India on behalf of the Indian people will resist with all the strength at their command the proposed transfer, and make every effort to see that Aden is retained with them. If however the Government of India are forced to surrender the control in spite of all possible resistance my Committee would further request without the least pre judice to their opinion given above, that the Government of India must demand in all fairness the full recompense from His Majesty’s Govern ment for ail the money with compound interest thereon, spent by the rate-payers of the Bombay Presidency and the Indian Government m Public Works depart ment and other Departments of Aden Administration from commencement till date and also a recompense for transfer itself with the explicit condition tha all rights and privileges hitherto enjoyed by the Indians m Aden shall be con tinued to be enjoyed by them for all times. lETTER FROM TILE GRAIN MERCHANTS’ ASSOCIATION, TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY, DATED THE 19tH AUGUST lyoo.

Previous Papers Initials. SUBJECT. Separation of Aden . Debate In Council of State. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. Please see previous submission on P.Z.4198/33 flagged below. The text of the press comnunique issued by the Governnent of India with a view to focussing discussion a nd leading up to a debate in the Assembly is also flagged. Hie Acting Chief Commissioner’s despatch of 15th July, No. C.403, on P.Z. 4654/33, gives the Arab reactions. (As will be seen the local Arabs are chiefly apprehensive of Indianisation and could they but be satisfied as regards it would probably have no very strong feeling in favour of transfer from India. The Government of India have been authorised to contradict the rumour referred to by Mr. champion that the annual contribution 5041 2000 1.31V I - 2 - r if of 20 laks of which India would he relieved in the event of separation would he imposed on the revenues of Aden). 2 . The question was debated in the Council of State yesterday and the extract from the Times attached gives a full discussion. It will he seen that the 9st»«l Members remained neutral (no doubt on the ground that the object of the aiscussion was to elicit the views of Indian politicians and Indian interests) but the effect of this is probably reflected in the unsatisfactory character of the division. There is no justification for the suggestion that a guarantee was given either in 1929 or 1922 that all question of the transfer of aden had been abandoned. All that was said on the most recent occasion^ was that the transfer of responsibility for the civil administration of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India would not in any way prejudice the position as regards its transfer in the future to the Colonial Office. 3. There is nothing in the Times report to suggest that the question of salt was debated at any length (though sir Phiroze Sethna took the point, which is a good one, that India would lose a certain amount of revenue in respect of income tax, salt, etc.) The line which the Government of India propose to take on this point is set out in their telegram of 31st august, No.2132, on P.Z.5456/33 attached. /•s * &lt;t17l 2n 5000 3/33 rejection/ Minute Taper- Department. 4# It is perhaps not improtahle that the dehate in the Legislative Assembly will follow much the same line as the debate hi the Council of State, in which event it will ultimately be necessary for H.lw.G. to take the line that after full consideration of the views expressed in the debates in question they have decided in favour of the separation of Aden ana that they are of opinion that Indian interests will be adequately safeguarded by the assurances which have been given. &lt; /- /x *' 3 7 ' The procedure adopted by the G. of I., and their attitude in the Council of State may at first sight seem strange * they move d merely that the j. o 20th June should be taken into consideration (a motion which, even if adopted, would not have committed the Council in favour of separation), and did not oppose ! Sir P. Sethna’s motion against separation (which was I adopted, presumably, without a division). This is according to the ’Times'; we shall get the official report in due course. But no doubt the explanation is that the object of the Govt, motion was to elicit non. official opinion, and that, in accordance with past pledges, the G. of 1. cannot decide their part m the matter prior to discussion in the Legislature. In these circumstances, the procedure which they Lave adop would be preferable to making a substantive nroposa ,rejection of which by the Council would have been much more the decision. We must anticipate that the Legislative Assembly will adopt the same attitude as the Council of State. In view of the G. of I.’s peculiar position resulting from its past pledges, the Govt, spokesmen may not be able to vote or speak against a motion in favour of the retention of Aden in India, but presumably they will be able to reply to the debate to the extent, at any rate, of correGoing any misstatements and misapprehensions. (c/ *7 J Jo *cc. pl.J The ’pledges’ referred to above/; We have traced the following-^ uLu. A 4-. ^ (1) On 26th September, 1921, a resolution was adopted by the Council of State, recommending that the administration of Aden should not be transferred to the Colonial Office. (2) G n 16th January, 1922, Sir Denys Bray, in answer to a question in the Legislative Assembly, stated that the Govt, had no intention of arriving at a decision without giving the Assei#Dly an opportunity for discussion. (3) On 9th June, 1924, in answer to a question in the Council of State, Mr. Thompson stated that ’before a xinal decision is arrived at, the Indian Legislature will be given an opportunity to express its opinion 1 . On 29th January, 1929, Sir D. Bray, in reply to detailed and comprehensive questions in the Legislative Assc; ,oxj, included the statement: ’I repeat my promise that the transfer of Aden from India will not be effected without this House being taken into prior embarrassing. The Legislature has been promised discussion and consultation, but not, of course, a share in consultation/\ 26 o dinute Department. h in no 12k 5000 3/33 consultation. I hasten to add that all idea of such ; transfer has long since been abandoned.' Jo (5) j fflnen the transfer of the civil administration from Bombay to India was under consideration, the Viceroy, with Mr. Howell, received a deputation. Mr. Howell stated that if the question of transfer to H.M.G. should arise again in future, it would have to be considered on its merits, and would be rendered in way either easier or more difficult by the transfer from Bombay to India Meft. proposed; he added that if the proposal to transfer to H.M.G. was raised again, the G. of I. were bound by past assurances that full opportunities for discussion would be given. The Viceroy ernnhatically endorsed Mr. Howell's statement, and undertook that, should the question of transfer to H. M.G. arise in future, all interests concerned would be consulted. Sir P. Sethna, in the Council of State last Thursday, seized on the last sentence of the statement quoted undePWaH?FTut of itlWomeit/. ./hat oir D. Bray meant, of course, was that, since the posuwar controversy regarding Aden had been settled by the decision to transfer the political and military responsibility and allow India to retain civil administration, the question of the transfer o. latter was no longer, in 1929, a live issue; the old oroposal had been abandoned.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 1489 of the 17th June 1933 on the subject of the proposed transfer of the Administration of Aden to the control of His Majesty’s Government. 2. During the past week, a sufficient time having elapsed since the publication of the Announcement on the 20th June 1933, I have invited the opinions of thirteen leading and influential Arabs on this matter, in a aeries of private and informal intervie.. o. «y informants were especially selected as representative of religious (Moslem), comroercial (wholesale, retail and transit trade), and real estate interests m '• en, and they are well qualified to voice the genuine opinion of all classes of the Arab community, owing both to their m comparatively enlightened understanding of the issues ivolved and to their influence over and acquaintance .th the less intelligent attitude of oroe The impression that I have received from less frank and friendly conversations is that the Ara ^■Mafiad and content / mitinnl tv k Art a 8 wrVi 1 a J3 T*under the Minting political and administrative conditions, but that they view with grave misgiving the possibility of Indianiaation* of the government of l Aden consequent upon constitutional changes in India. Representing an overwhelming racial majority in territory that is geographically and historically an integral part of Arabia, they fear the subordination of Arab to Indian Interests, and they forsee an increase in the commercial domination of Indian firms in Aden, if the Settlement is to remain under the control of an increasingly self-governing India, 4. On the other hand, while they are acquiescent in the prospect of transfer and reliant on the honesty of the intentions and purposes of His Majesty's Government, they are characteristics! ly apprehensive of change, and are not confident that that which is now . contemplated will be to their social or material advantage. ka one of my visitors expressed himself, - •fe are warm in this fire. Shall we perhaps be burned in another?*. 5 # The following particular points have eamrged in the course of my conversations in regard to the Announcements- u 6 bazaa bell cont reli are sugg,^ removed by the issue &amp; . rth .r Announcement in this regard. basaar rumour 5 widely further and cl®*? Qr Majesty's Governmental d be Cond,ii is.na understands that :• is3- 8 ktqi unable, at the present — or perhaps at any — juncture, to bind themselves unconditionally to the maintenance of fthe existing ' iscal policy in Aden, there is oneral disappointment that a more definite statement has not been made on these issues. IliaEflUanaauaj- -Heligious circles profess to be preoccupied with the need for the administration of the Sher’ia Law in Aden according to the Shafe'i doctrine, which is followed by practically all the Arab Moslem Community* It appears, however, that Arab opinion generally is satisfied with Indian Law in that respect which follows the Hanafi doctrine; and I think that the contention of the , Ul©ma represents a pious hope for the future, rather than an argument for or against transfer* 6. The publication of the Announcement has had the desired effect of crystallising the issues at stake, and has tended to confine controversy to the conditions with which it dealt; and while it has not prevented the exchange of irresponsible rumours in the bazaars, ih©r#„ is no evidence that these rumours have their source in propaganda directed by (Indian commercial) circles wnich are still uncompromisingly hostile to transfer. 7* The sense of this appreciation has been generally confirmed by official and unofficial observe.,s whom I have consulted in the matter, and W - 10se ftctivitk bring them into close touch with the t.;ao 0 - v Aden, The situation will continue to be closely etched, and developments will be reported to you from time to time. 8- I have addressed copies of this despetch the Secretaries of St»te for India and for the uolonie I have the honour to be, Tour Sir, . moat obedient servant,J &gt; 4 /O tF t—n from Itot l^orei gn Seorst^ry to tbe Go to rm&amp;tnt ot 1 ndia Th« Ciliof Secretary to tn© OoVermont of Bombay, Political and Htfor&amp;t Department Dated Simla, the /fe^Tuiy 1933.

The fact that there seems likely to be a considerable division of opinion as to the case for protection for the Aden salt interests in the Legislature is an additional reason for doing so. 3. On a minor point, paragraph 15 of Sir H.C. Dinshaw*s memorial suggests that a guarantee was given by Lord willingdon at the interview on 30th November 1931 that there need be no misapprehension “as to differential treatment being meted out to Aden salt than that of India.'

I am to say that though it seems possible that a European officer will be available for Aden, it is diifi- cult to guarantee anything at present, especially in view of the fact that as the question is likely oo arise in 1935, the Bombay Government do not see how they can oind its successors.

He has inforaed me that he has heard from a private source in India that the separation of Aden from India is contemplated, and that he therefore called this meeting in the hope of preventing it. I understand that it was attended ty doth Indians and Arabs. I told Er.Pramroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw that I was prepared to forward to Sovernment any considered resolution passed by a representative meeting and I accordingly do so, with my comments. 3 It *11 be seen that the sense of the meeting was opposed to a transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office on J -+i fularly on account of its general grounds, and pa incal salt industry, on post and anticipated effect on e ^ nn itiek cost of admimstratio i telegraph charges, on tr op the method of government.

I trust that the meeting’s fears on other points will prove to be ill-founded, and that it will not be necessary to impose additional burdens on the community. I am of opinion that a change in the control of Aden need not, and ought not, involve any serious alterations in the existing system of administration, at any rate several years; and that new taxation, new laws and a multiplication of new officials should be avoided. An official assurance to this effect would go far to allay misgivings with regard to a possible change of control if His Majesty's Government and the Government of India decide on making one. ifromi - Mr. A ram rose G« Di^ s ^ aw A 17Hi April 19 33.

This meeting also reminds the Government of India of the assurances they gave in the Council of State and prays that the Governor-General will, in the interests of the Arab and Indian citizens of this port take up the same position his Government rightly took up few years back when this question was raised and the step fraught as it is with far reaching consequences to the well-being of the inhabitants of this place will it is hoped not be allowed to be carried out with out consulting the people most concerned and without giving the Indian Legislature an opportunity to examine it in ail its hearings. this meeting requests that the Chief Commissioner of Aden will kindly impress upon the Imperial Government as well as the Government of India that the transfer will be highly detrimental to the interests of Aden.Co•ffTDMTIAL. Copy of a letter Ho.G/2i5-a. from the Chief Commissioner, Aden Government, of India, Foreign and dated the 19th April 1933( * to the Secretary to the Political Department, Simla. Subject: - Future of Aden. I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter which has been addressed to me by a number of the leading Arab residents in Aden on the subject of the possible transfer of the administration of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. Ihis expression of their views is a direct result of the meeting held a few days ago under the auspices of Mr.Framroze Kormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw, which was reported to you in my letter Ho. C/215 dated 18th April 1933. 2. In my opinion the letter represents the real opinion of intelligent members of the Arab community, which, as you are aware, forms the majority of the population of the Settlement of Aden. Tiiey regard with considerable apprehension the possibility of the inclusion of Aden in a self-governing Indian Federation, and the consequent prospect of an India domination over an Arab town. The Aden Arabs are extremely conservative, and they desire as little change as possible in the existing administration of the Settlement, fliis sentiment is expressed under the headings (1) &gt; (2) and (3) in their letter. Of the first, namely the continuance of Aden a- a- f**® 6 po &gt; my opinion, vital to the prosperity of the place, which is based on its transit trade. I understand their heading (4) to refer to their desire that Government posts in Aden should, as far as possible, be filled by local recruitment.TRAN .SLAT I 0 II . Aden, 18th April i 9 33# .

We beg to state that news and rumours about the imminent transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government have of late . greatly increased. The Indians have held a meeting to protest against this transfer. As the Arabs form the majority of the inhabitants of Aden, they are more concerned with this affair than other communities. We therefore think it desirable to express our views in this matter. We declare that we do not object to the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government provided that the present state of affairs will continue, namely (1) that the Port of Aden shall be a free port and exempt from Custom duties and tariffs on exports and imports. ( 2 ) that all taxes and other dues in general shall remain as they are, even if they are not reduced in view of the Wm present financial crisis.

In our telegram of 29th May we suggested the word 'deprecating' for 'protesting against', and stated that we were assuming that the G. of I. had good grounds for saying that representations had been received advocating transfer. Apparently the G. of I.’s original reference to 'advocating' was based solely on the letter to Col.

The formation of opinion at Aden itself is, of coarse, of primary importance. Col.

As soon as the text of this announcement is settled, we can, in telegraphing it to Aden, ask the Resident to keep a careful watch on developments, and report fully from time to time how opinion is shaping, and what real weight is to be attached to all expressions of opinion by the various parties interested.

Reilly’ suggestion of a tariff concession in respect of salt for a limited period of time. Jc*JIndia, under pressure fT«*^ tl\j&amp; consuming provinces, mainly Bengal, ha 7 ^ just reduced the duty on foreign imported salt (i.e. the protection accorded to Aden Salt on the Indian market} from 43 L annas per maund to 'Si.

This preference in favour of Aden salt as against other Empire sources, including Liverpool, is a sore point vita the British industry and was one hf the matters raise., a v,ee.c ago by a deputation to the President of tne Board of Trtde. It seems hardly conceivable that India, nno nas uetui here for including Aden salt in the protection accorded to then home product while Aden was still a part of British ino.ia, should be urged from here to continue, aj. oer^epara , preferential treatment of Aden Salt as against tne rest of Empire. • 4 - -? c? cm arguable point whether As regards Tariff autonomy, it is a - , _ . tt k o. to acqiesce in ie convention could he held to oblige (Muu^ uAl (r** n Aflpn to the detriment of idia/giving preference to a separa L„,„, ««.f » f “• Col “ lsl A, reg A rt , t », real ».«d ^ * ^ reported on Salt recognised ’ailed that the Tariff Loam w i + nroduction without help. fhat Aden could hold its own m -- A. 1 ) 1 X 0 )^ zalftT 7aIton.

Col* Reilly, the Chief Commissioner, who is now on leave in this country, fears that, unless an announcement is shortly made, propaganda against transfer may make great headway at Aden, and may gain many adherents among the Arab population, as well as among Indians, as a result of ignorance of the conditions of transfer to which H.M.G. are prepared to agree. 3, Subject to the views of e I/' HOI 5000’ 11.32 Secy.'sh Samuel Hoare would propose to authorise an announcement in the terns set out xn the G. of I-’s telegram, , ' subject to m alteration*which he has suggested to them in the telegram of which/KI'H/A’Sc i Off T B L 5 0 H A ¥ . }?rom Government of India, Foreign and Political, Department, to {CQVUZS Secretary of State for .India, CXBCtfLATSD) Dated Simla, S2nd May, 1933 0 Beceived 22nd May, 1933, 8 pcin, 1288* Tour telegram of the X5tn instant, 1X96 0 Future administration of Aden a Please see our telegram of the X 6 th instant, 1236 , giving our general (? views on the^ question^ As you will, see 5 we have suggested discussion before Joint- Select Committee as preliminary means of making Icnown the attituds of His Maj e sty 5 s Government 0 If, however, you feel that this is unlikely to give sufficient publicity, we should offer nu objection to an announcement on the i~nas v/ia¥ suggested in our immediately succeeding telegram^ Shis announcement should, in our opinion, be mB.de simultaneously in England, India and Aden* fil a.'ijvh 5 '- to EGRET^ &lt; h Q “ ■;/ r ■' V &gt;' &gt; W / (68 groups) 296.51(63 groups) 1 C '«910 K L 'X $ L B 0 K &amp; M , From Gorernment of India, Foraign / r , n Political Department, to ^cKated) 3eoretary of atat3 i&gt;atsd Simla, 22 m} May, 1933, Received 22 ml May, 1933 , 9.46 p.m. X MSI* gir et of 3 P arte.

One s first reaction is that it is making too much of the Aden question to raise it before the Joint Select Committee in the manner suggested, and to call witnesses on behalf of Indian interests in Aden. Moreover, it is possible (though I am not sure of this) that the implication of the reference to Aden in the White Paper was intended to be that the consideration of the future arrangements would fall outside the scope of the consideration of the White Paper itself. I do not believe that the G. of I. will have much difficulty in making up their mind to agree to separation, but of course they cannot openly regard the question as a nhose jags until they have impler.ented their pledge to A &lt;1«wuttthe Legislative Assembly next % autumn. . - „ r. jj ,H L C A^Aa. ,4 ^14-C^ 1212 5 COO 9.32 t- k* if La, ,rt f , f f sL*, s\&lt;ud ''m ' ^ K The Biggest ion th.t .. rni.o tto »«=■ before the Joint Select Co-ittee i. -.tently impracticable.

Such announcement could be made simultaneously here, and when made it would provide material for answering any questions which may be raised by the Indian delegates to the Joint Select Committee, as well as for replying to other enquiries. The main object of such an announcement is still to prevent agitation against transfer gaining headway in Aden (and also in India) through misconception of what is proposed and ignorance o the very valuable assurances which H.M.G. would be prepar to give. A draft telegram to the G. of !• is submitted. On the question of procedure when once a decisi is taken and announced, it will be seen that the G. of !• recommend taking power to separate Aden by Order in Council, as we originally suggested. The 0. in C. could then be issued any time up to the date of the proclamatio of^federation. Once a decision is taken and known, the actual date within this limit is mainly a matter of convenience; it might be convenient that it diould be later rather than sooner, in order that Aden may continue to enjoy the advantages of the Indian salt regime as long as possible, and long enough, perhaps, for the salt industry at Aden to adapt itself to the loss of this privilege. (Thia ,is a matter to v/hich Col- Reilly/ ed on in U*-j (a* ^ in~~[ ^ illMinute Paper. Department. P hat ly Reilly attaches great importance, as salt is the only local industry; when calling at the 1.0. on 10th and 11th May he said that, failing his recommendation that Aden after separation should be allowed to remain within the Indian salt tariff, he would like, if possible, at least some preferential treatment for her salt in India, or else continuance of the present exemption for a limited period, in order that the Aden industry might have time to adjust itself to the /Cwu' tv-cn change. It is probably illusory^to hope that the Indian authorities would agree to any concession in respect of salt when once Aden is separated.)Extract from a private letter from Mr. Metcalfe dated 29th April, 1933. $ith regard to Aden I quite realize that the decision to effect separation has been irrevocably taken and will have to be implemented before long. Most of the i embers of the Executive Council also realize and approve the decision. But there is some natural reluctance to acknowledge the fact publicly at the present moment both on account of its political reactions and also because of our pledges to consult the Legislative Assembly. I hope to get a telegram on the subject off to you shortly.Draft Paper. Department.

He has informed me that he has heard from a private source in India that tne separation of Aden from India is contemplated, ana that he therefore called this meeting in the nope of preventing it. I understand that it was attended oy Doth Indians and mrabs. I told Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Gowasjee considered resolution passed oy a representative meeting and I accordingly do so, with my comments. 2.

I am ol opinion that a change in the control of Aden need not, ana ought not, involve any serious alterations hi the existing system of administration, at any rate for several yeais, ana tlm/t new taxation, new laws and a multiplication of new officials should he avoided.

Framroze H• C. Dinshaw.resolution. This meeting of Arab and Indian citizens of Aden view with alarm the contemplated transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office, which if carried into effect would not fulfil the pledges given by the Government of Indiathrough its accredited representatives from time to time. The transfer would be highly detrimental to the residents of Aden as they would be cut off from their Indian connection which has proved so far beneficial. The Colonial Government, it is feared, will not be able or willing to look after their welfare as can be expected from India in which they are represented in the legislatures. The salt protection duty of the Government of India has materially helped the salt industry of this place and which will automatically cease to exist immediately her connection with India is severed, ihe bulk of the business is in the hands of Indians to whose wants the Colonial Office cannot show tne same sympathy as can be expected from the present Government. Postage and telegraph rates will also go up automatically. Expend!tur it is feared will bedoubled or even trebled by high paid English Officers being imported direct, as is at present being done in British Somaliland, and to meet which customs and other duties will be levied, to the detriment of the trade of this port which is already dwindling. It is also f-ared tha X • viTr nffpcted by the change as landlords will be materially i foreign to the citizens will different laws and regulations applied to Aden. various Further, this meeting Goverme nt of presentations made by rece ived from dia and the emphatic P™ ^ ^ ^ ^ ag when fferent quarters which now . ^ ^ curi3r i s e to Arab and ey were made.

This meeting also reminds the Government of India of the assurances they gave in the Council of State and prays that the Governor General will, in the interests of the Arab and Indian citizens of this port take up the same position his Government rightly took up a few years back when this question was raised, and the step fraught as it is with far reaching consequences to the well-being of the inhabitants of this place will it is hoped not be allowed to be carried out without consulting the people most concerned and without giving the Indian Legislature an opportunity to examine it in all its bearings. This meeting requests that the Chief Commissioner of Aden will kindly impress upon the Imperial Government as well as the Government of India that the transfer will be highly detrimental to the interests of Aden.COMF1 DEHTI AT, . THE RESIDEKCY, Aden, 19 April, 1933. From Lieutenant-Colonel B.R.Reilly, C.I.S., Chief Commissioner, Aden. To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Subject:- Future of Aden. Sir, I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter which has been addressed to me by a number of the leading Arab residents in Aden on the subject of the possible transfer of the administration of Aden from one Government of India to the Colonial Office. Tnis expression oi their views is a direct result of the meeting held a few days ago under the auspices of Mr. Framroze Honnusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw which was reported to you in my leti-ei o.C/215 ^prii 1933. !. In my opinion the letter represents the real opinion )f intelligent members of the Arab coinnunity, ”-ich, ns you tre aware, foms the majority of theppulation of the Settlement of Aden. They regard with considerable ••u-n-i + v of the inclusion o Aden m a ipprehension the possibility x x- . onrl the consequent prospect self-governing Indian Federatio.i, -of an Indian domination over an Arab town. The Aden Arabs are extremely conservative, and they desire as little change as possiole in the existing administration of the Settlement. This sentiment is expressed under the headings (1), (2) and (3) in their letter. Of these the first, namely the continuance oi nden &amp;.S a free port, is, in my opinion, vital to the prosperity of the place, which is based on its transit trade. I understand their heading (4) to refer to their desire that Government posts in Aden should, as far as possible, be filled by local recruitment. I have, etc. Chief Commissioner.oLxil ION . xien, istli April 1933. To H.E* Colonel Heilly, ^iiief Conjinissioner, Aden. After Complirnents, mere are reports and rurijour of the intending transfer of -men to the Colonial Government. The Inaians have neld c, meeting to protest against this transfer. As the majority 01 the people of Men a re Arabs to whom this question is more important than to any other comirnunity, we thought it better to express our opinion on it. We have no objection to the transier of Aden to trie Colonial Government if (1) the Port will remain free i.e. no tariff will be imposea on exports ana imports, (2) if taxes in general will remain as they are if not reduced having regard to changed conditions, ( 3) if the laws and local rules will remain as they are unless it is considered necessary to alter some of them in the interest of the place, (4) the rights of the people remain as they are, if not improved upon; the people to have a prior right to Government posts ana appointments etc. If this is not possible, Aden may form part of the ’’Reserved Area' i.e. unaer the Governor General ol India. We have confidence in our Governor Colonel Reilly as we consider him to be one of us.

Tne oU arantee s we had secured from the Colonel Office went a long way to meet reasonable apprehensions. The really important point was that aden should continue to be a free port, it was essentially dependent on this for its existence and any suggestion for a change would mobilise against us not only llndian but hrab feeling. The Arab population of Aden, however little affection it might have for Inaia, WO ula much rather stay under Inula if there was any question of I |.import duties being imposed. 3. as regards solvency, if, as he gathered was the case, it was proposed that aaen should retain her own ■income tax, he thought no difficulty need be anticipated unuer tills heaa. Colonel heilly, indeed, thought that tne |amount which would fall to Aden's share might be as much as 6 lukhs a year. 4. Salt was a problem, but while there would no doubt De pressure to keep Aden within tne Indian salt ring from certain quarters^it looked as though the salt interests eflectea would have to take tneir chance. 5. as regards the posting of a^&amp;ropean as Judicial Assistant, Mr. Turner saia that he thought at the moment the difficulties were almost insuperable. Bombay were exceedingly/exceedingly snort of Judicial Officers ana had already t find such an officer for duty at fiajkot. it ml ght in these circumstances he necessary if w e ^ we presoea our point (and he recognised tne strength of the arguments for it) to ask some other province to assist, hut he was inclined to doutt lif the Central Provinces would be able to spare anyone either. 6. i nope to see Lr.

It would seem desirable that the Secretary of State's o£r±64al reply No. 630 of 9th Larch on P.z.1068 diould also be official. I am sorry that this was not covered by the original private telegram. 2 - We are now in a position to telegraph in greater detail a reply to the o,uestions in paragraph 3 of the Government of India's official telegram of 24th January No.215 and a draft, In the terms of which as now amended the Colonial Office concur, is attached. It might he well to emphasise again that the question of separation is for practical purposes closed and that this information is supplied to enable the Government of India to deal with enquiries in the Legislature, etc. and not them 5' ft-urpooo ol*fnalrifle, up their own minus on the general quest ion. 3 .. ihe opportunity is taken to ueal with a minor hut difficult point, viz. the possiole posting of Indians to senior posts at Aden. *rom the last paragraph of the Government of Bombay's express letter of 4th February, on P.Z. 1034/33, it will beseen that | they hint at the possibility that It nay be necessary ^ to replace the present Judicial assistant when his time at Aden is up by an Indian.

The point is one which was previously put to the Viceroy by Lora Birkenhead (see the private correspondence flagged H. and I in file P.3082(28)/17 below,) when Lora Irwin indicated that rt as far as the present is concerned I will see to it that there is no idea of sending an Indian there either as First, Third, or Judicial assistant. As for the remoter future, our successors must, I fear, be left to look after themselves.' 1 It is, of course, particularly undesirable to raise tnis question at a time when we are anxious to secure the concurrence of the Home Departments concerned in the retention of Indian Service personnel at Aden in the period subsequent to separation. On the whole it would perhaps suffice if -Mr. Metcalfe were adoressed as in the secret and personal letter of which a draft is attached.

But reference to the s reached Cabinet was of course inevitable if an answer was to be given to the Government of India's question as to whether the Indian contribution would be remitted in the event of Aden being separated, and it was equally inevitable that a decision on that Question should necessitate examination in principle of the desirability or otherwise of separation. 2* As regards the White Paper, it is, I suggest, essential to make some statement about the future of Aaen. Not to do so would be both disingenuous and dangerous for there would be considerable risk that our position in regard to separation would to some extent be compromised. Moreover, it would presumaoly oe exceedingly difficult to pass over this area alone of all areas of British India without some indication of what our intentions were.

The arguments they adduce against immediate separation will gain in force as time goes on, nor can we safely, I think, trust to the possitoility ttoat for financial reasons an Indian Finance Minister may at some time in ttoe future spontaneously ask for ttoe removal of Aden. O' Sentimental arguments would be likely to outweigh the financial saving (in itself small), if this view is I accepted we toad toetter let tne Government of India know immediately what ttoe attitude of H.M.G. is likely to toe. For their own assistance in dealing with enquiries, etc., they will need to have seme time table to wtoich to work. I attach a draft telegram.

S.W.i.

[salt of 4i annas a maund. ihe natural consequence of the separation of Aden would he that salt from Aden would be treated like other non-Indian salt and cease to enjoy the protection of this differential duty. This deprivation would certainly have a serious effect upon the *den salt industry, in which Indian merchants have important interests. From the information which, has been supplied to the Secretary of State in connection with the general question of the additional import duty on salt, it will be readily seen that the two oldest, firms - one of them Italian and one Indian - will have a fair chance of holding their own in equal competition with salt from other sources outside India; but it is less certain that the two other companies which are not so well established would be able to survive. Even the older fims might, in common with other foreign salt sources, ultimately suffer severe restriction of their business if the policy of protection to the mainland salt industry is maintained and developed; and must be content, in any case, with lower profits than those which they have been making since March, 1931. 4# x t is true that the fims which have established factories in Aden - even those which were more^^rec lis * ed p^^ (Addi ‘ tional import Duty) Act, because the existing factories were all established before Aden salt ceased to compete on equal terms with all other imported salts; and it is believed that the extensions that have taken place since the aou.tTor^l import duty was imposed have been comparatively small, bn viQn + ci who have established ^ +-ho Indian merchants wno u the other hand, the maiaii „ r tories may certainly be expected to three out of the four ^ ^ + 0 + +w Ade n was part of India contributed to claim that the fact th*t Aden P , ace m which to establish their their choice of Aden as a p their „ r if thev survive competition th factories; and, as ev . - nro fits /-3- profit, 111 unaoupfi!, t, greatly r. S „«i, they , m c , rt , lnl , oppose separation or demand some sort of compensation or assistance. Once Aden is separated, India's interest in it will confined to safeguarding the interests of Indians in Aden in the same manner as those of any Indian community overseas, and the question of assisting any important local industry, whether owned by Indians or others, in any way will he a matter for the Government that has taken over the administration of Aden. It is, however, desirable that His Majesty's Government should at this stage appreciate the fact that a demand for compensation or assistance in some form is almost certain to be made.'^ 6. It seems to the Government of India to be impossible to suggest that the Indian revenues could undertake any sort of responsibility in this connection,! although the Government of India cannot at the stage of separation refrain from drawing the attention of His Majesty's Government to the effect of the change/the 11 interests of these salt works! It also seems impossi -hie to contemplate imposing upon the Indian Government and — Legislature of the future any obligation to maintain for a separated Aden the benefits that Aden at present enjoys from the operation of the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act., it + thp hands of ths fut/urs would in any case be improper to tie the h . . ~ tariff oolicy to this extent*, and Government in a matter of - ^ &gt; the special consideration, as the secretary there is, moreover, the specie . , „ that owners of salt works on the mainland of State is aware, that owners .-vine earnest endeavours, and will certainly of India have been making Leris- induce the Government and the g I „ Hen from the benefits of protection, lature of India to exclude Thn . it remains politically a part of India. • lude the possibility that the Indian future might accord special treatment / continue to make them, to lature of • even while observation does not prec.

In this connection the Chief Commissioner says;- 'I think Aden will he able to pay for its civil administration if income-tax of Aden business finns now paying this tax in India is allocated to it and if prosperity of its transit trade and salt industry can be preserved.' To take the last point first, it has already been observed that no undertaking can be given that India will assist the Aden salt industry to maintain the high level cf profits which it is at the moment enjoying. As for preserving the prosperity of Aden's transit trade, that will be a matter for the local administraticn Separation from India will not affect this at all because, since it is a free port, imports from ^den (except of salt; are already treated in our ports as foreign imports. g # The points just mentioned will affect the yield of Income-tax.

In view of imperial interests j involved Government of Bombay consider that transfer of Aden to His Majesty*s Government is inevitable and agree *itn tae Chief Commissioner, Aden that separa tion should be effected as soon as possible by an Order in Council in preference to waitiqa fpr establish- ment of Federation. Having regard however to the definite assurances given in the past, Bombay Govern ment consider it absolutely necessary that full opportunities for discussion of the auestion should be given in the Legislature, To mitigate opposition to the proposed step, Bombay Government consider it essential that every thing should he done to reassure the Indian merchants and traders interested in Aden that the change will not affect their interests adversely and this can he done to some extent at any rate if the object ions to the separation mentioned by the Chief Gommissioner are met by assurances that (1) Aden will not be excluded from benefit of the \ Indian Salt Tariff; (2) it will be given the Income Tax now paid by Aden business firms in India; ( 3 ) arrangements will be made for th^right of appeal to the Bombay High Court; „ (4) enclosure in LNDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Utter m 0 22 M. Dated 1 f T- m ■ 22 IP 1953(4) Indian administrative personnel will not De withdrawn at any rate for some time. The position with regard to (i) is that the Salt industry at Aden is controlled at present hy Indian merchants (specially from Bombay). Eie major quantity of salt produced in Aden by the four salt companies is exported to Indian ports, although the quantity of salt imported into Bombay is almost negligible, the chief markets for it being Calcutta and Rangoon. The Indiat, Tariff A ot does not apply to Aden and salt imported from Aden is subject to excise duty levied on other Indian made salt. The tariff duty, however, on foreign salt imported into India is the same as excise duty on Indian made salt. This equalisation of duties led to severe competition by foreign manufacturers and the Government of India had to impose an additional duty on foreign salt for the protection of India production and stabilization of prices. The report of the Salt Industry Gommittee of the Legislative Assembly shows that the principle of making. India independent of foreign salt has been accepted and if the tariff policy of the country is systematically framed in future to carry out this object, the Aden Industry in which Indian merchants are interested is bound to suffer by its exclusion. The Government of Bombay therefore strongly support the Chief Commissioner*s suggestion that Aden should not be excluded from benefit of the Indian Salt Tariff. They/ also strongly support the Chief Commission er f s suggestion that income tax on income earned oy Indian firms in Aden but at present paid in India should be credited to Aden so as to enable her to paytav wayw ay and remain a tree port Th* • Die maintenance of her position as a free port is of ec Ua i importance to European, Ara'o and Indian trade interests at Aden. As regards (3) the Bombay High Court has the following jurisdiction at present in Men:- Ca* to hear references in civil eases on points o, law or usage made by the Hesident under Section 8 Of the Aden P-i-ir-n .4 n ■ ea Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1$S4; (b) to confirm sentences of death passed by the Resident as Sessions Judge; (c) to review decisions of the Besident in criminal cases if any point of law is reserved for decide of the High Court or the Advocate General certifies that there is an error on a point of law* The power of a Local Government to hear petitions of mercy is now vested in the Governor General in Oounciisinee the transfer of Aden to the Government of India. If Aden is separated from India there should he no difxiculty in retaining the present Jurisdic tion of the Bombay High Court on the analogy of the Hanzihar Order in Council, 1884, under which Zanzibar is treated as a District in Bombay, the Judicial Assistant being the District Magistrate, the Consul General, the Sessions Judge, the High Court of Bombay, the High Court and the Secretary of State or with his assent the Governor General in Council the authorities to exercise the powers of a Local Government and of the Grovernor General in Council. It may be observed that there is already a proposal for providing a regular right of appeal fromt ' ' vA r f , t C^' '■ Jt- v : ..c - r a v * (VK) from Men to the Bombay High Court and if the Heguia- Uon drafted by the Judicial Assistant in this connec ts is passed before separation, the Order in Council transferring Aden will only have to provide express!, for the continuance of the right of appeal to the Bombay High Court. In this connection please see paragraph 3 of my letter No. 5450-3., dated the 30th January 1933. as regards (4) the Bombay Government agree to supply administrative personnel required for service at Aden at any rate during a transitional period as suggested by the Chief Commissioner. There will however, be difficulty in supplying- an I.C.s. Judicial Officer, in case I.G.S. recruitment for the Judi iii Department is discontinued and since the European element in the Judicial Department is now at a low figure it may not be possible to send an English Judicial Ofiicer vice Weston, when he leaves Aden. On separation of Aden, however, the service on transfer oi the personnel will lie foreign service under Fundamental Rule 9(7) and the provisions of Fundamental Rule 110 will apply. Also in some cases it may he necessary to improve the terms of service so as to attract suitable volunteers to this station which is not popular with Indians, or to retain the existing personnel.

No additional charge will fall on Imperial revenues until separation of Aden from Inaia takes effect. We have not yet ctecidea at what moment this separation will, in fact, take eifect. The alternatives are: (a) on the establishment of ohe Federation, which we have tola the Government of Inala 'would appear the logical moment ior it'; (b) off^upassing of the Federation .act, if we decide to take powur in die separate Aden by Oraer in Council. . ,-iomwt, ive separation iiight, In the secona alternative o-p of course, take effect prior to the actual establishment of the Federation and Inaian liability, on our assumption, would cease ,rom no such additional charge can in any circumstances accrue consequent on a decision to separate until the deration Act has been passed.Private Secretary, ' ^ C,, ZyrJ&gt; -r&lt;^) • ■-'Avtsn discussion in ’/fe onesdav 1 g Gatlnet . ^ ^ I attach an aavance copy of^a memomndum which the Air kinistry are circulating. is satisfactory from our point 01 view. I understand that neither the //ai Office nor Admiralty are circulating a memorandum, 'but that the Secretary of State for War and the First Lord will in geneial speak to the Air I\ainistry point of view. The Colonial Office have no objection to the transfer, regard the financial point as one for the Treasury and are prepared substantially to grant the Indian desiderata on the civil side (paragraphs 5 and 6 v ci«; of C.P.37(33)). I ought to explain, as regards fro of those desiderata, that Sir P. Cunliffe-Lister is unwilling to give an indefinite guarantee that Aden will remain a free port. It may be important from the point of view of the Indian Legislature not to lay stress on~TnTs 1 (for practical reasons it is most improbable that it will ever cease to be a irec port) and for this purpose it may oe nece^bary to draft a formula in consultation with the Colonial Ofuce. The/The Treasury are not circulating a memorandum ana will not commit themselves in advance of the Cabinet aiscussion. Their general attitude at present is that it is for the other departments concerned to make out the political and financial arguments (a) in f avour of transfer; (b) in favour of the acceptance byH.Iv-.Cr. of so heavy a liability as ono of £150,000. I think there is no aoubt that they are in tact fully alive to the difficulty of securing or maintaining for any length of time an Indian contnoution m tne « Vt = nt of complete transfer and that they are equally fully appreciate that the complications which might arise either now or at a later stage ao regards mil' control if Aden were left under India are real. They . ,,pmisavour to bargain and may will, however, no dou^n ^n - , qav of £50,000 a year suggest an Indian conuri . Q _ in nv the discussion m for ten years. Judging a^ai ^ -i-'+pnps on the difficulty of en committee, insistence on u securing/ the AU isecuring any money without uuite disproportionate political uifirealties in the Legislature in the event of transfer, shoula uispose of this, if for bargaining reasons the suggestion is put forward. k Gr~~' Zty2.33THiS PUTUBK RaSPONSIBILinEa S' i 1 0R mm. iMkORAiaUM by 1’tl^ SriOIU'j^Y fltf p OR AIR, 2he Secretary 0f Stat8 f or India in his Memorandum G .P. (33 ), asks his colleagues to say whether in their opinion the balance of advantage rests with the separation ot Aden from India. He warns them that if Aden is brought under the new Federation, there is a possibility - if not a probability - that the Government of India will at some future date insist on resuming military control. There can be no two opinions as to the strategical importance of Aden as a vital link in our Ampire communications. The findings of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1923, referred to by the Secretary of State for India in paragraph 12 of his Memorandum, make$ this abundantly clear. India's interests in Aden are essentially commercial and sentimental, and although I do not in any way belittle these interests, they are in no way commensurate •with those of Great Britain, to whom the security of hmpire communications is vital. The Secretary of State for India invites us to face the fact that the separation of Aden from India will entail the loss of Indian financial contribution towards tne political and military services in Aden. I agree that u nis may be inevitable, but even the loss of the entire contribution of £150,000 per annum, can bear no relationship to tne magnitude of the issues involved by the loss of Great Britain's responsibilities ior the deiencc oi A e ! ha ve, therefore, no difficulty or hesitation to the questions propounded in paragraph in giving my answers to Q. -P Qt*+P for India's Paper, which are 17 of the Secretary of State as follow“ iS ess9nti al on grounds of imperial strategy to retain the defence of Aden as a responsibility of the Imperial Government. X agree that if the loss of any contribution '«/ I-iia is an inevitable consequence of the separation of Aden, then there is no alter- native ‘but to accept it.17923/33.

MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA atten&amp;nTiTcoLlguerraf uptr'^s to ^ 1 now the proposals to be laid before Parliament, in the forthcoming Whke Paperlnthri V h&amp; Constitution An important question of policy is involved and fm no h t ncTt unimportant, question of finance. Before aslcino- ,-nv rrvilon 1 or ’. Dut uot closely the details of these two problems, it mafbe 'convenilnTt^t t Xdd X briefly indicate the present position m regard to Aden. “ The Present Position. 2. Aden consists of two quite distinct parts— (1) the Settlement of Aden, which is in law part of British India, consisting of a small stretch of territory containing the port and town of Aden, the Royal Air Force headquarters, and the Koval Garrison Artillery barracks; and (2) the Aden hinterland, commonly known as the Aden Protectorate, an area of some 9,000 square miles, which is not British Indian or British territory, and which is under the control of a number of small Sheikhs in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. Up to the early part of the war responsibility, both administrative and financial (hut subject in the latter case since 1900 to a contribution, in respect of military expenditure, from British revenues), alike for the Settlement and the Protectorate rested with the Government of India, as it had since Aden was conquered by troops of the East India Company from Bombay in 1839. During the war, for military reasons, it was found convenient, with the agreement of the Government of India, to transfer the military control temporarily to the Home Government, and responsibility for the political affairs of the Protectorate was similarly provisionally transferred. Considerable discussion took place between 1921 and 1926 as to the future of Aden, and in particular as to the possibility of transferring it as a whole from Indian to Imperial control. But for various reasons no satisfactory arrangement pioved possible until, in 1926, a compromise was reached under which the mi itai} an political control of Aden was transferred to the Home Government, su ijec ^ o a financial contribution by India, the civil administration ol T ^^®| ) t: A eniei1 with the Government of India.

Necessity for Reconsideration. 4 The arrangements described above have on the whole worked without friction, though it is fair'to add that no special emergency has arisen during their period calculated to impose a severe strain upon them. In the ordinal 3 / course no question w'ould at this stage have arisen of disturbing them. Rut in connection with the forthcoming Indian Constitution Bill it is now necessary immediately to consider what provision shall be made in the Bill, and consequently in the White Paper, for Aden and in particular whether it shall continue to be a part of British India, and, if so, on what conditions, or whether the balance of advantage rests with its immediate separation. \ 7 iews and Enquiries of the Government of India. 5 . In these circumstances, I thought it desirable to invite the views of the Government of India at the beginning of this year on the question generally and in particular on the desirability and feasibility of complete separation of Aden from India. The Government of India have not yet themselves reached any final conclusion. But in reply to my enquiry they have requested, in order to enable them to decide whether, and, if so, on what conditions, they are prepared to accept separation in principle, that they should be informed whether, in the event of .separation, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to— (i) relieve India of the contribution at present paid towards the military and political administration ; (ii) maintain the policy of making Aden a free port; (iii) assume liability for the difference between revenue and administrative •charges without imposing additional taxation or reducing the standard of administration. The Government of India state that the present difference, on the basis of figures for 1929-30 to 1931-32, averages about £2,000 a year, but that in the event of transfer this would probably be more than covered by additional income tax receipts from certain Aden firms which now pay all their income tax in India instead of Aden ; (iv) retain a proportion of Indian Service personnel in Aden service for some years after transfer takes place ; _ , ,. ; (v) agree to retention of the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court if this is found to be administratively and legally possible. A further point (vi) on which they were anxious in the past was that a guarantee should be given that in the event of transfer there should be no racial legislation or segregation similar to the measures applied to Indian settlers which have been the cause of complaint in the past in East and South Africa. 6 . These requests have been discussed in the Standing Aden Interdepartmental Committee, and I understand that the Secretary of State for the Colonies sees no difficulty (subject possibly to the drafting of a formula in respect of point (ii)) in agreeing to an affirmative answer on points (ii) to (vi). Point (i), and the general question of policy involved in transfer, are in a different category. Both are essentially matters for a Cabinet decision, and no advance is probable on either as the result of further interdepartmental discussion. My colleagues, to enable them to reach a decision, will presumably wish for an indication from me of the importance from the Imperial point of view of bringing about the separation of Aden from India ; on the Indian reaction to any proposal for separation ; and on the necessity for taking a decision at this stage. Necessity of an Immediate Decision. &lt;. I will deal with these points in inverse order. I would observe as a preliminaiy that it is at least necessary, as I have mentioned above, to indicate in the forthcoming ^ hi te Paper whether or not any material change is contemplated in the position 0 Aden ; and, as I show below, we are committed to full consultation in India with the parties and interests affected before any decision to separate Aden can be taken. As my colleagues are aware, I hope that the White Paper will be laid be fen e 1 arliament, and the Joint Select Committee set up, before Easter. The mattei is thus of the first urgency if any change is contemplated.3 8. So much for our own time-tahlp 7} + this stage? In my view we \ neec ^ We face the rt satisfactory.

A sentimental desire, based probably to some extent on apprehensions of a practical nature, to retain Aden as part of India, has consolidated itself in Indian political circles in the last 10 years. That sentiment must be reckoned with, for it has behind it powerful and vocal financial interests, centred largely in Bombay, which have sunk money in Aden. Partly because of the importance of that sentiment the Government of India have found it necessary formally to pledge themselves to prior consultation with the Indian Legislature (though the consent of the Indian Legislature is not under the present Constitution legally necessary to a transfer) and with the various interests concerned, before any decision is taken in the direction of separating Aden from India. There is, on the information available to me, no question that any proposal for the transfer of Aden will meet with considerable opposition from the Legislature and from the interests concerned. 11. In these circumstances, if we decide that transfer is desirable on Imperial grounds and if it is to go through without difficulty in India, it is most important that the Government of India should be placed in a position both to reassure individuals who are genuinely apprehensive that local Indian interests will not be sufficiently safeguarded in the event of a transfer, and to make it^ clear that with the separation of Aden no further financial liability will fall on Indian revenues^ Such legitimate apprehensions as may be felt by Indian interests ought in my view to be met j' guarantees on points (ii) to (vij above. As regards the continuance of an m lan -financial contribution, I am rnyself quite satisfied that in no circumstances could an Indian contribution to expenditure at Aden be contemplated (save per laps as par o a hypothetical arrangement for contributions from all paitso t e anpure to w 1C maintenance is of direct importance) in the event of separation iein S^PP 1 ^ ' , a contribution would, indeed, under the financial arrangemen s con P ’ t0 t j ie to be voted by the Indian Legislature. But for all that i ^ oa which will 1 Legislature to debate the payment yearly, and the ee ia £ ° (I G p e further fear, be left by any decision to separate Aden ^ beia* levied Som accentuated by the feeling that an but could not affect. In my Indian revenues, which the Legislature might ^ ^ ^^^ibution at this stage, judgment, even were it politically possible to a t|]e ba ] aQce 0 f advantage is it would not be possible to maintain it. If, ' . ’ mas t in my view face the . thought to rest with the transfer of Aden from India, «re m*,t y fact that the resultant burden (at the rniet from Imperial revenues. ntemkt rather under £150,000 a year) must be4 Desirability of transfer on Imperial Grounds. 12 I now turn to the importance of separation from the Imperial standpoint. There*are in the first place certain obvious arguments of a strategic nature, which I need not develop, for keeping under Imperial control a station the situation of which s of such critical importance. I won d only refer to he findings of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1923 (S./S. 36th Minutes, ^3rd Ju y 32,). « /jj That as Aden is an essential fuelling station on the Imperial lines of communication to the Far East, it is of greater general strategic importance to the Empire than to India. It has also a strategic importance with regard to the Suez Canal, Somaliland and Arabia, and is the site of an important wireless telegraph station. . . . • m , “(2) That so far as strategical considerations, as set out m ( 1 ) above, are- concerned, it would be advisable for the administrative responsibility for Aden, to rest with the Imperial Government. ’ 13,, It is important, secondly, that there should be no misunderstanding as to* the implications of the constitutional position. Section 33 of the present Government of India Act vests the military superintendence, direction and control of British India in the Governor-General in Council. That section was amended in 1929 to admit of the transference of the military control of Aden by Order in Council to an authority designated by the Home Government. But this procedure does not permanently dispose of the question of transfer; and if Aden is to remain under Indian control, and the Settlement of Aden is to remain part of British India in law, and to be under the authority of the new Indian Federation, military control at Aden will in the absence of specific provision to the contrary automatically vest in the Federal Government, represented, of course, by the Governor-General, since Defence is to be reserved to his control. It would conceivably be possible to make specific provision to avoid this, and while retaining Aden under the jurisdiction in other respects of the Indian Federation, to vest the military control of it in the Home Government. But even if we adopted such a course and thereby drew pointed attention to the anomaly we were creating or perpetuating, it is a question whether matters would remain at this point. The inclusion of Aden under the Indian Federation upon its inauguration will very definitely compromise any future decision; and, if I am right in the view expressed in paragraph 8 above, it may finally decide the future of Aden. If it does, then possibly not immediately, but certainly ultimately, we shall have to face pressure, which we may find it difficult to resist, for the retransfer of the military control of the Aden Settlement to the Indian P ederation. It will be most difficult under the new dispensation to defend, over any length of time, the exercise by 7 the Home Government, within a part of British India, especially if represented in the Federal Legislature, of an independent military 7 control. 14. There is a subordinate but important point in this connection. I do not propose to develop it in detail, for here as elsewhere in this question our decision will be taken on a consideration of general principles. But clearly 7 , if and when the military control of Aden were to be retransferred to the Indian Federation, the question of an Imperial contribution in respect of Imperial interests at Aden woul call for consideration. Summary of the Arguments on either Side. 15. I have indicated in broad outline the problem as I see it. I may 7 perhaps now summarise the position. Aden is of great strategic importance, primarily from the Imperial standpoint, and the Committee of Imperial Depence expressed the opinion so recently as 1923 that Imperial interests more than outweighed Indian inteiests m this respect. At the moment a compromise of an interim character is in I 01 ’ ce ^ . e . r&lt; jj as the result of which, despite the fact that the Settlement of Aden is part of India, military 7 and political responsibility rests with the Home Government, have reached a point in the preparation of the new Indian Constitution at whic i 1 essential to take a decision as to what the future of Aden shall be. So far as can judged, this is likely to be the last opportunity for making a change (if we desne make one) wdthout greatly increased political difficulty, for a change will at ai involve legislation, and legislation expressly excluding Aden from the Indian Fee eia i or giving pow 7 er to take action by 7 Order in Council can at the moment conyeme lie passed through in the new Constitution Bill. For the reasons I have given nimpossible, even if we temporarily resent Government, to feel confident that we shoe 1 n' ' V C ? ntro1 t0 His Majesty’s th 1S position, hhe alternatives before us are a deelsfon 11 edi 7 fi \ d 11 eas &gt;’ t0 brough under the new Federation (with the conseauenl n , that .

As had been anticipated, no difficulty arose over the Government oa Inuia 1 s subsidiary requests, but no material progress proved possible on the financial question, ana it was agreed that the general question of policy involved in the transfer and the connected financial question must go to the Cabinet with an explanatory statement of arguments on both sides. While the Treasury would not in so many words commit themselves, both the discussion and conversation with Lr. Grieve left the impression that they attach great weight to possible future difficulties over military control; are inclined definitely to favour transfer, ana would be c '*AJ^ S * VVUL prepareTTrT^raer tcTsecure it, to abandon!any financial contribution from India. The Service Departments, while in principle in favour of transfer, had not appreciated that it might oe diificult in the event of aden remaining part of India to justify permanently the retention of military control by H.lVhG. &gt; and were principally concerned until this point was brought out to safeguard the grants in aid at present made to them out of the Indian contribution to military and political expenditure and to secure that no deterioration in their present position in Aden should take place. 1/ 1212 5000 9.32I now attach a draft Memorandum for the Cabinet (advance copies of which, if it is approved, might perhaps go to the interested Departments)* ih^ memorandum, which proceeds on the assumption that separation is inevitable at some stage (para*5 of the Secretary of State’s telegram 57 of 7th January on P.Z. 191/33),/has been discussed with Mr. Carter and Mr. Dawson and embodies various alterations suggested by the latter* *(is hoped self-explanatory, and deals in some detail with possible difficulties about future military control. A decision to include Aden in the Indian federation would also necessitate an early decision on awkward points connected with its administration, representation, etc. But it, seems unnecessary to do more than refer to these at this stage as in paragraph f ga If we are to escape an Indian contribution, it will be preferable to give no ground for a suggestion that we are anxious to secure the transfer of Aden because of our own domestic difficulties in absorbing it. % lvLXtTo*+' j 7 A J ^ separation of Aden fr0m India ’ t0 wh ich I now invite the attention of my colleagues, has come up for consideration in connection with the proposals to be laid before Parliament in the forthcoming White Paper on the Indian Cuiisti oution. An important question of policy is involved and a minor, but not unimportant, question of finance. Before asking my colleagues to examine more closely the details of these two problems it may be convenient that I should very briefly indicate the present position in regard to Aden. The present position . 2. Aden consists of two quite distinct partsypthe Settlement of Aden, which is in law part of British India, consisting of a small stretch of territory containing the port and town of Aden, the P.A.P. headquarters, and the P.G.A.barracus, toohni«all^q4p c ^ u ^ Qf; * ' in ' l[, ^ e snathe Aden hinterland, commonlp known as th^don Protectorate, an area of some 9,000 square miles, which is not British Indian^territory anr wM ch is under the control of a number of =mall Sheikhs in treaty relations with jup to the early part of the Wax responsibility, both administrative and financial (but subject in the latter case since 1900 to a contribution, mrespect | of military expenditure, from British / revenues/revenues) /the Settl ement, and the Protectorate rested with the G . 0 f i., hcd since Aden was conquered by Ui ° 0pS °' tne East In dia Company from 111 1639 ‘ During the War, for riiilitary reasons, it was found convenient r-ith the agreement of the G.of I., to transfer the military control temporarily to the Home Govt, and responsibility for 'one political affairs of the Protectorate was similarly provisionally transferred-is LSnl C!Tns:--qiipri+. pv, Ti or „.. + ^. f t;i0 tla a. Considerable discussion took place between 1921 and 1926 as to the future of Aden, and in particular as to the possibility of transferring it as a whole from Indian to Imperial control. But for various reasons no satisfactory arrangement proved possible until, in 1926 , a compromise was reached under which the military and political control of Aden wa.s transferred to the Home Governnieru, subject to a financial contribution by India, the civil administration of the settlement remaining with the G-. of I. Cabinet Conclusion (CP 66(26)) remarked.- 'Ibis arrangement will secure Imperial / control in all essential matters, but leave India the satisfaction of retaining Aden as part of India and still controlling tne civil affairs of the Settlement including its resident Indian population.

Such legitimate apprehensions as may be felt by Indian interests omght in my view to be met by guarantees on points ii to vi above. As regards the continuance of an Indian financial contribution, I am myself quite satisfied that/that in nol^circumstances ^owa'an Indian contribution to expenditure' at Aden be contemplated (save perhaps cgta xontri-hnti sn joinll^rtLathan. parts of the Empire to which its maintenance is of direct importance) in tne event of separation being approved. Such a contribution would indeed under the financial arrangements contemplated-fee non-VTrtable. But for all that it would remain open to the Legislature to debate the payment yearly, and the feeling of grievance which will, I fear, be left by any decision to separate Aden from India would be still further accentuated by the feeling that an unjustifiable cifrubribution was being levied from Indian revenues which the Legislature might criticise but could not affect. In my judgment, even were it politically possible to require such a contribution at this stage, it would not be possible to maintain it* If, therefore, the balance of advantage is thought to rest with the transfer of Aden frcm India, we must in my view face the fact that the resultant burden (at the moment rather under £150,000 a year) must be met from Imperial revenues*^ npgi rabilitv ^ transfer on Imperi grounds , 12* I turn to the importance of || -ss? separation from the Imperial standpoint.

At the moment a compromise of an interim character is in force there,.as the result of which, despite the fact that the settlement of Aden is part of British India, military and political responsibility rests witn the Home Government.

(or the Indian Legislature) to agree to separation unless they are given quittance from the contribution, fobreover, while it would indeed be technically possible to override the G.of I., to take away Aden,and at the same time to impose such a contribution on Indian revenueslft would be politically most unwise and inexpedient to endeavour to do go at this stage, and it would probably in practice be impossible for any period to contribution, which, though maintain such a not votable, would be open for discussion by/by tile Pedera l Legislature. questio ns tor d fi r.-i a inn \ ,»» * 17 ' 1 as!c ^lleagues in these circumstances to decide*-^ (a) whether in their view the oalance of aavantage rests with the separation of Aden from India; end (o) wnether.aad if so, I may infonn Jlie - r *oi I. that in the event of their agreeing to separation, H.M.G. will he prepared to relieve them of the contribution at present paid by them towards military and political expenditure at Aden.Ta question of the future of ^ l7 c considered in ttie Standine *n 3 oi^uing A uen Goiariittee t- .. three Defence Departments, Treasury i • » i.ea 0 ury, India Office erH Colonial office behig present ■ no , p toent ’ ancl far.

It was agreed that no further advance coula he made hy interdepartmental discussion, and that if the Secretary of State for Inaia saw no objection he should circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet, setting out the facts, ana the possible political or constitutional difficulties involved in leaving Aden under the control of the Government of Ihuia; ana asking lor a decision as to whether the balance of advantage was regarded as lying with/vL t, I&gt;ii' • Wal X0R, Ai&gt;t , 1'ir.

The history these discussions is conveniently set out in hr. Wakely’.s memorandum of July 1923, B.379, attached. The general basis of the Indian contribution appears throughout to have been that Aden was of particular importance to India and that it was reasonable, therefore, that she should make some contribution to the expense of its defence and to the carrying out of local policy the reactions of which were of potential interest to her. As will be seen, the Welby Commission were of opinion that 'if the fhipire were organised as a whole Aden would be an Imperial charge towards which the members of the Empire would contribute, but in the absence oi such an organisation another arrangement must be made and the equity of die case would perhaps be met if the United Kingdom were to contribute/contribute one-half 0 f the milit. , the India OHice repr8s®tativ es Tt &amp; 1922 conference, taking the R. port of “ tertl9 »™fflt al -~,dre.att:r::it::r s * rrtirr : lts ° reatl y ^creased by the &amp;c.r*n+ „ new British responsibilities in the Middle East ^ ^ ‘:Tt Ily “ comMtl ° n 011) ’ 2,16 « nuatralia, he.

But I think the line may reasonably be taken that the desirability of transfer has beenraisea oy the Imperial Departments; that it is in Imperial interests; that so far as can be judged it is likely to have a rough passage in the Inaian Legislature; that if the u-ovemmcnt of India are to be persuaded to agree it is essential that they/Whi0h the y had previously ex Dr . „ J ex P re ssed in 1917 that if were comoletf .1 „ „„ 11 Aden ■ y - Lex eiy severed from t . , ‘ r0m Indla - India could not ohei eai ter equitably he called the o f ^ ° bear any 3har « of tne cost.

There are two possible principles on which a contribution can be justified:- (a) that India should contribute towards the defence of what is part of India; (b) that she should contribute on account of the interest which she has in common with the rest of the xhipire in the defence of an imperial station of great importance. If Aden ceases to be part of India (a), of course, ceases to apply, and, as regards (b) , the application of such a principle in the case of Aden would seem to go rather contrary to recent tendency, which is to recognise the imperial element in interests and liabilities which a.re primarily Indian rather than vice versa. The argument that India should still contribute, because H.M.G. contributed even when Aden wholly belonged to India,is double-edged) the G. of I. might reply &lt;W^^ince an Imperial liability was recognised even when Aden belonged exclusively to India, how much more should it be recognised new that Aden will belong exclusively to H.M.G. + rue* mricst unlihdy that tns It therefore seems to me mo , n+h t0 p-ive up Aden and to continue G. of I. will agree both .0 give pa contribution towards its cos t. i f( Treasury show signs of standing out for we shall probably i^ediately come to a jC 8'^' icil OW elf 'fcST TTlPP+ivicr 4- ^ uer £meeting to-morrow whet' o-morrow whether a deadlock If, therefore, the out for a. contribution come to a deadlock.

There would then be time to thrash out the financial question between the G. of I. and the Treasury (pending v/hich the G. of I. can hardly go to the Legislature) and for the subsequent consultation with the Indian Legislature on the proposal to transfer Aden. The transfer could then be brought about by separate legislation, or, alterna.tively, by Order in Council if it were decided to insert an enabling provision in the Government of India Bill.SECRET.

Shortly after the outbreak of war the Government of India assumed control also of political relations with the Yemen and Asir as well as with the Protectorate. But as a result of changes introduced in the course of the war, and intended at the time to be temporary and provisional only, the system of administration at the present time is complicated and anomalous. In 1917 it was decided to transfer the control of political relations (i.e.. primarily, relations with the Yemen and Asir, but the arrangement has been applied also to political relations with the Protectorate) to the Foreign Office, and military control (defence and operations) to the War Office, leaving the local administration in the hands of the Government of India. On the formation of the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Office in 1921, that Department took over the functions of the Foreign Office. The resulting position is highly unsatisfactory.

The General Officer Commanding and Political Resident is now responsible to four separate higher authorities, the Government of Bombay (and through that Government to the Government of India and the India Office), the Colonial Office, the Commander-in-Chief in India, and the War Office. It has been impossible, under such arrangements, to avoid some ( egiee of confusion and friction.

A 78 50 1.25As regards the first question, the suggestion that Aden should he severed entirely from India and transferred to the administration of the Imperial Government has een made more than once in the past, and apart from the developments of Indian UCCJ-i met _ i ^^44 iif havpr h Q c hanr» 4 -^ been mat tl ‘ i t vear or two, no objection, it is believed, lias been taken to P ubllC Z recent Vears .° The Government of India themselves offered in lOOfc (siibiect- 1 of course, to financial conditions which will be noticed later) to transfer^ Aden and again in 191 7 they expressed their concurrence with the proposal The connection of Aden with India is indeed little more than a result of the historical accident of its capture by a force from India. 1 he direct interests of India in A.den are not great. Only a numerically small piopoition of the piesent population is of Indian birth (though the Indian residents include many of the most prominent merchants and have taken a leading part in the growth of the Settlement and Port), and India’s share in the export and import trade, though important, is not Pi G POrf the o^her hand, the situation of Aden, its position in command of the most important trade route of the world, which unites Great Britain not only with India but also with East Africa, Mesopotamia, Ceylon, the bar East, and Australia, and its proximity to the Hedjaz, to Central Arabia and Somaliland, render the control of its ) policy and defence a matter of Imperial importance. Ihe decision to cieate a na^al ' base at Singapore would appear to accentuate the force of these considerations. It is understood to be the view of the General Stall that, having regard especially to possible constitutional and political developments in India, Imperial strategic interests would best be secured by the transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government. The requirements of a unified Middle Eastern policy presumably point in the same direction. The Masterton-Smith Committee, on whose report the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Oflice was set up, recommended that Aden should be taken over by the Colonial Office, and the recommendation was approved by the Cabinet, subject to the approval of the Government of India, which (primarily for financial reasons) has not yet been obtained. Against such, positive reasons, from the Imperial point of view, for transferring Aden has to be set the fact that a very strong feeling against transfer in principle has been manifested recently in Indian political circles. In September 1921 the Council of State passed a resolution in favour of the retention of Aden by India with only one dissentient. There is no reason to think that the Legislative Assembly would take a different view, and the Government of India have promised that the matter will not be decided without giving the Assembly an opportunity for discussion. The Government of India have reported since that Indian opinion has continued to harden against the relinquishment of Aden. The only chance of obtaining the assent of Hie Indian Legislature would appear to be for His Majesty’s Government to offer terms as to outweigh other considerations in a time of financial B ioj.&lt;-i.,ure wou so linanciaily attractive stringency. ^ 1 l Vg p . Phis introduces the question of finance, with which it will be necessary to deal at some length. A table is appended showing, according to the latest information available in the India Office, the total expenditure at Aden, and its division between Imperial and Indian revenues, for each year since 1910, and for some earlier years. It will be seen that before the war the total cost of Aden worked out approximately at 200,000L a year. Prior to IwOO India bore the whole charge, civil and military. In that year the question was examined by the Welby Commission, who recorded the opinion that “ if the Empire were organised as a whole, Aden would be an Imperial charge, towards which the members of the Empire would contribute, but in the absence of such an organisation another arrangement must be made, and the equity of the case would perhaps be met if the United Kingdom were to contribute one-half of the military charges.” (The civil charges, it will he noted, are compara tively insignificant in amount. The whole question is in effect one of military expenditure.) 1 u pursuance of this recommendation it was arranged that from 1900 onwards, though Aden continued to be administered by India, the obligation of the Imperial Government should be recognised by their making a contribution of a fixed annual sum of 72,OOOh towards Aden charges, in addition to bearing half the capital outlay on special defence works, fliis contribution has continued unchanged up to the present time (supplemented only, as explained below, by an additional contribution in lespect of additions to the strength of the garrison due to the war). (Note.— The contribution actually credited bv the Home Government in respect of Aden was.nominally l()0,(XXffi ; but of this amount 28,0002. was really in substitutionfor a portion of a contribution towards the cost of ,1 r r SIS' War O.Ik-o possible, in the -Aation was loft TrJi; 'i iJ L uail , u l ai ] 'espoiisibilit, v . standing that this was without preiudice to nT i ’ but sub J ect h) the under- and all, subsequently-India claLih thai in th 6 ot Ade “’ arrangements as regards incidence of cost shonia i ° sucil trailsfe r the new One effect of this arrangement as i^rn^l '**'9**™ rftect to 1!U7. revenues have continued to hear (thonoh oniv in bee “ that to the possibility of readjustment^ cl,aT4 'Ll T a!M ' sub j^‘ the Protectorate, although the Government of Jndh I, ° t ’ 0 '',' a 1 ' eiatl011s '’itli relations. 11 ot Juclla have ceased to control these During the war the cost of Aden o-reatlv innr^a^i • r r perations and to the growth of military charts ^nenHv^TV 1 t0 &lt;,Ct ' aI mi!ital ,' y fas that India should meet the cost of the d od 16 a ™&gt;.&gt;gement made oper was that India should meet the cost of the ore-war stmno-tl, ^ .0 rates—subject to the above contribution of P 72 UOOZ —whfle the emfT 18011 ^ ^ irren 1 t forces maintained there (described loosely and not a^W a^the'ds 0 Aden operations ) should be equally shared between India and His \ a eA’s Before descnlnng the course of the recent discussions as to the future incidence of expenditure, reference should perhaps be made to the proposals made by the Government of. India in 1P03 and 1917. In the former year they offered, if Aden were transferred, to contribute to Imperial revenues 77,000/. a year in respect of Aden; but in 1917 they expressed the view that, if Aden were to he completely severed fiom India, India could not thereafter ecputably be called on to bear any share of the cost. The question was taken up again on the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee (which did not itself make any proposal for the division of expenditure). The Government of India, after considering the Committee’s recommendations, telegraphed officially on the 1 ith April 1923 that they were prepared to agree to the transfer of Aden to the Imperial Government, and to make from Indian revenues a contribution of 100,000/. annually, subject to the clear understanding that this should be regarded as a final quittance, and that Idis Majesty’s Government would then he responsible for all charges connected with Aden, whether military or civil, including subsidies to chiefs in the Aden Protectorate. The question v r as further discussed in private correspondence between the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for India and the A iceroy. Mr. Churchill proposed that India should make to the Middle Last Department an annual contribution of a lump sum for a period of years to cover her share in the cost of Aden and also the services which the new department would perform in safeguarding Indian interests in Arabia generally, and originally suggested 500,000 . Mr. Montagu subsequently agreed to place a figure ot Rs. 50 lakhs befoie the itcio_\ and the Indian Council. ‘This figure corresponded roughly to the cost ot Aden to the Government of India in the then current year, and assumed bioadh t at, v 11 e ^ )IU&lt; reduction might be caused by economies in military expendituie, t ns saving won c be set off, solar as India was concerned, by her assessment to some portion ot the liability in respect of the contemplated subsidies, Ac. ie^ ^ fil iq*, Pnmicil correspondence expressed the view that he could not possi i y pi°p a higher contribution than 250,0001. a year.

I P The Secretary of State at the same time telegraphed this suggestion privately to the Vicerov, mentioning also that General Scott hoped to be able to reduce the total rnilitarv expenditure to 415,0001. The Viceroy m reply expressed his wiffinguess to endeavour to put through a proposal on these lines it His Majesty s Government would make one ; but Indian opinion had continued to harden, and was now set on retaining Aden. , . . . it-\i i • On' the 9 4th January 1923 Lord Peel wrote (privately) to the Duke of Devonshire suggesting that, taking 450,C00Z. a year as the military expenditures the annual Indian contribution to the total cost of Aden should be fixed at lo0,000Z a }yai, subiect to revision after five years. If an offer on these lines were forthcoming, Lord Peel would be prepared to abandon the claim to retrospective effect pnor to il st April 1920. , . , . On the 20th February the Duke of Devonshire replied that this solution was “ quite unacceptable ” to the Colonial Office. On the Sth March Lord Peel wrote pointing out some apparent misapprehensions on the part of the Colonial Office, am. asking for a more explicit statement of the Colonial Office position, lo this lettei no reply has been received _ ^ i u r Meanwhile the Government of India had on the 5th February telegraphed officially offering to advocate the transfer of Aden in the Indian Legislatuie on the basis of India being relieved of all but one-third of the net cost, subject- to a maximum of 150.000Z. in any one year, on the understanding— (1) that expenditure connected with the Imam and the Idrisi should be excluded, and (2) that the question of retrenchment, and especially military retrenchment,. should be investigated by a special Committee. II transfer were made on this basis, they were prepared to waive the claim to retrospective readjustment from 1917. In the alternative, they were prepared to resume full control of Aden and the Protectorate ; and they pointed out that in this case also financial readjustment was clearly necessary. They considered that equitably His Majesty’s Government should now be asked to contribute two-thirds of the net cost of Aden and the Protectorate ; but they 7 would nevertheless be willing to accept a contribution of one-ball. They stipulated that all political and militarv expenditure involved by relations with the Imam and the Idrisi (of which they were willing to assume control, under His Majesty’s Government) must continue to be borne entirely by His Majesty’s Government. finally, they suggested as a possible way out of existing difficulties a com promise under which the existing temporary arrangements would be regularised and developed. The Aden Settlement would remain part of India, and the civil and municipal administration would bo retained under the Government of India ; all the rest, military administration included, would be transferred to His Majesty s Government.

In the I , 11 cial sphere it would also be necessary to come to some arrangement for recouping to India the value of buildings, &amp;e., transferred. In regard to expenditure, reference may also be made to the possibility that (following on the suggestion of the Welby Commission) other parts of the Empire might be asked to contribute to the cost of Aden. Probably in practice such a request could be addressed only to such portions of the Empire as are specially interested, and one suggestion is that such portions should between them contribute one-third of the total, i.e., one-half of the non-Indian share. ^ But this question is one for His Majesty’s Government, and for the Colonial Office in particular, rather than for the India Office. Various other questions of detail would also have to be settled in connexion with a decision either that India should resume full control or that some compromise such as that suggested by the Government of India should be adopted. But these need not pierhaps be specified here. It may be mentioned, finally, that the Government of India telegraphed again officially on the llth June last (1923) asking for an early reply such as would enabie them to place concrete proposals before the Indian Legislature. L. D. W. July 1923. The above memorandum was drawn up for the Secretary of State (Viscount Peel) in July 1923. A meeting ol the Standing Sub-Oommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 23rd of that month (at which the Secretary of State attended) recorded its opinion that Aden is of greater strategic importance to t ie unpin, lan to India, and that, so far as strategical considerations are concerned it would be advisable for the administrative responsibility for Aden to icst wi e m P e d Government.

I have suggested a day somewhat later in the week than that proposed in your letter because this will give us time to refer to higher authority.

Please 0lje iJrevious submission on p.z IqiaJ ana tne telegram ^nt +„ + u *^* i9i/33 i, +h + t0 the Gov ernment of India on that paper. Th^ Phio-f n ^ Ghlef Goiar ‘issi 0 ner's views on the Que^ ion generally are given in the Government of j inaia's teiegram of 24th January. As will be seen ne has taken the lead given in our telegram in favour ox aefmite separation from mala, and, on the ! assumption that eventual separation is inevitable, favours separation at the earliest possible moment, me Government of India, with a view to reaching a decision as to the recommendations to be made to the Secretary of State, have asked for further information as to the attitude which would adopt in the event of separation on five specific points. It will he noted that these do not include Colonel Reilly's suggestion that Aden should be allowed to remain within the Indian Salt Tariff - a recommendation which, I understand, is, however important from the point of I view of Aden, unlikely to be palatable to India. 2. The position as regards the five points on which the Government of India ask for the views of H.M.G. appears to be as follows:- (a) The present Indian contr ibution to military snd political expenditure . This, it will be remembered, unuer the terms of the Cabinet decision of 1927 is one-third ox military and political expenditure at Aden (including the | Protectorate), subject to a maximum of £100,000 a year. I Clearly our line hi dealing with the Imperial Departments on this point (more especially s Departments are known on Imperial grounas i strongly/ Servicestrongly to favour the separation of Aden, ana the Treasury have raised it in conversation) would he that we assume thtTSthe transfer of Aden liatility from Indian revenues ceases and that there would he an end of the present contrihution. For hargaining reasons it is, however, to he anticipated that the Treasury may press us (particularly if Aden is left outside the Indian Salt Tariff and as a result its financial position is likely to worsen) for some Indian contrihution, on the ground that it is haraly reasonable that they should he expected to take over a liability the amount of which may increase with time If this point is strongly pressed ana a compromise is 1 necessary, it could no douPtIDe found oy an adjustment to an extent not exceeding (and probably substantially c~J- . _ | less than) ono thfrrd of- military and political expenditure at Aden, against whatever amount India nay stand to receive annually from the War Office consequent on the findings of the recent tribunal to enquire into military expenditure. (h) Aden to remain a free port . I have mentioned this point to the Colonial Office. Mr. Cowell prima facie sees no difficulty about it. Aden would, in fact, be in much the same position as Hong Kong. There are obvious arguments in favour of taking no step which, by interfering with the revenues drawn by Aden from its present maritime transit trade, would prejudicially affect its financial position. (c) Undertaking; to meet existing; liability for difference between revenues and administrative charges without imposing; additional taxation or reducing; standard o_f administration . The difference, as things stand, is exceedingly small, on this point Mr. Cowell, again without finally committing himself, aid not anticipate that there would be any difficulty with the Treasury, even if 5** i irt, i/.

I gather from informal discussion with Mr. Cowell that, if only as a matter of convenience, while they would look forward to filling all these posts themselves in aue course, they woula pro daily de glad to employ Indian Service officers for some little time. Those officers would, however, de seconded to the Colonial Service. Some difficulty might arise adout continuing their Indian rates of pay, dut that would de a matter for arrangement. Mr. Cowell was at first inclined to think that the Colonial Office woula prodadly wish to take over the appointments as soon as the term of the existing incundents expired, oat on further consideration modiiiea this view, which would, I think, clearly not meet the Government Ox India's point. ( e ) pjtf-ht. of appeal t o Bomioe-y High Court. There may be some legal difficulties about this so far as the Colonial Office are STcertain colonies there concerned it l is already a right/ i 1212 5(100 9.32right of appeal to a Supreme Court of Judges In other colonies in certain cases and in ^l^nejefor^ ^ - • • -- -S3S) (subject to the views of Legal Advise, there ought to he no difficulty about an arrangement such as the Government of India suggest. 3 . The best method of securing fcfreply from the Imperial Departments concerned seems to be to take the Government of India's points in the standing Aden Committee, ana the Colonial Office, if this course is approved, are willing to arrange for a meeting in the course of next week* The Treasury are represented on the Committee, as also are the Service Departments Mr. Cowell was of opinion that it was particularly desirable to associate the Service Departments with this discussion from the beginning, because their anxiety to secure the transfer of Aden was the strongest argument for persuading the Treasury to relinquish so substantial a contribution from Indian revenues as the £150,000 maximum at present paid to them annually* Subject to the views of the interested lepartments of this Office it is suggested that action night be taken on these lines and that there would possibly be no objection to bhe text of . the correspondence with the Government of India* An alternative draft is, however, attached in case it should be thought preferable to ^send an extract only. ^ he, i ' — i x. , y CLAAjOLA+j y 1,Secretary, E. &amp; 0..

Of these I prefer a* for reasons stated by the Secretary of State and because, eventual separation from India being apparently inevitable, it is better to effect it as speedily as possible,, Delay in doing so will provide opportunity and inducement for development of opposition and oi agitation foi reconsideration of policy. For this reason I would favour immedia te separation by Order in Council, if this is possible, in preference to waiting for establishment of Federation, Objections to separation will doubtless be raised both on sentimental and on practical grounds. In my opinion sentimental objections discounted as they carry weight in Aden only wi^h domiciled _ mil an community which is less than l/6th of the whole population, and, even with it, they are largely cloa* to cover genuine misgivings a. i io material effects of aep ara t ion , PraoWoal obJeotlonB are more important and ought to he met as far a3 pca8lbls&lt; ^ ^ I (1) Pr08peot of «c°lueion of Aden from benefits With regard to Of Indian salt tariff and fear of ooneequent ruin of local salt industry in which Indian firms are largely interested and the decline of which will seriously affect influential leaders of Indian community and also Government and municipal revenue from income tax and royalties c 12 ) Fear that dilficulty in balancing separate budget for Aden will result in imposition of import dutieBj, and that this will destroy its prosperity which is based on maritime transit trade and consequently on its being a free port* (3) Prospect of loss o^right of appeal in judicial oases to Bombay High Court* (4) Fear leet withdrawal of Indian Service administrative personnel will mean introduction of type of official lees sympathetic to Indian and other local native interests 0 (1) * India 1 b largely dependent on Aden for its salt and I would recommend that Aden be allowed to remain within Indian salt tariff and that 5 if p 0 88 ible P announcement be made to this affect*local Indians to new regime and promote general confidence in MiB/AW, (85 groups) 510. ?

If I read your despatch of 5th August aright para. 23 indicates that aim of your future policy will be to reduce duty and price therewith and I can assure you that I shall welcome any action tending to return to your traditional policy of cheap salt for north East India. I remain unconvinced of the reality of the danger or of desirability of retaining the duty to which the earlier part of that paragraph refers.

Stewart. A draft telegram, in which Mr. Dawson concurs, with the amendments noted, is submitted regarding Aden, a result of our conversation yesterday. I would suggest that the last six lines, from 'Further, I presume', of para. 5 might preferably be omitted, because this particular objection seems really to have little substance; if Aden were under the reserved dept, the G.G. would be completely responsible, and it does not seem that this arrangement could be criticised here on the ground that ministers would be consulted about certain aspects of the administration and by this means would be able to intrude themselves into responsibility for riaw son aerees that this passage Imperial interests. Mr. Dawson ugre / — adds little to the argument. I have consulted Sir E. Chamier about the , q-o 6. He thinks that it alternative (2) suggested m para. ,, feasible to deal with the matter in would be perfectly . . alrea ay in - -«rrrrr-jrj- L h : ofxn council (such Order has, of course,been ^e). It would similarly be feasible (and possibly with very little alteration of the Act) to provide an enabling power for the transfer of the civil govt, of Aden by Order in Council. Sir E. Chamier advises that if this course were adopted there should be added a proviso that Aden would cease to be part of British India with offset from ths dstts of such order. The suggestion that we might proceed by this means has perhaps a good deal to commend it. The G. of I. are so pledged to give full opportunity for consultation with the Legislature and all concerned in India before a decision to transfer Aden to the Home Govt, is taken, that the criticism in India / which must be expected in any case is likely to be much more vehement if we have to take a definite decision to transfer it before March next. On the other hand, if we simply propose to provide power to transfer it, there will be ample time to prepare the ground in India, and ample opportunity to consult the Legislature and the interests concerned; there will be aaple opportunity to bring the matter before the present Legislature, which presumably/presomably will continue in being until the federation is proclaimed, so that we should not necessarily have to face the possibly greater risks of consultation with the Federal Legislature, after that is ablished. The G. of I. may, of course, prefer emative (c) in para. 2 of the draft telegram. I H feel that this would be quite a practicable ir se. and have hitherto assumed that it was ^d to deal with the matter in this way, as had in suggested by the G. of I-. and a s s , + hv Clause 3 of the sketch, which itemplated by . exo i a des it from . of British India but exciua 3 n as part oi 5 federation. ld diecu8 8 L perhaps »r. “ d , draft telegram «ith yo» ? ^ ^ . t, 4 / 4' t-sTWil) Ua*L L- ~ tts V ■ /Department, From S. of S. to G. of I., F . &amp; P .

A.J&gt; 5 . a resolution was adopted by the Coancil State on 26th Septetnber, 1 S 21 , of ecomending that the administration of Aden should not be transferred to the Colonial Office. On loth January, 1922, Sir Denys Bray, in answer to a question in the Legislative Assembly, stated that the Govt, had no intention of arriving at a aeG ' L ^ iohout giving the Assembly an opportunity for discussion. In answer to a question in the Council of State on 9th June, 1924, Mr. Thompson stated that ’before a final decision is arrived at, the Indian Legislature will be given an opportunity to express its opinion’. The administration of Aden has been transferred from the Govt, of Bombay to the G. of I. with effect from 1st April, 1932. When this decision was under consideration care was taken, in accordance with the instructions in the S. of S.’s telegram of 15th July, 1931, to avoid any statement which might make it impossible, without exposing us to a charge oi breach of faith, to transfer Aden from Indian control, should this prove necessary at a later stage. It was made clear that the transfer from Bombay to India was made on its merits, and had no effect one way or the other on the question of transfer from the Indian to the Home Govt. A deputation waited on the Viceroy on 50th November, 1931, and were addressed by the For. Secy, and by the Viceroy. Please see para. 5 of the report of the Proceedings for hr. Howell’s statement. He pointed out iranqfer to H.1\G. were raised that, if the question of ^rano.er again/ 4000 3/32again, the G. of I. were bound by past assurances that full opportunities for discussion would be given, and the Viceroy (para. 6 ) added that all interests concerned would, be consulted. The position, therefore, is that nothing has been said to make transfer to the C.O. at this juncture impossible, but that repeated promises, going back to 1921, have been given that Indian public opinion would be consulted before such transfer is made. There is little doubt that before India is given full responsible govt. Aden ought to be separated from it4w~*'«W^&lt; But it is suggested that it is a question whether this | separation need take place at once, aspart ° ^Jhejfesent constitutional change sy Fight it not be practicable .o leave Aden as part of British India during the transitional period, provided that the administration oi Aden falls under the reserved Dept, of External Relations?! The G. of I. in their memo, on External Relations proposed this course, which they suggested could be justified on tqe ground that Aden is an outpost of the Empire. I. this I course were adopted, Aden could be transferred to tho Ho. .e Govt, at any time up to the date when the reserved depts. ^ are transferred to Indian ministerial control. It is true that if Aden, as part of British India, had to be represented in the Central Legislature, this fact would make it more difficult to transfer it it p. later date to the Home Govt. One relevant question, therefore, appears to be whether such representation would be necessary. Are other areas under Chief Commissioners j (e.g., Baluchistan, Ajmer, Coorg or the Andamans'' to be ; represented in the Central Legislature? It seems desirable that, before we decide the matter/ H m v A L. ^ 1 ^ L . L L ^Ulinute Pa,per. matter, we should consult the G. of I., as they are mvu... by proR'.ises to consult Indian public opinion before a decision is taken.
