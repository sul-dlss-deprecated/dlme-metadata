His plumed headdress and the nimbus that surrounds his profile mark him as a ruler. Holding a flower and resting against an orange bolster, he sits in leisure. While the trees behind him suggest a garden setting, the artist has painted the surroundings rather sparsely, focusing attention on the ruler. The dramatic, impressionistic sky suggests the paintingâ€™s origin in the Deccan (a region in south-central India), probably in or around the city of Hyderabad.", "CreditLine": "Gift of John and Berthe Ford, 2001", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/33849", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Illustration; Miniature; Painting; India", "Provenance": "John and Berthe Ford, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 2001, by gift.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.889_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.889_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.889_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.889_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.889_Fnt_UK.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689, 1503948", "ExhibIDs": "2071", "Images": "ARG_W.889_Fnt_UK.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
