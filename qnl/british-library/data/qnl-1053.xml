In his letter, Hamerton states that he does not think that the Imam of Muscat's nephew, Mahammed ben Salem, has been involved in the sale of indigo to Bahrain. Hamerton also states that it is plausible that some indigo was recovered from the sea after the plunder, having heard that small quantities of indigo were picked up by several boats in the area.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x00004a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
