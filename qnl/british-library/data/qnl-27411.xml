I understand that two directors of the K.O.C. are expected here early next month and may come by aeroplane. It is not, I think, your intention to hamper the activities by air of members of the K.O.C. (in a.I.G.C. aircraft)but having regard to the regulations I think you may desire to remind the A.I.O.C. of the need to inform this Political Agency 24 hours in advance of the desired landing of their aircraft. I can then adopt the form of asking the shaikh’s permission and telegraph the necessary sanction. S. I am informing the local Manager of the K.O.C. that permission should be obtained for aircraft to land but what would settle the matter satisfactorily is that the A. I.G.G. ^the owners of the aircraft) should be instructed to telegraph from their end to this Agency for the permission. 4 # I suppose that it is possible that euch persons as Directors of the K.O.C. may wish to make a reconnaissance by air, 0 \ - 2 - h of the Burgan and otiaar Oil sites in Kuwait territory, and I shall take it that you would have no objection to such flights provided permission is obtained when here and that the Neutral done is avoided?

His Excellency the Shaikh has also instructed me to inform you that the Head Guard at Bahra, will be given instruction to inspect all cargos and kit brought by your vehicles.

His Excellency the Shaikh suggests that you can appoint your interpreter, Abdus Salam, as he knows both Arabic and English, to the post of assisting the Head Guard for inspecting and sending the Passport to me for registration of Passport Authorities.

CUSTOMS INSPECTION ar Sir We would point out that from now on it is probable that mpany ! s vehicles of one sort or another will be visiting Basrah on average once a week and that the traffic will be mainly from hrah Camp, hence the present arrangements for the checking of ssports and Customs inspection at Kuwait Town will cause, we fear, nsiderable inconvenience both to the Company’s Staff and work. It is quite appreciated that H.E.The Shaikh does not wish , incur the expense of an outside Customs Post on the Safwan Road, id the amount of Company’s work that there will be, does not warrent te payment by them of a Special Customs Officer yet. At the same me under the present arrangement every Company vehicle going from hrah to Basrah and back again via Kuwait will travel an extra stance of about 80 miles purely in order to comply with the local issport and Customs Regulations, Not only does this represent a &gt;nsiderable waste of time but it is also expensive and we shall be )liged if you will approach His Excellency to assist us by making &gt;me more suitable arrangement whereby Company vehicles and staff .siting Basrah can proceed direct from and to Bahrah, It occurs to us that the Head Guard at Bahrah, being one : His Excellency’s personal guards, could possibily be entrusted Lth Customs examination of vehicles returning from Basrah direct to dirah, and could with the assistance of one of our staff make the jcessary records regarding passports, or failing this could collect issports for forwarding to Kuwait for record purposes. Later on, and in the event of our finding oil, we shall d doubt develop Kadhamah or some other port and then of course 3 shall be quite ready to maintain and pay for a Customs Post and Decial Customs Officer selected by His Excellency in accordance with rticle 7 (D) of the Oil Agreement.

This subject I reserved for discussion with you as you know but meanwhile it appears from our conversation with the shaikh ana the attached correspondence received from the K.O.C. that the Company wish to arrive at a compromise arrangemeHt over the establishment of a Customs and Passport Control Post whereby they do not build a post or pay a salary to a special official until they strike oil. They have suggested, and the ahaikh improperly agreed, that the Kead Guard (paid by the company) should carry out customs inspections. (The Head uard is, I believe, Murshid al Chammari, a ; inor Hedouin bhaikh and a crony of Col.Dickson*. They also wish to appoint another man p£ id by them, their interpreter, to act as Passport Officer. Inshort the Company appeal* to have the idea of establishing a sort of private but spare time Customs and Passport bureau. I propose subject to your views to rule out such a compromise and instruct ihat a special official (not spare time one) must be appointed by the ohaikh whose salary must be paid by the company to the shaikh who will pay him i.e. not through the Company. Je might waive the rignt the ohai kh has to make them build a special building until Oil is struck, (bee para 7-1) of Oil Agreement - file attached and marked).

Kerosene etc*, I see no way of getting over our agreement with the Landing Company, and although they must make 100^ on this type of cargo it seems we must put up with it* The towage problem is different, there seem to be one or two ways round it as follows (1) Retain Shemlan*s motor boat and tow the barge in with this# I see no reason why we should not do this, though I rather doubt if this boat is powerful enough to handle the barge except in very calm weather* (2) Obtain from the Landing Company a rate for towing the barge from the inner anchorage to Kadhamah and out again* (3) Hire banding Company launch onx a time rate and utilize it to do this work* The Landing Company will naturally want to try to stick us for full unloading charges at a per ton rate - this is manifestly unfair as they have no handling of the cargo to do nor have they any pumps power etc* with which they could handle the cargo* Having read this you will probably say, n but why should we worry our heads about it if the A#I*0*C* are willing to take the responsibility through their Agent of getting the barge alongside the Kadhamah jetty* tt The reason is that they will charge us whatever it costs them to do it and as we all know the Landing Company are very up against the A1 Ghanims (the A*T*0.C* Agents) the only hope of getting anything but piratical terms is for -us to get a rate for towage fixed, irrespective of whether the actual cash is paid by us through the A*I*0*C* and their Agents or by us direct to the Landing Company* A reasonable rate for towage would be as already( 3 &gt; Ion of the work, and the Cora- shall also have the right to ver the cost of same from moneys to the Contractor. se 9 . fhe Contractor accept® responsibility for all agents, esentatlves or employees, em- ed by him in the execution of agreement. se 1 C. the Contractor agrees to ish the Company on request with rmation and particulars of per- employed by him in the execu- of this agreement. jjHi CUI j jw-r ObM-rUdl i jl+il • «Jua ifrfccJ &lt; «jUJi * ^ ^ # JJk * ^ 1 se 11 .

According to a very strict interpretation of the terms of the Agreement dated the ISth January 1956, between the K.O.C. and the Kuwait Landirg &amp; Transport Co. such supplies of petrol wonid seem to come within the purview of the above agreement, as will be seen frcm the following:- Clause I of the Agreement says: 'The Contractor undertakes to carry out 'li^iterirg and landing work in accordance with 'the following clauses on all material consigned to the Company in steamships that may arrive at 'Kuw a it Harb our '. The first question that arises is whether or not the supplies in question are covered by ' All material consigned to the Co. in steamships that may arrive etc.' I should say, yes, unless the term 'steamship' is qualified - which it is not - to exclude steamships below a certain tonnage i.e. that of the A.P.O.C. barge which will bring'the supplies. The words M 'all material' are all-embracing and may mean anything on the face of the earth that may be consigned to the Co., the only qualification to it being 'consigned in steamships' and this, as I have said above, does not go far enough, as 'steamship' is a loose tern and can be taken to mean any sea-going vessel drawing its motive power from steam, irrespective of its capacity. The words 'lighterirg; and landing' occurring in Clause I of the agreement are so put that they do not restrict the application of the terras of the agreement only to materialwhich is capable bgjLh of being lightered and landed. Bulk supplies of petrol, in view of their peculiar nature are capable of being landed but not of being littered in the ordinary sense of the word. But in towing the barge full of such supplies to a point alongside the Kadhama jetty/the K.O.C. , the Landing Co. would bewould be performing an act in a sense equivalent to what in the case of other cargo would be lightering from a steamship, stowing and towing to the jetty* There is therefore just one point which the K.O.C, can, if they so desire, use as a lever in this matter with the Landing Go. They can always under the terms of the Agreement insist on the ’’unloading of all such material on to the foreshore, and haul it to above spring tide high water level”. If the Landing Go. are unable or do not consider it worth their while to make -to-m&amp;ke arrangements for unloading bulk petrol 'by pumps, through a pipe into the tank”, they would be so to say, failing to perform the ’’landing” part of the bargain and the K.O.G. can to an extent dictate their wishes. But should the Landing Go. be prepared to instal the necessary pumps and do the needful there is no getting out of the position and the L.G. are entitled to a full per-ton payment on all supplies under the Agreement. Again if the K.O.C. themselves for technical reasons do not wish to entrust the landing of bulk petrol to the Landing Co. the position will be the same. General Remarks. The above is the position as one reads it, but it may not be very difficult to turn and twist the words of the agreement and put on them interpretation which in ordinary circumstances they would not support. One does not profess to know much of Arab psychology, but it seems obvious that it would be a mistake to try such a thing in this case. It would only create an^wholesome impression about the dealings of the K.O.G. , on the members of the Landing Go. and their sympathisers in the Town, which in other words mear4 half the prominert merchants of Kuwait. Such an impression would be obviously undesirable in K.O.C’s own interest, particularly in the present initial stage of Co. T s operations. Besides in this particular case, unless very huge supplies are intended to beto be imported during the next 6/7 months of the year, nothing much would seem to be at stake. After all the present agreement only runs up to 21.12,56 - a matter of about 8 months more, after which the K.O.C. caMPalways modify it t o provide for a special rate Ire-tee for handling of bulk petrol etc. It would therefore seem advisable to come to terms with the Landing Co. even if it meant paying them the full per ton rate for the currency of this agreement. Manager is sounding Landing Company indirectly to see how they are likely to take this and will let me know r e su It. Id.G.S.de 6 • 6 • 56 • r\ •CONFIDENTIAL.

I enclose a copy of my memorandum No. 2752/18/78 dated the 31st December 1935, together with Prior’s letter No. 943 dated the 2nd August 1931 with enclosure, which will give you a fairly complete idea of what we arranged with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. This arrangement has worked well and I think should be applied to Kuwait. ~ 1 1 ^ 3. The most important point is the agreement with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, copy of which was en closed with Prior’s letter quoted above. No further •permanent agreement* has been entered into with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, which shows that the temporary one has worked well, and I suggest that the Kuwait Oil Company should in due course (see paragraph 5 below) sign a similar document. If they do so then the matter a s. .. * • Captain G-.S. de G-aury, M.C. Political Agent, KUWAIT2 - as far as they are concerned is settled. The Shaikh on his side, however, can, in the case of a claim hy a Kuwaiti subject or subject of a foreign Muslim Power, insist that it should go to the Joint Court under Sec tion 51 of the Kuwait Order in Council, 1935. If the Political Agent and the Shaikh cannot come to an agree ment there will be no decision and the matter will rest like that. Ho such case has arisen at Bahrain which shows that the Shaikh has been satisfied with the arbit ration of the Political Agent, and I see no reason why the Shaikh of Kuwait should not be equally content. 4. With regard to the scale of compensation for injuries drawn up by the Shaikh which we discussed with Scott. The Shaikh of Bahrain drew up no such scale, but was content with that laid down in the Workmen’s Compensation Act 'on the lines of which' the Political Agent would base his arbitral awards, and the Shaikh of Kuwait cannot force any scale on the Company, there being nothing about workmen’s compensation in his ag reement with them. If the scale of compensation in the Act is on the whole as, or even more, generous than the Shaikh’s scale, then presumably the latter will be willing to leave it to the arbitration of the Political Agent. His only other course in law is to insist on cases going to the Joint Court, see paragraph 3 above. 5. Please send for a copy of the Act (Messrs.N.M. Tripathi 6c Cd., Booksellers, Princess Street, Bombay 2, stock it), and then lay the whole question before the Shaikh consulting Dickson. When you know his reaction you had better report to me before approaching Scott. In the meantime you can inform the latter that you have-3- have heard from me on the suhjeot, and are getting the matter under way with the Shaikh before again approaching him, tH-Wi3 i a + No. 2752/18/78 dated the dist Lieoemher 1935 to the Jrolltioal Agent, Bahrain. Subject:- Labour employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company* • * » In 1S31, Kajor Prior suggested the application of the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act (VIII of 1923) to Bahrain, hut I deprecated the application of this complicated Act and eventually an undertaking was obtained from the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company, that pending a permanent agreement the Company would dispose of claims for accident compensation on the lines of the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1925, and that in the event of disagreement the Political Agent, Bahrain, would act as arbitrator. In this con nection see correspondence ending with Ma^or Prior's letter No. 943 dated the 2nd August 1931. 2. The position as regards compensation for injury by accident is, therefore, satisfactory. There remains hov/ever, the general guestion of the engagement, terms and conditions of service of Indian labour employed by the Company and to what extent these comply with the provisions of the Indian Emigration Act (VII of 1922). The Labour Roster of the Company dated the 1st October 1935 shows 33 skilled and 12 semi-skilled Indian employees all of whom, if recruited in India, appear to be affected by the provisions of the Act ( vide Section 2 and Chapters IV and VI thereof), and with the erection of the refinery, the number is likely to increase. 3. The Roster does not show any unskilled Indian labour, and it is unlikely that the Company will require to import unskilled Indian labour. It may be noted, however, that under Section 10 (l) of the Indian Emigration Act, the emigration of unskilled Indian labour to Bahrain would be unlawful until the G-overnment of India publish a notification rendering it lawful.4. It is not known how the Company recruit their Indian skilled employees* Do they do it through an agent in India? If* soj and if* he does not comply with the provisions of the Indian Emigration Act he would* of course, he liable to he proceeded against hy the Local Government in India, If the Company engage them locally, i.e. in Bahrain, the provisions of the Act would not apply. the case of Indian and British protected skilled labour recruited locally it is desirable that a proper form of contract should be entered into, setting forth clearly the rights and liabilities of both parties, including the point of compensation dealt with in tue correspondence with i^ajor Irior referred to in paragraph 1 above. This will minimise the possibility of suits being brought in the Agency Courts for breach of con tract, and if they are brought the Court has definite material on which to come to a decision. 6. 1 enclose, for your information, a copy of the forms of agreement used for Indian clerks and artisans recruited by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Is this, in your opinion, suitable for Bahrain? There is no need for an arbitration clause as any employee could file a suit for breach of contract in the Agency Courts. More over, the only suitable arbitrator would be either the Political Agent, or the Assistant Political Agent, and if either party refused to accept the arbitral award the case would then have to be tried before one of these officers in their judicial capacity, which would be un desirable. It is likely that any form of contract fixed for Bahrain will have to be submitted for the approval of the Government of India. 7. It is possible that, in order to afvoid conforming to requirements in the case of Indian labour, the Company-3- might instead reoruit only foreign labour, such as Persians, iragis, etcetera. This would contravene Article X\TII of the Mining Lease, and any tendency in that direction should he checked. It could he pointed out to the company that such foreign labour would he equally entitled as Indian, to sue the Company in the Agency Courts for breach of contract, and it is desirable for them also to have proper contracts. 8. It is assumed that the American and British employees of the Company are engaged on proper forms of contract. We need not, therefore, take up their case beyond noting that they have the right to sue the Company in the Agency Courts for breach of contract. 9. The interests of Bahraini labour employed by the Company are not our concern ^beyond acting as a channel of communication and giving our good offices to the State) and must be looked after by the Bahrain Governmei t 10. Proper contracts for the unskilled labour employed by the Company would not be practicable and are not necessary. As far as compensation for injuries is concerned they are covered by the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 above. The only class of unskilled labour regarding which difficulty might arise are Indians recruited in India, and as pointed out in paragraph 3 above, emigration of such labour to Bahrain is unlikely and is at present unlawful. 11. To sum up:- (a) Indian skilled labour recruited in -J-ndia: This class, if the provisions of the Indian Emigration Act are complied wi#h, will iuso facto obe in possession of a contract on which they can sue in the Agency Courts. , (b) Indian and British protected skilled^abour re cruited in Bahrain: This class should also be-4 provided with a suitable contract, vid e paragraph 4 above, on which they can sue in the Agency Courts. (c) American and British employees are presumed to have proper contracts. With regard to other foreign skilled labour, such as Iraqis and Persians: As this class also has the right to sue the Company in the Agency Courts, they should also be, and presumably are, in possession of contracts. (d) Bahrain subjects; it is for the Bahrain Government to safeguard the interests of this class and we are not concerned beyond affording our good offices. (e) Contracts are unnecessary in the case of unskilled labour. ; (f) The agreement with the Company regarding compensation for injury referred to in paragraph 1 above covers all classes of labour, skilled and unskilled. 12. Please let me have your views.-uv. ^ ^ G ? py of letter No. 943 dated the 2nd August 1931 from Captain C.G.Prior, Political Agent&gt; Bahrain, to the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf. Will you please refer to ‘.your D.O. No. 1375 dated the 2nd July 1931. 1 forward a copy of an agreement I have obtained from the local Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I think this covers us fully since we have no reason to doubt the bona fides of the Company, and as the Bahrain Government are agreeable to dispose of the matter on these lines, i suggest that subject to your approval we should accept this as sufficient. The Manager has informed his Principals that they can obtain copies of the Indian Workmen's Compen sation Act in London and when they have had time to consider them, they will no doubt agree to give us a similar undertaking to cover the rest of their time in Bahrain.I COPY) THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.

Your Excellency and Gentlemen - It is with great pleasure that I welcome you today at Bahrah, on this auspicious occasion of the commencement of the Kuwait Oil Company’s first boring operations. I had hoped that the Opening Ceremony would have taken place a week or two earlier, but the heavy calls on the manufacturers at the present time have delayed the delivery of the material. Even now as you can see the Rig is not complete but the essential parts for percussion drilling are there and so we can commence boring. In any case the day which we have all been looking forward to has arrived at last, and I shall presently ask Your Excellency to give the signal for drilling to commence. Before doing this however, I desire on behalf of the Board of the Directors of the Company, myself and the whole of the staff, European, Indian and Arab to express to Your Excellency our deep appreciation and thanks for all the assistance and encouragement which you have at all times given us, and for the continued interest which you have evinced in our work from day to day. Our thanks are due also to Your Excellency’s officials, great and small, v/ith whom it has been a pleasure to work. I have just received the following message of good will from the Directors for conveyance to Your Excellency:- ” Directors Kuwait Oil Company Limited, delighted that Shaikh of Kuwait has indicated that he will be present when the Company’s Well Bahrah is begun They hope that this undertaking will have successful results and they regard His Excellency’s presence as^a sign of the great cordiality which animate both parties to the Kuwait Concession Agreement They send Eis Excellency Their friend&amp;es/* Greetings ffIt is to 'be hoped that it will please God to prosper these boring operations and that they will result in an era of prosperity and happiness for Your Excellency, the loyal people of Kuwait and the Company.

You have expressed, Mr .Scott, your good wishes and thanks to His Excellency and his officials for what they have done for the facility and betterment of the Company and its staff. In return, I on behalf of His Excellency, his loyal officials and myself assure you that you will always find us willing to help with unceasing zeal. I thank you also for the assistance you have rendered me oersonally and other officials of the State individually and collectively on so many occasions and in so many v/ays. I should be failing in my duty if I omitted to convey you my thanks on behalf of the Kuwait Labourers for the kind and generous treatment they have always received from you and your subordinates. The spirit of genuine good will and cooperation which you have always displayed particularly in handling intricate matters has been always so gratifying, with the welcome result that we are witnessing the commencement of boring operations today. I hope and trust that this will continue to be the guiding principle of your Company in future to the mutual advantage of both parties. Lastly I, on behalf of His Excellency, request you, Mr .Scott, to tell the Directors of your Company, that His Excellency is deeply touched with the message of their good wishes and to convey them his high admiration of their appreciation of his help and cooperation and also to assure them that the interest( 2 ) and v/elfare of the Company will always be at his heart and that he is eagerly looking forward to the day when your activities will bear fruit. In conclusion, I request you, gentlemen, to join me in my devout and humble prayers to the G-od Almighty that may He crown the activities of the Company with a speedy and glorious success. Amin.m !

The following are arrangements which would seem to cover the compensation liabilities of the Kuwait Oil Company and the interests of its employees. 1.Europeans and iuaerloans.

By Emigration Rules, cannot leave India without contract; on which they can sue in Agency Court. 5.Indian. Iraqi and Persian skilled labour recruited nearby are provided by the Company with a contract in which compensation is guaranteed to be 'as agreed to by the Resident' which in this case is 'on the lines of the Indian 'WorJoaon’s Compensation Act'. In the event of dispute the Political Agent, Kuwait will act as arbitrator. The Company will be asked to acknowledge this latter in writing which they have not yet done. 4.

Telegrams ; U oco, Kuwait. KUWAIT 1st July, 1936 Dear de G-aury In reply to your enquiry of to-day's date I am sending you the following general information regarding the probable trend of the geophysical survey work to be carried out by this Company during the autumn, winter and spring of 1936/1937, It is necessary to stress the fact that the extent of the area covered will depend largely on the ease or difficulty with which preliminary data is found to be obtainable. The geophysical party as at present visualised will consist of fifteen American members under a Prty Manager who will be assisted by a British 'Camp Boss' in the person of Mr.F.T.Shields. I anticipate that the work of the narty will commence in and around Bahrah on about the 15th September. The members will be accommodated in one camp composed of three or four messes and the normal administration and dealings with locals will be effected through Mr.Shields. A suitable Kuwaiti interpreter or if necessary, interpreters, will be allocated to the camp, British Indian servants are visualised for the cooking and personal requirements of the party and a number of Kuwaitis approximating fifty in all, will be required for various duties such as truck and car drivers, rod coolies for surveyors, helpers for the coring outfit and other minor jobs. The work of the party will embrace seismic. gravimeter and magnetic methods in the first instance, thereafter the method which gives the most satisfactory results will be continued with. Quantities of explosive (high velocity gelatin dynamite 80/) estimated to amount in all to 40 tons will be required, suitable arrangement for the safe underground storage of this will be mad.e and special guards will be obtained from H.E.The Shaikh in due course to guard2 I this dangerous material. already mentioned the ?7ork of* the party will probably keep them in and around the v5.cinity of Bahrah ±or aoout tv/o montns thereafter their programme is uncertain and the area covered will be dependent on the ease with which results are obtained. We anticipate that the camp will tfKW© on completion o: the work at Bahrah to a suitable site approximately midway between Madaniyat and Burgan and. if the work in this district is completed within the time allotted the party's activities may extend to any other part of the Kuwait territory. The work of the party will be completed for this season on the 15th May 1937 at the latest. It is anticipated that throughout the period the party will work as a one unit and will not split up iniST isolated sections. Yours sincerely To Cant.

His Majesty’s Government understand that the Company is of opinion that the employment of these foreign experts is required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking, and they have accordingly given careful consideration to the matter, in the light of Article 3 of the Agreement of 5th March 1934. They recognise the highly technical and specialised nature of the work and the impossibility of obtaining at the moment the requisite number of English experts. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give their consent to the despatch of the survey party, whose operations will, they understand, last about six months. As your Company asked for an early reply, it was found necessary to incur certain telegraph charges (to and from Bushire and Koweit) amounting to £9.18.6. I am to enquire whether your Comx^any would be willing to refund this sum.

We have now received advice from Gulf Exploration Company that one of the party - Mr.T.B. Pepper - has recently suffered from poor health and it is thought inadvisable that he should go to Kuwait. It is proposed, therefore, to send in his place Mr.Henry Clay Reichert whose personal record is attached hereto. The Board would he greatly obliged if His Majesty’s Government would give their consent to this change. In view of the fact that the geophysical party intend to leave New York on 8 th August, an early reply would be appreciated. Whilst we regret the necessity for this last minute change, you will doubtless appreciate that it is thought best to send to Kuwait only those men in the best of physical condition.

This morning (4.10.36) I received a private communication from Abdulla al Mulla, copy of which I enclose for your information, which speaks for itself. It is dated 30th September 1936 as you will observe, and was only delayed in delivery, according to Abdulla al Mulla, because of the Friday holiday and my visit to Bahrah with Col.Loch and yourself yesterday. The point of Abdulla al Mulla»s letter, as he personally came and explained to me, is that H.E.The Shaikh interprets para 7 (B) of the Oil Agreement to mean that should any individual of the Company, as well as the Company in its official capacity, desire to Import firearms or other weapons, application should be made to him by the Company in the first instance, and that he, the Shaikh, would pass on such application to you with his recommendations. Prima facie the Shaikh’s contention would appear to be not unreasonable, and I see no particular harm in interpreting the para in question as he has done, especially as in such and similar matters the object of the Company will always be to work in amicable co-opera tion with him and his Government. The above of course, are my personal views only and it would be interesting to know how you interpret the para in qxiestion. As I pointed out to Abdulla al Mulla, I addressed you in the first instance, simply because I myself interpreted para 7.B to mean that only if the Company desired to import arms for guards etc., were they expected to obtain the Shaikh’s previous sanction.( 2 ) I thought that where individual British or American personnel were concerned, and especially if the weapon was for sports purposes, it would be sufficient to apply direct to you. For your convenient reference para 7.B of the Agreement reads as follows:- 'The importation by the Company of fire arms and other weapons is prohibited, except with the written permission of the Shaikh.' There is no other reference to fire arms in the Agreement. Yours sincerely. JgTU/ 3 Capt.

Suoject: Abs olute Magnetic Determinations EL-ag^rr Dear Sir, ±n time past our laboratory in Pittsburgh has received considerable data taken by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C. In fact, the regional corrections we apply to the magnetic data taken here are derived from data obtained from this source. Naturally we like to reciprocate, in any way possible, with informationthat may be helpful to the Carnegie Institution. For your information, the Carnegie Institution is an organization which does a non-profit type of research and is subsidized by various philanthropies. The magnetic data referred to herein is of a type that is useful in various lines of work and particularly in navigation. The results of the Carnegie Institution are open to anyone. In 1909 and 1910, the Carnegie Institution took absolute measurements of the intensity of the magnetic field of the earth in this part of the world. At the same time they observed the orientation of the magnetic north with respect to the true north. From year to year, these elements change in a way which has not been fully worked out. Various factors enter into the cause for this change, and until observations have been made for a number of years all over the world to observe the mode in which these changes take place, it is unlikely that the true cause and the nature of the changes will be found out. In these observations we propose to assist. W m The Carnegie Institution is sending us a set of their equipment for observing the elements under question and a list of the stations they observed when they made their trip In 1$09 and 1910. We propose to reobserve these stations in so far as it is practicable. Some of them are obviously out of the question. The data obtained would be published for the good of anyone who v/ishes to use it. The undertaking would be distinctly in the nature of a good will enterprise, but the information would be useful to any Company who might be doing geological work in this vicinity or to the navigators who use a magnetic compass in addition to the purely scientific advance in knowledge.V - 2 - :1 S following is a list of the stations which were observed in 1909 and 1910: Baghdad, Shuster, Basra, Mohammera, Kuwait, Bushire, Reshire, Madain Saleh, Tebook, Linga, Bahrein, Aden. In addition to the locations listed there is a station at Beirut which could be observed on our way out of the country, and I believe there is one at Rutbah. Of the stations listed, obviously Madain Saleh, Linga,Tebook and Ad©n are too faraway to be observed. Of the'remaining sta-cions some are in Persia, some in Iraq, some in Syria and one in Bahrein. It will probably take some time to get permission, if at all, to observe the stations outside of Kuwait. You will probably want to take this question up soon with Capt.DeOaury, the Political Agent at Kuwait, so that the actual observations of any stations may be made in our* spare time without loss of actual working time to the party. This can undoubtedly be worked in during slack periods. The first thing we should know is the difficulty of getting to any of the stations and what permission will have to be obtained.

The individuals concerned are PENYER HYLAND M CCAR TY born of American parents on 30th October 1910 at Sikes, Louisiana and DALIEL V a N SgiA i RINGEN C RESAP born on 22nd February 1912 of American parents at Segura, Louisiana, Both men are single and are employees of Gulf Exploration Company, one of the two shareholders in this Company. The reason for the present request is that, as you are aware, the Company is particularly anxious that the geophysical survey of Kuwait should be completed during the present cold weather. Information recently received from Kuwait shows that progress has been impeded by an insufficiency of surveyors. It is expected, however, that the addition of two surveyors to the party will enable the full programme to be accomplished. The Anglo -Iranian Oil Company has no surveyors whom it can spare for service in Kuwait.
