Sir, ith reference to affairs at 3ur# I hare the honour to draw your attention to an aspect of the situation .hich is liable to be overlooked when dealing with immediate affairs at Sur. These Amirs of the Bani Hu All#in spite of their title#are merely hheiixhs of a tribe. They are not strong enough or influential enough amongst other tribes#to form an independ* «ent Gtate without considerable extraneous support^and#! think are sufficiently Intelligent to realize tills fact. Their holst- -ing of Xbn Gaud's Hag#a fast likely to be resented by many tribes#shows that they are new counting on such support.Ibn Baud is too far a&gt;«ay to afford any immediate or material assist -ance except perhaps in the supply of arms from Jeddah.Such a supply is actually coming into Sur though 1 have been unable do far to ascertain its extent or whether it is being sent in by Ibn Gaud himself. The Amirs must realize that they cannot count on any direct assistance from that quarter and it seems to me the sup* •port «hich they are confidently looking forward to must come from other parts of uman itself.X think that Isa bln Saleh alsc^ realizes this and tfcuit nls fear of an immediate attack by Ibn Sand* \ V ±9 not as real as it oeems* The rest of Qaan outside Jaalan has latterly heen particularly quiet hut the situation Is not with- «out sicns of a cooing storm. The wea* links in Isa tin Saleh*s chain are the Ghaflrl trites of which the Ban! lUyam of Jat&amp;l Akhdar is the most im portant. The numerous retelllons organized ty Saleh tin All,the Father of isa t all failed because of the opposition of the Gha- -firi tribes, Isa's rebellion was successful because ho was clever enouch tojj&amp;yviy the wisdom of brInline in the Ghafiris first and Jelnin* the movement himself later. Ills relations with those Ghaflrl tribes must however be very prooarlous. A letter to mo from the Amir dated 19th October 1928 but which 1 have ***** seen after return to Jfusc&amp;t,makes the sltua- -tion more clear. He states 'if the Hlnawi tribes make any meve- -rnent* the Ghafiri tribes are ready to render help aocordlnc to the Intimation which has been received from the inhabitants of Gharblah Tizt Ban! Klyam 9 Daru and others,' It is clear from this letter that ho expects that in the event of his being attacked by Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Hlnawi trlbesf the Banl Riyam and other Ghafiri tribes will attack Isa bin Saleh from the roar, ^ The directing brain behind this movement has not as yet made its appearance but I would draw your attention to Gheikh Isa bin Saleh*s postscript to hi* letter to the Council of Mlnls- -ters dated 9th October 1928 forwarded with ay ho. 120 dated Itth October in which he sayo ' As you know Saiyid Ahmad went to fcejd with a view ho ine- -tigate King Xbc Baud, wo are afraid that hie going there might load to some disturbances', A souplo of ovenlngo age 9 the Rev, Van ibursem was talking ts mo after tennio and told me that eeme months ags in esnver- -satisn with Saiyld Ahmad of Jiazn 9 tho latter teld him that he was dissatisfied with Isa bin Saleh and proposed writing te Ibn * Gaud to come and intervene in muscat affairs.This ti&amp;lyid Vln Xtmhia: liln Khais helsncs ts ans«» -ther branch sf the Multan* • fanily Tieln« a nephew ef Azzan hin Kha.lu a ferixer Sultan, last JTuly f he obtained a yassyort fp#* the Ceuncil ef Ministers fer the estenslhle yuryese sf yreeeedlnc te Bahrain medical treatment and at the request #r the latter,he eh*» -talned a ne ehjectien certlfloats from this Agency for talcing with hi a escort of 13 mentis rifles 14 daggers 9 swords and 339 rounds ef ammunition. It a#j&gt;e&amp;ro that Instead ef obtaining me- -dical treatment at Bahrainthe haa gene te *ejd te visit Ibn 3aud. It would seem that he is either the head ar the oatsjaw ef the jireeent merenent. Te what extent Ihn Saud is involved in these intrigueot it would be difficult te Bay at the .present stage bat it seems te aae that he eon hardly be entirely blameless as otherwise those constant visits to him would soon cease. I ** oyinisn that unless very prompt and offootlvs action is taJrcn for the re-establishment of control at 3ur» and for the removal of Ibn Baud's flag(erected probably as a bait to xsa bin Saleh) a general conflagration throughout Oman may be expected. 1 attach a copy of All bin Abdu&amp;lah's letter to ms men- U / *-ds' -tioned above and short extracts regarding Saiyld Ahmadhis father. 1 have the honour to bo» Sir, Your meet ebodient servant.

The Council proposed spending that day attempting ts bring influence to boar on the gang through their Sheikhs and Mullahs. In the STening,ths Council informed me that these efforts had been useless. Said bln Abdulla refused ts era* -cuate the fort and sent word to the Council that ho would like to see them turn him out. The ’ouncil therefore decided to bombard the fort on the following morning. in order to obviate any accident, the Cosonander ef H.^•o.'Crocus' very kindly sent over an officer to examine their 3 founder gun to o.e that it wa. in working order, and7 also cure then the range ,^ut the actual firing ««aa left entirely in the handa of the Muscat Infantry* At 10 a«a* on the 24th October the 'A1 Said' oeaneneed firing on the fort* The aarksnanship was Tory accurate* The second shot hitting the aaall g square blockhouse in the £ centre at a range of 2000 t but of course as these vers not high exploeire shells and were Tory snail 9 the material damage *as not great* T*e rifle shots were fired fren the blockhouse in return but the range *as too great for then to teaoh any kvhore near the ”Al Said'* After firing nine rounds#the Council ceased their operations and sent werd to se stating that their firo was ineffective and asking that tt*is*3* 'Crocus' nay be asked ts bombard the blockhouse* 1 pointed out that before doing so I would have ts obtain sanction from Government and suggest -ed that they should persevere in their efforts* At 1*45 p.m. t the 'AX 3aid' recommenced firing and expended another 14 rounds* It became clear that little Material damage could be done by such shell fire* About 7 p*n* 1 was Informed by the Council that 4 ska she11$ had hit the blockhouse and that sne man#a friend ef Said bin Abdulla#who was with him#had been killed* They alse informed ne that the Arana and Ban! iJu All Sheikhs had asked then te suspend operations and were trying to Induce Said bin Abdulla to surrender* They accepted the effer of the Arana and kuwaris Sheikhs but replied te the Banl £u All that the case had been referred te the Arana and ?uwarls for settlement in consultation with Saiyid Shahab and there was ns need for then to interfere in the natter* Ay the nornlng of the 25th#the blockhouse had been evacuated and the flag renoved* 1 had received your tele- -gran during the night of the 24th -25th- and it seemed to ne that as this gang were now dispersed in their hones in Sur ns further operations were passible*It would have fceen Tory difficult to land at Su/ pn the 25th ewinc to heary seae.

I re- -plied that X was net authorized to do so as the Political *gKJt± Resident had said he would settle all affairs himself on the return of His Highness the Sultan.

X replied that H*M.S* 'Crocus' expected to remain at Muscat for some time* He also asked for letter of recommendation to which 1 replied that I could only give such on the recommendation of the Council* I confined my remarks to repeating the purport of your letter advising them that we were under treaty obli- -gations to the Muscat State and that we could not allow any one else to take Sur* The Amir replied that he would answer these questions in writing. After tills visit the Amir proceeded to the 'A1 Said' where he had a long interview wlth^ the Counoil. I have not l as yet learnt the purport of their conversation,the Councilof Ministers merely saying it was non comittal jut the Amir appears to hare repeated our conversation to thois as the Council remarked that the Amir*a object in asking for a passage to Bahrain was for the purpose of visiting Ibn Saud and not for medical trer-tiaent. The British community tried to call upon me on the 2£&gt;th but the sea was too roui^h and they were unable to get along side* X left 3ur on •Crocus* at 6 p.m. on the 25th instant. It x is difficult to say how much effect these operations have had. They were never intended to settle the tfur question as it was realized matters had gone too far to allow the conflagration to be extinguished by such a minor show of force. They were merely intended to show the people of (Xnan and the inhabitants at Cur that the Council did not propose to assume a passive attitude and that they still coiiimanded to some extent at least the support of the British Government. They hoped thereby to induce many tribes to hesitate before throwing in their lot with the movement. This f if successfulwill give a momentary respite. The Council,to whoa this scheme is entirely due, have on this occasion shown consider* •able initiative and deserve the credit for it. They have shown the people of Bur that the •Al Baid* is not an unarmed vessel and I think should a future X occasion arise,it will not be fired on with such impunity. I am very much indebted to Commander JS.O.Bell Salter,H.h.,Commanding H.a.a.'Crocus* for his ready cooperation and assistance and forethought in taking every precaution to ensure there were no untoward accidents with the gun on the *A1 Said'. 1 have te thank him and his officers and men for their kindnef to me during my stay on board and for the admirable manner in which they carried out all their relatio) with the Arabs.CONFlDiiaiTiAL, (83 J^o.

This country is occupied by mmeroue tribes.both settled ana nomad.For the sake of protection against their neighbours, with whom they are hawing blood feuds constantly,the weaker tribes become allied to stronger tribes. This method of alliance has resulted in the formation of two political 'I faotionst Hinawi and (ihafiri, so called after t.-o tribes, . I. hani M *** Hina and and Bani Ghafir,who at one time poss- -essed rery powerful Sheikhs to whom the other tribes became allied. The racial tie being a strong one,the Hinawi fastisn is composed largely,though not essentially of Yemeni tribes whilst in the same way,the majority of Ghafiri .tribes are of Adnani origin. * host of the tribes O^-Oman belong to the Ibadhi sect, an offshoot of the Khawarij.and the Imamate of Oman owes tXi its origin to the peculiar religious tenets of the aha.vanj as adopted by the Ibadhiyah. They disallowed the claims of the Baghdad Khalifahs as well in eiril as religious matters and set up one of their own whom they invested with corres ponding powers in both capacities. At first,for a period of nine hundred years,Imams were elected for their perso- -nal merits or capacity. From A.D. 1634 onwards,this prin ciple gradually underwent modification.The post was still elective but with a strong preference to the ruling family oyer strangers* The present dynasty was founded in 1744 by Ahmed bin Said who was elected Ima* on account of his patriotism and bravery in expelling the Persians.During his adminis- -tration.his sons obtained the title of Seyyid which their •descendants have claimed ever since.'The House of aeyyids' like the reigning houses of Burope.has become a recognised dynastyibut the gradual increase in the number of rival and aspiring Seyyids has been one fertile source of in- -testinal feuds which have arrested the prosperity of the country*The title of Sultan is an extraneous one and dates s ?rom the time of Seyyid Sultan bin AhmedU792-1804).It is seldom used by the people of the country, fhe authority ■ of the Tmtim or Sultan over his tribes has always been somewhat shadowy,owing perhaps to the inacoessable nature of the mountains, ravines and valleys of which the country consists. Intestinal feuds and wahabi invasions combined with the weax and vacillating policy of recent Sultans,ths degeneracy and incapacity of their family and intermixture with negro blood,have gradually estranged the Sheixhs of the various trifces* 'TebsiLlxjdr** Rebellion foliowed^until at last,after the rebellion of 1913 -m 9 ,when the Ghafiri and Hinawi elements com- -bined for the first time in opposition to the arras warehouse which we had induced the Sultan to establish, a fresh State was formed by Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harithi, supporting a puppet Imam of the Khalili family, who are identified with the kuta.vwa or extremist move- -ment in the Ibadhi sect. H.H.the Sultan has been left with Muscat.Matrah and its vicinity which were defenaed by British troopsjwith the Batinah coast which is always vulnerable to British shipsjwith Gv.adur on tne aeKran coastjwith Bhofar.a province which we assisted him m recapturing in lS»6jwith our which nas always been a troublesome placejand with a shadowy sovereignty over Jaalan,Dhahirah and auaandum.and the coast of eastern Hajar. The revenues of the State consist of a s u sidy from Government and a 5^ import and export oax at such customs posts where it can be levied.Other revenues are negligible.The total revenues are about 6i JaIcHs. It will be seen from the above that the ruscat Governmon exists entirely on the support which it is able to oc -tain from the British Government*This is tne natural result of our policy in 1*13,of defending Muscat and Matrah and affording naval assistance on the coast butbut maintaining an attitude of non-intervention in the hinterland* The success of aneiJch Isa hin Saleh in forming an independent State in Oman proper inclusive of the valuable Semail valley, has led others to loo* forward to doing likewise. Many Arabs came to the conclusion that w. were not anxious to see a strong Government established in ^ Oman and that we would countenance the formation of other independant authorities* This appears to he the opinion ol the aneiichB of the Bani Bu Ali.a Ghafiri tribe of wahabis in Jaalan.The** | Sheikhs have in recent years styled themselves Amirs of Janlan and in 1924,wrote to the Government of India say- -ing that they were independant of the Sultans of Muscat and asking for recognition. These Amirs are not strong enough or influential enough amongst other tribes ts form an independant State without considerable extraneous support, and they have been active in fomenting intri- -gues for this purpose.They have also been attempting to obtain mastery over Sur.a port where they nave a small se h 1161116 n't* Sur is the second largest port in Oman and if tney succeed in bringing it under their control,apart from its value as a source of revenue,they would be pi .oea in a predominant position throughout Sastern Oman. They have evidently deemed the present a favourable time for proclaiming their independance and have hoisted Ibn Saud's flag in their settlement at Sur, established a customs house there and have been interfering with the caravan route to Sharqiyah. There is no evidence that Ibn Baud is connected Kk*j with these developments in any way,but certain members I of the Amirs* family went to Mecca in 1^6 accompu-ied by the Jenebeh Sheixh of Masirah Island who was in alliance with them and just recently one of the Amirs has left for Jeddah presumably £vti the same purpose, whilst the head of another branch of the bultan's fa-Ti family nho a few months ago,stated he was dissatisfied with Isa bin baleh and proposed obtaining aahabi aid,has ■&gt; just returned from a Tisit to Ibn baud. Ibn baud has however been levying zaieat from Baraimi since 1925. Baraimi is the icey to Oman in the north.Its possession would enable the Wahabis to raid the Batinah coast with impunity and with Baraimi and Jaalan in the hands of the mhabis the rest of Oman would fall an easy prey to them Sheiich Isa bin Saleh 1 cannot afford to regard these developments with indifference. He has part icular interests in Bur which is the port for the Bast- -ern portion of the Imam* s territory,including his own tribe,whilst from recent remarics he has made in letters to the Council it is clear tnat he is somewhat nervous of Ibn baud. In the ordinary way it would fern not have been diffi* -cult for nim to deal with the Bani Bu Ali,as he has far greater resources at his disposal,but he is evidently reluctant to do so if it can possibly be avoided. The Bani Bu Ali have been undermining his position with the Ghafiri tribes in his territories* They have openly said in letters to me that if Isa bin Saleh at- -taciced them,the Bani Riyam,Daru and other/ Ghafiri tribes would come to their assistance and so such action on his part would probably lead to a general conflagra- —tion throughout Oman. A state of affairs which would render the country an easy prey for ±bn baud subsequent- -ly and which Isa bin baleh is obviously trying to avoid. It seems also tnat he does not wish to taice any action which might endanger his friendly relations with the bultan's Government and indirectly with us. As regards bur,it was always a turbulant place, having been the centre of the slave trade. A wealc administration, the undermining of the Sultan 1 s authority through French Agency and a blood feud between the sections of the Jenebeh who fzbm themajor portion of the population were factors which roade the place an easy prey for the Amirs 1 machinations. By Befriending the weaJcer side in the blood feud,they obtained control of two of the sections but the^Araaa and iPuwaris sections opposed them and fought tnem^when they attempted to seize the water supply of the town IilijI i-jjiitl Tb r :r we— busy in foltaenting friction between the Muscat authorities and these two sections.The wal^s authority has ceased to exist,Customs officials dare not leave their houses at night and rfbberies and other cri- -mes have taicen place openly and with impunity.

I have now met Political Agent, 1'uscat. He informs me that Isa bin Salih, leader of the Imaiu f s Government of the interior of Oman, has written to the Puacat Council saying that the hoisting of a foreign flag by the Ban! Bu Ali tribe cannot be tolerated and that if the Muscat State does not do something, he will. The Council are greatly worried over this. Isa bin Salih has also written on the subject to the Political *^gent. I have written to Isa bin Salih telling is being him that the matter fexs not fernm neglected, that Ibn 3aud is in treaty with us not to attack Oman and that we wish to tide matters over till the return of the Sultan. My object is to prevent his taking action which may bring about a conflagration. I have since telegraphed to the Council to inform Isa that the main thing for the present is to avoid any fighting which would excite the Ikhwan ana make it difficult for Ibn Saud to control them. I have also written to the Rani Bu Ali Shaikhs telling them that we will not tolerate in Su* any government other than that of the Sultan of Muscat and that they had better display some wisdom. ► Fighting has already started about six miles outside sur between the Bani Bu Ali and a rival tribe, the Bani Bu Hassan, but this is linimportant. The Counoil has gone to Sur with 50 : the State Levy Corps. The Political Agent h* in H 0H00U3 ,, to give moral support. I have told the Political Agent to warn the Council that they must only discuss matters and must not got engaged in any ncg fighting, for which the Muscat State is totally unequipped either in leadership or in numbers. It is hoped and indeed anticipated that my i letters will have effect in holding up matters till the return of the 3ultan. It now appears that of all the tribes of Sur the B&amp;ni Bu All are the least affected by a blockade, but such bolokade would make Sur useless to them, a fact which I have pointed out to them. While the situation is unpleasant similar situations have occurred at Sur many times before and it has no ultimate danger so long as the Ikhwan are not aroused by fighting taking place over the Ikhwan flag. If this were to occur and the Ikhwan could ] not be controlled by Ibn Baud we should have to consider Jd the matter very seriously. This contingency, however, ii yet remote so I will deal with it separately. However remote we must be prepared for it so that if it does occur we will not be taken by surprise.

Its turbulent tribes have however always acknowledged Muscat sovereignty and by a a balance of power and their enmity to the tribes of the interior the Sultan has always been able to draw upon one or the other of them to assist him on payment in time of trouble f and it was the hani Bu All who in 1895 came to Faisal bin Turk!•a assistance when the town of Muscat was occupied by the tribes of the interior. Indeed it has been th© Jenebeh, the anomies of the Ban! Bu All*who have been in general opposed to the sultan. 5. The main points for note in the present sit- -u&amp;tion arise out of the rivalry of these two tribes, the Bu Ml and the Jenebeh. The former are a single political entity acknowledging as their most important Jhalkhs the Amirs of Jaalan} the latter are composed of four sections at Cur namely the M ikhanmh, Jhlalln, niwaris and Aramah. The Makhan&amp;h and the Araaah, the two main sections, have hud a blood feud since 1913.The Ghlalin and the Fuwaria are ooz&amp;par&amp;tlrely uniiaport&amp;nt but the former hare Joined with the hakhannah and the latter with the Aramah* The Amirs of Jaalan in their bid for independ* -anoe and the control of Bur and its hinterland have suoceeded in winning over the Vakhanah and the Ghialin. Thus the Ar&amp;mah and the ?u«&amp;ria are isolated and the Joneheh as a tribe fail to produce the balance of power which has hitherto made it possible for the sultan's weak Government to rule. §• bur is built on the two sides of an inlet of the sea with a channel to the ocean. The Bu All axidui live on one side and the J&amp;nebeh on the other* while the Sultan's Wall's fort is a few miles in the lnterlor» where the water supply exists. 7. The rival sections of the Jenebeh have built forts facing each other and this question has caused considerable fighting between the two parties of the same tribe, a matter which drew me to ttur a year ago. The Joining of the Kakhanah and the Ohlalln with the Bu ill will give the latter a footing on the Jenebeh side of the town upart from giving them a con* in •aidarable preponderance ml numbers • a. In August 1927. tfr. Thomas* the -vasir, went down to liur. His official objects ware to recover a sum of 84 lakhs of rupees due to Khan Bahadur Naslb, the naval ooal contractor and an Important merchant of luacatf and to Induce the tribes to demolish the forts, which were making for fighting and bloodshed« Be came to the conclusion that the \rasaah seotlon were responsible for the opposition to a settle- -ment and accordingly to punish them forfeited a dhow of thetr section and proceeded to tow it away. The4 Tha Aranah then opan^d flr« on the Muscat ttovernmant ship, the *kl Saead' though the/ did not succeed in hitting it* For this act against the 3oTerni&amp;ant they were fined rupees 10,000/- a sua ehich the Muscat Government have been totally unable to recover since they have no force at their disposal* 9* Thus the Araaah were up to this point the villains of the play* But with the new claim of the /Hairs of Ja&amp;lan to independence and to the control of £ur the Arsua&amp;h, with their allies the Fuwaria, are the only persons in that place who acknowledge Muscat sovereignty* At this point a parenthesis is required* Mr* Thomas, the 1v aair of Muscat, has always been deslr- -ous of keeping the Amirs of Jaalan friendly to the Sultan since he considered that without the xxtxXx Amirs* support the sultan could not control sur* Thus ( as it would appear from subsequent events, with- -out the knowledge of the Sultan or the Council ) he wrote a letter, of which the mlr act has produced a cop* asking him to assist in recovering the fine from the *ramah* The Amirs are using this letter as an excuse for having originally come into Sur* 10* The Amirs of Jaalan, in reward for services to saiyid xxxXX Toorki, Sultan of Muscat, were given in from 1370 the personal right of freedom wX customs dues* They have used this purely personal ri^ht as an objection to a customs house of the Sultan's at ur in the past^ they have now introduced their own customs office at Alqah, which is on the Bu All side of the inlet of Sur. 11* The question then arises what action is the Muscat Government going to take to establish their positionposition* It may 1&gt;* notsd that the Political ^gent says that the utmost reinforcement the State oan send for Sur would he about 70 men while the tribes possess siveral thousands of men. For an answer to the question I put I would request a reference to the Sultan*s letter and that of the xmfcxaxKXxXsalifm Council on the result of the aotion of the Amirs of «r&amp;&amp;l&amp;n if permitted to continue uncheck -ed. 12. The Council do not consider that the miro of J&amp;alan can control the situation for they think the other tribes would rise against them and ultimately the country would pass into the hands of the Imamus Govern- -aont of the Interior 9 as other parts of Oman have done* Thus in either event the t uscat State would lost revenue which it oannot afford to do. ♦ Their request is that “with the assistance of the British Government they should proceed oy a man of war The Kusoat Government request H.B*2f # s* Government to support them as they used to support the kuscat Government and their Sultans.' The Sultan is quite frank. He says: • I now request H.B.JPb* Government to afford us strong support in order to prevent the Shaikhs of Bani Bu All from any aotion which they intend to take at ur district as they have no historical right to do so. The pressure which has been brought by the 3ani Bu All on th© Jenojeh is awe to the faot th&amp;t they thikk that we would not get any support from the Government. Tou are well aware that our Government had requested for • help in connection with Sur affairs for a long time past ana w ttuj u t .Ibg^yaraMSS not to ,“fces..aqa -ln^ the customs administration • If the J^nebeh tribe|4&lt;&gt; tribe even now get tbe least assistance from ua tUvjjr would never aubmit to Beni Bu 'll damanda.• If our friend tbe aovanuaent will not attempt to assist ay State in the affairs of Bur the result will be un- •satisfaotory. lou are aware about the opinions of Shaikhs of other tribes in connection with the actions of this tribs, th e wakne as of our .oveymaat of support from our manA s., ’ ( The underlining Is mine*)* Finally the lolitioal ilgent reports • The j loes of revenue from our and the possible deviation or trade from ^usoat to Bur would he a heavy blow to Muscat revenues# The prestige of the lusoat Btate rests on the supporti moral and physical, whioh they are ^ble to obtain from the British Government# without such support the rotate is impotent# ' I am of opinion that unless the State receives some support to enable them to withstand the aggression of the Amirs their authority will diminish not only in J&amp;al&amp;n but also in other parts of their territories*• 13. With Major Murphy’s views it Is impossible to quarrel# ^he independent Btate of Muscat is in reality a fiction. It is an impotent and sterile government, dependent for its ealstenoe in evor&gt; inch of its territ~ -ory upon the goodwill and support of the British Gov- -ernment* *ere it not for this support it would not last for 24 hours but would fall into the hands of bigoted and backward tribes* 14. But Vuaoat and our position there is necessary to ub and we shall thus have to give it the support required and repeat at 3ur what wo have previously done during the last 5C years. Fortunately the tribes are7 are dependent upon the sea to release their output of dates and to bring thee the rioe they eat largely and the olothea they wear. Without the sea they would starve. Thus they can duiokly he brought to sub^ect- •ion. 1ft. It has been an upfcldl task bringing the huooat State into a financial condition of stability though that end is well within view _ _ _ ^ but a lows of revenue would revert It to KX*&amp;£klzyx bankruptcy. The tribes have no respect for it »xc«»pt In so far as th« 3rltlst Oovoraaent creates that reapeet. Id. We aust acoordingly now tell the tribes that we hafe no desire to interfere with them but they cust render unto Caesar that which is Caeaar’a and if they do not we shall have to apply to thorn our sea power and an economic blockade. But having done this we must consider the future. 17. The Oovernmont of India havei in their tole- -gram No. 2034-3, dated X5th October 1923, expressed their views regarding Muscat. be oan indeed contin ue our present policy bet would it not be better to sound ^ench opinion and see whether we could not by agreement terminate the treaty of 1862 and make our relationship with Muscat a closer one in which we could ba certain that we should not one day be left straridad politically and strategically after all we have done ? He annulled part of the same treaty with reference /to Xansibar and can annul the rest. The commercial treaties of America and Holland should not Interfere with this action in any way. With the activity of Persia in the ^ulf, an activity which may be dictated by Russia, it appears to me most undesirable that we should remain exposed to i thethe whim of the Chief who rules. the present Sultan is,though weak and vain,friendly,hut his weakness and vanity could he played upon* Kia father became very difficult at one time and definitely opposed to the British. It is undesirable to risk this occurring again with the unpleasant political yarttmigal position which would arise* Now that the sultan is dependent upon us for the breath he breathes it is, I would suggest, the time to recommend to him and his Council l who would make no difficulty) that our responsibilities in l uscat are so great that he must ask for a position within the ;&lt;mpire for us to continue our assistance.

We consider that,subject to His Majesty*s Government's approval, sanction for the bombardment of Said bin Abdullah's fort by H.M.S. 'CROCUS' should be given provided the senior Naval Officer is satisfied that the shelling can be done effectively and the Resident still considers it necessary in view of general improve- -ment in position indicated in his subsequent telegrams. In the meantime it seems advisable, if Resident agrees, that Muscat should recall Thomas from leave unless the Sultan himself proposes to expedite his return. FOREIGN .£5/134 From Political Resident, Bushire. To Grovemment of India, New Delhi, No. 1095. Repeated Secretary of State for India, No. 1035, with copy for Secretary of State for Colonies, No. 114. Dated 1st November IS£6. (1) . Muscat finances just balance but with constant fear of debit through some source of revenue failing. Payment of partial cost of regiment would at present be impossible but presence of regiment should send up customs revenue. Rs. 30,000/- to &amp;&gt;• 50,000/- could thus be provided and such amount could be earmarked for the purpose. (2) The winter climate of Sur is good and regi- -ment could live in tents. Arrangements similar to those made for regiment at Mattrah could be made and the contractor Engaged then is still in Muscat. (2). While sur is particularly vulnerable to blockade latest reports show that the Bu Ali are the least affected by it, having only some 10 out of 150 ships. The members of Sur tribes who have joined the Bu Ali should however be detached by a blockade and this would restore the balance of power. It would not however have immediate effect as the ships will have left. Thus situation caused by hoisting of Ibn Baud’s flag would not be affected by it till the early summer, when ships return. (4). Tribes of the interior would be satisfied by despatch of Indian troops. It should hold back the Bu Ali and should quiet the general situation and dispose of Wahabi danger. The foregoing refers to your telegram No. 2175-S, October 29th. RESIDENTDated 1st October 1928. 24/134. Politioal Resident, Bushire. Government of India, New Selhi, No. 1096. Secretary of State for India, No. 1096 with copy for Secretary of State for Colonies, No. 115. The following are the three points affect- -ing the question. (1) Helplessness of the Muscat Gov- -ernment (2) Necessity for prevention of anything which would cause Wahahi feelings to he excited in Hasa or Nejd and (3) our ultimate policy in regard to Muscat. 4 If improved circumstances continue the presence of half a battalion with H.M.S. '■Enterprise' would ensure No. (2). It would also give us time to consider No. (3). Question of number of troops finally required can however await report of Political Agent, Muscat, and Senior Naval Officer. Haference (3). Sir Denys Bray and I touched on the question as to whether we could allow Sur to go out of the Sultan’s hands since he could not him- -self hold it. The reply appears to be definitely in the negative. Sur in the ha nds of the Imam’s Govern- -ment would give us more trouble than ever and the Sultan would lose half his revenue since all trade with the interior would be deflected to that port. Thus I see no alternative to holding Sur. The Sultan cannot do it and the question is what is the best method of doing it ourselves. The ultimate despatch of half a battalion would appear then the only solution for the political situation vide paragraph 4 of my accompanying telegram No. 1095, but we can await further report as Political Agent Muscat’s telegrams do not now appear to regard matter as immediate.

They stated Said bin Abdullah's party were still in the fort and had sent word to the wali that the status quo was to be maintained till the return of His Highness the Sultan and that therefore their man who was imprisoned at Muscat should be released by the Council meanwhile.

Ibn baud's flag however was still fly- -ing at Aiqa. In order to comply with the precautions laid down the Council sent a notice to the Fuwaris and others stating the fort was to be bombarded next day and one hour's notice would be given by Ship's whistle in order to enable them to evacuate the women and children in that vicinity.

Sub- -sequently they informed him about the attitude of the Bani bu Ali and the various sections of the Jenebeh* His Excellency expressed a wish to see the Sheikhs of the 4 sections of Jenebeh and also made out a letter to Amir Ma- -hammad bin Baser to come and meet him in muscat.I drew his atten- -tion to your instructions as to the inadvisability of taking action before the return of His Highness but His Excellency stated he was aware of them. The letter was forwarded through the Council of Ministers* At 3.30 p.m* His Excellency having given his permission, and the necessary warning having been given,H*M.3*“Cyclamen* 1 fired 11 rounds with a 4 inch gun at the J*ort.

I had warned the Council on the previous day that His nxceliency was liJcely to ash their opinion as to what they wished him to say to the Sheikhs and so this time they were prepared.

That the Fuwaris should deliver up the 15 men ooncern- _ e d in looting the dhow and other acts and that the hakhana at (Jhialin should cease their relations with the Bani Bu Ali.

In the various letters and telegrams X have 8een f much stress has been laid on the danger of raids by Alchwan tribes and the diffi •culty of their restraint by Ibn baud in coming to the support of the Bani Bu Ali and their flag in case Isa bin Saleh attache the Bani Bu Ali. Is it feared that if we or the Hinawis take action, these tribes will attack Kuwait or the Trucial coast? or is it feared that they will raid Oman? It seems to me that in the latter case they would have to raid B&amp;raimi and the Dhahirah in the first instance. The tribes in the Dhaharah are mostly Ghafiri and opposed to Xsa bin Saleh and it seems a remote possibility that the Akhwan tribes would raid the Dhahirah in order to get even with Xsa bin baleh or with us. It seems to n» a much more dangerous policy to allow Ibn Baud's flag to get firmly established in Jaalan or to leave the situation develop until the Ghafirie and Hinawis come to blows To The Hon'ble Sir Frederick Johnston* A.
