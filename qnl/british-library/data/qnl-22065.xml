ADVIvSER. BAHRAIN STATE.I fee3 Confidential. D.O.No:C/llO. Political Agency, Bahrain,the 21st Noyemher 1931. Pear Colonel, A I enclose for your information a copy of a letter I hare receiyed from the Adviser. Since I expected you on the 24th I did not raise the matter as I hoped to be able to discuss it with you,but now that you are not coming till January urgent action is required. 2. Belgrare has clearly outlined the situation. The acknowledgment of the nebulous title conferred by these scraps of paper signed by Shaikh T Isa would have the most far reaching effects. A large number of Bahama who have them seized from them,or else be askea to pay exorbitant rent rentals. In most cases the area is quite indeterminate and incapable of accurate assessment,and I have no doubt that in most cases when Shaikh ! Isa signed the documents he had not the remotest idea what he was giving away or whether any of it belonged to Bahama or not. 3. So far as I am aware no member of the Al Khalifah lias done anything to improve any of these so called gifts, and none of them take the slightest interest in agriculture except as far as it enables them to rack rent their peasantry Equally none can claim that they spent any money in acquiring these lands. As you know,the whole of their vast landed possessions were taken by force from the Bahama,by means of such a series of outrages that about one-third of the population were forced to emigrate,and it would be a retrograde step in the reforms if other additions were now to be made to their properties at the expense of the tenantry 4. There is another point. Shaikh T Isa is undoubtedly been quietly cultivating little plots of land would findweakening,and once he is out of the way all property is,in theory at any rate,considered to devolve on the ruling Shaikh* If ihese rights are accepted now,there is nothing to prevent the holders of these deeds from selling their properties,and so forestalling any such action. If Shaikh f Isa dies it will be an easy matter to cancel all these scraps of paper,and by so doing ensure that Shaikh Hamad still has some land that he can give his sons,and an opportunity for this Government to acquire what it has never had,a chance to acquire some land revenue by leasing properties capable of development,and also of arranging for their proper development. 5. There is of course no question of the genuine title deeds issued by Shaikh T Isa when plots of land or buildings exchanged hands,or when he made gifts of known areas. In these cases the measurements are known,and they have always been registered,in fact,except for occasions when he gave the same tract or pieces of land to sue or more persons,his seal is the best authotity for a title to land. The matter is,however,a wide one,and it is difficult to dispose of it in correspondence. I would be glad,however,if you could give me a letter for Shaikh Hamad by the down mail saying that you wish to discuss the matter with him,and asking that action be delayed till your arrival. It is impossible for Belgrave to put the matter off any longer,and once another of these documents is recognised the game will be up. * III’ ■■■'■I , ■ii.1l. [ I .1D.O.

A Note on Land Tenure by the Ruling Family in Bahrain# Various notes have been written by me on this subject, which has also been mentioned in the Annual reports, terminating with my C.71 of 19th November 1931. It is universally recognised that the ownership of all land in Bahrain, except what actually belongs to private individuals, is vested in the State. Shaikh Hamed has invariably adhered to this practice and the courts under his authority act on the same assumption by his Orders. The proceeds from state lands, rents and purchase money, are paid directly to the Treasury, rents being credited under '' Rents of Government Lands ^ and proceeds of sales, which are rare, under Miscelaneous receipts ', The establishment of rights of ownership by private persons over property is in almost all cases a simple matter; the ever increasing number of applications for registration of property, if it continues at the present rate, will eventually put an end to the complicated land cases which encumber the courts at present. The inviolability of the Government title deeds, when once they have been issued after due proclamation calling for claims, is now firmly established and the public become more amd more anxious to avail themselves of these documents the possession of which ensures for themselves and their heirs security of tenure and possession. The question of land tenure by the Ruling Family originally arose in connection with this registration work of the Land Settlement Depti Some time after it was first instituted one or two of the Shaikhs produced documents signed by Shaikh Isa, a specimen of which I give belo^ - and on the strength of these documents they claimed very large areas of country which had never been cultivated. The applications were made while Major Daly was in Bahrain^soon after the abdication of Shaikh Isa. I understand that Major Daly refused to admit that these papersGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. established ownership to the ground to which they referred. These documents, under the old rdgime, conferred on the holder the right to levy taxes on the inhabitants of the areas which viere mentioned,at his own discretion; such taxes included fees from fish traps in the sea adjoining the area, taxes on gardens, houses and on brushwood etc; etc: and also, apparently, the right to levy corvee. The unrestricted taxation of the fellahin by members of the Ruling Family was one of the causes of the agitation which culminated in the abdicatio/*- of Shaikh Isa^and the Civil List, which was started soon after that event,more than compensated the Khalifah for their loss of feudal rights over the Bahama. For some time after liajor Laly’s departure no action was taken in the matter btofefr but about eighteen months or two years ago various applications were made by members of the Ruling Family for registration of titles and of sales depending on the interpretation of Si^aikh Isa’s gift documents. These registrations were held up, with one exception, an action which has caused considerable unpleasantness, until finally Shaikh hamed was asked to postpone the whole question till it can be fully discussed. to a point some five miles beyond Zellag and from iianaraa, on the other coast, to Seddad, also the open ground in Sitra island. It is, in fact, all the open country between the various groups of date gardens on the north end of the island, with the exception of the plain below the tombs at Aali. It includes all open country y\ which the two roads run to the garden of Mohamed Yatim at Berber, and the plain betwee/i- Berber and Budeya,the open country between Aali and Kurzakhan, Kurzakhan and Seddad and Seddad and Zellag, and all the vicinity of Manama outside the Municipal boundary with the district known as Jaffair opposite the site which was at one time considered as a deep water harbour. The area concerned is a very large one. It includes roughly the whole water bearing area along the coast of Bahrain island, from Manama Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa, Shaikh Hamed’s eldest brother, and his son are the most pressing applicants at present having sold some ofummii ——aS9”*SiMfr** \h&gt; GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. the ground in question to some foreign merchants in .Bahrain• fneir sales consist of land at Hahooz, on the southern edge of Manama, and a large tract of country at Berber which is further complicated by the fact that it includes a number of little gardens claimed by the local inhabitants but which the seller considers^, as belonging to him. Shaikh Mohamed also applies for the registration of the district of daflair. In most applications for registration the Khalifah admit that although in cases gardens a,nd whole villages are within the area which they claim they only assert ownership over open ground, not oId gardens and buildings. Shaikh Sulman bin H&amp;med is also pressing for the registration of -I three large districts in the neighbourhood of Budeya. He however claims also the sea opposite this country and the rights to levy taxes on land and water over buildings, fish traps and cultivation at will. This application introduces possibilities which are sufficently serious for holding up all the other applications, should it be thought necessary to provide an excuse. The ownership of these lands is based on scraps of paper eminating from Shaikh Isa and issued during the last fifteen to twenty years. The following is a typical example. ' I say,and I am Isa bin Ali, that I have gifted to the boy the sehah which is called and its purtenances, a gift made by me in good health and of my free will and this paper has been written to make it known so that nothing shall be hidden. * The word SEHAH means a flow of water but has been construed to mean-a mean a district. Few of the documents contain any boundaries, but in some cases the sehah is described as the country between and including certain villages or gardens. There are never any measurements. These documents were issued many years before the introduction of artesian wells and I believe myself that they were only intended, at the time to carry with them the rights to levy taxes over the areas concerned and perhaps grazing rights as well. Now that the possibility of finding water, and perhaps oil, is known to the holders of the documents they wish to sbtain actual ownership of the ground.I GOVERNMENT OP BAHRAIN. There is another point which might be considered and which is admitted, grudgingly, by the Ruling Family. According to the tribal law of the Khalifah on the death of any member of the family all the lands which have been at any time gifted to him by the Ruler revert custom was enforced by Shaikh Isa until comparatively recently. It is a species of feudal tenure and well calculated to increase the power of J -the Rulere Shaikh Hamed would not be averse to practising it, he has m fact mentioned it to me on more than one occasion with reference to one of his elderly relations* Another suggestion is that if the ownership is admitted a land tax should be imposed sn uncultivated land privately owned ^ f ^^^ ai;Lure to pay within a defined period should entail appropriation^/ the State. In normal times the State would be capable of cultivating a portion of such land, though at present^, owing to the financial position/this is impossible. An allotment system could possibly be introduced on land of automatically to the Ruler, that is to say to the reigning shaikh, who can, and actually did, dispose of it as he wishes, either sequestering it all or granting a portion of it to the heirs of the deceased This this natureD.0.No:35.

(*)I cannot trace any specific mention oi me customs referred to oy His Hxceilency S&amp;aiim Hamad,but,having regard to the nature oi the meeting,they may well nave been mentioned. Yours sincerely, Dalrymp Advi *jm^le Belgrave Esquire. Adviser to me Banram Government, Bahrain.$ On the evening of the 3rd July 1933 His Jixcellency Shaikh Hamad ajid the Advipjer to the Bahrain Government (Mr .Belgrave) came to tea,after which there was a discussion about finances. 2. I reminded Shaikh Hamad that the last year’s actuaJLs included a deficit of over Rs.70,000/-; that this ha,d been met from the reserve; but that at this rate the reserve will vanish in a very short time. The Shaikh replied that if God was willing Royalties from oil would make things right. 3. We passed on to the subject of the Al Khalifah lands and reversion of Al Khalifah property to the Ruler on the death of the holder. The Shaikh is anxious to let Shaikh Abdullah sell the piece of land which he has promised to the tyusaibis on the ground that it is not of any particular value,but if this is so why should Qusaibi offer Rs. 10,5)00/- for it. As regards the reversion of lands the Shaikh made a sugg ay cover the difficulties,that is to say,that the ember of the Family who dies should be held to revert to the Rule^/and that a Family majlis consisting of Shaikh Mhhammad,Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman should consider what distribution of the would be suitable. The Shaikh said that if a man had no heirs then it might revert natueally to the Ruler. If,on the other hand,he had a number of sons,it would be necessary to make some provision for them. In the case of daughters,the estate would not be allowed to go outside the Al Khalifah Family, £2*9 ^ry n 'LAs' , 4. It was,of course,useless to discuss the deficit in the budget,because of the probability of some payment from oil, though I emphasised that even ijf there was the full Mining Lease payment,it would not^probably^wipe out the deficit. 5. It is a pity that the Shaikh should wish to let Shaikh Abdullah sell this particular piece of land as it will set a bad precedent and the Shaikh himself wa.s the first to raise the objection to Shaikh Abdullah’s doing this. However,if some formula can be found by which the principle of not selling is upheld,and an exception made for some reason,which will not provide a precedent for others,it might save a lot ofunpleasantness if they were to make an exception in this case. 6 e I think that the idea of a Family Majlis has much to recommend it. The idea is that the finding of the Majlis shall he confirmed (or not,as the case may he) with the seal of the Ruler. It is possible that the difficulties now raised hy Shaikh Muhammad might he met hy the Majlis making a distribution of his A1 Khalifah property and aiy the distribution so agreed upon to te recognised hy Shaikh Kamad. In any case,even if an ideal solution is not reached,it has the sterling merit of being their own solution and not that of the Agency. 7. I discussed the matter afterwards with kr.Belgrave and we think on the whole,that a letter to the Shaikh about the conversation,couched in general terms,might he of value to him. 8. In the course of the conversation the Shaikh raised with enthusiasm the question of the possibility,if money was forth coming, of his going on a pleasure trip either to India,the Lehanons or to London. I gather that this idea is an hardy annual. Of course,in the past he used to go every year to Lingeh or some where on the Persian coast for hawking. It would probably be a good thing when air and oil matters are settled^- 4-7-1933./ oU ^, 5 O'.; RcCPIPT^.’t’i. ^ ?• '-O' ^Ersbl^^ Bahrain, July 4, 1933.

There were two other natters of which m spoke. Tbs first matter was certain difficulties which hove arisen in giving effect to the ancient custom that land of the Al Khali feh gifted to a neabe of the Family reverts to the haler on the death of the person to whom it has been gifted. Your ancellency suggested that a family Council night be called together, consisting at present of Your brothers, our fill ends, Ghaikh Uuhsst.ad bin 'Isa, dhaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa end Your doselleney's son, our friend Ghalkh Salma bin Hemal. They would consider bow much should be given to the femily of the deceased in order that the members night : not feel want and how much should revert to the Kuler, and after they have writees down what in their opinion was just and fair. Your dneelleney would consider it) «d if you also considered that the distribution which they had eug acted wm just and fair, you would affix your oeal to it, so that all might know what had been dons and that it was dens with Your Jxeelleney'a approval. Thus the princip: would have been anintained that the lend had reverted to the Huler, yet an errant sent would exist for ensuring that the dependents of the deceased,if in need, should be given a fair share according_ r _ their necessity. 4 # The second natter was that of the sale of land belonging to the A1 Khalifah by a member of the A1 Khalifah Family to a persoi h not a member of the Al Khalifah Family* As Your Excellency has stated and as is veil known f the old custom is that land load belonging to the Al Khalifah can olnj r be sold to a member of the Al Khalifah Family* The reason for establishing this custom was doubtless to prevent the Al Khalifah gradually disposing of their land to rieh men in times of difficulty, or to prevent them from squandering their property, so that they would become poor and make it necessary for the Ruler to support them. In fact the custom is meant to prte nt the Al Khalifah gardually becoming landless and poor, and so unable to maintain thea. selves in a dignified way as Rulers of Bahrain* I would strongly counsel Your y* Sj t«Jl «j-» •» jiXf Cr* -»r aiU, w ,i V u, !&gt; vP*'* ,i I Cr* 5J LJ * iSUi* *lfi} ^ O* #i«fc at- ua) fr- kJLWiy'W 1 fr^ v r^r* jaxeellency not to allow any deviation from cf^ this custom.

I hope, however, f that Your Excellency will be able to come to some understanding about them.

But if Your Excellency does permit this to be done, I would advise Your Excellency again to issue an 'Alan, so that all people may know and may not be misled, that in the future no case of a sale of land belonging to the A1 Khalifah to a person who is not of the Al Kh&amp;lifah family will be recognis ed. By this means the wealth and power of the ruling Family will, if God is willing, be preserved. Usual Endings. Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain. »C’s. P. P.—L (in) 980—300-12-29—c.

Could you please send your reply in duplicate as 1 would like to send a copy to Bushire. Yours sincerely. C.Dalrymple Belgrade Esquire, Adviser to the Bahrain Government Bahrain.$. Mo. ps D .©.No. c.?r A Secretariat, Bahrain, Aug, 10, 193 ;n|o Dear Gastrell, There are several points in His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's letter^dated 5th Rabi al Thany 1352, regarding finances and Khalifah estates which I think require some further explanation. V The letter was composed and written by Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa. Para 2, line 7. This imnlies that the Civil list will be increased when revenue improves (from oil) by payment from government funds. It has now been definitely agreed that l/3rd of all royalties will be paid to H. E. Shaikh Hamad himself. Perhaps it might be as well if in reply to this letter some slight suggestion was inserted implying that it will be in Shaikh Hamad's power to increase the allowances of any of his relations out of the royalty from oil which we hope that he will receive. ^ Para 2, line 11. No reduction was made in the monthly amount paid to Shaikh Hamad when the 2*$ cut was made although when by H. E. Shaikh Hamad's orders the matter was discussed by me with Shaikhs Mohomed Abdullah and Sulman they all insisted that Shaikh Hamad's emoluments should be cut in a similar way to theirs. The Ramadan allowance (Rs 2,000/-) was not allowed for in the budget for 1351 as no funds were available. •x /Although H. E. Shaikh Hamad was aware that no provision for it had been made he gave me orders to pay it and to debit it against his own account. Some of the amount is paid to his own sons. Line 19. In the early days fcf Shaikh Hamad r s reign several increases were made in his monthly emolument. On one occasion, during Major Daly^ time, it was increased in order to cover the cost of public entertaining and I believe particulars of this exist in the Agency files. Page 3, line 7^ The exnression 'open land' sale, is very vague. In the recent/mentioned in this letter, by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, the description 'open land' was used as applying to a very valuable piece of ground, watered from Adari, on which lucerne was cultivated which was bought by Gozaibi for Rs 10,000/-. I think 'open land' should be more clearly defined; it could be stipulated that'open land' means land which has no water rights and which does not produce any rent. Artesian wells enable owners of such land to cultivate. Page 4. Shaikh Mohomed has strongly opposed this matter since it has been under discussion but lately he agreed to support Shaikh Hamad on the condition that he and his sons would not be affected in any way. If this concession is granted it must be granted also to Shaikh Abdullah and to Shaikh Khalifah bin Sulman and their heirs, in fact to the immediate male heirs of Shaikh Isa. ^ I suggest that it would be as well to approve of Shaikh Hamad granting this concession only in the-3- the case of gardens or ground which are actually being cultivated by them at the time of the death of the holders of the gifted property. claims which Shaikh Mo homed and certain others of the Khalifah make over huge tracts of country, including whole villages and foreshore, which they ;plaim to own by right of 'hiba 77 papers over 'sehat 77 . I have frequently referred to this matter in letters to the Agency. In past times Shaikh Isa used to write on scraps of paper that he gifted the district of so and so to one of his sons or grandsons. In those days open ground was valueless as it could not be irrigated. The gift conveyed rights of independent taxation and various other feudal usages all of which are now extinct. Some of the Khalifah who retain these documents now argue that the gifts of whole districts in Bahrain convey the actual ownership of all the ground, except that which is privately owned, within the Tl sehat n . In some places the local Bahama have cultivated patches of ground within these areas and in some cases the Shaikh who holds the hiba demands that they should be ejected and their gardens taken over by him. The Bahrain court is now dealing with several cases of this description. n ■O This would do much towards settling the vague Yours sincerely, Uaptam (iastr Political Agent, Bahrain. Captain E. Gastrell, I.A.,Confidential . D.O.No:C/401-1.to/7. ' Political Agency, Bahrain,the 6th Septemtoer 1933. Dear Colonel Loch, Please refer to Hie Excellency Shaikh Hamad*s ^ t £ 3. suo: &lt;41 letter dated the 5th Ratoi* al Awwal 1352 to your address, forwarded to you under Printed Letter No:C/341-1.to/7 dated the 17th August 1933. 2. Belgrave asked me in confidence the other day whether any reply had toeen received from you,as he knew that pressure was toeing torought to toear on Shaikh Hamad to agree to the demands of his brothers,especially Muhammad,and he feared that if nothing was received soon, the Shaikh would give way to them. Their attitude is that in the absence of any reply from you (not that the Shaikh*s letter really needed a reply,so tfc*t maintain) they presumed you concurred with their schemes. 3. In the meantime to prevent any such action,! have thought it necessary to write to His Excellency to the effect that you hope to toe able to reply to his enquiries at an early date,and I hope you will approve of this move toy me. Yours sincerely. The Hon’tole Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch,I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Translation of letter dated nil(received on 8o4«1934) from His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifah,C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrain to Colonel Loch, Political Agent, Bahrain. fry s iS' . /JV , fL ih\b* After Compliments, “i. With reference to our conversation on the subject of which I wrote you a reply to your letter Ho.?26 dated the 10th July 1934^ equivalent to 17th Rabi f ,I, 1352. This is to inform you that, as was previously mention ed by me, my opinion is that we the descendants of our late father Shaikh ’Isa namely myself, my brothers Shaikh Muhammad and Shaikh ’Abdullah and our nephew ShaiMi Khal fc fufl, rnp.r&gt;, shall have the right over our property which came to our possession from our late father and that our sons shall have the right to enjoy the same after us. As regards the rest of the Al Khalifah whenever any of them dies his property should . revert to tne ruler in accordance with rule established by our late father. In my opinion a council may be formed to look into the state of the family of the deceased and consider what they deserve to get from the estate of the deceased. The council should consist of my brothers Shaikh Muhammad and Shaikh ’Abdullah, Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman and of my son Shaikh Salman, who should fix the amount they(the family of the deceased) should get from the estate of their father and the rest oi the estate snould revert to the Ruler. When they give their decision about the esta.te they should refer the matter x to the Ruler who will approve of their opinion. The second matter is regarding the sale. In my opinion that no property belonging to the Al Khalifah should be sold except among the Al Khalifah themselves so that their property may remain in their possession a*nd not taken away by the rich foreign merchants, except when any of them wishes to sell any property out of which he does not get any income or benefit in which case he should write a letter to the Bahrain Government who will call together my above mentioned brothers and sons to look into the matter• If they r consider that it is desirable to dispose of the property with the object of replacing it with a better one they should refer the natter to me giving their opinion atout^hen permission will be givenS. /to. 47^1 The Hesidency, Bushire, 13th October 19 33, My dear Gastrell, S.Ac'.lfb eference to your demi-official letter tto.C/401-l.b/7 dated the 6th September 19 33, I ^ iu^b IZ S. enclose a letter Ho.336 dated the 7th October 1933 about financial and cognate arrangements in Bahrain, for delivery to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin 1 ^'’Isa A1 Khalifah, if you agree that the terms are suitable.

Saqr bin Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Wahab A1 £halifah, and 2. Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Wahab A1 Khalifah and his mother Rata bint Abdullah, for the sale of certain pieces of their land, the reason being the owners’ need of ready money.

Dear Colonel Loch, _ _ _ TT With reference to your letter to Shaikh Hamed regarding Khalifah property, of which I have not got a copy, Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulraan came to see me about it and pointed out that according to the wording of the letter^ the land which is to remain their property absolutely, and to oe inherited by their descendants, is the property which they INHERITED from Shaikh Isa. Of Shaikh Isa’s sons only Shaikh Hamed inherited any similar this point would oe covered. 2 Shaikh Mohammed, who has visited me daily since the arrival of the letter, asks me to bring other points to your no t i c © • it a' Only gardens and houses are mentioned ■whereas the people concerned own much bazaar property which was gifted to them by _ Shaikh Isa, he asks that the word ' agarat should be used, which covers shops etc. _ ^ ^ tign He considers that Shaikh Khalifah bin Sulman should be included. ■ ^. _ , . ,, , .^ MQtt He asks for some latitude in the stipulation that ii anyone is allowed to sell property by permission of the Committee he must buy new property of equal value.^ Shaikh Mohammed argues that the seller might wish to improve existing property with n proceeds of sale. He says it would be impossible to buy new pronerty of exactly equal value to the property which was sola. hqh He wishes you and me to sign some documents which ne wrote and which he persuaded Shaikh Hamed to sign granting the exemption to the family rule to the three Shaikhs concerned, but these documents mention ' hibas ' and if they were signed the principle of ” hibas !’ gifting large districts to certain Snaixhs f would be admitted. r Shaikh Mohammed is very persistent in this matter and i ^ should be grateful if you could possibly consider the points which he raises before you leave, I think he will mention them to you tomorrow.Bahrain, Qcsicrber 2, 1935. }# Dear Colonel Loch, With reference to the question of ’hibas 1 and inheritance by meiabers of the Ruling Family, your letter No. C/188 of 20th March 1935 has, I think, satisfied the Shaikhs provided that some slight alterations can be made in the wording. 2. On page 2 line 14 you mention n houses gardens and cultivated lands'. This ignores shops, bazaars, fish traps and market property. It is suggested that a word should be intro duced which embraces all town property such as the Arabic word 'aqarat' which covers houses, bazaar property etc. I think that this sug gestion is a sound one if the sentence could then read 'gardens, cultivated lands, fish traps and immoveable house property'. 3. Owing to work at Jufair it has been impossible to start the survey of the Khalifah property which is a very lengthy undertaking. 4. It is suggested that para 1, page 3, should be modified. Shaikh Mo homed bin Isa points out that it is unlikely that anyone jf would sell property, 'out of which he does not get any income or benefit' because nobody would buy such property. He asks that this clause should —should be omitted because it is covered by the necessity of obtaining permission to sell which rests with the committee. He N I/O also says that it impossible to ensure that a person who sells shall purchase other property exactly of the same value as that which he disposed of. This point I think is a mere quibble. I enclose a note showing the results of the present arrangement • In fact I think the appointment of the committee has had the effect of a brake on the sale of land by the Khalifah but as you will see almost eveiy sale has been allowed and in most cases no condition has been made by which the seller has had to purchase new property with the proceeds of the sale.

To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain* BAHRAIN ST1.TE* Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the policy to be pursued by the Bahrain Government in using their revenue from oi^. royalties# 2. Now that oil has been won in considerable quantities and that a refinery has been established in Bahrain (end is being extended), it is safe to infer that the Bahrain Petroleum Company intend to work their concession in earnest i and that a large yearly sum will accrue to the Banrain Government in royalties for some ti ie to come* One third of the total royalties is handed to the bhuikn for the A1 Khalifah family and two thirds go into the revenue of the Bahrain Government. It cannot, however, in the nature of things be expected that the revenue from oil royalties will continue for more than a limited period* The supply of oil \ in the field may diminish and v/ill someday in any case fail: and conditions of the market may change. It is essential that the Bahrain Government should face this fact from the outset3. The best opinion obtainable is to the effect that the pearl trade is likely to improve, but never to reach again its old great prosperity, so that it is not safe for the Bahrain Government to count on any great revenue from pearls in the future♦ 4. The first step that is necessary in order to safe guard the future is to build up &amp; solid reserve, which will then automatically increase as the years go by. The process has aireuuy been begun, and the total amount to be accumulated as a reserve will be considered separately. 5. There are also certain important measures for the betterment of the people, such as the faiti-malaria campaign, sanitation and water supply in Manemah and Muharraq, education, ^ ' MM riH IBM. ^ j irrigation and so on, for which money will no doubt be allotted in the ordinary course of administration. 6 . But ell these activities (and, indeed, the continuanci of the reserve) depend on the revenue from oil royalties, and provision must be made for the days when it fails. 7. VJhatever else may be an immediate source of wealth, ultinic tely it is on the land that mankind depends for existence. 8 . Tie A1 Khalifah have a wise custom that land belonging to members of the A1 Khalifah can only be alienated to another member of the family. Some of them, being feckless and extravagant, do their best to evade this rule and some wish to sell for sound reasons. Recently, therefore, a Committee consisting of Chaikh Muliammc.d bin ’Isa, Shaikh ’Abdullah bin ’Isa and ‘-haikh d^iaian bin Hamad was established to consider cases in which members of the A1 Khalifah wish to sell land to persons not of the A1 Khalifeh Family. The Committee report to the Ruler, who may or may not follow their advice.advice. The Political Agent tries to influence all in the direction of retaining the land in the Family, 9* From time to tine I have discussed with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government the possibility of the Bahrain Govern ment intervening in such cases (if it were thought desirable to do so in order to save any particular piece of land) and buying the land, ^he ownership would then vest in the Bahrain Government, as opposed to the Ai Kh&amp;lifch as a family, and the Government would administer it. Till now it has not been possible to develop the idea owing to lack of funds. 10, . I suggest that this system of buying by the Bahrain Government might now be adopted and extended to land, other than that of the Al Khalil ah, which may from time to tir e come into the market, if it can be obtained at a reasonable figure. 11. The effect in time would be to make the Bahrain Govern ment a considerable landowner and to ensure a new and more or less permanent source of revenue for itself and of employment and good food for its peoole, when and if the revenue from oil follows th t from the pearl trade. 12* At one ti e the Bahrain Government had in their employ a Director of Agriculture, a Syrian, who did good work so far as was permitted by the meagre funds at his disposal. The post had to be done away v:ith during the recent financial crisis, but the Adviser has under consideration the question of reviving it, now that money is available. I would recommend that the appointment should be made and a strong agricultural staff be collected to deal with agriculture in general and with the Baiirain Government lands in particular. 13. There is much room for improvement in date farming and agriculture, and for the introduction of new fruits and vegetables, and I would like to see agriculture and cow.sheep and go; t faming administered together, v.lth a view to building up a better diet for the people. I do not think that there is anything into which the Bahrain Government could better put their money. 14. Examples of the possibilities are (a) that about six years ago the idea of using manure for the dr te gardens was tried for the first Lire and is non widely used (so far as manure is available ); (b) that oranges introduced into the She!this gardens from t Iraq have borne fruit in a ray which suggests that an industry could be started, which would add oranges to the locel diet; and (c) fci t tobacco growing has been started and it is .‘morn that cotton can be grown* 15. I recommend, therefore, that the Bahrain Government shoula be advised to adopt as a policy:- (i) the purchase of land, both of the A1 Kh&amp;lifdh (when compelled to sell by poverty or other go &gt;d cause) and of ordinary owners as suitable opportunities offer and (ii) tnat a directorate of Agriculture be re-established and charged (a) with the administration of the Bahrain Government lands either themselves or through suitable tenants, (b) with the improvement of agriculture (including date trees and introduction of new lines) and (c) with the improvement of animals giving meat and milk (cows, goats, sheep, poultry). 16. I would add that I have discussed this proposal informally with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Mr. C.D. Belgr^ve, C.B.I.), who cordially agrees with it in principle. V;e both appreciate that the most careful organisation and the gradual building up of a first class* - 5 - staff be necessary if success is to be achieved, but before placing the mutter before His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ! Isa Ai iQialifcJb. or taking any other action, I should be glad of your general approval* I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. bieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain,N0.86&amp;-5 of 1936. Brit ish Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 8th December 193 6. (&lt;&gt;75 Subjects Financial policy of Bahrain State. Reference your letter No.C-490 dated the 17th November 1936 in which you suggest the building up of a solid reserve (paragraph 4) and the proposals (i) and (ii) of your paragraph 15. 2. In regard to the reserve I entirely concur and the Bahrain Government should be encouraged to build this up,, 3. With regard to your proposals in paragraph 15 ( i) and (ii). Some years ago, when the Bahrain Government wished to discover what the possibilities of their customs revenue might be and to reorganize their Customs Department, they procured an expert of the Indian Customs Service, who visited Bahrain for a short period, and on whose report the Bahrain Government took action with very profitable results. 4* On the same analogy the first step in the present instance seems to me, before the Bahrain Government begin to purchase land, which may or may not be cultivable, and before any Directorate of Agriculture is established, which may or may not be worth its expenditure, it would be as well to obtain the advice of a first class agricultural expert, who should visit Bahrain for a month or two and draw up a detailed report on what local possibilities there are. When this /this is ascertained the Bahrain Government will then be in a position to take useful action, 5. You will remember that I discussed this proposal with you and the Adviser and we agreed that it should be carried out. 6. Please therefore give Mr, Belgrave any assistance he may require in procuring a suitable individual, and keep me informed. sd. T.C.Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Bahrain seems as regards rain and also salt in the soil to be pretty much like Sibi - maximum temperature about 110°. No frost. Cap tain Hickinbotham wants to go into the question of the possi bility of raising vegetables and cereals. The water is ar tesian, somewhat salt on the Coast, but fresh inland. Money would be available for development if a profit is probable. As you, and also the people in Sind, are familiar with similar problems, I have suggested to Captain Hickin botham that he should get in touch with you. From what I have heard I think that, in addition to vegetables and cereals, there will be room at Bahrain,and elsewhere in the Gulf, for shafkl etc. to get salt out of the soil and to make manure and for mesquite of various kinds both for fuel and to serve as wind breaks. I hope all is well with you and family. Yours sincerely, Sd/- B.J.Gould. 1. What about grapes^ 2. An A.A. may be wanted -r.O. lio. C/466-t.b/7 Dated the 21st June 1937 hear Mi-.

Bear Captain Hickinbotham, U7 Kindly refer to your D.O. letter Wo a C/466-l.b/7 dated the 21st June 1937. The Fruit Experiment Station at Quetta is a Government Show and I am the Agricultural Officer in Baluchistan belonging to the Indian Agricultural Service. Ap^rt from the Fruit Experiment Station at Quetta we have a 300 acres Seed Farm about 100 miles south of Sibi, which is mainly devoted to experiments on the cultivation of wheat, cotton, oil-seeds etc etc* /Ve are further engaged in developing a 100 acres vineyard and a 50 acres almond- grove in the uplands of Baluchistan. In short we have here a small department of Agriculture which I have been responsible in creating to help to develop the Agro- Horticultural resources of this Province. This is just to give you an idea about your querry as to what the Experiment Farm in Baluchistan is and whether it is a Government controlled organization. I find that the Bahrain Government are anxious to obtain the services of an Agricultural Expert for a month or so with a view to examine the Island and to advise them about developing its Agricultural resources. I dare say the Government of India will be able to send out some one to help you in the matter in due course. Mr Gould's letter gives me some clue to the kind of problem you have but if possible I would like to have further details of your climate, rainfall, irrigation system and the soil. Also for my own personal interest^ I would like to know what language is spoken in the Island. I understand that your soil is Alkaline that is it contains lot of injurious salts. Pending the arrival of an hExpert that the Government of India may be able to send out, may I su^^est that you will be well advised to send samples of your soil from various places in the Island, in canisters to the Imperial Agricultural Chemist, Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research, New Delhi with a request to have it chemically examined and favour you with his report. This analysis will be oi considerable help to any exoert who may be deputed later on to advise your Government on developing Agriculture in your Island. Each soil sample should be of one cubic foot and should be thoroughly mixed together. Apart from the problem of soil amelioration , you will have to face the difficulty of counter-acting the etiects of sea breezes laden with salts. /&gt; It will be interesting to know what is grown there at present. Also I would suggest your making a collection of the flora of the Island. Have your specimens put in between two sheets of blotting paper and put it in a wooden press for a few d^ys until they have dried up. These then can be sent to us if you so desire and we will get them identified for you. This information will^dln additional A help to the Agricultural Expert in advising the right things to grow. I would further suggest your getting in touch with Dr. ?/.

Climate and Rain 1 fall. Water. Soil is of sandy character with occasional patches of more fertile land, very calcareous, after watering new land patches of salt are vi sible on surface, this usually continues for several months after new ground is put under cultivation. In certain areas gypsum is found in the soil close to the surface. A limited quantity of manure is available from cows and camels and from old rubbish heaps in villages. During recent years the contents of cess pits have been used for manuring gardens by local Arabs. Vegetable manure is never used as all dry brush wood etc., is collected for fuel. Average temperature from 61 in January to 92 in August, maximum temperatures 54 to 130, the latter temperature obtaining inland on the desert area in the centre of the island. Humidity is very high, especially near the sea, from May to September, the season for planting and growing seeds, vegetable and flowers, is 0c- tober-May, during the hot months no seeds will grow. Average rainfall is about 3 inches, maximum during recent years 8 inches. Rain falls bet ween December and March. Wind velocity, during winter months, is very high. Sandstorms are almost non existent. Water is from natural springs and artesian wills and is very slightly brackish. Irrigation is by water channels extending from a central tank and local cultivatE^i flood each bed daily, which system makes it difficult to grow small delicate seedlings.

They say it will not be possible to relieve him from his present post until the beginning of January next, but I that assume^/this will not cause you inconvenience and that if you decide to apply formally for the loan of his services you would be content if he arrived &amp;ny time during January. 2.

I pre sume that he has a passport duly vis’d for Bahrain. You will find the Rest House very comfortable and it is managed by a Goanese who will be able to give your peon instructions in a language that he can understand. 2. It is a little difficult to advise you exactly on the kind of clothing you will require here. I would however ad vise you to bring a few warm clothes, though by the beginning of Narch it should be fairly warm in Bahrain and ordinarily you will want summer clothing. Naturally you will be doing a good deal of investigation in the villages, and you will want thin out-door clothes for that purpose. You will of course be provided with a car and an interpreter, so you need not anticipate any difficulties in making your researches here. 3. I do not think there is any suggestion that I can make before your arrival. You will be met when you land and I suggest that you should make a beginning on the following day by calling on Mr. Dalrymple Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bah rain Government, with whom you will be able to arrange your programme.

Adviser to the Government.Information on soil sent to Imperial Agricultural Chemist, New Delhi. Sample No. 1 . The greater part of the soil in this sample is under cultivation. There are large gardens in which dates predominate. Orange, Banana, Loz, Papaya, Carrot, Ouava, «»ater melon and Lucerne are also cultivated in them. Potato was recently tried in this soil and has proved successful. Sucp crops as wheat, rice, barley, sugar care and cotton do not exist in any quantity. The soil is irrigated by natural springs and artesian wells. Samples Nos. 2 and 3 . The soil is not under cultivation. Sample i^o. 4 (aj and (b) . The major portion of the land is not under cultivation, but few patches of not more than 12 acres each were recently culti vated and it appears that the result is satisfactory. Date palms and lucerne haye been grown, the former are too young for judgment while the latter is healthy and thriving. Sample No. 5 . This sample was taken from a cul tivated tract where only dates and lucerne are grown. No attempt has so far been made to raise any other crop. Tae major portion of this area is virgin soil. Sample No. 6 . The land is not cultivated but date gardens at a short distance from tnis tract have, in addition to magnilicent date palms, a very Lealthy growth of lucerne, banana ana tomato plantations. The soil under cultivation and that from which this sample —- 2 - sample is taken are identical. The lana is irri gated by artesian wells and natural springs. Kainfall . The average rainfall is about three inches. maximum recorded during recent years is 8 inches. xiain falls between December and march. Tne velocity of wind during winter montns is very high. Sandstorms do not exist. manures, manure from cows, camels donkeys and horses is used out this is not available in suffi cient quantities. Fish scrap is also available and is occasionally used. (general. The main lines on which improve ment is desired to be Effected on the soils under consideration, cannot be definitely stated at this state. The nature and extent of present culti vations do not provide sufficient data for the deter mination oi these lines. broadly speaking however, a scientific treatment is required to set up such chemical action in the soil without which there can be no real sustenance for the plant. The soil is generally sandy and contains a large percentage of salt, frequently appearing as a white deposit on the surface of the ground. This can be washed out by regulating the drainage system in the fields, but something more is required to counteract the effects of this salt on the soil. 1 *— ryl 0 By Air Mall .

No. 196/S.P Bahrain, March 28, 1938 Dear Weightman, A matter, which until now has Been conve niently shelved, is likely to soon require con sideration, that is the question of the Khalifah ancestral estates. There has been a good deal of correspondence about this matter concluding I think with your D.O. No. C/40 of March 6, 1932. 2. The present case is a claim made by Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, on behalf of his eldest the golf course including the whole village of Adilabad which is occupied by foreign subjects, Persians and manumitted slaves. Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa has a document from Shaikh Isa granting t his son the sehat of Mahooz, which according to Shaikh Mohomed, includes the ownership of the village in question. He now wishes to sell this area and to evict the villagers or cause them to pay rent, which they have never paid in the past. 3. In the first place Shaikh Mohomed’s son is well provided for financially and does not need to sell what he alleges to be his property, second it would, in my opinion, be unjust to turn out the villagers who are an exceptionally poor community. 4. Shaikh Mohomed alleges that the Persians and slaves were made to reside there by Daly who % ' \ son, who is a mental invalid, to the ownership of a large area of land along the west side of agreedA- 2 - /N agreed that Shaikh Mohomed should be compensated for the use of his ground. Actually Daly never admitted the validity of the ’'hiba' papers dis tributed by Shaikh Isa. 5.

The Imperial Agricultural Chemist, Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, MEW D ELH I. To The Political Agent, BAHRAIN . ^PERSIAN GULF) Dated Nev; Delhi . the April 193&amp; . Subject Sir, With reference to your letter No.C/133-1.b/7, dated, the 15th February 1938, forwarding certain soils for analysis, I have the honour to enclose herev/ith the results of analyses and my report thereon. SD/8.4. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, IMPERIAL AGRICULTURAL CHEMIST.MECHAITICAL AITALYSIS. Mechanical analysis of soil No.3, which only could be dispersed by sodium chloride treatment (Puri method).- Clay (•002 m.m. and below) 27.58% Very fine silt (.002 m.m. to .005). 14.46% Fine silt + silt (.005 to .02 m.m.)... 36.06% Very fine sand (.02 m.m. to .05 m.m.) 15.06% Coarser fraction &amp; loss on solution 6.84% The soils are apparently derived from limestone and argillaceous rocks and are characterised by large amounts of gypsum and are all alkaline in reaction. Soils 1, 2 and 4a are more or less similar and are characterised by large quantities of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate. The Total Solids t^matter soluble in water)are also high. Soil No.3 is unique in itself compared to the other three soils and contains a comparatively small percentage of gypsum and a smaller percentage of Total Solids. On account of the higher content of salts and on account of the fact that gypsum hinders dispersion of soils 1, 2 and 4a, mechanical analysis of these could not be done nor is it necessary. The high gypsum content would permit drainage and facilitate irrigation for arable crops. Soil No.l has also the peculiarity in that the ignited soil on treatment with hydrochloric acid liberates hydrogen - sulphide. There is also a faint smell of this gas when the original soil is similarly treated with acid. But in the case of ignited soil the smell is more pronounced. This might be due to the soil formation itself. Soil No.3 is better than the other soils analysed and shows a good dispersion by Puri*s method even. It is expected that the moisture retaining power of this soil will be good enough. When soil No.l is said' to be under cultivation and large garden crops etc. are said to come up satisfactorily on it, in case of soil No.3 these crops must come up more luxuriantly. The soils 2 and 4a should behave like soil No.l in regard to such crops if cultivated and similarly manured. Because of the low rainfall and as the soils are not able to retain what little moisture they get r160 -3- •4* attempts should he made to bring about greater conservation of moisture in these soils by application of organic manures. Another important point is the removal of the soluble salts by proper irrigation and regulating the drainage system. Mechanical anal.vsis .- Because of the high content of gypsum, all soils except No.3, resist dispersion by any of the usual pre-treatments. Attempt to counteract the effect of this salt by sodium acetate solution and continuous washing has not met with the desired effect and the salt seems to be very tenacious. By the inability of the soils 4b, 5 and 6 to get dispersed it is presumed that these soils are also similar to 1, 2 or 4a. One thing is noticed in washing these soils to free them from calcium sulphate. It has been found that there is a tendency to get dispersed as the salt is being removed. The most serious effect of salts on crops will be to cause shortage of available water. The precautions to be taken in cultivating the soils are - (1) To ensure a good start for the seedling. This can be done by soaking seed for as long a period as is practicable before sowing and by an irrigation soon after sowing to wash down the accumulated salts. (2) To reduce evaporation from the soil to prevent excessive concentration of salts. This can be done by furrow irrigation, by mulching as soon as possible after every irrigation and by digging drains. (3) To increase the holding capacity of the soil for the irrigation water put on it. This can be done primarily by the application of organic matter and manures and by less frequent irrigation. If these precautions are taken in the cultivation and irrigation of these lands, it is highly probable that much of the land may be utilised for crop growing. t F.I.C.

This case was discusseu between tne Political Resident,the Adviser and the Political Agent and subsequently with His Excellency SnaiEh Hamad on the 2hth November 1933. 2. The Political Resident explained to ShaiEh Hamad that the matter was an internal one and one lor him morally to settle but that he thought the hibbas should include only the gardens and property of the four direct descendants of the late Shaikh Sir T isa and Shaikh Hamad’s son,Shaikh Salman^and that it should very definitely not include the property of other people whose gardens m^y be in the area of the originalhibDas. The Shaikh explained that his idea was that the open ground should revert to the Ruler but supposing one oi the owners of the hibba had two gardens a reasonable distance apart,that the open ground between the two gardens should be held to belong to the owner of the two tcardens. It was that two such gardens might be miles apart but the xax Shaikh said that it would be dealt with reasonably. 3* It was decided that the Shaikh would go into the matter and write to the Political Agent explaining what arrange™'^ 4 -' ^ — Letter received on the 8-4-1334 from Shaikh Hamaa bin f Is&lt;t P.A. 38-10-1338. P.A. Submitted.

There is a second danger that is including open land in the land to be inherited as this starts the whole 'hibba 1 question again. 3. There is also some danger in the exception of allowing the A1 Khalifah to 'sell any property out of which he does not get any income or benefit'. It may be noted that Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman is 2 4.one of those persons who usually tries to sell his land. Letter iN, o:C/138 of 20th March 1935 to Shaikh Sir Hamad.

I think that we must take the line that if he is to beincluded that it 5. This should be sent on tour with me A Dictated on 4-2-1935 P Fair draft submitted below. G.L.- 23/3/1935. We must ask the Shaikh to let us have our letter roper by. 9 I do not consider that Shaikh Khalifah binwould be better to drop this special arrangement. This can be sa id verbally and I do not think they w111 persue the matter. 3. Shaikh ^uhamTiad 1 s point about some latitude in the stipulation that if anyone is allowed to sell property he nust buy property of epual value is like splitting straws. Naturally this rule will have to be interpreted reasonably, but the spirit is to prevent^Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman from selling a large property and garden in return from for a small property. 4. It would be very dangerous to sign the documents that Shaikh Mihammad has got. If he brings them to be signed then no doubt the hibba question will come up for definite settlement. 5. I understand that Shaikh Salman was given considerable property by Shaikh T Isa during his life-time and, therefore, he wants his name among those whose sons will inherit property given to thetfather by Shaikh ^sa. I see no objection in this. It Is possible that we may be able to use giving him this privilege to bringing him in on our side over the question of giving any privilege to Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman, r\ Dicttated on 27-3-1935.

An f amarah was recently sold by one of the A1 Khalifah but was bought in by the Shaikh, otherwise I w r ill take action as proposed. 2. I also asked whether it would be advisable to write, now that there are funds coming in from oil royalties, that no ground should be sold without the Bahrain Government having an opportunity of taking it up. decided that this w 7 ould be unnecessary as the Bahrain Government would in any case have an opportunity of buying it if they wanted to do so and any orders of this sort would tend to encourage the Al Khalifah to try to sell their land in order that the Bahrain Government 26.1.1936.

In certain areas gypsum is found in the soil close to the surface. a limited quantity of manure is available from cows and camels and from old rubbish heaps in villages. During recent years the contents of cess pits have been used for manuring gardens by local Arabs. Vegetable manure is never used as all dry brush wood etc., is collected for fuel.
