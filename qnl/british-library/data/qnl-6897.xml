Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office. Special 8. t MEMORANDUM on BRITISH COMMITMENTS (DURING THE WAR) TO THE GULF CHIEFS. THE name ' Gulf Chiefs' is used to include a number of independent or autonomous Arab rulers—the Sultan of Maskat, the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, and the Sheikhs of Katar, Bahrein, Koweit, and Mohammerah—with whom His Majesty's Government have treaty relations, and who are dealt with by the Government of India through the British Resident in the Persian Gulf (Bushire) and the locaJ political agents under his authority. For our relations with the Gulf Chiefs before the war, it is sufficient to refer to the Foreign Office memorandum of the 12th February, 1908, respecting British interests in the Persian Gulf; to the appendices to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913 (in which we communicated to the Turkish Government all our agreements with the Gulf Chiefs, except the Secret Agreement of the 16th October, 1907); and to the draft of a despatch, dated August 1914, to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, reviewing the course of negotiations and agreements concluded in 1913 and 1914 regarding affairs of Turkey and the Persian Gulf. During the war certain fresh assurances and pledges have been given to the Gulf Chiefs, collectively and individually, by His Majesty's Government, and these are discussed below. (i.) Collective Assurances, In August 1914, after war had broken out between Great Britain and Germany, and Turkey had begun to display an intention of intervening on the German side, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf appears to have suggested to the Government of India that circular letters to the Gulf Chiefs ought to be drafted in advance, to be despatched the moment a state of war between Great Britain and Turkey came into existence. On the 6th September, 1914, the Government of India communicated to the Resident the text of a draft circular communique on the responsibility of Turkey for the outbreak of war, as well as suggestions for specific assurances to the more important of the Chiefs, which they were submitting to the India Office (61684/61439/14, No. 1). On the 14th September, 1914, the officiating Resident (64214/14, No. 1) submitted to the Government of India drafts of various notices, based on the drafts and sugges tions previously communicated to him, which he proposed to issue in the event of war occurring. These drafts contained both individual and collective assurances. The former will be dealt with separately later. The latter were embodied in the following passage of a ' Special Notice to be issued on the outbreak of war to the Arab rulers and sheikhs in the Persian Gulf and their subjects':— ' Your relations with Great Britain are of long standing, and I take the opportunity of assuring you that in this struggle we shall do our utmost to preserve for you your liberty and religion. No act of ours shall threaten either of these, which are dearer to humanity than life itself.' Under the same cover, the Resident submitted to the Government of India the draft of a circular proclamation regarding the Holy Places ;— ' From the High British Government. ' War has broken out between Great Britain and Turkey, but it is notified for the public information of all the Moslems that, so long as the Indian pilgrims proceeding to Mecca and Medina are not seriously interfered with, no hostile action will be taken by the British or Indian Government, or by their ships or soldiers, against the port of Jeddah or the Holy Places.' [972] BIn a telegram dated the 26th September. 1914 (64214/14, No. 12), the Government of India approved these two drafts, with the addition of a Holv Places ill Mesopotamia* And on the 6th October, 1914 (6(.896/14 ( JNo Z,), they informed the Resident that the issue of assurances, on the lines suggested 111 ^ previous telegram of the 6th September, 19] 4, had been approved provis.onally by B ' S ftfiooth these telegrams the Resident was instructed not to despatch any of ^ approved documents until final instructions to that eifeot were 8el ^ t0 R j . Accordingly, on the Ist November, 1914, when a state of war between Ureat and Turkey had already existed for two days, he telegraphed to the Government of India for permission (82713/14, p. 7). On the 2nd November, 1914, the &lt;.overn- ment informed him that permission was implied in certain previous telegrams of leirs (p. 8), and on receipt of this authorisation he appears immediately to have U'legraphe ^ instructions for the delivery of the messages to the local residents at the coin o i 10 various chiefs (p. 17). The assurances therefore bear date of the 3rd November, 1914. (ii.) Assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The Sheikh of Mohammerah's authority extends over the port oi Mohammerah (on the Karun River near its confluence with the Shatt-al-Arab), the navigable section of the Karun up to Ahwaz, and the Arab tribes in the neighbourhood ol the uver. He is nominally a Persian subject, but it is many years since the G-overnmen a Tehran has exercised effective authority over him, or indeed over the other nomina y Persian territories (Luristan, Bakhtiari-land, Kashgai-land, &amp;cr) that ^ border on ns dominions. The competent administration of the Sheikh in these dominions has been in marked contrast to the surrounding disorder. Commercial relations between Great Britain and Mohammerah are oi old s tan cling, and have given rise to political relations between His Majesty s Government and S iei Khazal since the beginning of the present century.f British interests at Mohammera were vastly increased by the concession accorded by the Persian (lovernment to Mr. W. K. d'Arcy in 1901, and taken up by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909. The oil-fields on which the Company concentrated its activities lay north -east ot t u- Karun, on the borders of Sheikh Khazal's country and Bakhtiari -land, ari&lt;l the natuial access from the sea was across Mohammerah territory. The Company made an agree ment with the Sheikh in 1909, and laid a pipe line from the fields to Mohammerah port. The fields proved so productive that by an agreement signed on the 20th May, 1914, His Majesty's Government acquired a predominant interest in the Company, and greatly increased the scale of its operations. Since that date His Majesty s Govern ment's relations with Mohammerah have been of direct importance for the supply of oil fuel to the British Navy. _ , oi -i i i i lj- In view of these closer relations, which began in 1909, the bheikh asked Hi^ Majesty's Government for more definite political assurances than they had previously given him (29456/24869/14). He was particularly anxious about a dynastic guarantee, and about the safeguarding of his position vis-d-vis the Persian Government and foreign Powers other than Great Britain. After due consideration ot his detailed proposals, his request was met by the following statement, which was communicated to him in writing on the 15th October, 1910, by Sir P. Cox, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, together with the insignia of a K .C .I .E. ;— ' I am authorised to inform your Excellency that, whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event ot an encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. ' In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such a Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia.' [In giving these two assurances, Colonel Cox was to add a verbal explanation to the effect that, while His Majesty's Government were perfectly sincere in their intentions towards the Sheikh, and had, therefore, given him these * ' After words ' Mecca aud Medina' in the Proclamation, add words ' or the Holy Places in Mesopotamia, and instead of 4 Holy Places,' say at the end 4 said Holy Places. f See Report, dated December 7th, 1913, by Sir P. Cox in 29456/24869/14.3 assurancos. yet cif cum stances might arise in which it would be impossible to ! ' v ' ; (( t 011 behalf. In such a case he would, of course, receive in S; longest diplomatic support. Colonel Cox was to record in writing the sul istance of the conversation, in the course of which this intimation 5 was made to the Sheikh.] ' hese assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your m.ile descendants, so Jong as you or they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the Central Government, and shall continue to be accept able to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Govern ment, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them.' A \ ersion of this statement was also handed to the Sheikh fat his express request) tor communication to his tribesmen. It differed from the other in the omission of the words 'to be acceptable to your tribesmen' from the lAst paragraph, and in the fact that it was not accompanied by the verbal explanation. On the 8th December, 1910, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired whether there was any truth in information which had reached him that the Sheikh was under British protection. The British Minister at Tehran replied that the Sheikh was not a British-protected person, but that His Majesty's Government had special relations with him, and would support him in the event of any encroachment on his rights. It was decided by the Foreign Office that no further information should be conveyed to the Persian Government regarding the Sheikh's relations with His Majesty's Government. On the 4th December, 1913, at a time when His Majesty's Government were contemplating the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Sheikh Khazal asked Sir P. Cox for still further assurances on the following lines (29456/14);— (1.) That we would make the position regarding the succession more secure by a modification of the wording of our assurances. (2.) That we would, now that peace had been made between the Bakhtiaris and himself, take cognisance of a definite compact of peace between them which would render him immune from the necessity and expense of collecting a large army annually each season for the protection of his territory against their aggression. (3.) That we should endeavour to devise and take measures with the Persian Government, and in such directions as may be politically possible, to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which the history of the past entitled him, and which he at present enjoys in practice, but on a precarious basis. In a report, dated the 7th December, 1913, to the Government of India Sir P. Cox conveyed these requests, and submitted that— 'we should meet the Sheikh's .wishes as far as we can in the matter of the wording of our assurance to him, and that instead of the words ' and be acceptable to your tribesmen,' we should substitute the words, ' and provided always that the nomination of your successor from among your descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of. His Majesty's Government.' tie proposed to meet Sheikh Khazal's other requests by negotiating on certain lines with the Russian and Persian Governments. The points raised in this report were still being discussed between the India Office and the Foreign Office when the outbreak of the war transformed the situation. Ihe disintegration of Persia and the encroachment of Russia, which had previously been the main preoccupation of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, w ere eclipsed by the more immediate menace from Turkey and Germany. The Sheikh of Mohammerah appears to have sent assurances of his loyalty to His Majesty's Government soon after a state of war between Great Britain and Germany was declared (61684/61439/14, No. 1), and it was clearly essential that we should reaffirm and strengthen our assurances to him. On the 6th September, 1914, the Government of India, in a telegram to the India Office repeated to the officiating Resident in the Gulf (61684/14, No. 1), made the following suggestion :— 'It is asserted by the Sheikh of Koweit, and there seem reasonable grounds to believe, that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in collusion with certain« notables of Basra with whom they are in close touch, and with the distant co-operation of Bin Saud, could (if given certain assurances) either prepare the way for our peaceful occupation of Basra, or, until we were in a position to take effective action, arrange to keep the place quiet and isolated. 'To the Sheikh of Mohammerah we should, give the assurance already sanctioned in connection with recent grant of decoration; undertaking to maintain him in secure and untaxed possession of his date gardens on the Turkish side of the river, and perhaps a promise to do our best vis-d-vis Persia to maintain him in his present state of local autonomy.' In accordance with this, the officiating Resident submitted to the Government of * India on the 14th September, 1914, the following draft of a special letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, together with drafts of other notices (discussed in section (1) above), to be despatched in the event of war between Great Britain and Turkey breaking out (64214/14: No. 1):— ' I am authorised by my Government to request your Excellency to co-operate with our honoured friends, their Excellencies the Amir of Nejd and the Sheikh of Koweit, in the capture of Basra from the Turks .... ' In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government to assure your Excellency that in the event of our success—and succeed we shall, insha Allah—Basra will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. ' I am further to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this writing, that, whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution m the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Central Government (provided always that the nomination of your successors from among your descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with and the approval of His Majesty's Government), and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. I is-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. ' Further, your date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession ot you and your heirs, and for ever immune from taxation.' This draft was approved by the Government of India on the 26th September, 1914 (64214/14, No. 12), with the substitution of the words ' date gardens which you now possess ior ' your date gardens 'in the last paragraph, and the omission of the words ' for ever.' In this emended form the letter was eventually delivered to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914. Later, after the occupationof Basra, Sheikh Khazal asked that the wording of the letter should be revised again. r ^ ese assurances, in the form originally sanctioned by Government, con tained a reference to the co-operation expected from the Sheikh in the event of its being needed in connection with the capture of Basra. The Sheikh urged that as occasion did not arise for the fulfilment of this obligation, it seemed somewhat mconvenient and superfluous for it to be mentioned in a communication which would become an important permanent record; he therefore begged for a revised letter trom which the passages relating to Basra should be omitted.'* o'u ^i 0 k' r^f ter 0 ^ a ^ n g the approval of the Viceroy, sent the on 3 ^ OCUment t0 She . lk i 1 l Kha2a1 ' datill g ^ 22rd November, 1914, being the date on which Basra was occupied by the British forces dated thi^+h^On^T ^ ^®^® 8urance8 conveyed to your Excellency in my letter further valued rptV ^ i 1 Shawwal, 1328), and having regard to the lurther valued services and co-operation which your Excellency has rendered to • Utter, dated Baara, 1st April, 1915, from Sir P. Cox to Government of India, in 62555/15. )the British Government and British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arah, I am now authorised to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessar7 for obtaining a satisfactory solution, both to yourself and to us, in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government, pro vided always that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty's Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. ' Vis-d-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. ' Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs, and immune from taxation. 'P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul- General for Fars, dec.' Towards the end of the year 1915, when it appeared probable for a time that Persia would intervene in the war on the side of the enemy, there was some discussion on the question of recognising Sheikh Khazal's independence in this event, and a line of procedure was sketched out by Sir P. Cox in telegrams dated the 1st November, 1915 (163390/161734/15), and the 14th November, 1915 (171916/161734/15). But since the contin^encv never, in fact, occurred, the assurance of the 22nd ISovemher, 1914, has remained the final embodiment, up to the present date, of His Majesty s Government s commitments to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (hi) Assurances to the Sheikh of Koweit. Koweit became of vital interest to Great Britain when it was proposed to prolong the Bagdad Railway, as a German concern, to a deep-water port on the Persian Gulf. Before 'he outbreak of the war, His Majesty's Government's relations with the Sheikh of Koweit were based upon the secret agreements concluded with him in 1899 and 1907, and the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913. By the terms of the latter the Sheikh was recognised as Kaimakam of an autonomous kaza ot the Ottoman Empire ; the boundaries of his immediate territory and his wider tribal jurisdiction were delimited ; the Ottoman Government recognised existing agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government; and His Majesty's Government undertook, on their part, not to alter the nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit, 01 to establish a protectorate there, so long as the status quo, as defined m the Convention, underwent no change. j m • n u u On the 8th August, 1914, Sheikh Mubarak was informed ofhcially by the officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Germany (G1684/61439/14, No. 12). On the 21st August, 1914 m an interview with the British Resident at Koweit, he made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty's Government on behalf of himsell and his tribes, placed his efforts, his men, and his ships' at Great Britain's disposal, and expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrisons from the islands at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, vvInch he claimed as lawfully his. He repeated this declaration in a letter ol the same date, to the officiating' Resident in the Gulf, which was formally acknowledged by the latter on the 25th August, 1914. u • . • 4.1 In view of the increasing likelihood that Turkey would interveno m the war on Germany's side, it became clear that His Majesty's Government s previous uudertakings to the Slieikh of Koweit would have to be renewed, and contingently extended, against the event of a state of war arising between Great Britain and iurkey. ^ [972 j 0On the 6th September. 1914, the Government of India, in a telegram referred to already in section (ii), made the following suggestion (61684/14, No. 1) :— ' It is asserted by the Sheikh of Koweit, and there seem reasonable grounds to believe, that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in collusion with certain notables of Basra, with whom they are in close touch, and with the distant co-operation of Bin Saud, could (if given certain aHSurances) either prepare the way for our peaceful occupation of Basra, or, until we are in a position to take effective action, arrange to keep the place quiet and isolated. ' To secure these results I would offer the following inducements, in addition to the assurance that Basra would never again be subjected to Turkish authority. ' To the Sheikh of Koweit, we should offer full possession and immunity from taxation for his date gardens on the Turkish bank between Fao and Gurnah ; immunity from the consequences of ejecting the present small Turkish military posts from Safwan, Umm Kasr, and Bubiyan ; and thereafter recognition under British protection of independent principality of Koweit.' * On the 14th September, 1914, the officiating Resident in the Gulf submitted to the Government of India a draft of a special letter to the Sheikh of Koweit, together with other drafts referred to above in sections (i) and (ii) (64214/14, No. 1) :— ' In return for the valuable co-operation which we expect from you, I am authorised by the Government in the event of success—and, insha Allah, we shall succeed—to assure 3 T ou that Basra will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. ' I am further to give your Excellency personally the following special assurances :— '(1.) Your date gardens between Fao and Gurnah shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and for ever be immune from taxation. ' (2.) You are guaranteed by the great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr, and Bubiyan. ' (3.) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' This draft, like the others, was approved by the Government of India on the 26th September, ]'J 14 (64214/14, No. 12), with the same alterations in assurance (1), regarding the Sheikh's date gardens in the Basra vilayet, as were made in the corresponding passage in the draft special letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. ^^The letter, in its emended form, was eventually despatched on the 3rd November, On the 28th February, 1917, upon the death of Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Subah, these undertakings were renewed in the 'Kharita' to his son; and after the latter had also died and had been succeeded by his brother. Sheikh Salim-bin-Mubarak, the Government of India forwarded to Sir P. Cox, for presentation to the new ruler, a ' Kharita from the Viceroy renewing to him likewise the undertakings which His Majesty's Government had made to his father (68308/34912/17). u- ur at * •^ ie ^ rs ^ la ^ the year 1918 Sheikh Salim created considerable difficulties tor His Majesty s Government over the question of the control of the blockade in Koweit territories and ports. And, in this connection, the following message was conveyed to him through the Resident at Koweit on the 5th July,' 1918 (121490/ 4J888/18) ;— Government have deeply regretted the events of the last two years at owei t but they welcome your declarationf as affording an opportunity for re-establishment of our traditional friendship. In order that there may be no — ei standing in the future, they desire to explain their policy towards your On the one hand, should you show to Government same friendship and assis ance w ic they have experienced for many years in their dealings with the ni eis o o. eit, they will continue to you the assurances given to your illustrious a er, je ate Sheikh Mubarak, especially that 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and to 11S ' j UrS a f 1 - 1 11T^ ^ a ex tend to you the friendship and protection and ance w uc ] t iey gave to him ; and, finally, they hope that you will raise as we are in*a 1 uositioirtcrnrntlTt W f &lt;; f ?, ^ 10u1 n °t ^ 0 ' st flag- at Koweit as soon after declaration of war as we are in a position to protect it from Turkish attack.—P.

Government will be compelled to hold your Excellency personally responsible should any such act unfortunately be committed in future. 1 hey hope your Excellency will fully realise vour i esponsibility as the ruler of Koweit towards Government under whose protection and friendship Koweit has so greatly prospered in the past, and will understand that prosperity depends entirely on preservation of true friendship, both in word and deed, with Government.' Ibis appears to be the most recent statement made on the part of His Majesty's Government with regard to their relations with Koweit. (iv.) Treaty with the Sheikh of al-Katar. Under the Anglo-lurkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, the Turks renounced all their pretensions in the Peninsula of al-Katar, which lay east of the line laid down in the Convention as the eastern boundary of the ' Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd.' 1 his Cleared up the situation in the al-Katar country, which had been obscure since the establishment of a Turkish military post there in 1872, and on the 15th July, 1914, the India Office telegraphed to the Viceroy (33406/1990/14) suggesting that the time was approaching when a treaty should be concluded with the new Sheikh 1 * (i.e., Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani), and asking for definite proposals as soon as possible. On the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, Sheikh Abdullah- bin-Jasim was informed thereof officially by the officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf (66597/1990/14), and returned a satisfactory reply. But in a despatch to the Government of India, dated the 1st September, 19 1 4, the officiating Resident drew attention to the fact that Sheikh Abdullah was not effective ruler of the country, and submitted that, while it was in His Majesty's Government's interest to assist him to become so, the immediate conclusion of a treaty would be premature. It does not appear whether this despatch reached the Government of India before they drafted the telegram of suggestions, dated the 6th September, 1914(61684/61439/14), which has been referred to several times above, and in which the question of al-Katar was discussed as follows ;— ' As regards the Sheikh of Katar, it is probable that he could not and would not evict the Turkish garrison without active support from us, but their ejection in the event of war would be a simple matter, and if the Sheikh were first informed, and given an assurance that his position and privileges as ruling Sheikh of Katar would be thereafter recognised and maintained by us, we should doubtless have his co-operation in effecting their bloodless expulsion.' No special letter to Sheikh Abdullah was included among the drafts submitted by the officiating Resident in the Gulf on the 14th September, 1914, presumably for the reasons advanced in his despatch of the 1st September, 1914, and in a telegram dated the 6th October, 1914, to the Government of India (69321/61439/14, No. 3), he dealt with the point as follows :— ' Assurance to Sheikh of Katar is the only point about which I am doubtful. , Hitherto I have regarded Sheikh of Katar as a factor to be neglected when interests of far greater importance are pressing, and my proposal was merely to furnish usual notification, which has been issued toother Gulf chiefs, to Sheikh Abdullah. Katar sheikhs, in view of their present internal quarrels, are quite unable to turn out existing Turkish garrison, which is quite isolated and innocuous. Kindly instruct me accordingly if you consider that anything further is required. ' In absence of specific instructions it is clearly understood that I take no action.' v The officiating Resident's view appears to have been adopted by the Government of India, and no special commitments were entered into tow T ards the Sheikh of Katar * In 1868 a fairly loose agreement on trucial lines had been concluded with the then Sheikh, but His Majesty's Government had refused to renew it during the Turkish occupation of the post of al-Bidaa.on the occasion of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and i nrkey. In the course of the year 1915, however the question of p^eul Abdullah was discussed between the Government of India and k. . ( Resident in the Gulf and Chief Political Officer at Basra), and in September 1. lo a drSt treaty was ready for presentation to the Sheikh. The terms of this draft may be Bummanaed ^® e ^ ence to the treaty coao l uc l e d w ith Sheikh Abdullah's predecessor in 1868 • Sheikh Abdullah to undertake to co-operate with His Majesty s Government in the suppression of the slave-trade, piracy and the arms traffic in the^meina''.eras the Trucial Chiefs, and to 'abide by the spirit and obligations of the tieaties and encragements ' existing between them and His Majesty s Government. ° Art 2 His Majesty's Government to accord to Sheikh Abdullah the same advantages as to the Trucial Chiefs. Copies of all the Trucial Treaties to be signed by Sheikh Abdullah and the British representative. Art 3 Sheikh Abdullah to publish a proclamation forbidding the arms trathc in his ports and territories. His Majesty's Government, on their part, to furnish him with a fixed quantity of arms per annum for public use, and with a subsidy of rupees , per I] ^ 1 t se ™- Sheikh Abdullah to receive and protect British traders and, if His Majesty's Government so desire, a British agent. . . , au *1 u Art. 5. Duties levied on British goods not to exceed those levied on bheikh Abdullah's own subjects or 5 per cent, ad valorem, and no other dues to be imposed on British goods or British subjects. ^ -.i ^ Art. 6. Sheikh Abdullah not to have relations with any other 1 ower without the consent of His Majesty's Government,and not to lease or alienate territory to any oilier Power or its subjects. . • , . - t- xj - Art. 7. Sheikh Abdullah not to grant concessions without the consent ot His Majesty's Government. ^ ^ j ^ t u Art. 8. Sheikh Abdullah to accept and protect a British post-othce and telegraph installation in his territory. * i j n i u- Art. 9. His Majesty's Government to undertake to protect Sheikh Anaullali, his subjects and his territory from aggression by sea. Art. 10. ' His Majesty's Government also to undertake to grant Sheikh Abdullah good offices, should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Katar. But that it shall be thoroughly understood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or (of?) aggression on the part of Sheikh Abdullah or his subjects agaiust others.' A draft proclamation in Sheikh Abdullah's name, prohibiting the arms traffic, was prepared at the same time. On the 16th September, 1915 (116749/107294/16), copies of these drafts were communicated by Sir P. Cox to the Political Agent at Koweit, with instiucti(^ns to proceed to Katar and negotiate a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah on this basis. Sir P. Cox noted that articles 3, 4, 6 and 7 were essential, but that concessions might be made regarding articles 5 and 8. On the 21st and 22nd, October, 1915, the Political Agent at Koweit, accompanied by the Political Agent at Bahrein, discussed exhaustively with Sheikh Abdullah the two drafts, and also the treaties with the Trucial Chiefs, to the terms of which Sheikh Abdullah was to subscribe under article 1. Finally the Sheikh consented to everything except articles 4 (reception of British traders and agent), 5 (guarantees for British trade) and 8 (British post-office and telegraph installation) of the draft treaty, and article 6 of the general treaty of 1820 with the Gulf Chiefs, under which-each party accorded the other the right to accredit a representative.* In regard to these articles Sheikh Abdullah sent the following verbal message to His Majesty's Government:— ' Please tell them that I will gladly undertake everything else that you have put to me, and that I am very sorry indeed not to be able to accept British or any other foreign subjects as permanent residents in my country at present. 1 would welcome them gladly myself, but my people are not yet sufficiently civilised, nor is my rule sufficiently consolidated, and I am afraid of serious trouble, which could only end in my own destruction, if I allowed foreigners in now. You may add, however, that this is only a temporary difficulty which I hope a few years will remove, and I promise, if Government will allow clauses IV, V, and VIII to stand over for the .

As long as our right in each o t lese respects is clearly enunciated, I think we can afford to reserve them for le present or t le reason that, if trade and harbour facilities progress at Bahrein, a^ ey are oing, the trade tor the greater part of the Katar peninsula will depend upon Bahrein, when we shall have practical control over it. . ^ ^ r ticle 6 ot the general treaty, I am of opinion that it would be est tor bheikh Abdullah to sign the treaty as a whole, but with the reservation above the signature in regard to the above article that he does not subscribe to article 6. /^.^ e /7! Cer0 ^ m a te ^ e g ram to the India Office dated the 2nd June, 1916 (107294/16). suggested that Sheikh Abdullah's objections should be acceded to if necessary:— Articles to which Sheikh takes exception are of no great importance at present tnne, and by accepting remaining articles Sheikh undertakes to do practically all that we immediately require. We therefore propose to authorise Cox to negotiate treaty on lines acceptable to Sheikh, should he find any difficulty m securing Sheikh s acceptance of articles to which he now objects. We consider it more important to secure a reasonably satisfactory treaty than run the risk of a breakdown of negotiations by insisting on conclusion of a treaty on all fours with other trucial treaties. Kindly telegraph your approval.' This suggestion was approved by the India Office (125270/16), with the con currence of the Foreign Office (120978/16), in a telegram dated the 27th June, 1916. Accordmgly the Government of India telegraphed to Sir P. Cox on the 29th June, 1 16 (164214/16), that he should resume negotiations with Sheikh Abdullah on the suggested lines, with the special instruction that article 3 of the draft, providing for the importation of arms, should be framed more strictly. Sir P. Cox proceeded in due course to Katar and carried the negotiations to a a^ UC | l k S1 V le treaty, as it was eventually signed by him and oheikh Abdullah at A1 Bidaa on the 3rd November, 1916, is printed in Appendix A to [972] j)10 the present memorandum. In this text article 3 of the original draft relating to the arms traffic/was made more stringent, while, as a concession to bheikb Abdullah, article 6 was altered so as to apply to British merchandise only and not to British traders. Articles 7, 8, and 9 (corresponding respectively to articles 4 and 8 ot the draft), were left as they stood, but .in a letter from Sir P. Cox to Sheikh Abdullah (Appendix B), of the same date as the treaty, it was agreed, m the name ot His Majesty s Government, that they should remain in suspense for an unspecified period. It wan also agreed that, notwithstanding article 9 of the treaty ot 1820 with the I rucial Chiefs, to which he had now subscribed. Sheikh Abdullah and his subjects should be allowed^ to retain negro slaves already in their possession, on condition of their treatment being satisfactory. In pursuance of article 3, Sheikh Abdullah signed the draft proclamation reffardine: the arms traffic (Appendix C), and issued it, on the same date, in Ins o\\ n name. On the 4th November, 1916, Sir P. Cox forwarded to the Government of India the texts of the treaty as signed, of his own letter to sheikh Abdullah, aiM &lt;&gt;1 bheikh Abdullah's proclamation, together with a full report on the negotiations. In a telegram to the India Office, dated the 10th January, 1917, the Viceroy proposed that the treaty should be ratified (25485/15720/17), and the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office (25485/17), signified its approval in a telegram dated the 13th February, 1917 (35527/17). The signed copy of the treaty was accordingly returned to Sir P. Cox by the India Office with three parchment copies of the English version, and he was instructed to have the Arabic version reproduced on the margins of these copies, to sign them himself, and to obtain the signature of Sheikh Abdullah. Ihese instructions appear to have been duly carried out, and the treaty was ratified on the 23rd March, 1918, by the Government of India. Relation of CommitTnents {during the War} to the Gulf Chiefs to British Desiderata* There would appear to be no serious conflict between the two. The general collective assurance merely reaffirms, in the vaguest terms, our previous undertakings to the various chiefs. The general assurance regarding British policy towards the Holy Places, including those in Mesopotamia, is in no way at variance with British interests or with commit ments entered into on the same subject with other parties by His Majesty's Government. The assurance, given to the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit, that ' Basra should never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority,' is practically identical with the assurances subsequently given to the notables of Basra Vilayet by Sir P. Cox, and again by the Viceroy of India in a speech delivered at Basra on the 3rd February, 1915. It is also consistent with our pledge to King Husein that Basra shall be included within the boundaries of Arab independence, while, unlike the latter pledge, it leaves His Majesty's Government a completely free hand in regard to the positive disposal of Basra, so long as a restoration of Turkish sovereignty is excluded. The special assurance to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, of which the final text is contained in Sir P. Cox's communication dated the 22nd November, 1914, is for the most part a repetition, practically word for word, of the assurance of 1910, with the impor tant exception that, in the dynastic guarantee, the stipulation that the Sheikh's successors must be acceptable to the tribesmen as well as to His Majesty 's Government is omitted. There are also two short additional clauses, and the first of these makes our under taking to support the Sheikh's established rights vis-dois the Persian Government more definite, and introduces the word ' autonomy.' In effect it would make it morally incumbent upon His Majesty's Government to interfere in case the Sheikh's rights were violated by Tehran; but no doubt we should in any case take action, in such circum stances, in our own interests, and the assurance does not commit us to take specific action, or to carry our action further than we may think desirable at the time. The most important point is that none of our commitments to the Sheikh of Mohammerah are inconsistent with a loyal recognition of Persia's integrity. The second additional clause, regarding the Sheikh's date gardens in what was formerly lurkish territory, is a comparatively trifling matter; and since the immunity from taxation is not specifically accorded in perpetuity, it could presumably be modified if it became a grave embarrassment to Basra finances. The special assurance to the Sheikh of Koweit leaves the previous relations between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government unaffected, and merely commits us to the abolition of lurkish suzerainty over him. This suzerainty was, of course, &gt; objectionable from the British point of view, and was in effect an anomaly, since our11 agreements with the Sheikh, which were recognised by the Turkish Government in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, had placed him, with the exception of this Turkish suzerainty, in a 'trucial' relationship to His Majesty's Government. From the trucial point of view, the existing agreements appear satis- lactory. But if it is desired to modify or amplify them at some future date, this can now be done without reference to Turkey. On this head, therefore, the assurance to the Sheikh of Koweit is at least as much in our interest as in his. As regards Safwan, Umm Kasr, and Bubiyan, the guarantee against Turkish reprisals for an attack on the Turkish military posts there on the part of the Sheikh has, of course, been .fully redeemed, and is now an obsolete question. The important point is the permanent political ownership of the places referred to. Bubiyan is an island at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and Safwan and Umm Kasr are forts on the mainland just north of it. All three had been in dispute for many years before the war between the Sheikh of Koweit and Turkey. The Anglo- lurkish Convention of the 2Dth July, 1913, effected a compromise, assigning Bubiyan Island to the direct territories of the Sheikh, while Safwan and Umm Kasr forts were excluded even from his outer sphere of tribal allegiance, and were assigned to the Turkish vilayet of Basra. Our assurance practically commits us to recognising Sheikh Salim's sovereignty over Safwan and Umm Kasr, as well as Bubiyan. But since the Sheikh is in a trucial relationship with us, our position at Basra would in no way be injured by this, nor does the possession of these forts by the Sheikh appear to conflict with any other British interest. The assurance regarding the Sheikh's date gardens is on the same footing as that given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. As regards the treaty with the Sheikh of al-Katar, the only point on which it goes beyond the normal type of ' trucial treaty ' is the undertaking, under article 11, that His Majesty's Government's good offices shall be used on the Sheikh's behalf in the event of unprovoked aggression against him hy land. But the assurance is so vague and guarded that it hardly constitutes a serious innovation. [972] E12 APPENDIX A.

XL They also undertake to grant me good offices, should I or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar. It is, however, thoroughly understood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part of myself or my subjects against others.
