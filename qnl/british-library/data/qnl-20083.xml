The report, written in somewhat light hearted vein, is of considerable interest, and undoubtedly His Highness' personal visit to this part of his domains will be productive of good results# 3* There is little doubt that did finance but permit the subsidising of enterprising cultivators the narrow belts of rich cultivation, which extended along the coastal region, could be still further broadened by the sinking of deep wells inland* 4 0 The consujhation of this eutopian ideal is howevor too far beyond the realm of possibility to make its discussion, under existing circumstances, worthy of closer examination* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Subject:•His Highness 1 s tour of the Betineh coast. During the last two ye^rs a tour of his dominions by the Sultan has 'been becoming increasingly necessary. y the ^ul 2. In a State like this,where the ruler has absolute power in Government,it is c^rtrin that a large number of points will always arise which can only be settled by the ruler himself Pa inconvenient number of these,mostly concerned with revenue matters.having accumulated,His Highness decided to carry out a comprehensive tour of the Betineh coast, as far as Sahar. V:- *, Accordingly,at dawn on the ?nd of February,immedi- -ctely after Famadhan,His Highness accompanied by three members of the ruling family,Sheikh Isa the Chief Qezi,the Iv 'udir Ismail, a dandified young gentlemen from Palestine who was formerly Head Master of the Local School and now acts as tutor to Sayid Fahr, Sa T ud,ex-W8li of Dhofrr,now appointed to Sah^r and a number of influential Sheikhs from the Bctineh and their escorts started off for Sib the first settlement on th^ Batineh coast after leaving I'uscat^Kis Highness T s psrty or Shoma was composed entirely of camels and,although only numbering about e hundred at this stage of the journey,it presented an increasingly imposing apuearance as it was augmented in numbers from day to dry,by the constant arrival of new Shoikhs and their parties v 4, \ The rest of us,including myself,little Sayid Fahr His Highness f s youngest brother aged about c years end Doctor Mardi the stout and cheerful /ssistant Surgeon,lent to us by kind fevour of the Political &gt;gent ,proceided in my c'ar^this being,as His Highness jocularly remarked,a mode of progression more suited to our staid and respectable personalities.

These unfortunates had a very strenous time as,in addition to being constantly raked fore and aft by the long thorns of Ghaf trees overhanging the road, they w«re expected also to push the lorry through the frequent patches of he*»vy sand as well as assist in mending punctures^e^tc• 5 • Next to Sabar,Sib is th' 3 pleasantest place on the Tat ineh coast. The reason being that cultivation is not entirely for comirercial purposes, A lsr t »e number of private gardens exist belonging to merchrnts and others in Kusoat nni Muttroh. These gardens present a pleasing appearance by reason of the more or less haphazard arrangement of date palms,mangoes,limes,guavas, bananas,etc# In summer,as Tv^r. Bertram Thomas has written,Sib acts as the Brighton of liusc^t and every one who can or cennot afford to do so goes down there during the hot weather to enjoy the cool sea breazes and rest in the shade of the trees. ^• Leaving Sib one plunges almost immediately into an area of intensive date cultivation, ^xcert for a few shade trees such as mangoes and a broad leaved tree known locally as the 'Bidam', usually to be found growing in the immediate vicinity of wells,nothing else is to be seen except row upon row of date trees. 7. Villages are met with every few miles along the coast. Some consist only of o few scattered date stick huts while others extend continuously along the shore for a distence of a mile or more. Euined mud forts or towers usually dominate -mf sottl^cr^nts,e riminisc^ncs of the power of Sheikhs in ■^orr^r tiirie?, VillPges of ^ iror^ permanent net^ire composed of irnc' or stono houses sre Plso to be found rt souewhct greeter int^rvFlr on the Irndwerd side of the date belt which evereges perheps helf c mile in width. £.

The hearty laughter necessary for the rror^r digestion of these delicrcies wrs urovided by the presence at the end of the table of the Court Jester whose indignant pro tests and recriminations at the indignities inflicted upon him by the nubian slaves and his imnediate neighbour added further z^st to the horseplay and agreeably enlivened the assembly.^ Occasionally # as a mark of great favour,Kis Highness would be ■ole^sed to select e bare and gnawed bone for presentation to him, when the poor man 's vigorous repudiation of such unseemly gifts . and erkprtations to the Sultan to remember his position and dignity would arouse the assembly to even greater heights of merriment. Kis Highness was met end accompanied by all the important Sheikhs owing allegiance to Muset f and at Saher the Sheikh of Baraimi also appeared. 14, The efjects of this tour upon the Batineh as a whole hrve been e-xcellent and, but for this, it would have been difficult to carry on the administration during His Kighness 's projected long absence at Dhofer.V^ 15.

They reported serious situation hsving arisen through recalcitrant attitude of following Sheikhs who have absolutely refused pay revenues or to come in:- Abdullah Mohammad bin Hamuda Abdullah bin Saif Abdullah bin Mohammad el Saadi Abdullah bin Matar el Breki Moh^mmod bin Saif el Salami A Nasir bin Said el Khalidi Saif bin Mohammad el Khalidi These men live in villages on coast line between Marair and iQiaburah sa and have nearly all refused summons to 5. Zakat due from Sohar area is 60,000 dollars of which only 16,000 have been collected. 6* Saiyid Hamad fears that their example will have widespread effect throughout JBatinah if immediate strong action i« not taken. This they (Muscat) are incapable of taking themselves and seek our aid in form of sloop, whose appearance off offending villages Saiyid Hamad thinks may have salutary effect, if conjoint warning is issued to refractory Sheikhs. 7. The report needs careful sifting v/hich I am ar ranging to do to-day through my own agencies whilst selfand Sloan are proceeding Shinas to reconnoitre and, if possible, mark out aerodome.This in itself and our opportune arrival in this area may have quieting effect but if the report is confirmed it is obvious thct only firm action v/ill restore situation 'which abounds with cdverse possibilities. 8- Saiyad Hamad accompanies us to-dcjy.

Beference my Express Xetter No.G/208 dated 5th November 1933. 1 returned to Sohar late on the night of 5/6th instant having completed the marking out of the Shinas landing ground with Plying Officer oloan. arrangements have been mpde for the marks to be made durable for per manent use and the landing ground cleared and levelled, i.iis work in already in hand and it ir hoped that the area will be ready for use in 15-20 dayso Th - e flying boat expected from Muscat arrived dt iu.00 lirs and created a visible impression on the local inhabitants who crowded to the foreshore to view it closely. 2 * At my request the flying boat on its return journey circled over one of the more recalcitrant areas ten miles south of Sohar. 4 ' This, coupled with the facts that Saiyid Hamad has been seen accompanying the 'British Consul' to Chinas, that an 'aerodroII]e ,, was marked out and that Shinas was visited uy a flying boat the same day, has had, in my opinion, a mo^t desirable effect. The flying boat ! s visit was further enhanced by the fact that a member of the -.-ascat Council and another member from the Ruling family, were incidentally, and at my request, on board. &lt;-&gt;• During my absence from Sohar the Consular -ragoraan had been engaged in nrking quiet enquiries fromvarious sources as t o the amount of revenue tha u iiaa actually 'been collected. As a result of these enquiries it transpires that at any rate 20,000 dollars, if not more, have been collected. It remains to he seen if this amount is credited into the Treasury. rj ^ It is significant to note that whereas previously R.S.Duli Chand had told me distinctly that only ^ 16,000 zakat had been collected, on my return journey through ifliaburah he informed me that the amount was / ^0,000. 3 o Although a number of Sheikhs have undoubtedly refused to pay their zakat, the possibility hps to be considered of thi 43 fact being used to account for any short payments into the Treasury by the two individuals, Saiyid Hamid and Rai Sahib Duli Ghand, now engaged on tax gathering. Whilst at present there is nothing tangible to establish such a suspicion, the necessary ingredients are all present and the character of the two tax gatherer^ i^ not such as to pl«ce them beyond that suspicion. Although Saiyid Hamid has submitted a written report to the Council I have not so iar received from them any request for advice or assistance. I learn un officially that they are divided in^j/ their opiniorib, which on the whole tend to a policy of laisser-iaire. 10, Taking all things into consideration I am of the opinion that any threat or demonstration at the pre sent juncture would not only be unsuitable but unsuccess ful in obtaining the desired results® it would however be of immense value in view ox possible eventualities to have the strip of coast between Sohar and Khaburah photographed from the air in a con nected mosaic and I would strongly advocate that this be done at the earliest opportunity. Such a map, collated with ground inforraRtion, would permit of swift action should the situation later demand drastic measures.I am of tii'? opinion thf t the present revenue system leaves much to be desired and needs complete revision at a very early date by a competent and qualified British Officer. It appears to leave many unnecessary loop hojes for peculation and whilst the poor pay, the strong refuse payment with impunity, to the ve^y very great detriment of the State, 1 .

Prom, v: 'I't llfojor C.E.IT.Bremner, M.C.» nW-, Political Agent &amp; H.B.Hl's Consul, Muscat. To, The Hon''ble the Political Resident in the xcrcictn Gulf, I have the honour to submit for your information a brief report on the conditions at present prevailing on the Batinah coast as observed by Hirza Ismail Barduli who was recently deputed by me to tour this area in connection with the alleged traffic in arms. 2* Whilst Mirza Ismail was hdspitably received by the various Walis throughout his tour, this fact in itself militated against him obtaining more extensive information as local inhabitants, merchants, etc., being afraid of being involved with the Walis, were loathe to be seen talking with a representative of the Agency* None the less Mirza Ismail contrived to quietly see numerous persons and to glean the information contained in his report. 2&gt;• The situation, whilst not alarming, is anything but satisfactory, but in view of the circumstances under which my deputy visited the Batinah, i.e. with facilities afforded by the State, I have not thought fit to brooch the matter to the Sultan's representative Saiyid ^hahab, 4. As has already been pointed out in the penultiuic 'tc paragraph of my Express Letter No.C/209 of 7th November the majority of the revenue extracted from the Batinah is wrung from the weak, whilst the powerful pay nothing Sir, Bushire.nrnmrr^l 2. or Just whatever they wish to pay. It would seein to be merely a matter of time before the present policy of exactions will driTC those that do pay^ revenue to cut their losses and emigrate elsewhere. I hove the honour to 'be. Sir, iour most obedient servant* Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat.Report on the condition of the Botxnah. *4 Throughout the length and brecdth of the cooetol area great discontent prevails over the revenue system and the Banner in which it is collected hy R.S. Dull Chand. Not only has the revenue been increaeed hut new taxes are always being invented and imposed by him. presumably with His Highness's approYol. 2. only those people pay who are unable to resist and the more pwerful people pay nothing at all. To such an extent is this the practice that many tax payers have resolved to abandon their property and to go elsewhere as they are being ruined by staying on under present c ircumstonces• 3 . it is an universal complaint that no one in authority will hear the grievances of the people. If they complain to Bull Chand he merely abuses them filthily and if they complain to His iHghness their statements are misrepresented by Dull Chand. who is misleading the Sultan. If he was not a British subject Dull Chand would te murdered but the people are afraid to kill him because of the British Government. 4. Smuggling goes on quite openly all up the coast as it is impossible for the Customs clerks, with the assistance of one or two Askarls to prevent it. Often if they attempt to question the owner of a sailing craft as to what he has to declare, they are told to mind their own business and to make themselves scarce. The #*stome clerks are powerless to resist. 5. in the same most of the Walls have no power or influence at all unless it be entirely due to their personality. They have to keep in with both sides - i.e. placate Hie Highness and to keep in with the local people. Thus offences are rarely punished. Justice isseldom done and many prohibited practices are carried on with the knowledge of the Wall* 6. The following gives detail by WelayatBi- Ahu Baqorah* The Sultan attempted five months ago to instal a jfaxb Wali at Abu Baqarah (North of Shinas and South of Muratr) but the local Sheikhs objected and this official had to go back. The Sultan has no ilifluc-nce in this area* shines* I was told here that the -^ani Ojxtob and other tribes of the interior are continually raiding Shinae and carrying off cattle and sheep, etc. A Baluchi boy was kidnapped a month ago and nothing has been heard of him again. The local people are all terrified at a rumour that the Bani qatab intend to attack Shinaa in force. Smuggling ie rife here and cannot be prevented. Caravans come direct from ^ebai with merchandise and &gt; pay nothing# Schar« Sohar Welayat is better than all the others. This is chiefly due to the tactful administration of Saiyid Sou&lt;S bm Ali, the Wali who is shrewd and able. He is at present with the Sulten in India* The Naih Wali here, Mohamad 'bin Sulaiman bin Khomis is of al Saidi family* He is quite useless and inefficient. o It is kaid he used to be/gardener. Saham&gt; The state of Saham, due to overwhelming taxes and Zakat is not good and people ore very discontented. The Wall ie ^oiyid Soif bin Bader, who was at one time in Sur. ( Note&gt; This individual distinguished himself for his incompetence and cowardice in Sur)* Khoburah. Khoburah is very badly off. Owing to the way3. r) b rfy Khoburoh has t)een 'bled many people contemplate selling their property^ if possible, and emigrating* Very high rates have been imposed on dates, ] lines, etc* by Jul! Chandi As a consequence the Arabs of Dhahirah have ceoscd dealing with Khaburah merchants and have diverted their trade to Bebai. Some I&gt;ebai merchants have recently opened shop in Ibri (Oman). The Bedouin realises that ^ebai is thus more accessible to him now and in future trade will be diverted there. Muscat State and merchants of Khaburah will thus both suffer Ikeavily. Owing to the cleapness of dates and heavy Zakat assessment on their gardens many owners propose abandoning their gardens and emigrating. absoluely The Wali, Hamad bin Hilal al Sammar, is/helpless and has no authority over the ^heikhs in his area.
