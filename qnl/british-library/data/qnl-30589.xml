Political Agent at Enclosure No. 1. Extract from Maskat News No. 1115, for the week ending 15th November 1913. {Received 20th November 1913.) 510. With reference to diary entry No. 499, it is said that Shaikh Isa bin Salih al-Harithi has returned an adverse reply saying that he will soon come down to Khoz and then see what can be done with regard to an understanding with His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, who he suggests might meet him at or near Khoz. 511. It is rumoured that a large rabble, said to be 15 to 20 thousand com posed of all the Ghafiri tribes of Oman, has freshly assembled at Samail at the bidding of the Imam and As-Salami, who, it is further stated, are going to attack Maskat shortly. But there is absence of any reliable news from the interior this week. 512. With reference to diary entry No. 500, Shaikh Ali bin Muhammad bin Salim Al-Qarawi left for his home in Murbat. Enclosure No. 2. Extract from Maskat News No. 1149, for the week ending 29th November 1913. {Received 3rd December 1913.) 539. With reference to diary entry No. 524, 100 of the Bani Bu Ali under their Shaikh, Ali bin Abdullah bin Salim, arrived in the “Nur ul Bahr ” on the 27th November and have been lodged in Khan Sahib Nasib bin Muham mad's mosque. They were originally sent for to assist the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in his negotiations with the rebels but, on arrival here, refused point blank to go. The Shaikh remarked, it is said, that he was more usefully employed in guarding His Highness Saiyid Taimur and that, if the British troops left Maskat, the Hinawiya, on whom His Highness was relying, would come and shoot down Saiyid Taimur in his own burza. It is said that these Bani Bu Ali are drawing pay for 300 men, while they only number 100 actual ly. The usual crop of complaints, from the peaceful inhabitants of the town against these Bani Bu Ali ruffians, has sprung up and the Political Agent has had to address a remonstrance to Saiyid Taimur on behalf of his Baluch peon Abdul, whose house was robbed the other night. His Highness replied that the Bani Bu Ali would be leaving in two or three days’ time and that he would endeavour to arrange for compensation to the sufferer. 540 The negotiations do not appear to proceed smoothly and reports have come in from Samail that the rebels are opening their mouths very wide. One version says that Hamiyar and As-Salami demand the cession of the customs of Maskat and Matrah when they will serve Saiyid Taimur, who can remain on as Sultan. The well meant efforts of Isa bin Salih al Harathi at reconcilia tion have been rewarded by his too being styled “ Kafir ” by the other insur gents. Another rumour states that three Hinawiya have been killed up at Samail2 and that firing has been heard in the -vicinity of Fort Samail. The reports are probably exaggerated but certainly do not encourage any hopes of a speedy peaceful solution. 541. His Highness the Sultan received a letter from Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid saying that Isa bin Salih was informed by a letter from As-Salami that Shaikhs Hamaiyar bin Nasir Riyami, sons of Hilal bin Zahir, late Wall of Nizwa, Hamad bin Nasir bin Hamaid ‘Attain and Mohanna al ’ Ibri arrived in Samail. He also said that Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal of Hhahira had arrived in Sib and that Shaikh Abdullah bin Sa’id al Khalili wished to eometo Maskat and requested the use of the steam cutter. 542. Hearing that the Wali of Sohar had been disposing of His Highness’ horses and other property, Saiyid Taimur despatched Saiyid Nadir on the 25th in the “ Nur ul Bahr” to enquire into the report. Saiyid Nadir returned on the 27th bringing with him Mozaffur bin Sulaiman bin Suwailim, Wali of Sohar. He was immediately made a prisoner and sent up to the fort Mirani. v S. G. P.

In continuation of this office letter No. 8695, dated. 7th December 1918, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the communication, marginally cited, which has been received from the 'Political Agent at Maskat, reporting the progress of events in ’Oman. Extract from Maskat News No. 1232 for the week ending 20th December 1913. 2, Extract from Maskat News No- 1232for the iceek ending 30th December 1913 {Received 26th December 1913), On the 17th His Highness the left for Sih in the — (&lt; MlUT ul Bahr. ” The same day His Highness’ steam-cutter was despatched to Kuraiyat to enquire into a case of robbery from the shop of a British subject. She re turned on the 18th and the “Nur ul Bahr,” with His Highness onboard, on the 19th. 573. This Kuraiyat incident is a curious one and we have not yet arrived at the truth of the affair. A reference is invited to item No. 382 of this diary for the week ending the 13th September, when it was reported, in all good faith, that an askari of the Wali of Kuraiyat had shot dead a Bedouin of the Bani Battash. The Bunniah whose shop has recently been looted by the Bam Battash under the leadership of a certain Shaikh Sultan bin Muhammad bin Shamaz, puts his loss at $15,000 of which $4,000 are his property, while the balance belong to influential Bunniahs of Maskat and Matrah. This Bunniah, Jairam Nanji, is the principal Bunniah of Kuraiyat and he has had in his service for the past four years a Baluch, Abdulla bin Muhmmad Hoti, who is practically a native of Kuraiyat and has been in Hindu service, though not in that of Jairam Nanji, for many years. There was some trouble in August between this Baluch agent and a Bedouin of the Bani Dhakar and the Baluch is re ported to have struck the Bedouin, but this fact has only been elicited from Jairam Nanji after close cross-examination. Again, as reported in September, there was the affray between the Wali’s askari, now reported to be a Hadhrami who has since been discharged, and the Bani Battash, According to Jairam Nanji, the affair was trifling; the Wali sent the askari to demand tribute of a Battashi and, if he refused, to bring him to the Wali’s barza in Kuraiyat. The Battashi did refuse and loaded his gun and said that he 'would shoot if interfered with. On this the askari returned to the Wali, when the fort ivas put into a state of defence, the Wali thought matters sufficiently menacing to come and report in person to his late Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal and the British subjects of Kuraiyat came in a body to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul to ask for protection. It will be seen that this report differs materially from the rumours current in Maskat in the middle of September.

Dated 9th April 1914 ( 5. 40 p.m.) Benn reports by letter from Masqat under date 5th April series of events from 29th Marbh. General situation appears disquieting and Sultan's efforts to raise money and enlist foreign aid do not reassure me. Following are most significant items of news: (1) Sultan has apparently appealed to Wall of Basrah for help in money or men. (2) A Jamadar Qasim, lately returned from Basrah, is said to have arranged with a Pathan *Abdur Rahman, Jamadar Ohokldar of llesors dray Mackenzie Basrah, to enlist S00 Pathans for service with Sultan. (5) An attempt is to be made to enlist Baluchis from Bampur. (4) 'All bin Salim, late Sultan's cousin, accompanied by 'Abdul 'Aziz, French Consulate dragoman, visited French Con sul three times on 5rd April. V/e cannot regard with equanimity any of these measures: (1) It is difficult to see what possible response Wall Bas- rah can give to this wild appeal and 1 think Political Agent might simply address a remonstrance to the Sultan showing its futility and folly* (2) and (5) Unorganised Pathans and Baluchis will onlj add to disorderly elements in town and probably decamp with any rifles and ammunition given them, possibly purchasing others. They will be entirely useless against local araos. Political Agent should emphatically discourage these plans. (4) I think political Agent should endeavour to learn inde pendent!* and by direct enquiry from His Highness signifi cance of 'All bin Salim*s visits to French Consul. A talk over situation with his French Colleague night possiblyposs^^ljr ©licit. ubc_.' , i l infon#Rtion* H© should. r©por*t Tssult by telegraph, Tim© has, I think, now come for a straight talk with sultan pointing out th© idiocy^^y of wasting money on his arab forces. The 'Omani tribes are following out their old policy of bleeding sultan. One section draw pay from him and render no service in exchange, the other are in possession of his territory and feed on his estates. He should be warned that we will not lend money to be squandered in these direc tions and shall forbid our subjects to lend him money either, until he gives us guarantee that these loans and the revenues of the country are being spent in serious efforts to pacify it, especially the Wadi Samail. For t&amp;e present, it seems impossible o do anything except stick to the Masqat Matrah enclave organise the Levy Corps and prepare for an advance to Samail in October next. The object or this advance would be o install Nadir, or some other well qualified selection of Sufctan there as Governor, have Forts at Bidbid and Samail put in thorough order and garrisoned by at least a company each of the new Levy Corps, whose head quarters should be in Sib. It would probably be necessary to leave a double company with machine gun section at Bait al FalaJ to frighten off any marauding raids down Wadi 'Adai behind back of Wadi SamAil. Political advisers, preferably selected native i of India, paid from Customs revenues and in close touch with Political Agent, would be required&gt; one at Masqat xor Sultan and one at Samail for Nadir. Latter could gradually in consul tation with Nadir subsidise selected tribal petty c s to maintain communications from Samail :o Sib and Masqat* When these arrangements are complete, our troons could witn- draw. It is essentially a cold weather job and would necessi tate employment of troops for from two to three non oho next winter and maintenance of Bait al Falaj garrison to the end of the year. But it seems the only hope of re-establishing Sultan's authority, a useful asset to us. As price 01 this material assistance, Sultan should undertake to manage MasqatMasqat and Matrah customs under our advice and devote Zanzibar subsidy to expense of Levy Corps and secret but effective understanding that he will correspond with no foreign governments unrepresented at Masqat exceptlthbough us. In our turni, 7e bear all costs of expedition to re-establish his authority in aamail and balance of expenditure on Levy Corps.TELEGRAM Regd . No. ..

If, on the other hand,our effoits are. to be confined to pro tecting the Mascat &amp; Matra enclave only*.then I.think.that 2 ships would probably suffice for service between Darsait and Sidab. In the latter case,however, and,in view of.the preset activity of.the rebels &amp;.their menacing attitude I am of opin ion that one wing ot a regiment,instead of a double company, should be sent, to Mascat as soon as possible.!* Max* .

By Order,y /6S ' Tranolation of article in Basrah newspaper 'Sada-ad-Daatur' No. 27/69 dated lot May,1914. Masqat&gt; (By our learned correspondent there:-) How long and whereto? Here is found,on the sea-shore of Masqat,a youth whose head is covered up and whose mind is disturbed,shaking his j ! fingers in the open space as if indicating the throbs of h^s heart,which imply,'How long and whereto.'? ' Here Is a youth who has beer taught events as to , how is the love of mother-land and as to how is the taste of independence - the shadow of which he sees to be withdrawing fiv&gt;m him every day,while he is utterly unable to do anything, for there is no power or control to check the evils which befall his country at present and future. So,how long and whereto shall this load? I have written previously and described the which took place around Barkah and how the wheel of fortune, against the Ruler of Masqat,who enlist d the assistance of the English,and that of the Bani Battash tribemen,who were around quryat,and I promised your readers to furnish them with the details concerning these two questions. In fulfilment of my promise,! state the following as a service to the Dastur and Truth:- The siege of Quryat was prolonged and brought distress for its inhabitants,who were unable to. defend &lt; ♦ the evils which have befallen them. When themselves against the evil ^ -u « rare!vino- reinforcement was their patience in the hop© of t an, «&gt;., th. to™ to the .r»r ro-ovlne .&gt;■»* »*'•» ' th, ontorod it triumphantly on th. next W- thl. n... roach., h,» «t harh.h.th. liulot did not light of th. affair and procd.d to Quryat on yaohtf.hlch ... a,co»p.nl.d h, th. Brlti.h Ship. * . Vtat Quryat,tha British ship opened her guns on the town in compliance with the Ruler*s request and demolished it. The enemy ran away after loosing many lives,hut the town was demolished so badly that there remains not a single house worth living in. When the Ruler attained this object and was satisfied, he returned to Barkah,where he found that the revolutionists had prepared to attack the town from a certain road by which the ship’s shells could not reach them except after the demolition of the town. The Ruler has only a few tribesmen with him,as the majority of them dispersed when they saw the events which occupy my mind as to the future of Masqat and its independence. As to the English, it appears to me that their desires will not end with the bombardment of the rebels and they desire that the reins of affairs should be entrusted to them. In another word, they want to deal the last olow to the independence of Masqat,but there are many things hidden in time which are only known to God. Again,in the issue No.29/89 dated 16th May,it states How wore the scenes of battle at Barkab* (By our learned correspondent) When the town ol Quryat »s totally demoliohad and there remained no inhabitants in it,the Huler returned to Barkah as he found that the enemy had returned to attack it. The readers must have noted from my previous letters as to how the Ruler's forceswere disperaed and how the number of his men was diminished as compared to the ever-increasing number of the rebels,but this did not prevent the Ruler from persevering against his opponents. It behoves me here to mention the extraordinary courage and bravery displayed by Saiyid Nadir in ignting against the enemy despite the small number of his men, so that it may remain as a lasting monument to him. The enemy attacked Barkah in.8 /or in the afternoon and triod to entor it by force of arms,but aiyi^ Nadir stood as a barrier before him. Having divided hi party into two sections,ho kept one between the town and the house of Wail Sulairaan which had been occupied by the enemy, while he proceeded with the other section to the right of the army,when a hot fight took place between both sides, Saiyid Dhiyab,Saiyid Nadir’s uncle,used sometime to go between the two sections and encourage thorn to persevere and sometime ex posed himself to death side by side with Saiyid Nadir until they compelled the enemy to retreat to the coast where he was a target to the shells of the British ship,which played an important part in the fight. The enemy stood between the fire of the ship's guns and the volleys of Saiyid Nadir for some time and then retreated as far as Balad Nakhl. He has nfet ventured to resume war up to now. The number of the one y s killed and wounded is great,but I have not learned the proper Teckoning. This will come to light of course and I shall state it. The section of 3ani Abu Uassan°*pf the tribes fchich have thrown in their lot with the Ruler of Masqat,, deserted from the army. The sultan ordered that they should be overtaken an,. fired upon if they refuse to return to the army, mis was done killed and many as they refuse compliance,and 3 of them were wounded.

Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian oulf, To-The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have tbe honour to forward, in case it may he of interest, a translation of an article, which appeared in a recent number of the “ Sada-ad-Dastur ” of Basrah in regard to events in Oman. Translation of article in Basrah newspaper “Sada-ad-Dastur” No. 27—69, dated the 1st May 1914. Maskat. (By our learned correspondent there.) How long and whereto ? Here is found, on the sea-shore of Maskat, a youth whose head is covered up and whose mind is disturbed, shaking his fingers in the open space as if indicating the throbs of his heart, which imply, “ How long and whereto ,, ? Here is a youth who has been taught by events as to how is the love of mother-land and as to how is the taste of independence—the shadow of which he sees to be withdrawing from him every day, while he is utterly unable to do anything, for there is no power or control to check the evils which befall his country at present and future. So, how long and whereto shall this lead ? I have written previously and described the fights which took place around Barkah and how the wheel of fortune turned against the Euler of Maskat, who enlisted the assistance of the English, and that of the Bani Battash tribesmen, who were aiound Kuriat, and I promised your readers to furnish them with the details concerning these two questions. In fulfilment of my promise, I state the following as a service to the Dastur and Truth. The siege of Kuriat was prolonged and brought about distress for its inhabitants, who were unable to defend themselves against the evils which have befallen them. When their patience in the hope of receiving reinforcement was exhausted and they were tired out by the siege, they surrendered the town to the tribesmen after removing what they liked and the enemy entered it triumphantly on the next day. When this news reached him at Barkah, the Euler did not make light of the affair and proceeded to Kuriat on board his yacht, which was accompanied by the British ship. On his arrival at Kuriat, the British ship opened her guns on the town in compliance with the Euler’s request and demolished it. The enemy ran away after losing many lives, hut the town was demolished so badly that there remains not a single house worth living in. When the Euler attained this object and was satisfied, he returned to Barkah, where he found that the revolutionists had prepared to attack the town from a certain road by which the ship’s shells could not reach them except after the demolition of the town. The Euler has only a few tribesmen with him, as the majority of them dispersed when they saw the events which occupy my mind as to the future of Maskat and its independence. As to the English, it appears to me that their desires will not end with the bombardment of the rebels and they desire that the reins of affairs should be entrusted to them. In another word, they want to deal the last blow to the independence of Maskat, but there are many things hidden in time which are only known to God.f f A^ain, in the issue No. 29-69, dated 16th May, it states : Eow were the scenes of battle at Barkah. (By our learned correspondent.) When the town of Kuriat was totally demolished and there remained no inhabitants in it, the Euler returned to Barkah as he found that the enemy had returned to attack it. . The readers must have noted from my preTious letters as to how the Euler’s forces were dispersed and how the number of his men was diminished as compared to the ever-increasing number of the rebels, but this did not prevent the Euler from persevering against his opponents. It behoves me here to mention the extraordinary courage and bravery disnlaved by Saiyid Nadir in fighting against the enemy despite the small number of his men, so that it may remain as a lasting monument to him. The enemv attacked Barkah in the afternoon and tried to enter it by force of arms, but Saiyid Nadir stood as a barrier before him. Having divided his party into two sections^ he kept one between the town and the house of Wali Sulaiman which had been occupied by the enemy, while he proceeded with the other section to the right of the army, when a hot fight took place between both sides. Saiyid Dhiyab, Saiyid Nadir’s uncle, used sometime to go between the two sections and encourage them to persevere and some time exposed himself to death side by side with ^aiyid Nadir until they compelled the enemy to retreat to the coast where he was a target to the shells of the British ship, which played an important part in the fight. The enemy stood between the fire of the ship’s guns and the volleys of Saiyid Nadir for some time and then retreated as far as Balad Nakhl. He has not ventured to resume war up to now. The number of the enemy’s killed and wounded is great, but I have not learned the proper reckoning. This will come to light of course, and I shall state it. The section of Bani Abu Hassan, one of the tribes which have thrown in their lot with the Euler of Maskat, deserted from the army. The Sultan ordered that they should be overtaken and fired upon if they refuse to return to the army. This was done as they refused compliance, and three of them were killed and many wounded. The chief gunner of the Maskat Government contracted a severe fever while he was in the front near Barkah and was brought to Maskat where he died on the 6th Jamadi II, being mourned by all in view of his great services in the war. The Government have seized 13 notables of Barkah and imprisoned them as there had appeared proofs of their treason, and it has been confirmed to the Euler that the Omanis do not desire to assist him much as he extends his boundaries to them. The Baluchis and Persians who fight in conjunction with the army have received the favours of the Euler in view of the proof they have given of their sincerity. The British Government have made no condition for its assistance to the Euler, but it is sure that the advantage derived by Britain from this assistance would be enormous even if it has not come to light.1, (nfe) X 1 (7 /_ • I No. 1659, dated Bushire, the 31st May 1914 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to report that advices have been received from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, under date 9th May, that the Shaikh of Abu Thabi, after vainly trying to persuade the Shaikh of Dihai to join him, has started for Baraimi with a view to collecting forces and proceeding to Sohar and thence to Alaska! by sea to the assistance of His Highness the Sultan against the rebels. 2. On the 25th May, the Political Agent reported that His Highness had in contemplation various schemes for levying enhanced taxes 25 per cent, ad valorem on — (1) merchandise coming from interior for export to coast towns; (2) on all imports leaving coast towns for the interior; (3) prohibition of all food stuffs to coast towns which are general ports for the interior. Partly, owung to the Political Agent’s arguments and partly, the Political Agent thinks, to His Highness realising that he cannot enforce these orders without a reliable customs staff and the assistance of His Majesty’s ships, for neither of which has His Highness cared to ask the Political Agent, these schemes have now been abandoned or reduced to little or nothing. On receipt of these reports, I addressed the Political Agent, Maskat, as follows :— “ While reluctant to dissuade His Highness from any measures likely to reassert his authority over his rebellious tribesmen, I cannot but view with apprehension the despatch of troops from the plague-stricken Trucial Coast to the interior of Oman. Nor can I forget the enormous cost, without any corresponding advantage to His Highness, of this Shaikh’s former efforts to assist His Highness ”. “ Indeed, a more effective way of reasserting His Highness’s authority would appear to be, now that he has with British assistance, inflicted a serious reverse on the rebels, to endeavour to ascertain whether his subjects of the interior have or have not serious grievances against His Highness’s officials and to seek to conciliate them by better methods of administration and not by large gifts in money without corresponding return in service. The same thought has probably occurred to you and no doubt you will endeavour to turn His Highness’s thoughts in this direction rather than where they seem now tending, viz., punitive measures that can only lead to further disturbances and heavy expenditure. “ It would be well if His Highness could be induced to discourage the Abu Thabi expedition. ” I venture to hope that these instructions are sufficiently in accord with the policy of the Government of India in Oman as to meet w r ith approval and that the terms and method in which they have been conveyed may be found free from objection. / / r * ' SOonfidential ♦ KOof 1914.

August 1914 j&amp;y dear Knox, I an not reporting the following *^ufRouro 11 in My diary as they hare not been confirmed from any reliable source abd therefore scarcely deserre a place in any official commun ication. 1 also do not wish to appear as an alarmist:- (l) There is a strong rumour that the rebels intend to take vig orous action on the coast &lt;x against Hascat after the Id. Both Mr. Barney, the missionary here,and Dr. Worral at Matrah hare received news to the above effect from the interior, while H.H. before his departure on tour hinted at possible renewed activity on the part of the rebels after the Id. Dp* Worral told me yesterday that his informants state that owing to the withdrawal of the ships ( it is apparently thought that all H.M.ships have left the Gulf) on account of the war the rebels intend to make another effort to capture Barka, Quar- yat &amp; other coast towns A if they find that no British men of war come to H.H.’s assistante then they intend to try a concent rated night attack mm in 'overwhelming numbers' on Matrah A Mas- cat. It is,I know, the same old threat/ we have so often heard before but this time we may perhaps be pardoned for taking the matter more seriously owing to the different situation that has been created by the outbreak of war with Gormany &amp; the fact that ex aggerated reports of Gerraah successes against the British and French forces xkxinuty are already being circulated in the interior. Worral informed me that the Imam had already given orders to ’mobilize f after the Id. As regards liatrah we are pretty safe as the Bait al Falaj troops may be relied upon to repulse maatm any attack made in thAt dir ection. They would probably inflict a ’crushing defeat’ on any large body of rebels if the latter will only give them the cnance. But Mascat in the absence of a man of war is not perhaps so secure -especially if the rebels managed to take Sidab A advanced via the Sidab pass. We have the armed launch 'liashona' in harbour A if it is intend ed to allow her to xmmAkitiuae remain here, her 3Pr. A Paxim mount ed ih the Fort ought to be sufficient to/i defeat the rebels by day. But as the Mashona has ns search ligh$ it might be more difficult to protect Mascat from a night attack.

I have the honour to report the following inci- -dent for your information* On the morning of the 16th August the Oil leer Commanding tfce Bait al FalaJ raporuod by telegram that the * regimental dhobi’s son had been shot dead and a Lian.oe n^ik of the regiment wounded by a party of '^dnashec' in the hills to the N.W.of one of the outlying picquets at Bait al Fal aj • As soon as the news reached Head Quarters the troops were turned out to scour the hills with,however, no result* The following is an abreviated account of the affa*&gt;* as given by the Officer Commanding troops The Non-Commissioned officer of No*l Pioquet had seen a boat land some men on the beach within sight of their post. He despatched a Lance Naik and 2 men to ascert- -ain who they were. They proved to be harmless people who had come to get stone from a quarry hard by* The dhobi’s son had preceded the parjjy to the beach for the purpose of collecting shells. He returned with the Lance Naik. Else- —where in the vicinity the headman of the \.athaiya village (3 miles from Bait al FalaJ) was out grazing his camels*He saw in the distance what he considered to be a party of 'budma.shes” and as the neighbourhood is a favourite hauntof t/fceivoB and several InstanceB of oamej steal ing l.aving occurred the headman proceeded to fire on the 'hudmaBhea' at long range#The • , hudmaohaa M not seeing 'where the firing had cone from promptly returned it aiming at the nearest object they could see moving in their vicinity# This happened to be the Lance Naik and the dhobi *s son who were about 400 yards distant* The dhobi's son was hit in the thigh and his femoral artery was severed* He died almost at once. The Lance Eaik was wounded in the wrist, but was able to let off one round after which his magar- -zine jammed with his blood. The 'budmashes' are said to have disappeared into the hills in oh 3 direction of the Kurrum village. Wo trace of them was found in the neighbourhood though a search was made ior several hours, by the troops. The Officer vomuianding attaches no bl ime to the Wathaiya people. .This incident occurring at a momeiit when strong rumours are current locally of the rebels' intention to renew their hostilities on Masqat ( Matrah after the Id at once gave colour to the above reports and some local excite- -ment resulted in the town. b. As a result of enquiries tfhioh His Highness has ^ made it seems that the 'budmashes' were a portion of a gang of Eani Pattaoh who have recently been harrasaing the neighbourhagd of Qaryat. They direct their operations from the village cf Hail to the S.W.of Qaryat and have already killed 4 Baluchis of the Qaryat village. Their practice is to snipe at any one they see on tho outskirts of the village. British subjects have been refused per- -mission to return to Qaryat which place they vacated before the bombardment of the town by •?{•*-&gt;# Dai muoutb in April last. His Highness has informed me that his inform- -ation shows that a party of Fani Battash recently left y Hail for the Wadi Hat at .From these they detached a smaller party to the hills round Wathaiya with instruct- —ions to loot camels and snipe at any 'friends o: the£ f Sultan'. His Higtinees thinks that the 'budiaaBhea' who fired on the Lance Maik and killed the dlohi'e son were uitjuibors of till Is £ 2 ?Kig&lt; He a3 so infonaa me he has heard t»hat it; is r the intention of B^ni Eattaah to her^ss the Bait a3 JedaJ post after the Id and that their attention will then be specially directed to the Ruwi pu^t# The Officer Commanding at Fait al FalaJ has been warned arid has feHKH made his arrangements accordingly# A copy of this report is being posted to the Hobble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.

After Compliments:- There is nothing fresh to^ communicate except the nev/s of the meeting which took place in ITizv/a.. At first Shaikh /// Isa and H&amp;myar conversed together apart from the others. When they had agreed on a certain matter Hamyar authorised Isa to speak on the former’s behalf although there had been stories about Isa being jealous of the others. Afterwards all the Shaikhs of Oman,with the exception of Nasir bin Hamid al-Attabi,of Bahia, v/ho had sent word that Hamyar v/ould represent him, came in and. parleyed. Bventu -ally they all agreed and gave mutual promises to make a common attack on Masqat after the Id; further it was agreed that each 'Shaikh will 'carry ' his own foil o\ver$, i *e .mount or maintain themselves, Those of the Hinav/is who cannot do so will be provid- -ed. for by Isa, and similarly Kamyar will provide for the Ghafifi They dispersed on the above being agreed upon. The Imam is proceeding to al-Maawal on the 4th. (24.10.14.)and all the other tribesmen are returning to their homes. God knows the end of it allI Further we know that the Bani-Batash intend * for certain to attack Bait-al-Falij during the Id and they will take with them the rogues they can find. Your orders were received today,but do not expect A.hmed-bin- Kamid to come to you. Be so good as to keep this confioential. shall come after the Id, if you so desire. Usual Ending. True Translation; S.H.:I*H* told me that one of the followers of the Imam rose up and spoke in the following strain:- ihat the Imam is a poor man and his Govt: is poor and can not afford*i to finance the necessary military schemes and operat- -ione which are so 'badly needed for the up-holding of the true cause of Islam and that of the Imamj; that as the speaker was sure that each and every man there present would follow the Imam and obey him in everything in future,as in the past, he,the speal -er would venture to suppose that each Shaikh should make his own preparations and arrangements to equip and maintain his ov/n followers in every way for the coming struggle and should#/ 'be ready and willing to march in any direction to which the Imam might direct him to ptoceed. Another man rose to acknowledge the truth of the first speaker^ remarks about the Imam’s piety etc* but opposed the motion regading each Shaik’s finding his own mens’food and equipment, as he and some other Shaikhs also were td^poor to|ldo so. He also said that unless the Shar^iyah district people join them fully in their next expedition they of Oman could not do anything. The chief Shaikh of Shariqiyah, Isa bin Saleh, not replying, no further speeches were made, but the Shaikhs present began to talk in groups of twos and threes and to exchange views. The result was that it was decided to hold another meeting at Nizwa after the Id-al-Haj. Another report received by H.H. says they have decided to march down on Masqat after the Id. Isa-bin-Saleh’s letter to H.H. is attached with full transla- -tion.- 4. ^ ^ t/t**'' * * - y we to inform you,when I nav. v&gt;-trr 0 + i, . v^.w. en i sa^ him at noon yesterday, that he hR8 received anoth « r ^port atout the Meti B « at Klzwa.from a man Wh ° heard U from Kahonm * &lt;1 Abdullah al Khaim (son of the Khalili 5heikh Wh0 * fc8 murdered lately near 7ab«h) who was present at the meeting. It is as followe;- Sten tlie Eeetin * *** ful1 the !■«» spoke despairingly,sayin* he was poor and unable to cope with the affaires of Cisan especially as soae of the Sheikhs £ ave his, no help,and a0 re especially as the bit- -est of them,Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al-Harithi.was found to be un-sym- -pathetic and insincere to the laam and his followers. ?he Imam 88ld th8t ur “ 1er the circumstances, each shaikh should do what appears test -.o him,and noone would be held responsible for anything any longer by the Imam. In short,h» hinted his resignation of the posit -ion,5tnd left the people to make their own arrantementc, of the Shaikhs spoke up sayin* that they were bound by sol- -cr.r. vowa to follow and obey their Imam,whoa they would continue to -e.ere and obey in everything. They prayed the Imam to give them c.hy orders which he thouj^t fit and necessary. The Imam delegated his authority to Isa bin Saleb,who was to gin gi r e oiders or advice to the Shaikhs, but Isa transferred his author, -:ty to Haiayar f who gave it back again to Isa bin Saleh. Thereupon Isa aro«e and spoke with great earnestness saying that in spite of what was said about his cold and unsympathetic attitude towards the and his cause,he would show by his deeds that he was truly loy- -al,aiid in order to reassure all concrer.ed Isa went up and made the Imam's Bai'at' anew, taking a solemn oath to be true and loyal to nim. Then the Imam spoke saying that they should all prepare to attack Masqat. This,he said,must be done in the begining of the next year ( next Ho barren, i • e .an a month or so) and in this way A few hundred Arabs from the Interior should Join the 5'ani rat -tash and this force 'rabble} should first advance and attack the troops in many groups and at various points and at different tines. rhi ’ ! of attacks fro® Vie hills should be slosrly drreloppeedcvcloppt?^ and aided by a surprise attack on shore to commence from Mughab, (the beach to the east of the British Agency) where small bodies of men should be landed in small badans at sunset,or before dawn, when everyone in Masqat would be either asleep or busy. The main body of the Arabs (rebels) should follow up and deliver a general attack after the advanced force had harrassed the troops by sur- -prise night-attacks. This report is regarded by H.H. as probably correct,but H.H.is trying to obtain confirmation of it from other sources. I am keeping this strictly confidential as H.H. atb first said he wanted to convey it to you personally when next he sees you,but later decided to communicate it to you through me 26.10.14.270 • Kegd, No.., Dafeed 27/10/14 n7 R) Telegram (P) From To • • ^enn British Consul Resident Bushire and Foreign 270 Reference Imam’s Rising. Hiw Highness the Sultam has received information that Imam hxx held a,n important meeting at Nixwa on 16th.October which v/as attended by Sheikh Hamyar and Isa bin Saleh,Chief of Shariqtya,and many other leading Sheikhs. It was proposed that operations on a large scale should be undertaken against the Sultan, but as the meeting was not unanimous it was decided that the meeting should re-assem -ble after the Id-al-Zuha when final decision of Imam would be announced. H.H. tells me he has gathered from a letter addressed to him by Isa. bin Saleh that the rebels mean to g±.x take the offensive while another report he has received states that they will cer tainly attempt an attack on Mascat after the Id. Inf orman t/Sul tan that at the^ meeting the Germans v/ere represent ed as having vanquished the Allies and their successes were applauded, H.M.ships were also represented as being so busily engaged else- -where as to preclude any chance of their being able to bisit K.H. thinks that, encouraged by above belief/and recent success ful raid on garrison outposts already reported by me, the rebel? will attack Mascat and Matrah about November 6th.

Please refer to my telegram ,No.270 dated 27th.October. Imam * s rising. Further confirmation has been received by letter® addressed to Sultan of undoubted determination of Imam to attack Mascat. All the local Sheikhs have undertaken to supply quotas of * men at their own expense and it has been arranged that the Imam with his forces are to concentrate at Bid-bid whence a combined • ^ attack will be directed on Maacat about the 2nd,Moharram ( 21st. Hovember). Isa bin Saleh is reported to have definitely thrown in nis lot wit with the Imam and the Ibriyin tribe have joined the movement. All the above rej)orts are dated prior to the declaration of war with Turkey and it is now thought that the latter announcement will teni to act as a further incentive and induce many to join the Imam's standard who would otherwise not have done so. I am well aware that similar threats in the past on the part of the Imam have proved to be x«x« kiuff nothing more than bluff,but there is now ample justification for treating the present threat a and general situation more seriously. I think it would be un wise to ignore the most distinct warnings which His Highness has received from various parts of the interior. The garrison at Eait-al-Falaj would ordinarily be sufficient for the defence of iiathra alone, but if the rebel movement should assume the propor- -tions which are now indicated and which the present situation 1 1 renders extremely likely, then the present strength of troops ; would be insufficient for the protection of Matra and quite inad equate for the protection of British interests at both Matra and Mascat together. Dor this reason I beg to support the reccommend -ation made by the O.C.Troops in the Persian Gulf in his telegram Ho. 8 G. dated Ath.Hovember to the effect that a Regiment should be sent here and that a man-of-war should if possible also be despatched.

The whole question of reinforcements for Mascat entirely depends on the amount of credence which WU&amp;ixfcft '° e a:i vsn t0 tne inforrn ' -ation which is being received by H.H.^the Sultan from the in- -terior. As I have already plained in a former telegram, the Supopean situation and the general conviction thatbexists that we are at present quite unable to send reinforcements are acting as incentives to the rebels and certainly justify our regarding the Imam's present attitude much more seriously than we/ have done on former occasions.

If for the moment it is difficult to arrange rein- ■ forcements to the extent indicated I venture to suggest that ■ 4 many as can be conveniently spared should be despatched as soonas possible and that if any reinforcements are being sent for the 3hat-al-Arab they might be detained here on their way for a short time and some of them landed, if necessary, by way of a demonstration.

The Sultan certai) -ly takes the situatien most seriously mainly because ©win* to German or other influence in the interior the Imam and hie Sheiks are under the impressien that the British have been defeated by the Germans all along the line and that we are farjftoe busy else where to be able te spare men of war or treope te protect British interests in Oman* I believe it is all a questien of money* If the Imam can ind uoe the Sheiks te maintain the/ qoutae of men they have sworn to supply at their own expense then they v 'i — combine and an attack will undoubtedly be attempted on Mascat and Matrah in force. The Imam cannot I think do this at his own exp ense* I now heme that Hamyar has cried off, but all the bthere including Isa bin Saleh,th# most important Sheikh of them all,hat sworn to ***** fellow the Imam who is te lead the attack. In the circumstances it would be folly te ignore tfce warnings* The Sultan I am afraid cannot do anything outside Masoat. He hai stationed men on all the passes and hill tops round Mascot and sent a couple of guns tecertain watch-tdwers.

Briefly my Tlews were that it would he premature dad nnnnnnxxz^ unnecessary ta press for a man af war in view af the fact that in all prehahl]rity the affect af landing the reinforce ments that are being sent will be ta causa the rebels ta think twice bafara they carry out their datermination ta attaal if not ta compel them te abandon their concentration altogeth er. Personally I am of opinion that the chances are 100 to 1 against their attacking either Masaat or Motrah in forot •' i \ when the nows of the arrlral of more troops,which will mo doubt be magnified into treble the number actually landed, reaches them. Wa will watch very carefully what effect the landing has,and if we find that ths)^ still are determined te carry threugh their present intentien there will be time enough to ask for a man of war. If the concentration still contin ues ws may safely coneludo that the anti-British propaganda spread in the interior by threugh German agency has taken ser- prasont laus ****** hald among the tribes and that^the/rising, unlike its prsdsotssars,has assumed the farm of a*jihad* • What I think is likely ia that an haaring af the arrival ef reinforcements,the rebels will confine their activities te sending eut small parties to harrass/ year eutposts and prebab- Sldab. They will alts meet probably try to occupy the coast towns at Barka,Sib and q,uaryat - especially when thay find that no man of war has been sent to Mascat waters. This also would i' justify us in pressing for a man of war. Th.r. 1 . a. alt.rati.n in th. eituati.n in the interior and all r.p.rta .till p.lnt t. a oemhise* attack in f.rce at th. fe.tlnniac *f th.

It^ fo3 3ows:- When the meeting was fu3 3,the Imam _spoke^des- -p^iringly saying that he was poor and unab3e to cope with the affairs of ’Oman especia3 3y as some of the Shaikhs gave him no help,and more especia31y as the biggest of them. Shaikh ’Isa bin Sa3eh a3 Harithi,was found unsympathetic and insincere to the Imam and his followers.The Imam then said that,under the circumstances,each Shaikh shou3d do what appears best to him and no one wou3d be considered respon- -sible to the Imam any 3onger for anything.In short he hint- -ed his resignation of the position and 3 eft the peop3e to make their own arrangements.The Shaihhs(or some of them)spohe up saying that they were hound hy solemn vows to follow and obey their Imam,whom they would continue t6 revere and obey in everything.They prayed the Imam to give them any ders which he saw fit and necessary. The Imam delegated s authority to Isa bin Saleh who was to give orders or .vice to the ShaiKhs,but Isa transferred it to Hamyar who. ;ain,gave it back to Isa bin Sal eh.Thereupon,' Isa arose ld spoke with great earnestness saying that in spite of mt was said about his cool and unsympathetic attitude wards the Imam and his cause .he ( 1 Isa)wil 1 show by deeds ia t he is loyal and in order to reassure all conoerned.Isa rent up and made the Imam’s Ealat anew.taking solemn oath 0 ne true and loyal to him.Then the Imam spoke saying that they should all prepare to attack Masqat.This,he said, ust be done in the beginning of the next year(Moharram . . s0 \gncL in this way: A few hundreds o ext;after a month or so }an 4 r, -? -n tjhe Bani Bat/t&amp;sb. ^ +&gt; ,„ lT1 terior should join tne Arabs from the inuerruxand t/hls force(ratfble)should first advance and attach the troops in many groups and at various points and different times.

Sir, In continuation of ay recent telegrams on the sub ject of the renewed activity of the Imam, Salis-bin-Hashid A1 Kharusi,and the rebel tribes^of the interior r'have the honour submit the following report* 2. It will be convenient,in the first place,to reviow as briefly as possible the hietoryj((©f events and the attitude of the rebel tribes during the past six months (l)*In April last,owing te the hostile attitude of the reb els which culminated in their attack on and occupation of the coastal towns ef Barka and ^uaryat, K*I .3* Fex and Dart- ! -mouth were despatched te bombard the above places.

On 20th.April ths Imam wrets te the Pelitical Agent pretesting against the British aotien in fconbarding the coast towns. hnder instructions from the Gevernment of India no reply was sent to this csismunication. On 23rd.

Ks actien, under yeur instruct- -ions, was taken en this communication. (7) . By the 7th. May the situation had so improved that tt i f became possible to cancel all arrangements for the despatch of reinforcements and for ths retention of His Majesty's ships for exclusive service locally. p ( 8 ) . During the period May,Juno,July and part of August little L was heard of actual activity on the part of the Imam and his followers. This was dus to the date season which had begun early in Juke | and to ths Karasan which began in July. f3* July* (9). There new seems little deubt,however,that during thie | peried ef eenparative tranquillity disquieting influoneee had lieen at werk in the interier in the shape of pro-Goman . agents and emissaries from German £ast Afriea and elsewhere** Early in July His Highness first informed me ef the presence in Oman ef a German protege,one Hehsin bin Hilal ef Zansi- -bar, who in cooperation with one Mahomad bin Hilal in Zaa -zibar was acting as an intermediary between the Oman reb- -els and the authorities in German East Africa and inciting the former against His Highness* Mahemad bin Hilal hew since been arrested and plaeed under surveillance in India* In August^ German proteges, 8 uleiswin-bin-Haoir and his two Sens Hasir and Harith, were e&amp;pelled from Zanzibar* Suleiman originally resided in Kustaq (Oman),where he was bora, and he still owns property there. hasir was stated by His Highness te be the ^diter ef er partner in a vernacular newspaper,the An-Hajah ef Zansibar, in which inflammatery articles were written and circulated the agency in Oman through?** Shaikh SaUd-bin-Hasir ef ilascat* Suleiman and his two ssns are now under police restraint in India. During July also Mascat was visited by 8 or 9 Aurks from Basra and Censtantineple. All sf these,except three, were passing visitsrs and there seems little doubt that they employed their time in Hascat in dissemainating pre-German propaganda ( vide Hr.

At this time also / it became known to His Highness that Shaikh Isa-bln-Saleh had about the end of July met the Imam and Shaikh Haayar in conference at Makhl in order te disopss their future plan ef campaign* It was decided by them te convene a representative meeting of all the leading Shaikhs after the Id to discuss this matter* (12) • Meanwhile the Banl Battash tribe had continued te harass Huaryat, firing on tho Sultan’s steam yacht whenever it viait- -ed that place* (13) * On 16th* August a gang of Banl Battash ’badmashes’ came to Barsait and fired on a party of tho 10 fnd*Grenadiers kill- » -ing the sen of a regimental follower and wounding 1 sepoy. At the same time information reached Mascat that this tribe intended returning after the Id te attack the Bait-al-Falaj ( headquarters ef the Troops 1m Muscat) outposts,and that they would then direct their epecial attention te the Piquet r at Kuwl* (14). On 6 th. October the Sultan received a letter from the Wall ef Sur reporting a meeting between Shaikh Hamyar and the Hajrlyan tribe regarding a conference to be held at .&gt;iizwa,and warning His Highness to take precautionary measures againstagainst thsir csntemplatsA attack sn M&amp;scat. The Wali»s letter 1 contained the fellewing remark :• 'They (the retools) are ' under the false impression that the Christians are new without power and that the Germans hare advanced on them* Those are their ideas as shown toy their letters to one smother'* (10)• On 14th.

The diepereal ef the tribesmen and the less truculent attitude ef their leaders which is new netioeable is no doubt due te the news ef the arrival*ef reinforcements having reached the interior. 4, In discussing the situation with the Sultan*His Highness agreed that the despatch of re infers emente had no doubt caused the rO«la t# r«e*nsid«r their plans, hut he theught it weuld he pre- mature te assume that they had entirely abandsned their hostile Intentions afcalnst ft&amp;seat.

The purport ©f my report Ko, 308 wa s communica ted to the O.C, iiascat and. it was on this hhat he based his viev/s expressed in x±k para.. 1 of his telegram ITo 14 of 14th December to the general Staff. Briefly, Situation may be described as no longer critical. Isa inSaleh fctaxiMsuBXhas shewn Xhxxxxkxsxhxxx some indication of a desire to intervene between the Imam and Sultan but latter rejected these overtures for peace, as be mistrusts Isa bin Saleh. The arrival here of reinforcemen | ^ ^ -ts has had the effect of causing * dispersal cf the main rebel ^ concentration. The Sheiks are now reported to be disheartened v/hile Isa bin Saleh and the Imam are said to have fallen out as / the latter is desirous of continuing the struggle while the form- -or refuses to give his cooperation unless he is supplied with the necessary finds v/hich Imam declines to w ive him. Do reports have as yet been received here vs to the effect on the rebels of the news of our successes in Basra. I therefore find i 4 it difficult to offer any useful opinion until the situation de- velopes more clearly. In my opinion it would be premature to reduce the garrison until v/e are in possession of more definiteinformation as to the want of cohesion which is reported to exisj! among the Chiefs and sf the latter's desire to abandon hostilities Sultan is absent at present on a cruise and is reported :c to contemplate attacking the enemy near (guaryat. If there is no objection 1 should like to discuss matters with him when he return? next week. If,however, troops are required more urgently elsewhere th* ^e.rr- ~isen here mi*Ut he reduced immediately to the strength proposed hy O.C. troops kascat v/hich I consider is the minimum at present . required for local defence. Addressed to Clansl Kntx- Bushire and repeated to Gov. of India in the Foreign Department. Penn Political AgentTelegram,?. From- Cox, Resident, Basrah Addressed - Foreign, ^elhi Repeated - Bushire. No.100^.5. Dated 14th December 1914 Your telegram 116-D.S.. Strength of Bushire detachment viz: 4 British Officers and 198 rank and file, ie little more than that of a double Company, i’his will suffice for normal contigencies, of but in view of chronic lawlessness /\ Tangistan and difficulty in foreseeing developments that may ensue in Persia in 1915- and 1916, it would appoar unwise to make any further reductions I presume that in case of emergency Bushire could always be reinforced from Basrah. Provided Persia does not join Turkey, I do not see any likelihood of any increase in 191''-1916 being needed, if however this eventually should occur, it would presumably be necessary to strengthen all Persian gar risons . As soon as present scare at Masqat wears off,I hope it will be possible to withdraw the 95th Infantry.
