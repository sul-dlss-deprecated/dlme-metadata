Dear Brown, The English Ministry of Education have asked whether the Bahrain Petroleum Company's school is one which should be recognised for the purposes of salary, increments and contributions under the Teachers 1 (Superannuation) Act. The enquiry is made on behalf of Miss. 14.A. Young, who states that she served at the school from 2nd September, 1945, to 18th September, 1947. 2. I have also been asked to ascertain whether the school is maintained primarily for the education of British children. 3. I should be very grateful if you could kindly let me have material for reply to the above enquiries. 4. When I discussed the subject with you recently you informed me that the majority of the children in the school were British and that you would like to see the ordinary British curriculum of education adopted and arrangements made for the holding of examinations such as the Junior Cambridge. If you would like these proposals followed up, I should be grateful if you would kindly let me have an outline of the present system of education followed, including particulars regarding the number of classes, the number and average age of the children in each class and the number, nationality and qualifications of the teachers employed so that I may write to the British Council on the subject. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Pelly. Yours sincerely. R. Brown, Esquire, Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Bahrain.SECRET Copy No. ' R. A. F.
