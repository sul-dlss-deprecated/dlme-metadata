These include the rising costs of living in Bahrain, in part a result of the growth of the oil industry, population growth and housing shortages which have caused rent rises; staff changes at the observatory; and ongoing arrangements for the hire and transportation of equipment for the observatory.The correspondence towards the end of the file deals primarily with questions concerning the future of the Bahrain observatory in the wake of Indian independence, and the transfer of the Political Residency to Bahrain. Letters sent by Agency staff to the Residency raise questions over who has responsibility for the observatories at Bahrain and Sharjah, and the duplication of work between the Bahrain observatory and the Royal Air Force observatory at nearby Muharraq (ff 75, 76-82). A letter from the Political Agent, dated 3 November 1948, announces the closure of the Bahrain observatory, with the RAF observatory at Muharraq superseding its operations (ff 86-87). After the closure of the Bahrain observatory, correspondence in the file continues between the Agency and the Meteorological Officer based at the RAF's observatory at Muharraq (ff 90-96).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Upper Air Observatory, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Meteorology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001a9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001a9#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001a9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
