Other correspondents include the Italian Ambassador and the Italian Chargé d’Affaires in London.The correspondence principally discusses the following:Reports of objections from the Hejazi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quarantine measures taken by the Egyptian and Italian sanitary authorities, following suspected cases of cholera among pilgrims at Tor [El-Tor] and Massowa [Massawa, Eritrea].British efforts to persuade the Hejaz-Nejd Government to adhere to the Rome Convention of 1907, in order to secure the right to be represented at the meetings of the Office International d'Hygiène Publique (International Office of Public Hygiene).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Italian Chargé d’Affaires to London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Office International d'Hygiène Publique</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sanitation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00026a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00026a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
