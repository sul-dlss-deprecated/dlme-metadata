Manama 52 31 Muharraq 47 42 Other Posts 74 64 173 137 The increase in the strength of the State Police is due to the Special Defence Police having been with drawn from the Oil PieIds and absorbed in the State Police. The decrease in the strength of the Naturs is due to there being no suitable men for enlistment. There were no serious crimes.during the year. /Hl, Thefts were less compared to previous year. Three important thefts were those of the loss of 35,000 rounds of ammunition from the R.A.F., 18,000 rounds of ammunition belonging to the State Police and the theft by an American citizen of 20 tyres from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Cases of smuggling were less. There were 34 accidents resulting in 12 deaths and 3 serious injuries. 2. Administration . Victory over Germany and Japan were celebrated by the whole of Bahrain with enthusiasm. Mr. Belgrave, Mr. Smith and Dr. Snow availed of leave in Bngland during the year. Mr. Hutchings, Principal of the Technical School, reliquished his post on termination of agreement. Mr. Vanelin, the Director of Education, who belonged to the British Council did not return to Bahrain. The British Council sent in his place one Mr. Willey as Director oi Education. Mr. Willey too fell ill and reliquished his post. Mo new Director of Education has yet been apcointed.^ 4. Pearl Industry . \r£. The pearling season was a successful one. The catch was better and the prices more than those of tfe previous season. ■ • ^ • Public y/orks . No work of any importance was done during this year. 6. Municipalities . The work of the Municipalities was restricted to ordinary work in sanitation, town widening etc., and no important schemes were put through and carried out. The Municipalities co-operated with the Food Control Department in the work of the rationing of foodstuffs. ^4 7. Agriculture . The Egyptian Agriculturist left the Bahrain Government during the year.' £ • 8. Electric Department . The new generating set No. 4 of 206 KW capacity arrived in Bahrain in March 1945, but, owing to the necessary extension of the Power House not having being provided it was not available for service during the hot weather montiis when an additional output was required to meet increased po^or demands. The R.A.F. Muharraq commenced the operation of their own plant on 1st June and thereby released all their load from the Government Power Station. This load was of an average order of 100 KW. Despite this release, it was necessary to cut off supply to certain consumers at daily regular intervals during the above months. The sections of Manama concerned are supplied by the following feeders and the total period during which supply was stoppedwas as follows:-3 A &amp; C 264 hrs. - 11 Minutes R.N. Base Jufair 233 r» - 8 it Belgrave 196 tt - 49 tt Bazaar 73 tt - 30 n Muharraq which is supplied by its own feeder was cut off for a total period of 18 hrs. - 37 minutes. The total hours of all shutdowns aras 786 hrs. - 15 minutes during the period April/December. ^tensions to Power Supply . (1) The R.A.F. Rest House and B.O.A.C. Jetty were connected by means of a new L.T. Line and transformer from the Shaikh Palace G-udhaaibia during April. (2) The B.O.A.C. Transit Camp Gudhaibia was connected by means of a new K.T. Line and 20 ICVA Transformer during July. (3) The B.O.A.C. Rest House New Sub-Station was connected direct from the Government Power House by means of an H.T. underground cable to effect an increased supply to provide Air Conditioning during 1346. The length of this cable line is approximately 1,350 feet. Power supply will not be available on this new supply line until the new generating set, now being erected is put into service. Telephone Department . 1%/ A. * Some improvement in operation has been effected by the provision of a ringing trnasformer supplied by Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. This precludes the necessity for the wwitch- boaru operator^to call the subscriber by means of a hand operated generator after the plugging operation. Transport Departme nt . There is an acute shortage of vehicles of all types and those at present in use are almost without exception in bad condition. Most of them are old and essential spares are not available in Bahrain or India. 9. Administration of Justice . Nothing to report.4 if 10. Education . No. of schools in existence on 1.1.45 No. of Schools opened during 1945 No. of Schools closed No. of students on 1.1.45 No. of students on 51-12-45 No. of teachers on 1.1.45 No. of teachers on 31.1.45 15 2619 2736 127 - 137 Boys* Schools . All the schools are filled to capacity and in some cases the classes are overcrowded. Several appli cations for admission had to be refused. 16 students were sent to 15gypt for higher education. A small amount of school stationery was obtained through the British Council. Girls 1 Schools. 16 students passed in their final examination and most of them have been appointed as teachers. The general health of the students has considerably improved owing to regular visits to the Schools by the Health Authorities. The Annual Exhibition of needlework was a great success. Technical Schoo1 . Two new subjects have been introduced in the school, viz., Elementary Electricity and Heaving. Throe students are receiving technical education in Cairo.

BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT 1945* Statistics are enclosed summarising each section of the work among male patients of The Bahrain Govern- -ment Medical Department# A report by the Lady Medical Officer is being sent separately. EPIDEMICS . There were no epidemics this year,and Smallpox was practically non-existent. The last few years have testified to its rapid- ^ -iy diminishing incidence due to control by mass vaccination, &amp; effective quarantine arrangements# Even as late as 1940,Small- -pox was regarded in Bahrain as an everyday sporadic disease# Great credit goes to Dr: Steele the Quarantine Medical Officer and Agency Surgeon# There was no Typhus and very little Typhoid. SPECIAL DISEASES . Optha lmia# A general improvement can now be seen# The younger generation are aware of the importance and benefit of Trachoma treatment. This idea has also been instilled in the May-June and November-January periods. Benign Tertian predominated,but of a Se-sy more resistant type. 12$ of all patients seen in Manama were affected, as opposed to 10$ in 1944,the best year# It is thought that one of the factors responsible was the prevailing south wind at the end of the year,thereby carrying Mosquitoes from the date gardens into the towns. Treatment in this department is as follows Days 1 &amp; 2 . Quinine grains 30,and Atebrin 3 daily in the schools,where a trachoma clinic has been inaug' -urated. Malaria# There was a general increase all over the island,both Intravenous Quinine grains 5, or Intramuscular Quinine grains 7i daily Days 3- 7. Atebrin 4 daily* This is more vigorous than most people would agree to,but it has proved effective and in a few resis- -tant cases sometimes not sufficient.

The cerebral type is uncommon, and Blackwater Fever practically unknown. V*D. This is yet again on the increase reaching an incidence of 9 , 4 $ of all diseases seen. 3306 injections were given. Figures for the last three years are:- 1212* 972 • 1211* 11 94. 1212* 1277 * Dys entery . This has declined considerably,especially tne Amoeoic type.

Considerable detail work of a geological nature was done in the re- exa ination of ell formation samples to obtain all data possible and several water wells throughout the Island were electric- logged. Four more wells were rehabilitated during the year leaving four wells in this program which are still secured re quiring extensive re-work before they can be returned to pro duction. Four additional wells were standing which require major repair and work-over jobs one of which was being carried on at the end of the year. Observations of essential data nece. i.ary for scientific reservoir control were stepped up con sistent with the availability of personnel and equipment. Repair Several minor repairs were made to cellar and surface well connections and one major repair job started which will be carried on to conclusion. This repair job was due to corrosion of a liner. A second weir was raudded off waiting major repairs due to a leak in the casing also probably the result of cor rosion. Observations were being made at a third well to deter mine whether or not a suspected casing leak exists. A fourth well requiring a major work over job has remained mudded off throughout the year awaiting sufficient drilling personnel.r'-v . * - 3 - As stated previously repair jobs due to corrosion can be ex pected to increase year by year &amp;a the field grows older* Tabulation No. 1 shows the status of all the oil and gas wells as of Dec. 31 f 19*5 and Tabulation No. 1-A shows the status of the Company water wells as of the same date.- 10 Note to printerJ- Start a new page* PB0DUCTI0N Total oil produced during 19*5 was 7»308 f 938 net barrels or an average of 20^024 net barrels per day. The rate of production has been held practically constant throughout the year with distribution of production from the reser voir being slightly altered due to the expansion of the artificial gas cap. This has a tendency to cut down the flexibility of the field and exemplifies the need of more wells as planned in the forthcoming Development Program to maintain our desired rate of production and scientific control of the reservoir necessary for maximum ultimate recovery. Chemical treatment of several rehabilitated wells was resorted to in an attempt to restore their impaired productivities resulting from the!** security in the Denial Scheme. These treat ments have been only partially successful and there is some doubt if further treatment will completely restore their former ability to produce. Gas Injection without interruption throughout the year. The total daily injection rate has remained constant to the two Pays, however, the distribution of injected *ras was altered by increasing the propor tion injected to Second Pay and decreasing the proportion injected to First Pay. This was done to delay the capture of the First Pay by gas in combination First and Second Pay wells a condition which it was believed might be precipitated by excess channelling concomitant with higher injection rates to First Pay. Gas for injection was produced from Fourth Pay Zone ’’s'* as in the past. Gas injected into First and Second Pays has continued11 A project to bury the gas injection lines to elimi nate freezing troubles, caused by the formation of hydrates, during the winter months wes approved and this work was commenced as far as the necessary trenching is concerned. Edge Water hncroachnqerrt* Water production for the year averaged 1?01 barrels per day which is an increase of 324 barrels per day over that for 1944, Tabulation No, 2 shows the total oil and v/ater production from the field by months for the year 194J, together with the average daily production per month. The increase in water pro duction as from August was due to the return of a Siltstone edge well to production. Four wells were prepared for oil-water level observa tions in the Second Pay. These wells are strategically located, one each on the two sides aiid both ends of the structure. Water has not made its appearance at one of these locations but obser vations have been iade at the other three. Two additional water disposal wells were drilled at location 54-5F and 27-JF these taking care of the water produced from 3 wells*pected production from wells to ba drilled in the 1946 Develop- ment Program. -he live oil-gathering stations have been maintained and operated setisiactorily without any changes being necessary. Crime Oil. 7he total imports of Arabian crude during 194J were 15*649,272 net barrels. Upon completion of the 12** A-B pipe line from Arabia to the Refinery, the Zellaq Terminal was dis mantled and is now obsolete* The last cargo received through Zellaq v^as on March 3* 1945 and from January 1st to March 3rd, a total of 1,831,053 net barrels were handled through its facilities oefore being abandoned in favour of the A-B pipe line. The balance ol the Arabian crude was received thru this line with the exception of 564,2^5 net barrels delivered by tanker and unloaded &lt; at Sitra.Note to printer start new page. PrliiA; IONS Pefining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput end were augmented by the commissioning of evietlon gasoline production facilities* During the year 19*5 crude runs totalled 22,875,136 barrels of which 32% was Bahrein Crude while the balance was imported from Arabia. Shipment of products manufactured from the foregoing crude runs were divided as followsi- Aviation Gasoline Motor Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Oils Fuel Oils T.ataJU. With the ending of the war, the demand for Aviation Gasoline dropped rapidly with the result that all aviation shipping tankage was full about the end of October. All aviation facili ties were shut down at that time and still remained idle at the end of the year. The balance of the refinery continued operating at full throughput. As mentioned in our report for the year 1944i a lafge construction program aimed at increased refinery facilities and the production of aviation gasoline for military purpo$ e s^as under way at the turn of that year. Those facilities completed during 1945 included!- (a) Extension of the salt water system to all new plants commissioned, (b) No. 2 Power Plant (boiler section only) , 322,997 5 ,? 36,866 2,061,684 4,356,643 .. 5 4i&gt;3Za3fl 17 , 615,320 Barrels Barrels•(c) Butane isomerization unit.

To fill this requirement, a new 98* X 204* storehouse was started the latter part of 1945 and should be completed early in 1946* Also present plans incluae steps to convert the con struction storehouse to chemical stores for those supplies requiring inside storage, yt - 17 - Of x Ltgr. - H&lt;? 2 Power Plant An additional 3000 JCW. generator purchased in connection vith the increased operating facilities is in the process of Installation and should be available for use early in 194-6. With the completion of this unit, our total rated nominal electric power capacity will be 14,000 KW. Mdltlonal Shi- nlnr Fgcjlltles. With the large increase in shipments resulting from the increased cruderunning, additional shipping lines and higher capacity punps were necessary because of the increased number of products and to avoid loading delays. The installation of these Items was the last to be started. These consist of three new 1?” loading lines from Sitra to the New Wharf and two liew 5000 Bbl/hr. shipping pumps located at Sitra. With this equip- raent it will then be possible to load gasoline, Diesel, kerosene and fuel oil at rates approaching 5000 Bbls/hr. It is antici pated these will be completed early in 1946. fensewfty The new 30* width causeway which was indicated in the 1944 report as being built to a point about 13000 offshore was placed into operation before full completion in order to utilize it In connection with the new wharf construction. Also during, cite latter part of the year it was used to great advantage in connection with a 6500 ton cargo of bulk coke and three full cargoes of drummed products from the Drum Plant. As intimated above, the causeway construction is not yet complete, a certain amount of dirt and rock fill still being18 required to bring the roadway up to specified elevation before final grading can be completed* It Is anticipated that this work will be finished early in 19 4 6# l imt was started, located about 1800* beyond the pierhead terminus of the new causeway and connected to it by an elevated trestle capable of full scale truck traffic* This wharf is oeing constructed so as to handle bulk oil loadings as three berths the fourth berth intended for bunkering arid the receipt of incoming supplies or the loading of outgoing shipments of drummed products, etc* for receipt of incoming cargo about Jan* 5f 1946,and that all con struction will be complete for full operation about jlarch 1946* With the completion of these facilities and the new loading pumps at Sitra, it should be possible to finish any bulk oil shipment in 24 to 36 hours, thereby permitting and maintaining a good record in the dispatch of ships* During 1945 construction of a new 4 berth wharf It is expected that the south end will be ready19 Note to printer start net; page -GA_4P FAC X LIT 1LS AwaJJL The growing Company facilities and increased person nel have necessitated extensions to the Awali Village. A new housing area has been laid out and six new two bedroom and eleven new three bedroom air cooled houses have been built and twenty two bedroom houses are in the course of construction. A new sewage pumphouse was also constructed in this area. The Awali storehouse office was found to be inade quate and was extended during the year.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT. AS. I have the honour to be. Your mo^tr otfedient Servant, U\H. MENHAM) Station Manager.DURING THE YEAH 19U5 Attached is a table of statistics which are explanatory ana the following notes are given in amplification. FRfiUUj&amp;NCY OF S^RVICtiS The anticipated stepping up of frequency of Services to serve the Far Eastern theatre of war aevelopea for the first half of the year. Due to the sudden collapse of Japanese hostilities it was evident towards the latter half of 1943 that the frequency of services would tend to decline, especially in regard to the R.A.F. Flying scat Refers Programme which was planned and for which the Corporation was responsible for handling. The Corporation^ schedule Sunderland Services which transit Bahrain were extended from Calcutta to Rangoon in October. PASSENGERS In the first part of the year the greater portion of passengers was Service personnel - transient, embarking and disembarking. Towards the latter part of the year the proportion of Service personnel diminished and the majority of passengers carried was Civilian, eastbound and westbound. CARGO The figures given for Precious Cargo at the appendix call for special attention. FUTURE OPERATIONS A Lockheed Lodestar Service will be instituted once weekly Cairo/Bahrain, Bahrain/Cairo with scheduled stops at Basra , Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo. The Trunk Route Service U.K. to the Far East which will call at Bahrain en route has not been finally decided by the Corporation, as far as is known, three Trunk Services will operate through the Persian Gulf. Sunaerlanu Services will be extended to Singapore in the very near future. CONCLUSION The Corporation are in possession of all relevant data to assist in the compilation of schedules adequate to deal expeditiously with the future embarking and disembarking load of Bahrain. A policy announcement is anticipated in the very near future. Bahrain, 22nd Jan 46. AS.COp’IDEMTIAL . Confidenli*|. BAHRAIN RJOBIPT, Di(8 lllilU My dear Colonel Galloway, VICTORIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, BAHRAIN. 23rd January, 1946. i With reference to your letter No.c/43 of 7th January, 1946, I forward herewith the information requested. a) Number of the out-door patienLs - 16,800 b) Number of the in-door patients - 37 Number of operations - 774 (all minor surgical operations) d) No epidemic of any major infectious diseases occurred during the year. There was, however, a considerable increase in malaria. 3,796 cases were treated as out-patients and 10 as in-patients making a total of 3806 as against 3279 for last year. The reason for the increase appears to^e the shamal setting in late and the persistence of the KANS.

Dear Sir ANNUAL REPORT 1945 PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED MANAGER Enel. Confidential.• » • CONFIDENTIAL PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED BAHRAIN SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS FOR 1945 GENERAL War time conditions and their aftermath during 1945 again prevented the Company from obtaining personnel and equipment with which to carry out geological exploration or drilling in its concession areas in the Persian Gulf. Towards the end of the year, however, it became possible for our condon principals to make some preparations to wards geological exploration in the Trucial Coast and hinterland, and for resumption of drilling in Q,atar early in 1946. These preparations, however, were again un expectedly handicapped by new Government regulations on the purchase of essential equipment designed to restrict transactions as much as possible to the U*K. and the sterling bloc. Food supplies for its employees also created a problem particularly as regards local labour as no reliance could be placed on Arab Rulers to supply Company employees from their food quotas at reasonable cost. The problem was solved in the case of the first geological party by permis sion being obtained to draw Service rations from the R.A.F. base at Sharjah. It is hoped in 1946 and 1947 to carry out the under mentioned operations, but these must be regarded as pro visional and subject to the necessary supply of equipment being forthcoming, as far as can be forecast to date, the rehabilitation of the Qatar camp in preparation for the drilling programme should commence at the beginning of March 1946 according to plan. PROGRAMME FOR 1946 - 1947 (a) Qatar (i) Rehabilitation of Qatar camp commencing March 1946. (ii) Drilling commencing in the fourth quarter of 1946. (iii) Seismic Survey Party, supplied by Contractors, Seismographic Service Corporation of U.S.A.. will carry out work in Qatar approximately from October 1946 to December 1946. (b) Geological Exploration - Trucial Coast (i) Geological Surveys Geological mapping and liaison party based on Dubai or Sharjah commencing January 1946.(ii) Gravity Meter Surveys Two Gravity Meter parties supplied by contractors, Robert H. Ray co., of U.S.A., will carry out work in the Trucial Coast approximately from October 1946 to December 1946. (iii) Magnetometer Surveys A Magnetometer Party, supplied by Contractors, Robert H. Ray Co., of U.S.A., will also carry out work in the Trucial coast approximately from October to December 1946. 3. RELATIONS WITH THE RULER OF QATAR With the end of the war with Germany and Japan, the Ruler of Qatar showed a revival of interest in the reopening of the Qatar field. It was difficult to con vince him that the conditions created by the war must be expected to continue for some time and in effect most war time restrictions were still in force. He again drew attention to the oil developments in the territories or his neighbours, Bahrain and Arabia, and he is not easily persuaded that every effort is being made to recommence drilling and expedite production. Towards the end of 1945 he broached the subject of an advance of royalties and this was referred to the Managing Director. The Managing Director agreed to an advance of five lakhs of rupees without interest subject to the approval of the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. At the end of the year under review, this approval was awaited. It was received in early January 1946 and the present position is that the form of receipt and the conditions of the advance have been sent to London for confirmation. Relations with the Shaikh have been amicable and, apart from the question of payment in silver of the annual concession payment in 1945, no controversial matters arose. Eventually he accepted half in silver and half in notes. It is unfortunate that a new notification has appeare that notes of Rs.500, Rs.1000 and Rs.10000 denominations are not legal tender at present. This will probably cause a revival of the distrust of notes which was almost extinct 4. TRUCIAL COAST (a) Attitude of the Rulers In 1945 it was thought advisable to send a letter to all the Rulers explaining war time difficulties in commencing exploration in their territories, and the Rulers apparently accepted the situation and made no protests. (b) Oil Agreements (i) Umm-al-Quwain f on the BOth March 1945, an oil concession agreement was concluded with the Ruler ofr-\ /''N Umm-al-Quwain on terms which compare satis factorily with other concessions on the Trucial Coast. (ii) Outstanding Concession Areas The undermentioned areas, in addition to Umm-al-Q,uwain, came under discussion in 1944: (a) Fujairah (b) A1 Hamriyah (c) A1 Haira (d) Hinterland Areas (e) Ruus-al-Jibal Peninsula (f) Dibah The situation at the end of 1945, as far as the Company is concerned, still remains as described below (a) Fujairah The British Government does not offer any official comments on the desir ability or otherwise of an oil agreement. (b) A1 Hamriyah and Al Haira The British Government does not con sider that oil agreements with Al Hamriyah and Al Haira are necessary. (c) Hinterland Areas The Government 1 s view is that many of the hinterland areas are theoretically in the hands of the Trucial Coast Rulers and H.H. the Sultan of Muscat, and it is to be hoped that the Rulers will themselves be in a position to come to agreements with the hinterland Shaikhs which will permit of exploration in the areas of interest to the company. Possible excep tions will be the Beni Kitab and Beni Ka f ab tribal leaders with whom it may be necessary to conclude separate agreements later particularly if exploration extends to drilling. (d) Ruus-al-Jibal Peninsula His Majesty’s Government recognises Ruus-al-Jibal Peninsula as Muscat territory and therefore covered by Muscat concession. There is a warning, however, that H.H. the Sultan would doubtless wish to make very careful arrangements for the security of Company personnel carrying out exploration as in normal times it is rarely necessary for him to exercise his authority.te) Dibah The Government view is that two out of three sections of Dibah are covered by the company’s concessions with Muscat and Kalba. The third remaining section should be included in any oil agreement which might subsequently be made with Fujairah. 5. USE OF COMPANY AIRCRAFT IN THE PERSIAN GULF Towards the end of 1945 the company were in cor respondence with the Political Agent, Bahrain, on the subject of the use of Company aircraft in the Persian Gulf and Muscat territory. Approval has also been obtained to the construction of a company landing ground in c^atar. 6. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE - LOCAL LABOUR - ON REOPENING OF QATA” The Company proposes to conform to the Bahrein Petroleum Company and other Bahrain employers of labour as nearly as possible, on the reopening of Qatar, as regards basic conditions. Due to the remoteness of the oil camp from any bazaar or market, it may be necessary for the Company to feed its employees at least in the early stages but reasonable adjustments of pay rates will be made. In this connection, it is believed that the Arabian American Oil Co. Ltd., have pay rates which differ from those of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. In such cases it is proposed that Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited follow Bahrain. MANAGER 29th January, 1946.Sumnary of events of interest on the Crucial Ooost during the ye nr 1945. 1 .

In late November His Highness accompanied by his uncle, Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E./ x&amp;xx and other members of the Al Khalifah family went on a .shooting trip to Saudi Arabia. The party proceeded as far as Hafar where most of the shooting was done and, on their return a month later, were seen off at Al Khobar by His Highness the Amir Saud. It is said that the trip cost more than Rs.300,000. (ii) Shaikh Salman bin Mohammad, fifth son of the senior uncle of His Highness was sent to Jerusalem in April for a course of judicial training. • (iii) Khalid bin Mohammad bin Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa returned from Egypt in November.

The decrease in the strength of Naturs is due to the lack of suitable men for enlistment. There were no serious crimes during the year. The incidence of thefts was smaller than that of the pre vious year. The three most prominent cases were those in which 35,000 rounds of ammunition were stolen from the Royal Air Force, 18,000 rounds of ammunition from the State police and 20 tyres by an American citizen from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. There were 34 road accidents resulting in 12 deaths and 3 serious injuries. 5. AGRICULTURE . The Egyptian Agriculturist left the Bahrain Government during the year. (Continued)6. MUNICIPALI11 )3S. • The work of the Municipalities was confined to routine matters and no important projects were instituted. 7. PUBLIC WORKS . No new major works were carried out during this year. 8 - ELECTRICITY DEPARTMENT . (a) The new generating set of 206 KW capacity arrived in Bahrain in March, 1945, but the extension of the power House having proceeded little beyond the stage of planning and the engine having arrived minus certain essential parts, the plant was not in operation by the end of the year and the three overworked and long enduring British sets catered very spasmodically for the needs of the hard tried and perspiring population of Bahrain during a very unpleasant hot weather. Were it not that the R.A.F,*s plant at Muharraq came into operation on the 1st June and thereby released the Government Power House of about 100 KW of their load the situation would have been even worse than it was. Consumers were, during the hot weather, cut off daily at regular (sic) intervals and the total period during which supply was proportioned was as follows:- A &amp; C Feeders 264 hrs. 11 Minutes. Royal Naval Base, Jufair 233 it 8 it Belgrave Feeder 196 u 49 ti Bazaar Feeder 73 ii 30 H Muharraq, which has its own feeder, was cut off for a total of 18 hrs. 37 minutes. The total period of shutdowns for mechanical defects was 786 hrs. 15 minutes during the months April/December. (b) Extensions to Power Supply . (1) In April the Royal Air Force Rest House and the British Overseas Airways Corpora tion Jetty were connected by means of a new L.T. Line and transformer from the Shaikh*s Palace at Gudhaibiya. (2) The British Overseas Airways Corporation Transit Camp, Gudhaibiya, was connected by means of a new H.T. Line and 20 KVA Transformer during July. (3) A new sub-station for the British Overseas Airways Corporation Rest House was connected direct from the Government Power House by (continued)-5- means of an H.r. underground cable to provide an increased supply for Air Conditioning during 1946. The length of this cable line is approximately 1,360 feet and power will not be available to this new line until the new generating set, now being erected, comes into service. 9. TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT . The Bahrain Government telephone system is antiquated in the extreme and badly needs replacement. The scheme for installation of an automatic telephone exchange has, regrettably, shown little progress due to various factors. One is the tendency of the landlords of the few convenient sites to hold out for high ground rents and Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited’s unwillingness to meet their demands which renders it most unlikely that an automatic telephone exchange will be in operation in 1946. The fact remains that by the end of the year Cable &amp; Wireless had not placed the order for the new exchange much to the detriment of British prestige. 10. PEARL INDUSTRY . The pearling season was a successful one. There were about 121 pearling craft out this year. The catch was better and prices higher than those of the previous season. 11. CUSTOMS . Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Rs.25,98,098 for the year. There were 113 launches registered with the Customs on the 31st December, 1945, including those belonging to the Navy and the various companies. 12. FOOD CONTROL . During the year under review the Government again devoted a considerable amount of time, money and energy in ensuring that adequate supplies of essential foodstuffs were available for the public. o a H a sum of Rs.11,800,000 as compared to the 1944 figure of Rs.8,000,000 was spent on the purchase of wheat, millet, rice, tea, sugar, and dates. The monthly ration per adult was maintained at a high level throughout the year. Towards the close of the year the Government introduced a cloth rationing system, which should prove successful. The number of retail shops was increased and rations divided equally amongst them. During the year there was a steady stream of commodities such as potatoes, onions, fresh and dried fruits, walnuts, etc., from Persia, where the good rains of the previous winter assisted in maintaining a sufficient supply.

The following is a statement of ships that called at Bahrain during the year 1945:- British 171 American 154 Dutch 27 Panamanian 15 French 9 Norwegian 9 Italian 4 Swedish 3 Greek 2 Total 394 The total imports for the year amounted to 92,901 tons, while exports amounted to 17,326 tons. On behalf of the United Kingdom’s Commercial Corporation, for whom Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company, Limited, are the agents, the following foodstuffs were imported:- Wheat 10502401 Kilos Barley 1185378 ' Millet 982438 ' 14. ACCIDENTS WITHIN PORT LIMITS . (i) On the 24th January, 1945, a local craft laden with a cargo of dry dates, sprang a leak in the harbour and went aground. The cargo was damaged by sea water and had to be removed ashore for drying. The craft was later repaired. (ii) On the 23rd December, 1945, a boat lying at anchor laden with 300 raaunds of Persian wheat was wrecked in a strong »'shamal”. The cargo, badly soaked with sea water, was brought ashore for drying and cleaning and the boat was eventually salvaged and towed in for repairs 15. MEDICAL (General ). The medical work of Bahrain was carried out by three hospitals - Victoria Memorial, Mission, and Bahrain Government. Their reports show that the health of the community remains at much the usual level. There was no epidemic in Bahrain throughout the year due to control by mass vaccination and effective quarantine arrangements. The persistence of the Kaus wind and lack of the 'shamal' (NW) probably accounted for the higher than normal incidence of malaria. Small pox reached a very low level only 15 cases being treated in the Victoria Memorial Hospital as compared with 56 in 1944. (Continued) •-7- Venereal disease showed an increase during the year under review; this is due mainly to the reluctance of patients to undergo a complete course of treatment. (1) VICTORIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL . Lieutenant M.L.A. Steele held charge during the year except for a period from the 20th July to the 25th October when he proceeded on leave, his work being carried out by Drs. George and Storm of the Mission Hospital, Number of Out-door patients treated 15,800 Number of In-door patients treated 37 Number of operations (all minor) 774 Malaria . Total of patients treated was 3,806 as compared with 3279 cases for 1944, 1944 1945 Syphilis 85 233 Soft Cancre 6 26 Gonorrhea 98 115 (il) AMERICAN MISSION HOSPITAL . Dr, Paul W, Harrison held charge throughout the year assisted by Drs. George, ?iylrea and Storm, Out-door patients treated 18,263 In-door patiencs treated 2,114 Number of operations per formed (both major and minor) 3,906 (iii) STATE MEDICAL HOSPITAL . Dr. R.H.B. Snow held charge throughout the year except for the period from 3rd May to 25th October 1945 when he proceeded on leave. He was assisted in the Women’s Section by Dr. I.M.A, Doeg who also acted as State Medical Officer during Dr. Show’s absence on leave. Men’s Section.

Steele was in charge as Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year except for a period of leave from the 20th July to the 25th October when Dr. Bhandarkar of the State Medical Hospital officiated in his place. The quarantine service in Bahrain has arxptie progressed during the last few years, credit for which goes to Dr. Steele, whose efforts in this cause under difficult local conditions have had effect. Some idea of the progress and efficacy of this service may be gauged from the following figures of Bahrain*s worst epidemic, small poxs- Year. No. of cases 1941 (from Sept.) 193 1942 119 1943 43 1944 57 1945 14 The quarantine station is situated near Muharraq. fhe site is admirable in that it is cut off from ohe town at high tide. There are two buildings with accommodation for about 150 persons. This station is designed for local use only, it was expanded and improved in 1941 and the following years. Compulsory segregation of infected cases and mass vaccination were also introduced at the same time. No facilities for segregation of passengers from ships and ’planes, if necessary, exist at present, but it is hoped that some arrangements to this end will be made soon. A total of 62 passenger steamers and about 20 tankers and freighters were visited by the Quarantine Medical Officer during the year under review. At present no effective quarantine arrangements have been made for yellow fever, as the expense involved v/ould be too high and not justified by the circumstances, as only passengers of the British Overseas Airways Cor poration S, C' class ’planes, which touch at yellow fever infected areas en route are affected.* • THE POBT OFFICE . Mr. Rajab Ali was the Sub-post Master through out the year assisted by four clerks. 6 *The quarantine staff is too small to keep a vigilant check on the crew and passengers of country-craft.

Agency Courts . ^ Civil and criminal suits decided during tile /ear totaled 1129 and 405 respectively. T1 lr . . , iae outstanding case was that of Charles b. MlnnlcK, an American, who was found guilty of sSealing twenty motor tyres, sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and committed to the Yeravada Jail at Poona. 18. EDUCATION . Number of schools in existence on 1.1 .*45 Number of schools opened during 1945 (Continued)-10- Number of schools closed during 1945 Number of students on 1.1.1945 2619 Number of students on 31.12.45 2736 Number of teachers on 1.1.1945 127 Number of teachers on 31.12.45 137 (i) BOYS * SCHOOLS . All the schools are filled to capacity and in some cases the classes are overcrowded. Numbers of applications for admission had to be refused. According to the policy adopted the previous year to send some boys to Egypt for advanced studies, 16 students left for Cairo during the year. War time exigencies have resulted in a serious dearth of school stationery; a small quantity was, however, obtained through the British Council. The failure of the British Council to provide a Director is a great set-back to the Islands’ educational efforts. (ii) GIRLS' SCHOOLS . 16 students passed their final examinations and most of them have been appoirited as teachers. There has been a considerable improvement in the gene ral health of the girls owing to regular visits to the schools by the Health authorities. rhe annual Exhibi tion of needlework was a great success. (iii) TECHNICAL SCHOOL . Two new subjects were introduced during the year in the Technical School, viz., Elementary Electri city and Weaving. Three students were sent for further technical training to Cairo. 19- THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY . (a) General Management . Mr. Ward p. Anderson was the General Manager and Chief Local .Representative of the Company through out i,he year. Mr. Don J. Hanna, one .of the Vice-Presi dents of the company was present in Bahrain from time to time throughout the year. (b) Production and Development . Total oil produced during 1945 was 7,308,938 net barrels, an average of 20,024 net barrels per day. Che rate ox production has been held practically con stant throughout the year with distribution of production from the reservoir being slightly altered due to expan- sion oX the artificial gas cap. During the year faci lities ior the production of aviation gasoline and increased quantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war were completed and put into operation. The construction of facilities to permit the direct loading and unloading of ocean (Continued)i IM -11- ocean going ships at Sitra was commenced during the year and was progressing satisfactorily at the year's end. (c) producing Field . Although no actual development work was commenced during the year, plans were laid, equip ment and materials were ordered and some preliminary work was done pursuant to a development programme to be inaugurated in 1946. Considerable detailed work of a geological nature was done in the re-examination of well formation samples to obtain all data possible. Several water wells throughout the Island were electric logged. Four more wells were rehabilitated during the year leaving four wells in this programme which are still secured requiring extensive re-work before they can be returned to production. (d) Import of Arabian American Crude Oil . The total import of Arabian crude during 1945 was 15,649,272 net barrels. Upon completion of the 12' Arabia-Bahrain sub-marine pipe line from Arabia to the Refinery, the Zellaq terminal was dis mantled and is now obsolete. The last cargo received through Zellaq was on 3rd March, 1945, and from 1st January to 3rd March a total of 1,831,053 net barrels were handled through its facilities before being abandoned in favour of the Arabia-Bahrain pipe line. The balance of Arabian crude was received through this line except for 564,225 net barrels delivered by tanker and unloaded at Sitra. (e) Refining Operations . Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput and were augmented by the commissioning of aviation gasoline production facilities. During the year crude runs totaled 22,875,136 barrels of which 32# was Bahrain crude while the balance was imported from Arabia. Shipment of products manufactured from the foregoing crude runs were divided as follows ;- Aviation gasoline Motor gasoline Kerosene Diesel oils Fuel oils 322,997 Barrels 5,236,866 » 2,061,684 ' 4,356,643 ' 5,637,130 ' Total 17,615,320 Barrels With the ending of the war, the demand for aviation gasoline dropped rapidly with the result that ail aviation shipping tankage was full about the end of October. All aviation facilities were shut down at uhat time and still remained idle at the end of the year. The balance of the refinery continued operating at full throughput. (Continued)-12-- (f) New Refinery Storehouse . With the enlarged refining facilities installed during the last two years increased storehouse equipment was necessary. To fill this requirement, a new 98* x 204* storehouse was started in the latter part of 1945 and should be completed early in 1946. (g) Additional Generator - No.2 Power Plant . An additional 3,000 KW. generator purchased in connection with the increased operating facilities is in the process of installation and should be avail able for use early in 1946. With the completion of this unit the total rated nominal electric power capa city will be 14,000 KW. (h) Causeway . The new 30* width causeway which was indicated in last year's report ms being built to a point about 13,000 feet offshore was placed into operation before full completion in order to utilize it in connection with the new wharf construction. Also during the latter part of the year it was used to great advantage in con nection with a 6,500 ton cargo of bulk coke and three ~ full cargoes of drummed products from the drum plant. As intimated above, the causeway construction is not yet complete, a certain amount of dirt and rock fill still being required to bring the roadway up to speci fied elevation before final grading can be completed. (i) New Wharf . During 1945 construction of a new 4 berth wharf was started, located about 1800 feet beyond the pierhead terminus of the new causeway and connected to it by an elevated trestle capable of full scale truck traffic. It is expected that the south end will be ready for receipt of incoming cargo in January 1946 and that all construction will be complete for full opera tion about March, 1946. With the completion of these facilities and the new loading pumps at Sitra, it should be possible to finish any bulk oil shipment in 24 to 36 hours. (j) Camp Facilities . The.growing Company facilities and increased personnel have necessitated extensions to the Awali village. A new housing area has been laid out and six new two-bedroom and eleven new three-bedroom air cooled houses have been built and twenty two-bedroom houses are in the course of construction. A new sewage pump house was also constructed in this area. The Awali storehouse office was found to be inadequate and was extended during the year. (k) Personnel . The following gives a summary of the personnel employed by the Company on their regular operations and on additional construction work during the yean- (Continued)-13- m Americans British (U.K.) Canadians South Africans Other Europeans British Indians 1 Iraqis Bahrainis Others 261 (including 105 Contractors Employees). 292 82 28 8 681 20 3580 736 5688 (1) Royalties on Bapco Oil . During the half year period from the 1st January, 1945, to the 30th June, 1945, the Royalties paid to the Shaikh and the Bahrain Government amounted to Rs.15,65,925 (Rupees fifteen lacs, sixty-five thou sand nine hundred and twenty-five only). The statement for Royalties for the second half of the year under review had not been received at the time of compilation of this report. 20. VISITS OF FOREIGN NOTABLES . (i) Mr. Van der Meulen, Minister for the Netherlands, at Jedda, passed through Bahrain en froute to Bushire on the 7th January, and spent a couple of days here. (ii) His Excellency Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, spent almost two weeks in Bahrain during June. He’ stayed with His Highness. 21. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (i) On the 1st January in accordance with the usual custom His Highness accompanied by his senior relatives paid an official call on the political Agent. Later the same day some 200 of the leading members of all communities in Bahrain were received by the Political Agent. (ii) on the 16th February the Spring Race Meeting was held in aid of War Charities and resulted in a satisfactory collection of Rs.16,000/- to that end. (iii) As hour by hour publicity made V.E. DAY more obviously imminent, there were local attempts to 'jump the flag'; the anxiety to celebrate, coupled with the normal nervous tension of the Arab, could not wait for the official all-clear. When it did come there was inevitably a tinge of anti-climax in the picture. Nevertheless, flags during the day and lights at night made a brave show. The squibs were old and damp but their dulness served only as a reminder that material for making them was for use in sterner fireworks. (Continued)-14- Floodlights on the Agency did wonders of make-up for its diurnal face. The 9th, 10th and 14th May were public holidays. On the 14th May the poli tical Agent gave an Arab dinner for hIs Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, the heads of local British and American institutions and leading merchants. (iv) Celebrations for V.J. DAY on the 15th August came as somewhat of an anti-climax to that of V.E.DAY. Celebrations were reserved and the inevitable lassitude engendered by the month of Ramadhan undoubtedly played its part. r j (v) on the 21st December Haji Yousuf Ahmad Kanoo died at the age of 71. His association with His Majesty's Government started in 1898 in the time of the Agent Haji Ahmad bin Abdur Rasool. He continued to serve as Assistant until the arrival of Mr.Gasken in 1902, and was associated with Major Prideaux and Cap-ain Mackenzie until 1909. He received the Kaiser-i-Hind medal second class in 1911, the title of Khan Sahib in 1917 and the M.B.E. in 1919. In 1924 a C.I.E. was bestowed upon him. The death of this well known old Arab was marked in Bahrain by the closing of the Bazaars for one day. 22. THE WEATHFU. /of a Turkish bath Local repute has it that for ten years Bahrain !Aa ; :u : ^ weather of the severity experienced during the month of July of the year under review. For days and nights without intermission the steamy heat was intense, and there was no wind to relieve the atmo sphere/or ruffle the oily expanse of the sea. It was E e H 0d 5* at the electrical system in Bahrain struck for shorter hours of work and ceased to function for irregular and frequent periods. Some forty to fifty R.A.F. personnel had to be flown out of Bahrain as a result of heat exhaustion and S fT? re !,prlck1 ^ h ea t', a skin disease which in its mildest form produces nervous irritation and when severe can be acutely poisonous, and of which there were very many cases. No European or Indian during this period was free xrom it and many Arabs also were affected. 23. ECONOMIC . (i) Banking and Currency . With the cessation of hostilities both in the ^ the ? ast 4 durin g the year, there was a con siderable loosening in the regulations controlling trade and currency which gave both the merchants and a ^ OI * itie ? a chance once again to do business. ‘ Added to this was the opening of a second banking house • the Imperial Bank of Iran - towards the close of 1944. The rates offered by the banks to businessmen had now to be on a competitive basis. Demands for exchange were (Continued)-15- more than doubled and increased towards the close of the year. Exchange on India in particular was in great demand during the last three months of the year. ' (ii) Eastern Bank . The transactions of the Eastern Bank were concerned chiefly in financing the requirements of the oil companies operating in this area,, and the Navy, Army and Air Force Services. Their imports in currency notes amounted to Rs.119 lacs and sales on India amounted to Rs.70,94,392. During the year they received 583 bills for collection chiefly from England, India, south Africa and the United States of America with a total value amounting to £.98,691. The chief goods imported through the bank from England were cigarettes, piecegoods, hosiery, bicycles, vvoollen material, hats, photographic material, stationery, medicines and machinery; and from South Africa, tinned provisions, and canned fruits. (iii) Imperial Bank of Iran . The year 1945 was the first year of the Imperial Bank»s working in Bahrain, and its activities showed a steady increase throughout the year. The total held in current accounts increased to Rs.31,00,000 on the 31st December, 1945, from Rs.5,00,000 on 31.12.1944. The Bank’s total operations in foreign exchange were:- Purchases Rs.103 lacs. Sales Rs.56 lacs. Their imports in currency notes and coin amounted to Rs.56,15,000 during the year. Credits were opened to cover imports into Bahrain to the extent of Rs.375,000. The total value of bills received for collection amounted to Rs.850,000. During December of the year under review the bank made an agreement to purchase a site for a °^ ce ‘ J his site ls situated on Prior Road between th ! Messrs - Gray Mackenzie and Company, Limited, and the Arabian American Oil Company. 24 ' CABLE &amp; WIRELESS LIMITED . The staff of this branch number 43, of whom live are European and the rest Indian. Their services were adequately maintained throughout the year, continuous watch for shipping and aircraft being kept, in addition to their telegraphic activities, both Commercial and Service. During the year an agreement was reached between the Bahrain Government and cable &amp; Wireless Limited for the installation and operation by the (Continued)latter of an automatic telephone system in Bahrain. Plans to this end showed no progress by the close of the year. BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION . The anticipated stepping up of frequency of services to serve the Far Eastern theatre of war developed for the first half of the year. Due to the sue.den collapse of hostilities with Japan it was evid towards the latter halft df 1945 that the frequency of services would tend to decline, especially in regard to the R.A.F. Flying Boat Refers Programme which was planned by and for whose handling the Corporation was responsible. the year*- h6 following is a table of statistics for In the first half of the year the greater portion of the passengers was Service personnel - tra embarKing and disembarking.

War time conditions and their aftermath during 1945 again prevented the Petroleum Concessions Limited from obtaining personnel and equipment with which to carry out geological exploration or drilling in the concession areas in the Persian Gulf. Towards the end of the year, however, it became possible to make some preparations towards geological exploration in the Trucial Coast and hinterland, and for resumption of drilling in Qatar early in 1946. With the end of the war with Germany and Japan, the Ruler of Qatar showed a revival of interest in the re-opening of the Qatar Field. He again drew attention to the oil developments in the territories of his neighbours, Bahrain and Arabia, and he is not easily persuaded that every effort is being made to recommence drilling and expedite production. On the 20th March, 1945, an oil concession agreement was concluded with the Ruler of Umm-al-Qaiwain on terras which compare with the other concessions on the Trucial Coast. Towards the end of the year the Company were in correspondence with this Agency on the subject of the use of Company Aircraft in the Persian Gulf and Muscat territory. Approval has also been obtained to the construction of a Company Landing ground in Qatar. 27. THE ROYAL AIR FORCE . Early in the year under review Air Commodore Oliver accompanied by rather more than 20 expeits made a survey of the new R.A.F. commitments on Muharraq Island and informed the political Agent that the per sonnel of the R.A.F. would be increased by a further 600 men during the summer. The progress with the laying of pierced steel sheeting, alongside the runways has been satisfactory. Later a firm of Palestinian contractors commenced work on the laying of pierced steel sheeting on a bitumen and sand foundation on the main runways themselves, and making other improve ments. (Continued)-18- 28. AMERICAN CONSULATE . Mr. Parker T. Hart and Mr. Clarence McIntosh were U.S. Vice-Consuls at Dhahran at the beginning of the year under review. In May Mr. Parker T. Hart left for the ' United States on leave and was succeeded in turn by Mr. William L. Sands and Mr. Walter W. Birge, Jr. In December Mr. Parker r. Hart returned to Dhahran. Mr. Clarence McIntosh was Vice-Consul until the end of the year. The State Department has attached growing importance to their consular post at Dhahran. In January Oman (Muscat), Qatar, and the Trucial Coast were informally included within the district of ' Dhahran Consulate and in December Mr. Parker T. Hart returned to Dhahran as the United States Consul. A close and friendly liaison was main tained between this Agency and the Dhahran Consulate in all matters of common interest. In January Mr. Parker T. Hart accompanied Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E.? O.3.E., the Political Agent, Bahrain, on a tour of the Trucial Coast. In June and July r.ir. illiam L. sands attended as a spectator at the trial of an American employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who was sentenced to one year’s simple imprisonment by the Agency Courts./ fl* -19- 29 . QATAR . QATAR . 29. (i) The Ruler of Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Abdulla bin Qasim al-Thani, C.I.E., is now about 74 years old, and continues in good health despite a few sec-backs such as an attack of impetigo of the feet. He was treated for this by the Agency Medical Olficer who went to Qatar in late November to attend to him. His age prevents him from carrying out efficiently all affairs of State most of which are now done by his second son and heir-presumptive, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdulla, who is now 40 years old. The latter, of whom the father is very fond, is the keeper of the official seal and issues all letters in his father’s name. (ii) Local Affairs . ^ _ Sheikh Hamad goes down to Doha, the Capital of Qatar, daily to attend to affairs of State and also sries important cases. Petty and minor cases are dealt with according to Islamic Law by the Amir of Doha, one Hammam by name, an old and trusty follower of the Shaikh. (iii) Revenue . The chief source of revenue for the Shaikh accrues from the subsidy on oil given by Petroleum Concessions (Qatar) Limited, Other sources of revenue are Cuscoms duty at 7% on imports and exports of barley a v/heat and 5^ duty and 2$ demurrage tax on all other goods. (iv) Education . Education is confined to boys, there being about eight small schools with a total number of 300. ^ They are taught the Koran, simple arithmetic and the Arabic script. No schools for girls have as yet been opened. (v) Pearling Industry . The pearling fleet consists of about 70 craft with a total crew of about 1,500 persons, most ox whom come from the hinterland and Persia during the pearling season. During the year under review the catch was small but due to the high price prevail ing for pearls the margin of profit was most encouraging. (vi) Shipping . No steamers call at Doha, the port of Qatar. The 'Khuziztan' of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,^Limited, periodically calls there to replenish Qatar’s supply of an ? S e ^ ro1 * Traffic between Qatar and ports outside is carried by dhows. ut, (Continued)-20- (vii) Official Visits. The Political Agents visited Qatar twice daring the year. The first visit was by Mr. C.J.PELLY, O.B.h., I.C.Q,, during April in the P.C.L. launch 'GHAZAL' and the second in November by Lieutenant- Colonel A.C. GALLOWAY, O.B.E., accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, in H.M.5 'SEABELLE'. (viii) Health . There are no doctors or medical facilities in Qa^ar. Sanitation is most primitive and as a result the health of the community is not of a high order. Malaria is most insidious. Fairly prevalent too are dysentery, syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis. &amp;nall- pox appears from time to time. Dr. Steele, the Agency ^eciical Officer, paid a visit to Qatar at the request ox the GheiAh late in November. As news spread of the arrival of the Medical Officer people streamed in from the country-side to be treated. After 4 days the doctor returned, his supply of drugs having given out.

Theft was rendered com paratively easy on account of the very inadequate security arangements in the camp. In October, however, the camp was partially fenced with barbed y dr f, r; nd Levy guards were, with the approval of the Lhaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai, ordered to open fire ° n ^ an u p ? r ?? n found in or around the camp at night manner 0 t0 halt When ^allenged in the proper manner.

F y - LX v ®nicies by (Continued)-24- ( (. / (h) LOCAL AFFAIRS . (i) In February a merchant named Roopchand Permanand of Tatta (Sind) was murdered in Abu Dhabi. He was the only British Indian subject in that place and had settled there many years ago. The murderer was caught, found guilty, and was executed oy shooting. (ii) On the 6th March the Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., political Residenu in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Major T. Hickinbotnam,. C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah by air. The next day the Hon’ble the Political Resident visited the village of Dhaid, some 40 miles from Sharjah, where he received the Shaikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Ajman, Sharjah, Dubai, Umm al Qaiwain, the Regent of Kalba, and the paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab tribe. The gathering w^s of considerable size and the Shaikhs were accompanied by many of their relatives and followers. The Hon*ble the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain, discussed various matters of interest with the Shaikhs and later invited them and their followers to lunch. After the lunch the Hon«ble the political Resident addressed the gathering and then returned to Sharjah. It is interesting to note that all the Rulers of Trucial Oman were present at this gathering with the exception of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who was absent owing to the distance of his State from the rendezvous. The greatest amiability prevailed during the gathering and the Shaikhs appeared to be on very cordial tenas with each other though, with one exception, they all appeared, as is customary, armed to the teeth. The exception was the most warlike of them all, Shaikh 'mhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, the Paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab, who, out of courtesy to the Resident, arrived with his followers unarmed. (iil) On the night of the 17th October, Shaikh Rashid, son of the Shaikh of Dubai, occupied Khor Ghanadhah with about 300 armed men. They took with them large quantities of building materials and showed every intention of building a fort there. In 1937 a settlement of the boundary between Dubai and Abu Dhabi was attempted and Ghanadhah was then not included in Dubai’s claim. This move then amounted to an aggression against Abu Dhabi, and moreover as many of the armed men were transported by sea it also constituted a breach of the treaty of 1853 with His Majesty’s Government which forbade aggression by sea. The Assistant political Agent, Bahrain, left on the 21st October for the Trucial Coast to investigate and reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was preparing to meet force with force, and that hostilities between Dubai and Abu Dhabi appeared to be imminent. The political Agenu, Bahrain, acting on the instructions of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf demanded the withdrawal of all Dubai’s forces from the Khor. This (Continued)-25- This demand was complied with on the 29th October. At the same time a promise was extracted from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi that he would not take any retaliatory action. (iv) Khalifah bin Zayid died peacefully at Buraimi at the reputed age of 108 years. He was the uncle of Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayid, the present Ruler of Abu Dhabi. He played a pro- a ^ a ^ rs Abu Dhabi and was £&gt;haiKh Shakhbut's chief adviser and confidant. H.B.M.’s Political Agent Bahrain. IfS U11, . s,4 ^ Z I'l qt, ( W* P P . ku&gt;-z .

( Please see^ S.Nos.23 and 37) If approved we may leave out actual figures for these from our^ report. There is a - discrepancy in last year's report in the section on the eastern Bank ( p.13 of report). The figure for the import of currency into Bahrain is give' as Rs.168,50,000/- instead of only Rs.33,50,000/-. It gives the lie to our statements made this year of improved banKing and business. However, it is hardly likely that it v/ill be noticed. May let the matter rest as it is? Pd. ? r, (P&lt;r&lt; J .
