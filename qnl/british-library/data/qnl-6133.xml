The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different States This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3 The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided tnat the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5 At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide :— (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States.

TheLegal Advisers consider that the mistake is an obvious misprint which can be treated as such, the paragraph being read as if the word ‘’Kuwait 1 * appeared for ’’Trucial States”. In their view an Amending Order merely to make a correction is unnecessary unless the error causes any practical diffic ulty. On the other hand the matter should be put right as soon as an appropriate opportunity offers and if a number of other errors of a substantial nature come to light an Amending Order might become desirable.

I EXPLANATORY NOTE (ThisNote is not pan of the Order, but is intended to indicate ^ Us general purport.) 1 This Order-in-Council relating to Bahrein should be read with the Orders relating to Kuwait, Qatar, Muscat and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2 In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His Maiestv exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent varies slightly in the different States. Thts junstoto has been exercised under Order-in-Council ma A de for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3 The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State oi g roil P ° States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Residerit in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the Superior Court in each State or group of States. 4 Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers undlr these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied m these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the 26Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide: —■ (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident; (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States. 27 (393S) fN. 94 ) 4/49 D.L.Jt ■ // -~Z STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS 1949 No. 592 FOREIGN JURISDICTION .

This Order-in-Council relating to Muscat should be read with the Orders relating to Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His Majesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. .The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the Superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide: — (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States.

Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and, similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide: — (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as Assistant Judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States.

EXPLANATORY NOTE (This Note is not part of the Order, but is intended to indicate its general purport) 1. This Order-in-Council relating to Qatar should be read with the Orders relating to Bahrein, Kuwait, Muscat and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His Majesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide :— (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States. 25 (3370) (N. 96) 4/49 D.L.• % STATUTORY INSTRUME NTS 1949 No. 595 FOREIGN JURISDICTION QATAR The Qatar Order in Council, 1949 % i LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE To be purchased directly from H.M.

G.No Jackson, Esq., M.B.E., Political Agent, KUWAIT.BiilTISH LEGATION, 133/8/49. BEIRUT. 11th July, 1949. Dear Residency, Please refer to your letter 85/42/49 of May 17th about jurisdiction in Kuwait over foreigners who are not nationals of a Muslim State. The Lebannon cannot be considered a Muslim State. There is no State religion and no religious community has an absolute majority over the others. The national life of the country is organised on a rough approximation to the size of each of the religious communities thus, the President is a Maronite, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the President of the UEamber of deputies is a Shia Muslim and the remaining members of the Cabinet consist- of two Maronites, one Sunni, one Shia, one Greek Orthodox, one Greek Catholic, and one Druze. We enclose a list giving the approximate numbers of each of the main religious sects.

Indeed, the Sheich of Bahrain whose forebears lost jurisdiction over them-in 1920 is now, I believe, trying to get it back again, and in view of the contents, of para 2 of India Office letter N.o. P.Z.7185/35 of the 14th October, 1935, it is difficult to sbe how we can strongly oppose his wishes. The Sheikh of Cuwait, too is very jealous of his jurisdiction oVer Moslem foreigners in Kuwait and is most unlikely willingly to forego it over subjects of the Persian Oulf States, the more so as Bahrain is litelv to regain it. over subjects of these States when they are in Kuwait.

For different reasons I am not in favour of splitting jurisdiction because it would be impossible to decide, for instance, who had jurisdiction over a cornoration registered in the Lebanon in which there were both Muslim and non-Muslim directors. My letter v o.C/231 of the 17th September, 1949, refers.* The ouestion, for instance, of jurisdiction over Middle East Airlines - a Lebanese concern - would cron up when the King’s Regulation and parallel Kuwait legis lation now under consideration to apply the new Air Navigation Regulations comes to be administered. • 4.

Please refer to King’s Regulation No. 1 of 1947 (The Kuwait Passport Regulation, 1947). 2 . Cases have occurred of European British subjects formerly^employed by British firms here who were given visas .or Kuwait at tho request of their former employers and who have since resigned or been dismissed from their employment anc. have remained in or returned to Kuwait either in business on their own account or as employees of other firms. The validity of their visas has since expired or will shortly do so. One of these persons is a person to whom, now that I aXcw him, 1 would not give a new visa for Kuwait or extend hir present one. 3. Also, according to the Summary Visa Regulations British subjects ray be given visas for Kuwait without reference to us; and a case has come to my notice of a v-sa being given to one who would not have been given a visa had a reference been made to me and had the true nature of his business here been disclosed. 4. Accord:rg to tne Kuwait Posspoit Regulation it is an offence to enter Kuwait without a valid visa: but it does uet a peer to be an offence to remain here without one. As tne Fegulation stands it appears that nothing less than proceedings under e^ticTe ?5 or 26 of the Kuwait Order in Council are required to get them out of Kuveit if, for any reason, it is considered desirable to do sc. Proceedings under these sections are not always practicable or possible, either because there is not. sufficient evidence against them or because the objections to their remaining here are not sufficiently serious to warrant deportation proceedings, especially in view of the instructions in para 3 of Foreign Office telegram No.105 of the 2nd March, 1949. - , • , , ^ S, 6o ^ *2/(1 6. We are, however, at our discretion allowed to withhold visas without giving reasons from persons wishing to come here. What is required is a provision in the Passport Regulation to extend the exercise of this dis cretion to the renewal of visas uersons who have got here and have proved to be undesirable; and I recommend that the Passport Regulation be amended in this sense. Such persons could then be prosecuted for a b^^ch of the Regulation on expiry of their visas. It would almost certainly be sufficient to esuse them to leave if they were told that they cculd be and would be prosecuted. A draft of a new King’s Regulation is enclosed for your considera tion. 6. If the objections to their presence here were so serious that air immediate removal was necessary before the expiry of their visas, then proceedings under Articles 25 and 26 of the Order in Council would probably be prac ticable. ki.

We have to thank you for your letter f No. 188(7/1) dated the 18th ultimo the contentsThe Political Agency, Kuwait No. 0/255(6/10) 19th October, 1949 Dear Sir Rupert, Now that the new Civil Air Agreement has been signed it will be necessary to apply the revised Air Navigation Regulations to persons subject to our jurisdiction by a King’s Regulation issued under Article 85 of the Kuwait Order in Council. The former King’s Regulation -No.l of 1936- applied Air Navigation Rules made by the Sheish. According to our new agreement Kuwait is to be regarded for the purposes j &lt;£ Cf j k\ of international civil aviation as United Kingdom : ^fd Regulations and Conditions contained in the two Annexes attached to the Heads of Agreement have been incorporated in the body of the King’s Regulation. These two annexes were sent out by the Foreign Office with their letter No. 68 (W 7389/3/802) dated 17th ^ LU December, 1948 to you and it appears from paragraph 3 of that letter that they have been examined in London and brought into line with modern requirements. 2. The definition of 'authorised person'’ contained in Article 15(a) of Annex 1 read with Articles 1(1) and 2 of the Heads of Agreement appears to me to mean that the Quarantine Medical Officer should carry out the Air Sanitary formalities, that the Sheish’s customs and passports officials are to implement the customs and territory; and this change is reflected in the consideration. It is self-contained in that the r H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., C3I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. passports/ • • • •passports regulations, and that the supervision necessary to give effect to the Air Navigation Regulations is intended to be carried out by His Majesty’s (rovernment T s agents and their employees. Section 16 of the icing’s Regulation is intended to make this clear. 3 # A penalty clause (section 17) for unauthorised landings has also been included to be collected as an extraordinary landing fee without the necessity for legal proceedings, unless the pilots of the offending aircraft of the local agents of the airlines refuse to pay it. You might lixe to consider whether a penal landing fee of Rs.100/- is reasonable or excessive. Paragraph 3 of your letter No. S6/133/49 of the 9th July to the Foreign Office pass parallel legislation applying these rules to Kuwait subjects and to corporations that I thinK will have to be regarded as Kuwait subjects when in Kuwait -my letter East Airlines, Iranian Airways, Iraqi Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Misr Airways and la Gampagnie General de Transport, for instance, come into this category; and, should it be necessary for His Majesty’s Government’s agents in charge of the aerodrome to prosecute them for breaches of the Air Navigation Regulations they would, I thinl:, have to do so in accordance with Part 71 of the Kuwait Order in Council unless of course they prosecuted the companies’ pilots -most of whom are British subjects or Foreigners- in their personal capacity. I have spoken to His Highness and he would have no objection to passing parallel legislation. refers It will be necessary to ask His Highness to No. 0/331 of the 17th ^Sept September, 1949, refers.

CON FT,T 7 A. i | The Political Agency, Bahrain, November 7, 1949. rs, ti/1/No. R-486-29/10 Political Agency, Bahrain, November 7, 1949 Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to Jackson’s letter of 24th September forwarded to this Agency under Residency letter No.85/68/49 of 6th October. 2 W Since that time I have received a letter from Belgrave raising this same subject of the control of immigrants. I enclose a copy of* that letter. 3. I consider that we are under an obligation to give all assistance in controlling people who enter Bahrain (and this would presumably apply equally to Kuwait). As I mentioned to you in the Residency Jackson’s suggestion regarding visas will not work because a visa is only a permit to enter. I have discussed furthermore the Bahrain Government’s proposals with Belgrave and in agreement with him I suggest that the following steps should be taken. 4. In place of the suggestions contained in paragraph 4 of Belgrave’s letter I would suggest that the issue of a residence permit would cover both (b) and (c). This permit would be valid for a year and subject to re newal; in the case of employees of firms whobrought them into the island^wider a guarantee the permit would be marked as valid'only so long as they are employed by (name of firm)? Belg^ave agreed that the proposed 15 days grace was too short §nd that visitors should be allowed to stay here for a month before requiring a residence permit. 5. As regards paragraph 4(a) of Belgrave's letter, Belgrave admitted that the term ’exit permit' v/as misplaced; there was no idea of giving permission to leave the island or withholding it. He merely meant that the passports of people leaving Bahrain should be seen and stamped by the Passport Officials in the same way as they are seen and stamped when people enter the inland. This is normal in almost every country. 6. As regards paragraph 5 of Belgrave’s letter, it seems only reasonable that there should be some control, as there is in other countries. 7 r In so far as this would fit in with the Order in Council it appears to me that the administration of the system would have to remain with the Bahrain authorities (as are such matters as Customs, passport control, and driving licences) but that we might insert a proviso that no permit should be refused to anybody coming under the Order-in-Council except with the approval of the Bolitical Agent, who would in his turn instruct the Bahrain Government to refuse one if he wished. 8. It is worth noting that in paragraph 3 Belgrave states that in Kuwait it is necessary to apply for a residence permit after 15 days stay. I do not understand how this fits in with Jackson's letter, but Belgrave -- 2 - was very definite about it. I am sending a copy of this letter to Kuwait and should be glad if they would send their comments on this point both to you and to us. Yours sincerely, J.A.F.

Dalrympl® Belgrave, Bsquire, , Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To His Britannic Majesty^ political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sulman has instructed me to write to you once again drawing your attention to the question of control over persons from India, Pakistan and Middle Bast States who enter and leave his country. This matter has been the subject of intermittent correspondence over several years. In 1942 it was suggested in my letter No.1905-15 of 1363 dated 10th October 1944 that passports of people leaving Bahrain should be inspected by the passport Officer. The suggestion was not approved by the Political Agent who considered that it was sufficient if passports were checked by the Shipping Agents or by B.O.A.C. before tickets were issued. Such a check would only apply to passengers leaving by steamers or by aircraft; there are many other ways in which people can and do leave Bahrain. In 1948 the Bahrain Government proposed that all non Bahrain subjects / not in possession of regular passports y living in Bahrain^should be Issued with identity cards.No further progress has been made in dealing with this suggestion. 2. During the year 1368, which ended on 22nd October, 6284 non Bahrain subjects entered Bahrain. This number does not include Bueopeans and Americans. Among them were 1505 Indians, 1091 Pakistanis, 1769 Trucial Coast Arabs, 970 Mustatis, 736 Qataris and 129 Portuguese subjects. The Government has no means of knowing how many of these persons have settled in Bahrain. On ar*ival their passports and travel papers are checked and their names and passport details are recorded but unless they leave Bahrain by steamer or by air nothing further is known about them. It is however evident to all that the population of Manama is rapidly becoming pre-eminently foreign. Quarters of the bazaar have now been entirely taken over by Indians. 3. It is essential that the Government should be £ aquainted with the wherabouts and the activities of subjects of neighbouring countries who enter Bahrain. In Kuwait and elsewhere permission is granted to people entering the country to stay in it for 15 days; after this period, if they wish to remain, they must apply to the Government for permission to reside in the country, under taking to respect and obey the laws of the country and providing a sponsor, resident in the country, who undertakes some degree of responsibility for their good behaviour during the period of their stay. 4. The Bahrain Government wishes to make orders on the following matters (a) Passports of persons of all nationalities must be stamped by the Passport Officer with an Exit Permit before the holders of the passports leave Bahrain.- 3 - (b) All persons other than Bahrain subjects who remain in Bahrain for more than 13 days must be in possession of identity cards which will be issued to them by the Bahrain Government&gt; unless they are already in possession of book passports, (c) All persons of any nationality desiring to reside in Bahrain should apply to the Bahrain Government for permission to reside in the country giving details of their proposed occupation etc. 4T. In connection with (e) I would point out that at present there is no order prohibiting any person of any nationality from setting up any kind of business without first obtaining permission from the Government to do so. In fact persons who are not Bahrain subjects usually ask His Highness’s permission before starting business but there is no law requiring them to do so. Recently it has come to the knowledge of the Government that two groups of foreigners now in Bahrain have under consideration the the opening of a dance hail aid a cafe with a w floor show'. 6. His Highness wishes to know whether you approve of his proposal to introduce the regulations referred to in para 4. I have the honour to be. Sir, lour most obedient servant, Adviser to the Governmentand it is contemplated that housing and other charges might be altered if the Kuwait Oil Company are appoin ted H.M.G’s agents - para 7 of enclosure B to S.46 in file 6/7 5 . vol,II. Also it has been proposed that a penal clause should be inserted in the Regulations to penalise unauthorized landings - para 3 in enclosure to s.47 file 6/7, vol.II. What is now required is a draft of a new Klngfe Regulation applying £nnex 1 of the New Civil Air Agreement plus any penalty clause the Resident might like to add, and embodying the scale of landing fees notified in enclosure to s.75, file 6/10. and the housing fees already fixed in P.2. 4126/34. If the housing fees are later revised we can issue a further '. King * s Regulation. The appendix in P.Z.4126/34 might also need amending to bring it into line with the terms of the new Air Agreement as modified By s,125 in file 6/10.
