Sir, With reference to your letter No .f .A .Divl .1(7 ) 0 -l 30/^l/o31 of the E7th August last on the above-mentioned subject, 1 ara directed to observe as follows:- Ahwaz Consulate Buildings. The agreement with the Foreign Office already reported to you providing for the final adjustment without further delay of the outstanding expenditure under this head, amounting to Bs.19,413* 4* 6,was made on the initiative of this Ofxice as the question of the disposal of the site and the materials appeared likely to remain unsettled for some time, fhe Secretary of State is of the opinion that it is unnecessary to await the settlement of this question as the financial aspect thereof can conveniently be dealt with independently. On the assumption that this will be concurred in, I am to ask in which statement the final adjustment of the sum of Rs.19,413. 4. 6 will appear. On the same ground the expenditure on the custody of the materials at the site may be similarly brought to account. In view of the smallness of the amount involved, the prior concurrence oj. the Foreign Office is considered unnecessary. Persian Legation — Loss by exchange• It is inferred from your remarks that the transactions giving rise to this loss related not merely to the Legation but to other posts for which the Government of India are responsible, despite the appearance in the statement for the year ox minor sums under the same head in other instances. I am to ask that you/ The Accountant-General, Central Revenues, Imperial Secretariat Buildings, New Delhi.you will confirm this before your explanation is transmitted to the Foreign Office and also illustrate how circumstances involved the change from a credit in 1927-£8 of Rs.23,776/- to a debit of Rs.32,229/- in 1928-29. I take this opportunity of informing you with reference to your letter Ho ,T .A.-Divl .1 (4) of 30-31/456 of the 28th July last that the Foreign Office has accepted a claim f or a moiety of the sum of £1,027. 8. 5 in respect ox arrears ox sterling overseas pay of officers serving in the Persian Gulf Division of the Public Works Department not included in the annual statements.

To His Majesty’s Under Secretary of State for India, Accountant General’s Department, India'Off ice , London, S.vv.l. Subject:- Expenditure on account of Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia etc. for the year 1928-29. Sir, With reference to the India Office letter No.A.G.390.3, dieted the 29th April 1931 on the subject indicated above, I have the honour to observe as follows:- (c) Ahwaz Consulate Buildings - The item of Rs .19,313/4/6 is still outstanding under ’’Miscellaneous Public Works Advances” in the Indian Accounts as the decision of the Foreign Office as to whether it will take over the unfinished buildings and the materials at site for the construction of a consulate of smaller dimensions is still awaited. On receipt of this decision, the whole amount of Bs .19,313/4/6 will be finally adjusted and included in the statement of expenditure incurred by the Government of India on Diplomatic and Consular Services m Persia. as regards the rent for the store godown for the custody of the unused materials at the site of the work, it is fixed in Krans and as the official rate of exchange for conversion of Krans into Rupees is variable it is not possible to state exactly its rupee equivalent which is payable every month. At the present rate of exchange the rent is about■ -^rwr-w (d) Leave passage contributions - In this connection a reference is invited to this Office endorsement L T o .0 .l-main/27-31/40^5, dated the 21st July 1931 from which it will he seen that the question raised by the India Office has been referred to the Government of India for decision. A further communication on the subject will be made to the India Office on receipt of orders from the Government of India. Para 2 of the Foreign Office letter No .2639/291/234, dated the 30th March 1931 forming an enclosure to the India Office letter, under reply - Rs.32,229 - ’Loss by exchange’ - This loss was the result of the fluctuations in the quarterly rates of - exchange between Krans and Rupees and of the conversion of the large transactions in Persia and theii^ adjustment in the accounts. Bushire Civil Works - A reference is invited onihis point to this office letter No.TA-Bivl.1 (5) of 30-31/155, dated the 14th May 1931 in which the India Office was requested to omit a sum of Rs.17,449 representing Capital expenditure from the statements for 1928-29. Accordingly the figure under this head will amount to Rs .35,095 only (Rs.52,544 - 17,449). The question of excess in the expenditure of 1928-29 will not therefore arise. Lingah-Assistant Surgeon - Rs.3,850 — The matter is being referred to the Government of India under whose orders the expenditure in question was treated as divisible between the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. A further communication will be made to the India Oftice as soon as a reply is received. Bander/Bander-Abbas - Repairs to Steam Launch - The expenditure in question was met from the Contract grant for the maintenance of the Steam Launch of the Consulate . Under the existing system of contract grants prevailing in the Consulates and Agencies in Persia and the Persian Gulf, the details of the charges met from the Steam Launch grant are left entirely to the discretion of the Consular Officer, subject only to the condition that the expenditure in each case should be sanctioned by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It appears that the expenditure in question was incurred with the approval of the Hon'ble the Political Resident. It was not, therefore, considered necessary to obtain the prior sanction of the Secretary of State for India or of the Foreign Office in this case . Kerman - Para 6 of the F.O., letter under reference - The point regarding special repairs to the newly purchasal building has been referred to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul Kerman and the India Office will be informed of the result on receipt of a reply from that officer. As regards the expenditur on garden contingencies it appears that the item, though incidental to the purchase of the building, is purely a maintenance charge and accordingly it is properly divisible in moieties between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. As regards para 7 of the Foreign Office letter under reference, I would state that all claims on account of capital expenditure included in the statements of Divisible expendituie for 1927-28 and 192'8-29 have since been withdrawn - vide this Office letter Ho♦TA-Divl.1(5) of 30-31/819, dated the 28th November 1930 and T .A.Divl,l(5 ) of 30—ML/155, dated the 14th May 1931, with the exception of the item regarding special repairs t the Kerman Consulate building, referred to in the preceding paragraph, the correct incidence of which is under discussion.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to the India Office letter No.A.G.4600, dated the 30th April 1930 regarding the question of withdrawal of capital charges on civil works in Persia and the Persian Gulf, included in my statement of Divisible expenditure for 1927-28. 2. It has been ascertained from the Accountant-General, Bombay that the sum of Rs.49,714 shown under ”41 Civil Works” in the Bushire Residency includes a charge of Rs.13,739 on account of capital expenditure. It Is requested that necessary readjustment of this amount may be made in the India Office, if, of course, they are satisfied that similar charges are not included by the Foreign Office in their annual statements of claims against the Indian revenues. 3. With regard to the question raised in para.2 of the letter, I may point out that the procedure suggested therein can be followed only in cases in which writes-baok do not involve any account adjustment in my books. In cases, however, where such account adjustment is involved e.g. writes-back of items affecting Divisible Statements communicated to me through the Exchange Accounts of other Audit Offices, the existing procedure may be allowed to continue, to enable me to effect an agreement between the figures of my Divisible Statements and those in the relevant portion of my accounts. In the present case/case, however, the readj stment can be made in the manner suggested, as no account adjustment is involved in this connection. 4.

Divl.l.(l) of 29-30/498, dated the 11th July 1929, wherein it was stated 9 - ... that it was understood from the Accountant General, Bombay, that the expenditure under Civil Works in the annual statements included departmental percentage charges* On a careful * * ♦ . examination of the work charges of the Persian Gulf Division as intimated to me through the Annual Statements furnished by the Accountant General, Bombay, I have ascertained that the pay and allowances of the Executive Engineer, Persian Gulf Division which are separately charged for In the statements of the Accountant General Bombay for recovery of a moiety from the Foreign Office, are also Included in the Establishment charges on which a percentage is levied as charges for Establishment, Tools and Plant, otc.

The history of this tangled case is as i t follows. On 27 January, 1917, the Treasury | sanctioned expenditure of 6,000 tomans a month for a force of 200 infantry and 100 cavalry (P. 469/17), but subsequently H.M.G. decided that this scheme should be postponed for the present (telegram to Tehran of | 30 May, 1917 - P. 2040). Apparently the Treasury was not informed of the postponement. On 27 July, 1918, the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, proposed that a force of 1500 should be maintained by the Ilkhani, and that we should be prepared to pay from 8-10,000 tomans a month till such time as the force could, having regard to the situation in Persia, be safely disbanded (P. 3274/18). This proposal was approved by a meeting of the Eastern Committee on 13 August, 1918, and on 14 August the F.O. telegraphed to Tehran, informing Sir C. Marling accordingly (P. 3632/18). ^ - On 23 September, 1918, the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, recommended that, on account of the increase in prices, an expenditure of 16,000 tomans a month should I _ be sanctioned to maintain a force of 500 mounted men (P. 4200/18). It was this scheme which the Treasury, in their letter of 14 1 December, 1918, refused to sanction; they did not mention the previous scheme, estimated to cost 8-10,000 tomans, because they had not been informed of it; but at the same time they stated that their sanction^to the original scheme ^which had oeen postponed) for an expenditure of 6,000 tomans was to be regarded as lapsing at the end of 1918. The t c/ Minister at Tehran was informed by the F.O. on 24 December of the Treasury decision in a telegram which followed the exact wording of the Treasury letter, wioh all its misapprehensions (evidently a mistake on the part of the F.O.) - P. 5803/18. Subsequently the Treasury, in a letter of 23 April, 1920, accepted half the expenditure incurred up to the end of January 1919, as it appeared that the F.O. telegram to Tehran of 14 August, 1918, had been regarded by the Minister as an authority to proceed with the scheme as subsequently modified (P. 3548/20). This decision was in accordance with representations made by the 1.0. in our letter of 28 January, 1920 (P. 8323/19), in which we pointed out that the proposals of July 1918 had been sanctioned by the F.O. in their telegram of 14 August, 1918, whereas the Treasury's refusal to sanction the revised scheme was not received until January 1919, 'subsequent to which date no payments were made'. Upon our enquiring of the G. of I. under what authority payments were made during February and March, the G. of I. first stated that it was made by the Consul at Shiraz under a general authority, dated 19 March, 1915, for Secret Service expenditure/P. 7294/20) ; they then amended this statement and said that the payment was made by Ispahan and the amount was debited in the Shiraz Consular accounts (P. 7659/20); and subsequently they again corrected themselves and said that payments were made by the Bagdad Treasury at the request of the Consul-General, Ispahan, to the Imperial Bank of Persia, Shiraz (P. 1641/21). It subsequently transpired that the payments were not made at the request of the Consul-General, Ispahan, but on his/Minute Paper.

That letter withheld sanction to the whole expenditure of 16,000 tomans a month. It is true that the Treasury subsequently sanctioned the expenditure up to the end of January 1919, but the reason why they did so was that the expenditure (or most of it) had been incurred before their decision of December 1918 could be communicated to the authorities concerned. (Je communicated it to the G. of I. by a telegram of 30 December, which, havever, ended with an enquiry whether the G. of I. still considered the expenditure necessary, end whether, if so, they could suggest any further arguments in support of it). Consequently, it is not unreasonable that, while sharing the expenditure up to the end of j January, the Treasury should decline to share it for February and March, when their decision on the subject had been (or ought to have been) made known to all the authorities concerned.

Act, which depends on Section 20 of the Act? I suppose that if the actual legality of the payment from Indian revenues were challenged in the Legislative Assembly or elsewhere on the ground that it was not made ’’for the purposes of the government of India” as laid down in Section 20 (1) of the Act, it could be defended on the lines that the unauthorised payments for February and March 1919 were made by the authorities at Baghdad, who were at that time responsible to the G. of I., and that it may be accepted as a general principle that the cost of a mistake, if not charged to the officer who makes it, should be borne by the Govt, to whom he is responsible; in other words, the payment was made from Indian revenues in order that the G. of I. might condone a mistake made by one of their officers and this is covered by ’’purposes of the government of India”. As, however, the G. of I. in their letter of 21 Lay have not specifically adverted to the constitutional point, it does not seem necessary to refer to it in replying. lU*leJXm ' t'j, it. S&gt; I ant inclined to think that your statement of the general principle is a little too wide,but it is certainly correctto say that where an officer of the Government irregularly or by mistake spends Indian revenues on an object which is within the general purposes of the government of India a write-off of the sum expended,in condonation of the irregularity or mistake,is within the purposes of the government of India. All that the Auditor says is that it is equitable that B.M.G.in this country should bear half of the cost of the Levies in February and March 1919. Be does not say and I do not think that he could say that it would have been illegal for the Govt of India to agree to pay the whole cost of the Levies for those months,or that it is now illegal to write off the amount spent. I presume that what the Govt of India are afraid of is not a complaint that the expenditure of any money on the Levies was or is illegal but that they ought to have secured the consent of the Imperial Govt to bear half the cost either before or after the money was spent.

In regard to the Auditor's report which was enclosed with your letter, I am to suggest that the position has not been described therein with complete accuracy. The refusal of His Majesty’s Government to accept responsibility for this expenditure was based not on the absence of formal prior acceptance of the charge but on the considered opinion of His Majesty’s Government, which / was conveyed to the India Office in December 1918, that,as far as the interests of the Imperial Government were concerned the expenditure in maintaining the Bakhtiari sowars was no longer justified. 3 Under Secretary of State, India Office.

The Government of India fully concur in the view 7 taken in the India Office letter Ho, 5907/29, dated the 8th October 1929, that the cost ought to be shared by bis Majesty’s Government and would be glad if advantage could be taken of the Auditor’s comments to re-open the case with the Foreign Office, Unless this is done it is needless to point out that these comments are likely to attract attention of the Public Accounts Committee and the legislature and that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in this matter will place the Government of India in a very embarrassing position. i I - —- I have the honour to be, Sir , Your most obedient servant, Offg.

Expenditure in Persia. Miscellaneous (Receipts). 7. The cost of certain Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Persia is borne in equal shares by the Imperial and Indian Governments, the necessary financial adjustment being made between the Foreign Office and the India Office. For the most part the claims and counterclaims relate to the ordinary expenditure for staff, upkeep of buildings, &amp;c., but during the war, and in the years immediately following, extraordinary items were included, with regard to one of which a long drawn out dispute between the two Governments has culminated in the writing-off to Indian revenues of an amount of £5,904, which represents part of the expenditure incurred in raising and maintaining a force of tribesmen for police purposes in Persia from October 1918 to March 1919. I do not consider it advisable to give full details of the matter in this Report, but the salient fact is that the Imperial Government, who shared the cost from October 1918 to January 1919, have refused, after repeated appeals, to bear any part of the cost for February and March 1919 on the ground that the expenditure for that period was incurred without proper sanction. While this is admitted it must be pointed out that the circumstances were of exceptional difficulty, and that local officials of both Governments concurred in the decision to retain the force beyond January 1919. It therefore seems eqmtable that the Imperial Government, in keeping with the general practice regarding expenditure in that part of the Middle East, should have continued to bear their share of the expenditure for the two months in question, but owing to the fact that it was brought to account by the Indian authorities and in consequence the onus of recovery rested on the India Office, the Foreign Office, by mere refusal to refund the amount involved, have thrown the whole burden on Indian revenues. In view of the fact that although Indian interests were involved those of the Imperial Government were equal or possibty even predominant, 1 draw attention to this expenditure with reference to section 27 (5) of the Government of India x\ct, under which the Auditor is enjoined specially to note in his Report “ cases in which it appears to him that any money arising out of the revenues of India has been appropriated to purposes other than those to which they are applicable.” &gt; 4In any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ No ; A O82/582/O0O and address, i -890 tX,*) , mc&gt;/ to any person by name, but to- L &amp; O O “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Do advantage would be gained lay such an adjustment and it appears that the matter would be regularised moot satisfactorily by the complete withdrawal of the entries in the Indian , statements for 1921-22 and 1924-26, l.e. debits of Rs.676.7.- and Rs.11,416 respectively, and also of the credit of Be.143.13,8 in the statement for 1922-23.

As this opening balance was accounted for by this office under a Debt Head, it was not included in the statement of divisible expenditure for 1921-22, and only the actual receipts and expenditure pertaining to that year were included in that statement. Similarly on the transfer of the Ahwaz Sanitary Department to the Persian Deputy Governor at Ahwaz at the end of the year 1921-22, its closing departmental balance of Rs. 11,415/- remained outstanding as a civil departmental debit in/in the debt portion of the books of this Office# This balance was, however, written off by the Government of India as expenditure, during the year 1924-25 and was thus included in the statements of divisible expenditure for that year# ~ : I have etc. (Sd.) 3.

This advice e appears to have followed up a week later hy a elegram to Tehran (see page 6 of the document sent ome hy Sir Denys Bray with his letter of 29th August .928) reporting that matters relating to Ispahan brigandage were approaching a crises. loreover, as regards the 'decision' referred to hy the Foreign Office in paragraph 2 of their letter oi the L9th January 1928 it would seem from the document I nave referred to that what the Treasury said was that thev were unwilling to sanction any expenditure (? heyond January 1919) 'in the absence of the clearest necessity for the new force'. If the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, had to take action quickly, it is difficult to know what he could have done otherwise? ton 1 * 1 J X il ^ /if/fa-a. — »Minute Paper.

For this purpose the text does not give us any more assistance than the summary of those telegrams included in the papers which we had already received from India and transmitted to the F.0. We can certainly contend that the Consul- General was an officer under the supervision of H.M.G.; but the point at issue is whether the payments were authorised by such an officer. They were not authorised by the Consul-General.^ merely recommend ed that the subsidy should be continued / and we knew that already from the summary of the telegrams previously for the text of the telegrams in the hope that they received. It seems to me, therefore, that having asked might strengthen our ease, and finding on their receip that they do not do so, we had better let the matter drop as was proposed in the previous Aaiagraa drop as was propo (p.14X3/29)/ .(P.1413/29) (Compare Mr.Wakely T s note of 28 December on an even earlier submission - P.5034/28). It is accordingly submitted that the amount at issue (Rs.1,62,850) should be accepted as a charge upon Indian revenues. In case, however, it is considered that, as suggested by the Financial Secretary, we should continue the argument with the F.Q., a draft letter is attached for consideration. It does not appear that the issue of such a letter will serve any usej-ul purpose, but except for prolonging a useless controversy it would perhaps do no harm. It would be undesirable, however in writing to the F.O. to say anything to suggest a contradiction of their argument that the payments were not authorised by an officer under the direct supervis of H.M.G.; the most that we can plead is that they were ’advised 1 by an officer subordinate to H.M.G.

Referred to j 1) Financial Secretary, 2) Auditor, i'J2y. The re-arrangement of the form in which the claim on the Foreign Office in reepect of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia is presented has now been accepted hy that Department and the Treasury, vide Foreign Office letter of the 3rd April, ^.0.4778/29 below* I It will be seen from the Minute submitting the letter to the Foreign Office on the subject that it ! was decided not to introduce therein the question of the application of contributions under the Fundamental Rules for leave and non-effective charges raised by the Auditor, vide Flag B, as it appeared that the revised scale recently introduced would, if applied : retrospectively as was assumed to be the intention in this as in other instances, produce little or no difference in the long run as far as accounts already rendered were concerned* The question, however, is one of principle which I think should be brought to the | notice of the Government of India against future r-visions of these contributions and their application to j personnel whose emoluments are partly recoverable from the Imperial Government, but it seems desirable that a j lead should be given as regards present re- adjustment. Retrospective adjustment at the Fundamental | Rules rates as suggested by the Auditor would be I somewhat difficult to justify to the Foreign Office in view of the definite explanation of the actual j application of those rates given to that Department in the Political Department letter of the 11th September ! , 1925/1925 , P*2575/25. At the same time the Treasury could be relied upon, X think, to call for retrospective application of the recently introduced scale if this was not volunteered by this Office. In the circumstances the matter seems to resolve itself into one of dovetailing the two adjustments into one another. This means that where contributions have been levied at the C.S.R. rate of 5/l6ths further recovery to bring the rate up to the revised one, which is in the neighbourhood of 34^, see statement 'A', is necessary,while recoveries at 40^ require scaling down to 34$. In the absence of data it I is not possible to arrive at the definite effect of this combined adjustment, but it seeme, vide statement 1 attached, that a roughly counter-balancing result, showing a j | small overcharge,would be reached over the years 1922-23 to 1925-26 and that the overcharge would not be increased fi! unduly if this period were extended to include 1926-27, the last year for which the Indian statement has been received. On this assumption it is suggested that the revised scale introduced generally, as far as civil in personnel are concerned, from 1st March 1929, might operate in the Diplomatic and Consular accounts from 1st April 1927 and that the military officers* scale when determined, should also apply from that date. (For the purposes of the statement it has been assumed that the latter will be the same as for the I.C.S., as before).

Z. Sir Austen Chamberlain agrees that after a prior refusal the Treasury gave their sanction to the acceptance of the charge of a moiety of the Bakhtiari payments for the period ending in January 1919. Such acceptance was authorised, however, not on the ground that the scheme had been subsequently justified, but in view of the fact that authority for a similar project which had not been proceeded with had been given in 1917 and had not been withdrawn. Authority for continuance of the payments was, as the Secretary of State for India is aware, immediately withdrawn, and no information has been furnished to show that any officer under the direct supervision of His Majesty’s Government was responsible for authorising the payments for February and March 1919. 3 ~' Sir Austen Chamberlain regrets therefore that he is not aware of any new grounds upon whicn he could recommend/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.recommend to the Treasury a reversal of their decision not to share expenditure upon the continuance of a scheme from which His Majesty 1 s Grovernment had definitely withdrawn. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,hr. Y^.'ton . Mr. Wakely, ^ It seemed worth while (in connection with the Warren-Fisher Committee) to ask the Accountant-General to prepare a statement of the expenditure at present borne by- India in connection with the Persian Gulf. I attach copies /\ of the statement which has been drawn up, together with an explanatory memorandum by the Accountant-General. It will be seen that he arrives at a total annual expenditure by India of some £47,00 0, of which some £30,000 odd is incurred on the Persian side. This figure does not take account either of the cost of the despatch vessel in the Persian Gulf, which was estimated by Sir Denys Bray at about a lakh a year (the cost of hiring the “Patrick Stewart” is Rs.2,000 per diem), or of the expenditure on Naval ships provided for in the Army Estimates (coal, etc.). The addition of these two items and of the £12,000 a year borne permanently by India under the Welby settlement (which would presumably fall on Imperial revenues were India’s connection with the Gulf completely severed), would probably bring the total to more nearly £70,000. No account has been taken in this statement of places such as Ahwaz and Kirman, which are not, strictly speaking, Gulf stations. ^imu OFFICE, raitmiLL, i. 27th April, 1929, by daar Immy, I pmdeod t &gt; l^t you have a etate^erit showing.;: the present administrative arrange ;ent® in the Gulf.

Presumably, however, Non- effective &amp;c., and possibly Overseas Pay, charges are incurred on account of Muscat and Bahrein and these would swell the total* It is understood that figures relating to Ahw&amp;s are desired for record* In 1926-27 the combined/combined expenditure there amounted to approximately £5,000, to which should be added about £750 for Non- effective and leave charges. A moiety of these amounts has been borne by India. Ho account has been taten of the fact that as regards the Gulf stations in Persia, India bears a portion of the expenditure, i.e. that being incurred in 1900, permanently, as this is almost entirely offset by the corresponding Pofapign Office burden in respect of the rest of the Persian establishments, vide the reply of this Department to the reference on P.6227/28. As regards the expenditure on Naval ships, this Department is unable to furnish any information of use in the nresent connection. Sundry craims are received from the Admiralty in respect of supplies of fuel for these vessels but it is probable that other claims arise on this account which are settled by the Indian authorities. Similarly claims in respect of repairs to H.M.S.'Triad 11 , which are an Indian liability are received from time to time but it is obvious tnat the bulk of the expenditure on this account is incurred by India. It is stated in Political Department fil® 815/17(7) that the cost of hiring the 'Patrick Stewart is Rs.2,000 ner diem, which for a period of 50-oO days in the year, would amount to Rs .1,00,000-Rs.1,20,000. It is not known whether any charge is made for the use of Naval vessels by the Resident, apparently not, but in any case their use in lieu oi the 'Patro.ch Stewart” would reduce the above-mentioned amount.

I should be grateful, further, if you could give a figure for (1) expenditure on Naval ships provided for in r • '• 2 Army Estimates; (2) say whether you agree that expenditure on the despatch vessel in the Persian Gulf amounts to about a lakh a year (the Government of India presumably refer to the 'Patrick Stewart', and the special accommodation which has from time to time to be provided for the Resident, unless, indeed, a special charge is made when the Resident uses one of H.M. ships). f/(.

The reason for this is not apparent and the net figures have been used by this Department.combined expenditure there amounted to approximately £5,000, to which should he added about £750 for Non- effective and leave charges, A moiety of these amounts has been borne by India, No account has been taken of the fact that as regards the Gulf stations in Persia, India bears a portion of the expenditure, i.e. that being incurred in 1900, permanently, as this is almost entirely offset by the corresponding Foreign Office burden in respect of the rest of the Persian establishments, vide the reply of this Department to the reference on P.6227/28. As regards the expenditure on Naval ships, this Department is unaole to furnish any information of use in the present connection. Sundry claims are received from the Admiralty in respect of supplies of fuel for these vessels but it is probable that other claims arise on this account which are settled by the Indian authorities. Similarly claims in respect of repairs to H.M.S. 'Triad', which are an Indian liability, are received from time to time but it is obvious that the &lt; bulk of the expenditure on this account is incurred oy India. It is stated in Political Department file 815/17 (7) that the cost of Mring the 'Patrick Stewart' is Rs.2,0C0 per diem, which for a period of 50 - 60 days in the year, would amount to Rs. 1,00,000 - Rs. 1,20,000. It is not known whether any charge is made for the use of Naval vessels by the Resident, apparently not, but in any case their use in lieu of the 'Patrick Stewart would reduce the above-mentioned amount.

This latest letter from the Government of India is in reply to India Office letter Goncurrently, on the 8th November, a letter was jsent to the Foreign Office, and to this the Foreign Reference is also invited to the discussion on P.4329/27 leading up to the issue of the letters to India and the Foreign Office. The previous papers ! referred to in the Political Department minute of the 20th September are now attached once more with the relevant flags. on a re-examination of this corpus it . would appear that the prospects of obtaining any money from the Foreign Office and Treasury are refused to pay on three separate occasions, in 1920, s in 1927, and in 1928. There seems no reason to ;suppose that on the information now furnished they Major Dickson^ summary now before us gives the of the case as clearly as circumstances permit, but it adds little to the information already possessed. Generally speaking, paragraphs 1 and 2 (pp 1-4) are irrelevant to the present issue except of 500 Sowars was employed from October 1918 to January 1919 under the supposed authority of the lag 2 of the 10th November, 1927, P. 4339/27. lag I. Office replied on January 19th, 1928. (P.218/28). will not refuse again. But having asked for the Government of Indian explanation, we can hardly do less than put it to the Home Departments. t * as a background. Their gist is merely that a force A. Foreign Office and India uffice. The Foreign Office have« moiety of the expenditure up to have already accepted a moie the end of January. It is the period etf ^eoruary and March, dealt with in paragraphs S to 5. that is now at issue. Prom paragraphs S and 5 it is evident that n a w-sn nnmmiasionerin Baghdad who was responsible for spending the money, was perfectly well aware that the treasury would not bear half the cost. The Consul- General at Ispahan (the Government of India's uxxxcer) was also, apparently, aware of this. He said tnat the source from which the money was now to come was immaterial so long as it was forthcoming. The Civil commissioner accordingly cast round for some source of supply and hit upon the general authority contained in an old Government of India telegram regarding secret service expenditure which of course was not connected with this specific question at all. There is nothing, therefore, to set against the Foreign Office contention (see their letter of the 19th January at Flag Y) that the payments in question were made at the request of the Consul-General alter His Majesty^ Governments refusal to contribute had been announced. Moreover, Major Dickson 1 s note appears to invalidate the argument used in this Office letter of the 8th November 192ST (under Flag X) that the expenditure was incurred on the supposed authority of the Foreign Office telegram of the 14th August 1918 No.421. Thus it would seem that the new material now to hand rather weakens than strengthens our case. The telegrams etc., referred to in Major Dickson^ note are flagged in red ink on the files attached, and it will be seen that though the note is a good summary, it really does not adduce any new facts of substance of a favourable nature which were[inute Paper, Department. not recorded on our files. However,, we must apparently give the Government of India this final run for their money, and a short draft letter to the Foreign Office communicating the Government of Indian letter and enclosures is submitted.

Sir, As desired in your letter Ho.D*3548-N, dated the 16th January 1928, I have the honour to forward, herewith in the form of a commentary-note all the information I have been able to glean from the relevant Baghdad war files on the above subject. I have, etc., Sd/- H.R.P.DICKSOH, Major, for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Notes on the organising and financing of 500 Bakhtiari sowars during OcTo'ber 1918 to March 1919 . Acting Givil Commissioner in Mesopotamia at Baghdad (Lieut*-Colonel now Sir A.T*Wilson) in his telegram No*6193 dated the 2?th July, 1918, addressed to Foreign Department, and repeated to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and Consul-General at Ispahan, proposed with the concurrence of the local General Officer Gommanding-in-Chief that Governing I^khani of the Bakhtiari tribes, named Sardar Zafar, should be invited to maintain on a war footing a force of 1,500 picked men, a 1000 being mounted, under his command. To keep this force in the field the Civil Commissioner proposed to supply them with a certain number of rifles and ammunition and to pay Sardar Zafar 8,000 to 10,000 tomans a month till such time as this force could, having regard to the situation in Persia, be safely disbanded, ihio recommendation was the direct result of the previous years expedition against the Kuhgulus in which we were successful chiefly because of our policy of assisting with arms and ammunition the Bakhtiari Illkhani | who was in favour of British interests. The objects of maintaining, this force m Bakhtiari country were stated by the Civil Commissioner to be (1) to stabilise the situation in Ispahan which was likely j to/come periodically precarious unless some such2 ' ' such force was in the vicinity; (2) to maintain the authority of the Illkhani in Bakhtiari territory as this was the one effective means of protecting our oil fields and (3) to have this force as a nucleus which could be doubled or trebled in an emergency and could, if necessary, and under the leadership of the lllkhani advance much further afield than Bakhtiari limits, and which with the lllkhani at its head would be free of the common accusation that the British were attempting to acquire political or territorial influence in .bakhtiari country* In other words as pointed out by the Civil Commissioner in his subsequent telegram to foreign Department repeated to London and Tehran Ho.8577 dated the 10th October 1918, by this scheme we helped to maintain a friendly and effective lllkhani, Sardar Zafar, in office and so ultimately saved ourselves a greater but necessary expense of keeping a garrison to protect our oil fields, free the roads from systematic brigandage than rife in Persia, and generally maintain law and order, in addition as pointed out by Foreign Department, this scheme whilst being an economical form of protection actually gave the Bakhtiari tribesmen a stake in the protection of the oil fields and in the maintenance of law and order generally. 2. The proposal was approved by the Secretary of State for India in his telegram dated the 15th August 1918, and in a connected telegram Uo.6612 dated 14th August 1918 toto Tehran, the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs suggested that His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (Captain Peel) should concert with Dr. Young as to the best means of giving effect to the arrangements. Accordingly Peel proceeded to Ispahan and reported in his telegram of 20th September 1918, that owing to famine conditions in Bakhtiari prices had soared up, so that in place of the original scheme under which 1,500 men were to be employed at an estimated maximum cost of 10,000 tomans a month he was forced to recommend on financial grounds the employment of only 500 Bakhtiari sowars, who if they v/ere to be well equipped, would now cost 15,000 tomans monthly plus 1,000 tomans the pay of four headmen, making 16,000 tomans a month in all. This revised scheme was supported by the Civil Commissioner who in his telegram Ho.7920 dated the 23rd * September 1918, to London, India and Tehran stated that a force of less than 500 mounted men would not be of use. Immediately following his telegram of 20th September Vice Consul, Ahwaz telegraphed from Ispahan ¥- on 27th September 1918, that serious trouble was imminent in Bakhtiari due to the rising of certain of the Khans and the advent of false claimants to the Illkhani and Illbegiship who were collecting sowars and harbouring important hostile chiefs. Hey accordingly proposed to guarantee forthwith Sardar Zafar the existing Illkhani and our ally, the expenditure of the above mentioned 500 sowars for a period of three months.I The matter was then immediate and in the absence of specific sanction of His Majesty*3 Government but undoubtedly influenced by the fact that the policy underlying his scheme already had been approved by the Foreign Office in its 14 th? telegram of 12th August 1918, to Tehran, the Civil Commissioner felt himself compelled by the enormous interests at stake immediately (i.e. the same day) to sanction Consul, Ahwaz's proposal. As a result Vice Consul Abwaz made payments for the maintenance of this force of 500 Bakhtiari sowars to the Illkhani, Sardar Zafar, between October to January 1919. 3. It was not till the receipt of the Government of India telegram Ho.10-3 dated x the 4th January 1919, that the Civil Commissioner was definitely aware that the Treasury Office were unwilling to sanction the expenditure in absence of the M clearest necessity for the new force' on account of the improved situation i.e. the relief of Abadah. In his telegraphic reply * Ho.537 dated the 15th January 1919, the Civil Commissioner practically admitted that the situation had improved by agreeing to ifce the withdrawal of troops from the vicinity of the oi fields, but by doing this he strengthened his case and pointed out that if the troops were withdraws and the south Persia Rifles ceased, as was very probable, to be a factor on which we could reckon in the future to steady the situation from time to time in Ispahan, it was necessary in the intere sts of the^ oild f 1 e -^ . s »our trade on the Ahwaz-“I s P a i ian route and position at the latter place, for us to give effective support to the Illkhani on the proposed lines of the Bakhtiari levy force. 4. heanwhile the internal situation in Bakhtiari required careful watching. Jealousy between certain of the Khans and the Illkhani and lllbegi still existed and it is more than probable that it was the near presence of our force of 500 Bakhtiaris that prevented an actual clash between the rival parties. Further numerous reports that robberies on a large scale were being committed made it clear that systematic brigandage was still rife in VevLm and that the force of Bakhtiaris had not yet succeeded in clearing the country of Brigands which was one of the principTal duties for which they were organised. Indeed, the force was already in existence for 5-^ months when His Britannic Majesty 1 s Consul-General at ^ Ispahan wired as late as the 15th March 1919, statingXhat he agreed with Sardar Zafar who desired that the force should be continued to be subsidised for a further period oi two months and pointed out that failure to maintain these sowars would afiect British prestige and almost certainly result in the break-down of operations against the Brigands in which case we would most certain ly leave Ispahan in a worse plight than that from which we attempted to rescue ner.^X Consul General, Ispahan, was also of the opinion/lhat the source from which the money was now to come was immaterial “so long as itit wasyforthcondng ,, . From this the earnestness and urgency of his request can somewhat he appreciated without the further reference to his telegram of a week later to Tehran in which he clearly reported that matters relating to Ispahan brigandage were approaching a crisis. In the circumstances it follows that there was every necessity, - if we wished to guard our enormous interests in Bakhtiari country and uphold British prestige and consistency, - for us to continue to maintain the force- of 500 Bakhtiari sov/ars during the months of February and March 1919. 5. The Civil Commissioner had little doubt that in view of the India Office telegram dated the Mth August 1918, and connected telegram from the Foreign Office to Tehran dated the &gt;Eth August 1918, that the Treasury Office would (as they did eventually^ in the special circumstances eventually accord sanction to expenditure on thrs corps for the period October 1918 to January 1919, if not up to the end of the financial year i.e. March 1919. x t was, however, necessary in the light of the definite information received in January that the Treasury oft ice were unwilling to sanction expenditure to find some other authority under which the scheme could be financed at least up to the end of the financial year when it was horjed the Persian Government would take the sowars over. The fact that payments for the corps had been regarded from the first as special secret service expenditure, apparently led the Civil7 Civil Commissioner to consider the question of utilising the general authority covering expenditure of the kind contemplated which seemed to he contained in the Government of India telegram ho.327 D-S. dated the 19th i- karch 1915 to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In this connection, hov/ever, there is no trace of definite (orders having issued and the ultimate circumstances in which payments were made during the months of February and March 1919, therefore, still remain the same as were reported in our telegrams to the Foreign Department Ro.294 and 450 dated the 15th * February and 11th March 1921 respectively. /VC ^ r 1 /From Ho .S'. 7(1)-A/28 The foreign Secretary to the Government of India To The Under Secretaxy of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.W.l.

Does the Political Secretary consider it desirable that the practice of sending to India copies of correspondence regarding the claims on the Foreign Office should continue now that its issue has been taken over by this Department? It is proposed in any case to send to India a copy of the present letter when the Foreign Office reply is received. R.A.JANES. The Indian statements for 1926-27 will be transferred as requested, and steps will be taken to furnish you with the Foreign Office claim as soon as it is received. It seems desirable that India should continue toreceive copies of correspondence with the Foreign Office regarding these claims in order to complete % their records. It is suggested, however, unless you see/see any objection, that such copies should go direct from your Department instead of through the Political Department as heretofore.

For any observations on the attached draft letter to the Foreign Office regarding an error in the and Cyod±4 clahns for some years past and proposing a change in the form of rendering the accounts for Persia, (3d,) Sidney Turner.. I have no observations to make on the error, or on the proposed change in the form of account and the figures on which future accounts are to be based. With regard to the closure of the accounts for 1922-23 and 1923-24, there is another matter which may necessitate further adjustment. In the pension contribution statements attached to the annual statements of Indian expenditure since 1922-23, Indian Civil Service and Military officers have Keen divided, in conformity with an arrangement made in the case of officers on foreign service, vide Financial Department note on P.2575/25, two groups to whom different rates of contribution have been applied according as the officers concerned obtained their appointments before or after 2?th January 1922, the date on which the new rates were introduced. There would appear, however, to be no reason why this arrangement should be applied in the case of the Indian Officers of the PersianD.&amp;.O. establishment. The Officers concerned are directly under the Government of India, and the arrangement with t ^ ~ 4-v, o rprnverv of expenditure Foreign Office is one for tue recovery incurred,/ 1685b 5000 1-27incurred, rattier than for the loan of of ’icorr. The consideration in the cane of an O-Liicer on Foreign Service that the terns of his loan cannot he varied during its currency cannot therefore apply. The Foreign Office, having agreed in principle to refund a moiety of the expenditure of the Government of India, could have no reasonable objection to an increase in the amount charged to bring it into accord with the actual cost of maintaining the establishment, w ith effect from the date from which the increase can he shown to he justified, in this case the 27 th January 1922* It follows that the practice 6 i. charging the old C.S.R. rates of contribution in respect of service of the officers since 27th January 1922 was unnecessary and incorrect, and that the accounts require adjustment with a view to remedying this error a.s well as the one discovered in your department. It is suggested the present affords a suitable opportunity for doing this. In this connection attention is invited to certain proposals on a Financial Department file (F. Colin.14-3/8 ), for the % * revision of the rates of pension contribution in a direction favourable to the foreign employer. In view of their probable early receipt, it might be advisable to await the Government of India’s proposals in this matter, before writing to the Foreign Office. (Sd.) W.A.

The position of the annual adjustments with the Foreign Office is that the account for 1922-2 is still open, that for 1923-24 has been agreed, and those for the two subsequent years for which claims have been preferred are also unsettled. The proposed letter to the Foreign Office arose out of an error of compilation only and was partly due to the misleading nature of a Foreign Office statement of expenditure. Hence, vide para.3 of the letter, it is considered justifiable to claim a refund from 1922 - 23 , irrespective of the agreement of the accounts for 192^,-24. There is a distinction between an error of this nature and the readjustment suggested by the Auditor, where rather an error of judgment occurred, if his-view is upheld. I think it is correct and that/the question resolves .itself °'- attempting to impose a readjustment on the foreign Office .despite our letter.

From the red ink figures v/nich my Department has added on page ? of Enclosure 2 to the Govei'mment of India’s Despatch it will be seen that the proposed new rates for pension « &lt; contribution, though higher than the C.S.R. rates, t . t do not differ from them materially, and my view in any case is that while these rates (if approved cy the Secretary of State in Council) may be appropriately applied in the case of accounts still t *' * . open, there is no sufficient ground for proposing to reopen any accounts already closed with a view to readjusting the sums charged. I agree with you that the question of adjusting rates of pension contribution differs from' that of adjusting arithmetical errors. (Sd.) W. Robinson. 23.8.28.The Sinanuiul aecrc tai^ .

In 1924 the India Office (vide their letter Bo.

Liking ton which was stated to have been included in the Dizful Accounts for August 1921. Credits of Rs.611/9/11 and Rs. 366/15/7 were however, included in schedule 26 for February 1922 at items 126 and 127 on account of recoveries from this officer, and these items are still outstanding on the Remittance Books. I would take this opportunity to point out that many items have been included by you sx in the Outward Account Current under the head ’'Bills and Telegraphic Transfers drawn on India by the High Commissioner for Iraq.' which are in the nature of Miscellaneous expenditure at various consulates, and which hxx* would appear to be susceptible of adjustment in the accounts of Diplomatic and Consular Services. Several of the original items nave been written back in subsequent schedules, out no adjustment is traceable in respect of the xxxxxx items shown on the attached statement. It will be seen that the net amount unadjusted is £ 1,402.4s. 7d and that this sum under its present appropriation is presumably due t o the Imperial Government, but before taking steps to pay this amount I shall he glad if youVall investigate the items, and if they are correctly adjustable on the Remittance books, give a reference to the month's schedules in wnic^i tue-■ - original debits were included of which the minus entries um.er reference are writes back.

With reference to India Office letter (P.4339/27) of the 8th November last regarding diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, I am directed by Secretaiy Sir Austen Chamberlain to state that he has again had under consideration, in conjunction with His Majesty’s Treasuiy, the question of expenditure on the wages of Bakhtiari Sowars for February and March, 1919, but that he is unable to alter the decision conveyed in Foreign Office letter K 11977/777/234 of the 7th September last. 2. In this connexion I am to observe that the Consul- General at Ispahan was at that time an officer of the Government of India, and that the payments in question were made at his request at a date subsequent to December 26th, 1918, when the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to participate further in the expenditure was notified to your department. Sir Austen Chamberlain agrees that due weight would be attached to the conditions then prevailing, had the payments been made justifiably in the absence of a decision as to the acceptance of liability; but a decision had, as stated above, already been announced, and he cannot admit any degree of responsibility for the subsequent expenditure, which was, moreover, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, without justification. 3. As the advance by the Sheikh of Mohammerah covers &amp;»000, fifty thousand rupees out of an expenditure of eighty iive Under-Secretary of State, India Office. thousand5,709. thousand seven hundred and nine rupees in connexion with the Ahwaz Consulate buildings, it is considered necessary to 0,000, reduce the item of sixty thousand rupees to thirty thousand 0,000. rupees as an advance on account. 4. Having regard to the latter reduction, His Majesty’s Treasury have sanctioned a second advance of nine 00. thousand pounds on account of the adjustment of the joint expenditure in 1924 - 1925. I am accordingly to return to you herewith the receivable order which was enclosed in your letter under reply, and to request that you will transmit in 00. due course a receivable order for the sum of nine thousand pounds. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Consulate Buildings debited in 1924-H5. The original debits were converted into sterling at 1/3.7*51 and l/5.417d the rupee, respectively, but the credits are being converted at l/6.7/48d the rapee. It would, however, be more in accordance with the usual practice in cases of adjustments with' Imperial Government Departments, for the write-backs to be converted at the rates applied to the original deoito. The statement of expenditure by the ■ nice of Works, attached to the Tbreign Office claim, i , .c’750/2'5 includes an addition of 7^ on the net expenditure, 'for cost of administration,' which it has not previously been the practice to charge. It seems desirable that India should be asked to confirm that a reciprocal charge is always added to the expenditure under Civil Works in the annual statements. A certificate regarding Major General Douglas is attached. tf/l/T'* The Auditor, Your reference to the write-hack of Ha.30,000 relating to the Ahwaz Consulate as leading to a credit to the Foreign Office on the basis of exchange s.d et #/6 ^q seems to have been made under a misapprehension. The adjustment has been made, vide Enclosure I, in the column of figures relating to 1924-25 and in effect reduces the amount repayable by the Foreign Office for that year by Rs.-* 5 - 0 ^ 0 ^ 1/5*417 i.e., £1,088.11.3. As regards the general principle to govern the exchange in readjustment transactions, I consider that it is somewhat late in the day to introduce the practice to which you refer.in these accounts. In this connection your attention is directed to the / i/, k I1924 / 2014 5000 5/27 tfinute Paper. Department. the reference (flagged) addressed to you on the 11th June 19^4 (A.G.7453/24) regarding a similar write-back. This Department’s views as then expressed are equally applicable in the present instance, but I suggest that expediency is the chief factor that should govern exchange in regard to these somewhat troublesome Be^-t and Oradi-t- claims on the Foreign Office. it will not be overlooked that in post war years when the rupee exchange ruled high large arrear charges appeared in the Indian statements in respect of the war period, when the rate was very much lower, thus in effect giving India a profit on the exchange. Readjustments of the nature in question ; at any rate of serious magnitude,will be extremely rare in future and moreover s.d. tne uniform rate of 1/6 the rupee will soon be effective in these accounts. In the circumstances, does the Auditor desire to press his views regarding the rate of exchange applicable to the write^back of the flour charges? The mistake made with regard to the adjustment of Rs.30,000 is regretted. By eliminating this item trom the Ahwaz Consulate account for 1925/26 and including it in the statement for 1924/25, you have in effect adjusted the write back at the original rate of exchange* I do not think that adjustment of the item of Rs.87,787 on the same basis would be any more likely to cause the Foreign Office to reopen the question oi past arrear charge s. In the case of the write back discussed in June. I 1924 I agreed to your proposal for special reasons, but where, as in the present case, such do not exist, I think that the more usual practice which was followed, e.g. in the War accounts, of adiusting write backs at the rate of the original transaction should be adhered to. Further write backs'of Rs. 1,11,802.4.5 in respect of 1922/23 and Rs. 1 , 62 , 850 in respect of 1924/25 may be necessary in future diplomatic and Consular Accounts. r i!iie Auditor, The inconsistency suggested in your first paragraph overleaf has some justification, in that the original flour debit of Hs.3,03,£84:11:10 was tacitly accepted by the Foreign Office in their letter dated 11th October 19£7 (P.4809/E7), whereas in the other ca.se they definitely turned down the suggestion that the excess debit should be adjusted in a subsequent account and scaled down their further instalment for 19^4-25 accordingly. as, however, the balance of the amount claimed from the Foreign Office for 19££-£3 still outstanding, i.e. £7,017; 8; 3, exceeds a moiety of the equivalent of both the sum of Hs.87,787 on account of the excess flour debit and that of Rs.1,11,802 relating to Major lioel's expenditure on Baxhtiari levies in 1917-18 which is still under reference to India, I think it best to follow the analogy of the Ahiraz buildings write-back in the 1924-25 account by taking the credit of Rs.87,787 right/;inute Paper. Department. right out of the 1925-E6 ucoount, and to reduce the outstanding sum of £7,017: 8; 3 in respect of 192^-23 s d by the equivalent of this credit at 1/3.7E9 the rupee. This would meet your point and at the same time render it unlikely that the Foreign Office would raise objection and bring up the general question of the treatment of belated adjustments and writes-back for exchange purposes. It would, however, be without prejudice to this general question, as I still consider a policy of special treatment of isolated amounts in this account, because they happen to be on a somewhat larger scale than usual, to be impolitic. Writes-back are by no means rare, nor are cases of belated appropriations in the Diplomatic and Consular statements, so that the logical application of the procedure suggested by you would lead to considerable difficulties. The statements have been re-cast accordingly, and the draft letter amended. Your early concurrence is requested. I feel inclined to suggest to the Foreign Office that as the statements submitted to them are audited they should in future be accepted for immediate payment on the understanding that if the Foreign Office should have objections to raise that necessitate adjustments, these would be effected in the following account. This would obviate the piecemeal and belated settlement of the accounts that has been so troublesome during the last few years. 1058 5000•aft Paper. *— 7- •sq's^lujiy (ACCOUNTAKT-GMSRAL' Sy ,! t The Under Secretary of State, The Foreign Office, S.W.

It will be observed that the sum due to Indian Revenues in respect vr of these establishments is £12,610:2:9. In addition a sum of £321:8:6 is recoverable from your Department in respect of a moiety of the amount payable to the Persian Government on 1st March 1926 on account of the Jask Royalty. This sum is the equivalent of Rs.4285:ll:- charged in schedules received from India for the month of October 1926. 3. To these amounts must be z added the sum of £1,147:6:- due to Indian Revenues on account of expenditure relating to places outside Persia. The total amount recoverable is thus £14,108:17:3 (£12,640:2:9 + £321:8:6 4- £1,147:6:-) and a Receivable drder for this is accordingly enclosed in view to its transfer to the account of the Secretary of State for India at the Bank of England. 4.

In presenting this claim, I am to draw your attention to the inclusion of ‘charges for sterling t Overseas Pay issued to various officers on the Persian Establishment It will be seen that arrear charges on this account for 1924-25 have been notified by the Government of India as a result of the enquiry addressed to them to which reference was made in the third paragraph of my letter of the 22nd March 1927, No.P.748-9/1927^ 5.

It is assumed that the final adjustment will accordingly appear in the 1925-27 accounts. In the meantime, however, the desire, of your Department for the reduction of Rs.30,000 in the claim on this account, expressed in the letter dated 19th January 1928, No.K.16993/ 777/234, has been met by the adjustment of the figures relating ! to 1924-25 in the appropriate s ^auements/ •X* See enclosures 1 and 6.Department. statements (ifticlosures 1 and 3) forwarded herewith.

Complete adjustment of this account depends, presumably, on the outcome of the request made by your Department, in the letter dated 11th October 1927, No.K.11826/777/234, for an auditor’s certificate in respect , of the sum of Rs.1.11,802:4:5 referred to in that letter, regarding which no communication/fr^Tk Tl ^r\ t 1 [ I f : : f: ' . f-l h If corarnunication has yet been received from the Government of India. 7.

P 2591/27 of l&amp;l n 29th August last on the subject of the adjustment of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia in respect of the year ended March 31st, 1923, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to state that it would appear from the further information given by the Government of India that the charge of Rs. 1,11,802/4/5 may have some connexion with the expenditure incurred by Captain Roel which was reported in the enclosure to India Office letter Ro. P 4477 of the 13th November, 1917. 2 . It is observed that the expenditure reported by Captain Noel was to be provisionally debited to the Special Secret Service expenditure account which was presumably opened as a result of the general orders referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter. In view of this it is possible that the disbursements of Captain Noel were included in the statement of Secret Service expenditure during the years 1915-16 to 1920-21 which was the subject of special adjustment between the Imperial Government and the Government of India in 1923. 3. As it is impossible to identify the charge in question from the records available in this department, I am to request that an auditor’s certificate may be obtained from the Government of India to the effect that the sum of Rs. 1,11,802/4/5 has not previously been included in any 16 Uncier -Secretary of State , India Officeany claims preferred against the Imperial Government. 4. I am further to refer to the fourth paragraph of Foreign Office letter of the 1st August, 1925 (K 5726/1966/254) and to enquire whether it is yet possible to supply the particulars therein requested.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to refer to your letter of the 7th September,No.K11977/ 777/234, relative to the statement of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia incurred by the Government of India in the year 1924-25. APPROVED COUNCIL 8 NOV 1927 113 9r 5000 4/2G 2. As regards the Government of India’s claim on account of the sum of Rs.1,62,850, representing the wages of Bakhtiari i Sowars for the months of February and March, 1919, I am to say that the correspondence referred to in i your letter was not overlooked; i but the Secretary of State for India | sees no reason, on the facts as they j appear from that correspondence,why | it should be suggested that the i whole of the expenditure in question, which appears to have been incurred by the Consul-General at Ispahan on the supposed authority of Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No.421 of the 14th AugustAugust 1918, should be accepted as a charge on Indian revenues. In • his view the expenditure must be regarded as an incident of the confused local circumstances prevailing at the time, which make the application of strict rules as to sanction inappropriate; and the proper and equitable course is that it should be equally divided between the Indian and Imperial exchequeisas proposed by the Government of India. He trusts that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will on reconsideratior. agree, and will address the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury accordingly. Meanwhile he agrees Mf thao this charge may be held in suspense. 3. With regard to the expenditure || on the Ahwaz Consulate buildings I am to point out that of the total expenditure of Rs.85,?09 referred to in my letter of the 19th October, 1926, !;o.P.3284/26, a sum of Rs.50,000 is covered by an advance made under contract by the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The net cost to Government of the abandoned building scheme will therefore be less than the item oi ns.60,000 entered in the Government of India’s Statement !^ or 1924-25. Rut a reference toDraft Paper Department my letter of the 23rd August, 1927, No.P.3795/27, will show that the total net cost to Government is not yet assessable, and the Secretary of State would prefer that the item of Hs.60,000 in the Statement should stand, on the understanding that the requisite adjustment will be made in the next accounts of the Government of India. This the Government of India will be item of Rs.11,415 in respect of the Ahwas Sanitary Department is not available here and is being sought from the Government of India. by the holding in suspense of the first item referred to above and the temporary withdrawal of the third is Rs.1,74,265, equivalent to £12,650 approximately, a moiety of which is £6,325.

In respect of the item of Hs.3,03,284.11.1C included in the Ghiras Consular account as Secret Servico honey, representing the net loss on flour sent to Shiraz during 1916 and 1917, the Government of India make the following; remarks;- •The accounts of the late Controller of Far Accounts * showed that there were two consignments of wheat and flour 'to Shiraz, viz.:- one of 750 tone and ono of 1000 tons, which 'cost with their freight charges Ks*3,40*433-5-10. as the '‘sale proceeds were only Rs.37,146-10-0, the apparent loss to 'Government was Re.3,03,284-11-10. It has since been ’’discovered, however, that of in© second consign ®nt only 250 'tons of flour and 250 tons of wheat were despatched to 'Shiraz, half of the balance being, sent to Basra and half 'being taken over by the South Persia Rifles, The revised 2 he Under Secretary of State, foreign office.

'It may be mentioned that at this time there was 'considerable scarcity in the Shiraz country amounting; almost 'to a famine owing: to two previous harvests being bad and to\ 'non-arrival of winter rains. Serious distress prevailed as 'a consequence and this was undoubtedly relieved by the 'despatch of flour. H It has been ascertained that the Government of India have adjusted the difference between the amount originally inserted in the statement of expenditure (Rs.3,03,284,11.10) and the revised figure (Rs.2,15,497.4.0) by giving credit in the Persian Diplomatic and Consular Expenditure accounts for 1925-26. I am to refer, in this connexion, to paragraph 2 of your letter of the 1st August, 1925, and to point out that Forei^i Office letter No* 204537/^/34 of the 27th[7V) October, 1917, which accepted a moiety of the estimated cost of 25,000 tomans, related only to the second consignment of flour sent to Shiraz, The consent of His Majesty’s Government to bear half the cost of the first consignment (of 750 tons) was communicated to this Department by Foreign Office letter No. W 5273/1917, dated the 11th January, 1917. 3. Regarding the sura of Rs.1,11,802.4.5, stated fomerly to represent expenditure incurred by Captain Noel in connexion with Bakhtiari levies in 1917-18, the Government of India have made the following statement:- tt It is realised that a certain amount of confusion ”existed in regard to the expenditure on the Baditiari ^forces (i.e., Bakhtiari Levies and Gscort) that were raised 'during the war. m exa ination of our records shows, 'however, that item (L 1) for Rs.1,11,802/4/5 represents '’expenditure incurred by ajor Noel in 1916-1917 (and not '1917-1918 as given in the Statements) in connection with 'local levies under the general orders conveyed in Foreign 'and iolitical Department’s telegram No. i.3.327, dated the ,! l9th March, 1915, to the Political Resident in the Persian 'gulf and reported the same day to the India Office by 'Viceroy’s telegram. It also appears from our records that 'the amount of item (L 1) constitutes the total expenditure 'on this account for 191-1917, and the item of 'Rs. 1962/14/3 which is included in the statement for 1921- '1922 on account of Bakhtiaris cannot therefore be connected 'thereto. It should therefore be assigned to (L 2). Item '(L 2) for ks.3,36,150/12/0 represents expenditure incurred 'by Major Noel in 1918-1919 on account of wages to Bakhtiari sowars from October 1918 to January 1919. This refers to 'Treasury sanction communicated in India Office telegram No. 'P. 418, dated tie 19th January, 1921, and in this connection Attention is also invited to Viceroy’s telegram No. 454-S, dated the 28th March, 1921, in which the authority under 'which'which payment* were made is quoted.' In respect oi the correspondence quoted in this statement reference may be made to the following letters:- India Office to Foreigi Office, No. P. 1076, dated 19th March, 1915. foreign Office to --noia Office, C 14652/9869/34, dated 31st December, 1920. India Office to Foreign Office, No. P. 1641, dated 1st April, 1921. 4. The Government of India have offered tne following explanation of the delay in brin/ in/ tlie above- mentioned charges to account:- 'The delay in the case of Shiraz wheat and flour | transaction was due to the fact that the Military ..ccounts ^ 'authorities were not aware at the time that the two 'consignments in question were unconnected with supplied “the Expeditionary Forces in Persia and the cost of t 'coneij nments was apparently in the first instSiiCe char: ed M 'against the War Office through the Far Accounts. The 'incorrectness of this was brought to the notice of the 'Controller of ar Accounts for the first time in July 1922 'and the necessary readjustments were made by him in the 'accounts for 1922- , 23. The delay in the case of the 'Balhtiari Levies was due to the late receipt of accounts 'from esoootajnia. The delay on the part of the Consulate 'authorities in submitting the accounts in both these 'connections was due to the unsettled state of affairs in 'Persia at the time.' 5. I am to ask that the final adjustment of the account! for 1922-23 may now be made by the payment to this (ffice of the sum of £7,017.8s.3d., that is still outstanding. 6. I am at the same time to point out that the fur+ v - communication in connexion with the claim upon your department in respect of the year 1924-25, referred i?r0 igi Office letter No. X 4580/777/234, dated 31st larch ist, has not yet been made to this Office, and to request iat an early adjustment of that claim also may be effected. i this connexion attention is dra^ni to the penultimate iragraph of the letter from this Office, No. P 748-9/1927, ited 22nd arch, 1927, transmitting the claim in question.

As regards the flour accounts, a further reference has been found in P.2867/24 (now flagged) from the Acoountant-rGeneral, Central Revenues. in that letter it is stated that charges totalling R s . 201,856.7.3. were incurred in connection with the transport &amp;c. of the flour &amp;c. to Shiraz. This heavy item probably furnishes the explanation of the small amount of the sale proceeds which the Government , of India .in the demi-official letter of the 5th May were at a loss to account for. On the receipt of the letter from the Accountant-General, Central Revenues, the Foreign Office were repaid half the equivalent of Rs.2, 01,856. 7.3. on the ground that the net loss on the flour transactions, i.e. Rs.3,03,284,11,10. had been charged in the P. &amp; c. Account for 1922-23. The last mentioned amount is that now in dispute with the Foreign Office and perhaps it was rather premature to make the refund, as the write-back of the amount from the account on which the original claim of a moiety of £319,818. on the Foreign Of fice was merely transferred the item in question from one divisible head to another, this second one being adjustable 2 years in arrear It will be observed that the Government of India's demi-official letter indicates the discovery of an error in the amount claimed in the 1922-23 D. &amp; C. Account of considerable magnitude. The net loss of Rs.3,03,284.11.10. now turns out to be Rs.2,15,4S7.4.-. only. The matter is referred to in a distinctly casual manner and it seems sirable that confirmation should be obtained before the claim on the Foreign Office is amended, especially in order that the position in regard to the incidence of the cost of the/. r the portion of the consignment assigned to the the accounts of that formation have been closed Office off their share of the cost of the flour should this still .Toe outstanding ^merely because it should have been claimed under a head that is closed. A draft letter to India is accordingly attached. The question of its issue officially or demi-officially has been left for the Political Secretary’s decision. ^ isLUJi AxSJtfXU O' c/a^c u* South Persia Eifles may be determined, as although there seems to be no ground for letting th© ForeignP.2591/27 /,07 Adiustment of D inlomat io and Consular jocpenditure Jn T9~?2-2?f With reference to Mr. Lothian^ demi-oificial letter No.94 (5)-A dated 5th May 1927^1 am asked to state that it is not clear how it is proposed to effect the adjustment necessitated by the reduction of the charge foi the net loss on the consignment of flour and wheat to Shiraz from Hs.3,03,284.11.10. to hs.2,15,497.4.-., whether by amendment of the T statement relating to 1922-23 on which a claim has already been preferred upon the Foreign Office, or by giving a credit in the next account to be rendered, i.s. in respect of 1925-2o. The former course is preferred in view of the length of time that has elapsed since the enquiries into the matter were first instituted as the result of the Foreign Office letter of the 1st August 1925, and of the desire of that Department for an early settlement. z. A second point arises from the letter under reference. As a proportion of the consignment of 1,000 tons of flour etc was taken over by the South Persia Hifles^the charge in respect of this portion was divisible with the Foreign Office in any case. I am accordingly to enquire whether the necessary inclusion of the charge in the accounts relating to that formation was duly effected in view to adjustment with the Foreign Office, or whether it is still outstanding, as in the latter event the Foreign Office would be asked to defray/defray a moiety in settling the Diplomatic and Consular expenditure claim, the South Persia Rifles account having been closed, vide the letter from the Military Accountant General No.2181 F.C. dated 13th January 1927 to this Office. 3 . It would be convenient if you could reply to this letter by telegram in order that the Foreign Office may be placed ih possession of the information desired by them.at the &lt; . earliest possible moment and I have, therefore, to ask that you will telegraph whether you concur in the adjustment of the reduction of the amount referred to in the first paragraph at once by this Office, and whether a claim is to be preferred on the Foreign Office in respect of a moiety of the cost of the flour etc.supplied to the South Persia Rifles, in which case the amount of the cost should be reported.

The accounts of the late Controller of War Accounts showed that there were two consignments of vdieat and flour to Shiraz viz:- one of 750 tons and one of 1Q0Q tons,which cost with their freight charges Is. 3,40,433-5-10. As the sale proceeds were only 37,148-10-0, the apparent loss • to Government was Is. 3,05,234-11-10.

It is regretted that no informtion is forthcoming as to the reasons for the high figure for the cost of the flour and wheat or why the net sale proceeds were so low 'beyond the explanation in our telegram ITo. 1080-3, dated the 29th December 1916, that the intention was to sell flour 'below the market rate in order to ease the scarcity attributed by agitators to the presence of British forces. It mav he mentioned that at this time -'here was considerable scarcity in the Shiraz country, a: auntin^ almost to a faiaine owning to two previous harvests being bau'bad and to non-arrival of winter rains. Serious distress- prevailed as a consequence and this was undoubtedly relieved by the despatch of flour. &gt; 3.

It may be mentioned, however, in this connection that His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz roughly estimated that the loss to' Government, if his proposal to sell flour at a cheap rate were accepted, would in respect of the first consignment of 750 tons of flour be 35 tomans a ton, or approximately 26,250 tomans, vide the Govern eni oi Inuia*s ^telegram Ho. iOSQ-S, date^ 29th December 1916, to His Majesty’s Secretary of Staue for India, replied to by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Indiacor I USX India in his telegram, dated the 17th January 1917. 4. As regards the question of delay in bringing this charge a»nd also that relating to the Bakhtiari Levies to account, I am to offer the following remarks. The delay in the case of Shiraz, wheat and flour transaction was due to the fact that the Military Accounts Authorities were not aware at the time that the two consignments in question were unconnected with supplies to the Expeditionary Forces in Persia and the cost of the consignments was apparently in the first instance charged against the/'War Accounts. The incorrectness of this was brought to the notice of the Controller of ^ar Accounts for the first time in July 1922 and the necessary readjustments were made by him in the accounts for 1922-*23* The delay in the case of the Bakhtiari Levies was due to the late receipt of accounts from Mesopotamia. The delay on the part of the Consulate Authorities in submitting the accounts in both these connections was due to the unsettled state of affairs in Persia at the time.

In addition, a further saving will accrue to Central revenues as questions. a result of the question raised by this Department regarding re-classification of pensions (vide para. 11 of Section II of this Report). The total amount credited to Central revenues up to date is about £200,000, and the annual amount involved is about £50,000. These figures will be further increased when the re-classification is completed. 3.

See the second paragraph of the letter to the Government of India dated the 7th October 1924 - F.4254/24, which was noted by the Accountant-General. The increase in the rate of contribution is due to the fact that the previous rates were involving Government in loss. The Foreign Office having accepted the principle of a pension and leave salary contribution, can scarcely raise any objection to its adjustment to fulfil its purpose. - sV lu any further communication on this subject, please quote No - K 5726/1966/234. and address 1% not to any'person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 2575 L Foreign Office.

ENCLOSURE No. P. 1254. India Office, Sir, 28th April 1915. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter of the 25th March 1912, No. 7797/1 2 , regarding the inclusion of charges in respect of leave and pension in the annual statement of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. The rates on which the Indian charges have been calculated were set forth in this Office letter of the 14th July 1911, which stated that the contri butions were assessed at a fixed proportion of the pay drawn, ranging from one-fourth in the case of higher officers to one-fifth and one-sixth in the case of subordinate officers. In 1912 the Secretary of State sanctioned a revision of these rates, as set forth in the enclosure to the Government of India’s Letter No. 85, dated 5th March 1915 (copy enclosed). It is accordingly proposed to apply the revised rates (which were sanctioned for general adoption on the understanding that the increase was required for the protection of Indian revenues) in assessing the leave and pension contributions recoverable from the Imperial Government in connection with the Consular and Diplomatic services in Persia,* with effect from the beginning of the current financial year. His Lordship assumes that Sir Edward Grey will have no objection to this course, but before he approves the Government of India’s recommendation he will be glad to receive an intimation of the concurrence of your Department. It will be observed that the new rates provide for privilege leave allowances as well as the allowances attached to other kinds of leave that were covered by the old rates. Privilege leave allowances drawn by officers employed in Persia would therefore be excluded from the annual claim on your Department when the new rates of contribution are introduced.

The papers therefore focus on financial adjustments to be made between the India Office and the Foreign Office. Accounts of this expenditure can therefore be found within the file, along with supplementary correspondence. This correspondence is concerned with querying or disputing items of expenditure, or with changes to accounting practices. This correspondence is primarily between officials of the India Office (primarily the Account General and the Under Secretary of State for India), Foreign Office officials (primarily the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), and representatives of the Government of India (primarily the Accountant General and the Foreign Secretary).Specific matters discussed include adjustments to be made for the salary of John Calcott Gaskin, a query related to the payment of the salaries of Sir Percy Cox and Stuart George Knox during the First World War, a dispute over the refusal by the Foreign Office to take a share of maintenance of Bakhtiari Sowars in Persia during February-March 1919 (see ff 152-158 for detailed notes), construction work at the Ahwaz Consulate, the supply of flour to Shiraz in 1916-17, and an adjustment in the charges for civil works.The following sets of financial papers can be found within:expenditure by the Imperial Government in Persia, and at Nakawn Lampang (Lakhon) and Chiengmai.

Statements for the following years can be found within the file: 1920-21 (ff 580-588), 1921-22 (ff 532-543), 1922-23 (ff 454-465), 1923-24 (ff 392-404), 1924-25 (ff 335-346), 1925-26 (ff 221-233 and ff 243-255, two copies), and 1926-27 (ff 118-129 and ff 68-79, two copies);specific statements are also supplied for expenditure on the Koweit Agency as follows: 1920-21 (ff 590-591), 1921-22 (ff 545-546), 1922-23 (ff 467-468), 1923-24 (ff 406-407), 1924-25 (ff 348-350), 1925-26 (ff 234-236 and 256-258, two copies), and 1926-27 (ff 130-132);records of financial adjustments made between the India Office and the Foreign Office between 1921-22 to 1927-28: see f 575, f 525, f 475, f 448, f 413, f 387, f 332, and f 220.The creation dates cover the bulk of papers within the file. However a printed copy of a letter dated 25 June 1915 with enclosures dating back to 2 June 1915 has also been included. It concerns a revision to the rates at which leave and pension contributions are calculated.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
