The report concerns the options being considered by Government for the concession of the Bagdad [Baghdad] railway’s extension to Bussorah [Basra], under proposal with the Turkish Government. Following the report is an appendix (folios 88-91) which is a memorandum on the commercial possibilities of three railway proposals in Mesopotamia, prepared by the Commercial Department of the Board of Trade in 1909.
