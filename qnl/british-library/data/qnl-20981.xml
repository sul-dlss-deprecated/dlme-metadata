X .iii., Bahrain. I have the honour to refer to your letter to oir Arthur Hirtzel, dated the 4th September,1919, in which you requested:- (1) that your father may have equality with the Arab Rulers in his neighbourhood in the exercise of authority over all Arab subjects residing in his territory; (2) that the selection of the members of Majlis al Urfi may be one of his rights like the Shara and balifah courts; (3) that H.M.Govt. will allow him to open the port of Zubarah which he alleges is the territory of his forefathers; and (4) that he may be given the previlege of reference to the seat of Government in Lon Ion, whenever necessary. 2, I am directed to inform you that the Govt, of India have given these requests their most careful consideration and I am to make the following reply.- I am to express regret that it is impossible for the Govt, of India to acoede to the request that your father ahouli exoeroise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab Rulers residing in Bahrain unless the Rulers concerned themselves make formal agreements to this el feet. ,,3 to the second request, 1 am to point out that the procedure for the selection of members of the Majlis al yrfi is laid down in the Bahrain order -in-Gouncil which was promulgated by the order of Kis Majesty the King -Emperor and . nf the Government of India to it is not within the competence ot the oov alter this procedure. But it is understood that tne Arab re presentatives in the Majlis are always appointed by your father and though this appointment is subject to the approval ... .1 o-^nt as representative of the protecting of the Political Agent repio . 1 ...,,j T ,0d that the political Agent will power, you may rest assured T.na. -i t oti and will no t inter'' ^ .,rw -nrrmer selection ciiiu. never disapprove of any pr p fere without just cause. WithWith ragard to ths opening of a port at Zubarah you are awara that this question is an old one and has ±n the past receivsd much consideration. It has,again, been oarefully examined, and I am to express regret that in view of the many difficulties which exist, the Government of India donot see their way to permit and assist your father to carry out this project. lour fourth request is to be given the privilege of direct preference to His Majesty's Government in London. It is known to you that the political relations of Bahrain / are conducted with the Govt, of India and it is therefore appropriate that the Government of India and not His Majesty's Government should be addressed by your father. It is unnecessary to add that any communications he may make will receive most careful consideration and will, if neces sary, be forwarded to His Majesty's Government. I remain with much consideration.1:0. Ivlfl) of 1920, Consulat Eusniro, Septembor 1920, British Ros:' donoy ud Consulate-C ■ noral To The P o 11 tical A,^orrt ?
