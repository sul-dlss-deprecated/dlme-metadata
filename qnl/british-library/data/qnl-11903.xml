Authorities and date. —St. John, 1867 ; TVra.r1rha.rT&gt; 1887 Epitome .—The most important and direct route to the Per sian plateau. In parts difficult for mules and very arduous on account of steep passes. Not more than one brigade with a pro* portion of other arms could use the road in one day. For the first four stages the road traverses flat open country which is liable to become impassable for camels, and difficult for mules, after heavy rain. Then the road rises over 5 main passes which in winter may be blocked for a week at a time by snow. The route is passable by infantry and cavalry, but not — - - 7 ?

Animals must move in single file over the passes, and in some places horses must be led. Riding camels have been taken along the road. Loads should ride high on mules as projecting rocks interfere with them when low. Camels could be used as line of communication transport in dr\ w eat rer on stages 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and on stage 1 in dry weather after a week’s work on the road by a battalion of pioneers. To make the whole road rossable for laden camels, the align ments would have to be altered on the passes, and it is estimated that each pass would occupy a company of pioneers a week. To enable carts to be used, a road would have to be made across the mashllch (stage 1), and a complete re-alignment of the passes undertaken; a six month s task at least for one batta lion of pioneers at each pass. There are five main passes, details of which will be found in the Gazetteer. , p ;i) The Kutal-i-Malu (stage 5), a very steep ascent of over 1,000 feet by a narrow’broken track. ‘2) The Kutal-i-Ramarij (stage 6), an ascent of 1,200 feet in about 2 miles, by a path which is too narrow to allow laden mules to pass. (3) The Tang-i-Turk&amp;n (stage % a pass through a narrow defile, over jagged boulders, with a steep descent. (4-\ The Kutal-i-Dukhtar (stage 10), a very steep climb of 1,400 feet up a paved staircase. '6) The Kutal-i-Pir-i-Z&amp;n(stage 11), a distressing track with steep ascent and descent: rises to 7,400 feet. There is also the mashileh, a strip of low -lying ground between Bushire and the mainland, about 12 miles broad, where, during the winter months, mules sink fetlock deep into, the mud, and other transport could not move. The road has been divided into three sections with military posts at considerable intervals, but at the same time the local Khans who had proved themselves trustworthy were made res ponsible for the road within their limits. All convoys move up amd down the road with small escorts (November 1919). Alternative routes.- —Route No. I (C) via Firuzabad, 30 m. longer than the post road, has less serious obstacles, but is considered less secure. This route is used by camel caravans, and could be made passable for wheeled transport.Route No. 1- Route No. 1 (B) via Jirreh. About the same length as the post road, but it runs through less fertile and less inhabited districts. Alternative stages .—Nrom Bushire to Borazjtin via Shlf. This entails a crossing by the boat, and avoids only a portion of From Kazarun to Dasht-i-Arjan via Abdui. This is much used by caravans, and is about 4 miles shorter : it avoids ^ the Kutal-i-Pir-i Zan, but crosses the same range by a pass described as difficult and dangerous for animals. N. B.

The coldest time is from December to February* At Shiraz the mean monthly minimum is sometimes a few degrees below freezing. Bain falls in November, December, January, February and March, but only a total of about 6 inches a year and on an average only on about 5 days in, each of the above months. ; The best period for marching is from 15th March to 15th May, and October and November. Except for a few donkeys on the first two or thre^ stages, mules are the only form of transport used in caravans on this route. The number of mules available on the road varied4 Route No. I—conic/. continually, and depends on the political situation, the security of the road, and the general demands for transport. In October 1911 there were about 1,500 working on the road; in January 1912 there were about 3,000. Kazarun and Borazjun are centres where mules can be hired. Hater.—With the exception of Ahmadi, Kunar Takhteh, and Kamarij, water is good and sufficient for a brigade and its transport at all seasons. During the rainy season the above places also have sufficient, but in the hot weather the supply becomes practically nil, without special means of extracting it. At all stages the supply of water gradually decreases during the summer and autumn, till rain begins to fall in November, from which time it increases again, being at its greatest about April. At and near Bushire the water is rather brackish and new comers become seriously affected by drinking it. Norton tube pumps are recommended for the stages where the supply is not from streams and by this means sufficient water for a brigade could always be obtained; also leather buckets and ropes are useful for drawing water from wells. Tanga .—If miles. Wells of good water. All Changi.—13 miles. Best water supply in Tangistan. 30 wells, sweet water. Lies off direct route to Borazjun. Chaghadalc .—15 miles. A few brackish wells. Ahmadi River .—20 miles. Water brackish but drinkable, November to March. Ahmadi .—22 miles. Brackish from 5 wells. Always water below surface which could be tapped by Norton tubes. * Khushdb .—33 miles. Sufficient water for a brigade from 60 shallow wells. Bordzjun .—40 miles. Twelve good wells. Ample for a brigade. Brackish. Fuel .—Fuel is the greatest difficulty along the road, and is almost unobtainable in the first three stages. Further on a certain amount is procurable, mostly in the form of tamarisk femshes in the lower country, and dwarf oak in the hills. ThisRoute No. l—contd. latter form is very plentiful between Kazardn and Dasht-i-Arjan. Transport should be provided for carrying at least one day’s supply, with a force. Grazing.—The grazing along the route is very scanty, many places having none whatever for horse, mule or camel. Bhoosa (chopped straw) is the only fodder available, and sufficient for 1,000 animals could.be collected in the vicinity of all stages. Camel grazing is reported to be nil. Supplies. —With some difficulty supplies sufficient for a bat talion of Indian Infantry with transport would be procurable all along the route at any time of year. Large quantities of barley are to be obtained in Kazarun after the harvest in June; also good supplies of rice, grain, vegetables and fruit. Live-stock is found only in limited quantities as far as Kazarun; but at Kazafun and onwards, with the exception of Mian Kutal, there would be sufficient for a brigade at least. Shiraz has ample supplies of all kinds in their season, and could support a division for a short time. For a month’s supplies at liushire for one brigade, at least a month’s notice should be given to the British Consul-General for Ears. The telegraph employes {ghuldms) are invaluable at each stage for collecting supplies. No. of stage and total Details. distance. ^ - - 1 CHAGHADAK .. 14 m. General direction E. The road runs S.-E. 14 m. for about 4 miles from Bushire town, along the shore of the Bushire peninsula, and then follows the telegraph line N.-E. for 12 miles across the mashileh, a mud swamp which the sea overruns at spring tides. In wet weather this is impassable for camels and diffi cult for mules. Route 1(C) branches off S. -E. half way. The village of Chaghadak is reached at 15 miles.

At 2 miles the road 21 m. crosses a water course and at 5 miles crosses the Ahram River ; the latter is frequently impassable for 24 hours after heavy rain. Water brackish, but drinkable from November to March. The road throughout the stage is dead level, and mostly over clay soil which gets slippery after rain. Ahmadi is on the left of the road, with the caravansarai on the right. Telegraph rest room. Route I (A) connects here. Camping ground. —Unlimited and good ; the best place for a small force is J mile north of the caravansarai* Water. —Brackish from 5 shallow wells, which quickly run dry. In the rainy season there is good drinking water for about 2,000 men and transport from 2 small tanks (db-ambars) about 600 yards N.-W. of the caravansarai. There is always water below the surface which could be tapped by Norton tube pumps. Animals should be watered at the stream which is crossed at 5 miles. Fuel. —Nil. Has to be brought from the hills. Provided that there were no inter-tribal hostilities there should be no difficulty in getting a large supply—say 3 to 6 tons at a mini mum ; possibly far more collected per week during the autumn spring season. Notice would have to be given. . Fodder .—Grazing for mules very poor and only in winter, none for horses or camels. Supplies .—Supplies of barley and bhoosa for about 2,000 animals obtainable by giving a few days’ notice ; also a few sheep. Supplies for man. unobtainable. 3 BORAZJUN .. 18 m. General direction N. —-— 250' by E. Following: 39 m. the telegraph line the road crosses flat country, which is clayey for the first 6 miles and then sandy for the remainder. At 5 miles pass the village of Israndi, | mile to E. of road. At 8| miles the track from Shit7 Route No. I— contd, ioins from the S.-W. At 11 miles reach village of Khushab consisting of a few detached settlements : here are 60 shallow wells each containing a few inches of drinkable water, sufficient for a brigade. At llj miles the dry bed of a large stream draining into the Shahpur river is crossed and several other watercourses are passed before reaching Borazjan. Borazjun contains about 400 houses and 3,500 inhabitants and is the principal town of Dashtistan. The which is turreted and loopholed could accommodate a battalion of ini anti y and a regiment of cavalry ; it contains a well, post and tele graph office and rest rooms.

General direction N. 400' by E. The road 54 ui. traverses several hillocks, with occasional deep cuttings to 6 miles where the small hamlet of Bandar is reached. Here are some small shallow wells at which at least 350 animals could easily be watered though the water is brackish and smells of sulphur. Road, especially the latter portion, is rough and stony but in places there is clayey soil which is grassy after rain. On west of road the plain is a dense reed-grown marsh. Fro n Rahdar the road makes a gradual ascent to 12 miles skirting the bass of the hills, and crossing at intervals shallow water channels. Here an alter native track, preferable in dry weather, branches off. Daliki is situated among date palms, and has a population of about 600. Supplies scanty, but grain, bhoosa and sheep can be procured from villages W. of the river, B bara, Mazax, etc., the mills near Daliki are capable of grind ng sufficient wheat for a brigade; fruit and vegetables obtainable in spring.' Grazing scanty. Fuel procurable from the hills near by, but there is little labour available for collecting it. British telegraph office and rest room.

General direction N.-E. TEH, 1,850/ On leaving the gg TO- village the road goes N.-W. over broken ground and makes an undulating ascent for 2 miles, when it becomes steeper, crossing rocks and smooth slabs of stone to the top of the Eilifili pass at 3 miles. The road from Borazj un to the Filifili pass is excellent for motors. Thence there is a constant descent down a ravine to 5 miles, where the road strikes a lateral ravine through which the Daliki river runs E. and W. Following the river on the left bank to about 7 miles, the road then crosses the river by a stone bridge of six arches, roadway 30 feet wide, paved with small stone blocks, in good repair. Then‘above the right bank, or in summer along the river bed to 8 miles. This first part of the road is a difficult defile. At 8 miles the ascent of the Kutal-i- Malu (see Gazetteer) begins. The track zigzags up in an almost due northerly direction, involving a rise of over 1,000 feet, which is very tiring for animals. About | of the way up there is a paved stairway, which should be avoided by taking a track to the right; this leads to the top of the first part of the pass, after which the track descends about 50 feet and then leads almost level up the stony bed of a ravine, for a mile. In this ravine there is a spring of good water. From here the final ascent of about 200 feet is very steep and difficult; at the top of the pass there is a tower and a tea-house. The ascent is about 3 miles, and occupies 2 to 3 hours. The remaining 4 miles of road is across a well-cultivated plain. Kunar Takhteh in the Khisht plain, contains a population of 400 Qashqai nomads. Khisht is under the control of the Khan of Galiki, though owned by the Niz r m-us-Sult'neh.

JFafer.—Water, during the winter months is sufficient for a brigade; for animals from nald 600 yards S. of camping ground ; for men from ambar in village. There is also, in winter a channel of sweet water from the Shahpur river, which runs about one mile N.-W. of serai. Drinking water for casual travellers is usually brought from a well at Buraki or at- Tang-i- Tiz. Fuel. —Abundant. Fodder. —Reported nil but inhabitants keep grass. Supplies. —Supplies, barley, straw, and sheep or goats sufficient for a brigade : flour has to be brought from the mills at DalikL Fowls procurable, dates abundant. 6 KAMARU .. 11 m. General direction rf.- ——— 2,950'. E. The road start* 80 m. ing due north, and crossing a level plain, passes the village of Ja’afarjlnat Smiles. The large village of Khisht is seen 4 miles to the W. in a grove of date palms ; a road branches ofi to this village from a point known as the Sar-i-Baureh-i-Khisht marked by a large block of stone. About J mile N. L of Ja’afarjin road enters a nald, which leads to a pass between low hills, ascent steep and easy, but descent steep and difficult. Then by a winding ravine to 4f miles, where road strikes the Sh^hpur river, and turns E. along its bank to 5f miles, where, at the village of Charum, it again turns through a cutting above the river to 6 miles; it then leaves river and turns E. following bed of stream m a defile, till at 8^ miles it begins ascent of Kutabi-Kamarij. The road from the Filifili pass to Charum is a good “ fair-weather motor road. The rise of 1,200 feet is effected in about 2 miles, and the path is very steep and narrow; at top of first part of path is a tea-house, from which road descends 30 feet to the bed of a sulphur stream, and follows this up a gorge for about 4 a mile, when tmal ascent of pass is made. From here the road leads through low hills, and, at miles lOf leaves main track and turns W. to Kamarij. Baggage animals in single file from mile 3^ to 10* Animals should be watered before leaving the Shahpur river. M51CGS «10 Route No. I— contd. Kam’rij, a village of about 800 inhabitants, lies in a va’ley ■with hills 600 to 800 feet high on three sides. A short cut from Kamarti to Kazarun, over a precipitous pass via Bardoon (?) is reported as being used by caravans in 1912 to evade Kashku- lis at RaMSr. Teiegraph rest-room, sarai in ruins. From Charum via Rudak to Kamarij sarai, the last 4 miles are difficult and cars have to be man-handed. Camping ground.- —Unlimited but mostly under cultivation. Water. —Water in winter sufficient for a brigade, from one sweet and some brackish wells f miles N.-N.-W. of village; in summer wells dry up; also from qandt near top of pass; though this place is unsuited for watering animals; water is plentiful in the Shalipur river for men and animals and though brackish, is drinkable. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Grazing good in spring, at other times scanty. Supplies .—Supplies of barley, bhoosa, and sheep for a brigade; flour has to brought from mills in the Shahpur valley. 7 RAHDAR *• 10 m. General direction N.- - 2,900'. E. The track joins the 90 m. main path at 1 mile and continues across the plateau, which gradually becomes closed in by the hills, and at 3 miles enters a narrow valley and passes a guard-house. This valley contracts suddenly and the Tang-i-Turkan (see Gazetteer) is entered. The path now becomes very rough and winds its way among rugged boulders, ascending the pass to 4^ miles. The descent on the far side is still rougher and continues to 6| miles where (he road descends on to low foot-hills, and leads over them parallel with hills on the E.; the hills on the W. gradually receding till Rahdar is reached. From Kamarij to Rahdar the road is good for camels, and cars can get along it. Road here very stony; baggage animals in single file from 3to 6£ miles. Rahdar, or Khwaja Ibrahim caravansarai contains about 20 houses and is a favourite halting place for mule caravans. The serai is in bad repair (1912), and .is commanded by the hills above it. The ruins of the ancient capital of King Shahpurf 11 //Z- Route N;. I— contd. are situated about 8 miles due N. A route from Bekbehilu connects here. Camping gvound. —Sufficient for a brigade. Water. —Ample. Fuel. —No details available. Fodder. —Excellent grazing ; no details. Supplies. —Reported plentiful but no details available. 8 KAZARUN .. H General direction S.- 2,900'. E. The road leads 101 7rlm down the centre ot the valley, which here is about 8 miles in width, and dotted with the black tents of the Mamassani nomads in summer* and those of the Qashqa 7 in spring and autumn. The path is stony, but suitable for camels. At 4 miles, near the half-ruined village of Dehrlz (or Dirist) the track from Shahpur joins in (Route I (v). The road then follows the left bank of a stream, and at 7 miles passes a coffee-house. The watershed of the valley is at or near Kazaran. There is an alternative road through the Tang-i-Turkan better than the one usually taken by caravans. It leaves the ordinary road just under the telegraph line at the entrance to the Tang and runs on the W. of the Tang 100 to 200 feet above the bottom of the gorge. It could, with little work, be made passable for carts. A short cut from Kamarij to Kazarfm runs over the hills N.-E. of the village. It saves a long detour out it is too steep for laden mules though probably fit for led horses as travellers have crossed it with lightly laden mules. Kazarun is the most important town between Bushire and Shiraz ; population 12,000 ; houses of stone and mortar, some loopholed. It is the headeuarters of a Deputy Governor who is responsible for the safety of the road between Tang-i- Turkan and Chinar Rahdar. There is a British telegraph office and a telephone to Borazjun and Dasht-i-Arjan, Accommoda tion good. Several sarais. Home of most muleteers of Ears. Route No* I(?i) from Jirreh connects here. Camping ground. —Camping ground S.-W. of town, in fields and orchards ; owing to the ground being much broken a whole brigade could not camp in one place ; good accomrno- c212 Route No. I—contd. dation in Bagh-i-Nazar, £ mile S.-W. of telegraph office, for two battalions. Another camping ground reported S.-E. of town, details nil. Boater.—Sufficient for brigade. Fuel .—Good supply in autumn and spring. Readily avail able from outside at all times. Fodder .—Good grazing in spring (one report says there is none). # Supplies .—Supplies of barley, wheat, flour, vegetables, ghi 9 sheep, all sufficient for a brigade for a fortnight; the valley is a rich one, mostly under cultivation : flour from mills on Shahpur river. 9 PfjL-I-ABGlNEH 8 m. General direction S.-E, From the road runs the 109 m. Telegraph Office along the outskirts of the town, passing, at a little over a mile, gendarmerie post Kal-i-Kabir on a high mound to the left of road ; at just under 2 miles, Bagh-i-M!rza, on the right of road. Cross several irrigation ditches, and at miles, for f mile, garden of pomegranates and grapes on either side. At 5 miles tower of Kamankashi on a low mound to the left of road ; to the right, away in plain, village of Nasirabad. The road now passes to the left of a low ridge of hills running in the middle of the plain down to Lake Famur. At just under 7 miles—200 yards left of road, a gendarmerie post. At 6 miles a ruined carav msarai with a newly built stone tower. fCaleh-i-ISTau or Kaleh-i-Shah Sultan.

Supplies. —The valley, to the S. is highly cultivated. Barley; wheat and rice are grown. 10 MIAN KUTAL .. 13 w?. General direction E. — by S. From Ful-i- 122 m. Abglneh the track ascends a stony plain, much cut up by water courses, rising to 3,300' at mile 3, where the foot of the mountain ridge is reached. A steep zigzag paved road, about 10' wide, considerably out of repair and full of holes, winds up the hill side. The summit of the Kutal-i-Dukhtar is reached at miles (4,200'). Here there is a IvfavgcJd tower. The track passes between two hills and at mile 5 emerges into an open valley, covered with oak trees (which are 30 to 40 feet high) and almond trees. At mile 5 there is a coffee shop, a tvfangchi tower on a hill about 50 feet high, and a reservoir which contains water only after rain. The main track goes E.-N.-E. towards Kaluni reaching the main water course of the valley at mile 6-J (4,000'). The track to Mian Kutal here turns E.-S.-E. There is a considerable amount of wheat and barley cultivation in the glades and intervals among the oak trees. At mile 11 (4,200') the foot of the Plr-i-Zan mountain is reached. The track ascends steeply by zigzags among the stones and rocks. The hill side is covered with trees, mostly oaks. At mile 13 the Mian Kutal caravansarai is reached (5,600'). Mian Kutal is situated on the top of a knoll on the mountain side, about 300 yards by 200 yards. There are twm buildings, the main stone-builo caravanserai which can accommodate about 300 men, and an older serai, falling into ruins and extremely dirty, adjoining and on the N. side of the stone caravanserai. From Pul-i-Abgineh to Ab-i-Gul (2 miles N. of Pir-i-Zan) motors can pass easily in dry weather but need manhandling in wet weather. Camping qrovni. —Restricted, stony, and commanded on three sides. Space for half a battalion under canvas. Wafer. —From a spring in the hill side about 300 yards N.-E. There are some rough stone troughs. 500 animals and 500 men could be supplied. Fuel. —Abundant. Fodder--Grass in spring and autur^n. Supplies. —Nil locally.14 Route No. 1—contd. 11 DASHT-I-ARJAN 12 m. General direction N.- 6 5 600'. N.-E. The path con- 134 m. tinnes to ascend the mountain side, which is covered with oak trees. Follows the telegraph line to mile 1, where it bifurcates. The old road still follows the telegraph line; it is longer, rougher, and less easy to traverse under opposition than the new road. This latter keeps to the N., and crosses the range at a point 2 miles to the W. of, and 200 feet higher than the telegraph track. The top of the Pir-i-Zan Kutal (TjbSOh is reached at mile 4. From mile 3 to mile 4 it is stony and steep, and in January and February is covered with snow 6 or 7 inches deep. At the top of the pass there are two small stone huts, used as tuf ingdii posts. The mountain ridge on the west side of the Pir i Zan Kutal rises abruptly to a height of about 7,900 / and this rocky crag is known as the “ Chang.’’ The northern side of the PIr-i-Zan mountain is steep and covered with oak trees. The track is a zigzag down the mountain side and very stony and trying for animals. The foot of the mountain (6,650') is reached at mile 5|. The Dasht-i-Arjan valley is about 9 miles long and 5 miles wide, surrounded by mountains on all sides. It is flat, open, and covered with grass. The centre of the valley and the eastern and southern sides are marshy and the water collects mainly in the south-eastern corner and its 'only outlet is by subterranean springs which find outlets in the Kazarun valley and which feed the Famur lake there. The track follows the western side of the valley, and is over open easy ground. At mile 7 (6,600') a ruined caravansarai is passed, where there is a spring of good water. At mile 9 pass Kaleh Mashiz, another ruined caravansarai, where there is a spring of good water. At mile 13 cross a stream where there are some willow trees and cultivation, close under the cliffs (500' high) which bound the N. side of the valley. Just beyond the village of Dasht-i-Arjan, the telegraph rest-house is reached at mile 14. Dasht-i-Arjan was a village of 800 inhabitants.

General direction E. 6,400'. Leaving the telegraph 145 m. house, the ascent of the Sineh Safid ridge commences. A good bridle path 10' wide was made in January 1919 by the South Persia Rifles. The ascent is gradual and easy. The hill side is covered with trees, mostly hawthorn, 15' high. At mile 2 the summit is reached (7,200'). Here there is a blockhouse, called the Burj-i-Timurl, wLich was mostly destroyed by the Kazarunis in September 1918. There is a small spring of good water 300 yards S. of this block-house. The descent is steep, and follows a spur composed of slate and shale. The bridle path is not difficult for laden animals. The foot of the Sinek Safid ridge is reached at mile 4 (6,550'). Here there is an old gendarmerie post, the Burj-i-Nau, badly sited, which was dismantled in 1917. The bridle path goes through low jungle, which lies between the Kara Aghach river on the N. side and low hills on the S. side. The going is practically level. At mile 7 pass another dismantled gendarmerie post on the hill side. At mile 101 cross the Kara Aghach river by a stone bridge. 100 yards long 23 feet wide. Usually the river contains not more than 1 to 2 feet of water, and the muleteers prefer to use the ford alongside the bridge. At mile 12 reach the large stone-built caravanserai of Khan-eh-Zinian. The village is half a mile further on, and alongside the village there is a small serai which is habitable, but not in good repair. The large caravanserai can accommodate 300 men and the smaller serai 100 men. The village contains 50 squalid houses, and about 210 inhabitants. Camping ground. —Unlimited.

Leaving the 165 m, saraiy the road crosses a bridge past the village and the other •sarai y and over a deep watercourse. The bridge is 63 yards long including ramped approach on W. side, 13 feet wide, paved with uncut stones, three brick and stone arches, span 13 feet, height to crown 15 feet. There is a ford on S. side of bridge, bad ap proaches, ford impassable immediately after rain. The road keeps along the left ba^k of the river, which commands the right bank. At 2 miles leave the river and strike across the valley, passing the village of Kaleh-Nau at 3£m. and making a short sharp ascent to a higher plateau at 4 m., where there is a good rear guard position for a force retiring on Shiraz. Thence the road gradually ascends with undu lations to the summit of the Mulla Khurneh pass; at 10 miles, just before the pass, there is a small well of good perennial water on S. of road, difficult to find. The descent on the far side is gradual over undulating stony ground, passing a spring at 11J miles, to the ridge on which Burj-i-Deh Shaikh stands at 12 miles. Here there is a gendarmerie block-house. Deh Shaikh village (or Kaleh Mushir) is on rising ground I J miles to N. of road. A force might camp near here by the river, instead of at Chinar Rahdar. W ater is excellent and abundant. No surai. After the tower the descent, through a defile about a mile long with hills both sides, is steeper to the level of the stream, called the Pul-i-Suyam, which is crossed at 15J miles by a masonry bridge, 40 yards long, 15|- feet wide, with a stone-paved roadway, centre of bridge 35 feet above water. A gendarmerie block-house is reported here. Road continues along the left bank, a track branching off S.-W. to Khaneh Khabis and Ohinar Fariab! At 18 miles is the stone bridge of Pul-i-Mianeh, 40 yards long, 14^ feet wide, with a paved roadway in bad repair; one arch. Thence the road follows the right bank of the stream where the going is bad and stony, to 20 miles where it again crosses by a one aiched stone bridge, faced with cement17 Route No. 1—contd. 9 40 yards long, 15i feet wide, roadway paved with cut stone blocks, approaches nearly at right angles to bridge.

From Zarghun to Qawam (bad during the winter and spring there is usually deep heavy mud, but for the rest of the year it offers no obstacle. The direct road between Qawamabad and Dehbld is only fit for mules and camels, and it would require extensive blasting operations to render it fit for wheeled traffic. The alternative route is however used by carriages. The remaining section between Dehbid and Isfahan is an excellent road over a gravelly plain with very few bad places. The fords across the Pulvar river become impassable for two or three days at a time in w ct w eather and in winter. The Kul-i-Kush pass is sometimes blocked by snow for two or three months at a time in winter. In this case cara vans branch off and go round by Hanashk, rejoining the main road at Khan-i-Khurreh. The physical obstacles are not of very great importance, so far as pack transport is concerned, in ordinary seasons, but in connection with wheeled transport the following may be noted :—• (i)Stage 15 .—Rough and steep gradients over the N’al- Shikan and the Gardan-i-Zarghim. These two passes, on account of their stony nature would require a large amount of labour to convert them into an easy road for wheels, but at the same time a certain amount of im provement would be effected by the removal of the larger rocks from the track. (m) Stage 17.—Ford across the Pulvar river, at the end of the Tang-i-Sivand. The ford is bad even for pack animals, but it is avoided by the detour to the E. which leaves the caravan route at Sivand. (Hi)Stage 18—The Tang-i-BuPki, text to route. The road could only be widened here by extensive blasting. ' (iv) Stage 19 .—The road is narrow and bad between miles 5 and 7 ascending over sharp jagged rocks. This w r ould require a considerable amount of labour to render it a good road. The road is narrow and bad in the descent to Khan-i-Kurgum. From the information at present available it is difficult to esti mate the amount of labour that would be required to improve this bit. c 220 Route No. l—eontd. . . Difficulties Nos. (n)&gt; (w) and (iv) are all avoided by the detour to the E. {vide end of route), but, at the same time, on account of the scantiness of the information, it is impossible to judge of the exact nature of the difficulties to be met with, and the prob able amount of labour required to improve them. {v) Stage 20 .—The road is narrow and bad in descent to Khan-i-Khurreh. This point would probably re quire much labour to make it into an easy toad. (vi) Stage 24 .—The descent into the Yazd-i-Khast ravine is dangerous for carriages or guns. As the banks of the ravine consist of conglomera te rock it would probably not be possible to construct a ramp down into it without a large expenditure of Labour. This cross ing, and the village of Yazd-i-Khast, can be avoided by a detour which crosses the ravine 3 to 6 miles to the E. of Yazd-i-KlYst, by which Amlnab^d is made the halting place, but information does not appear to show that the crossing is so much better than that at Yazd-i-Kh st, and it has the disadvantage of making the stage at least 12 miles longer. (vii) Stages 18, 19, and 20 are dangerous, on account of snow, in winter months. Wot?.—The road is comparatively secure for travellers, if armed, the most inrecure portions being that between Shiraz and Dehbid and from Abadeh to Maqsud Begi, when Turkish tribes are about in summer. The winter is fairly mild though on the passes there are often heavy falls of snow between December and March. At times there are heavy falls of rain which afreet the passability of the road In summer, although there is rarely excessive heat, the mid-summer months are hot, and it would be inadvisable to march lar^e bodies of troops between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. The plain between Zarghun and Pui-i-Khan during the summer months and up to the time of the autumn rams is infested with a small fly known as the Jifias Manas. This finds its way into the nostrils of animals and the quietest of animals become most violent xn their efforts to get rid of it. At Sfvand and Murghab there is invariably fever during the summer and autumn Animal sickness also prevails and often, causes the abandonment of certain portions of the road for a time. Water .—Water good and abundant at stages 15, 16 17 18 19, 21, 22, 24 and 26. ' Water of poor quality at stage 28. Up to Dehbid water is obtained on the march from streams. In stages 20, 21 and 24 no water en route ; in stage 25 only at Aminabvid ; in stages 23, 26 and 28 probably only obtainable at one or two villages or from the canal in stage 23 ; in stage 27 only in the first half of the march ; and in stage 22 no difficulty following details may be noted.21 Route No. l—&lt;ontd. At Hijdad —good but limited. At lUian-i-Kkurreh —bad ; drinking water for the men should be carried from Behbid. At Mehidr —water in cistern is bad ; water should be obtained from irrigation channels. At Marq —not good. Men’s drinking water should be brought from Mehlar. Fuel ,—From Shiraz to Slvand, particularly oyer the Marv- dasht, fuel is scarce near the road and timely notice would be necessary to collect it in large quantities at any particular point. Thence to Dehbid a fair amount within easy distance of the road and plentiful in the Tang-i-Bulaki. The gardens round Surmak and the villages on from thgre to Abadeh would furnish a plentiful supply. Very scarce from Abadeh to Yazd-i-Khast, but at the latter place a very plentiful supply from the gardens. Qumisheh and the villages round obtain wood from the fruit gardens and from the E. side of the mountains separating this portion of the country from the desert. From Qumisheh to Isfahan very scarce. dodder, rrom April to the end of June good grazing for all animals from Shire z to Dehbid. Camels find their own fodder for eight months and are fed from December to April. The Arab tribesmen find grazing for extensive flocks from May to Septem ber. Beyond Dehbid no information. Supplies .—Harvests vary considerably in Persia and enquiries should be made before attempting this march with any large body of troops. The.country depends entirely on its own resources for the ordinary necessaries of life, and the passage of a large force through it, drawing on the country, would in most places result in a famine. At Shir'z and Isfahan supplies for a division for some time. At stages, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 26 for a regiment with transport, and perhaps a larger force. At stages 24 and 25 for half a battalion with transport. . At stages 18, 19, 20, 23, 27 and 28 practically nil. The Mashed-i-Murghab district is a great grain-growing coun try : in any year following good harvest the supply of grain pro curable is abundant, even in mid-winter, as transport is never # available to take it away. The country round Dehbid is fertile, and although nothing can be procured in Dehbid itself, from the22 Route No. I— con'd.' district near, certainly 100,000 maunds of grain would Le pio- curable. In this district the crops are harvested in the middle of August and further south somewhat earlier. Most of the villages on the route have flocks of sheep and goats of from 50 upwards and generally a few cows. At Murghab a hundred head of cattle might be procured at any time. The larger towns, such as Shiraz, Abadeh, Qumisheh, and Isfahan could supply a certain amount of groceries. From Shiraz to Dehbid, and on this section of the road, supplies for 2,000 men and 1,000 animals should be available up to 6 months after the harvest. Beyond this to wards Isfahan the country is a poor one. In 1912 it was re ported that at most stages supplies were scarce or nil and that cultivation was much less than 0 formerly. The chief supply centres are—- Zarghun. Qadrabad. J Kinareh, Dehbid. Sivand. Surmak. Abadeh. Caravans consist of mules, camels and donkeys. At Sivand in the spring 300 mules could be hired for transport and at other times only 50. Up to Dehbid practically none could be hired or bought. After notice at Qumisheh 2,000 donkeys could be obtained and at Mayar 2,000 camels. Donkeys are obtainable in most of the villages in small numbers. In summer muleteers load up soon after midnight and at other times they march during the day. Daily amount of feed for a mule 6 lbs. barley, 20 lbs. hhoosa. A recognized mule-lo^d is 280 lbs. but it is often much more. Facilities for shoeing practically nil. One or two indifferent smiths at Zarghun and Sivand with little material. Alternative Stages .—• (а) Puzeh Zarghun to Kinareh.

(The distances are 194 m. taken from the British Consulate). At 2 miles Shiraz is left by the Kuran gate, which is reached from the Consulate by two roads, one through the bazar and the avenue of Deh-i-Buzurg and the other skirting round the city by the Bank garden. The two roads join near the gate way and near the road to the B5gh-i-Dilkusha. The latter road is not as broad as the former, but it avoids a high backed river bridge crossed by it, and is ordinarily followed by carriages going to the Bagh-i-Nau. The road then runs through the Tang- i-Allah-o-Akbar, a narrow ravine with the mountain of Murtaza Ali. on which is the well of the same name, rising abruptfy on the right, and the Babakuh on the left or west. The road is led along the side of the later. The mountains are impracticable except for infantry and mountain batteries. At 3 miles a spring of good water, the Ab-i Zangi, is passed about half a mile to the east of the road. From the top of the ascent, from the gateway, the road for about 300 yards crosses uneven sheet rock, and two carriages could hardly pass between the precipitous rock on one side and the low boundary v/all of the ravine on the other. At oj miles, a small domed building, the Ambrr-i-Chauzi, said to contain water, lies on the left of the road. The road here is frequently broken by water courses, but is passable for wheeled traffic. It then runs between two rocks, and is only 12 feet wide and very bad and stony. At 4 miles the hills begin to open out and the telegraph line crosses the road from lef^to right. At 4| miles pass Yakhchah the ice pits and eight houses with some vine cultivation. At 4| miles the Ab-i-Ruknl crosses the road, which then follows the stream to Gumbad-i-Sabz. Water is excellent and plentiful the whole vray. At 6 miles is the village of Akbajab d, where there is a caravanparai ; 40 houses ; crops-— wheat and barley about 98.000 ibs. The road now runs across24 Eoute No. I— contd. the Bajgah plain which is rough and stony, with some patches of rock, and passes a small weir, diverting a portion of the stream from the right to the left of the road : here it feeds a small tank from which an irrigation channel runs to the cultivation beyond. The country round here is stony, affording in the autumn a little, camel grazing, which becomes more plentiful in the spring. At 7f miles the entrance of the Bamu pass is reached ; the road here is very bad. At 8 miles the hills on the right recede slightly , affording a small camping-ground on the banks of the stream much used by caravans and nomads. This point lies about 800 feet higher than the Kuran gate. The road continues up the pass and at 8-| miles reaches Gumbad-i-Sabz, which consists of 20 mud houses occupied by road tufa ngchis. No supplies are obtainable here ; the water-supply is perennial, good, and plenti ful from the Ab-i-Rd kill. At 9 miles the carriage road branches off to the left. The caravan route keeps straight on, and, cross ing the Kutal just above this point, re-joins the carriage road on the other side near the foot of the mountain. The post road, at 91 miles running between the spurs from the mountains on either side, narrows to 15 feet, but opens out again at once, and, turning to the right, climbs the'Gardan-i-N'al Shikan, or Bamu, with an average slope of 4 or 5. The qardcm is reached at 9f miles about 300 feet higher than the camping-ground at Gum- bad-i Sabz. A graded road has been built for motors. At 10 miles the telegraph again crosses the road. At 10J miles ti e ' road turns \o the left and resumes its original direction and passes the caravansarai of Bajgah. This is a post, stage for carriages and post fourgons; it is generally accepted as 12 miles from Sluriz. The caravansarai is a stone and cement building, lined inside with burnt bricks, which is in good repair blocking the pass, and affording a strong defensive post, except against guns. Stabling for 200 horses. Supplies nil. Water is obtainable from a small spring of about 18 inches wide by a few inches deep ; it is sweet and clear, and is c ollected into a tank, some 11 feet square, for irrigation purposes: animals can be watered at the tank. Good grazing in summer for all animals and for camels all the year. Fuel plentiful, obtained from Kuh-i-Bamu. The road now runs across the B jgah plain, in which there is a little culti vation and sparse grazing in winter, the going here is very muddy and Heavy. ^ At 1 mile the ascent of the K*tal-i-Zar- ghun (or Gaidaneh-i-Ab Bank) commences. The average slope25 Koute No. I—contd. of the ascent is from 4 to 5. The top is reached at I| miles* The descent, which was very rough and bad, has now been built for motors. Carriages have the choice of two roads, which divide at the top of the pass, and join again in the valley at the foot of the mountain. The road gradually descending, con tinues down the valley to 2J miles; here the valley is about a half mile wide, but opens out to the S. E. At 3 miles a line of karezes crosses the road, arid a quarter of a mile further on is a qdvekkhaneh with steps leading down into an opening in the karez, from which good and abundant water is to be obtained perennially. Two hundred yards further on the stream emer ges from the Mrez and runs down the valley ; its banks are low and animals can be watered without any difficulty. The road now undulates over spurs from the hills on the left, the ground on the right falling away to the watercourse of the valley. At 5J miles the village of Dudak is passed about one mile on the right. At 7| miles a road to the left runs direct to the Puzeh Zarghun; avoiding the village of that name and shortening the distance to the Marvdasht plain by one mile. This road is suitable for ani mals and is followed by the telegraph line. At this point the mountains on the left cease. The post road continues over level country through cultivation to the large village of Zarghu n-— -—800 houses. The telegraph line is within sight of the road the whole way. The post road runs right through the bazar. There is a post house and horse stage here. Zarghun is a large unwall ed village with cMpdrkhdneh and earavansarai both in very bad repair. The outer walls of the houses are loopholed and are well adapted for defence. One hundred goats. Two hundred ponies. Tactically it permits of an army operating from the N. opposing aforce moving out from Shiraz. The Kutahi-Gumbad* i-Sabz and Kutai-i-Zarghun particularly afford a distinctly strong position. Route No. IV (g) connects here. Camping ground.—Unlimited but liable to inundation Troops should camp at the Puzeh Zarghun, 1J miles beyond the village. This avoids a detour. W ater. —Plentiful.

General direction N.* 5,600'. E * Leaving Zarghun 2 j 9.1 ^ the road runs Ai.“ W. for one mile, with the mountains rising abruptly on the right, and cultivation on the left, to the Puzeh Zarghiinj where it enters the Marvdasht plain. At the puzeh is a well of good perennial water and a qdvehkhaneh. The short cut from the last stage which avoids • Zarsfhun rejoins the post road here. At the n puzeh the road bifurcates. One road follows the line of the mountains to the Band Amir, where it crosses the river of that name. The other, which is the post road, runs N.-E.. across the Marvdasht plain to the bridge of Pul- i-Khi.n. The former road is used by caravans in winter when the plain to the S. of the river is swampy in places. The post road runs across the Marvdasht plain. The mountains turn to the N.-E. and bound the plain on that side. Cultivation continues on both sides of the road for a few hundred yards, when the road again bifurcates. The right hand track, which is used in dry weather* cuts off a considerable corner. The main road continues on until it reaches the first of a series of eight causeways, 11 feet broad, and in bad repair, where it bears to the right. The causeway is known as the Pul-i-Khurdeh. By these causeways the road is led across the marshy ground which is formed here by rain in wet weather; they are in a wretchedly dilapidated state and quite impossible for wheels. The two tracks join each other on approaching the bridge of Pul-i-Khan which is reached at 6^ miles. About a hundred yards before reaching the bridge the road turns sharp to the left round the end of a rocky ridge which here rises from the plain, and runs N.-W. parallel to the river, commanding the bridge and its approaches from either side. The approach to the bridge between the river and the ridge is at right angles. The roadway of the bridge is stone paved and only 12 J feet wide. The bridge has a very steep pitch up to and down from the crown, the slope from the right bank being 9 and that down to the left bank 12. Much delay to troops and transport would have to be allowed for as certain to occur here. The bridge is of stone with three arches, the curves of which are of brick : height of central one above normal flow 16 feet. The parapet is three feet high. The river, though27 Route No. Y-—6®nld. elsewhere sluggish, here runs strongly. The fall from the Fuzete Zarahun to the river bank is only 75 feet. Leaving the bridge the road runs through a cutting for 250 yards, on the which the Pulvar river flows, at this point slowly, 25 feet wide with banks 20 feet high. The Pulvar river, which joins the Band Amir above the bridge, bends in towards the road here. From the cutting the road runs across the plain, which, on this side of the river, is much cultivated, and intersected with numerous irrigation channels. At 11 miles reach Amirabad, which is a changing post for horses. The caravan track leaves Amirabad about 11 miles to the left, and continues N. -E. to 17 J miles, where a branch road runs to the village of Kinareh 1J miles distant. This village is generally used as a halting place by travellers. The post waggons, however, usually follow the main road to the choLperklianeh at Pazeh-Takht-nJamshid, '‘and marching troops would do better to camp at the puzeh, thus avoiding a detour to the village. There .is excellent water about J mfle from the road on the path wdiich leads up to Persepolis. The water is from a running qanal and can be drunk without boiling as it issues from the ground here. Supplies ^can be brought from Xinareh. There is no firewood at the pv.zeh. The road to the village continues over the level plain- and crosses^the deep irrigation canal to the village canal which supplies Kinareh with water by a wood and mud bridge* unfit for heavy traffic. It is made of six 15-feet poplar poles covered with'.reeds and mud. Kinareh and ’AH bad are practically one village, about 300 mud houses. There is a walled garden to the west in which is a bald khdneh. Five hundred goats ; 60 cow s. Donkeys 500. The aver age length of the stage from the previous reports is 20 miles. The road at this stage is level throughout, and in dry weather presents no obstacle to the ordinary rate of marching except as noted at the Pui-i-Khan. In wet weather the road being unmetalled becomes heavy, and transport and artillery would be delayed. The section near the causewmys is quite impass able for wheels in winter. S. of the Band Amir river the plain also becomes marshy in wet weather, and impassable for traffic except by the causeways. The flood may possibly take 5 or 6 days to subside during which time the road is impassable. Troops c«dd move across the plain anywhere in dry weather, but N. of’the river the numerous irrigation channels would# 28 Route No. I— contd. compel artillery and wheeled transport to move by the road. The Band Amir river flowing from N.?W. to S.-E. cuts the Marvdasht plain in two, and offers a line of resistance at which to oppose the advance from, or on, Shiraz.

As the road approaches the puzeh, it is joined by the direct road, which avoids Kinareh, but they separate again at the ford. • The post road keeps under the hills to the east of the river, vide alternative route No. I (P). The ford is 30 yards wide, and 2 feet deep, with a gravelly bottom. The breadth and depth depend on the season of the year and on the amount of the rainfall. The descent down to, and ascent from the ford are fair, but would require slight repair in places for guns and wheeled transport; the spade work would be easy. The road now enters the plain of Khafrak. At 3'J miles the tract turns N.-W. and soon after again meets the river, and runs above it at a height of 30 feet for some 200 yards. The track here is only eight feet wide in places, with low mounds on the left. The road then leaves the river and runs through cultiva tion to Hajiibad, which is reached at miles. The road in this section would be heavy in wet weather. Throughout the last mile it is bounded on the left by a deep irrigation channel passable at frequent places for laden mules and donkeys. There is one ford* across it and two bridges of mud and logs, the latter being only 3 feet wide. The numerous irrigation channels around this \ ill age would cause considerable delay to pack transport in any numbers. H jrVb~d is a mud walled village; 200 cows; 100 goats ; 100 donkeys.

The mountains are naked rock, in many places unclimbable, and altogether difficult. Half way a small village is passed under the mountains ; deserted in summer. A quarter of a mile further on the shrine and village of manizadeh is passed 350 yards to the right of the road The road then turns the Puzeh and runs W. of N. across a small plain down the Sivand valley to the ford at the village of Dashtabad ; a small village with few supplies, except, perhaps, just after the harvest. The track at this corner is very narrow, passing between a deep irrigation channel on the right, and another at toe foot of the mountains to the left. Delay to transport would occur here, and it would be most difficult to construct a carriage road owing to the difficult nature of the ground. The ford at Dashtabad is, in summer, about 1 j feet deep, with a gravelly bottom. The approaches on either side are very bad. The ford is dangerous when the river is flooded, one or two accidents having happened during late years. On the right bank, or Dashtabad side, a deep irrigation channel has first to be crossed by a narrow bridge of earth and logs ; the track then turns along the bank of the irrigation channel, with a drop to the bed of the river on its right. From the bank it descends steeply to the ford. The ascent on the Sivand side is steep, and a small irrigation channel has to be crossed by a log bridge at the top. Here the caravan route rejoins the motor road. From this point a good road undulates down the N.-E. side of the valley, the mountains sending down a succession of spurs which form deep re-entrants between them. On the left the ground falls gently to the river, which runs for the greater part of its course down the centre of the valley and under the mountains on the far side. The valley, which is about a mile broad, is bounded on both sides by mourn tains, those on the S.-W. being precipitous. In the latter part of the stage the road runs through cultivation, bounded by an irrigation channel on the left. A block to transport would be likely to occur at the village where the road is narrow and enclosed by houses. The village is built on the slopes of the high rocky hills which bound the valley, and is the head ;uar- ters of many of the charvadars who work on this section of theso Route No. I— eontd. road.

From Foz.eh-nt'akht-i- Jamshid where it leaves the post road, to Dashtabad, the roa is a sandy track, presenting no obstacle for pack amm.als except as noted. From the ford to SIvand the road is fair and fit lor passage of all arms, but heavy after rain. The fords over the Pulvar river are sometimes impassable for three or our c uys u a time in wet weather.

From Sivand the road 2521 m. continues N.-E., up the valley bounded on either side by precipitous mountains. Gradually narrowing at 2b miles, the valley turns to the N.-E., the road at the same place crossing the river by a ford. on The motor road keeps to the right round the spur the Sivand side and does not touch Qawamabad. It skirts the hills and passes through Sa'adatabad and the Tang-i- Kamln. The ascent on the Qavamabad side is fair. The crossing itself is bad, and in flood time a ford some 150 yards lower down is used, or sometimes a ford higher up the river is used, which is reached by keeping to the right under the mountains and past the ruined masonary bridge by which the river was formerly crossed. All tliree fords are in winter sometimes impassable for a day or two at a time. The ford is commanded by an amphitheatre of mountains on the Qawmn- abad side, while the approach from that place is similarly com manded by those on the Swand side. Beyond this the road is wide, and the going is fair over sandy ground, although cut in places by nal .v running down to the river.

This village is enclosed with high walls having brick towers, and its only gateway faces S. immediately in front of the gardens, also walled, of the Qawarn-ul-Mulk. There is a spacious ;caravanserai in a good state of repair and a chapir» khdneh, to the W- of the village. Water is good and the supply is practically inexhaustible from an irrigation channel and the river, but if drinking water be drawn from the former it should be taken at a point to the E. of the village. Animals should he watered at the river. Fifty houses, population 250. Sup plies scarce. The road here turns N.-E. between the caravan serai and the chavarkhaneh, and then turning E. again runs at the foot of the high mountains forming the northern boundary of the valley, which, from the ford, has opened out, affording, except where cultivated, camel and goat grazing. An alterna tive road from the village runs parallel to the main road for a distance of some two miles, rejoining it at the gardens of Qaw amabad. These gardens, situated on the right of the main road, are watered by an irrigation channel brought from the river, the channel also working a mill in the gardens. The water is good and plentiful. The banks of the river where it runs along-side the road, being only a few inches above the water, afford an; excellent place for watering transport animals. Leav ing the gardens, the villages of Rahatabad and Vakiiabad are to be seen about one and a half to two miles away to the right front across the Kalilak plain, into which the valley opens out. Two miles beyond the gardens the road runs N.-E. round a spur of the mountains and enters a narrow valley covered with a thin jungle of thorn trees, down which flows the Pulvar river. The post road and caravan track here divide, the former turn ing S.-E. just inside the mouth of the valley, runs Sa’- adatabad, and rejoins the caravan track 8 miles S. of Lehbid. The valley now gradually narrows until it reaches a iufang- chi tower at the entrance to a narrow gorge, known as the Tang-i-Kamin. The road then winds to the left and runs along a track on the face of the hill with the river on its right. The passage is very bad and quite impassable for guns or wheel ed transport. This point could only be improved by blasting, and it would involve much delay for a force of any size. After32 Route No. I—bonm. ■winding right and again left, the road runs down a broad valley for two and a quarter miles, when another difficult passage between the river and a spur of the hills is encountered, the passage of which would involve further delay for the passage of troops. From here the road continues for about a mile and a half commanded by mountains on both, sides, after which the valley through which the road runs makes a right angled turn to the left. The road at the point where this turn is made is difficult. From this point on to the plain of Mashed-i- Murghab the road runs through a gorge known as the Tang-i- Bulaki, which has a width of from 200 to 600 yards, flanked by perpendicular cliffs in places. From May until October, according to report, the whole of this gorge is infested with gad flies to such an extent that frequently animals are seen coming but of it dripping with blood. During this period it is only possible to travel with comfort at night. At two miles further on the road passes through a narrow gallery cut in the rock overhanging the river, which flows through the rough gorge on the right of the road; this gallery is too narrow for wheeled transport. An alternative track can here be taken by descend ing into the bed of the river and fording the stream instead of entering the gallery. Subsequently the river is forded a second time, the two tracks reuniting at the entrance to the Mashed- i-Murghab plain. This river route is impassable when the river is in flood. Beyond the gallery the gorge begins to open out, and the river, as it emerges from the gorge into the plain, turns nearly at right angles along the mountains forming its western boundary. The gallery route, keeping under the moun tains on the left, crosses a small nald and emerges on to the plain, . where it is rejoined J&gt;y the alternative track from across the stream. The united road then runs across -the plain to the small village of Takht-i-Madar-i-Sulaiman, near which, on the left of the road, stands the ancient sarcophagus, reputed to be the tomb of the mother of Solomon, or, according to modern authorities, the tomb of Cyrus the Great. Continuing over the plain the road passes the ruins of Fasargardae, and then ascends a low ridge with a steep ascent, where some difficulty might be experienced by guns or wheeled transport. Descending the far side of the ridge Deh-i-hau is reached, a small village situated in the angle of some low hills. The telegraph line runs within sight of theRoute Xo. I~--confd.

Across the Mashed-i-Murghab plain the mad, though fair in good weather, is sandy and would become bad with much traffic, and in wet weather the going would be heavy.

Beyond the top of the otss the road presents no difficulties as far as the junction with the Mashed-i-Murghab road at miles. From this pom , however there is a very stiff ascent winding between low hills and over sharp and slippery rocks, to the top of another pass, thich is reached at a little over 9| miles. Two tracks lead down the*descent, one which leads straight on, Very bad and very difficult to improve ; the other branching off to the left along the telearaph line is also very bad and rocky, but could be improv ed vith considerable labour. Both tracks unite again about 600 yards beyond the foot of the descent, the one which kept straight on from the kutal having made a left-handed turn, and followed the dry water course at the foot of the pass. le read along the valley is fairly good, though wery stony m places ; it is bounded on the right (E.) at some 200 to 400 yards by a ranoe of mountains between which, and the road, is a dry water course On the left the country is more open, but is broken bv low isolated hills, and by spurs from the main ridge at a distance of over 4,000 yards. The road keeps along the valley, but gradually ascending till it reaches the foot of the beyond which the road leads down on to the plain on which is situated the caravansarai of Khan-i Khurghan. The ascent of the Tcutal is stony but passable for all arms ; the top is reached 12' ivik's. For the first mile and a half .the descent lies be tween two ranges, 200 yards apart. The road is stony and in places so rocky as to be, in its present condition, impassable for wheeled traffic. The descent is steep with an extremely nasty right-handed turn, and neither descent nor turn can be avoided. To improve it sufficiently to admit of the passage of guns and wheeled traffic would probably necessitate a day’s work by a battalion of pioneers. At 13f miles the track bifur cates, uniting again on the plain at the bottom of the pass. There is little to choose either in condition or distance between these two tracks. The road then runs N.-N.-W. across the plain to the bridge of Khan-i-Khurghan, a distance of just under a mile. The road from the foot of the pass runs along some 400 yards from the foot of the mountains on the left (S.-W.). The35 Route No. I— contd.

The road crosses the river by a high-backed bridge of five arches. The roadway of the bridge is stone-paved, 21 feet w de and 72 yards long. The approach on the Khan-i- Khurghan side is cut by an irrigation channel running parallel with the river, crossed by a log and mud bridge. There is also a pond above the bridge. The stream is about 15 yards wide and about a foot deep. The water rise§ in winter, and the river is at times unfordable for a day at a time. The caravansarai. a stone building, is in very bad repair ; the village lies to the right of the road, some 200 and 400 yards, respectively, from the bridge. There are a few goats, but no other supplies. On leaving the bridge the road runs through cultivation to a small stream, a few inches deep, crossed by a masonry foot-bridge, just beyond which, a mile from Khan-i-Khurghan bridge, a short ascent leads to the upper plain. The road here is bad, crossing several nails, and slightly ascending. It con tinues across the plain to 21J miles, where the present carriage road, which runs vii Sa’adatab -d joins it from the S.-E. Just above the junction a small spring of good water, which however contains leeches, feeds an irrigation channel crossing the road. The latter, still ascending and fairly good though stony and broken by ndlds, reaches the top of the ridges enclos ing the Dehbid plateau on the S., at 26 miles. This forms the second line of a strong position commanding the approach from Khan-i-Khurgan, the first line being the outlying range of low hills, a mile and three-quarters further S. through which the road has run. The descent to Dehbid by an excellent road is easy, and cultivation on either side of the road begins almost immediatelv after leaving the kutal. The last mile is almost t/ CO t level. A tributary of the Pulv’r is crossed just before arriving at Dehbid, which is reached at 29 miles. Dehbid is the name of a group of seven villages, of which Daulat'brd, where the tele graph station, caravansarai, and chdpdrkMneh are situated, is usually known as Dehbid. The caravansarai consists of a new and large stone building. There are also telegraph buildings whete the Inspector of the Abadeh-Shlraz Section of the tele graph line lives.

No supplies; good water from a karez or qandt. Still erossing rising ground, the road, at 3f miles, reaches the first of the spurs from the foot of the mountain on the left (W.), which here stretches far out into the plain. After crossing the undulating ground formed by these spurs, the road continues over barren undulating country up a valley between low hills, till, at 10 miles, it crosses a low gardan with a ruined tuf angrMs tower on the right of the road. Descending, the road runs to the Qull Kush pass, the top of which is reached at 11 miles. The road through this pass has been cleared for motors. The descent from the pass on the north side is steep. The road follows the bed of a nala, with hills rising steeply on either side, until just before the Kuh-i-Jang!is reached at 14| miles. Pea v- ing the nidi, the road, keeping theKah-i-Jangl on the right (E.), runs over the lower slopes of the mountains on the left, crossing several dry nilis now prepared for motor traffic.

On the left are low hummocky hills with spurs and undulations lying in front of a steep rocky range to which they afterwards give place. In the first four miles the road, which is gradually descending, crosses seven shallow watercourses, running from left to right. At 5 miles the telegraph line, which up to this point has been on the left of the road, crosses to the right. Three-quarters of a mile further on, an isolated hillock is passed, followed by a second on the left of the road. At just over 8|~ miles, the telegraph line again crosses the road, and remains on the left as far as Surmak. Two more isolated hillocks are then passed on the left. The road now runs under the Kah-i-Chargan on the right (N.-N.-E.) of the plain. From this point to the 19th mile the plain is narrowed by a series of rocky ridges running on the right parallel to the toad, and situated between the latter and the main chain of mountains previously bounding the plain on that side. A curi ous line of low isolated rocky hillocks stretches here to the left across the plain. For the next four and a half miles the descent is steeper. The road continues under the rocky ridge, till at about 15J- miles it passes a hill on its left which continues for about a mile. The ridge on the right now ceases, disclosing another ridge behind, some 1,000 yards distant, (this is not the main ridge bounding the valley) also running roughly parallel to the road. As the hill on the left ends, the rocky ridge on the right commences again.

These folds are not sufficiently steep to interfere with traffic on the road, but troops moving across the plain might in places have to alter direction in order to avoia them. The descent into the ravine’is very steep, running down the face of the cliff to the bottom. At the foot of the descent it keeps under the cliff, above the right bank of the stream, which flows down the valley, until the caravanserai is reached at 20 miles. The village of Yazd-i-Khast occupies the whole of the summit of a conglomerate spur running out from the northern cliffs of the ravine for a distance of some 300 yards ; its walls rising straight up from the perpendicular sides of the spur. The town is now nearly de serted, the majority of the inhabitants occupying the new town built on the S. W. of the gate of the old town. A shallow ditch at the foot of the walls, crossed by a bridge of logs and mud, has been cut across the spur to the ravine on the north-western side of the spur up which side the road runs. The only entrance to the village is across this bridge. Population 2,500. Livestock 3,000 goats ; 100 cows. With the exception of a few donkeys there are no transport animals. &lt; . ..y There is a stone caravanserai on the S. side of the ravine, ' and a chaparkMneh on the N. side, where post horses are ob tainable.

General direction N. crosses the stream by a bridge, which, though broken, can still be used by transport animals and men. The stream below the bridge is about a foot deep with a gravel bottom, and is said by the inhabitants, probably truly, to be always fordable. The road then crosses the bed of the ravine, here about 450 yards broad, by a raised causeway to the foot of the s ur on which the village stands. Here on the right (E.) of the road is the chaplrkh neh. The road turns sharp to the left round the spur, running up the ravine between it and the bank of the nala. The ascent, though steep and stony, is passable for all arms. At the top of the ravine the road turns to the right (N.) and, getting clear of the buildings at once, runs past a mosque on to the plain. The track is here 38 yards broad, and is pass- abie for all arms, as also is the plain on either side. At 1 mile is a triangle of hills known as the Tal Balal, about 400 yards distant on the left of the road which it commands, as also the surrounding country.

There is a masonry caravan serai, rebuilt 1908, outside the village with a water tank in front of it; also a chdpdrkhaneh where post-horses can be obtained. The road to Maqs diieg t leads past the c ut par- . ki.dne , All arms could move in any direction over the plain on ■ either side of the road. At 21 miles, some ruins are passed, and the village of B gh JSurkh lying some half a mile to the left. Half a mile further on the caravans irai, a mud building m a bad state of repair, of Mirab d is reached, the village from which it takes its name being off the road to the E. From here the road continues through cultivation to the village of Maqs d Begi, at 22J miles, situated one hundred yards to the left of the road. Maqs'd Begl is a walled village said to have some 1,200 inhabitants. There is a guest-house for important travellers ; a caravanserai in bad repair and a chap rkhaneh all on the right (E.) of the road opposite to the village. Live- stock—300 goats; 70 cows. Probably a few donkeys would be the only transport animals available. Except at the village of Amin b d and on approaching the village of Maqstid Begi, the road, broad and good, runs across the plain. It gradually descends the whole way, except at the Tal-i-Gard-i-Gird. There is nothing to interfere with the usual rate of marching.

An ’ alternative route branches to the left here, skirting the village and running rid Kashareh, to within three-quarters of a mile of Qumisheh, where it rejoins the post road. The road o2Boute No. I— contd. is broad and good, with a plain on the right and gardens, cultivation, and level ground on the left. On the right the plain is bounded by a high range of rocky mountains, some mile and a half away, which gradually get nearer the road as it approaches Qumisheh. Continuing over smaller country, Dahak is passed on the left (W.) at 3f miles. At 5| miles the mill of Sular is passed, the village of that name lying a mile and a quarter to the W.-S.AV. The broken walls round tne culti vation confine the road on the left about half a mile further on, and continue for a mile when another mill is passed. The road from the mill, broad and good, though furrowed in places by watercourses from the hills, runs to 1 2-1 miles, where it bifur* cates, one branch running to Qumisheh, the other keeping N. under the hills. The former, turning more to the west over the plain, crosses, after another half mile, the which has been from 500 to 200 yards on the W. of the road since leaving Sular and which has turned N, by a stone bridge, 3 arches. 6 yards broad, and 65 yards long, with no parapet. The road way is 15 feet above the ndld bed. Fields and cultivation now on either side of the road. At 13} miles the alternative road from Maqsud Begl rejoins, and a deep hare: where delay to traffic may be expected, is crossed by a narrow earth cause way. There is a camping ground here, and to the E. of the town where water is plentiful. The road, about 20 feet wide, now winds between banks and walls, or is sunk below the level of the cultivation on either side. A quarter of a mile further on, a stone bridge of one arch, 3} yards broad and 17 yards long, leads across another ndld with perpendicular banks. The gate of the town is reached at 14} miles. The telegraph line crosses the road at the second bridge and runs N. outside the walls of the town. There is no other means of crossing the second ndld except by the bridge, and there is no ford and no possibility of making one without great labour, as the banks are perpendicular and some 15 feet high. A turning from the branch road also leads to the town. 'Qumisheh is a large walled town, the seat of a governor; with bazars, caravanserais, chdpdrkhdneh ; post horses can be obtained.

The road leaves the town by the gate N. of the eastern corner of the walls and runs, bounded by alternat ing walls and banks, through cultivation for nearly a mile, when it crosses a ncdd by a stone bridge of one arch, the roadway of which is four yards wide and 20 yards long ; height above the ndl i about 20 feet; the arch is elliptical, the upper part of the curve being brick ; the parapet is 21 feet high. The n la can also be crossed by a very steep track which, however, could not be used by wheeled transport or guns. There is an awkward turn to the right on leaving the bridge on the N. side. A quarter of a mile further on a second nald is crossed by a bridge, also of stone, with one elliptical arch, the crown of which is of brick. The roadway is 5i yards broad ; 16 feet above the ndl 1 bed ; and the parapet is 2 feet high. Delay in transport would occur at both bridges. There is an db-amb ir on the W. of the road. The road from the bridge continues throu. h culti vation till, at 1J miles, it skirts the puzeh of the mountain, on itslefb(W 7 .) and then passes through the graveyard of Qumisheh, situated on its lower slope. The road, which up to this point has been dusty, narrow, and indifferent, and which would become verv bad with much traffic, here widens to 9 vards and the goiig improves. At 1| miles the road passes between the buildings of the tomb and hamlet of Shah RUa. Adjoining the tomb, which is on the W. of the road, there is a pilgrim caravanserai standing well back. The village contains 400 houses. Telegraph line crosses from the E. to W. From here46 Eoute No. l—contd. until the thgparlctdndi of Aslab Chah is reached, there is no water to be obtained close to the road, which continues through cultivation for some distance. At 3J miles the road to r Isfahan, Ispaeh and Kasrlbad, branches off to the right front. The road now enters a broad plain, bounded by mountains. All arms could move across the plain, though it is somewhat broken by riilas* On the left the ground slopes up to the rocky mountains. At 7 miles the village of Ispeh is passed, about a mile to the right (E.). At a little over*8 miles a dry watercourse, running from the mountains, crosses the track. This forms no obstacle at the road or to the left of it, but might interfere with the movement of guns at places to the right. At 9 miles there is cultivation on the right, about 20 yards away. Here the mountains, rocky and unclimbable, are about one mile to the left and gradually recede. At 1T| miles two rocky hills rising at right angles to, and half a mile from, the road on the right (E.) command it, and at 12 miles the chaparJcMneh of Asiab Chah is reached. Here there is a mill and a plentiful supply of water. The mill shaft is 10 yards in circumference, and is said by the miller to be 40 feet deep ; this is kept full of water from the karez, which also has an overflow channel with a stream of rapidly flowing water 3 inches deep and 1 foot wide. Supplies practically nil. Post horses obtainable. The ch pirlchuneh has been rebuilt (October 1906) and has half a dozen small rooms for travellers. Erom here the road conti nues K.-ISThW., 1 across the plain, commanded by a low rocky range on the N.-N.-E. Three quarters of a mile further on a low gravel hill at an angle of about 45° rises on the left and commands the road ; isolated rocky ridges, some 3,000 yards to the left, lie about half-way between it and the main range of mountains bounding the plain on the N.-W. The road is broad and good ; much wet would make it soft, but it dries quickly. At 18?- miles a conical hill rising from the plain is passed, 1,300'yards, to the PI.-N.-E. The Icafez which supplies Asl b Ch ui issuing from the ground forms a stream flowiiig to wards Meho r r at varying distances from the road, its course being clearly marked oy the trees growing along it.

From the caravan- 456f m. serai of Mehlar, the road runs through ruined walls to the village of Mehl ir. A rocky range on the left (S.-W.) and an isolated mountain on the right (N.-E.) from the mouth of the valley in which Mehlar is situated. The road skirts the wail of the village, and then runs down the valley, for a distance of nearly two and a quarter miles from the caravanserai, when the end of the rocky spur in which it finishes is passed. The mountain can be climbed here, and men could move along the top to the S.-E. end. which commands the ap proach to Mehi r from As'ab Ohlh. The telegraph line is close on the left of the road to which it has crossed from the right, and continues along the road to the Urchin pass, when it follows the caravan track across the kutal. The valley is now .very broad (5 to 7 miles), and the road runs through a shallow cutting lower than the surrounding country, but the ground on either side is fit for the passage of all arms. At Tf miles a shallow nail is crossed, which ends on the left side of the road. This n il i. might interfere with the movement of guns across country, as in places they might have to change direction in order to cross it. A little more than a quarter of a mile further on there is a ruined mud building on the left of the road, and the ruined caravanserai, deserted burj, and cklpwrleh 'neh, of Ahmad- ab id are reached at 0.| miles. (The desertion of the village is believed to have been due to the water of the well having become brackish.) The chdp'rJchmeh, where post horses can be obtained, of Chib Ism ula’ is passed at a little over 11 miles Here there is a well of good water fed by a Iczrsz which becomes muddy after rain. The mountains on the right (E.) have now approached the road to within about 500 yards. From the cMpwkh iwh the road begins to ascend gradually; at 12 miles a spur from the48 Route No. 1—contd. hills on the right comes down to the road, which three quarters of a mile further on bends to the right and enters the Urchin Pass. Sharply ascending, the road runs between rocky hills, the sides of which are for the most part perpendicular but climbable in places up an occasional spur or water channel.i After the pass is entered, there is a hundred yards of stony level ground on either side of the road, and a road which runs from the W. and comes in under the mountains bounding the northern side of the entrance of the pass joins the post road. The caravan route and telegraph line branch left (N.-N.-W ) at 13 miles up a small valley, and then crossing the ridge to the N. rejoin the post road which runs round by the pass. Wheeled artillery should follow the post road. The Kutal-i-Urchln thus crossed is very steep. Guns might possibly be man-handled over with great difficulty. It is, however, considered impracticable. Three-quarters of a mile further on the pass narrows to a valley, down which runs a dry watercourse. All movement is confined to the road, which is only 12 feet wide. At 15 miles, the water course turns to the left, and the road keeping straight on ascends it, still between hills which come down on either side, until a low gardan * crossed. The road, just after beginning to wind round the mountain where there is a very nasty hit of around i ! ,a ^ reck J Comin § through the soil, enters a levelVaUev about 400 yards wide, hounded on the right by three isolated conical hills, with another valley behind them. At the third hill a dry watercourse is crossed. At the top of the short rise on ic far side the valley continues at a higher level. The hills Znl ^ a K nOW , a hundred y ards away, and on the left 400, the latter being low and broken. All arms could move across the plain here.

Leaving the ^69 m. chapctrlrTianeh at Marq, the road continues across the plain, which on the right (N.-E.) of the road is marshy and impassable in spring, but which is said to be passable for the rest of the year. The road soon becomes a mere track, but troops would not be greatly impeded as the plain is fairly level, and going- fairly good and the marshy land mentioned does not run up to the road. On the left the plain is bounded by high rocky mountains, which at 1J miles turn abruptly to the W. flanking a broad valley which runs into a plain at right angles to it. All arms can move across the plain between the road and the mountains. At If miles the road becomes broad and good again, and at miles the telegraph line crosses it from right to left and runs to the left front (N.-W.) over the plain to a low off-shoot of the Kuh-i-Sufeh, which it crosses. It then continues across the plain on the other (nc rthern) side, on which Isfahan stands, to the river ; this is crossed by the bridge known as the Pul-i-’AH VardI Khan, and so enters the city. Three tracks running across the plain lead from the post road to Kaleh Shur. The last of these, the one at the foot of the hills, being the Isfahan-Kaleh Shur road. These three tracks cannot be used in spring when the plain is swampy. The hills are entered at 4^ miles, and all movement, except for infantry and mountain guns, is confined to the road, by the low hills on either side of it, which ascend gradually to the gardan of Azar Durar. The ascent is easy, but at places the road narrows to 12 feet, and delay would be certain if traffic was not carefully regulated. An db-ambdr is passed on the left of the road, soon after leaving the gardan, the water of which is plentiful and said to' be good. The road runs between low hills similar to those confining the road during the ascent. Half-way M5ICGS50 Route No. I — concld. down there is a spring of water rising under a brick canopy form ing a small pool, which affords a good watering place for animals. Just before the foot of the pass is reached, a /* citc? containing water is crossed. From the foot of the pass the road runs across the plain to the cemetery of Isfahan, from where a broad road leads to the city, entering it by the bridge of Shah ’Abbas. The road, except for the ascent and descent of the low spur of the Kfdi- i-Sufeh crossed by the gardan of Azar Durar, runs across plains the whole way. Leaving the caravqnserai of Marq it is a good broad road, but it shortly becomes a mere track. As pointed out above, this will not affect the rate of marching to any great extent, as the plain on either side is fairly level and would afford good going. After a mile and a half the road becomes broad and good again, and continues so to the hills. The ascent is easy and the road fair, but in places it narrows to 12 feet. The descent is also easy by a fair road. Once on the Isfahan plain there is nothing to check the ordinary rate of marching, though passing through the cemetery the road is in places narrow.

Portions of it might be available for wheeled vehicles. The physical obstacles along this route are less numerous and much less formidable than those on the post-road. The passes, with the exception of Tang-i-Bahush, do not present any severe difficulty for infantry or cavalry. The rivers, if native report which described them in winter as unfordable be true, might prove more serious. The road may be divided into three sections.— The first section, i.e., the first two stages, viz,, to Ahram, 25J miles, is almost a dead level and might easily be traversed by wheeled vehicles. The country is open and practicable for all arms. The ground is Hable.to become heavy after rain, particularly the first stage. The Ahram river, if in flood, might prove trouble some. Between ’All Changi and Buneh Gaz the deep fine sand would much impede heavy vehicles. The second section, *.e., stages 3 to 8 inclusive, Ahram to Kavar Serai, a distance of about 144 miles, is a gradual rise over a country intersected by mountains, valleys, and rivers, by a series of passes of which the principal are the Tang-i-Bahush, TangAb, Gardaneh-i-Siah, and Muk, the highest point being at the top of the last named pass (about 6,600 feet). None of the passes are as formidable as the kwlals on the post road ; the Tang-i-Bahush would be distressing for cavalry, and very difficult (Mr. Grahame arid Major Brandel are inchned to think impracticable) for artil lery. The third section, i.e., from Kavar Sarai to Shiraz, about 35 miles, is over fairly level open country. This portion of the road would be practicable for all arms. The last stage is apt to be heavy after rain. The principal obstacles would be— (a) The Ahram river. The crossing of this, a few miles before reaching Ahram (stage 2), and again immediate ly on leaving that place (vide stage 3), might prove difficult in the winter or early spring if the river were in flood. The road is sometimes closed for a month after rain when the inhabitants go to Ahram56 Koute No. I (C)— contd. via Chahkutah or Borazjun. Beyond Ahram there is no alternative. (6) The long march up the stony Tang-i-Bahush, between Ahram and Bushkan, is very trying to man and beast, and would be more so if there were much water in the torrent. (c) Stage 5. The crossing of the river Du Chang, and of a larger river about 14i miles east of Bushkan, and of several deep ndlds, might prove troublesome. This march is a most fatiguing one. (d) Stage 6. This is a long march with a tedious ascent of the Tang-i-Bizan. . (e) Stage 7. The Tang-Ab pass with the frequent crossings of the torrent. (/) Stage 8. The stiff ascent of the Muk pass. Between the 15th November and the 15th March this tract of country is liable to be occasionally visited by heavy rains. In December 1903 the \Ala-ud-Douleh, marching up from Bushire to Shiraz with a large of body of men, lost four or five of the escort from exposure and cold. In the beginning of December 1904 the Ahram river in con sequence of heavy rains rose in flood, carrying away many houses and drowning many people. Wet weather rather than any excessive cold is to be looked for during the winter months. According to native information the passes are never blocked by snow, but the rivers are often impracticable. In the summer months, of which July and August are hottest, marches would have to be made by night. Water. The prevalent notion that this route lacks water would appear to be erroneous or grossly exaggerated. The water, as fai as Firazabad (stage 6), is generally brackish, though not so much so as to make it unfit for animals. There are a certain number of springs and wells of drinking water sufficient for a regiment. From Firazabad to Shiraz water is good and plentiful. Leather buckets and ropes for drawing water from the wells, some of which are very deep, would have to be carried.

Supplies .-—Supplies of fodder and forage are, according to native information, more plentiful on this route than on the post-road. At the first two stages supppiies of all kinds are relatively scantier, but at Tang-i-Zard (stage 3), and from there onwards, plentiful. ETruz ibad, with its numerous outlying villages and broad fertile plain, should be able to furnish supplies for a brigade. If previous notice were given, large quantities of supplies might be collected here, and also—though to a less extent—in the Khwaj ii and Kavar villages, adjacent to the on-' ward line of march to Shir iz. Wheat and barley are harvested from the beginning of May to the beginning of June, according to the elevation. Live-stock from Tang-i-Zard to Shiraz. Transport —Donkeys and camels in the proper cion of ten to one are employed on this route. Mules are rare. Of the camels employed, a portion be long to Meh'ar and Abadeh, their owners seeking to utilise them on this route when the Shiraz-Isfahah route becomes too heavy for them. A portion belong to Jahrum, and are employed to transport opium and other produce from that district, via Firuzabad to Bushire for shipment. A third portion belongs to the Qaraghanlu branch of the Qash^ai tribe settled at Flruzabad (r/. stage 6), and, in smaller numbers, in or close to Shiraz, and transports gums and carpets to Bushire, bringing back general merchandize. Camel caravans number from 40 to 50, according to one native infor mant, but according to another, from 100 to 1,000. Of the donkey caravans, some come from Maimand, trans porting rose-water, which is extensively fabricated in that district, to Shiraz and in larger quantities to Bushire for ship ment to India. Others are the property of the Qaraghanlu tribe above referred to. Donkey caravans appear to number from 50 to 100 or more. Alternative stages .—From native information it would appear that stage 3 can be broken at a point known as Malakun, about 12 miles E. of Abram. Fresh water. No supplies. (6) Stage 5. From the same source it would appear that native caravans are in the habit of breaking this stage between Bushkan and Farushband at a point called Du Shaikh, which, M51CG3 T58 Route No. I (C) — contd. however was not identified in the route (perhaps it might be at the Targe river about 14* miles E. of Bushkan) where there rs no village and no supplies are obtainable. + Pr.^ (c) Stage 6.

The ’Ali Changi road, a b road beaten track, runs almost due E. At about 7® miles a path is indicated by native information as running N.-W. to Chaghadak, and almost from the same point another is said to run E.-S.-E. to the southern extremity of Gurak. Up to 11 miles the plain dry mud with a salt efflorescence, is dotted only with a little sparse scrub. Eastward a belt of palm trees run ning N.-E. to S.-W., denotes the villages of ’All Changi and Gurak, Three or four miles beyond, and to the N.-E. of the latter village, rises a large and conspicuous mound of sand and rock, known locally as Qalatak.

General direction E.- S * - E. From the camp- 25-| m. ing-ground a path leads S.-E. in a few hundred yards to the main road, which runs N.-E. ascending slightly for rather more than a mile over sandy country, partially cultivated, chiefly with melons. The direc tion then changes to E. . At 1^ mile; a tract of sand dunes is entered, where the going is heavy over slight inequalities of ground. At 2A miles the track emerges into an open plain which is partially cultivated. The rocky ridge of Qalatak, N.-E. of Gurak, is sighted about 4 miles to the 8., and the village of Buneh Gaz about J a mile ahead. The road now trends E.-S.-E. and maintains this direction until within 3 miles of Ahr“m. About 2g miles are two wells of sweet water to the S. within a stone’s throw of the road ; and about 2f miles several wells of brackish water a hundred yards off the road to the ndrth. At 3 miles is Buneh Gaz, a village with several towers, standing im mediately on the N. side of the road, pleasantly situated among clumps of tamarisks, palm groves, and plots of vegetable culti vation. Fresh water is said to be abundant in the village. There are about 120 families; supplies, according to native in formation, are plentiful; there are also numerous flocks. It should be noted that from this point to Ahr m, there is no more i260 Route No. I (0)— contd. ftes|i water on the road, though report saj^s there is some ctt various villages off it. Shortly after leaving Buneh Gaz, ti e nature of the soil, hitherto sandy, changes to a hard greyish for mation, which affords excellent going although it would pro bably be heavy after rain. The road, as far as the Ahram river is almost a dead level. The plain is covered with capers and other flowering plants and shrubs. There were numerous flocks and a large herd of camels grazing, the latter said to belong to Saidabad, a village which Mr. Grahame was unable to locate. Dotted about the plain both to N. and 8. of the road are palm groves and numerous castellated hamlets and farmhouses. On the N. side of the road, at about 3^ miles, is the farmhouse of Haji ’All with towers and at about 4 miles a short distance to the N. of the road the castellated hamlet of Kaleh Meshed Husain. At about 3 miles the village of B'ghak standing about a stone's throw to the S. of the road, the main portion about 360 feet square, enclosed by a high mud wall with round towers at three of the corners. The village is said to contain some 300 inhabitants. Opposite the village on the N. side of the road is a small half-ruined imarnzadeh shaded by a group of tamarisk and palms fed by water, which is said to be brackish, in a deep cutting. Shortly after leaving Baghak palm groves, wells of orackish water line the S. side of the road for about 2 miles. At 6| miles about a furlong off the road to the S., is DehZar Muhammad Karim, a small village said to have good fresh water. The direction is now almost due B., and at 8 miles E.-N.-E. At about 8} miles the Ahram river appears within 200 or 300 yards N. of the road. Eor about a mile the road and the river-bed run almost parallel, and then diverge, the road continuing to run almost due E., while the river trends more N.-E. At about 10 miles the river reappears on the hL side of the road. Both banks are steep, and the bed is half- choked with rushes, through which only a trickle of water flows in a westerly direction. At 11 miles the river is crossed diagonally towards the N.-N.-E. The bed of the river here is about 187 feet wide, with only 2 or 3 inches of water in one place. A strong wheeled vehicle could without difficulty be driven across. The west bank is ramped, and the bed of the river at the ford is gravel.

The village con sists of about 140 families; camels 200; sheep and goafs 500 to 600; cows 200 ; donkeys 200. The village is hedged in on the E. and N. by palm gardens. About two-thirds of the houses in the village appear to be in ruins. The village possesses no milk All wheat is handground. Camping ground .—There is a good camping-ground on the far (south) side of the river-bed about 1,250 feet S.-S.-W. of the village among palm trees watered by brackish running water. Water .—Slightly brackish from a well 3 miles S.-E. of the village. In the dry season water at Ahram is practically un drinkable. It is also stated that water can be obtained from a well in the bed of the river, 500 feet from the S.-E. angle of the village. Supplies. 3 TANG-LZARD *. 20 m.

At 1 mile it begins to rise, running Nk-ISL-E. along a mid towards the mountains. At 2| miles it dips down into the river bed and turns due E. At 2f miles it crosses the river from N. to S. For the next 12 miles the path continues to cross and recross the meanderings of the stream, sometimes running alongside it and sometimes rising above it. At 4f miles after the tenth crossing, the track passes on rising ground the remains of an old mill with clumps of tamarisk on the S. side of the road, and near it some graves. At about 6f. miles, after crossing the stream for the thirteenth time, it enters a very rocky defile, with the remains of an old fortress, crowning a crag, on the S. side of the road. At about 7| miles, this defile opens out. The path ascends for about | a mile, and then descends into a steep nald with a trickle of water in it. This is followed for about a mile. The path then makes three ascents with descents intoRoute No. I (G)--contd. the river-bed, and frequent crossings and recrossings of this* The general direction is at times E., and at times E. by N. A ter crossing the river for the twentieth time at about ll^ miles, t e path turns sharp to the N., and passes for a furlong through a narrow cleft, 15 to 20 feet wide, in the rocks, kno wn locally as Qandillak. According to native information (at Tang i-Zard), there is a stream of fresh water, just beyond the upper (N. end) of this cleft at a point, called Malakun, which is made use of as a halting-place by caravans. The next 4 or 5 mixes of road are distressing, being in a great measure up the bed oi the torrent over boulders and rocks and at times through pools of wateiv The whole series of defiles appears to be designated.by the name, Tang-i-Bahrsh. At about 18 miles are the remains of an old mill apparently used as a halting-place by tribesmen; the water in the stream is brackish, but fit for animals. From this point the path tends E. by S., and after running for about 5 furlongs up the valley with a stream on the right (S.) and remains of a, watercourse on the left (N.), debouches into a cultivated amphitheatre about 4 miles long by 2 broad, on the N.-E. of which lie three villages, Kalimeh (N.), Tang-i-Zard (E.), and Farlab (S.-E.). After this is entered the stream bends N.-E. towards Kalimeh. The road skirts the western side of the amphitheatre, then (about 18 miles) strikes E. by N. across the plain to Tang-i- Zard, crossing the river by a small bridge, a few hundred yards before that village is reached (at about 20 miles). According to native information, 40 families of 100 inhabitants; donkeys 90 to 100; mules 3 or 4 ; cows arid oxen 60 ; sheep and goats 100. It has a fort with two towers.

Out in the plain to the S.-E. another similar ruin is sighted, and beyond it the village of Barmak {rids stage 5), said to be 2 farsakhs distant from the road. At about 21J miles, there are large clumps of ] cvn ~r on both sides of the road, and the remains of wells and watercourses. This stretch of land is known as Kun r-i-M lik.

About 21 miles it crosses a shallow will about 150 feet broad, and reaches a wide plateau known as the Dashtak- i-Siah, covered with a great variety of prickly flowering plants. There is a well of fresh water off the road to the right (Ik), the Chah Anbari-i-Dashtak. To the left there is a reservoir for tain water. At about 25 miles, the road again begins to rise, trend ing east to the Gardaneh-i Slab, a narrow gorge with the bed oka small stream running down it. A.t about 25 miles, there is a ruined reservoir on the right (S.) of the road, and the remains of a tower on a crag on the left. Just after passing these, there is a nlentiful supply of fresh water flowing in the watercourse on the right of the roacl, fed by a spring in the rocks to the left above the road. The water is known as the Ab-i-Slah. At about 20, miles, the top of the pass is reached, the last mile of the ascent being made by a very steep zigzag. The road then crosses a. small plateau whence there is an easy descent of about 2 miles-. At about 28| : miles, the broad fertile plain of Firuz-SMd is reached. It slopes from the N.-Ih to the S.-W. and is plentifully watered by streamlets having their sources to the N.-E. The gardens'of Eiruz'lbad are visible at the N.-E. end of the plain, about 8 miles- distant as the crow flies, but the road sweeping all round the plain to the N.-N. E. covers about 9-| miles. Between the first and second miles three small nilas cross the road from the N.-E. to the S.-W. Between the second and third miles, three streams, viz., the Ab-i-Khirneh (the name of the second is not known) and the Ab-i-Bagiun, the last, a considerable volume of water, flowing in the same direction, and watering the tall standing crops. At about 3f miles, the road trends a little more east, and at 8 miles, passes Deh Barm to the right (S.) of the road, a little village with some springs of fresh water. At about 8 mites, the road passes the hamlet of Kaleh Slab, to the right qf the road, and descends into a broad and partially cultivated with a stream flowing with considerable force, 150 feet broad, from the N.-N.-E. to the S. This is crossed just below a weir which diverts the major part of the water to IJruzabad. The water below the weir is up to a man’s knees. A few hundred yards k.368 Route No. l(c)—contd. further on the road traverses the flourishing little village of Deh Kushk, with gardens of pomegranates and other fruit trees over-topped by walnut and palm trees. On the further (E.) side of Deh Kushk is some rice cultivation. There are the ruins of an ancient town with a conspicuous shaft of masonry about a mile to the S. of the road. On the S. is the village of Deh-i-Dehishan, and on the N. that of Bagh-i-Shah, both embed ded in gardens. At about 9| miles from the entrance to the plain and about 38 miles from Earashband, the main portion of Eiruzabad is reached. It should be noted that the route usually followed by caravans does not go as far east as EiruzabM proper, but branches off across the plain to Deb-i-Nau, an out standing portion of Eiruzabad, lying 4- or 5 miles W. by S. of it. Firuzabad is apparently an exceptionally flourishing village, consisting of spme eleven different portions, dotted about the plain, enjoying a remarkably fine climate and an abundance of water. It is said to number about 600 houses, with a popu lation of 2,000. Cows and oxen about 1,000. For further in formation see the article in the Gazetteer of Persia. Route Nos.

The one now followed runs N. W., and passing the outlying portion of Firuzabad, known as Sar-i-Maidan, cuts, at about 5 miles, the caravan road near the river, close to the point at which on its opposite bank (W.j stands a conspicuous ruin, apparentlv o. a palace or bath, but known to the Persians as Atish Kadeh Azam, i.e., the largest fire temple. On the S. side of it is a large circular pool of water, fed by an underground spring furnishing inexhaustible supply of fresh water which overflows into a watercourse running eastward. From here the road ascendin* very gradually, soon enters the Tang-Ab pass, a narrow gorge with rocks rising precipitously on each side, and a river flowing69 Route No. 1(e)— contd. deep and strong down a stony bed. The road continues to ascend in the direction IST.-N.-E., from which the river flows, and for about 7 miles runs alongside or parallel to the river, which it crosses eleven times before separating from it at the far (JN.) end of the Halalu pass. Almost immediately after passing the ruin above mentioned the road crosses to the W. bank. At 8 miles, it recrosses to the right (E.), near the remains of an ancient bridge. At about 8^ miles, the road passes the extensive ruins of an old castle and fortifications crowning a crest on the right ( W.). At about 9|- miles it recrosses the river to the E. bank high above which further remains of fortifications appear. At about 9f miles, it recrosses to the W. bank which is then followed. The road and the river here turn almost due E., and the long line of the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, above men tioned, with its fortifications, is now sighted from the rear. At about 11-J miles the river is again recrossed to the E. bank and then again back to the W. bank. The gorge now begins to open out ana runs almost due N. At 12 miles, the road re crosses to the W. bank and ascends high above it. It then passes some graves, and descends to the river recrossing to the E. bank at about 12J- miles. Shortly after this point the road diverges from the river, and, deflecting slightly to the N.-E., crosses a widening plateau, passes Kaleh-i-Suzakfm to the W., and at about 13 miles enters the Tang i-Halalu, a short and easv path between two high bluffs. Here the river is rejoined, the road running for a short distance N.-E. along the S. bank, crossing to the opposite bank, and returning. At about miles is a bread amphitheatre cut up with morasses and watercourses. Striking across this, the road reaches at about 16^ miles the village of Kaleh Mianeh-i-Qamagun, whence it ascends slightly E. of N. The village of Ibrahimabad, at 18J miles, lies a little to the W. of the main road, and is reached by paths run ring through treacherous swamps of rice, which is here ee te isively cultivated. It is worth noting that there is not now any particu lar village designated as Ivbawjal that name being given to the plain or districts extending from the Halalu to the beginning of the Zanjlran pass, and comprises amongst others the villages of Ibrahimabad, Javakun, Sari dan, and Zanjlran. Ibrahimabad is a small village with the fort and about 60 families, 25 cows and oxen, 30 donkeys, 100 sheep and goats.70 Route No. I{c)—contd. Wafer. —Plentiful. Supplies. —Fair.

Thence it strikes across a plain covered with alternate patches of rice and clover, leaving the river to the W., and, at about 2 miles, rejoins the cara van road running due east. About miles, the ground begins to rise in very gradual shelves dignified by the name of a pass, the Gardaneh-i-Pidunl. At 3 miles, the village of Kaieh-i-B&gt;ji Muhram is sighted about 3 miles to the N. At 6 m iles, the village of Kaleh-i-Ab-Safid lies on the same side, but nearer to the road. A little stream fed by *a spring on the north side of the road is crossed. At 6|- miles the castellated village of Kaleh-i-Z* .njlrrn appears on a hillock about 300 yards to the N. of the road. The little stream is then recrossed. At 6f miles and 7 miles are two springs of fresh water fed from a watercourse on the N. of the track, which bubble across the road. At about 8 miles* the small stone-built caravansarai of Zanjlr, partially ruined* stands on the right of the road. About 300 yards N.-E. of this, at the entrance to the Tang-i-Zanjin'n the road bifurcates, one branch running S.-E., to Mainland, about 4 [arsakbs over the Seh Huran district(according to native information), the other as cending the glen by a rocky path made slippery by the over-flow of water from the streamlet, which gushes down with consider able force now on the right, now on the left, of the path through channels or races artificially dyked up in places. About 9f miles, the path widens out into a broad and easy ascent, the direction being N.-W. About 121 miles, the highest point of the Zanjlr an glen is reached, and at 13 miles, a few hundred yards road is the little village of Muk with clumps of widow trees, and a plantation of roses.

The ascent then begins to become steeper and soon develops int o a rough zigzag with a severe gradient. About 15 miles, and 2 miles beyond Muk, the top of the Muk pass is reached and a view over the Kavir plateau opens out. From this point there is a sheer descent by a broad road composed chiefly of loose shingle. At about 18 miles is a large mound on the south side of the road known as Gir-i-Bahman. Here the pass prac tically ends, but it is nearly 3 miles more before the road, turn ing due W. for f of a mile and then bending northwards, gets free of the outlying spurs and dropping sudden]} 7 into the deep bed of the Kara Agh ch river, crosses that stream by a fine stone bridge., about 12 feet broad and 275 feet long, of six arches.

At 14^ miles reach Gurak ; 50 houses of mats, or mud and stone. Stotherd reports as follows:—The road up to this point is easy-going for all arms. There is nothing to retard the rate of marching in dry weather. The peak of the Kuh-i- Khurmuj affords a good landmark. Gurak ridge, which the road is shown in the map as crossing, is important as offering a posi tion facing S -W. to a force advancing on Bushire from the E. or S.-E, It commands the low-lying sandy ground towards Bushire, and has a mean elevation of 300 feet above the plain. The right or northern flank is the weakest, and is open to a turning movement under cover of the date plantations. This same ridge should also afford a position facing N.-E. to a force covering Bushire against a force advancing from the E, Its extreme length would necessitate, however, a very strong body of troops to occupy it properly. It would afford some good artillery positions covering the plain towards the main mourn tain ranges.

Some i mile up stream all these channels had disappeared, the river bed being quite dry. No further trace of wa,ter was seen along the whole length of the Shahpur river but indications pointed to it being present under the bed at no great depth. (Naudan was not visited but local inhabitants stated the water was still plentiful and good.) _ At mile 8 turn S.-E. and proceed up the river bed to mile 9, where the main track goes due E. across the Kuhmarreh valley, ascending graduallv. This valley and the adjacent hillsides aie covered with trees, mostly oak, about .j 0 to 4:0 feet high, and almond trees. At mile 12 reach the village of Naudan , the last half mile being a climb of 300 feet. Naudan village contains about 200 hou es, some of which are large and well built. It is as filthy as the usual Persian village. The normal number of inhabitants was 700 but half of these died of influenza in the autumn of 1918. The Kuhmarreh valley and its villages are the property of the Nazim-ul-Mulk, brother-in-law of the Qawam. Rice, barley, millet and wheat are cultivated, the rice being famous in Ears for its quality. Except for small parties, Naudan has little to ' recommend it as a halting stage. Troops or large caravans, would do better to halt 2 miles S. near the Shahpur river.

Easy, open going but stony in places. At mile pass the village of Gurgidan. About 30 houses, some cultivation, and a good stream of water. At mile 7^ the village of Murdak can be seen 2 miles to the Nv. close under the hills. At mile 9 turn due east towards a cleft in the mountains. At mile 10 enter a narrow gorge in the hills, with precipitous cliffs on both sides. There are well-preserved traces of an ancient road. The track for | mile up a narrow gorge, full of rocks and boulders, and called the Tang-i-Bai Raiat, is an ancient paved causeway, labout 4 to 5 feet wide. It is neglected and out of repair but passable for laden mules. At mile 10| reach the deserted village of Bal Ha : at (3,000'). About 30 houses and some terraced fields. This village also belongs to the Nazim-ul-Mulk. The.bed of the torrent has pools of water after rain, but normally is dry. Leaving the north of the gorge an alternative track pro ceeds directly S.-E.. nor it is necessary to go first to Naudan. The village of Bal Ha at was found deserted and there were no signs of any water. There is a small stream of good water at the village of Plr Abdul Hasan about f m.

PIr Abdul Hasan is a small village of f0—30 houses, clustering around the shrine and the neighbouring village of Deh Kanak which is some | m. distant between Pir Abdul Hasan and the Bal Ha at gorge. Deh Kanak, on the left bank of the stream, would probably produce little, if any. There is no drinking water at Deh Kanak. The track proceeds S.-E. up the underfeatures of the main torrent bed, and there are many traces of an ancient, veil-graded road. The going, though steep, is not difficult for laden mules. At mile 14 the track descends to the river bed. There are some old terraced fields and the ruins of old stone houses. This place is called Ab-iHMrra. Camping ground. —Sufficient for a battalion and 500 animals. Water.* —-There is an old tank on the S. side of the river bed, rain fed, which in the winter contains water for 200 to 300 animals. After rain there are pools in the river bed. There is a cave in the hillside, fed by a spring, which is said always to contain water. It is hard to find without a guide. This spring is called the Ab-i-Kurra. The mouth of the cave is just sufficiently large to allow a man to enter. The water is some 15 feet down. Amount was estimated at about 45 gallons. This cave is about 100 yards up the hillside from track. There is a small needle rock due S.-W. from mouth of the cave. This neddle is a prominent object half-way up the face of the opposite hill. It would, however, be advisable to take a local guide to make sure of finding the stream. In July 1920 there was no water at Ab-i-Kurra Abundant. The ground is covered with trees.

There is iron ore along this upper track. .From the watershed at 4J miles, keeping S.-E., the track descends steeply down a slope of sheet rock composed of slate and shale. Horses and laden mules must be led down carefully. At mile 6 the bottom is reached (i) ? 09(E). The valley here is covered with trees and grass, and several valleys and water courses join in, which come down from the main mountain ridge on the N.-E. side. A watercourse, which comes down froin the point marked 63-B, in Degree Sheet No. 10'0 is called the Ab-i- ’ Hanna or Ab-i-Ahanna. On the 8th February 1919, it was raining heavily and the flood water varied from 2 to 4 feet deep, varying rapidly. Colonel Crton was delayed 4 hours, and some mules narrowly escaped drowning. At mile 6# another torrent of considerable size has to be forded (9' deep). * These torrents are quite dry in the summer. The track now ascends ( continually, mainly following spurs between watercourses which are occasionally sheet rock of slate and shale. The going is not very difficult for laden mules. The torrents have cut deep narrow beds in the hillside, regular canons, sometimes 220' or more deep. The hillsides are well wooded, chiefly oak trees. ; 1 At mile II the slope becomes easier. This part of the hill is covered with a layer, about 10 to 20 feet deep, of calcined lava- like rock. u At mile 12 the top of the Muha Nairn is reached (7,200'). The snow line in the winter just reaches down the main moun tains to the summit of the Mulla Naira KutaL About half a mile to the S.-E. from the foot of the main ascent of the Mulla Naira Pass, a spring, marked on the Degree Sheet, can be seen falling over the rocks. This spring contains excellent drinking water but the quantity is small. Another similar spring falls into a small valley about f m. to the N.~E. There is a small spring of water, viiich animals refuse to drink, from half-way down the N. -E. side of the pass. An easy track, through low shaly hills, leads down to the level Dasht-i-Arjan plain, and the main track along the line of telegraph posts is reached at mite 14 (6,60Q / ).

Another well is passed at 4| miles. The water is good ; a bucket and rope are required. The village of Band Amir is reached at 8J miles. There are 300 houses, 10 per cent, of which are of masonry. In habitants 1,570; goats 300 ; cows 150 ; donkeys 8 ; mules 6 ; there are 25 water mills which can grind 100 maunds per diem. Supplies of ohoosa, ata, gin, meat, etc., obtainable for a battalion of infantry with transport. There is a good Qamping-ground. There is a masonry bridge over the-Band AmTr river about 220 yards long, 15 feet wide, 13 arches, about 4 feet above water. Carts would find this river difficult to cross except at the bridge. After leaving the bridge the road crosses the plain to the village of the Gurbalak at 12f miles. Gurbalak consists of 5 houses. Rations can be obtained. Good camping-ground. The road then continues to Rashmigun at 16J miles. Water iB obtainable on the way from irrigation channels. .

Kinareh is reached at 19J miles, the road having run the whole way from Band Amir over an open plain. The road is suitable for all arms with the exception of wheeled artillery. From Pfizeh Zarghun to Band Amir the road lies under the hills to the S. From Band Amir to Kinareh it crosses the level plain of Marvdasht. The country is well populated and watered. There are camping-grounds near water. The line of the Band Amir river cutting the plain of Marvdasht offers a line of resistance against a force advancing from N. or S., especially the former, as the mountains S. of the bridge of Pul-i- Khan and Band Amir command the crossing at those places.

Before this point the road from Slvand followed by the post wagons branches off to the right rear. The caravan route crosses the Dasht-i-Bal ford and rejoins the post road at that point. From there onwards the road runs broad and good to Sivand taie Route No. I. The road from the chap 'rich inch to the puzih by Takht-i-Taus is stony and undulating over the spurs from the mountains; from there across the plains to the gardens of Said on it is level (except for the drop into the river-bed). Though good, it is soft, and liable to become much cut up and heavy in. bad weather or with much traffic. The road from the gardens onwards is generally good, except where the mountains come down to it, where it is narrow and bad. There is nothing to prevent the movement of all arms across the plain, to the right and left of the road, when it runs sufficiently far from the river between Takht-i-Taus and the gardens of Saidun.

The post waggons use this road and a road running parallel to it, between the village and the garden of the Qawam indifferently. This latter road joins the main road at the gardens of Qav/amabad at 2| miles. The road then runs under the mountains till it reaches the shoulder at the entrance to the Sangbur tangi just inside which the post-road branches off nearly due S. The road then runs across the Ealllak plain to the river Pulvar at 7 miles, which is forded by a fairly good track. 3 feet of water in April 1918. The N. approach to the ford is not bad, but the southern ascent is steep and difficult, and delay to wheeled transport must be expected. The ford in summer has a width of 12 yards and depth of about feet in winter it becomes, at times, impassable. The road from the ford goes to the village of Qasrdasht, about f mile distant, from where a second road runs to Qawfmab- d, crossing the river by a ford about half a mile below the other, and j oining the main post road between the Tang-i-Kamm and the gardens of Qawamabad. Qasrdasht consists of 100 houses inside walls. Goats 500, 80 cows. There would probably be barley and bhusa just after the harvest for one infantry regiment and two cavalry regiments, but these supplies would have to be laid in previously. Erom Qasrdasht the road runs E. across the plain, which, is dotted with villages to the two towns side by side of Kalilak atid Sa’adatabad. The road is a mere track across the plain, crossing two irrigation channels of some size by kacha bridges of mud and logs, and fording a third.

Road now skirts a ridge of low^ hills running up from the S. and crosses the river Gulad r. This is a tributary of the Pulv.“r and is only 10-12 yards broad, and on 28th April 1918 the depth of water at this ford was about 2 feet. The road now skirts low hills to the north and is difficult in places. At 5 miles the stream is again crossed by an easy shallow ford. A.fter the crossing the road ascends gradually and at 7 miles enters a narrow, stony and difficult tang, 1| miles in length. After leaving this tang the road continues to ascend and at 9 miles another, but easier tang is entered. The ascent is easy and the summit is reached at 10 miles.

Close to the junction there is a bad bit of road with a drop into a ndld and a bad crossing. But a graded road has been built round this bad bit for motors. Immediately after this water course is crossed the road drops into another dry watercourse. The plain which is crossed is commanded by the ridges at the top of the ascent leading to the Dehbid plateau. These ridges are formed by a double range which forms a natural position. They extend across the road in two lines one and a half miles distant from each other ; on the E. they make a wide sweep round to the flank, but could be turned by the low-lying ground to the west. Dehbid is the name of a group of seven villages of which Daulata- bad, where the telegraph station, caravansarai, and a chapnr- Ichaneh are situated, is usually known as Dehbid.

Continuing it passes MassinI on the right. From here it again requires spade work in many places, such as at the irrigation channels, to make it good for traffic. Another walled village is then passed. Afterwards the road becomes very narrow and has at first a wall on the right, being afterwards sunk between the surrounding cultivation. After crossing a stony piece of open ground it fords an irrigation channel which works a mill passed on the right. The road is here fair, with no culti vation on the left. The walls of the garden of Salar next confine the road, and the village of that name is reached, surrounded by gardens. From here the road runs to Maran, being in places very bad, through enclosed country, where spade work would again be necessary or guns would have to be man-handled. The walls of the cultivation of Qawamabad are to be seen from here across the nala which runs between this and the post-road. The next section of the road is much broken by the banked irrigation channels which cross it: traffic would be difficult, if not impos sible unless they were cleared away. The village of Zlarat is reached through country which is still much enclosed, Dalandun having first been passed. On leaving the former a broad ndld is crossed, in which is cultivation. The road then runs, sunk between the cultivation on either side, and here improves. The gardens and village of Vasbab are then reached and the road runs from there, first between walls, and then over cultivation, to the junction with the post-road, a little over three-quarters of a mile from Qumisheh. Alternative Route I (U). From the KUTAL-I-UROHlN to ISFAHAN via QALU SHUR. Capper, 1912.

At the 20th mile the track commences a slight ascent over a shaley surface and at the 22nd mile commences to cross the deep un dulating ridge that covers the approach to Isfahan. Here a branch track, suitable for pack transport, branches off to the bridge of 5 All Verdi. Track now leads N. and runs through the bridge, the summit of which is reached at the 24th mile. The descent now commences and at the 26th mile track debouches upon the glacis-like shaley plain that runs down to the Zindeb-Rud. The ridge, which is a very important tactical feature, can be crossed by all arms, including wheeled artilleryj everywhere but wheeled transport should be confined to the track. At the 27th mile the track enters the graveyard and continues through it to the bridge of Khaju &gt; 27| miles. A broad boulevard lead^ from the bridge. NOTES ON ROUTES IN THE VALLEY N. W. OF SHIRAZ. There are four routes leading up this valley. No. 1 runs from the most northern corner of the city near the RarguzaVs house in an N.-E. direction, crossing the river near the Bagh-i- Samad Agha and leading up to a kutal N. of Bulvardi. Here the road is narrow and stony and continues so, running between vineyard walls to Kushk-i-Pusht-i-Maula. This is a small village distant 5 miles from Shiraz ; it contains one mill capable of crushing 5 kharvars of wheat per day. The inhabitants are cultivators and there are no supplies. There is a Plentiful supply of water. This road leads on to Mansurabad, Abbasabad and Kushk-i-Bicheh but these portions were not reconnoitred. It is unfit, for carts. ^1 o.

This is a main route and is fit for carts but the village of Masjid-i-Bardeh should be avoided as carts cannot pass through it. After l^rd miles the old Gendarmeriepost atSangari is reached. Here the road to Chinar Rahdar crosses. At this place there is a mill ; 1,000 yards beyond this a lane, which starts between Nasriyeh and the shrine of Sheikh Abdul Waffa, joins in ; 400 yards further on is Du Rah from which point a lane leads to the river bed a little below Chaugi and another 100 yards further leads S.-W. to the village of Tak Khadis. From this point the road runs between garden walls for nearly four miles. At intervals lanes lead off to the river. One mile from Du Rah a lane leads off to the village of Deh Khareh; 500 yards beyond this lane is a mill turning out 4 Jcharvdrs p er day. Half a mile further on the Ragh-i-Nawab is reached ; from here a road branches N. (i.e., half right) to Kushk- i-Pusht-i-Maula. Beyond (W.) of the Bagh the road again forks, the left hand leading into the village of Masjid-i-Bardeh which carts should avoid as the streets are very narrow and only allow of horsemen in single file. The right hand road winds a bit and after 1,000 yards turns to the left and joins the road from Masjid-i-Bardeh near a mill and an old Gendermerie post. Here the road again forks. The main road passes to the N. of the mill and post, the other to the S. This latter, after 1 mile, emerges on a stony plain which it crosses to a ruined fort under the slopes of Kuh Darak (or Barfi). From here it runs up into the hills between Kuh Barfi and Kilh-i-Surkh. Masjid FBardeh is a good sized village enclosed on all sides by gardens and orchards. The village is entered through gates. Theie is a bazaar of about 20 shops and the produce of the sur rounding district is brought here for sale. A small amount of supplies could be obtained here. The main road, after passing the mill and post N. of the Masjid-i-Bardeh, continues between orchard walls for one and a quarter miles and then merges on a stony plain. Half a mile beyond this point a deep nald is crossed by a broken bridge (brick): The road then leads on to 3 trees in the middle of the plain from which point the ruined fort can be seen to the S.-W.; Mansurabad under the hills to the E. and Abbasabad nearly .hidden bv trees to the N.-E,102 Route No. I— concld. small village situated in the ang e of the river stream here.

At a little over l mile the village of Shlh- rinabad is passed on the right of the'Toad, some quarter of a mile awav, and then, within the next mile, Gardan-i-Turah on the left, and Binjan and Shadar l Ismail on the right. Water from irrigation channels continues plentiful for two miles beyond that point. The top of the kutdl of the Gardan-i-Gushti is reach ed at about 3} miles. The range of lo w hills stretches on either side of the road, and, with the Qull Kush blocking the direct road to Isfahan forms a position covering the advance from Shiraz on Isfahan via Dehbld. All arms could move across the plain which the road crosses, and the somewhat numerous irri gation channels near the groups of villages forming Dehbld, being mostly shallow, would form little or no obstacle. From the gardan the road quickly drops down to the GushtI ravine by an easy stony gradient. Here there is a stream of good water, which flows for some 1,000 yards and then dries up.' The n Hi being flat and broad, a camping ground is available here.

The walled village of Narlbrd stands amidst cultivation and walled gardens. There are 320 houses ; 1,290 inhabitants ; 1,200 goats ; 240 cows. Water is good and plentiful from the ledrez. From Xfir'b d the road runs over the plain, on which stand several villages. It passes through some walled cultivation and over five kdrezes. At 221- miles the road enters between some isolated limestone hills on the left and a red crag on the right of the road. On the hills to the left is a domed tower, known as the shrine of Darab Shik. When clear of the hills the road runs across a bare plain to Shiraz and continues through the village and its cultivation for half a mile, and reaches the village of Shamsabad at 27f miles. Except through Narabad and its walled cultivation, and at Shiraz, troops could move across the plain on either side of the road; there is nothing to interfere with the usual rates of marching. Shamsabad is an unwalled village consisting of 100 houses ; 450 inhabitants; 100 goats. Water. —Good. Supplies .—For one cavalry regiment. 8 DEH-I-SHIR .. 32J m. General direction N.* E. The road is over 182|- m. a level plain which imperceptibly descends, till the ruined fort of Khaneh Surkh is reached, and then imperceptibly rises, until the cultivation of Deh-i-Sbir is reached, when the rise is more accentuated. Leaving Shamsabad the road passes through cultivation and reaches the ruined and deserted village of Faizabad, at 2 miles. Here a Jcdrez crosses the road, and this is the last place where water is obtainable before crossing the desert from Faizabad over a barren plain for four miles to a ruined fort, where water is said to be procurable sometimes. Thence the road runs for 18|- miles over the plain, which is salt in places, and sandy in others, but generally gravelly. Here is an old fort where there is an ab-ambar but no supplies ; this place is reported to be a haunt of robbers. The ab-amhdr is about 8 feet by 24 and had four to five feet of water in it at the time of the report. The water is only fairly clear and, judging by the state of the M51CGS106 Route No. II — contd. i ground in the fort, very polluted. Four and i-,,r rvn ah-cMnbciv is reached ; tins is a half miles farther on ^te¥^&gt;^hed; this is about ten feet square, and has very foul-smelling water At 31 miles the road drops into a ndla with cultivation on both sides; there is water in an irrigation channel at the side of the road, and also a line of kixrezes. The road here is bad, but could be easily impror e as far as Deh-i-Shlr, which is reached at 322 miles. The village of Deh-i-Shir is unwalled, with a mud fort, and consists of 100 bouses : and a small caravansarai in bad repair. W a/ef .“Good.

A channel of good water lies the whole way on the right of the i oad. It issues from an artificial covered channel at the foit, and runs swiftly with a breadth of one and a half feet and a depth of one foot four inches, measured inside the artificial channel. The road is good, with a gravel surface, suitable for the movement of all arms which could also move across country and parallel to the road. At 6J miles, the hamlet of Shah Nishin with cultivation and gardens is reached on the right of the road. It is a small walled village consisting of 6 houses ; 40 inhabi tants. Water is obtained from an irrigation channel. Half a mile beyond the village the road enters a semi-circle of hills and commences to ascend. The ascent is easy at first, but gradually becomes more stony for one and a half miles, when there is a somewhat steep ascent over slippery rock, which would require a certain amount of labour to render it fit for the passage of horsed guns. The gardan of Shah Nishin is reached at 8f miles, and the road, after 200 j^ards of level, crosses a small irrigation channel, the water of which, although brackish, is said to be fit to drink. The hills on either side are open and practic able. The road then winds round hills to the gardens and village of Dehrishk. The road descends and is in two places very bad, Dehrishk is an unwalled village with walled gardens situated in a valley bounded by high hills which would be very difficulta half nil: about tenif 1 miles then.

The village consists of 34 nmd houses ; 150 inhabi tants ; 1,000 goats ; and 20 donkeys. Rations would be available for one squadron. A quarter of a mile after leaving the valley, the road turns more north, when the ascent of the Gardan-i- ’Allabad commences. The road runs up a dry water course, to which all arms with the exception of infantry and mountain guns would be confined. The top of the gar dan is reached at just over 5 miles. The ascent is very bad, and* though carriages are taken over it, it is practically impassable for wheeled artillery or trans- . port. Much might be done to improve it by removing loose stones,, but, in one place in the last two hundred yards of the ascent, blasting would have to be resorted to. Artillery might be handled over. The rugged hills on either side of the gardan could be climbed with great difficulty. Parallel with the pass- itself, that on the right is unclimbable and would have to be climbed further back. A single sniper on this hill could make the passage a matter of the loss of some life, but the range would have to be long. The descent is very bad, running down a. ravine, and further on over slopes which become less steep as- the road progresses. At 16§ miles there is a small pond on the right of the road, the water which feeds it coming from a covered channel. The road from here crosses a spur and then runs down the valley with irregular hills on either side. The small village of Reh Xau is entered at 19 miles, and the road, running along the right bank of a stream, reaches ’All ‘b d at 20 miles. The village is unwalled, and consists of ISP mud houses 600 inhabitants ; 1,000 goats. Water .—Good and plentifuL Supplies .—For one cavalry regiment. 10 TAFT . • .. 24J m. General direction F. The road runs down the 227m. broad valley dotted with villages, cultivation and houses, and crosses the great easy slopes from the mountains on the right to a hamlet where a stream, issuing from a covered channel, forms a pond, at which animals can be watered. It then continues down the valley past a hill on the left, which commands it. Faizabad is passed, standing in the mouth of valley which runs into the one in which the road lies, and divided from it by low rugged hills. The #2108 Koute No. II — contd. road to Sanichi comes up this valley, and then, keeping under the hills to the N.-E., joins the Yazd road at about 14} miles. A little further on an db-ambctr is passed on the right of the road. Some half a mile beyond this the road bifurcates, the right branch dropping into a deep water-course which runs from the valley on the right, the left hand branch keeping to the left of the water for over one and three-quarters miles, and then crossing it and rejoining the right-hand one. There is little to choose between the two roads, the descent in both cases being bad, though practicable for artillery and wheeled traffic. From ' the junction, the road runs on the N.-E. side of the valley under the hills to Farasheh at 18} miles. The latter is a mean little village with plentiful water and cultivation. It consists of 150 mud houses; 640 inhabitants; and 100 goats. There are two mills which can grind 180 maunds of flour in the 24 hours. Rations would be procurable for an infantry regiment with trans port. Water good, perennial, and abundant from a Tcarez. Con tinuing from Farasheh, the road runs at first through gardens, and then crosses a dry nil a bed, with great crags on the right to the Mazra 9 Swab, which is watered by an irrigation channel on the left of the road, containing an abundant supply of good perennial water. From here the road enters a narrow defile, at the far end of which commences the cultivation of Taft, a long straggling village on either side of a dry river bed ; the road is passable for wheeled vehicles throughout. It runs down the valley, some five miles broad at ’Aliibhd, which gradually narrows until the defile is reached, passing through which the mountains recede again. Taft is a large village with a winter population of 800 and a summer population of from 4,000 to. 5,000. There are 5,000 goats ; 300 cows ; and 300 donkeys. There are 9 mills and 4 caravanserais.

At 4 miles Mubarakeh is passed lying across the stony plain to the right, ana, at a little over 54 miles Cham, on the left. The low mountains on the rmht which have been running towards the road, come vown to it at 64 miles, Zain'dnd being on the left with the low range behind it. The Yazd plain is here entered, the mountains on the right receding. There is a plentiful supply of water from a ■Kia'U which forms a stream at this point. The road soon after this divides, one branch going to the N. of the city, via the Bagh-i-Nadir, and the other to the southern quarter. the first continues good, until it enters the narrow street _ opt he suburbs of the city ; the second is only fair, until the cultivation of Yazd is reached. The road from Taft to Yazd is passable for all arms. Prom HANASHK (Stage 6) to DEH-I-SHlR (Stage 8). 40 rules. ^ stages. Authoritics. —-Jones, 1856 ; MacGregor, 1875.

Road. —Practicable for field artillery and carriages through out ; although sand is met with in various places, it presents no serious obstacle. It runs for the whole distance down one of the great parallel valleys, which run from N.-W. to S.-E. through the whole of S.-W. and S. Persia. The country traversed is almost level, with a fairly salubrious and uniform climate throughout. Climate. —The summers are moderate and the heat is not excessive. In winter the cold is fairly great, but snow only falls two or three times in January. In the winter severe winds are experienced on the more exposed parts of the route. Supplies. —There is a certain amount of supplies to be Obtained all along the route. Wheat and barley are grown at all the villages. The inhabitants possess fairly large and numerous flocks of sheep and goats. Grazing. —Generally obtainable for camels. Water. —At all stages, but rather brackish in places.

Then a good and firm road with a strip of kavlr on either side to 4 miles, where the S.-E. slope of the Gird-i-Kuh is reached. From here the main mountain range is some 15 miles distant, with an intervening strip of kavlr coated with a thick salt efflorescence. Pass down the E. side of the Gird-i-Kuh at a distance of some 2 miles. At 7 mil es cross a line of qanats from the base of the Gird-i-Kuh to the valley, dry at present, but it is expected that a village will in time spring up in the valley, and water lead down to it. Then over a splen did road to 13^ miles, where a line of sweet water is crossed. Swing round the end of Gird-i-Kuh to the village, 40 houses, 200 people ; small supplies ; fair water from 7 springs, all sweet; transport 12 camels and 20 donkeys.

Stages 6 and 7 are across a level plain and kavlr ,stage 8 a gentle rise and stage 9 descends to another level plain stage 10. From there stage 11 rises and in stage 12 there is a steep descent to the Nmz plain— a new graded road has been made down the Niriz (or Hasanabad) Kutal suitable for motor and wheeled transport. This is about a mile longer than the steep direct road which caravans still prefer to take. In stages 13 to 17 the road is undulating along the foot of the hills to the south of Lake Niriz—in stage 16 a steep road for wheeled transport has been made over the ridge at Pa-i- Talk. Stage 18 and part of 19 ascend to the watershed, which divides the valleys in which the Shiraz and Niriz Lakes are, and then descends to Shiraz. Wafer.—[s, good, plentiful at. all stages except at Chahil- abad where only a limited supply of good water can be got from two wells, and at Khaneh-i-Khet where the water is saline but plentiful from a Fuel.—Fuel is scarce, except near Khaneh-i-Khet, but scrub is available in limited quantities. Fodder .—Near the road there is only grazing for camels and donkeys. Horses and mules would have to be fed on bhoosa which can only be procured at Saidabad, Niriz and Shiraz and in limited quantities at the larger villages. Supplies .—Supplies for the reinforcement col umn (1917) had to be sent out from Saidabad, Niriz and Shiraz for the inter mediate stages between Saidabad and Shiriz. A small party might be able to procure supplies locally except at stages 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, and for these all supplies and fodder for horses and mules must be laid out or carried. Convoys.—A fortnightly convoy was started by the S. P. R. and caravans were escorted to and from Shlraz-Saida'bad. Motor road .—The newly prepared motor road varies in the following stages from the ordinary caravan route. In stages 6, 7, 8 and 9 the same route as the caravans, but after rains the kivir, in stage 7, would be impossible for wheeled transport* , 10 , an ? 11 motor road runs at the foot of the mils at a higher level to the east of the caravan road which crosses‘Wsisatu ^rayans i ! the foot; steep td ge at Pi shed, vh ^ Lakes ai t at Ckli be goth is saline k i, huts® 1 camels in 1 on Hi Shiraz 31 ; (1917) ll &gt;r theintf small D3ft i [&gt; stages f, r horses si the S.

The motor road does not go to Katru but turns off about 2£ miles from it and proceeds direct to HusainabSd. The caravans have to retrace their steps from Katru to rejoin the route. In stage 12, a new graded road for motor transport has been made down the Nlriz Kutal which is about a mile longer than the steep track usually followed by caravans. They join at the foot of the pass, and from there the caravan route makes straight across the plain to Nlriz, but the new motor road skirts round the foot of the hills on a higher level to avoid soft ground after rains. The tw r o roads again join about a mile from Nirrz. In stages 14 and 15 the road has been constructed for motors round by Allahabad to avoid the cultivation at Khir. From stage 1/ the motor road goes direct to Shir z avoiding Badeh.

The road continues through low hills for the first 3 miles and then crosses a small watercourse which supplies Bagh-i-Vishaneh (or Wazireh) at miles. From there the road runs across a broad open plain to Katru (19 miles), at first over firm sandy soil, then between miles 11 and 14 over kavir. In order bo avoid the kavir the new motor road has been constructed to the W. of the above caravan road at a higher level, nearer the foot of the hills which encircle the upper end of the plain. This road does not go to Katru but at 16 miles turns W. again and passes round the southern end of the range of hills between small low hills and proceeds to Hasanabad. From Bagh-i-Vishaneh a direct road to Hasanabad goes off to the W. over the hills. This avoids the long detour to the 8- md Katru. It is a long hard stage of about 28 miles and very bad going over a rough surface. Three ridges have to be crossed and there is no water en route. It is only passable for pack animals. Katru is an unwalled small town of about 200 houses artd a fort. To the S. and S.-W. there are gardens with cypress and fruit trees.

After crossing the kutal there is a steep descent and the direct tract goes down this, r dropping 600' in a mile. It is passable for pack animals and caravans still prefer this route. From the k 'tal a new graded road has been made suitable for motor transport. It is about a mile longer than the direct track which joins it again at the foot of the steep descent. At 5 miles the descent is gradual to Niriz—the track con* tinues straight across the plain but the motor road takes a sweep round on the higher ground at the foot of the hills to avoid the mud in wet weather. The track passes a small circular pond at about 9 miles and at 10 miles is joined by the motor road, reaching Niriz at 11J miles.

They do not rejoin until about 3 miles from the caravan- sarai. the motor road is in good condition and winds among the hills and along a river bed. The gradient is everywhere, easy with the exception of one descent. Some streams are cross ed, with very steep Irish bridges. The caravan track ascends the water course, the ascent is easy and the road is good. At 11 miles a stream with irrigation channels and some cultivation is reached. The mud hovel of Bid Khwab is reached at 16 miles. The stream is still ascended, being closely shut in by steep hills. In the bed are a good many trees. Then more, open country among the mountains is reached. The hills are gently sloping and there is a good deal of cultivation, but no permanent inha bitants.

It ascends gradually and rejoins the caravan track at about 4 miles after the latter has commenced to descend. The road is good and in fine weather there are no difficulties except some steep Irish bridges. During the winter it is sometimes impassable on account of deep snow ; it is then better to keep to the more open caravan track than to attempt the detour on which snow drifts. On the caravan track at 1 mile the Gudar-i-Surkh is reached, the ascent being fairly steep. The peak of Kuh-i-Surkh is about 1 mil© aw T ay to the W.

The road gradually ascends over the plain and at 1 mile a small village is passed on the left of the road. At 2£ miles the Ab-i-Lalehzar a good stream of water, is crossed. At 4 miles the road enters’ low hills, and ascends easily out of the broad Bardsir vallev to 6f miles where a little pass leads into a small plain; this is about 2 miles wide and is crossed in a N.-E. direction. The plain is bare. At 8| miles the plain is quitted by another small pass, and then the road lies amongst low rocky hills • still rising easily, to the first crest of the Gudar-i-Dukhtar from which there is a nasty stony descent. The bottom, which is 300 feet below the crest, is succeeded by a somewhat steep climb to the second pass of the same altitute as the first. This is gained at 9J miles, and the track runs down a rocky and narrow defile to the caravansarai of Khan-i-Kuh, which is reached at 1U miles. Just beyond this point, near the caravznsarai of Khan-i-Kuh, the track branches off to the left front, and runs down the bed of a shallow ravine, about 50 yards across At about 15 miles the track emerges from the foot hills and' then runs across a clay soil with a thin crust of gravel and devoid of vegetation.

Motor road and cara van track are the same. Sand for five miles, commencing about 1 mile from Baghin makes very heavy going for cars, which should keep to track ; the latter is very rough, and slow pace is essential. Ground just W. of the village of Sa’adatabad is a swamp after rain and cars have to make a detour to the right (S.), to avoid it. The caravan track leaves Baghin and crosses a line of jubes. The road lies over undulating ground, mostly gravel and sand. For the first two miles or so the route lies through cultivated ground. Cultivation, however, continues down the centre of the valley whilst the road turns N.-E., and rounding an outlying spur, passes close to the base of the hills on the left. At this point the village of Akbarabad lies some two. miles to the right of the road. There is some very heavy sand followed by clay until it nears the little village of Sa’adatabad at about 10 miles. The clay belt becomes a regular swamp after rain or the ' melting of the snow. At about 12 miles the road ma Akbarabad comes in on the right. From here the cultivation is continuous until the town is reached, which is entered at the Darvazeh-i- Bagh close to the Arq (house of the Governor-General, Govern ment offices, barracks, etc.). Shortly after entering the town the houses and gardens of the most prominent Kermanis are passed on the right. To get to the Consulate, the road passes through the Arq, across the Maidan-i-Arq, and through the main bazaar (about 1 mile long). It leaves the town by the Darvazeh-i- Masjid and from there there is H miles of metalled road to Bagh-i-Zeriskht which contains the Consulate and the housn of a few prominent Persians.ROUTE NO. 1.

ITater.—From Hormuz to Lar, water is obtained from Cisterns liable to dry up in the hot weather, but these should suffice for one regiment and transport for a day or two at anv time of year. In March 1007, when this report was writte/ the spring rains had failed and muleteers along the route reported that the quantity of water then found was the minimum expe rienced during the year. At Lar water in unlimited quantities is available for all purposes from a large aqueduct and from many wells. At Biriz from cisterns. Thence forward in un- hrnited quantities from wells, irrigation cuts and springs. ' At Lhah JLalkh, however, water is apt to be scanty. . Fuel. Fuel sufficient for two regiments of Indian infantry for a day could be obtained almost everywhere bv foraee parties,' at a short distance from the road, but British troops who require more wood and of a heavier kind, could not be sunnlied Fodder. Grazing for camels and donkeys is sufficient all the year round along the route; grazing is at its beS ffi the spring (when the route was traversed) and cannot be relied on as good all the year round. Mules are little used on the route, but from Banan to Shiraz, good grazing could usually be obtained for them m the spring. Elsewhere, and at othek season, they would have to be fed on bhoosF Grass for bosses would be excessively difficult to obtain at many of the stages; it i s un obtainable from the villages; khasil (green barley) could beRoute No. 1—contd. extensively used as a substitute from Hormuz onwards, during the spring. Supplies .—Bandar ’Abbas, being a seaport in close touch with Karachi, it would, for military fpurposes, be easiest and cheaper to provide grain and possibly fodder from Karachi. Flour and food stuffs are already largely imported from Bombay, and local purchase would not be economical. Nomads from Birkeh Nuh onwrads are always present during winter and sprint and own large flocks, which would probably suffice for three regiments of Indian infantry moving from day to day. The flocks consist mainly of goats with a few sheep and a very few cows. From Bandar ’ Abbas to La r, local supplies except of cattle are negligible, though the resources of towns should suffice to establish victualling depots along the route ; supplies thus pro- Tided, one regiment of Indian Infantry could move to Lar with* out much difficulty. The resources of Lar would probable suffice to victual a brigade with transport for an indefinite pz, riod, and also to augment the resources of Dahkuh and Birly which are scanty, hrom Binz onwards the road traverses a succession of fertile irrigated plains, and by requisitioning sup plies at each stage, from the neighbouring villages, two regi ments of Indian infantry could be victualled without much difficulty. Certain stages, e.g., Chah Talkh and Mukhak, have no supplies, vide Route report. No transport animals could be collected between Bandar ‘ Abbas and Lar; large numbers of camels and mules could be collected at Bandar ’Abbas, but this would deplete the numbers available for the Kerman route. There are about 400 donkeys at work between Bandar ’Abbas and Lar in the winter and spring ; at other times very few. About 1,500 donkeys and 200 camles could be collected at Lar, this being half the number believed to be regularly working between Lar and Lhmeh, and various towns in the interior. About 1,000 mules and 1,000 donkeys could be collected at Jahrum, thus deplet- mg Fasa, Darab, and Firuzabad, ^ , Alternative routes.-^) via the Tang-i-Zagh, Furg, Fasa | and Sarvistan ; this is 40 miles longer, and, as far as y ore difficult and never used. ■ &lt; {i) Wa f Jahrum ^ ^^abad (two roads).

Leaving the 150! m. town at its N. end, the road skirts the W. slopes of the Kadamgah hill. The road now follows a watercourse running S.-W. along the S. slopes of the Kadamgah hill, the slopes on either side of the valley being steep but-passable 400 feet above the plain level, and of limestone, which is quarried in places for building stone. At f mile, pass three cisterns containing water. At 1 mile road leaves the watercourse, and, keeping to the S. slopes of the hills, enters a narrow valley running N. and S. At IJ miles a well is passed and a line of qandts approaches the road. At 1^ miles a small cultivated plain is, entered, drained by the water* course just left. Lines of qandts running N. and S. are crossed. To the S. and W. low hills separate the valley from the Lar plain. The road leaves the plain at 2 miles, and runs up a stony and broken slope to the ca ^avansirai of Pusht-i-Sangar. Water from two cisterns ; grazing poor ; fuel nil ; supplies nil. Sangars on the plateau to the N.-E. denote the origin of the name of the sttrai, which stands on a stony plateau f of a mile broad and 5 miles long running E. and W., bounded on either side by low ridges, and drained by a deep ravine running W. from the slopes of the Kutt- i-Kurdeh. The road runs E.-N.-E. over the plateau, leaving it at 3 miles, and descends into the above ravine, here some 20 yards broad, with steep banks 100 feet high. At 4J miles the ravine is left, and the road runs N.-E., up the hills to the N. to the caravansarai and date groves of Kurmunu, reached at 4f miles. Water from three cisterns ; grazing poor ; fuel scanty ; z2172 Route Xo. 1— supplies nil. A footpath runs N.-TC. from the stirai over a ridge rejoining the road at miles. The road now runs tip a narrow ravine in places only 10 yards broad, sloping steeply to the E. bounded by hills 300 feet high on either side, to the Gardan-i- Narangi close to the summit of which is a small cistern (con* taining water in March 1907). The road now decends steeply to the Kurdeh plain, and is here often not over 6 feet wide, and although difficult for camels is regularly used by them. At 0| miles the large caravansarai of Kurdeh is passed. Grazing poor; water from the two cisterns ; fuel scanty ; supplies limited, from the village of Kurdeh situated 2 miles B.-S.-W. of the caravansarai. Kurdeh stands on a level, open, passable plain, cultivated all over, some 8 miles long and 4 miles broad, run ning E. and W., and draining in the latter direction. The road now runs N.-N.-E. over the stoneless plain to the cistern of Pazeh Khurf, passed at 9f miles, which contained water in March 1907 ; the road then circumvents the E. edge of the low ridge bounding the plain to the N., and runs N.-N.-W. along a water course flowing into the Kurdeh plain in a valley 1 mile wide, cultivated, open and passable. At 11 miles the road debouches along the watercourse into the Deh Kuh plain, which runs E. and W., about 2 miles broad and 4 miles long, draining into Kurdeh plain, and bounded on all sides by low hills.

The road now turns N.-E., up a valley f of a mile broad covered with grasses and scrubs and bounded on all sides by hills. At 2f miles the road enters the bad part of the tang, which is here a narrow watercourse running between lofty impassable hills, the bed being a mass of large stones and not over 6 yards broad, narrow ing down in one place to 5 feet. The road is here passable with difficulty by mules and donkeys, but impassable for cavalry and camels. At 4 miles the road emerges from a ravine and runs up a steep watercourse between high banks of conglomerate. At 4J miles the road emerges from the ravine and debouches on to a level plain stretching south known as Yazd-i-Khast. This plain narrows rapidly to the N. and becomes the Chah Tiz valley, drained by a broad and deep ravine with impassable banks, to the E. of which the road runs. This valley is bounded on either side by steep hills, some 1,500 feet high. The road stony, but not difficult, slopes gently upwards, crossing frequent watercourses running west to the main ravine. At 5 miles a cistern (containing water in March 1907) is passed. At Si miles, the mainstream is crossed and the road from this point keeps to the western slopes. At 9| miles the ruined huts of Ruzak are passed, a summer resort only. Water from one cistern ; grazing very good ; fuel plentiful ; supplies nil. At 10 miles the valley divides, one branch running N.-N.-W., the other N. ; the road follows the former, and constantly crosses it. At 10 miles a gap in the precipitous hills is passed, through which a footpath runs to Juwun via Kaleh Alburd, a ruined fort in the hills, said to have been occupied by Rustum.

At i mile the hills to the W. are pierced by a gap, 200 feet above the plain level. At 1 mile the Tang-i~Habak is passed 800 yards to the W. piercing the hills at plain level. A footpath is reported to run through this gap, w’i Bagh-i-Anjlr to Juwun. A large stream passes through the defile draining N.-E. into the main stream of the valley, which flows W.-N.-W. The road follows the latter, crossing the stream frequently, and is here stony and difficult in places, but as a rule, easy for pack animals, and sloping gently W.-N.-W. At 3 miles the road runs along the eastern slopes of a small ridge intervening between the main stream and the hills to the W. J of a mile distant. At 8 miles the road, still f of a mile from the hills to the W., leaves the stream, which runs W.-N.-W., and traverses low foot-hills. Two miles to the E. is the date grove and the small cultivated area of Salvu. At SJ miles the hills to the W. are pierced by a stream flowing N.-W., into the main stream, which it joins at 13 miles. At 9 miles, the shrine of Khurramabad is reached. Water from a spring ; grazing poor ; fuel plentiful; supplies nil A consider able area of irrigated cultivation surrounds the spot, which is . y n. summer.

At If miles are extensive walled gardens to the N.-W. At 2 miles is a small stream flowing N.-W. At 2f miles a third low ridge is traversed running E. and V/. across the plain, and the road passes the large walled gardens of Haidarabad, another road to Firuzabad diverging at this point up a cultivated valley, 4 miles broad at its mouth and gradually narrowing. At 5 miles the cultivation ceases, and grass and scrub prevail on either side of the road. At 5f miles is a low ridge running N.-W. across the plain. At 6 miles a river is crossed, running up the Firuzabad valley and impas’S- able after heavy rain; the bed is 60 yards broad and gravelly ; in M&amp;rch 1907 after two days’ rain there was ,3 feet of water ; the water is salt, except when in flood. At 6 miles the; road crosses a deep river bed by a stone bridge of five arches, 6 feet wide ; the bed of this river was almost dry, at the time when the other had 3 feet of water in it, and is probably an old channel of the same river. At this point the ro d to Fasa, Route No. 1(&amp;), diverges. The road now runs over a barren flat plain draining; W. to the main stream.

At 6 miles the village of Khafr is passed, h a mile to the E. of the road in a small valley. Babanajm and Khafr are plentifully water ed by a spring in the hills above. At 7 miles is the village of Bashavar, and, at 8| miles, Bala Shahr, both on the eastern bank of the river; and at 9J miles is the village of Kara Deh, on the western bank. All these villages are surrounded by large orchards, and much irrigated cultivation, and all contain limit ed supplies of cereals, and large flocks of goats and sheep. The river is shallow throughout, except when in flood, which it usually is in the spring ; the depth of the water when in %od never ex ceeds 6 feet, but the rapidity of the curfent—6 to 8 miles per hour—-makes bridging difficult and fording impossible even if there be only 3 feet of water.

It is noteworthy that there is practically no caravan traffic between Bandar’Abbas and Shiraz, although between the former citv and Lar, and between Lar and Shiraz, there is consi derable traffic, between the former two places from about Oct ober to June and between the latter places all the year round. Speaking generally, the route is passable throughout for pack animals (camels^ donkeys, and mules) without much diffi- culty, the majority of the gradients encountered are easy, but the road in its present state is impassable for wheeled traffic owing to the obstacles enumerated below. From a military point of view, the employment of this route for moving bodies of troops of any size, even during the period October to April, is not to be recommended for the following reasons : (1) Water .—From Bandar Abbas as far as Mansurabad (15th stage) travellers are entirely dependent for their water supply at the various stages on water from cisterns {db ambdr). During the months May to October nearly all these cisterns are liable to become quite dry ; even during the other months of the year, as the rainfall is by no means reliable, there is apt to be a shortage of water for caravans of any size. During May 1917 (after a fair rainfall in the district) the contents of several of the cisterns barely sufficed for a caravan of some 300 camels and 300 donkeys, and their drivers. By June 1917, nearly all the cisterns were quite dry. Note.—F rom Mamurabad to Shiraz, water is plentiful from perennial streams and qanats. (2) Stipplies .—After leaving Bandar ’Abbas until Lar is reached at no stage whatever en route are supplies available in an y quantity. No villages are met with, the stages are marked by cisterns and sarai% the country lying on either side of the road for some little distance, may be taken as uninhabited, if the hamlets at Hormuz (8 stages out) be excepted, where only a small amount of supplies could be obtained, a negligible quan tity in fact. Thus troops moving inland from Bandar ’Abbas would have to be entirely self-contained as regards Supplies ; this would necessarily increase the amount of transport required (in propor-183 Route No. 1(A)— contd. lies p 7 Pasa. caravan tap between ( there is c® )r n about (|; e year roui: Joughout 1 it much | ‘ easy, butt: 1 traffic oiii ment of 1 m during tl tided fori surabadflil v r ater supf s ( db mi hese cistei: other fflonf , there is i During 1 its of sew e 300 cam 17, nearly) from per® mtil Lar available are mart le of there bited, ift where onlj ligible f $ would b ; this Wt i (in prof tion to the size of the force) and thus add materially to the diffi culty of adequate water supply. Beyond Lar, as far as Qutbabad (18th stage) similar diffi culties would be met with, though in a minor degree. The supplies obtainable at the intervening stages would be insuffi cient for any body of troops larger than a section ; arrangements would have to be made for laying in supplies from%Lar. Note.—F rom Qutbabad to Shiraz supplies could be procured in very fair quantities ; due notice would have to be given beforehand. (3) Fodder. —The remarks under the heading “ Supplies may be taken as being equally applicable to “ Fodder.” (4) Climatic conditions .—From May till about the end of September, a march over that part of the route lying between Lar and the coast would be unduly trying for troops, owing to the severe heat. Even marching by night and resting during the day would not adequately overcome this difficulty. During May 1917, the heat during the day, even in a double fly tent, was trying, and there is no shade to speak of for troops between the coast and Lar at the various stages. Other features of the route. (a) Fuel. —Fuel is to be found in plenty along the whole route but in one or two stages it would be necessary to carry it. (b) Grazing. —Plentiful during the spring and winter months ; rather scanty at some stages during the summer, animals having to be driven some miles from the halting places. (c) Camping Grounds. —Ample space at every stage. 5. Obstacles encountered making road un/passable for wheeled traffic .— (a) 2nd s l age.—Gardan of sandstone ledges, and narrow defile through low hills, in parts only passable for infantry in single file.

There are two alternative routes at the start, both equally im passable for wheels ; these are I, The Tang-i-Kalun pass; II, the Gardan-i*Muhammad Ibrahim Khan. I. Very deep, narrow gorge, very stony. Impassable in wet weather. Trying for pack animals at all times. Needs 66 gallery 55 work to make it passable for wheels. II. Very rough track, zigzaging up over 2 miles of ridge, narrow and covered with large* loose boulders. Difficult in parts even for mules. Of the two, perhaps the track over the Gar dun is pre ferable. The last 4 miles of this stage also are impassable for wheels owing to the large, loose boulders, and the absence of any well- defined track. * &lt; « 1 (i) 17th stage .—Large boulders* clefts in rock, bad going through stony hills.

At this time greater part of road surface consisted of hard beaten sand. No obstacles of an}^ sort encountered en route ; wheeled transport could follow track throughout with only a few minor detours. Last f of mile (after crossing dry river bed) track is a little rough composed of sandstone ruts, ground rising and falling slightly. Track lies along an open plain dotted here and there with small palm clumps. It lies parallel to Clarence Strait and passes here and there within a few 3 r ards of the water s' edge. Camping ground is a level expanse, some hundreds of yards .broad, dotted with scrub. Soil is soft sand. Bounded to S. by sea, to N. by low foothills. Firewood plentiful but scattered.

After leaving the ——— . . cistern at Band-i-’Ali, 23 m. the road crosses a low •ridge in an N.-W. direction, immediately to N. of camping ground, for a distance of about 150 yards. Track over this ridge is rough, the sandstone being worn into ruts. Could be passed by wheeled traffic with little minor clearing. Track then descends into a valley, flat, and varying from 400 yards to 800 yards broad. Date groves on left. Surface of track very hard and level. Turning N. for a few yards track then enters another broad valley, and runs due W. all the way. One or two minor obstacles, low embankments made for cultivation purposes, are met; these could easily be cleared. Valley broadens out into a level plain, on which is the Birkeh-i-Chistaneh, a dumping ground for cara vans, with a ruined caravansarai adjoining the cistern. Water in cistern was foul and brackish and scanty. For about another miles the road is level and has a hard surface, running over a plain, till it encounters the first serious obstacle in a stage of a gardan with an easy gradient, but composed of ledges of sandstone. No detour to N. or S. is possible. There is a climb of about 50 yards to 60 yards over this slope which w r ould effectively check wheeled traffic though' possibly field artillery might be able to pass it. Beyqnd this ridge path winds through low hills getting gradually narrower and rougher in character, until it eventually becomes in places too narrow^ for infantry in fours or even in file. Here it becomes a track through a wind ing defile, quite impassable for wheeled traffic though more or less level, and quite practicable for animals. Debouching from the.defile the track enters a valley widening out gradually. After traversing the valley for about J mile Birkeh-i-Mlrza or Ambar- i-Mirza is reached, which is on top of a little knoll, immediately to S. of track and about 3 miles short (E.) of caravansarai N. of Gachin Bala (the usual stage fromBirkeh Band-i-Ali).

Heat during the day is somewhat trying and species of biting fly is very much in evidence.. approaches shortly before caravansarai, N. of (iachin liala, is reached. This is at the summit of a gentle rise ; there are two domed cisterns, a ruin, and a caramnsami in good repair. Water from the cistern is sweet with a slightly brackish taste. Grazing, firewood and camping ground available in abundance round this dumping ground lor caravans. Onwards from this spot track runs over slightly undulating sandy plain, abundantly scattered with scrub, for about 3 miles. Road is not very well defined and has soft surface. About 2 miles from halting place at Latidan, however, plain becomes clearer of scrub and surface of track is harder. Camping ground at Latidan is immediately to S.-W. cor ner of date grove, just inside wdiich is the one well that pro vides water here. Well is open, circular and built of stone; and had a depth of 2 feet of water, which v 7 as sweet. To S* are more date groves and a small hamlet. Grazing is fairly good, firewood obtainable both from grove and on the plain to a certain extent. Low hills to S. of plain, higher hills to N. Supplies ? il. This stage is passable throughout for wheeled traffic ; a few ' minor clearances of tussocks, etc., would be necessary, especially on the scrub-covered plain beyond Gachin c, ravansarai.

Road now lies about f mile S. of 2 old ruined stone bridges and goes straight to Jangulf, not bending N.-W. and S.-W. through Baraimi {vide Route 1). , ; East bank of river affords a level approach, v r est bank needs ramping for wheeled traffic, except at actual ford, as it is sheer for about 8 feet to N. and S. of ford. From river, track proceeds over hard, scrub-dotted plain to Jangulf cisterns. These are two in number, water in each being sweet. Also a caravansarai in fair repair. To S. at a distance of 300 yards to 400 yards is a date grove and behind this another cistern with sweet water. Depth of water in each cistern 2 feet. Two miles beyond 3angiiIf track passes Birkeh Daraz, a cistern containing only a small quantity of water. Tank is rectangular and partially roofed over. Hence to Kuristan road is slightly rough, becoming stony in parts. Two or three small ndlds are crossed, all easy of ap proach. River shown on map as crossing the road at Kaleh Puru was dry. {See also Route 1.) Kuristan, about 2 miles W. of this dry river bed, is marked by a caravansarai, four ruined or disused cisterns, one small cis tern containing little water and two large domed cisterns with plenty of water. One was filled to a depth of 12 feet, other had about 6 feet in it. Water in both was sweet. Firewood plentiful though scattered. Supplies nil; no habitations near. Grazing for pack animals good. Ground is somewhat stony. Several fair sized trees are dotted about the plain. All six wells shown on degree sheet were dry and appeared not to have been used for some time. Passable throughout for wheeled traffic. 5 KISTIIDARJ •. 13 m. From Kuristan the track lies over a level plain, 58J m. passing Birkeh Sultan about 41 miles out. Cistern here was dry. Beyond the Birkeh track gets more and more stony in character and crosses several dry ndlds. About 4 J miles from Birkeh Sultan track becomes impassable for wheeled traffic, and in view of further obstacles encountered. 2b1S8 Route No. 1(A) — -contd. fna7 be taken as such throughout the stage. A slight and rough declivity brings road to fairly broad dried up river bed, on far side of which is a gentle rise of 40 feet but very stony. At summit road follows a stony plateau for about 2 mites and then dips down again to the dry river bed which it crosses. Track now rises gently for some little way, dipping again to cross dry river bed at spot apparently called Shib-i-Ravan to S. of which river bed has little water in it. On far side of river bed road zigzags up a very rough and stony incline (quite beyond wheels) and then slopes very gently for last mile down to halting place, which is marked by two domed cisterns and a camvansarai in fair repair. One cistern was dry ; the other had about 4 feet of sweet water in it. Camping ground is stony ; N., bounded by ridge rising up close to road. Hills to S. at a little distance. Grazing scanty. Firewood from scattered scrub and small trees. Supplies nil. A somewhat trying stage for pack animals, owing to loose stones that cover greater length of track. 6 JAIHuN .. 14f m. Track as far as Birkeh — Nuh (7| miles) crosses a generally level, barren, stony plain, passing by the disused empty cistern and caravcinsarai of Taki Khaneh (Takht-i*Khan) at about 4 miles. Road rises gently to level plateau and § mile from this rise cara- vansarai and cisterji of Birkeh Nuh are reached, track being less stony after rise. Cistern water is sweet and plentiful. Several dry ndlds crossed between KishdarT and Birkeh Nuh., Onward from Birkeh Nuh track becomes more difficult and Very stony, winding through broad gullies, rising from and fall ing into dry ndlds, where going is much impeded by stony nature# of track. One ridge is crossed soon after leaving the Birkeh, extremely, difficult, if not impossible for artillery. Gradient itself is fairly easy but rocks and stones are a considerable obstacle. Whole stage is difficult, not owing to gradients, which are inconsiderable, but owing to stones on track. Last 3 miles before reaching Jaiiiun, however, the track is easier, being far less stony and generally level. Surface is hard and good here. Jaihun is marked by a carcivctnsarci'i, * in good repair, two wells with about 2 teet of water in each (one round, the other189 Route No. 1(A)— ^ slight!, ip river If 7 stony, i fes andtlf sses.

Hills to N, and S. 7 SARTANG .. 12J ml From Jaihun as far as • —* the ruined caravansarai 85f m. of Bampan (about 4 miles out) the track is level, sandy at first, then slight gravelly. Onward from Bampan it becomes more and more stony in cha racter, a few small dry nalas are crossed and the road runs along the dry river bed of the Rud-i-Ghuda, crossing and re-crossing it. Last mile before Pas Par Balan is reached is very stony. This halting place (about 8J miles out) is marked by a sarai in good repair with a small hauz (reservoir) in the middle, fed with sweet water from a small water channel flowing from the hills to N. There is a watch tower here, and ruins of other sarais and cis terns. Shortly after leaving Dalan the track enters the Dalan pass, a gorge with an almost imperceptible rise, down which flows the Rud-i-Ghuda, which at this time of year has a few inches of brackish water throughout pass. Gorge is fairly broad through out with steep hills to X. and S. (not properly shown on degree sheet). Its length is about 4 miles and it finally^ debou ches into a broader level valley at Sartang. Throughout gorge no gradient to speak of, going very heavy owing to loose t)oulders and stones. River is crossed several times. In its present state the gorge would present very serious difficulties to the passage of wheeled traffic. Camping ground stony. Sarai in good repair and a cistern with plenty of fresh water. There is also a small stream of fresh water, slightly brackish, running from the hills to the N., through a small date grove near the sarai. Depth of water in birkeh about 5 feet. Firewood scanty. Supplies niL190 Route No. 1 (A) — contd. 8 HORMUZ .. 13 m. Stage generally level , with a rise and fail at 98f m. Bast-i-Kamku (about 2 miles from Sartang) and another just after passing Birkeh-i- Jamah (shown on degree sheet asHajamal). Also there are one or two dips and rises shortly before the plain of Hormuz is reached. Track is stony in character with a few short reaches, of sand; otherwise grayelly going. Several small dry ndlds are crossed ; also small brackish streams. Stage is, as far as gradients go, practicable for wheeled traffic but stony nature of ground would render going very difficult in parts. At Hajamal is a large sarai and cistern which has but little water in it at this time of year. Hormuz is marked by a large sarai; in good repair ; there is also another ruined sarai, a dry cistern and a cistern with some 8 feet of sweet water. To S.-W. are extensive date groves, watered by a small stream. Some hundreds of yards to N. of sarai is a small village where a small quantity of milk can be obtained. No other supplies obtainable. Plain here is very wide and extensive, grazing for transport animals appears to be good. Firewood plentiful but scattered. f 9 BADINI .. 12 ra. Good going, level • —- for about 3 miles over IlOf m. a wide plain up to Bir- keh Zir-i-Gardaneh where there are two dry cisterns. A small smooth ridge of rock bars the entrance to the Bazan gorge which is fairly level, stony going for about f mile till pass culminates in Gardan-i-Bazan which, though of comparatively easy gra dient throughout, is in its present state an impassable obstacle for wheeled traffic, owing to the narrowness of the track and large boulders strewn everywhere. The road from the top of the pass has an easy slope to the plain about 100 feet below ; remainder of the stage is level and easy going over a wide and barren plain. Chaki, 6 miles out, has two dry cisterns. Bad ini has two sarais in good repair, three cisterns, two large and one small. Two are dry and the third has about three feet of water; small, level open space for camping ground. Also one dry well near camping ground.

About 8A miles out, at Chehar Birkeh, are four cisterns, one dry and unroofed tut the others with plenty of water in them. There is also a large sarai. There are two more cisterns about one mile further on, with ver}^ little water in them. For the last 3 miles the track is very stony, the ground rises very gradually and the road winds through broad defiles. A slight dip in the ground brings the road to a plateau, at the beginning of which is Bast-i-Fariab. This stage has a good sarai and 3 cisterns, one of which is unroofed. All had from 3 feet to 4 feet of sweet water in them. Firewood is rather scatterd. No supplies or habitations. Grazing for transport animals fair but not near the sarai. There is also a ruined sarai here and a dry cistern beyond the dip to the E. Bills to N. and S. 11 - LAR .. .. 12J m.

About 6 miles out is a cistern with good water. Shortly 'before Lar extensive date groves appear to S. This stage is easiest so far from Bandar ’Abbas. Lar itself has ample water and supplies of all kinds. Fairly large bazaar. The Ragh-i-Nishai is a good camping place with water from cistern close by. 12 BEH KuH ,. 18 m. Leaving Lar road runs ; through a flat, level val- * 160 z j w. ^ ley, stony in places, for about 4 miles where an easy rise is breasted. Road lies for next m ile over a tableland. Descending from this by an easy gradient it enters a flat valley which gradually gets narrow, and finally192 Route No. 1(A)— contd. ends in a defile which rises gently for about miles. From top of pass to bottom the descent is very steep at first, the road zig- zaging down. Riding impossible owing to rocks and boulders. This descent makes stage impassable for wheels. Track is very narrow and in places has been walled up. From top to bottom of pass is about 2 miles and this is all impassable for wheels except last few hundred yards. Onwards road is excellent, running over a level plain with a very hard surface. Deh Kuh is reached after crossing small ridge which presents no obstacle. DehKuhhasa village and sarai and several iitkehs. Fire* 'wood very scanty. Supplies negligible for a force more than a Section strong. Camping ground excellent—a large flat plain.

Going good though greater part of track is stony. Road runs through broad valleys and one very easy defile. There are a few minor dips and rises 'in the ground. Biriz has a sarai, shrine, and three cisterns, one of which had an abundance of good water at this time. Firewood and grazing practically nil. Supplies nil. Large open plain for camping ground. Locusts have eaten up all crops in this district. 14 SliARAFO .. 13 m. From Biriz track passes oyer a hard, level, 185J- m- stony plain for about lj miles, and then ascends a ridge for about another f mile.

Hard level plain for -——- about 1,000 yards after 200f m. leaving Sharafu, track running due N., thence N.-W. winding through hills, up and down a stony ridge, entering a broad flat valley. About 4 miles out, village of Binaru is reached. It has supplies for a small party, water froirf cisterns ; a fort and caravansarai. Here track bends due N. all the way to Mansurabad, over a level plain; its surface is excellent. There are no stones. There appear to be several tracks on plain leading either to Juwim or to Mansurabad. About 4 miles from Binaru, track runs roughly parallel to a fairly large water channel, which it ultimately crosses a mile or so further on. Six miles out from Binaru newly repaired fort of Fathabad is passed, the water-channel winding past it. Three miles short of Manslrabad the ruins of Jalalabad fort are passed. This stage is passable for wheeled traffic throughout; one point on stony ridge above mentioned needs clearing. Mansurabad has two cisterns, a fort, and a disused fort. A small water channel is close by, with about 8 inches of water, slightly brackish. This broadens out S. of the halting place. There is a village of Jcapper huts here ; inhabitants nomadic. Firewood and grazing scattered but ample. Supplies nil. A little bhoosa, and barley is available from the fort. Open level plain everywdiere. 16 RIZAK .. .. 20| ?n. From Mansurabad ■ ^ track lies over a level plain for about 1,000 yards and then enters a narrow defile where it zig-zags up the west side for about 2 miles, finally descending into a large open level plain about 1 mile short of wdiere the track through the MSICCS 2o194 I Routh No l(k)—contd. Tang-i-Kalun debouches into the plain. This is quite impassable for wheels and is in places difficult even for mules, owing to the large boulders and narrowness of the track. It is an alternative route'to route through Tang-i-Kal€m, which though more or less level, is very narrow and far more stony even than the gar dan. After traversing plain for about 1 mile, track enters a fairly broad valley, leaving mouth of Tang-i-Kalun on left, adjacent to a very deep, steep, narrow gorge. Thence it proceeds in an N.- W. direction to halting place at RTzak, through the valley, ground rising and continuing to rise from about 4 m les short of Rlzak. In one place track dips abruptly down into a gorge at bottom of which there is a brackish stream which runs through the Tang-i-Kalun. Last 4 miles may be considered impass able for wheels owing to the large stones and boulders and absence of any well-defined track. Rizak is overlooked by the ruins of a fort and village. There is a small stream of good fresh water here and ample firewood. Supplies nil. Ground very broken and stony, no level space; hillsides thickly dotted with scrub. 17 DEffiSTIAN .. \5 m. Stage lies through tract —’ ' of country marked “un- 236| m. surveyed on the degree sheet. It leaves the usual Jahrum route almost immediately after leaving Rizak. Owing to large number of obstacles met vdth in track, large boulders, stones, narrow clefts, etc., the stage may be considered as impassable for wheeled traffic. Greater part of way is stony going. Leaving Rxzak track winds through a valley with minor under-features, culminating in a steep ridge up which the track zig-zags. Descending, track reaches a small tract of level plain with an open plain to the right, before re-entering a series of valleys. Half way out, ruined fort and patch of cultivation known as Murdak is passed ; fur ther, after breasting another rise, track enters a wide undulating plateau, thickly dotted with scrub. This narrows down into a broadish valley, and some cultivation and a stream of water are met with, the latter running parallel to track for some little way. A ridge is again breasted and from the top the track, now more or less a bridle path, runs along a saddle with a gradual descent to the fort and mud huts of Lehman, at the extremity of195 ^‘is quit for m* Itisa- ich thoujl oven tk: -rs a fail adjacent! s in an | the valej os short t a gorgei ns throujl -d impas )ulders ai ^ge.

Epitome .-—The route as far as Darab is part of the main caravan route from Lingeh to Taiab,, where it joins the main route to Yazd. It is scarcely ever used at present on account of the difficulties of the route and of the liability to raids by marauders. The country traversed is mountainous and would be impassable for wheeled artillery. Water .—Water is on the whole plentiful. jMeL— Chiefly in the form of thorn and camel shrubs. Fodder .—Grazing appears to be plentiful throughout for camels and donkeys. Supplies .-—Scarce along route except at Tarab and Tar, where they are plentiful. Between Lar and Darab there are sheep and goats in numbers.

The plain consists of clay and sand covered with grass and small shrubs, across which the road, which is firm and broad, runs. At 5f miles, a salt stream is crossed which emerges from a ravine in the Kuh-i-Nimak and flows west. At 7| miles a small caravan- sarai is passed, and shortly afterwards a cistern without a roof but containing good water. In the hills to the N.-E. a clump of trees is visible at about one mile distant, where there is said to be a spring of fresh water. At SJ miles the road quitting the plain enters a broad and very stony watercourse, winding up through a range of hills Which rise abruptly on either side. At 8| miles a small bit of open stony ground is crossed, also a stream, bed containing pools of salt water. Thence alongside the stream to 9| miles; here the stream leaves the road and runs down a valley coming from the east, having its banks covered with grass and a few small thorn trees. From this point the road continues up a stony narrow valley, down which runs a dry watercourse with precipitous hills on either side, on which grow tamarisk, assafoetida, rhubarb, and other plants, as well as a few prickly trees and bunches of grass. Then up a steep and clayey incline emerging on to a watershed at 13 miles. Tins is followed by an easy descent down a stony grassy valley along a dry water course.

Leaving the bridge the track runs over a fertile ano well watered plain which, where uncultivated, is covered with glass forming an excellent grazing ground on which the Arab and Persian ilid-ts feed large flocks. The amount of fiesh whaler flowing about renders the road slippery and muddy in many places even in the driest weather. There are said to be 180 streams in all on the plain.

The track here becomes stony and is joined by another leading across the river from the fortified village of Kuchl, which lies about 1 mile behind in a green plain between the right bank of the river and the western range of hills. Here a steep stony ascent begins along the side of the Kuh-i-Dalu with the river on right hand sheer below. At 3i miles village of Karabas is seen in cleft in hills across river. At 4 miles summit of rise is reached, and at this point a ridge of hills intervenes between the road and the river.

Stage (1) B, is not the regular route, though it is used during tribal ^ migration, and for bringing wood and charcoal into Shiraz, ft is very rough. | and stony, and involves a considerable amount cf steep climbing without saving l much distance. At time these notes were written (March 1919) the greater part of the inhabit- ! ants-of the Kuhinarreh district were in the Carre sir consequently supplies- [ were available in much smaller quantities than they would be at a later period oi the year. Moreover, as in other pc rts of Bars, notably the Kavir and Firuzahad ; districts, the people complain of the ravages of locusts and the depredations of the l Qashqais, which have very materially affected the agricultural resources of the country in the last few years. The improbability that the fruits;of their labours would be enjoyed by the tribesmen, has discouraged the cultivators, from sowing ; more than is necessary for their own subsistence, though the soil is capable of yield - ■ ing far more.

The road at 56 m. first runs about a f of a mile distant from Keh-i-Khurmuj in its general direction over a plain, extending from Kuh-i-Khurmuj to the Kiih-i- Mfmd range near the sea-coast. The ground, gravelly and stony, is thinly clothed with grass. Within 3 miles the road crosses three dry nalas, which run S. from Kuh-i-Khurmuj. At I| miles a low range of hills called “ Kuh-i-Kaki ” lises gradually from the plain at a distance of 2 miles to the S. of the road, and with Kuh-i-Khurmuj to N. form a valley about 3 miles broad. As we advance this valley becomes gradually narrower. At 3 miles the road crosses a dry ndld called Gandu flowing west ward, and, skirting the low hills to S., runs through a defile about 200 yards broad. The hills on either side are practicable for infantry and mountain guns.

At 4 miles G furlongs cross a network of rivulets flowing southwards. These, when in flood, form a shallow stream varying from 100 to 200 yards in breadth. On the eastern bank of this stream there is rich pasture, and a grove of trees affording a most pleasant shelter. The locality and stream are named Bidistan, and would offer a suitubre halting-place. At 5 miles the road, after crossing a mid, with perpendicular banks, ascends from the river-formed basin, which for the last mile it had been traversing. Within 7 furlongs the road crosses two nalas with very steep and high banks. At 6 miles two villages, about 1 mile to the eastward, near the foot of the low tumular grassy hills. The upper village is named Sehu and the lower Kardineh. At 6 miles 3 furlongs we cross a stream called Kishtu, bed 50 yards wide. At 8 miles we are abreast of the southern extremity of Kuh-i-Kaki, and descend into a deep and broad ravine, of which the banks, in places, are perpendicular or nearly so. On crossing this ravine, the road descends by a gentle grassy slope to the valley of the river Mund. The ground now consists of limy sort of clay. At 9 miles 2 furlongs the ravine previously crossed touches the road on the W. side, the E. side of the ravine forming a cliff about 150 feet high,' and the western sloping up to the foot of the Kuh-i-Kaki at an angle of from 15° to 45°. At 9 miles 5 furlongs we cross the very shallow basin of the stream Bid, bed 20 yards wide, with 10 yards breadth, and 9 inches depth of water, flow south-easterly.

From Chah-i-Gah the road trends slightly to E. of S.-E. and runs midway between the river Mund, and the range of hills to the N., distant on either side about 1,000 yards, through a valley with frequent tracts of wheat and barley alternating . with rich pasture, .is we advance, the valley ■ becomes narrower, so that, at 4 miles 6 furlongs, the range to the N. is distant from the road about 500 to 600 yards, 'and the low hills to the S. of the river Mund J to § of a mile. The bed of this part of the river is, by native report, unfordable, consisting of mud and quicksand, with very little depth of water. At 8 miles 6 furlongs the valley has again widened out, the hills to N. being distant about 2 miles, and those to S. 3 to 4 miles. At 10 miles 1 furlong the road, traversing the middle of the valley, pasoes a pond of good iva 1 i i overshadowed by low bushv trees. After this the ground becomes very stony, and slopes gently upwards. Shanbeh consists of about 200 mat huts and a large stone and mortar building, the residence of tho Khan. On the low range of hills, about | a mile to E. of the village, are rivulets of good water. Between this low range and the village a broad shallow watercourse, called Daria-i- Marsain, bed, now dry, about 120 to 150 yards broad, flows S. by W. into the river Mund.

At 6 miles pass through the village of Darwishf, containing about 100 mud and stone or mat houses. Inhabitants about 400. Supplies barley and wheat, good ; no flocks or herds to be seen. Water plentiful, but very brackish. Fuel wood, scarce. Cultivation good. Grazing fair. Camping- grounds good i but village itself commanded by the hills on the S. bank of the river. From DarwishI a foot path diverges to Daiyir S. by E. At 6| miles strike the banks of the river Mind, which are steep and about 15 feet high. The current is very rapid, the flow being from the eastward. At 120 yards from the high banks the actual water channel which is about 60 yards broad, com mences. The southern banks slope up gently for 100 yards from the water to the foot of a low range of hills. The ford in April is about 4 feet deep, but very slightly lower down the water deepens rapidly, and man and horse would be carried away. Having forded this river, the water of which is saltish, the road ascends, and crosses a low range of hills of stony gravel and sandstone. The road, with a little broadening in the case of field artillery, is practicable for all arms. ' At 9 miles 3 furlongs the vale contracts to a narrow gorge the W. side of which is like a wall. This conti nues for 1 j- furlongs, when the road debouches on to a grassy valley. Now cross the rocky bed of a stream, Tang-i-Pallas, 20 yards broad, with about 15 feet breadth of water, and pass through tracts of wheat and barley. At 10 miles 2 furlongs a watercourse called Tang- i-Nakul, bed dry and about 20 yards broad, is crossed. The road now passes the hamlet of Kaxlihi, consisting of about 30 mat huts and a grove of date trees. The rate of travelling for loaded mules from DarwishI to Kardill is 2J miles per hour.

At 16| miles the road inters and ascends for a | of a mile low sandstone hills by what appears to be the dry bed of a torrent. This pass is not difficult. Then descend by gentle slope to the main valley, about 6 miles broad, covered with grass, and dotted with kuvar bush. Six furlongs further reach a belt of date trees, which is entered, and at 17 miles 7 furlongs ford the river Rlz or Baghan, as it is here called, which is about 20 yards broad, 6 inches deep, and flows to N.-W. Baghan is situated at the N. end of a narrow spit of land not more than 100 yards broad the W., N. and E. sides of which are cliff from 15 to 36 feet.

The river RTz flows on the W. side of the spit at the bottom of a cliff, which diminishes in height as the road advances southward. At 2 miles the cliff to W. of the road has merged in the plain, and road crosses the dry and shallow^ bed of a water* course called Kalabadu about 20 yards broad, draining west ward to the river. At 2-J miles ford the river Riz, shelving banks, same breadth and depth as at Baghan. At 3 miles 7 furlongs, the road ascends Kuh Tarjumi, a spur from the range to, S.-W. barring the S.-E. end of the valley. The ascent is difficult owing to its steepness and ruggedness. At 4 miles 5 furlongs reach the summit of the pass (roughly estimated height above the valley 400 to 500 feet). The descent is comparatively easy. The pass is not broad enough for field guns. It might probably be turned by following the course of the river RTz, of which the- 3 u 2260 Eoute No. I (^)— bed being gravelly or stony, is always firm, and the depth of the water, usually a few inches only, does not, Butcher believes, in any case exceed 3 feet, At miles 5 furlongs finish the descent, cross a rivulet called Daria Mxrza Kuh, flowing N.-E., and enter on a grassy valley about d miles broad, dotted with small bushes. In crossing Kuh Tarjumi, the rate of travelling for loaded mules is 1J miles per hour; after that resume the usual fate, viz., 2 miles 6*4 furlongs. The ground is broken at times, and covered with ruins. At 9 miles 4 furlongs the road crosses the dry bed of a nala, and enters a defile between a range of hills barring the S.-E. end of the valley. The rate of travelling for loaded 0 mules now slows down to 2Jr miles per hour. The defile, called Tang-i-IshkamT Kalat, is at first from 20 to 30 yards broad, and its sides, either perpendicular or very precipitous cliffs rising to the height of 100 to 300 feet. At 10 miles 3 furlongs the N. side of the defile slopes up at an angle of about 200. On the top of this slope is a small plateau among the hills named Guru Kalat where a thousand men might encamp. Altitude 1,186 feet. Supplies nil. Water procurable, but quantity uncertain. Fuel very scanty. Grazing fair. Thence the road, by an easy ascent, passes up the defile, which now varies in breadth from 50 to 200 yards, the rate of travelling becoming 2 miles 2 furlongs per hour. At 11 miles 7 furlongs a rivulet of good water runs down the defile. One mile in advance reach the summit of the ascent, altitude 1,556 feet. The road through the defile now descends, and is only from 20 to 30 feet wide. At 13| miles the perpendi cular cliff, about 200 feet high, forming the N. side of the defile finishes abruptly in a broken precipice. Three furlongs further on the road enters a grassy vale strewn with the ruins of houses. Here the Tang-i-IshkamT ends, and the road passes through a chaos of hills. At 16 miles 1 furlong the road runs along the dry sandy bed of a watercourse, about 15 to 20 yards wide, flowing E&lt; ; on the N. side of this channel is a cliff from 100 to 200 feet high ; on the S. are low bills. Three furlongs in advance ford the river Rlz, about 2 to 3 feet deep, flowing from S. to N. An other ^ mile, and enter a grassy valley, which is here about | a mile broad ; ground gravelly, sloping 2° or 3° to the S.-W. The usual rate of travelling is now resumed. At 18 miles 3 furlongs the river Riz flows on the S. side of the road at a distance of 20 wards. The basin of the river, fringed with a jungle of tamarisk trees, is about J a mile broad.

The rate of travelling per hour for loaded mules no*v decreases to 1 mile 1'2 furlongs, the road descending over steeply inclined strata of rock, so slippery as to cause one of Butcher’s mules to , fall At 4 miles 2 furlongs skirt the side of a hill with a deep ravine immediately on the right or W. side. After this the pass becomes very difficult, the road winding in and out of stony ruvged ravines among the hills. This continues for 2 furlongs, when the passage of the first range of hills is finished, and the ascent begins of a bill called Darreh-Kuh. This pass, extremely bad is simply a broken irregular stair of limestone. In hori zontal distance it is about a | of a mile, and took our baggage mules about one hour to surmount.

Crossing this stream the road enters the village of Aslr, situated on the N. side of the valley, near the foot of the range Kuh Zalimh* Altitude 2,097 feet. The Town containing about 150 inhabited houses, and a population, roughly of 600, is covered on the S.-W. side by the ruins of old houses. The fort of Asir is large and substantially built of stone with towers at the four corners. There are 12 cisterns, near the foot of Kuh Zalimi, immediately to N. of the town.

The defile slopes gently upwards, and ■presents no difficulty, till, at 4 miles 3 furlongs, it is barred by an abrupt rise of about 60 feet in 100 yards giving a slope of about 30^ On surmounting this slope, a small level space is reached, (covered with good grass, from which it is possible to see down the gorge for some distance. At this point the rate decreases to 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour, and the pass becomes more difficult ■and rugged, and continues, for 6 furlongs, to rise by alternate ascents and descents. At 5 miles, looking southward down the mass, a portion of the valley and the range of Haftchah is visible between the precipitous sides of the gorge. The pass now be comes very steep and difficult between huge jagged rocks, so close together as hardly to afford room for loaded mules tojiass. On nearing the summit of the pass called Gardaneh Zalimi, the track ascends over smooth rocky strata, sloping gently upwards. At 5 miles 4 furlongs the summit of Gardaneh Zalimi. Altitude 4,430 feet. The pass, called Zarguzadun, dowm the northern side of the range for a short distance winds round the brink of a deep crevasse or chasm, which splits this slope of the range almost from top to bottom. The path is both narrow and 0 steep at times, just leaving sufficient room for . loaded mules to pass. At 6 miles 6 furlongs (1 hour 38 minutes occupied in the descent) reach the foot of the pass called “ Damimansfir,” a erreen grassy spot dotted with a few Aw war and other bush, ground undulating, with low hills round about. The pass over the range Zalimi is practicable for infantry and mule batteries, but not so for wheel transport or field artillery. This pass might be turned by marching round the S.-E. extremity of the range Zalimi, which route, I believe, presents no difficulties.

The road, for 269f m. | a mile passes over a grassy expanse between low hills : it then winds among small hills or rather mounds where the lunar bush grows in abundance. At 14 miles the low hills through which it has been passing have disappeared, and the range Khunj, now sinking into the plain, appears 300 yards to N.' To S. of the road, is a smooth grassy valley about 4 miles broad, dotted with kundr and bramble and sloping gently downward to S.-E. At 4 miles 5 furlongs the ground, of gravel and limestone, becomes stony and undulating. One furlong further on low hills spring up at the foot of the low range Khunj, and border the N. side of the road at distances varying from 100 yards to or f of a mile. This continues for 3 furlongs, when the road strikes and skirts the foot of Kuh Khunj which slopes up steeply from the path to a height of 200 to 300 feet. At 6 miles the road ascends a lime-stone hill (Kuh Kalat-i-X tar). The pass, called Gardaneh Mabada, is very short, but rather steep and narrow, and in its present state only passable for pack animals. Ascend the pass for about 3 furlongs, the rate of travelling for loaded mules being 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour. The ground then opening out, and the ascent becoming easy, the ordinary rate of travelling is resumed. At 6 miles 7 furlongs reach the summit of Kuh Kalat-i-Utar ; altitude 3,355 feet. Here is a grassy plateau, ground stony and gravelly.

After this the ascent continues over rocky ground and is fairly easy, open, and not steep. At 13 miles the ascent-takes a zigzag course in a generally X. b v E direction, till, at 13 miles 3 furlongs, the summit of pass is reached at an altitude of 4,969 feet. The pass, called Gardaneh Khudu leading down to the northern slope of the ranve (locally named Kuh Bunashkatu), although not difficult for infantrvand pack animals, would be very much so, if not altogether imnractic- able, for field artillery and wheel transport. Steep, precinitous' and frequently perpendicular rocks rise from the edge of the pass’ which is fairly steep and in parts rugged and narrow. Having descended Gardaneh Khudu, at 15 miles, pass, near the foot of the range Bunashkhatu, two cisterns full of good water, and a few shepherds’ mat huts. This place is named, after the cisterns Hail Kasim Birkeh. Altitude 3,903 feet. Supplies, nil. Water good and plentiful from tanks. Fuel scanty. Grazing poor. Cultivation nil. Camping grounds good. ' The road which is scarcely, if at all, traceable, after crossing a dry n y li with stony bed and sloping banks, passes down a gravelly slope of about 3°, covered with thin grass. The ground, at first, is very stony, and strewn with huge stones. On advancing 1' mile 5 furlongs the valley increases in width from 800 yards to 1 mile, the track running about midway. The road now passes frequent ly many cisterns, and, at 16 miles 6 furlongs, enters the out skirts of the town of ’Avaz, which is traversed at 5-3 furlongs. At 17 miles 3‘7 furlongs are reached its eastern outskirts. ’Avaz is an open town with clean, broad streets, bordered on either side by small but well-built houses of stone or sun-dried bricks, neatly plastered with mud or lime.

Two hundred and 'fifty yards further on cross the dry stony bed of tCM flow to N. At 4 miles there -is an abrupt rise of about 15 feet ’in the level of the valley, which the road ascends by a shorn slope. Another | mile the road ascends a similar slope, resulting also from a change of about 15 feet in the general level. The road is now approaching diagonally the low range of Bunas! ■ Icatu on the S. side of the valley. At 8 miles 1 furlong the road passes a cistern close to the N. side of it and within another 250 yards enters a defile called Tang-i-Maspd. At its entrance the pass is about 20 yards broad, but at once opens out into a broad space between the hills. Pass by a very good and level road between low hills which are close to the track on either side. At 8’ miles 2 furlongs the defile opens out into a level vale, about fOO yards broad, stony and very thinly covered with grass and 'Small furze. The low hills on either side are steep, precipitous and bare of vegetation. At S miles B furlongs reach the southern entrance of the pass, which is here about 200 or E00 yards broad, lined with hills practicable for infantry and mountain batteries. At this point is sighted, for the first time, the fort and rock of Gi rash. At the S.-W. extremity of the base of this rock nestles the town of Girash. At 9 miles 2 furlongs the road clears the defile and is descending a gentle slope towards Girash. Within the next mile, the road crosses two dry nalds, flow to S. E.RotraE^o.

Proceeding another 21- furlongs, cross this watercourse, very shallow sandy bed about 25 feet broad, flow to W. The fort of Girash is perched on the crest gt a lofty and isolated limestone rock, which springs up from the valley, abrupt and precipitous to the height of 436 feet.

The ground, of a limy clay mixed with a small proportion of sand, is covered with very thin grass, w r hich be comes thicker as the road advances. The valley slopes gently downward from the Kuh Kirmiz on the N. to that of Siah on the S. As the road advances the hills gradually close in, till, at 3 miles 7 furlongs, a spur from Koh Kirmiz touches the N. side of the road, and Kfh Slab is about b of a mile to S.

These strata are broken, so as to form gaps or gates, and run in parallel and broken lines through the .defile .which is called Tang-i-Laghar. At 8 miles sight the white houses of Lar or its suburbs. At 8 miles 3 furlongs the road crosses the dry and stony bed of a small flow to N.-Em that had, for the last 1 a mile, been running a short distance to S. of the track. At 9 miles 1 furlong the defile is gradually widening and opening out. The low hills, on either side, are distant 300 to 500 yards. Advancing another | mile the road is clear of the defile, and passes a cistern full of good water. The ground now consists of a limy, sandy, and stoneless clay. At 10 miles 6 furlongs, passing two cisterns on the S. side of the road, cross an irrigation conduit or ditch, which runs from a large well on the opposite side. The road now arrives at the small village of Bahi. After passing Bahi, the range Kiriniz borders the N. side of the road, at times as a perpendicular wall, varying from 4 to 12 feet high, and at other times sloping up gently from the road. About | a mile from Bahi pass through several fields of wheat and barley. At 12 miles 2 furlongs the road is passing through a labyrinth of irrigation bunds from 3 to 15 feet high, the ground being covered with numberless cisterns, some apparently in good order, others in ruins.

For the first 9 miles the road is quite level^thxigh stony; several dry watercourses are crossed. Xhe valley is about ^ miles wide, and is flanked by high mountains. At 7-| miles the Bagh-i- Diranp is passed in a^ small gorge co the E. . at 8;y miles the valley is divided by a range of hills. The road takes the right-hand (western) side. At 9 miles on the Kuh-i-Seh mountain to the E. is seen the sharp descent of a route to Bushkan. shorter but reported more difficult for animals compared to the Tang-i-Zard route. This route passes back from Bushkan to Deh Beh, then ascends past Tang-i-Rud to Takht-i-Kuh-i-Seh, and descends by the Imamzadeh Shah Pisr Mard, which can be seen from the Taleh Valley, high up on the mountain side. The track now passes through two deep and rocky clefts; and undergoes many undulations. There is a sharp rise, trending towards the E. up the Gardaneh Anjiru, which closes the Taleh Valley. At 13 miles the Tang (Chiz)-Kuchiku is entered from above, an abrupt turn to the right (west) being made. At 14 miles the road again turns S.-W. and, by a series of sharp rocky ascents, reaches the top of the crest, whence a view of a very deep gorge far below is obtained. The descent is extremely trying, full of boulders, and turns and appears about 2,000 feet. At the base of the mountain the track again runs to the W. and enters the Sehdar Pass, properly so called. This is very uneven and winds along the edges of hills, but there is a. gradual descent all the time towards the foot of twin peaks which stand up prominently. On reaching their base, the track follows a stony bed with running w T ater, oecoming very narrow, and winding for about 11 miles, by very tortuous ways, to the western side of the twin peaks. Then the stream is crossed and the bank ascended, and a rise of 1| miles takes one into Lavar, direction N.-W. This march is very trying : from the Anj nrl cliff there ar a several sharp descents, and the actual kutal is very bad and stony, The pass is known as the Burl. N.

At 6 miles a dry torrent bed is crossed, and at 7, a column of ma sonry, ruined db-ambar and graveyard are passed on the right. Half a mile further on 2 small ndlds are crossed, and the road begins very gradually to ascend, till at 8 miles the Gardaneh-i- Ja’ Abeh is reached ; the last 200 yards of ascent difficult but not steep over slippery shelves of rock. The descent is very gradual, down a valley. The bottom is reached in J a mile at a place where there is a ruined tower on the left of the road which commands the pass and road on this side for some distance.

A wide stream runs parallel to it for a, short distance; road is bad ; 300 yards to the top very stony, impracticable, as it stands, for wheeled traffic bub a detour of about 500 yards will avoid this, and, although there is no road, slope of hill is very slight and surface good. The road then continues level for about 400 yards and then descends very gradually round a spur of the Kuh-i-Buraki (the name Tal-i- kaieh-P&amp;zi seems to be unknown locally). On the right is a. mound behind which is a slight depression covering a large area known as the G ideh-i-Kuhak. The plain which is wide and well watered is soon reached, the road, a good broad one, running practically due S. At 4J miles to right a single tower, at present surrounded by tents from Baghan; mile further on an unwalled village of 20 houses, (150 sheep) lying on the lower slopes of the ridge. This village and Fathabad at 11| miles, are both the property of the Qawam. Fathabad is a walled village with 4 towers, 50 houses, 150 sheep and goats, and has a large garden standing in a small patch of cultiva tion. Left, on the lower slopes of the hills, Buraki, an unwalled village of 200 houses, the joint property of the Qawam and Nazim- ul-Mulk. (The inhabitants all go into tents in the summer and feed their flocks up towards Baba Haji, but do not leave the vallev ; they also seem to keep to the E. side of the roan; nocks about 2,000.) Just beyond Buraki in the plain is a ruined village Tasukh, inhabited by about 10 very poor families. There is a little cultivation round it. Onwards the road and plain become more, stony, covered with prickly plants. At 13- mites a stream, running from Fathabad, comes up to the road and runs m the same direction with it until a point 400 yards south of the saraiMO Route No. I (q) — contd. Vfiere it turns W. (N.

Leaving the caravan- — (KHlJAIj. sarai the road winds 56J- m. and crosses several small watercourses, and then descends, and at | mile reaches the Kara Agh&amp;oh river which is crossed by a stone bridge of six ir regular arches. The approach to the bridge is narrow, unsuited to .wheeled traffic; the bridge itself is paved with cobble stones. River runs in deep nlla, the S. bank of which is very steep; it is fordable in most places. A particularly good ford, 690 yards east, Is however commanded by a big mound on the far bank. The road rises after crossing the bridge, up a stony track which gradually becomes very narrow, then there is a slight descent into a stony plain. Route for wheeled traffic after crossing ford, through a gap in ridge to right of mound above mentioned. Road ascends very slightly. On the right are seen the walled villages of Bagha- IV?

(Here a path joins in, leading direct to Kavar villages, running over the spur mentioned above, and crossing the river by a ford.) The road runs slightly winding over a very rocky sur face, with loose shingle ; the gradient is not steep, many trees but the ascent is tedious. At 6| miles the Mak pass (Gardaneh- i-Gir-Bahman) is reached, the last § mile being steep by zig-zags* There is a sangar from which a good view both backwards and forwards can be obtained.

The road crosses a very swift stream, above which, left, a sangar. The stream at first runs alongside the road, which is very bad and rocky ; the ang gradually narrows, and the stream runs down the road, many little cascades making progress very difficult. At several places efforts have been made to dam the stream, and dykes have been built but with indifferent success; At 13jJth mile the road leaves the tang and a little further on is the caravanmrai of Zanjiran, left, in bad repair, built of stones, capable of shelter for 800 horses ; to right, 100 yards further on a little stream bubbles down from the hill, the road is stonv and %/ patches of cultivation are seen -to the right.

Patches of treacherous swampy around which occur unexpected ly on portions of this section would also be the cause ol additional difficulties. Section 4. TUrtiTn to Qumisheh. This is a short section of about 15 miles where the presence of a swift mountain stream immediately bordering and at times encroaching on'the first four miles of the track, which here passes down a narrow ravine, presents obvious difficulties even in the summer months.

The presence of the noxious plant, euphorbia was noted at Qishlap Supplies .—Grain supplies over the major portion of the road would present considerable difficulties Live-stock is abundant at all times, more particularly in spring and autumn when the tribes are on the march. In eases of emergency a mounted force not exceeding 1,500 men and horses could be pushed through by this route procuring their own supplies. It would be difficult or even impossible to send infantry by this route relying on the local supplies which at certain stages, e.g., Baba Shaikh Ahmad, stage 8, and Qishlaq, stage 9, are nil. Kushk-i-7ard or the neighbouring village of Shahr Mian, see stage 8, Asupas and Hinijan appeared to be the most promising centres for collecting supplies but it was impossible to gauge the amount of supplies from native information. Wheat and barley are harvested from mid-June to mid-July according to altitude, Caravans using this route are composed of camels or mules, Donkeys, ponies and cows are used by the tribesmen. According to native information mule caravans using this route (h e., Kusbk-i-Zard or Yazd-i-Khast) vary from 100 to 2,000 mu! es, and camel caravans from 10 to 500 camels. The hire of mule^ varies greatly, but latterly has fluctuated from rupees 24 to {k am 80 to 100^ from Shiraz to Isfahan. Muleteers usual y shoe their own animals.

The Marvdasht plain here forms a rectangle bounded on the S. by low bluffs, at the foot of which flow^s the river Pulvar westward by three great isolated masses of rock—KQ.h--.i-Sharaq r Kaleh Shikasteh and Allan Kaleh which rise like Titanic citadels out of the plain, northward by the Kuh-i-Gharmabad rising above to Naqsh-i-Rustam. The fourth side is cut by the postal road to Pdzeh. The eastern portion of this rectangle is copiously watered by the river Sivand and by artificial water channels drawn from it. The track and this river, after running parallel for a few hundred yards, separate, the course of the river being more to the W. At about 7 miles 4 furlongs the small village of ’iVmrabad lying about a mile E. of the road is sighted and 2 or 3 miles westward the Imamzadeh-i-Dwaz-Deh Imam, conspi cuous by its tall trees. At about 8 m ies the road and river again converge. A small nil is crossed. Shortly afterwards two paths join the track, one from Dehbld, a village about 3 miles N.-N.-E., the other from Ahmadabad or Tmadahad, and Hasanabad, villages lying respectively about 2 miles and 1 mile K-W, At about 9 miles 2 furlongs the road, now trending N.-W., crosses a small streamlet and at 10 miles again strikes the main channels of the Sivand river, apparently an artificial channel, from about 18 to 20 yards broad with level banks at a point where it is traversed by an Irish bridge partially ruined hut practicable. At 9 miles 3 furlongs, crossing another branch of the river by a small stone bridge, the road deflects towards N.-N.-E. and, running between the river on the E. and artificial water channel on the W., reaches at 12 miles 4 furlongs the village of Fathabad about 200 houses.

Just at this latter bifurcation a little imamz.deh (Valian) stands on the left (west) side of the road.' About 2 miles 4 furlongs a drv shallow river-bed, about 100 yards wide, is crossed arid at 4 miles 4 furlongs the village of Khalidapad, is reached. S urting round the W. side of this the road bifurcates at the N.W. comer of the village : one branch running northward over somewhat swampy ground leads to a little imamzadeh (at 5 miles 4 furlongs) standirigat the foot of the imposing mass of rock known as Kuh- i-Mian Kaleh, and from there skirts the base of that mountain on the E. and N. The other, trending N. N. W., crosses a little stream by a bridge and, running under the western flank of the mountain, joins into the alternative road above-mentioned at Hashimabad. The former road is described. For about 2 miles beyond the imdmzadeh it continues to run about due N. passing over slightly undulating ground and crossing several small nupls as it skirts the base of the isolated mass of rocu abo re- mentioned. At about 7 miles 4 furlongs it bends slightly more to the W . and rounding the mountain reaches (at 9 miles) Mian Kaleh, a small village surrounded by high mud walls, flanked b v towers at each angle, situated on a small sweep of level ground between the mass of rock above mentioned, and another mass of a similar nature variously known as Kuh-i-Mallach and Kaleh Shikasteh. Here a path running at righ angles to the road connects it on the W. with the already mentioned alternative road to Hashimabad and leads eastward towards Garniafcad. Mian Kaleh is said to contain about 300 mules. From Mian Kaleh the road, still moving N. N. W. and, passing round by the eastern slope of the Kiih-i-MIan Kaleh and by the western slope of high bluffs standing immediately E. of the road, ascends gradual ly to 11 miles (rising about 250 feet in 2 miles), then descending slightly reaches, about 12 miles, the little village of Earn laid, about 15 houses.

Both banks are very high lle '! and steep. Breadth of stream about 30 yards. The inhablt- wloiif ants assert that there is no means of crossing it here. The road continues to move up the valley between the river, 200 to 500 itaint yards to the W., and the bluffs rising immediately on the E. aft The intervening strip of land affords summer pastures to the bit! Shishbulaki tribesmen. About 18 miles 2 furlongs the ruined onet village of Barlabad is sighted, standing about a mile distant on toil: the W. bank of the river. At 16 miles 4 furlongs a small spring is out ik passed on the W. of the road.

About 20 miles another rocky spur strikes from the E.^fnto the road, which is further cut up at this point by several small water • courses, springs and scattered boulders. From this point there &lt;are two roads to Main. The one turning at right angles to the road hitherto followed strikes N. N.

The other road Hmown as the old road}* turning N.

About 21 miles tire road again invaded by water from juhe and springs and strewn with boulders, becomes, for the first time, impracticable for artil- lery -in fact a considerable amount of pioneering (for which material is locally at hand) would be required. At about 22 miles 2 furlongs the road is barred by deep water cuttings crossed by frail temporary bridges of faggots and mud, wide enough for the passage of one animal only. About 200 yards further on the iivex is crossed by an Irish bridge about thirty yards long and twelve feet broad, stone paved (many stones displaced, footing for mules and horses somewhat treacherous). Emerging on a level sweep of pasture land dotted v ith bushes and passing the village of Bid-i-(Sul, standing about a mile W. of the road, the road reaches Main at about 24 miles 4 furlongs.

The road and the river, or a streamlet diverted from it, are for the first mile or so nearly parallel; then the course of the latter lies more to the W. till it is seen to'lose itself in a gor e in the mountains which here, closing in from the W. and E., round off the valley. For the first 2 miles the road is a good one and the gradient easy, but almost about the third mile the real asoenf •of the pass begins ; the gradient soon becomes steeper, averaging about 1 in 8 with portions of 1 in 3, and the road, strewn with boulders and’ protruding masses of rock, is impracti cable for artillery. The top of the pass is marked by a ruined tower. The altitude is approximately 2,000 feet higher than th at of Im'mzTdeh-i-Ismm M51CSG354 'Route No. I (r) — contd. About 200 yards beyond the tower on the W. of the road is a reservoir of water said to be fed by the melting of the snows. The tribesmen (Shishbuluki Q shq'is) who use this route in their spring and autumn migrations assert that the supply 0 f water in this reservoir never fails throughout the year. From this point the road runs' 15° to the foot of the hills, a descent of about 700 feet in about 2 miles, and enters the Uj-ln valley bounded towards the H. by a range of high hills (still flecked with snow in May 1908). From the foot of the pass the road, deflecting to 63° runs towards Rezl Abad, a small village standing on the N. bank of the river, locally known as the Ujan, but figuring as the river Kur on the maps. Reza Ab'd lies about 2 miles distant as the crow flies from the foot of the hills, but somewhat further up the road which, passing a short distance beyond the village along the S. bank of the river, turns sharply'back. The rivet, which is here about 22 feet broad, is crossed diagonally by a shallow ford the deepest part of Which is about 2 feet. The village of Re a Ab'd (9-J miles), half in ruins, is said to contain 30 or 40 families. It apparently possesses abundant supplies of water—2 qcm~ts and several wells beside the river. From Rez' Ab d the road runs for 200 or 300 yards nearly due W., then turning almost at right angles moves due N. across the plain towards a ruined building. Lalag n. At 11 miles 3 furlongs a qan t crossing the road pours out a streamlet of excellent water by the roadside on the W. At 12 miles Lalag'm standing just off the W. side of the road is passed. Just beyond Lalagun another qm flowing in the same direction traverses the road which from this point runs due N. for about 6 furlongs and then again deflects to the N.-W. At about 14 miles 4 furlongs on the E. side of the river and about 4 furlongs distant from the road stands the ruin of Ujan. No traces of its bridge (Pul-i-Ujan) were obgerved. The place is now entirely deserted and no longer forms, as it is reported to have done in days gone by, a stopping place for caravans.

General direction N.- 8,Q00 / W. The caravan road ™ is resumed at a point about 5 furlongs E of Pal-i-XJjan and moves in an almost uniform direction N.-W. up the fTjan valley which it traverses diagonally in its course, trending away from the river and the mountains which bound the plain on the west, towards the Saiyid Muham mad range on the E., the skirt of which it hugs for the last 2 or 3 miles befgre reaching Asupas. The plain, which at Pfil-i-Ujan is about 4 miles broad, widens out gradually to about 7 miles at Asupas, disclosing the snow-covered range of the Padina mountains to the W. It presents an almost dead-level stretch of pasture land diversified here and there by patches of cultivation and cut up in certain portions by water channels or bits of marshy ground. These* as seen in May 1908, were not of a nature to impede the progress of any arm,but it is easily conceiv able that in the spring time, or at or after the melting of the snow, which according to native information sometimes lies more than 3 feet deep in the plain, the ground might prove difficult. Some small portions of the plain in the neighbourhood of Pul-i- ITjan are cultivated by ShishbulukI Qashqa’g, a few of whom have formed a little winter settlement at a spot on the skirt of the eastern mountains, known as Chashmeh-i-Duzdan, from a spring rising there and feeding a qan~t (Kanat-i-Illahabad). About 7J miles beyond Pi l-i-Ujan is described the little village of Ishkaft,. standing on the W. bank of the river and about 1 mile further on, also on the W. bank of the river, the village of Hasanabad (reported to contain about 100 to 150 houses, 2 mills and 2 qan~ts), property of Easirl tribesmen, who cultivate opium here as well as lentils, pulse,, wheat and barley. The village of Maigan lying close under the western hills and that of Pahlvan, both forming part of Asupas, are sighted in the plain on the W. of the road, Pahlvan being at a distance of about 6 fur longs from it. At 10 miles a spring Chashmeh-i-Salatin bubbl ing out on the W. of the road, marks a bifurcation, the main portion of the road usually followed by caravans running imme diately under the mountains, while a somewhat shorter grassy track leads over the plain to Asupas. The latter road is reported to be swampy and unfit for caravans at certain seasons of the- year. At 14 miles 4 furlongs is the spring of Bahrain Gar 4x3356 Boute No.. I (r) —contd. W. of the rpad. The I’jan valley is the meeting place of several roads. Thus from Maigiin a road runs to Kam Firuz and Simaran, the summer head-quarters of the Hkhani of the Qashqals. At about 12 miles a _road branching off from the caravan road runs in 8 miles to Ab- Barlk. in 24 miles to Iqlid, and in 44 miles to AMdeh. (Native information.) [Route No, 1(f).] Asupas consists of a small hillock crowned with a mud -fort with mud dwellings clinging to it like swallows’ nests. The •overflow of water from the “Forty Springs” forms a kind of moat round the place. There is also a small stone-built tank JSO'X 9' X 4 / ! about 500 yards to N.-E. of the village. There are also a couple of water-mills, each capable of producing 20 maunds of flour in the 24 hours. There are said to be about 100 families, fifty yoke of oxen for ploughing, numerous cows, donkeys and mares. Sheep and goats are not kept, the long cold winters {sometimes three months, during which, according to native reports, snow lies in the village and on the plain) being adverse to these. The inhabitants cultivate wheat, barley (reaped about the ej|d of June) and pulse. 7 KUSHK^I-ZARD * * 21 m. General direction % * 2 * * 5 -■ --- 8,850'. The road leaving Asupas 119J m. in a N.-E. direction passes a mill on the E. and a small cemetery on the W. Near the latter the spring, Chahil Chashmeh, flows out of the hill $ide. The road ascends very gradually to the top of the pass, 2 miles 2 furlongs (altitude 8,700'). A portion of the hill side is thickly tufted with fennel. There is a gradual descent into the plain. At 3 miles 2 furlongs road runs eastwards to Abadeh ; see stage 6. The plain, which at this point is about 5 miles broad, gradually opens out to about 10 miles. It is profusely watered. After reaching the plain the road trends more towards the N. and moves along the western limit of the plain with frequent curves, hugging the base of a series of bluffs (the tops still snow-flecked in May). From these successive rocky spurs project into the marshland, making the road difficult of passage at two points, v'iz . 9 at 9 miles and at 9 miles 4 furlopgs, at which caravans are obliged to take to the marshland for a .short distance.

The road rises slightly to within half a mde of Kushk-i-Zard which is reached at 21 miles. The ruins of a spacious car give the place a somewhat imposing appearance. Attached to this is a walled and castellated mud village said to contain about 120 houses, of which only half, according to native report, are now inhabited’ recent rains having wrought havoc in the village.

W- The caravan rofd, m, 8,„00 , which passes Kushk-i-Zard some 400 yards to the W. of it, runs to Pnl-i-Shikan, for the first six miles in a direction slightly W. of N., crossing several small water courses, some dry shallow n Bs and two° patches of marshland. Immediately after quitting the latter of these it deflects to slightly E, of N, and continues thus till at 10 miles 4 furlongs it strikes the river at a spot known as Bul-i-Shikan The river itself is locally known as the Shik*u and a. mined village standing on the N. bank of the river about half a mile distant from this spot bears the same name. The bridge exists m name only. The river, which is here about 10 to 12 yards wide, is crossed diagonally by a ford, the water being about 3 feet deep, at the deepest point, in May. From Pul-i-Shikan two routes lead to Q-shlaq, the one, the usual caravan road which continues in almost the same direction as the road from Kushk-i-Zard to the ford, the other, a track in many places quite undefined, only known to and used by the tribesmen' Moving N.-W. up the valley, which is here about 4 to 5 miles broad, it strikes the river Shaikhan at about 13-miles 5 furlones and during the rest of its course to Baba Shaikh Ahmad runs more or less parallel to this river, which varies in breadth from 10 to 20 yaids and in places feeds some patches of cornland, or spreads358 Route No. I {r) — contd. itself out over marshland which makes it necessary to be cautious, At about 15 miles the valley widening out discloses in the dis tance to the W. the magnificent Damneh range covered with perpetual snow. At about 17 miles a few patches of barley appear and a little mud homestead, said to be inhabited by ;3 or 4 families only, is sighted about l| miles off the road to the W. The road here skirts a series of hummocks, offshoots of the mountains which bound the plain on the E. At about 19 miles a ruined building, Kaleh Qambar Agha, with a cemetery stands by the' roadside of the E. From about this point the ascent of the road, very gradual throughout its whole course, becomes slightly more marked and the patches of the marshland more extensile, making the approach to the Im'mz^deh somewhat treacherous. At about 22 miles the Im'mz deh is reached, a lonely little shrine roughly built of unhewn stone, topped by a bluish dome. Some tombstones are scattered immediately round the Im~m?'dek and there is a small cemetery hard by. In f ront of the Im^mzldeh is a deep spring with a leather bucket and a rope.

A con spicuous conical hill towards the western extremity of this range, some 3 miles from the track, is pointed out as the source of the river Shaikhan and designated Qabristan-i-Kauha, At I mile 2 furlongs the river is crossed and the ground begins to rise slightly. The distant snow-covered peaks of the Kuh-i-Damneh reveal themselves on the W. At about 6 miles 3 furlongs the middle of the gap (about 1 furlong wide) is reached. A spring trickles across the road from the rocks on the E. From 6 miles 4 fur longs to 9 miles the track, deflecting slightly more to the W. and ascending to a height of 9,000 feet, traverses an amphitheatre about 2 miles wide down which flows a streamlet fed by numerous springs.

The spot, apparently a deserted or half-deserted QSshqai settlement, was variously designated by the guides at Harvan or Arran. At 11 miles the track cresses a stream and moving N. runs over a low ridge, rising gradually to 9,500 / at about 12 miles. Then deflecting slightly, more to the W.. it descends very gradually along the top of a projecting spur of a hill with a nal on both sides. About 13 miles 4 furlongs it drops down and loses itself in the western and broader of these two nal s at a point close to where these two n : -Us unite. Just before this drop an extensive patch of verdure, representing Qishiaq, becomes visible northward beyond the windings of the nal . This might perhaps be reached more quickly and more easily by following the fid d. The track, however, lost for 200 or 300 yards in the bottom of the n 1/1, becomes clearly discernible again on the W. bank of this, a little further N. Emerging from the ndld it runs N.-N.-W. over undulating ground traversed by several deep ndl s in rapid succession.

The track is in places so ill-defined as to render a guide absolutely necessary. The soil, loose sand and gravel, overgrown with turfs of aromatic brushwood, is impregnated with moisture which reveals itself every here and there in the form of a hill, running across the road, or a patch of soft treacherous ground. At the fifth mile a track traversing the road at right angles connects Hanna on the W. wuth Yazd-i-Khast on the E., the latter being, according to native information, 3 farsakhs from this point. Between the 9th and 10th miles high mountains bound the horizon, the Kuh-i-’Ali Jan to the N.-W., the K h-i-Dupalang range to the N.-E. The road, still passing over undulating ground, descends at first gradually (for about miles), then abruptly for a mile through a steep n Id, a drop of about 400 feet, to a broad valley divided longitudinally by a streamlet feeding patches of « crnland. Then rising again gradually it strikes ait about 17 miles 4 furlongs the main caravan road run- ing, according to native information, from Shiraz vi'i Kam Kruz, Dizzeh Kurd and Hanna throng i Hinijan to Qumisheh. This road is at this point and as far as the 22nd mile well trodden and suitable for wheeled traffic. The tw T o routes unite and the road continues to rise for about another mile attaining an altitude of about 9,400 feet, then descending gradually for another If miles strikes across another partially cultivated plain at the N. end of which two ruined enclosures, representing the deserted village and caravcnsarai of Mash, are passed at-21 miles on the W. Almost immediately after passing this point the road makes an abrupt change of direction, running Nd-E. to HinijaD. At 21 miles 7 furlongs a streamlet flowing with a velocity of about 12 miles an hour from the W. is crossed by bridge (of rough stones and mud supported by 3 arches, breadth of roadway 4 feet) in bad repair.

Above the left bank rises the Kaleh Safld. A valley running N. and S. admits a tributary stream (said to be the river Joujak ’) which sweeps down to the main stream in an “ S ” shaped curve. At 12 miles the route crosses to the left bank by a ford 30 yards below a weir which diverts a considerable volume of water to an adjoining expanse of cultivation, known as the Da-dank ; and about 1 mile further recrosses to the right bank. For the next 2 miles the track is bad and rocky; and ascends to a considerable height passing a sul phur spring. Descending again, at 16 miles it crosses to°the left bank where a tributary stream flows in ; and f mile further on recrosses to the right bank which it follows for j* mile.

A short distance below Pal-i-Murd the Rud-i-Shul joins the river which henceforth is known (according to local information) as the river Khas. At Pal-i-Murd is a bridge of solid stone and mor tar, formerly of five arches ; the main arch has disappeared, leaving a gap of 25 yards through which the stream, locally known as Ab-i-Laleh, flows with considerable force, from N. to S.; three arches remain on the east side and one on the W. These support a road 12' broad with a parapet of stone’and mortar 2' high. There are many myrtle bushes round the bridge which is commanded on the E. side by a small stone taravansarai situated on slightly rising ground and capable of accommodating 40 men and 8 horses.

The road ascends this gorge for about 10 miles, in the course of which it rises about 3,000 feet; this portion of the route in its present condition (1910) is entirely unfit for wheeled transport. At 2| miles the track crosses to the left bank. The village of Deh Ramir is left about 1J miles to the S. ; 6 horses ; some sheep and goats ; cultivation, a little wheat. About here there is plenty of grass and timber; and the hills are covered with small oaks. At 4J miles pass a mill known as Asiab-i- Salar, and continuing along the left bank of the stream, the track rises and descends abruptly over very bad ground strewn with rocks. This rise is known as Tang-i-Dukhtar Pari (the maiden’s leap). At 9 miles the track crosses to the right bank and passes the remains of two stone buildings known as the Caravansera-i- Badarag. After passing this, the track crosses to the left bank and soon after recrosses to the right. About 9^ miles a spring is reached, and 3 miles further on another spring of good water, known as the Chashmeh-i-Cheharqash, oozes up from a bed of reeds. These two springs form the stream which flows with some force down the valley in a stony channel half hidden by a dense growth of sedge reeds and willows. From this point to the kutal, which is reached at 14J miles, there is no water in the gorge and the track is 15' broad. From this point the road descends through a wooded valley with fine oak trees, known as the Niwa valley, passes a small spring at 15| miles, and then, traversing undulating uncultivated ground, at 19 miles crosses a deep nald with a streamlet running N. and S. From here a road branches off S.-W., and is reported to lead to Saranjilak. At 19| miles reach ’AlJabad, a half ruined and deserted fort on a mound, past which a stream flows.

The first stage to Istehbanat is over rocky hills passable for infantry and pack transport, but not for camels. Impassable for wheeled transport; mounted troops would have to lead their lorses 8 miles out of the 18. The remainder of the road is level, except between Mian Jangal and Saryistan, where it passes over low hills and small ravines. It is here passable for all arms. One hundred men could make it fit for wheeled trans- ^ 0r In the 9 ^firaf 6 stage, 10 miles of the road is stony and rocky, and in places very steep and uneven. The rest of the road is level, or very slightly hilly. It is generally stony, except near lake Maharlu, and between Mian Jangal and Sarvistan. ' At i3|- mile? from ’MMz (stage 1), where the road debouches on to the Istehbanat valley, it passes through a narrow defile, formed by the bed of a stream, where the water has cut a passage through a mass of rock. The -surface is sieep and slippery and worn into a series of steps from 11 to 2 feet high ; the width is just sufficient for a laden pack animal. After heavy ram m the hills this passage is filled by a torrent about 3 feet in depth when it becomes impassable ; rain sufficiently heavy to cause this, however, is very rare, and the passage is usually dry. r At the Tang-i-Karam (stage 3), 1 mile E. of Tachu, is a tank close under a spur of the Kf h-i-Kharman. There is a narrow track between the tank and the steep slopes of the spur; this track is at present too narrow for wheeled transport, but could be widened by 500 men in less than two days ; there is not room for more than this number to work. _ IFa/er.—Good everywhere, and plentiful, except at Rumz and Mian Jangal, where the supply is only moderate. _ . • Fuel Plentiful at Mian Jangal at Runiz-i- Raia and Isteh- bSnat ; it would have to be collected from the KOI -i-Taduj.

At d| miles the road turns more to the W. and becomes steeper, cross ing steep ravines and stony ridges. At 10 miles a small spring is close to the road, and forms a small stream flowing across it. From here a road zig ags up the steep side of a rocky ridge, the top of which is reached at 11 miles. For the next mile the road is more level but stony, the hills sloping steeply down to the N.

At 12 J miles there is a small tank (full of water in May 1907) close to the road. A track branches off to the 8.-E. just above the tank; The road now follows a steep stony watercourse running, at 13J pules, over a slippery slope of smooth rock : at this point the sides of the ravine are very steep and close together, just leaving room for a laden animal. Just below this point the road leads down to a wider valley. At 14 miles the road passes the end of a rocky spur running S.-E.; here there is a small tank.

At 7 miles the road begins to bend S., and, at 9| miles, passes through the Tang-i-Karam between the Kuh-i-Taduj and the Kuh-i-Kharman. On the E. of the road is a large spring, known as the Chi til Cheshmeh, which feeds a stream used for irrigation. About 150 yards W. of this spring is a tank about 25 feet by 70 feet and about 10 feet deep, filled by qandts from the Runiz valley. The road runs close past the tank under the slopes of the Kuh-i- Kharman. At 10 miles the village of Tachu is passed.

At f mile it enters a broad dry nald with perpendi cular banks, thirty feet high. At 2 miles there are two tanks- on the left of the road, and then the track runs over clayey ground for about 200 yards, and at 3 miles passes between two low hills on to hard open sandy ground, dotted with low table shaped hillocks. At 4 miles there are three tanks 500 yards to the W. of the road. At 4| miles, the track runs through a narrow opening in small hills on to a hard open plain. At miles, a descent commences down a gentle incline over Hard gravelly soil, where there is open ground for one mile on both flanks. At 6f miles there are some huts and clusters of date trees. The road then passes over an open plain. On the lef£ tnere is marshy ground as far as the eye can see. At 8^ miles' there is a small hut amongst date trees called ’Ali GalumI, where there are no supplies, but water is good from a well. The route now lies over low slippery ground which is evidently subject to inundations. This ground can, however, be avoided by making a detour round to the right, which would lengthen the road by about one and-a-half miles. Here the soil is sandy, covered with a surface coat of about an inch and-a-half of clay. There are a few shrubs about. At 11J miles the sw r ampy tract is left, which is said to be dry in hot weather, and the route is over a gravel soil covered with clumps of date trees and wheatfields; At 12 miles, there is a small well, about 10 feet deep on the left of the road. At 12J miles, two more wells are passed ; on the left at 144 miles, the village of Mirakum is entered, where supplies 1448 Route No. 1 {b)—c&lt;mtd* of wheat and firewood in small quantities are obtainable. Water from wells, about 60 feet deep, is abundant; there are at least twelve wells in the immediate vicinity. At 15 miles there are, a few huts, and three wells on the right of the road. At I 51 m iles four wells and a garden are passed ; trees and- cultivation all round ; the route then crosses a shallow water course with a gravel bed having soit banks, 3 feet hign. It tuen runs over an uncultivated plain with a few trees and bushes scattered about. At 16-| m iles there are two tanks. At 18 miles the villages of Ghampeh and Darakum are visible. At 181 miles the small caravansarai of Dui Dun is passed on the right of the road as well as two dry tanks. The route then descends gently over open ground which at 20 miles becomes broken up by watercourses. At 201 miles the village of Champeh is entered. The road is good and passable for all arms. This is a small village containing about 70 people. There are numerous date tree plantations about. Waier.—From tanks. - Siopplies.—Scmty i by giving due noface sufficient for one Indian infantry regiment for one day might be collected. 2 DIN . • .. 211 m. General direction N.-W. Leaving Champeh, the 42 m. road ascencTs gently, towards a range of hills. At f miles it becomes stony, and at- IJ miles a deep narrow and dry ravine occurs on its right, the bed of which is white with salt. The road now becomes impass able to field guns, owing to the number of loose rocks, stones and boulde' s with which it is strewn. At 2J miles a stony, dry and shallow watercourse is crossed. At 2| miles the track crosses a, ravine thirty feet deep and seventy yards wide, with precipi tous stony banks. The route now skirts the foot of a range of hills on the right. At 3;^ miles it runs up a dry watercourse, between two hills, and then ascends gently between two other hills a few yards apart.

At 8 f miles a steep descent commences down a rocky hillside, where there are precipitous barren peaks on either hand. The slope is about 8 °. The track, which is very ■bad, is cut, or rather worn, in the hillside. At 9 miles the road becomes exceedingly bad, a steep zigzag descent of 13 , over rock. A slight retaining wall has been erected here and there at the sharp turns to prevent accidents, Xhen along the edge of a dry stream bed at the bottom of a ravine. At miles the route is running along the dry bed of a stream still descending At Ilf miles the road reaches the bed of a salt river flowing S.-W. This river is said to be always running and it is but slightly salt, the water, however, being undrinkable. _ The bed is 100 to 150 yards wide with precipitous and overhanging banks, 'Phe surrounding country is wild and desolate in tne extieme, and high mountains tower on every side. The road at first runs alone the left bank of the stream which it occasionally crosses. M m miles the river is crossed. The current is slow.

At 6 miles the summit of a saddle is reached.. Here there is a small taravansarai enclosed by a wail which commands the road; a few men posted here could hold the road against a large force advancing from the N. on Bastak. The ground to either flank is steep and difficult of access. The road now runs by a steep zigzag descent into the ravine below, passing in its descent over flat rocks, which are smooth and slippery. At 0^ miles it becomes fairly level, but stony, being cut in the hillside, a deep ravine on its right. At 8 | miles there is a cistern full of water ; barren peaks all round. A road branches off to the N. to Lar. The route now lies down a valley between hills, which gradually decrease in height and widen apart. At 9f miles the road leaves it and runs over a level plain, on which there are a few trees scattered here and there. The going is good but stony in places.

Road through out from Jahrum very good, hlo steep, gradients or stones ; in fact the wnole way is over a succession of plains, rising with an^ almost imperceptible slope. Troops could move easily on this route. The only things to impede artillery are the irriga tion channels which cross the road. These, as a rule, are only spanned by a bridge about 2 yards wide. Some of the places in wet weather get very deep and sticky. Fasa ha? a population or 4,000. There is a very good bazar, thatched in with boughs, with ftream of water running down the centre.

There is an excellent spring of water at the road side here. The track now descends into the bed of the stream down which it leads for a short distance, after crossing to the right bank. There are rocky ridges on both sides. The water in the stream is good. At 11 - miles the road again emerges from the bed of the stream. The road now descends gently, passing a few patches of cultivation, and at 4 j miles crosses a stream, which now follows the course of the road close by on the S. side. At 8 £ miles a spring is passed from which the stream is fed. At 13 miles the road reaches the top of a ridge by an easy and gradual ascent up a valley. The country here is open with low scattered bushes. At 13f miles, the bottom of the descent is reached. The gradient.is somewhat steep at the top. At 14 miles a conspicu ous isolated hill is passed, situated to the N. called Kalat-i- Zangibar, where are the remains of an old fort now uninhabited On the opposite, or S. side of the valley, is a large cleft in the rocks on the main ridge of hills.

The road runs up the 70fm. valley, over rough and undulating ground ; the track is a mere footpath, narrow and difficult in places. Down in the lew ground to the S. runs the river Firuzabad, the course of which about this point is identical with that of the road. At 4 miles there is a spring and a stream of good water, and a garden belonging to the village of Rfidbar, which is situated high up on the hillside, about 1 mile to the N.-W. Here the road enters a defile. Up to 54 miles the track goes through a narrow gorge in the hills. The path is not very rough, but is narrow and winding. The route now lies over more open country; good going. At lOf miles the village of Tidasht is passed, a small cluster of huts lying under the hills, about 1^ miles off the road to the E. The route, for the remaining 4 miles of the stage, lies down a broad valley, through open country, with long ridges of hills on either hand. At 14f miles, the small town of Firuzabad is reached. The town consists of some 600 houses, with a population of about 2,000 ; including outlying villages 3,000. The inhabitants are mostly engaged in fruit-farming and cultivation. Its chief importance from a military point of view would be that it is admirably suited for a halting-place and a supply depot. The heat is never excessive, and the climate generally healthy. Rice, gram, and barley are exported into the surrounding country. There are about 50 horses and a few ponies, hut some thousands of donkeys could be collected here.

After leaving the town __—- by the Pir Shabi gate, 17 m. the road lies in a west erly direction and is level for 2 miles, when a hill is ascended. The first descent overlooks the gardens of Jahrum; a further slight descent opens out on to a valley, with the village of Juyan, m. 7i, perched on a hillock in front. Thence to Bagh ’Ivaz, at 11 miles, the road is quite smooth, but afterwards goes over undulating ground, and across one or two ravines. From Bagh ’Ivaz the road runs through a valley, little more than §—1 mile wide, shut in by high hills, and continues thus up to Hakun. Hakun is situated on a rise at a turn of the valley to the right. Three villages form Hakim: Kalatonhill to the left, Beh and Kunardun. There are about 300 houses. Magnificent and far famed tobacco is produced. In the summer mosquitoes are a plague. The resident owner of Hakun, Agha Farajullah, is a relation of Haji Muhammad Hussain of Qutbabad.

This road is called the Eah -i-Kandal. At 3 miles a salt deposit at the base of a high mountain is seen through a gap in the hills to the right. A stream from this, very salt, runs across the road. Two very deep ravines, steep but not impassable to approach, were crossed. There is gradual down : hill going from Qubbeh, a hillock with one or two houses, passed at a little distance off^ at about 6 miles, to Dasht-i-Dal. While the mountains oil the right hand continue unbroken those th the left fall away, after the Tang-i-Hakfm is passed, in the direction of Ya£g ; Qubbeh and IDasht-i-Dal are in a circular plain perhapS 5 miles across, in which there are many other villages. This is the district of Simakan (i.e., 30 places). Before reaching Dasht-i-Dal at 9 miles, the Shirin river (Mund river, presum ably the same which joins the Shnr river near Duzdagh) flows past in a very deep bed. In December the ford was 21- feet deep, and, the water running very strongly, it was about 20 yards across. Dasht-i-Dal, which is on the farther bank, is a small village. Thence the road is level for 2 miles up to the deserted vihage of Deh Bann. Then up and down undulating ground through quantities of myrtle bushes to Jarmasht, 13 miles, situated at the foot of the Gurm mountain—which now interposes between the road and the Simakan plain. It is a large village with a fort high above the road, and has fine orange gardens. There is a path to Dozeh, 11 miles, and also to Chah Kazimeh about 50 miles, via Kaieh Quli and Deh Beh. Chah Kazimeh is the winter camp of the Ilklanl of the Qashqak From the Simakan plain onwards the Qashqai country is entered and some of the tribe are camped in winter in the valley beyond Jarmasht. The valley is here again very narrow, and the road winds up and down at the foot of the hills to the west, as far as a ridge known as Gardaneh-i-Zafari, which marks the boundary of the Simakan district. From Aidui, a walled village on the left above the road, there is a descent to the tight round the base of a hilh The path here becomes very narrow, in distinct and difficult passing through a small stream, under480 Route No. 1 (n) — contd, a projecting ledge of rock. Badinjan lies on the further side, after another rise has been negotiated, on an elevation in a narrow valley, which projects towards Khafr on the right,' and towards the direction of Maimand on the left. Badinjan is a large and prosperous village belonging, with the next, Behjun, to Nasir-ul-Mulk. From Badinjan there is a path to Babanar (Khafr) about 40 miles, via Gudun and Ta Divan. Water .—A good supply. 3 MAIMAND .. 20 m. The road takes the left • side of the valley, 63 m. which is about J mile wide between the Kuh-i-Gird on the left, and the Kharman Kuh on the right. It is very hilly, and the right side of the valley, where there is gorge and watercourse, looks simpler. After about 1 mile the very fine garden, called Hasanabad, be longing to Nasir-ul-Mulk, is passed. At 2 -| miles Behjun. From here for the next 8 -J miles the track is through scrub, and up and down the whole way. A rise begins as the mountains narrow in. At 10 miles the well, Chah Pilleh, is passed, and thence to the top of the ridge connecting the two mountains is another mile. From Jarmasht the road runs all round the base of the Kuh-i-Gurm, until almost opposite Tarmasht again, where it strikes off in N.-W., direction towards the high moun tain behind Maimand. In front of the ridge the ground is fairly level, and thence to MAim and the direction is nearly due \\ r . At about 3 miles beyond the ridge two sedenta/ry tribes, the Turkeslu and Gunaki are encamped . The road slopes gently down towards the plain of Maimand which is situated at the foot of a conical hill. Maimand consists of 3 villages: Uliya and Sufla (otherwise called Deh ^ Bala and Deh Pain) and Shabankareh, and is famous for its rose-gardens , producing all the rose-water ex ported from the S. It is a wcikj of the foundation of the Shah Ghiragh moscjiie in Shiraz. Behind Maimand rises the great wall of the Sa idar mountain, and from 4 —6 miles before reaching the town the entrance to the Atishgah pass, by which the alfeinat.ve route to Jarmasht or Isfal proceeds, is seen in low hills on the left connecting the Kuh-i-Gurm with the Safidar.

The road leads NS * W. past the eonieaf 80 m. hill which is on the right, and then level for 2 miles till the village of Masallar, in habited by a sedentary tribe of Turks, is reached. Thence the road runs through a valley about 1 mile wide formed by ihe Saudar, or Mainland mountain, on the left and low hills to the right. The ground is very undulating to the left, smoother to the right. At about 7£ to 8 miles, after passing through scrub, the road leaves the valley—now fairly level—and turns to the left towards a slope of the Maimand mountain—here called Kuh-i-Pashmek. This is the shortest route to Firaz- abad but entails climbing a mountain, and by reason of the slippery stone near the summit is very difficult and trying to horses. The better and more level route continues on straight ahead to where it meets the road from Shiraz (coming from KhwajaT) behind a continuation of the spurs of hills to the right. This route is called the Rah-i-Tang-ab, or Tang o. The ascent of the Pashmeli is very steep for the first 3 miles, slippery rock occurring frequently, and giving no foothold* The top is reached at about 10 miles. For another mile there are tortuous undulations winding on the top of the hills, then a very difficult sharp descent over smooth rectangular stones sloping at an angle, and rendering the foothold difficult. Thu state of ground continues to within 1 mile of the bottom where there is a ravine. From the base of the hdi to Firazabad there are about 2 | miles of flat plain.

General direction N.-N. E. Leaving Kuhinjun, 16 m. the road runs nearly N. over the Sarvistan plain, at first through irrigation and then over sand covered with scrub. At 2J miles a channel is crossed, leading to the lake, banks 10 feet high, width 20 yards, a little water in it, the bottom very muddy ; bridging material is plentiful at Kuhinjun. At 4 miles a ruined walled village in the f orm of a caravansarai L passed and at 4J miles the Sarvistan-Shiraz road. At 5| miles the village of ShahanjI is passed at the foot of the Kuh-i-Gunkhuta. The road, hitherto flat and stoneless, now becomes stony and skirts theMaharlu lake, crossing over low spurs here and there. At 8 miles the village of ’AH Daulat, is passed situated in a narrow valley with a few irrigated fields near by. The road now runs inland over a spur, about 300 feet above the level of the lake, the summit of which is reached at 9 J miles. The road now again skirts the lake, at 10^ miles running between the mainland and a rocky spur, joined by a small neck to the mainland. Up to 11 miles, the road runs at the foot of limestone rocks, the Jake reaching up to the foot of the cliffs, the water being a few inches deep. A number of tiny fresh water streams are here passed, running from the limestone into the lake. At 11J miles, another spur is skirted, at foot of which is a little crack in the rock, from which emerges a small fresh water stream which could provide water for 500 men with transport at the lowest estimate. At 12 miles the village of Gandilak is reached; water from small springs and wells; supplies scanty; grazing good ; fuel scanty. Beyond Gandi- lak, two other large fresh water springs on the shore of the lake are met with. At 14| miles, a long spit of land jutting out into the lake is passed, and the village of Gushnakuh comes into view in a small bay, the central village being reach- at 16 totalling a Fuel- Fodder.

Epitome, The road is only suitable for camels and pack transport and would require the expenditure of much time and labour to make it fit for wheeled artillery. It is seldom, if ever, used by cara vans. Stages 1 to 6 run through rough country including the passage of the Tang-i-Zagh. Stages 7 to 12 lie over rather desert country. The route is described as being unfit for wheels but the route described is not the main road, which runs 2 to 3 miles to the south of that given and Preece states that the latter would be passable for wheels. Stages 17 to 29, the road is passable for ali arms. Water .—See information given in stages. Fuel .—From thorn and scrub bushes.

The track now descends into another ndld at ,'4J miles, which is crossed close to its junction with a larger ndld immediately on the right of the track. The ascent from the ndld is somewhat steeper than the descent. The going is over sheets of sandstone rock. At 5 miles, a rough plateau is reached, over which the track lies to about 8 miles. There are low rocky ridges about 500 yards away to the right, and on the left, the plateau ends in a precipitous, and broken edge, which sinks down into a large watercourse on that side. The ground undulates a gocd deal, but throughout the changes of level the surface is always the same sheet of solid sandstone rock. At 8 | miles the track des cends into another large w x ater channel coming in from the right, by a steep and narrow path. This is crossed by a ford just below its junction with another ndld coming in from the opposite side. The track now ascends the latter to 9Jk miles. The bed is some 200 yards wide, full of huge stone, and t ordered by scarps about 40 feet high. At miles the ndld forks, and then track runs up the smaller and left hand branch, which is ex tremely rough and rocky. This ravine leads up to the west of Chah-i-’AH. Caravans instead of halting at Chah-i- ? Ali, frequently stop at Tsin, which lies about 2 miles to the west, and consists of 150 houses. Water .—Good but limited from qandts.

The route now lies up the left bank of another ravine, which joins that just, crossed a little below the road, to If miles, and then comes out on to a rough stony plateau over which the going is bad. At miles a low, long, stone ab-ambar lies to the west of the road, after which the going improves. At 9f miles the track branches.

At 12 miles a small plain is reached, among hills, where there is a palm grove and a water tank, the water runs dry every summer. Close by is a spring strongly impregnated with sulphur. The village of Ginau lies about half a mile further on ; it consists of a few houses ; there are four or five mills turned by water. Water. —Foul from a tank. Between April and the first fall of rain, would have to be brought. Fodder. —Grazing scarce. Supplies. —Practically nil. 3 SARZEH .. 16 m. General direction N.-VV. The track leaves the 39 mt water tank, along a broad road easily passable for all arms. After some palm groves strike north towards an ab-ambar, at 2 miles, around which are a few huts. The water is sweet. The right bank of a broad shallow nald 9 on the right of the road, is reached at 4 miles. The water in this nala is said to be brackish. The Kuh-i-Ginau lies 2—3 miles off to the left, and another range 5 —6 miles off to the right. The track now crosses an undulating upland plain which slopes down from the Kuh-i-Ginau ; the going varies, gradual ly improving and descending. At 8 ^ miles a dry water course is crossed, with steep banks and a stony bed, which joins a river about half a mile to the east. At 10^ miles the track descends by a gentle gradient to a lov er plateau, which con tinues undulating and broken to Ilf miles. From here to 14| miles the going is good, at first over sandy clay and then over gravel. At 14f miles a river, containing fresh water, is crossed. The river lies about 40 feet below the level of the plain, and its left bank in some parts is a rocky scarp. The route now lies up a rocky ravine on to an open plain of sandy gravel. The river flows on the left, 100 yards distant, and on the right is the end of a rocky spur or ridge. Just before reaching the village of Sarzeh, at 16 miles, the river has again to be forded. The village consists of a few scattered huts. Water .—Good and abundant from river. Fodder .—Grazing scarce.

From here the track runs across the plain keeping a ridge continuously on the right. The plain, known a; the Sahra-i-Dardam, is 4—5 miles wide, and is followed for 8 miles. At 2| miles a river-bed with a stony channel, 100 yards wide, is crossed. The road now runs over the stony plain to about 64 miles, where it bends to the left round the end of a spur of a long rocky ridge. On the other side of the spur the road drops into a river-bed which is con tinually crossed and re-crossed up to 11 miles. At miles a small palm grove is passed some few hundred yards off to the left. The open plain of Barak is on the right. At 14f miles the village of Gishan is passed 2—3 miles off tothe right. On the ,, right commences a great ridge of sloping strata which runs paral lel to the track. The river runs all the way parallel on the right to 164 miles, where it is crossed. An ascent of KiO feet is now- made to a stony plateau, 200 yards broad, and having a broad water-course on either hand. At 18 miles the hamlet of Zuratu is reached. It lies immediately under the range of smooth hi s which bounds the S.-W. side of the valley. , Water .—Good and abundant from a spring at the base of the hill.

At 3 miles a ndld is crossed and an ascent made to the top or a small kutal at 4 miles. At 44 miles a tributary flows into tne water course on the left. The track lies down the river-bed which m narrow, and the going bad. At 6 miles the river widens out and the road continues across a more open sany plam. the palm groves of Guhra now come in sig ff. e ir '®, Ab-Mar leaves Guhra on the west, and ma. es for r of Kutabad.

At 12 miles the hamlet of Narakun is passed on the S.-W. 300 yards off the road. Here the valley narrows, and at 12 | miles begins to widen again. The road now crosses from the S.-W. to the N.-E. of a valley lying close under a hill, at 14 J miles. Thence across the valley again over stony ground to Ab-Mar, lying on the N.-E. side of the valley at 16J miles. Here are a few houses. It is better to go on another 4 ^ miles further north, where there is a little water in a ndld ; it shortens the next stage. Leaving Ab-Mar, direction N.-E. the valley Widens out into an open plain bounded on the N.-E. by a lofty range. The road then swings round and assumes a northerly direction, a ridge of hills being close on the right. From here the route lies over a stony plateau for about a mile and then drops down into a ndld by the left bank. A few hundred yards further on, a trickle of sweet water emerges from shale in the bottom of the ndld. There is a good camping-ground on the left bank above this water. It is not stated whether this water is peren nial. The time of year, at which the trickle was found as stated was in the beginning of April. Camping ground .—Good 4| miles N. of Ab-Mar.

The route continues to follow the bed of the ndld for 4 or 5 miles. The E. side of the ndld consists of a limestone range. Thence to 4J miles undulating ground is traversed, where another ndld is entered and ascended for half a mile. The track then emerges by the left bank on to a plateau, and a kutal is reached after a few hundred yards. From here the road descends over an undulating stony plain for 2 —3 miles. To the left front can be seen the point of the range which marks the entrance to the Tang-i-Zagh. There is a rather steep descent fot the first quarter of a mile, and then stony going. At 12 miles the track lies in a stony river-bed in a valley with iime-stone hills on either side. A sharp turn to the left and gradually descend into the Tang-i-Zagh, which continues to 14J miles.

From here to Furg, stage 10 , the route is that given by Preece in 1884, but all through he followed a short cut over a rather difficult track, which, although shorter, is not so good as the regular route, which apparently runs a few* miles S. of the route given : since that date no other traveller appears to have been along this route. The plain here is all more or less salt, very soft, and after heavy rains would be very bad going indeed. It is cut up by several watercourses; 'rains, however, do not bother this part of the world much. At 3 f miles a large stream is crossed, the water of which is quite salt, breadth about 10 feet with a depth of 6 or 7 inches. At 4 i miles another branch of the stream is crossed, the water of which is also salt. At 6 J miles the direct road between Sa’adatabad and Furg is left; this route, although easier, has no village on it, and is principally used by the Hie Is. At 8 miles the road from Tarim to Dar is passed. Route No. 2 ( 6 ). At 10 | miles the small village of Rafiabad, is passed with the village of Karkum, about two miles to the X.-K., both with good date plantations ; about the plain date groves are to be seen in every direction. The road now runs across a level plain with a good deal of salt incrusta tions about. At. 13J miles Said Jaudar is reached, a poorish village with a good date grove.

A long level plain about oO miles m lengti, and some 15 broad ; at the N.-N.-W. end is the Vuluk-i-Fadam ; seven miles off in a northerly direction is tne village or Casht-r- Kanar, and due S. a long range of hills known as Galagan ; this ran ge seems to bound the southern side of the plain for its whole length. At about 24 miles the road gets clear of the hills, and runs over the plain which is covered with low scrub. The road is only a track across the plain. At 26 miles the village of task at is reached which is situated some three nines off the main road. The place is very dilapidated with no good road ; it has, nov el er, a very fine date grove. o THTFIG •• m * General direction W.- ^ N.-W. The road runs over the slope at 1564 . . ..

Ac nnles the road enters a small level plain which is traversed until 4J miles and then the route lies over some extremely rough going over and around hills and up and down ravines. At 6j miles a defile is entered, which is very narrow, with scarcely room in ^ome Diaces for two horses to pass. The hills on either side are not mure than 80 to 100 feet high. At 11 miles the road emerges from the defile, and runs through an intricate mass of ravines and gullies, followed by some low hills to 13| miles, where it enters a level plain, which continues to 16 J miles, where there is a hill on the left of the road on which are the remains of a ruined castle and at the foot of it a number of mounds and other signs of a town.

The road now makes a somewhat serpentine course so as to avoid some insignificant hills. A little further on the road runs for a few miles along the dry bed of a stream, after which it enters between some low hills, in front of which are numerous low mounds, also evidence of former buildings. At 21 miles the road comes out on to a level plain, and about a quarter of a mile to the right the village of Fathabad is passed. At the immediate exit from the hills are the ruins of a large mill. At 28 miles the village of Deh Khair is reached, which is a prosperous place with many gardens and also some signs of its having at one time been a big place.

In good years a fair estimate would be 20,000 to 30,000 T. maunds of barley, bhoosa and wheat. There are many flocks of sheep and goats. Thomdi difficult to gauge the exact amounts available, yet it is wrong to consider this place as one of unlimited supplies, when the main tenance of a column on the march is, concerned. This year (1917) in the month of September nothing like full rations were obtainable for a small column of under 500 fighting men and personnel and baggage animals. Wood is plentiful!

Very shortly after passing this gardan there is a small well about 200 yards to the S. of the road, said to contain good water. Road now descends rapidly and then ascends with a fairly steep gradient to 11J miles when the Gardan-i-Gumun is topped, commanded immediately on either side by high hills. The direction now verges to E.-S.-E., the road descending fairly rapidly to a small valley. At 131 miles this; valley is left, the road verging round a spur of the northern range, the direction changing to E. The road hugs these hills for a short distance and verges out on to the Kaffen. At 16 miles Gomun is reached, or rather where the village of Gumim used to be. Not even the remains of this village are visible now. There is a broad stream of water here which emanates from a large deep pool at Gumun collected by large artificial bands . Water is clear but very brackish. Wood is obtainable in fairly large quantities from the hills close by. Grass in large quantities is obtainable from the banks of the stream. Animals ate the grass well. Camping-grounds extensi s:ef Road in this stage is passable by all M5ICGS via;514 Boute No, 2(^-2)—con^, transport as far as Kalat-i-Khaur. Thence to Gumun is now fit for animal transport only, but with comparatively small clear ing and preparation could be made fit for all transport and motors—blasting required in very few places only. 3 TASHK .. 11 m. General direction E. (Kalileh Rahim The road commences in 45 m. Agha). an easterly direction along the edge of a large artificial bank through high grass jungle. At | mile the road emerges from this jungle out on to the edge of the Kaffen and continues E. hugging the large hills on the N. which dangerously overlook the road. At 1 mile direction verges to S.~E. by S. At 2J miles a large spur is skirted and direction swings round to a little S. of E.v-S.-E. The road continues at the foot of high hills to the N.; to the S. is the KafFen for many miles. At 7| miles a further large spur known as the Puzeh Mishi-—and the direction now verges to N.-E. by E. This spur may be taken as the entrance to the Lashani valley, and has evi dently at one time been fortified, for the remains of an old wall runs from the base of the Puzeh Mishi to the edge of the Kaffen which is usually impassable. This would be a formidable defence to break through if resolutely held. At 9J miles direction changes to N.-E. by N., passing through a passage commanded on the east by an isolated hill and on the west by the main range. Also difficult passage to force if held by an enemy. At 11 miles the Burj-i-Rahlm Agha is met with, situated on a spur which slopes down from a hill on the W.; around this burj are situated some 120 tents. Water here is from a large well which is somewhat brackish. Continuing in the same direction over a very fertile valley at 12 J miles there is an im^mzddeh which is situated at the base of high mountains on the N. The imdmzddeh is approached through thick pomegranate gardens nestling at the western base of a three-peaked isolated rocky hill. Very excellent and abund ant water comes out of the mountains near the imdmzddeh. The whole of this valley is known as Tashk. It is most fertile, turf grass and reed grass abundant: only arzun cultivated. Impossible to report on supplies as everything had been removed. One room in the burj was found to be full of bhoosa. Barley is evidently largely grown. The burj has been destroyed: thus this one land mark has disappeared. Wood appears scarce. Camping grounds extensive.

The gardan is recognised by the dark colouring of the rock on it. The road reported on must certainly be impassable when even slightly wet. On the supposition that the Lashams would hold this entrance to their valley, it may be considered a most difficult entrance. 4 ABADEH-i-TASHK 6 m. General direction E.« S.-E. A pathway over 51 m. a level grass and reed plain. At 1J miles the small fort of Nasrullah is met with —probably about 30 to 40 families. Fort and tents now destroy ed. At 3J miles the Tang-i-Gazi is 1 to 1| miles to the N. through the northern range. There is said to be a fine spring here. The tang is fortified with sangars and is a refuge to the Lasbanis in retreat. Continuing in the same direction and simi lar conditions, at 6 miles Abadeh is reached. This consists of two forts well out in the plain a good two miles from the nearest hills. The forts go by the names of Lutuflullah and Husain ^ All Akbar. Water from large wells, slightly brackish. The only crop standing near the forts was arzun. In both large quanti ties of bhoosa were found but no barley, which was evidently well hidden. The Kaffen is a little over 2 miles to the S. of the forts. At a little over 1 mile to N.-N.-E. are extensive fruit gardens, at the northern extremity of which is situated an old fort by name Taji Kaleh. Some 60 tents were burnt in and around this fort. Again large quantities of bhoosa were found here. No barley or wheat—large quantities of nuts and about 80 lbs*, of rice. These gardens and fort are watered by a jube originat ing from a qandt in the hills. Good and abundant water. Very many acres of jowahir were standing around the gardens. At 2| miles S.-E. of Taji Kaleh is Deh Zir, consisting of Kaleh Agha Beg and Kaleh Naiamutullah (in course of construc tion). From the number of tents and reed huts left stand ing there must be about 150 families belonging to this village, perhaps more. Water slightly brackish, Aram the only crop 3tr2 ■ 1516 &gt; . , - 1 -, ’a V--* •. }' t ...... , r ■' Koute No. 2 (h-l)—conUl. standing. Fair quantities of bhoosa were found but no barley or wheat.

There is a very gradual ascent and at 2$ miles low hills are entered ; a large high peak was noticed 1 mile to the N. Direction now changes to E. by S., a steady continuous rise overlooked by low hills on both sides. At 4 miles the track from Abadeh to Khwa ja Jamali is met with and taken, the direction verging to E.-N.-E The road continues its gradual ascent in similar country, topping a succession of small gardens. At 6 miles direction changes to N.-N.-E. and a short sharp ascent of } mile follows to the final pass which is topped at 6J miles, whence a very fine view is obtained of Khwaja Jamali and its valley. The road now goes in a N.-E. by N. direction, a short, sharp but easy descent into the valley, thence over stony uneven ground, milch cut up by shallow ndlds. At 8f miles Khwaja Jamali is reached. This consists of one large fort and some 400 houses strongly rein forced by stone walls. There are extensive fruit gardens to the N. Barley and arzun appear to be the crops grown. The hills too are cultivated with grape vines. Khwaja Jamali is closely over looked by hills from the east, the north and the west. Good and abundant water from a jube originating from a spring 500 yards W. of an imdmzddeh. Much bh/ Osa and barley were found but no wheat.

The Fort of Jahunabad is said to be Fakr.es-Sultan’s own fort. Water good and plentiful from a qandt. Very many acres of jowahir and arzun were standing. Much bhoosa was found hut no barley. Wood scarce. Camping grounds extensive. At 10 to 11 miles E. by N. of Jahunabad is the village of Deh Murd. It is situated close up to the foot of the northern hills and from appearances has extensive gardens. One part is of the Hindi tribe. Five parts belong to Fakr-es«Sultan; his chief men being ’ Ali Mirza and Karram. All the Lashani forts enumerated in this report have been destroyed. If they are rebuilt it is unlikely the sites will vary much on account of the water and already established gardens. It has been impossible to gauge exactly the amount of pro visions obtainable. It is very doubtful if more than sufficient for their own consumption is grown. The Lashani valley is very fertile and has great possibilities. To open a road through this country would be a comparatively easy matter as far as labour is concerned. 7 CIJAH-I-GAZ 5 General direction S.« ___ E. Road runs across the 723 open plain.

At 3 miles a small white isolated peak is reached and at 7 miles Chah Guraki, with half a dozen wells of sweet water but no houses or inhabitants. At 9 miles a small kutal is reached with a steep ascent for about 100 yards. From here the road crosses the kavlr to Du Dashtak, whence it continues over open slopes until it descends into a river bed | mile before reaching Tang-i-Hanah. Camping ground sufficient for a brigade, surrounded by hills. Small springs of Sweet water—sufficient for a brigade if careful arrangements are made for guarding it. Slight improvements required for watering any large number of animals. 9 9 ALlABAD ••IS m. The road from Tang- —— i-Hanali follows a narrow 106J m. valley and has a good surface for the first 1| miles. It then reaches a kutal with a steep gradient on the N. side for 100 yards. At 21 miles a small spring of sweet water is reached and at 3 miles a large white hill to the west of the road. At 5 miles, a harrow deep ndld, impassable without bridging, comes to within 200 yards of the road. This ndld comes from the hills to the north and bears away to the S.-E. At 6J miles thin scrub is entered. From here there is a gradual descent over a wide plain and then an easy ascent to a kutal which is reached at 10 miles. From the kutal there is a gradual descent to within 21 miles of AlTabad. Before reaching *Aliabad one small ndld (5 feet deep arid 6 yards wide) has to be negotiated.

The road throughont is an excellent one for pack transport, and very little labour would be required to render it fit for the passage of guns. This route would probably form a good align ment for a railway connecting Kerman with Shiraz Bahram- abad and Shahr-i-Babak. The road throughout runs through hilly country, but the hills are more or less detached, and there are no high passes to be crossed. Practically the only work required to render the route passable f or wheeled artillery wduld be the removal of the rocks and stones from the Tang-i-Arsinjan. It may be mention ed, however, that carriages have been known to pass through the tang even in its present condition. During the winter months the temperature frequently falls below zero and it was understood that the road is frequently affected by falls of snow. . Water.- -There is plenty of water along the route. It is Generally obtained from streams of which there are plenty running down from the higher hills on either side of the road. &lt;9mzr»g--There is plentiful supply of camel grazing to be obtained ev route, generally of the nature of low thorn plants.

At about 5 miles the road commences to ascend a low pass, and at 6 miles a spring is passed on the roadside. At this point several roads branch off. The road then descends into a large valley which was said to be known by the name of Chehar Rah. The road then continues to descend this valley, which is shut in by lofty hills on either side. At 11 miles the spring of Chah ’Arba is passed. From 14 miles to Chah-i-Daraz the road runs through a jungle of dwarf oak. The spring of Chah-i-Paraz lies about 400 yards to the right of the road amidst the oak jungle, and at the foot of a low hill, There are no habitations.
