The correspondence is mainly concerned with the rising of the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi against the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Taimur bin Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi, and the former’s attack on Muscat in 1915. The Imam’s coalition included Omani tribal leaders, Himyar bin Nasir al-Nabhani, and ‘Isa bin Saleh al-Harthi, who were rising against the existence of the British forces in Muscat and the Sultan’s reliance on the British in his rule. The Imam’s forces met at Sama'il and led their way from there to attack the British forces’ garrison at Bait al-Falaj. Upon the attack, British officials, the Political Agent, Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, in particular reported on the number of casualties from both sides. The attack has raised concerns of more attacks to take place in the future.Among other issues raised in the volume are:current situation in various regions including Sama'il, Nizwa, Sib and othersprevious rising led by the Imam, Azzan bin Qaisthe communication made with the Government of India about the possibility of sending more troops to Muscat in order to assist the existing ones, and the expenses involved in such a stepthe position of the French in Muscat'Isa bin Saleh’s efforts for peacethe suggestion that the Political Agent, Muscat, could act as a mediator between the two sidesthe possible peace negotiationsthe Imam’s conditions for making peace, including: the full recognition of the Sharia Law as practiced by the Imam in the interior, the settlement of the financial claims due to the inhabitants in the interior, and the absolute prohibition of the import of wines, spirits and tobaccosnews of the First World Warthe influence the Imam has on his followers and his anti-British propaganda, seeing the British as enemies of Islamthe spread of pro-German feelings among the tribes of the Sharqiyya regionnews that the Emperor of Germany has converted to IslamThe majority of the correspondence in the volume is dated 1915.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Himyar bin Nasir al-Nabhani</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ghāfirī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Nizwa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bait al-Falaj</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sama’il</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bidbid</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seeb</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ibadism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sharia law</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Āl Bū Sa'īd dynasty, Imam of Muscat and Oman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārithī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000285#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000285#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000285#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
