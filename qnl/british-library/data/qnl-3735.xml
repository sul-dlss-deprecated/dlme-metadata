We hereby announce to the Native Princes of India that all Treaties and Engage ments made with them by or under the authority of the Honorable East India Company are by Us accepted, and will be scrupulously maintained; and We look for the like observance on their part. We desire no extension of Our present territorial possessions; and while We will permit no aggression upon Our Dominions or Our Rights to be attempted with impunity, We shall sanction no encroachment on those of others. We shall respect the Rights, Dignity, and Honour of Native Princes as Our own; and We desire that they, as well as Our own Subjects, should enjoy that prosperity and that social advancement which can only be secured by internal Peace and Good Government. We hold Ourselves bound to the Natives of Our Indian Territories by the same obligations of duty which bind Us to all Our other Subjects; and those obligations, by the blessing of Almighty God, We shall faithfully and conscientiously fulfil. Firmly relying Ourselves on the truth of Christianity , and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of Religion, We disclaim alike the right and the desire io impose Our convictions on any of Our Subjects. We declare it to be Our Royal Will and Plea sure that none be in anywise favoured, none molested or disquieted, by reason of their religious faith or observances, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the Law ; and We do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under Us, that they abstain from all interference with the Religious Belief or Worship of any of Our Subjects, on pain of Our highest displeasure. And it is Ocr further will that, so far as may be. Our Subjects, of whatever Race or Creed, be freely and impartially admitted to Offices in Our Service, the duties of which they may be qualified, by their education, ability, and integrity, duly to discharge. We know and respect the feelings of attachment with which the Natives of India regard the lands inherited by them from their ancestors, and We desire to protect them in all rights connected therewith, subject to the equitable demands of the State; and We will that, generally, in framing and administering the Law, due regard be paid to the ancient Rights, Usages, and Customs of India. We deeply lament the evils and misery which have been brought upon India by the acts of ambitious men who have deceived their countrymen by false reports, and led them int0 open rebellion.

Our Power has been shown by the suppression of that Rebellion in? the Field, we desire to show Our Mercy by pardoning the offences of those who have been thus misled but who desire to return to the path of duty. Already in one Province, with a view to stop the further effusion of blood, and to hasten the pacification of our Indian Dominions, Our Viceroy and Governor General has held out the expectation of pardon, on certain terms, to the great majority of those who in the late unhappy disturbances have been guilty of offences against our Govern ment, and has declared the punishment which will be inflicted on those whose crimes place them beyond the reach of forgiveness. We approve and confirm the said aet of Our Viceroy and Governor General, and do further announce and proclaim as follows Our clemency will be extended to all offenders, save and except those who have been or shall be convicted of having directly taken part in themurder of British subjects. With regard to such the demands of justice forbid the exercise of mercy. To those who have willingly given asylum to murderers, knowing them to be such, or who may have acted as leaders or instigators in revolt, their lives alone can be guaranteed; but, in apportioning the penalty due to such persons, full consideration will be given to the circumstances under which they have been induced to throw off their allegiance, and large indulgence will be shown to those whose crimes may appear to have originated in a too credulous acceptance of the false reports circulated by designing men. 1 o all others in arms against the Government, W e hereby promise unconditional Pardon, Amnesty, and Oblivion of all Offences against Ourselves, Our Crown and Dignity, on their return to their homes and peaceful pursuits. It is Our Royal Pleasure that these terms of Grace and Amnesty should be extended to all those who comply with their conditions before the First Day of January next. When, by the blessing of Providence , internal tranquillity shall be restored, it is Our earnest desire to stimulate the peaceful industry of India , to promote works of public utility and improvement, and to administer its Government for the benefit of all Our Subjects resident therein. In their prosperity will be Our strength, in their contentment Our security, and in their gratitute Our best reward. And may the God of all Power grant to Us, and to those in Authority under Us, strength to carry out these Our wishes for the good of Our people. 3 been brought upon India by the ien by false reports, and led themPROCLAMATION by the RIGHT HONORABLE THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF INDIA. r f Foreign Department.

Aside from Jones, the two most prominent correspondents are Henry Lacon Anderson, Secretary to the Government of Bombay, and Commodore Griffith Jenkins, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf. Other correspondents include: Henry Young, Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay; Cecil Beadon, Secretary to the Government of India, Fort William; and George Frederick Edmonstone, Secretary to the Government of India, Allahabad.The two main subjects of this file are the condition of the naval station at Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū] and Britain's assumption of the sovereignty of India. The letters received from Griffith Jenkins are primarily concerned with the status of the naval station at Bassidore. In one of his letters to Jones (ff 5-8), dated 18 March 1858, Griffith Jenkins remarks on the total inefficiency of the naval establishment at Bassidore and solicits Jones's aid in presenting this issue to the Government so that arrangements can be made for its repair. The file includes a letter to Griffith Jenkins from a committee which has been appointed to report on the condition of the public buildings at Bassidore. This letter (ff 28-33), dated 18 March 1859, submits the committee's report on the condition of the port, the water tanks, the storehouses, the houses for liberated slaves, the smithy, the hospital and the sepoys' quarters at Bassidore.In his letters to Henry Lacon Anderson, Jones discusses the distribution of the ships of the Indian Naval Squadron and expresses his opinion on whether it is advisable for British subjects to engage in pearl fishing in the Persian Gulf.Jones's correspondence with Henry Young concerns the dissemination throughout the Gulf of copies of Her Majesty's proclamation on Britain's assumption of the sovereignty of India. Included with the received letters from India are printed extracts from the Government of India Act (1858) (ff 54-62), as well as translations of the aforementioned proclamation in Persian (handwritten, ff 43-46), Arabic (printed, f 48) and English (printed, ff 63-64).Further items on this subject include letters, both in Arabic (it is not clear whether the letters in Arabic are originals or transcriptions) and in English, from the Imam of Muscat, Sayyid Thuwaynī bin Sa‘id Āl Bū Sa‘īd, to Felix Jones (see ff 74-77 and f 80), in which Jones is informed that Her Majesty's assumption of the sovereignty of India was marked with the decoration and illumination of Muscat for three successive nights. In addition, there is a copy of a letter to the Resident which is written in Persian (ff 78v-79, name of correspondent unclear). These items are followed by translated purports of letters from the British Agents at Muscat and Sharjah (Khojeh Hiskale and Hajee Yacoob – see f 81 and ff 84-85 respectively), which convey the acknowledgements of the Imam of Muscat and other local rulers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Building maintenance</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000091#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
