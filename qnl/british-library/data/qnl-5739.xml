Political Agent, Koweit. Please see my file re. case of Muhammad Ihnahim hin Saif - which Thn Baud begged me to get settled. The position is this Cray Pacbenzie - say they were ashed to accept 0000/- in* settlement of their claim, but were orT^/io receive it as releasing the father’s house, but only on account their total claim being 6732/- of which V ey had paid out 3,092/- in cash on account of the sons fraud. • The 2000/- is available in Koweit. The point is this — There are said to have been numerous other debtors and. who got nothing at all. If the case was one of pukha bankruptcy and Rs. 2000/- represents a fair rateable proportion of Gray Uackenzies claim they can be told that they must accent it as such in settlement, but before this can he done we need to have a % bona fide list of other claims, which are also outstanding. On your return to Kov/eit perhaps you can take Muhammad bin Ibrahim back and obtain a proper statement of the debtors debts and assets, on which we can issue authoritative advice to Messrs.
