We have been considering means of disposal of such buildings etc#, as are not required by the Governments of the United Kingdom, India or p akistan, but have been unable to arrive at an agreed basis,of financial compensation# Certain of the buildings have however had to be sold and a procedure has been put into effect whereby the proceeds of the sale are creditted to a Suspense Account held by our Embassy in Tehran until such time as we agree the basis on which they should be shared. A difficulty has now arisen in connection with the sale of the Bahmami Electric Plant at Bushire# Just before /Partition took place the Government of India had ordered certain new equipment, spares etc#, for this plant from Messrs* Crompton Parkinson, Limited, Bombay; the whole plant has now been sold and the proceeds creditfed to Suspense Account in the usual way. The bill for the new material has not yet been paid, and the firm are pressing for payment. We can hardly ask the present Government of India to settle the bill while we continue to hold the proceeds of the sale in Suspense Account* particularly since they are reluctant to accept the Suspense Account principle any-way. The obvious course is for the Embassy in Tehi*n to pay the bill^out of the proceeds of the sale, but direct payment is apparently impossible on account of exchange control difficultues# We propose therefore that the United Kingdom High Commissioner in N#w Delhi should pay the firm in Rupees, debittlng the amount via the Accountant General Commonwealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office to the Embas^ in Tehrin who would recoup by transferring an equivalent amount from their S u spense Account to the ordinary Embassy Accounts. I spoke to Kordik about this recently and he expressed the opinion that there would be no accounting objection to this course, provided that the Foreign Office Finance Department agree# There is no difficulty over this and the necessary instructions have been sent to New Delhi.

The only occasion on which we have any specific proof that the Government of Pakistan made clear to the Government of India their views in regard to these properties was in FOREIGN Karachi telegram No.2499 to FOREIGN Now Delhi dated 5th July, 1948 about Kashgar, repeated to you at the time. Our copy of -this telegram was sent to us by the Government of India, who could scarcely deny its receipt. 2. The views of the Government of Pakistan in regard to the buildings in Persia and the Persian Gulf were communicated by the Government of Pakistan to the High Commissioner for Pakistan in India on the 25th September. These views were similar to those expressed in Karachi*s telegram to you No.729 of 1948. In addition they contained a list of the properties required by Pakistan in Persia and the Persian Gulf. It scarcely seemed for us at that time to ensure that these views were communicated by the Pakistan High Commissioner here to the Government of India, as was presumably the intention. 3. Our own standpoint in ^1 h(Government of Pakistan had raised claims has, of course, been rn#*4e clear to the Government of India in re^oji^d conversations, r-^ ords of many of v/hich are extant and can bo quoted if necessary Government of India’s express letter to FOREIGN Karachi of the 10th August referred to in paragraph 10 of Symon’s telegram No.3535 seems very likely to have been a reply to claims made by the Pakistan Government in this regard. ^ • 'I ] r What is, of course, new in your communication to Krishna Menon (see your telegram No,2297 of 29th July) is the suggestion that the Government of Pakistan have rights under paragraph 4(d) of the Rights Properties and Liabilities Order. The whole basis of the Pakistan contention hitherto has, we think, been that that Order was not applicable to these buildings. It seems, however, from Sundarom’s remarks to Selby (see the latter’s letter to Miss Emery C&amp;D/24B of 16th August) and from the Indian charges quoted in the first of my two immediately preceding Snvingrams, that the Government of India have persuaded themselves that tho whole idea of the Pakistan Government having any claims to these buildings is quite new and something to which wo have put them up. t C.R.O.

The substance of his letter has b,een communicated to London. 2. We were a little surprised by the statement that the Government of India had received no communication forwarding the views either of the British -or of the Pakistan Govermnent*-on any of- the points dealt with in the record note of the meeting held on the 4th December, 1947. We were’under the impression that we had at various times made * the views )f the United Kingdom Government abundantly clears*\ «** i: 5 on all points raised at the meeting, other than those contained in paragraph 11 of the minutes which* having regard to the lack of progress made so far in arrang^'or the discussions visualised in paragraph 9 of the minutes seemed to us to be of a some-what academic nature at this stage* Most of the points raised were of a general nature, / H and apart from paragraph If the most specific point which we * were asked to pursue was that contained in paragraph 10 of the minutes. You will ran ember that, under cover of my D,0* letter GD/23 of the 2nd February we sent you a statement on the lines called for in that paragraph* 3. Though it is not our desire to comment on the question whether any communications have been received by the Government of India from the Government of Pakistan* on this subject, it was our .very-definite impression that the latter^ general views as to the principles on which all buildings of this nature should be disposed of were communicated to the Government of India during 1948. For example, I would invite you to .refer to FOREIGN Karachi telegram No.2499 of July 5th, 1948, to FOREIGN New Delhi, which was officially communicated to us at the tine. As regards the buildings in- Persia and the Persian Gulf the views of the Pakistan Government were communicated to us in September 1948, and we understood that they were also communicated to the Government of India, 4, In view of these facts we arc unable to follow the sentence in your letter quoted at the opening of paragraph 2 above,' Ends.

ZXZZ'AZZh' k - ^ Dea^-Qrook, Please refer®to telegram No* X 887 from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in India to the Commonwealth Relations Office on the subject of the Bahmani electric plant, about which we have spoken on the telephone recently* The obvious solution of the problem of payment for the generator and static balancer would be to pay for them out of the proceeds of the sale of the electric plant* Ross^ letter to Selby of the 1st December, however, to which reference is made in this telegram, makes it clear that this course is not practicable, as Crompton Parkinson require payment in rupees, and the transfer would involve us in exchange control difficulties, I am not conversant with Persian exchange control regulations, but presumably the assumption has been in the past that, when the final settlement is made, all three Governments concerned would use the rials they would then receive for current purposes in Persia and the question of transferring the money elsewhere would not therefore arise. In the circumstances it seems to me that the simplest arrangement might be to pay over to the Indians in Persia out of the proceeds of the sale of the Bahmani plant the equivalent in rials (at the current official rate of exchange) of the Rs 4780 which is owed to Crompton Parkinson. This would be on condition that they then paid the bill,and with the stipulation that it was without prejudice to the final settlement or to the rates of exchange to be used when the final settlement was worked out* Alternatively - and, I think, preferably - we might pay over to them the whole proceeds of the sale of the plant on the same conditions. K.R.

The Government of India have at long last replied to the suggestion first put forward in Ross f 3 letter to S elby 247/117/48 of the 1st December that they should pay in rupees tho outstanding bill for the Crompton Parkinson generator and statio balancer (? installation) in the Bahmani electric plant. The reply states that tho Government of India have given careful consideration to our suggestion and have decided that the payment of the bill can bo made by them only after they have received tho sale proceeds of the Bahmani electric plant. The reply also states that -the firm will in any event be paid either in rials or in rupees at- the current official rate of exchange between rials and rupees. Tho reply continued with a request that steps may accordingly please be taken to transfer the full amount of the sale proceeds of tho Bahami electric plant to the Government of India so they may bo in a position to settle the claim of the firm. Reference is made in this connection to their telegram No. 3212 of the 13th May 1949 to the British Embassy in Tehran v/hich stated specifically that the sale proceeds were creditable to the Government of India. / 2 . In- 2 ~ 2 # In regard to tho question of Pakistani possible rights in this matter the Government of India emphasise that they have ~ already informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Karachi tha*, tne right to properties entirely paid for- originally from Indian revenues vests solely in the Govornment of India. Even if eventually there is any question of having to share hoth the liabilities and the assets with Pakistan the matter could, they state, he adjusted direct between the two countries. 3 # It is presumed that the Indian standpoint in regard to these properties as outlined above continues to be unacceptable to H.M.G. in the U.K. If so it is undesirable to allow the Indian communication to go unanswered. We should be glad of guidance in due course as to the reply we should send. It is relevant to mention that having received no definite information that tho Bahmani electric plant has actually been sold we have not yet informed Government of India that the proceeds of the sale have been credited to the Tehran Suspense Account as in previous cases. Please see in this connection Selby*s letter to Harrison 48/GD/23 of the 29th November.

I can find no record in our files that we have agreed to the sale of the premises or that the Governments of India and Pakistan have been approached in the matter, but I assume that as a substantial deposit has already been paid, Tehran have been told to proceed with the sale.

(3) The Persian doV^rnraent wculi probably be unable to jay a much increased price, in view of the difficulties which they have enccutered in obtaining authority to pay the price which wc have, in fact, asked. (N.B. Nearly 8 months elapsed before the Budget ioumission approved the appropriation which has still to be passed by the full Majlis) (4) If the Persian dovernment were to refuse to pay a hx^er price, it is virtually certain that no-one else would. The reasons for which we regard, a commercial sale as out of the question are given in our telegram No. 18 of the 16th o«pte»ber to the United /ingdom High ^umissioner, New ^elhi, repeated for information to Foreign Office.l&gt;Js 4 K v L ' 1 f ^ Crll (5) The longer we prolong negotiations the greater the expenditure on maintenance sill become* iubject to owifirniption“#I to obtain, it m»y be &gt;osj ible to eay that in the present market ▼ alue fs* .a. 1,70,000 last ebruarv, alters was, in fact, working at a figure of ^ials 1,700,0Q0 converted roughly into rup es »t the official rate.

The Government of India agree to the sale of the Sabzabad Residency property in Duahire, excluding furniture, at a minimum price of Re. 1,70,000 (one Lakh anu seventy thousand) or its equivalent in rials at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction, ihis is, ot course, subject to the understanding that the property in question will be that valued at Re. 1,70,000 by Mr. ^alters c.f. reports sent with your letter No .45 dated the 10th April 1948. 3. With reference to the concluding portion of your letter No.247/113/48 dated the 30 th November 1948, the '.rOverument 01 India have enquired, for purposes of 1 inaneial adjustaent, the up-to-date aapital cost in respect o.t eacii ouilding and also the total amount of capital expenditure incurred during the followinp* periods*- ^ (a) Prior to 1900 .

As you xnon, the Persian Government were offered the property for His. 1,700,000 in *.ay last. If, as we hope, the transaction ^oes through while foreign diplomatic missiont are o ily allowed to purchase rials at the official rate of exchange, the Government of India's conditions will have been met. But if, oy an&gt; chance, we are allowed to purchase at the tree market rate again, it will be very difficult for us to ask the Persian Governtaent to raise their bid after all these months, particularly in view of the difficulties which they have encountered in obtaining the necessary funds. As regards the capital cost in respect of the buildings comprised in the Sabzabad property, I can only suggest once more that the information you seek must be availaole in the records of the Public W 0 rks Jepartrrent. I am afraid airt. not available in Tehran, Buahire, Bahrein or even London. As regards the property in Bander ^bbas, I agree that the Persian ucvernment offer excludes the launch and the truck but covers the furniture ana fixtures, for which the ersian Government offered xtls. 123*000.

Dear Fowler, I wrote to Harrison on the 25th January, 1949, enclosing a copy of Tehran telegram Ho, 60, which was repeated to New Delhi, asking that the Government of India should make up their minds about the sale of the Bandar Abbas Consulate and the Sabzabad Residency, Tehran's telegram was answered by telegram No. X175 from United Kingdom High Commissioner New Delhi to the Commonwealth Relations Office. In paragraph 2 of that telegram it is stated that the Government of India had asked their Embassy in Tehran to furnish particulars of the buildings and up-to-date capital costs incurred upon each, 2. I now enclose a copy of a further telegram from Tehran, No. 123, dated the 7th February, 1949, which has also been repeated to the U # K. High Commissioner, New Delhi. It appears that the sale of the properties is still being held up awaiting Government of India's concurrence and that the delay is causing the Embassy at Tehran some embarrassment. 3* Do you think that we may safely assume that New Delhi are dealing with the natter and that we may leave it at that, or is there any further action which you or I could usefully take?

Bunder Abbas and Sabzabad New Delhi telegram No- properties. We gave the Indian ; &amp;bassy material for a reply on November 30th. 5 s regards Bunder Abbas we pointed out that nice accepted by the (rovernment of India included a distinct item of rials 135,000 for furniture. Particulars of Sabzabad buildings and up to date capital costs could only be obtained from Public Works Department New Delhi. We understood that Indian Embassy had telegraphed accordingly- 3. Since despatch of my telegram No. 60 Ministry of Health have confirmed that their request for funds viz. rials 1,750,000 for Bunder Abbas and rials l t 700,000 for Sabzabad has been approved by budget commission of Majlis and again requested that formalities of transfer be completed forthwith. It will be extremely embarrassing if we are not in a position to hand over properties when Persian Government produce the money. Acre is of course no question at this stage of asking them to raise their offer. On the contrary since part of the main building at Sabzabad has collapsed during the recent rains it is possible that the Persian Government will insist on our rebuilding it before they pay up. The cost would be at least rials 30,000. 3. I should be grateful if the United Kingdom High Commissioner could make urgent representations to the Government of India on these lines.

We informed our Embassy at Tehran accordingly in telegram No. 767 of the 2nd December, 1948, which was copied to you. I now enclose a copy of Tehran telegram No. 60 of the 26th January, 19A9, from which you will see that failure to complete the sales may lead to the Persian Government withdrawing their offers. suppose that the delay is due to the fact that either the Pakistan Government or the Government of India have not yet signified their agreement. This telegram has probably been repeated to Delhi as requested by the Embassy and you may therefore consider that no 1 art her action is necessary.

I think that in the interests of the good name of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India the bill ought to be paid without further delay. There is no doubt from our point of view that India should pay since they are the successor to the Government which placed the original order and indeed they agreed to the purchase in their Express letter No.D 1684-1-A/67 of the 10th January, 1948 to Regpu Bahrain. With regard to the rates of exchange which shall cover other transactions we must avoid getting involved in a wrangle if we possibly can and I see no fairer solution than that suggested by Ross viz. to stick to Rials throughout and leave the Conversion rate to be settled when the final division of assets is mads. The exchange rate to govern the payment for the generator etc., is not a serious issue and I think we might accept the Government of India’s views, whatever they may be so long as this particular case is not regarded as a precedent. “ y°u concur perhaps you will inform Selby. XT. kC AX] \s / ' j ~ / ' ' if / -/ &gt;0 I &lt; 7 / r 247//'*748 British Emb TEHBAK. 1st December 1948 I enclose a copy of a letter which I have written to-day to Selby at New Delhi about the tiresome question of the Crompton Parkinson Generator and Static Balancer for the Bahmani Electricity Plant at Bushire. I trust that you will approve of our asking the High Commission to move the Government of India to pay the bill, but naturally if you feel that you can instruct the High Commission to pay it themselves that would be even bettero The question of the rate of exchange to be used in the eventual financial settlement will have to be faced sooner or later. We are having a slight altercation with the Indian Embassy on the subject in connection with the valuation of movables transferred by us to them, but we are trying to persuade them to agree to values in Rials throughout and leave the question of conversion to a decision to be decided later by the two Governments. If,however, you have any guidance for us at this stage we should be grateful to receive it. I hope that you will very soon be able to authorise the sale of the Bahmani Electricity Plant and also the Sabzabad and Bandar Abbas properties. am sending you separately copies of correspondence indicating the attitude of the Government of India in these matters. I enclose an extra copy of this letter in case you would like to send it on to Harrison.British Embassy, IEHRAH. 1st December 1948. 247/' 7/48 HESTHICTED Would you please refer to our telegram No,22 of the 5th Norember about the Bahmani Electricity Plant at Bush ire • The Government of India have signified through the Indian Embassy that they agree to the sale for Rials 400,000 of the plant, its buildings and all the new equipment and spares. This is admlrable,but unfortunately we have now received from Bus hire, to whom it was passed by Bahrein, the enclosed bill from Greaves Cotton &amp; Crompton Parkinson Ltd*, Bombay for the Generator and Static Balancer mentioned in my letter 247/72/48 of the 14th September, particularly in enclosure III. Obviously this bill, which is more than two years overdue and about which a stern reminder has been received from the firm, should be paid at once, but unfortunately we cannot pay it out of the proceeds of the sale owing to exchange control difficulties. We could no doubt obtain Foreign Office sanction to payment in sterling, but probably the most expeditious course, if the Government of India agree, would be for them to pay the firm in Rupees. It would then be for consideration how much in Rials could be credited to the Government of India in the Suspense Account at Tehran, in other words, whether the transaction could be accorded at the official or the free market rate of exchange. If you see no objection, would you kindly approach the Government of India in this sense. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fisher at the Foreign Office, with an extra copy for Harrison. (Sgd.)

The first of these telegrams dealt with the disposal of the Bahmani Electric Plant, and the second with the disposal of the Sabzabad Residency and the Bunder Abbas Consulate. 2. I now enclose a copy of the telegram which the Government of India have sent to their Embassy in Tehran, giving their reply on all these subjects. 14%. have sent a telegram to the Embassy in Tehran informing them of the existence of thAifr reply so that there is no further action which need be taken as far as they are concerned. It will, however, be noted that the Government of India in their reply 'accept'two of the offers' rather than agree to them. They use this formula as they have never recognised the necessity for holding the proceeds of these sales in a Suspense Account, and will not formally agree that we have any right to adopt this procedure, but they know well enough that when they agree to the sale of any of these properties the proceeds will, in fact, be held in the Suspense Account,and the form is that, in informing them that the sales have been concluded, we say that the proceeds have gone into the Suspense Account^ and the Government of India acquiesce by not replying. 3. In this connection I enclose a copy of my letter to Krishnaswamy which you authorised us in your telegram No. 3060 of the l6th November to send in connection with the Kerman property.

Bushire Vice-Consulate telegram B/2 of 3*1*48. I enclose copies of the correspondence cited in the margin relating to the Electric Plant and to two con signments of new machinery and spare parts for it ordered by the Indian Public Works Department, Persian Gulf Section, from England in 1946 - 47 . A short account of the action taken by this Enbassy regarding the Plant will be found at paragraph 7 (viii) of the memorandum enclosed with our Chancery letter 35/85/48 of the 7th June 1948. The \ existing Plant is describe^ r/ in Mr* Walters' Valuation A Report, a copy of which is appended for convenience of reference (Enclosure I.). Prom the enclosed correspondence it will be seen that, at the end of March last, when we began to negotiate with the Persian Ministry of Health for the safe of the Sabzabad Residency together with the Bahmani Plant, we had no knowledge of the existence of even the first consignment of new e quipment. that mentioned in Political Resident's Express letter 56 -IIP 962 of the 27 th September 1947 (Enclosure IH.) For some reason best known to themselves, the Political Resident's Office when (as described in our memorandum referred to above) we asked them for copies of correspondence relevant to the whole of the Plant, omitted from the papers they sent us all reference to the Crompton Parkinson Generator and Static Balancer. We did not learn of the existence of this new equipment until 12th June, when we received copies of correspondence about it from the Government of India (Enclosures III to VI). As for the second consignment, although B*W* Selby, Esq*, 2eul £ 6 Kingdom High Commissioner, /theCV C\ i the political Resiaent mentionea it in the thirci paragraph of hie telegram Ko.89 of the 5 th July (Enclosure VIII), we did not get details until we received Vice-Consul Bushire^ despatch No. V/ 3 A 0 of the IJth July (Enclosure IX). Needless to say, if Sir C. Skrine had known when he interviewed Dr» Naficy on the 2 bth March that new equipment costing over £?00 c#i.f. Bush ire had arrived and would have to be sold with the Plant, he would not have offered the latter to the Ministry of Health for Rls. 200,000. When at last, in July, we did come into possession of the whole picture we had to decide what to do. It was evident*- (a) that we could not sell the Persian Government a plant of which the generators were “worn out and liable to a sudden b^eakdown ,, (see Enclosure II)j (b) that the private offers already received by the Political Resident, one for Rls. 300,000 and the other for Rls. 382 &gt;000, almost certainly included the new equipment. We had already tried to verify (b) from the Political Resident in our telegram ho. Jo of the 30 th lay (Enclosure VI) but the reply had not been clear; the Political Resident's ”Yes M in his telegram No. 89 of the J'th July (Enclosure VII) seemed to refer to the lower offer of Rls. 300,000 only. We do not yet know for certain, althou^i* we strongly suspect, that the higher offer of 382,000 from the Etemadieh Mills included both the consignments of new equipment. In these circumstances the only course open to us, in view of our promise of the plant to the Ministry of Health, was to write to them as we did on the 19 th August (Enclosure X). ,/e have heard recently that the Council of Ministers has approved the purchase by the Ministry of Health of both the Bushire Residency and the Bandar Abbas Consulate, but in spite of reminders we have not yet had anything in writing from the Persian Government. Efforts are being made to expedite the matter; meanwhile, we trust that trie Government of India will approve the action taken. In this connection, I may mention that the Government ^bf India accepted the Etemadieh Mills' offer on the strength of Political Resident's telegram A/1Q6 of the 14th March 1948; but that telegram stated incorrectly that the Persian Government were not interested in the plant, although the Persian Minister of Health during his visit to Bush ire in November last had informed the Acting Vice-Consul that he wished to buy it along with the Sabzabad Residency. The Government of India can hardly eaqpect that the plant as it is, without the new equipment, will fetch so large a price as Rls. 382,OOC, considering that the generators are worn out and that, as stated in telegram No. B/2 of the 3rd January 1948 from His Majesty's Vice-Consul Bushire to the Political Resident (Enclosure XI), the total book value of the electric plant inclusive of installation charges is only Rupees 16,706. we should be grateful, therefore, if you could explain to the Government of India, in reply to the cciuaunication quoted in paragraph 1 of your telegram of the 2oth June&gt; that the Persian Government have been invited - (a) to offer /Rls. 1,700,000Hla. 1)700)000 for the Sabzabad Residency alone plus Rls« 200.000 for the Bahmanl Plant as it stands plus roughly Kls. 162)000 for the Cross}ton Parkinson Generator, Static Balancer and spares, or (b) to let the Bahmanl Plant plus the C«P* Generator etc* be sold to another buyer* Will you please do your best to secure GoTernnent of Ixtiia approval of our . action and authority to dispose of the property in question in accordance with the choice of the Persian Government as between (a) and (b)?* I am sending copies of this letter to Fisher at the Foreign Office (for the Comnonwealth Relations Office) and to the Office of the High Commissioner at Karachi* (Sgd.)

There is one point which ocours to me with reference to Cofiinonwealth delations Office telegram No. 957 of 13th March to the United Kingdom High Comuiosiork r in xndia ah out the upkeep of consular buildings in Persia until they are disposed of, and that is the qpeation of coat. At the new posts of Meshed, Ithorramshahr and Bushire for which we have taken over direct financial responsibility from 15th august, 194-7# the dovernti^nt of India have agreed to share the expense in moieties until they set t^p tteir own posts there. At Birjand, dabul, Ktnaan and Bandar abbas (all of which are being closed) we are sharing the cost of caretakers with the 3-ovemnent of India. .. ou may wish to ask the dovemtient of India to pay part of the cost of maintaining these buildings (at any rate those ms do not wish to keep) in the same way and I therefore thought you would like to know what arrange bent© we had already made for sharing the staff expenses. On the other hand it may be to our advantage to iTiake no claim in respect of your expenses, but you and Harrison have probably already considered this. I am sending a copy of this letter to Harrison. Yours sincerely, (J^i. Fisher) P. Jenkins, ilsq..

With reference to the observations regarding capital expenditure in recent years at Bushire which I premised at the meeting of the 19th March, these refer to the notes in the accounts of expenditure at Consular posts prepared by the Government of India for the years 1943,194k and 1945 indicating expenditure on oi*iginal works at Bushire, In the correspondence with MroJejpes of your accounts division (A.E*3643A7l9l) relating to the adjustment for the war years, we mentioned this point and indicated that it would be for later adjustment. It is now thought that to introduce it into the discussion regarding the original capital cost of buildings would add to an already oonplicated story. Are you interested any further or will the matter be passed to you if we resume the correspondence with your accounts division? -slf so, I will let you have the details directo ^ u&gt; '' ex5 ’ Tours sincerely.
