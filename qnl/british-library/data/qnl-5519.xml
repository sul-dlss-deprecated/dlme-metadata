I. INDIA DIRECT confibential M ^ ^i THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS-BJBITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IN confirmation of my telegram No. 144 of the 27th M ay, I have the honour to inform you that the''Sheikh 'of Mohammerah, Sheikh Sir Khazal Jabir, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., died during the night of the 24th/25th May, at his Tehran house. The local newspapers announced the fact on the following day, adding that the body had been interred at the cemetery- of Imamzadeh Abdullah. I forthwith sent a suitable letter of condolence, accom panied by cards from various members of the staff of this Legation, to the eldest locally residing son, Abdul Hamid. 2. The last member of this Legation to see the sheikh alive was the oriental secretary, who went to his house on the 22nd May in order to pay him a sum of money due on account of the rent of His Majesty s vice-consulate house at Khorramshahr, which belonged to the deceased. Mr. Trott found the sheikh fairly cheerful, in just the same state as he has been for the last two years—that is, he was in bed, sitting up. His hair seemed to have become whiter, and he complained of trouble with his eyes, which were protected by dark glasses. But he spoke of plans for going up-country for the summer, and reproached Mr. Trott for not having been to see him oftener. He made no allusion to his situation vis-a-vis either his own or His Majesty s Government. 3. No reply has hitherto been received to my letter of condolence. For this reason the munshi bashi of this Legation was sent to make any enquiries that he could from Muhandis-ul-Mamalik, who has been the sheikh’s agent for some years. Muhandis-ul-Mamalik told Mr. Naimy this morning that, as far as he could ascertain, the circumstances of the sheikh’s decease were as follows:— 4. For some time past detectives have been, at the sheikh s request, stationed at the outer door of his house in order to keep away the sheikh s traitorous son Abdullah and some other persons which the sheikh did not desire to see. On Sunday night, the 24th May, Abdullah somehow entered the house. He tried to go to his father, but w T as stopped by one of the sheikh s personal servants. A wordy dispute ensued, the detectives appeared; other servants joined in ; and finally all the disputants, including Abdullah, were taken to the police station and interrogated. They were not released till late at night. During that night, therefore, the house was practically denuded of its ordinary staff of servants. 5. In the morning it was noticed that the sheikh gave no reply when a servant knocked at his door. His habit being to rise early, it was thought that he must have overslept for once; an hour later a forced entry was made and he was found to be dead. Dr. Luqman, who had been attending him for some time, was immediately summoned and said that life had been extinct for about eight hours. It is thought that he died from a sudden stroke. Possibly this stroke was caused by the commotion of the night before. If so, Abdullah, the sheikh’s evil genius so often in the past, finally caused his father’s death. 6. So ends the sheikh’s eleven years’ enforced stay in Tehran. The assurances which His Majesty’s Government gave him do not, as far as I understand, extend in any way to his heirs. The Iranian Government, and more especially its present ruler, have repeatedly broken their solemn promises to the deceased; but I do not suppose that that fact weighs heavily on PERSIA.

Hi© Majesty*s Government have been anxious for aome time to acquire the site known as the ^Bheikh of ,, Moham®erah , s site 4 * on the left hank of the Biver Karun at Ahwaz with a view to building a Consulate on it, but they have hitherto been, and still art, unable t buy the property because the question of its ownership has not been clearly decided. Hie Majesty’s Government will not buy the site until they receive a report from Hie 'ajesty’s Minister at fehrtm to the effect that, after careful consultation with the competent Persian authorities, he considers that a olear and incontestable title to the site in Persian law haa been established by the party offering it for sale. If in course of time such a report were received from His Majesty*s Minister, and His Majesty*a Government were to buy the site from the heirs of the Haji Mbin or from anybody else, they would naturally wish to be protected from any risk of the Sheikh Khasal*e subsequently establishing a title to the property H.’«.

As Sheikh Khaaal is aware, Hia Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Oovemmen of India do not admit that they are under any legal obligation to pay him anything at all. The Sheikh’e signing the suggested undertaking which would not be published to anybody except officials of His f'ajesty’a Government, would not preclude hie taking any action he might think fit to establish his claim to the property before it had been bought by His Majesty’s Government, nor would it afterwards preclude hie suing the vendor for damages. It would only preclude his acting against His Majesty’s Government - a contingency which would be most unlikely to arise *md probably could not in any event do so under Persian law. 5.

P.Z.1466/35. politi cal Department* Please see the previous minutes at P.Z.7282/34 and 4512/34 and the Foreign Office letter of 2nd March below enclosing a copy of a despatch of 11th January from H.M.Minister at Tehran, and a draft of the instructions which the Foreign Office propose to send to Mr.Knatchbull-Hugessen in reply. It will be remembered that it was proposed by the Treasury and the Government of India that, as a condition of refunding to the Sheikh of Mohammerah the Rs.50,000 advanced by him in 1924 towards the building of a Consulate at Ahwaz, the Sheikh should waive all further claims in respect of the Consular site, the foundations of the unfinished Consulate and the unused building materials. From Mr.Knatchbull-Hugessen 1 s despatch of 11th January it will be seen that while the Sheikh is prepared to give a receipt in full settlement of the advance made by him and of any interest which he had in the building, he says that he cannot waive his claim to the actual site which he still regards as his property. The Sheikh has taken up this attitude in spite of the fact that he halt previously admitted that his title to the site was not valid and that he is not prepared to contest an application filed by the heirs of the Muin-ut- Tujjar for the registration of the land as t heir property. It appears that the Sheikh is afraid that by abandoning his claim to this site he may prejudice his claim to a number of other properties. The Foreign Office still hope to be able to buy the land and build a new Consulate on it as soon as they are able to obtain a proper title to it under Persian law, and they therefore wish to guard against the perhaps somewhat remote contingency of the Sheikh subsequently being able to establish a title to 2956 6000 7 34 the/the property and evicting them from it or otherwise disturbing their possession. In these circumstances the Foreign Office propose to instruct the Minister to explain to the Sheikh that it is for this reason alone that they wish to obtain from him an undertaking with regard to his claim to the site and that what they require is merely a limited undertaking that in the event of H.M.G. or the Government of India purchasing the site he will not raise as against them a claim for damages or for the ownership of the property. This would not , however, preclude the Sheikh from suing the vendor for damages and the Sheikh’s undertaking to H.M.G. and the Government of India would be kept confidential. The Government of India are not really directly interested in this aspect of the question, since Ahwaz is now a purely Foreign Office post,and they will not be called upon to share the cost of building the new Consulate. The Foreign Office draft despatch seems on the whole satisfactory from our point of view, and it is submitted that we may concur in it without consulting the Government of India. It might indeed be argued that the Foreign Office draft errs on the side of insisting too rigidly on the Sheikh waiving any possible claim against H.M.G. in respect of the site, in view of the unlikelihood that he will ever be in a position under Persian law to raise any such claim. On the other hand we aie hardly in a position to suggest this to the Foreign Office and probably could not do so without consulting the Government of India. We might, however, make the minor suggestion mentioned in the draft letter to the Foreign Office in view of the admitted moral obligation resting on H.M.G. to compensate the Sheikh. The Foreign Office are anxious if possible to dispose of this question before the end of March during j t s tf* FP. the/ iP.Z.1466/35.

You will see that the Sheikh has boggled at signing an undertaking to waive all claims in connexion with the •’Sheikh of Mohammerah’s site”. His reluctance, however, seems to be due only to his entertaining some shadowy hope of being able to establish his title to the site itself. This point, of course, concerns us closely because as you know we are doing our best to buy the site for a Consulate. We do not think, however, that it will concern the Government of India, since we do not share capital expenditure at Ahwaz with them.

Janii, ry 11th, 19*&gt;6 3ir, I have the nonour to inform you that, on receipt of telegram lio.42T of December 2Jdna last from the Government of Inain, authorising me to maxe an e x gratia payment of 50,000. fifty thousand Kupces to the Sheixh of Mohamon rah, I inetructea tne Oriontal Secretary to His Muji sty's legation to call on the Sneihh &lt;-na tnc t uire how he would lihe this payment to be effected. 2. 14r. Tro11 explained that I haa been authorised to pay him this sum on condition that he sh uld waive all claims in respect of the Ahwaz eit®, the foundations of the buildings and the building materials. To this the Shclfch replied that, while he would give a receipt in full settlement of his advances and of any interest which he had in the building, he could not waive his claim to the actual site, which he still regarded as his property. Mr.Trott reminded him that as long ago as 19«3&amp; he had admitted that he had discovered that his title to the sit© was not valid, but the Siieixh remained firm and maintained, with a wealth of reasons with which I \ feel it riardly necessary to weary you, that the land belonged\ w v to him by virtue of a firman dealing with the xarun lands. The lir.aan covered not merely the site in question but also number of other properties and if he were to sign a document \ \ of the nature which we desired , it would prejudice his V- rights The rtight Honourable fir John Simon, G.G.S.I., etc., etc. . etc. ■Mm■ 3H to all the lanae mentioned in the finnun* fie iv mid only waive hie claim 'if fiie kajeety* e Minieter directs me ''todoeo. X will do anything he lihes, for I have always 'trusted the British and hnow that they vill not let iae down 1 * Mr.Trott then said that he had heard that the heirs of Haji Main ut Tujj&amp;r Bushiri were going to file? an application for the registration of the site as their property and enquired whether the aheiKh proposed to enter a caveat. The Sheifch replifcid that such action on his part would be useless; while on the other hand he did not trust the heirs of Hajl Muin an inch and it would he quite hopeless to try and reach any frienely settlement with them. In conclusion he expressed hie gratitude lor what we haa done and were doing. He had Rs.50,000. never hau any anxiety hout the fifty thousand tepees which he iuaew would oc paid back in due ti^ie. He only trusted that I would not tninx that he was trying to make difficulties; in any case he would always abide by my decision. d. On studying again the terms of the letter from the India Office enclosed in your despatch Ho*416(k fitil&amp;/56/£34) I am not convinced that it is intended that the ex gratia payment should only be made to the Sheikh on condition that he abandons his claim that the site on which the Consulate foundations lie, belongs to him rather than to the heirs of Haji Muin. Is it of i portanoe to His Maj sty’s Government that he should make such a renunciation'!: Our primary desire is that it should be decided by the Persian Government who is the owner of the land, so that v.e may proceed with building operations. The money advanced by the Bheikh was for preliminary work on the building and would it not be sufficientsufficient if he ucuaitted that he had no further claim upon Eis Majesty* b Oov« rnunent in respect of the site, the foundations unci the building materials? It is essential to insist that he should Vvaive all claims against a third party? I assume f however that if this view is adopter, it would not he possible for me to mafce payment to the 3he-iJth until after registration of the land had been effected in the name of H&amp;ji Muin* s heirs, as there would be an element of risJc in placing absolute reliance on his assurance that he would not oppose any application on their part* 4* If on the othor hand I am only authorised to make payment to the Snei&amp;h on the condition that he abandons all claims in respect of the site, the foundations and the building materials, the only course which I can suggest is that Mr.Trott should call once more on the Sheikh and explain that, while there is no desire on my part to coerce him, I feel that it 88*50,000 ♦ W0U 2 £ j. n oe k i8 own interest to accept the fifty thousand Hupees on the terms which I am authorised to offer* He would lose nothing by this course if he has no intention of opposing the registration of the site in the names of Haji Main* s heirs. 5* 2here is perhaps a hope, though not a very substantial one, that in the interval the Sheikh may have reconsidered his attitude* 6. I should be glad to receive in due course your further ins cruet ions in the matter. I would further venture to suggest that it would be of assistance if I could be furnished with a draft form of release for the Sheikh^ signature which satisfies the minimum requirements of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India* 7.

(3) We also raised with the Foreign Office the question whether it might not be preferable to pay an annuity to the sheikh in place of a single payment. (India Office to Foreign Office, 27th July, P.Z.4512/34). 2. As regards the first of these points, no official reply has been received from the Foreign Office. But it may, I think, safely be assumed that they accept our various conditions, since they have taken up with us uemi-officially (see correspondence with sir Frederick Butler on the file below) the question of the method by which payment is to be made, and we have agreed, on their suggestion, that the Government/should, if necessary, put the Minister at Tehran in funosfhn tne understanding that a moiety of the amount disbursed will immediately be recoverable from the Foreign Office. to in paragraph 1 above, the Minister at Tehran has expressed 'a very decided view that a lump sum payment to the sheikh of kohanmerah through his bank at Baghdad would be preferable to an annuity 1 * (Tehran despatch 352 of 26th July, on P.Z.5472/34); and in his further despatch of 7th September he has suggested that if the lump sum is paid into an account of the Sheikh's outside Persia there would be little risk of the Persian Government being able to confiscate it, while the Minister would keep the transaction entirely as between the Legation ana the sheikh.

I am therefore writing to ask whether you think the Government of India would agree to the Minister at Tehran making the entire payment of Rs.50,000 to the Sheikh from Indian funds at the post, one-half to he recovered subsequently hy you from us, 4. It is true that we took the initiative in asking India to share the expenditure with us, hut on the other hand the liability now admitted, though ex gratia , arises from an undertaking originated hy India at the time when Ahwaz was an Indian post. Moreover, all previous expenditure in respect of the abortive building scheme was dealt with hy India in the first place, our share having been recovered in the usual manner. 5. For these reasons we think that India may he willing to make the entire payment to the Sheikh inthe first place. I hope very much that this will be possible, as otherwise we may meet with considerable difficulties in trying to provide our half-share in some other way. A special subhead or item of the Vote would be liable to attract attention and excite discussion; and, though we cannot expect India to worry much on that ground, I am sure that you will share our view that public discussion, either here or in India, should be avoided if possible.(&gt; /' ^ NO. 4X3.

Please see the orinati-^n at P.Z. 1878/34. 2. The Government of India have now agreed to accept a moiety of the cost of repaying the Sheikhs Rs. 50,000, on the understanding mentioned in our letter to India, that the payment from Indian revenues is made without prejudice to our view that the Government of India are under no financial liability in respect of the pledges given by H.M.G. to the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit in 1914, and subject also to the condition that the Sheikh waives all further claims on the Ahwaz site. The latter condition, as will be seen from the correspondence at P.Z. 4417/34, has also been made by the Treasury (who have now also agreed to pay a moiety of the Rs. 50,000) in respect of the payment to be made from Imperial revenues, and it is of course in the interests of H.M.G. rather than of the Govt, of India that the Sheikh should waive all further claims to the site, since the former intend to make use of the site for new consular buildings if the heirs of the Moin-ut-Tajjar are able to secure a clear title to the property. It will be remembered that the Government of India have no further interest in the Ahwaz site, since Ahwaz is nowpurely (? Foreign Office post. When the Sheikh has waived all claim to the site to the foundations and building materials, the latter can be divided in equal moieties between the Government of India and H.M.G. only. This seems the simplest arrangement. 3, With regard to the foundations of the 1924 buildings, it appears that a part of these foundations are standing full across an area which has now been appropriated/ 1712b 5P00 3.33appropriated by the local Municipal Authorities for a public road, and^in order to avoid possible complications with these Authorities the Foreign Office (without j consulting this Department) informed His Majesty's Minister at Teheran in January this year that H.M.G. had no interest in these foundations and authorised Sir j Reginald Hon£e to inform the Persian Authorities in this sense if he thought fit. When the Rs. 50,000 has been refunded to the Sheikh, the ownership of these foundations will presumably revert to H.M.G.and the Govt, of India (or possibly to the heirs of the Moin.). It is probably unlikely that the Local Authorities could raise a claim against H.M.G. or the Government of India for the cost of removing that part of the foundations which are obstructing the public road, but it will be as well to I ask the Foreign Office for confirmation on this point. / L.. The Government of India have asked for an assurance that there will be no danger of the money paid to the Sheikh being intercepted or confiscated (since the Sheikh is at present more or less a prisoner at Teheran). The risk of this has already occurred to the Treasury and the Foreign Office, and the Foreign Office are already consulting the Minister at Teheran on the suggestion that it might be preferable to pay an annuity to the Sheikh instead of a single payment, but there are certain difficulties in this alternative proposal. We might suggest to the Foreign Office the possibility of the Legation at Teheran taking charge of the Rs. 50,000 on behalf of the Sheikh and disbursing it to him in instalments as a means of minimising the danger of the' money being confiscated by the Persian Authorities.

Our letter suggests that in return the sheikh should give us a release from any claims of his on the consular site.

Dear r&gt;kevin f ton, In reply to your letter, K. 11886 / 2 , of the 11th instant, about Ahvaz, the case is a political one and we are not concerned with refunding the 50,000 rupees to the sheikh. If you are going to authorise this payment, however, we might as well take advantage of it to get a release from the sheikh in respect of any outstanding claims of his, of whatsoever nature, on this site. It is true that the Teheran Legation in their despatch No.58, dated 10th February, 1933, report that the Moin established his title to the site but as he declined to pay anything to the Sheikh by way of compensation the sheikh or hici heir ? might presumably be able to revive some sort of claim at a later date. In our papers there is a copy of a letter from Monyoenny, to the Minister, No.13, dated 7th March, 1932, which says 'At the same time both Amir Humayun and Muhandisul- Mamalik, the Sheikh’s agent, are aware of the letter, dated the 9th vilhi^ah 1323, given by the Moin to the sheikh of Mohammerah accenting the sheikh as equal partner and agent in any arrangement that might be made for the construction of a Consulate F. skevington, Esq. , M.B.K., Treasury Chambers, 'I ♦ • • &gt;.W. 1'I am informed that Amir Humayun hau written to the Moin proooaing to him that he should offer to pay Sheikh Kha-al an amount equal to the expenditure he incurred on the foundations of the new Consulate on condition that he abandons any further claim to the consulate site. * The Amir Humayun of course, ie the Moin'e son. The letter seems to show that at one time the pheikh had some sort of claim on the Moin. It is all very nebulous, of course, but as there should be no difficulty in getting the sheikh to waive any claim in return for the money, the Foreign Office might as well get this release* If the whole 60,000 rupees are paid over to the Sheikh he will, of course, h^ve becrn reimbursed all his expenditure on this site and in this event the 6,000 odd rupees which the India Office got by the sale of unused materials on the site should be divided up between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. Lastly - though this is not my business - I suppose th t we can ensure the Sheikh’s actually getting the money. If he is a sick and aged man, virtually s prisoner, there may be some doubt about it and I should have thought it safer to pay him an annuity. Yours sincerely, (Signed) W.

The case for doing anything that we can to help the Sheikh of Mohammerah in his present misfortunes, brought on him by adherence to our cause, is morally a very strong one. The Persian Govt., repudiating an agreement they made with him in 1931, have now confiscated all his property m Persia, and he is in very straitened circumstances. H.L.G. are really under more than a moral obligation, as they have completely failed to keep the pledges given him in 1914 (quoted on the third page of the F.O. official letter). The G. of I. do not share the responsibility for this failure. Nevertheless, the moral aspect of the case is of interest to the G. of I. as well as to H.M.G. Moreover, the G. of I. themselves were primarily concerned m the particular transaction m respect of which it is now suggested that the Sheikh should receive an eg gratla payment. The history of that transaction is somewhat complicated, and there are voluminous papers on the subject. Briefly, in 1924 the G. of I. entered into a most peculiar agreement with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, under which the latter was to lease some land for Consulate buildings at Ahwaz, .and also to advance Rs.2i/Minute Paper. Department. Rs.2£ lakhs to the G. of I., who, on their side, were to erect the buildings and pay a rent calculated at 8% of the Sheikh’s advances for 30 years. As was noted on our papers at the time, this v/as a strange and somewhat humiliating arrangement, as the G. of I. (with whom, of course, h.M.G. were 50% associated), having failed to provide decent accommodation for our Consul by other means, took advantage of the willingness of a local notable to advance them the money wherewith to build a consulate. 7/hen, in 1925, the Sheikh was carried off as a virtual prisoner to Tehran, the agreement of course lapsed, and legally we owe the Sheikh nothing. But, on the other hand, it is a disagreeable fact that by that time the Sheikh had already advanced Rs.50,000, and that he has not received, and never can receive, any rent. The arrangement v/as not of the Sheikh’s seeking, and it would not be unnatural if he took the view that in effect he has lent the G. of I. Rs.50,000 which has not been repaid. I cannot help feeling that if the facts regarding this affair became widely known, the G. oi 1* would cut a sorry figure. On these grounds there seems to be a case for the G. of I. contributing half an gr a tia payment of Rs.50,000 (less any small sum that would be repaid to the Sheikh from the proceeds of the building materials left at site, or anything that he may receive in respect of the value of the foundations). The circumstances are so special that, if the G. of I. agreed to this, I do not think that there is any serious risk of the case prejudicing our general position that we acknowledge no financial responsibility in respect of the failure of h.l.g./ 12621 6000 3/34Minute Paper.

Department ^ nJi 13 APR 1934 Sir, I am directed by the S. of S. for I. in C. to transmit copy of a letter from the F.O. , with enclosures, regarding the request of the Sheikh of Mohammerah for compensation for the loss of Rs.50,000 sustained in connection with the abortive agreement which he made with the G. of 1. in 1924 for the construction of a consular building at Ahwaz. It will be seen that Sir John Simon strongly urges that this sum should be refunded to the Sheikh as an ex -Tatia payment from Imperial and Indian revenues in equal shares. 'i, It will be remembered that m 1924 the G. of I. entered into an agreement with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, under c • * which the latter was to lease some land for consulate buildings at nhwaz, and also to advance Rs.2-£- lakhs to the G. of I.,. who on their side were to erect the buildings and pay a rent calculated at 8k&gt; of the Sheikh’s advances for 30 years. The Sheikh had already advanced Rs.50,000 when, in 1925, owing to circumstances over which he had no control, he beca.e unable to implement further the terms of the agreement. While it is doubtless true that the agreement was a comneicial transaction/transaction in respect of which the Sheikh has no claim on the G. of I. on strictly legal grounds, the S. of S, feels that there is a strong case for the proposed ex pratia payment, in view of the peculiar circumstances m which the agreement was made and the somewhat anomalous nature of the agreement itself. It was the G. of I. who originally suggested an agreement on these lines, and * »/* hi*! the Sheikh 7 enter^ into it an orctor to /v / oblige the G. of I. and H.L.G., who were unable at the time, owing to acute financial stringency, themselves to undertake the expenditure required to provide suitable consulate buildings at Ahwaz. By his willingness to meet the G. of I. in this manner, the Sheikh in effect became their creditor to the extent of Rs.50,000 J before , owing to force majeure . he became unable to carry out the remainder of his contract.

Under-Secretary of State The facts regarding the loss of Rs.50,000 by the Sheikh of Moharamerah in connection with his agreement with the dovernment of India for the construction of their Consulate at Ahwaz are as follows. In view of the increasing necessity for providing a suitable habitation for His Majesty f s Consul at Ahwaz, the proposal to build a Consulate there which had been first mooted in 1904 was revived after the War, and the Sheikh of Moharamerah offered to sell the desired site for a Consulate to the Grovernment of India for Rs.75,000• The Covernment of India in 1921 refused this offer owing to acute financial stringency but enquired whether the Sheikh would be willing to build a house at his own expense and rent it to Government for a Consulate. The Sheikh agreed to do this and in 1924 an Agreement was finally entered into between the Sheikh and the Government of India under which the Sheikh was to finance the erection of the buildings at a cost not exceeding 2i lakhs of rupees, the buildings to remain the property of the Sheikh and the Governmentof India to rent them for 30 years at an annual rental of Q/o of the capital advanced by the Sheikh (about F.s.20,000 per annum). The Treasury agreed to accept a moiety of the annual rental as a charge on Imperial revenues. Building operations were accordingly begun and in 1925 p4S.50,000 hau already been advanced by the Sheikh and an additional -‘S.l£&gt;000 expended by the G-overnment of India on materials] in anticipation of a further advance^ *#en the Sheikh was captured by the Persian Government and carried off under arrest to Tehran where he still remains,, ^/e was thus prevented by force majeure from carrying out the terms of his contract with the Government of India -and thoy- ordered that building operations should be abandoned. The Foreign Office argue convincingly both in their official letter of 17th March and in Sir Lancelot Oliphant's d.o. letter to Sir Louis Kershaw that if H.M.O. had been able to carry out the assurance given to the Sheikh on their behalf in the Political Resident’s letter of November, 1914, that they would 'afford him the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory/r\ satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on his jurisdiction and recognised rights or on his n property in Persia, the bheikh would have been able to carry out the terms of his building contract with the Government of India and that the abandonment of the building scheme and the consequent forfeiture by the Sheikh of his capital outlay were the direct outcome of H,M.G. f s failure to fulfil their written promise. Indeed the case for payment of compensation to the Sheikh by H.M.G. on these grounds and for refunding his Rs.50,000 is extremely strong, but it can hardly be expected to carry much weight with the Government of India in view of the fact that the Government of India and the Secretary of State have consistently maintained that they can accept no financial liability arising out of failure to implement the assurances made on behalf of H.M.G. in 1914 to the Sheikh of Mohammerah as also to the Sheikh of Koweit in order to obtain their support r -J' during the War. We regard any ility for expenditure/*■ ito *+(*** ^ ^ . m . **+1***’ UU* ^ ^ ] .„. -j- it- /&gt;^i' /«. tti± 7&gt;*&amp; ( f^&gt;^&gt; ^ /v &lt;*n o^ccer^. L expenditure d# this Bat&amp;*€ sbfeiaifl^- ^ut ■ isifrHho Way as having been discharged by the contribution of A £100 million^ made by India to the cost of the War. It will be remembered that an assurance was given to both Sheikhs that their Date hardens in Iraq would remain in their possession and be immune from taxation but that the Iraqi Government have imposed taxation on the Sheikhs’ Date Gardens and H.M.G. have hitherto failed to compensate the Sheikhs or to •A/ persuade the Iraqi Government to remove/taxation. As recently as June last in writing to the foreign Office on the question of compensating the Sheikhs for the taxation o^r their Jate Gardens we stated that n as regards the question of incidence, Sir Samuel Hoare has already made it clear that he cannot accept any liability on behalf of Indian revenues in respect of any compensation which may be paid either to the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sheikh of Mohammerah in composition for the assurances given to those Rulers on behalf of H.M.G. in 1914* (P.Z.2942/33).(£ 3 ) In view of the above it would be difficult to agree now to accept a moiety of the cost of refunding the Sheikh’s Es.50,000 on the grounds advanced in the Foreign Office official letter, viz_. failure to implement the 1914 assurances^without serious prejudice to the attitude which we have adopted on the question of the Date (hardens and which for financial reasons it is important for us to maintain. On the other hand, apart altogether from the responsibility of H.M.G. for implementing the 1914 assurances there is in the circumstances of this particular case a good deal to be said for paying compensation from Indian revenues on other grounds. The Agreement between the Government of India and the Sheikh under which the Sheikh advanced the Rs.50,000 was entered into by the latter partly no doubt as a commercial proposition^but also in order to help the Government of India out of a difficulty when they were unable themselves to undertake the cost of building a Consulate. The Government of India were indeed dependent at that time on the generosity of the Sheikh for the provision of/of a suitable residence for their Consul at Ahwaz and now that the Sheikh is himself in financial difficulties owing to the persecutions of the Persian Government, it Aft^s^^air that the j-overnment of India should share with the Poreign Office the cost of any compensation that may be paid to him. On wider grounds as Sir Lancelot Oliphant says in his letter, the Government of India as much as H.M.G. have a moral responsibility to do what little they can towards easing the lot of their former proteg£. On receiving Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch of 14th January, 1933, (the first enclosure to the Foreign Office letter) the Government of India wrote demi-officially (P.Z. 2166/33 copy attached) saying that they could not accept the Minister’s suggestion that the money advanced by the Sheikh should be treated as a loan repayable to him and that they were not prepared to go beyond the proposals which they had made for sharing with the Sheikh the proceeds of the sale of the unused materials which were left over ^when building operations came to an end. These materials/&lt;4 ({tST&gt; etrv (S' cAlCy-Ud materials have now been disposed of for the paltry sum of Bs.6,000 and under the Government of India f s proposals the Sheikh's share of the proceeds will * *t/u not amount to as much as Bs.4,000. It is suggested, iz.-tb ~ therefore, that on the grounds mentioned above there ^ceef-c^Jt u^e(.y 7 C*ru&gt;i J&lt; $&lt; a cage for as ^^ n g the Government of India whether they would be prepared to reconsider their decision and make a purely e x-gratia payment to the Sheikh without prejudice to our views as to HJLG.'s liability for implementing the 1914 assurances.

My dear Laithwaite, Please refer to Tehran Legation Despatch Ho,14, dated the 14th January 1933, (copy enclosed) on the question of the abandoned Ahwaz Consulate buildings project. You will have observed from our letter Ho. F.360-A/31 dated the 21st June 1932, that the Government of India have suggested that the sale proceeds of the materials at site should be divided between the Sheikh and the Government of India in the proportion of the expenditure incurred by them respectively. This suggestion was made because the Government of India recognized that the Sheikh had been prevented from performing his part of the contract by T force majeure T , and did not therefore deserve to be penalized for breach of contract. But they cannot accept Hoare's suggestion that the money advanced by the Sheikh to the Public Works Department for commencing the works on his behalf should be treated as a loan repayable to him, and they are not prepared to go beyond the proposals made in their letter of the 21st June 1932. lours sincerely, (Sd.) H.A.F.Metcalfe. J.G.Laithwaite,Esquire, India Off ice, .Whitehall, London, S.W.l. (Wich 2 s.cs. of letter only)17th March, 1934 Foreign Office, S.W.l. Dear Kershaw, ‘ ^ in our official letter No.K 7891/108/234 of to-day's date, we urged that an ex gratia payment should he made to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in compensation for certain losses connected with the agreement which he made with the Government of India in 1924 for the construction of a consular building at Ahwaz. 2. This is a matter about which we feel strongly, and I should be most grateful if you could find time to have a look at the corresnondence. The case deserves examination not only as an isolated issue, but also in the light of wider general considerations, 3. Even considering the question solely on its own merits, there seems to us to be a very good case for compensating the sheikh. The essence of the whole matter is that the abandonment of the building scheme, and the consequent Sir Louis Kershaw, K.C.S.I., G.I.E.the • • • &lt; 5 D consequent 1’orf’eiture by the sheikh of* his capital outlay, were the direct outcome of our failure to fulfil our written promises and protect him against the Persians* If we had been able to fulfil these promises, the sheikh would have continued to be a power in Khuzistan, the building which he planned would be in use by us to-day, and the Sheikh would have suffered no loss on the transaction. It was, no doubt, an ordinary commercial transaction, and the Sheikh concluded the agreement to benefit himself rather than His Majesty’s Government. But the fact remains that he would never have taken the financial risk which the agreement entailed for him if he had foreseen how little our written promises were going to help him in his struggle with the pahlevi regime . 4. Quite apart, however, from the consideration, in strict equity, of the particular aspect of the Sheikh’s affairs, there is the wider question of the moral reponsibility of His Majesty’s Government to do what little they can towards easing the lot of their former protege . And in this matter of moral responsibilitythe • • • the Government of India, as you and they will readily agree, are at least as closely concerned as His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The Sheikh, it must be remembered, is no longer the rich man that he once was; the last Tehran despatches, of which copies were enclosed in our official letter, E 1132/1123/34 of the 16th instant show, indeed, that he is in very low water financially, and that the suggested ex gratia payment would make a great difference to his comfort. The Persians have evidently no intention of settling his affairs even in the extremely inequitable manner which Teymourtache at one time contemplated. They are merely waiting for him to die. The Sheikh himself nov/ realises that, as regards the general settlement of his affairs, attempts on our part to intervene on his behalf would be useless, and might even be positively harmful to his interests. There is, therefore, nothing that we can now do to help him save by way of the direct payment which we have proposed, I very much hope that with your knowledge of what I may call the 'moral background' of this most unfortunate affair.i CUD the India Office will he willing to urge on the Government of India both officially and semi-officially the acceptance of our proposals.INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. K 7891/108/234. and address— not ^fo any person by name. but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. Sir, Foreign Office. S.W.l. 17th March 1934. With reference to India Office letter PZ 2166/33 of April 19th, 1933, I am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit herewitu, to he laid before the Secretary of State for India, copies of despatches No. 14 of January 14th, and No* 52 of February 10th 1933, from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and despatch No. 285 of June 15th, 1933, from His Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires, regarding the request of the Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah for compensation for the loss of 50,000 rupees sustained in connexion with the abortive agreement vihich he made with the G-overnment of India in 1924 for the construction of a consular building at Ahwaz. 2. It has already been decided that a share of the proceeds of the sale of certain unused building materials which formerly lay on the ’’sheikh of Mohammerah’s site” shall be paid to the Sheikh, but it will not be possible to ascertain how much he will receive on this account until the amount of the net proceeds of the sale is known and until the method of dividing the proceeds between the Sheikh on the one hand and the Government of India and His Majesty’s Treasury on the other has been decided. In connexion with these two points, I am to enquire whether there has been any further correspondence since India Office letter PZ 8127/33 of December 20th, 1933 and V The Under Secretary of State, India Office. PZ 4027/32//-S PZ 4027/32 of July 20th, 1932, respectively. In any case, it is clear that the Sheikh will not receive as much as 5,000 rupees for the materials. 3* The foundations of the 'buildings on the u Sheikh of Mohammerah’s site” probably remain the property cf the Sheikh, hut these foundations have no doubt deteriorated considerably and in any case are probably not saleable for more than a trifling sum. This factor in the situation appears, indeed, to be almost negligible, but His Majesty's Minister at Tehran is nevertheless being requested to report on it. 4. The balance of the sum of 50,000 rupees must represent a sheer loss for the Sheikh unless His Majesty's Government compensate him by an ex gratia payment, sir John Simon is aware that the Government of India have hitherto been unwilling to agree that any such payment should be made. After very careful consideration, however, he feels strongly that, having regard to the Sheikh's connexion with British interests in Persia and the Persian Gulf, the moral obligations which His Majesty's Government have incurred towards him, the nature of the events which led to the Sheikh's ruin and consequent breach of his contract with the Government of India, and the nature of the contract itself, it is incumbent on His Majesty's Government and the Government of India to indemnify Sheikh Khazal for ary loss which he has suffered as a result of his agreement with the Government of India. In support of this view, I am to quote the following letter which the Political P.esident in the Persian Gulf addressed to the Sheikh of Mohammerah on/on November 21st, 1914;- 'With reference to tbe assurances conveyed to ’’your Excellency in my letter No# 307, dated the 15th ’’October, 1910 (11th Shawwal, 1328), and having regard ”to the further valued services and co-operation which ’’Your Excellency has rendered to the British Government ” and to British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el- ”Arab, I am now authorised to assure Your Excellency ’’ personally, and to do so by this writing that, wnatever ’’ change may take place in the form of the Government of ’’ Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His ' Majesty^ Government will be prepared to afford you the ’’ support necessary for obtaining a solution satisfactory ’’ both to yourself and to us in the event of any encroachment * * ” by the Persian Government on your .jurisdiction and ’’recognised rights or on your property in Persia. In like ’’manner, they will safeguard you to the best of their ability ’’against any unprovoked attack by a foreign power or against *1any encroachment by such pov/er on your jurisdiction and ’Recognised rights or on your property in Persia. ’Rhese assurances are given for yourself and for your ’’successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold ’’good so long as you and they do not fail to observe ”your and their obligations towards the Persian Government, ’’provided that the nomination of your successors from ’’among your male descendants snail be subject to confidential ’’consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty's 'Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to 'be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government and to 'maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Vis-h-vis/M Vis-^-vis the Persian Government, we shall do 'our hest to maintain Your Excellency in your present 'state of local autonomy. 'Further the date gardens which you now possess on 'the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arat) shall remain in ’T'ull possession of you and your heirs and immune from 'taxation'. 5. These very precise promises made hy the Political Resident to the Sheikh have not been fulfilled, and it cannot he said that their non-fulfilment was due to any failure on the part of the Sheikh on his side to satisfy the conditions on which they rested. By 1925 important changes had indeed taken place 'in the form of the Government 'of Persia,' and His Majesty’s Government were unable, largely as a result of the attitude of the present Shah, to afford the Sheikh the support which they had definitely promised him. Sheikh Khazal was carried off by force to Tehran, where he still remains under domiciliary arrest. His lands were confiscated; his 'jurisdiction' and rights were swept away; and no solution satisfactory either to him or to His Majesty’s Government has been reached. The Sheikh’s present plight and his continued devotion to His Majesty’s Government are described in Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatches Nos. 26 of the 17th January and 45 of the 3lst January, copies of which were sent to the India Office in Foreign Office letter No. E 1152/1123/34 of the 16th instant. 6. In explanation of the failure of His Majesty’s Government to carry out their written promises to the Sheikh, it can, of course, be said that it was beyond their power to do/8/ do so, and indeed tHat it would, in the nature of things, be impossible to execute such promises in the territory of a foreign and friendly state* The promises nevertheless were given, and, so far as the Sheikh’s rights under the Ahwaz building scheme are concerned, it cannot be maintained that His Majesty’s Government are unable to protect him from loss. The scheme would not have been abandoned, and the Sheikh’s rights under it, and profit from it would not have been forfeited, if His Majesty’s Government had been able to afford him the wider protection which they had guaranteed. In Sir John Simon* s opinion their inability to do this renders it essential that His Majesty’s Government should now make such restitution to the Sheikh as lies in their power. 7. In these circumstances, Sir John Simon feels bound to urge that the sum of 50,000 rupees should be refunded to the Sheikh of Mohammerah as an ex gratia payment from Imperial and Indian revenues in equal snares; and I am to express the earnest hope that the Secretary of State for India will be ready to press the Government of India to accept a moiety of this charge, less one half of any sums which may possibly be recovered by the Sheikh in the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this letter. In view of the Sheikh’s failing health and of the serious financial straits in which he now finds himself, I am also to suggest that it is very desirable that payment should forthwith be made to him^on account, of the sum of 20,000 rupees in equal snares from British and Indian funds.8. A copy of this letter is 'being sent to His Majesty’s Treasury with a request for their approval of the arrangements proposed so far as Britisn funds are concerned, and a copy is also 'being sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,Copy (K 1514/108/234) No.14. f 1 o o f Britisn Legation, Tenran. \ i 87 [ 19 3.^ | 14 th January, 1933&lt; Sir, I have the honour to report that in the course of a conversation with the Oriental Secretary a few days ago the Sheikh of Mohammerah mentioned, somewhat Rs» 50,000 . wistfully, the sum of fifty or sixty thousand Rupees that Rs.60 &gt;000 he had advanced for the 'building of His Majesty's Consulate at Ahwaz, and without formulating any definite request implied that he hoped he might recover this sum one day. This is the first time that the Sheikh has spontaneously raised the point, although he once mentioned the money he had spent in reply to a question by Sir R. Clive: it may 'be that he has hitherto thought it possible that the original arrangement might be revived provided nis own financial situation improved. Now that he knows His Majesty's Government are negotiating to purchase the 'Sheikh's site' outright from Haji Muin, he has probably concluded that io is not. I believe that the amount Rs.50,000 advanced is actually fifty thousand Rupees only. 2. The fact that the Sheikh has recently acknowledged the right of Haji Muin to the Ownership of the site, without receiving any compensation for doing so (see my despatch No. 230 of 13th May, 1932) does not affect, in any essential respect, the position of either the Sheikh or the Haji in regard to the building transaction. The land has always belonged to the Haji, but as long ago as 1905 he gave the Sheikh a document in wnich he agreed that if the latter were to build a house /upon The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G. C. S. I., etc. , e l&gt;c» , etc. , The Foreign Office.upon that land and lease the house to His Majesty’s Government, he (the Haji) would place the site at his disposal in return for half the rent derived from the house. He also agreed that the Sheikh should conduct all the negotiations with His Majesty’s Government^ This, according to Haji Muin, is still his position: in other words, he is willing to go aiiead with the transaction whenever the Sheikh wishes to do so. The Sheikh, however, is very hard up at present and even if he could advance the money I am of the opinion that His Majesty’s Government should avoid continuing this rather unsatisfactory arrangement, and buy or rent outright whatever land or buildings may be required. 3. As a result of the Sheikh’s remark, I have gone carefully into the question of the position as between him and His Majesty’s Government in respect of his advance Rs.50 1 000 . of Rupees fifty thousand; this has, I cannot help feeling, been somewhat obscured by his relations with the Persian Government and the Muin. The facts are simple enough. After the war His Majesty’s Government, or rather the Government of India, revived a project of many years standing to acquire a Consulate at Ahwaz, but were unable to find the money for the purchase of a site and the construction of a house. They therefore asked the Sheikh whether he would build them a house or houses upon a certain piece of land, undertaking, if he did so, to lease the houses from him at a stated rent for a term of years. The Sheikh consented and a detailed agreement was drawn up. The houses were to be built at a cost not exceeding two and Rs.2,50,000 .a half lakhs of rupees, and the Government of India would rent them for thirty years at a rent equalling eight per /centcent on the outlay. At this stage a minor complication arose, as the Government of India wished the houses to he constructed according to their own ideas; it was therefore arranged that the Government of India should undertake the actual building and the Sheikh merely make advances from time to time. He had made advances totalling fifty thousand rupees and the Government of India had spent this and some thirteen thousand rupees besides, when circumstances prevented the Sheikh from advancing any more money. These circumstances were of such a kind as to merit the description force majeure. being in fact the kidnapping and removal of the Sheikh to Tehran on political grounds, and the virtual sequestration of his property in Khuzistan. At this time (early 1925) the foundations of two houses and a quantity of building material represented the sixty three thousand rupees that had been spent. Subsequently the municipality of Ahwaz evolved a town-planning scheme which required the surrender of a part of the site, including half of the foundations of the smaller of the houses, thereby rendering the money spent on its foundation practically a dead loss. Also the building materials were sold with a view to the division of the money so obtained between the Government of India and the Sheikh, in the proportions that each had spent on the construction. The sum so obtained did not exceed a few thousand rupees. 4. Now I presume that a strictly legal interpretation of these facts would be that the Sheikh had entered into a contract which events beyond his control had prevented his fulfilling; and that though the other party might not in the circumstances be justified in demanding compensation for breach of contract, they could /onon the other hand, not he held responsible for the reimhursement of any sums that he might have already expended with the object of carrying out that contract. 5. But this is not, I submit, a case in wuich a purely legal interpretation should prevail. In the first place, His Majesty T s Government, though not responsible for the events that made it impossible for the Sheikh to carry out his contract, were at any rate partially responsible for the fact that he was forced to submit to those events inasmuch as they were unable to afford him the degree of support which would have enabled him to resist; and though they have since done their best to regajn for him his liberty and his property, in compliance with a generally acknowledged moral obligation, there can be no doubt that they have failed to do so. 6. In the second place, the agreement for the construction of the Consulate was not of the Sheikh’s seeking: he entered into it, presumably, out of regard for the Government of India and in order to assist them to acquire a Consulate, which they could not otherwise do. I expect that his point of view is that he has lent the Government of India fifty thousand rupees and has not been repaid. The suggestion that the money wnicn he spent on the foundations was in the nature of a loan is fortified by the fact that this money was not expended direco, but paid over to the Government of India, and it is not weakened by the fact that repayment was to take place over a period of years. The Sheikh would also contend, I think, that it was not his fault that the money advanced was sunk by the recipient in what might prove to have been an unprofitable building venture. A.7. In reply to this iu might be objected that the venture was unprofitable only because the Sheikh’s title to the land became so suspect after his departure to Tehran that the Government of India were unable to proceed with the wo&gt;rk themselves, either by borrowing the necessary money elsewhere, or by constructing the houses at their own expense (repaying the Sheikh as a preliminary) and paying no rent except a ground-rent. The Sheikh would probably respond by pointing out that his title was only open to doubt because of political events beyond the control not only of himself, but of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. He might add that it was never conclusively proved that the Persian Government would not enter in an arrangement to recognise any lease granted by the Sheikh without prejudice to a subsequent decision as to whose the site might be. 8. The further complication of the claim of naji Muin is quite irrelevant. It may be that the Sheikh had really forgotten that the site belonged to the Haji, or that he remembered right enough and was merely using (and but for the events of 1925 would have gone on using) his local influence to purloin the site, or that when he called the land his, he meant his and his partner’s (the Haji). Whichever alternative is correct, iz does not affect the fact that, when convinced of the validity of the Haji's claim, the Sheikh offered to meet this claim by giving the Haji an equivalent site elsewhere and that the Haji, for his part,, was willing to continue the original arrangement, either with or without the Sheikh. This claim has, therefore, at no time formed an obstacle to the continued construction /ofof the two houses and the position today is that, so far as the Haji is concerned, the Sheikh may carry out the ^ original transaction with His Majesty’s Government. This he cannot do for financial reasons, hut he leaves it to His Majesty’s Government to make what arrangements they like with the Haji. 9. My conclusion is that, whatever the precise position in law or equity may he, the sum of fifty thousand Rs.50,000 rupees paid hy the Sheikh should he regarded as a loan and that its repayment must he regarded as a debt of honour. I therefore venture to express the earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India will undertake to repay this money, irrespective of what decision may he taken as to the future use of the Ahwaz site. In return the Sheikh should waive all further claims in respect of the land itself, the foundations of the two houses and the building materials. 10. I should add that this view was held hy my predecessor,and the recommendation made hy him in paragraph 15 of his despatch Ho. 392 of August 11th, 1930, is indistinguishable in essence from my own, the Haji having been substituted for the Persian Government. 11.

It appears that the Haji declined to accept the suggestion made by his son, Amir Humayun, that ne should reimburse the Sheikh and this suggestion does indeed seem to have been somewhat at variance with the true state of affairs between the Haji and the Sheikh, as explained in my despatch No. 14 of January 14th 1933. 3 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No. 10). I have, etc., (Signed) R.H. Howe. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc. , Foreign Office.Copy (E 3628/3618/34) No. 285 British Legation, Gulhek, 15th June, 1933. Sir, With reference to paragraphs 256 to 258 of the Annual Report on Persia for 1932, I have the honour to report that the Oriental Secretary recently visited the Sheikh of Mohammerah, on His Majesty* s Minister’s instructions, to discuss the matter of the rent of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah. 2. Mr. Trott found Sheikh Khazal in hed on the floor of his country house, looking old and feeble. Muhandis—ul—Mamalik, the Sheikh’s man of affairs, was present, and the talk naturally turned chiefly on the Sheikh’s attempt to get an arrangement with the Ministry of Finance. He has heard nothing from that Department for months, nor can he ever get a reply to his frequent messages. It is now nearly two years since the Sheikh, at the Ministry’s suggestion, signed a letter drafted by the Ministry agreeing to a valuation of his properties in the south with a view to their exchange for properties of a similar value in a different part of Persia. The Commission sent to Khuzistan to examine the land returned last spring to Tehran at the Ministry’s request, and since then no progress has been made. The Sheikh expressed himself to Mr. Trott as in despair: it was no good his petitioning the shah as His Majesty knew quite well about the delays. 3. Finding the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a most amiable mood when I called upon him last week, I mentioned/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I. etc., etc., etc.. t etc etcmentioned Sheikh Khazal’s affairs and asked him whether he could not speak a word to the Shah about them. His Highness said that he would rather speak to the Minister of Finance, though he was, he knew, overwhelmed with other work, poor* man. I urged Feroughi to do this and he said that he would, though I much doubt v/hether he will get any satisfaction out of Taghizadeh, even if he has the energy to speak to him. Mr. Trott had, as a matter of fact, already spoken a word to Taghizadeh on the subject at the King’s Birthday party and had not received any encouragement. His Excellency, in fact, treated the matter as of no importance whatever. Ignoring the delay in replying to the Sheikh’s petition, Taghizadeh said that the Sheikh had property outside Persia which provided for his immediate needs: that his affairs were in great confusion; and that the Ministry could not extract clear statements from the Sheikh. The last statement is completely at variance with the version of Muhandis-ul-Mamalik. Mr. Trott derived the clear impression that Taghizadeh had no intention whatever of lifting a finger on the sheikh’s behalf. 4. Feroughi asked me with a bland smile why His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom took such an interest in the Sheikh. I answered that surely His Highness must know the reason, which was a relic of the ’’bad old days” of the war, when the Sheikh had rendered great services to our forces fighting the Turks. His Majesty’s Government had a long memory for their friends and the Sheikh’s present misfortunes were on their conscience. I begged His Highness therefore to make an effort to get the Sheikh’s affairs regulated in order that one further obstacle might be removed from the way of the perfect/perfect relations which ought, as a result of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company agreement, now to exist between our countries. I knew that the Foreign Office took a lively interest still in this matter of the Sheikh: on the other hand the Persian Government could not now lay themselves open to an accusation of having yielded to British pressure if they afforded a measure of common justice to a poor and ailing man. Feroughi took all this very well, hut I shall he surprised if I have shaken his habitual lethargy. 5. A further subject mentioned by the Sheikh to the Oriental Secretary was that of the fifty thousand rupees which he had advanced for the building of a Consulate at Ahwaz and which formed the subject of Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 14 of January 14th last. The gist of the Sheikh’s remarks was ,T Whatever is decided about the land, the Government took my money: surely they will repay me?” I hope therefore that it may be possible for a decision to be reached in the sense recommended by Mr. Hoare. 5.

VS'P •v Sheikh of Mohammerah. I went to see the Sheikh yesterday evening. I found him in bed, or rather reclining on a mattress on the floor of a stfiall and undecorated room, with blankets over him, and propped up by a big pillow at his back. He had put on a Pahlevi hat. He was excessively nervous and fidgety, and continually moved about two little pillows in an endeavour to get comfortable. I asked him how his affairs were getting on with the Persian Government. He made a gesture of impotent rage and said he would rather not go into all that, nothing was going on. Taghi Eadeh had completely spoilt all the transactions which he had hoped to make. He had written the Sheikh a letter full of the most outrageous statements, saying that the previous settlement was a ’mistake’, etc., etc., ^uhandis ul Maaalik is still helping the Sheikh, but he is afraid to come near the Legation. The sheikh has recently appointed the well-known lawyer, Pasil ul Mulk, as his advocate, but he has little hope that any good will come of it. 'Don’t let us talk about that. I am finished. I don’t want to bore you with all the details. Ky money has gone, my property is gone, ay sons are gone. Only ay life la left. What does it matter? I promised Oox I would support the British Government as long as I lived. So I have and so I will. Long live the British Government; that is the only thing of any importance. I am old, I am ill# I am dying. I know nothing can be done.” When I asked for further details about the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, the sheikh said he would write ae a letter setting forth the present state of affairs. But he hinted that it would do no good for ua to do anything about it. Everybody was in a state of fear. Kobody dared to do anything. Anything we did would make it /worse.worse The only people who ever came to see him were the doctor, Logman ul Mulk, and Aslf-us-sultaneh, and of course Muhandie* We talked about current events. I told him that Mr. Havard was coming to Beyrout; he was pleased to hear the news. He talked a little about the taxation of his property in Iraq., hut seemed to he rather hazy about the details of the new tax - he did not recognise the word ’istihlak* - but he said tt You know I was told by Cox, as a definite promise, that my lands in Iraq would never be taxed; I rely on that promise*. The Sheikh asked after Sardar Safar and the Bakhtiaris generally, though he knew as much about them as I do. He said what bad luck it wes on old 2lafar^ who had very little money, to have all his son’s family battening on him. He also asked how Rashidi’s wife managed to live. On the whole I was surprised at the old man’s intelligence. He gave no signs whatever of softening of the brain. I understand that his glycosuria is better, though J, he has something the matter with his leg which keeps him in bed permanently. His son, Abdul Hamid Sardar A jail never comes near him. But his wife apparently lives in his house once more. In face he looked a bit better than when I last saw him. He enquired whether Sir P. Loraine was at Ankara yet. I conveyed H.M. Minister’s kind regards. (initialled) A.G.

It will be seen that Taqizadeh, when Minister of Finance, entirely repudiated the agreement drawn up in \August, 1951, for the exchange of the sheikh’s properties in Khuzistan for properties in other parts of the country, with the result that the Sheikh has now no source of income but his date-gardens in Iraq. 5. I fear that I can only agree with the Sheikh that intervention by the Legation would be of little use, and indeed make matters worse, unless that intervention were pressed to the utmost. But so long as Hie Majesty’s Government have any hopes of living on friendly terms with the Shah, such action is clearly out of the question, however ungratdUl to the Sheikh and wounding to our fine feelings it may be to say so. 4.

Sheikh of Mohaaaerah ; At the Sheikh*• requeot, I went to eee him again on Tuesday evening, the 16th instant. Muhandis ul Mamalik was there, and we talked for about an hour, discussing the present position of the Sheikh*s affairs. Muhandis told me that early last spring the Sheikh hacL petitioned the ^hah for permission to travel in Persia, for the benefit of Ms health, in any of the provisoes of Persia except Khusistan and (I think) ?ars. The •* -- - J the police of Tehran, Adife-us-Saltaneh, was forthwith sent to him in person and instructed him to go to the Court. Although the Sheikh was in bed he got into a car and wue; taken to the Shah, who spoke to him gruffly and in so many words told him to mind his own business. The sheikh did not complain of what the Shah said, but thought the manner of his being taken to the Court was a great iddignity. As regards the Sheikh*s financial affairs, in dune 1933 he addressed to the Minister of Finance, :i — jiadeh, a petition of which a translation is attached. A reply, of which a translation is also attached, came dated the 26th duly. It will be seen that the Minister of Finance evidently proposed, at that time, and m fact stated, that the agreement made in August 1931 fox- the exchange of his properties in Khusistan was &lt; o , waste paper. Muhandis was subsequently sent for# he was taken to see s subordinate in the Ministry of Finance who told him that the Gowernment' s terms were as follows; if tiJ. Shaikh did not lik. them he would get nothingi- The lands which the Sheikh held under firmans were not his property and would he confiscated hy the State. The /landslands which hs iiad bought and which had previously been crown lands (Khaliseh; were also the state’s and would be confiscated. All lands and properties which were at present being occupied by the troops or by any (rovennraent department woifcld be taken by the state without any compensation. Any other properties would be valued, and their price deducted from the Ministry of Finance’s unpaid claim for arrears of taxes of 400,000 Tomans (see the Annual Reports for 1924 and 1926). Muhandis said that this meant that the Sheikh had less than nothing left. He also asked that these proposals be put in writing. The man refused. The Sheikh was of course livici with rage at this further breach of faith. However, notices were put in the Khuzistan papers saying thct the Sheikh had no rights in respect of certain properties and that everyone who held titles from the Sheikh hah no title at all, etc., etc., The Sheikh then appointed Pazol**ul-*Mulk to be hie advocate, and laid claim to his lands in the Tribunal of the Ministry of Finance. The only tangible result of this so far2ms been that he has had to pay stamp fees in cash amounting to 15,000 Tomans. Soon after, two men appeared in his house, one from the Police and one from the Army. They insisted on seeing the Sheikh and said that his monthly subvention, paid to his son Abdullah who is in the Army, was two months in arrear. If he did not pay it on the spot, they would obtain it by other means. In vain the Sheikh pleaded that his rents had not yet been remitted from Ahwaz so that he had not the cash to pay; and that he would pay directly the cash arrived. They did not leave until he had paid the money; he managed to do so fro® another source. So the tragedy continues. The Sheikh, for his part, is evidently alive to the fact that our intervention /now3 now would be of little uae 9 unless it could be an interren- tlon which would be pursued to the utmost* The Sheikh in fast besought me hot to haye anything done if there was any chance of It making matters worse for him. The Sheikh realises that Kashidi, whom he knew well and once employed t has now been in prison for nearly a year and we have not got him out. The Sheikh was in bed and appeared to be permanently bed~ridden. His son, Abcail erim, is living in the same house. He never sees Sardar Ajail, his other son with whoa he used to be o» good terms. his wife, however, is with him again.

Dear Sir, Two years ago, when X was asked by the Ministry of Finance to make an agreement with regard to eraluation and exchange of my landed property at Khuzietan and settlement of the old discrepancies, I did not hesitate to sign the fair copy of the agreement which had been drafted in the Ministry of Finance without objecting at all to its contents, owing to the fact that this undertaking was during the tenure of office of Your Excellency, who is a man of justice and impartiality; although I had to suffer at the same time an amount of loss on it. I just did so to express my subordination and my wish to remove any misunderstandings. Certainly I expected and am expecting during Your Jccellency' s office to have all discrepancies adjusted and my situation cleared and determined with regard to the ease. This is in fact the reason for my having so many times troubled Your Excellency in writing or verbally through Dr. Hakia-ul-Mulk to enquire the reason for the aelay caused in the case. I regret that Your Excellency diet not favour me with any reply at all. Your Excellency will admit that letters from persons should have a reply either negative or positive, and I therefore expect to know the view of the Ministry of Finance regarding my affair. In case my landed properties are to be evaluated and exchanged in accordance with the ruling recently issued by the Government, I shall tnen be obliged to stop the means that I have provided during the last 18 months at Mohammersh and Ahwaz for advancing the work, such as eaploymen of some men, renting of houses, etc., etc., until these matters have been settled. In case a different view has been /adoptedadopted whereby I ehell hare to abolish the organizations and suffer a monthly loss on them, it would be a matter of great regret to me, as I was the first who stepped forward in accepting the Government's proposals to exchange my lands and am now the last to receive attention. Under His Imperial Majesty's abounding grass and care extended to all classes of people in this country, I have no doubt in finally receiving justice from His Imperial Majesty# In such circumstances# I should he very thankful if favoured with a reply hy Your ucceilency to relieve me from this undertermined state.
