In them you have touched on a number of subjects with most of wiich I can deal more conveniently in separate oonumi cations • X propose to confine this particular letter to the most important subject which you have di©cussed; viz, the rising of the Jharif Husain and his operations against the Turks in Hijaz* lou have written on this subject in your letters of the 18th Ramazan * 30th July, 15th oh&amp;wwal * 15th jfcguet and 4 th Dhi 1-qadah fK Heptembar • In the first letter you tm V*** *• of y° ur ^®^p.latlon a with ths Sharif, cnl told me eh&amp;t you feared his designs might be now, that ^ 14 to say you anticipated that he might have some intention of Interfering in Majd as h® had done before, fluid you ashed me to communicate your vieve and fears* to II. £ f s irovemment. In your second letter you wrote to say that you had received letters from the Hharif, asking you to unite ynuroolf with him and to render him assistance, and you continued that pending your learning the views of fee British Govern-©nt, you had replied to the Sharif that if he was sincere in his intentions towards you, he should first give you a solemn undertalcing to abstain in future fro© all intrusion within your /limits and among your tribes* You wrote that you would communicate again with me, Then you i received his reply* . LastlyILastly I l*av 9 your letter of trie 3rd September in ehich you explained tii&amp;t you would lifee to be informed whether the question of co-operation with the Sharif or of attaching Bin Rashid was considered by us to be merely a matter of the internal politics of the Arab Chiefs, or whether they were questions in which the interest© of the British Government war© also involved, I have thought it convenient thus to surrnarl ze your Idtcellancy*s letters, so that your enquiries could be more clearly answered. On receipt of your con uni cations, X referred to sy Qovemnmit as you desired bo, and because it was not possible for me to give you the authority to answer without doing so, there has been as a result some delay in the com uni cation of this reply to your Excellency, me re ult of my reference is this A® regards the Sharif f 6 intentions, t.. # s ciovernment, according to the information and knowledge which they possess have no reason whatever to thinfc that he has any evil inten tion against your tribes or your territories* On the contra ry H,£. regarde your Excellency as hie friend and co-adjutorj and as for ourselves vis-a-vis yourself and the Sharif, have we not our treaty with you in article one of which we have recognized you as independent ruler of your territories of srejd ? Of course the Sharif must naturally recognize this treaty also, and H*M*s Government would by no means support him in any other attitude toward® you* As to the question of co-operation with the S&gt;urif, or abstention from co-operation, cuid your enquiry as to whether this is &amp; matter of the politics of the Arabs, or Whether the interest® of the British -overnmsnt are also involved, I will try to make the position clear to you. It is not hidden from you that in the first instance. hreatGreat Britain had no wish to go to war with Turkey; but it became necessary simply because Turkey fell under the control of Germany who thrust her Into hostilities with us. But when by decree of fate a state of war arose, the British Government said to themselves *How that the Turks have gratuitously plunged into war with us, we will have no more of them, and we will do our beet to expel them from Iraq and Arabia, so that in future we uay be lursime fro® the results of their Intrigues and maladministration and in order that the rulers and the tribes of the Arabs may sain freedom from such a tyrannical Government, and achieve a prosperous future® * Tou will seo therefore that it is the object and interest of the British Government- to expel the Turks from Arabia* You will agree also that It is to the vital interest of your Excellency, and of the Sharif, and of the other great leaders of the Arab countries and tribes to excel the Turks* Thue the object of the British Government and the object of the Chiefs of the Arab states are one and the ©am©; and it is therefore In the interest of us all that there should be oo-oneration between all, so that the common - - object may be realised* It is for thee© reasons that the British Government greatly desire the success of the Sharif, and regard it as highly desirable and most Important tn&amp;t you should co-operate with him to the utmost of your power* It is not hidden from you that your name carries a great prestige among the Arabs, and, according to ssy informa tion, many of the Shaikhs are only waiting to so© what your attitude is before deciding upon their own* If tuey near that Bin 3 a f ud|fa openly supporting and helping t&amp;ie Sharif, they will quickly take ur arms in his behalf; but if, on the other hand, they hear t .at Sin Sa*ud is stand lug aloof, they also will stand aloof* iou will see tuerefore how important it is that you should make it ol?&amp;r to the Arab public that you, the Euler of Hajd, are in sympathy with the Sharif,Sharif 9 and iw® assisting him t*o sxpsl th© ^^urlcs froM Arabia. As to how you can best do that, whether by helping his with .money and men, or by attacking Bin Hashid,or by winning th© latter over to your side* this is a question which you can bsst decide for yourself* E.d»s lovernoent do not wi^i to press you to do this or to do thatf all they wish you to understand is that your open support, whether it be moral or active, will be of great advantage to the .diarif % cause and to the cor .on object* fou know best how you ©an moot profitably assist th© Sharif without serious prejudice to important interests of jour own. In short I an sure you will realise from the above that It 1 © of the highest importance that not only th© British Government, but all the Ohiofs of Arabs like your self whose present and future interests demand expulsion of the lurks from Arabia, should at this time concentrate their resources and energies on th© achievement of that common object. Compared with that great object, all other objects and interests become for the present Insignificant and need to be deferred until the main object is achieved, (such for instance as the matter of too A jman about which I will write to you separately}* This letter has assumed such length, that 1 will leave di a cusp- ion of the ©trier matters for another letter which I will send via Bahrain in a few day # a time. As regards the general -mr, thing© are going very well indeed with the allies in Europe* Roumania has joined us and Greece has joined and the Allies * armies are gracihtally closing on the enerr-y from all sides. Here in Iraq, a'trig to th© great heat and the long line of eosaumications, no active operation© have wen going on for some weeks, but now the condition© are changing: the weather is getting cold, and the water will coon rise; and our forces in Mesopotamia are much superior to the enemy* But th© actual operationsoperations are conducted in accordance with the general p$an prescribed in the councils of the Allies in Europe, so that it is not in my power to say that we are going to advance on this date or on that date, or in this direction or in that direction. But this you may taow that all is going thoroughly well with us, .and (incidentally) there ar© signs that -nany of the small tribes around Hariri yah, who have been endeavouring to annoy us in small matters at the instigation of the Turks, have got tired of the deceptions and false promises of emissaries like iishar Pasha, and are inclined to ask our forgiveness and seek friendship with us.

I am at Koweit with Bin Sand and Sheikhs ol Koweit and After discussion with Bin Sand at Ojair I reported that any effective co-operation on his part in direction of Hedjaz was impracticable. 11, how ever we and Shereef consider it would be helpful, Bin Sand is prepared to send one of his sons or near relation accompanied by about oO followers to loin manoeuvres as a token of his identification with Shereef s cause. nn Sand would, however, like a friendly request to this effect to come from Reason for this latter condition is that though ready to sink his personal differences in common cause Bin Sand is extremely bitter against the Shereet personally, and not without just reason. It will be remembered that on t y 18 month's ago when Bin Sand was engaged in suppressing the rebellious Aim an tribesmen, Sheikh Abdallah took advantage of Ins preoccupation to make incursion into Qasim and raise difficulties for Bin hand there. Again, quite recently, when Bin Sand wrote to Shereet expressing readiness to co-operate, lint asking for assurances of immunity from interference in future, Shereef replied by returning his letter and enclosure with most discourteous and arrogant covering note, which Bin Sand has passed on to me in original. He feels very strongly about this. It could only be obliterated by blood. His own letter was rather long winded but contained nothing discourteous.P, l+%b L ' I From Sir l\ Cox, 2 1st November 1916.

Some weeks ago Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, after consulting us, sent congratulatory letter to the Shereef. His replies have just reached Basra, and, at Sheikh of Mohammerah’s request, I instructed my deputy open one and telegraph purport. He replied :—“ It is a formal acknowledgment of Sheikh’s letter, couched, as far as I can judge, in an off-hand and patronising style. Sheikh’s name is on envelope, hut the place for his name in the letter is left blank as if it was a carelessly despatched circular. Letter to Sheikh of Koweit is no doubt identical.” Such lack of courtesy can do no good to Shereef’s cause (or) ours, and I hope that he will be given a hint to mend his ways in this respect. rP.

Bin Sand arrived at Koweit in H.M.S. “ Juno ” yesterday evening much pleased and impressed with voyage and with H.M. Ship. This evening, 20th No vemb er, Durbar took place at Sheikh’s residence at which Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah and Bin Sand were present and about 200 Durbaris, composed of the principal inhabitants and some Bedouin headmen of Shammar Aslam and Dhafir. After delivery of decoration and a tew-words from me, three Sheikhs above-mentioned vied with each other in expressing their enthusiasm for their attachment to Great Britain. Sheikh of Mohammerah gave the lead with an exceedingly pro-British harangue and was followed by Bin Sand who gradually warmed to his work and delivered a most animated speech in which he cited and dwelt upon the iniquities committed by the Turks against the other Muslims, said that they w r ere outside the pale of Islam, and went on to impress upon his hearers complete contrast between our policy and that of the Turks, viz., that whereas Turks had continually tried to disintegrate Arabs and foment their differences, we were encouraging them to unite for the common good. He eulogised action of Sherif and urged obligation of all true Arabs to supply him. Finally, all three Sheikhs swore to work together with us and for us for the achievement of common end. There was much enthusiasm and the scene was a most edifying and memorable one, news of which will travel far.A U- Ci 33 Memorandum from the Chief Political Officer (copy forwarded to Director, Eastern Bureau, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Political Secretary, India Office, London, Chief of the General Staff, Indian Expeditionary Force “ D ^ and Army Department), No. 63, dated the 14th October 1916. TRANSLATION. ' ■ *' ’ij ’T. „ . ' v •} . -1 ■ (Amieate op Mecca the respected.) No. In the name of the compassionate and merciful God. To the Gallant and Vigorous Amir Abdul-Aziz Pasha Bin Ahd-er-Rahman Al-Saood, (May God save him). May salams and the mercy of God and His blessings rest on you. —It is not hidden from you that the time-honoured designs of Sheriff Hussein Bin Ali Oni have had this result, viz.) they have displeased the faithful and all Moslems and those who obey the Prophet, and have resulted in his actually joining the enemy of religion and of the Kingdom of the Moslem Caliphate at a time when the Amir-ul-Moomanin ordered all Moslems to declare the sacred jehad against the Powers fighting against our Moslem Kingdom. Instead of doing his share of jehad in this universal war, the said Sheriff Hussein, availing himself of the opportunity of the Government being busied in protecting the Ottoman Dominions and defending the rights of all Moslems, revolted against the Sultan, and, declaring his time-honoured evil designs, actually joined the British Government, which is in hostilities with our Kingdom, and brought the enemy to Jeddah and Yanbo-el-Bahr, and allowed them to enter into the pure and sacred lands, and has permitted the blood shed of innocent Moslems in the peaceful towns without fearing God, or think ing of the evil consequences which will recoil on him and his defeated followers. And whereas both he and his sons attempted to seduce some of the humble-minded simple Shaikhs by false promises and by the small sums of money which he distributes from the funds of the British and so leads them to loss and destruction, it became necessary to dismiss him, so that things might be restored to their proper owners. The Amirate of Mecca the respected has, therefore, been assigned to me. Depending on him who does not fail to answer our hopes and to provide us with the spirituality of our ancestor, our Lord the Prophet of God, we, all Moslems and the inhabitants of the pure and peaceful town {i.e., Medina) have determined to conduct hand in hand with our Moslem Kingdom and her eternal and victorious soldiers the greatest of jehad to disinfect the Qibla from this sin. We cannot believe that the Arab Chieftains will tolerate this disloyalty on part of Hussein, which he is worthy to be stained by, and which will form a black page both for him and all like him, in the history of Islam and which will cause their defeat in this world and the world to come, apart from the terrible sufferings he will have to bear. No doubt that all Moslems, especially the wise and religious Arab Chiefs will free themselves from, and reject with all their force, this great disgrace, and will sacrifice themselves in defending with their Moslem Government, their Qibla, which is the Qibla of all who admit of God’s unity ; so that they may gain the victory in the Most Terrible Day. Therefore we inform you of the event, for the sake of avoiding ambiguity, and we call upon you to perform your religious duty towards your Qibla. «i if- i34 r - i H I; fell ? 4 l ! r ;r' f 1 # 111 . ;] life r fff And to you is sent a copy* containing an explanation of the same affair , , .. , , , r , , which after you have inspected and read in buiietmk. through, its contents will be appreciated p. z. cox. y 0U&gt; I am confident that those who respect their religion and possess a particle of soundness of mind, will defend the Qibla of all Moslems with his life, money and sons, and will purge it from sin and from infidels, so that infidels may retreat with loss. Therefore you, O Amir, need no more explanations : No doubt that you are one of those who appreciate matters. We pray God the Most High to enable us all to bring victory for our religion, and to protect the two Holy Places. We are, therefore, expecting soon after the arrival of this our letter that you will very promptly take satisfactory measures. May God guide and help us all. And salams are the best conclusions.

Translation of letter from Ibn Sand to Sir Percy Cox, dated 13th Zhil Kaadeh (=12th Septem ber 1916). After enquiring about your precious health, I inform you that I am, thanks to God, quite well and am upholding my regard and friendship of you. And I beg to state that I sent you several letters, but till now have not received their replies; may the motive be favourable. My thoughts, to say the truth, always turn to you, and am very anxious to hear of your health and of your pleasing good news of the victories of the Great Government and her Allies. I also state that in these days I received from Haidar, the new Sheriff in Medina, who claims to be Amir of Mecca, a letter accompanied by a proclamation, which I think you will like to peruse. I have written a suitable letter to him, and have explained to him the resentment of Arabs towards him, and towards the Turks, by reason of their actions, which have caused all Arabs to hate and pursue them. This is only written for the purpose of sending you these papers. I request you to continue your regard for me, and send me the news of your good health. May the Creator preserve you safely.

Have you any further observations to offer on Cox’s telegram of October 6th, regard ing Ibn Sand’s letter of September 3rd ? If disposition to play off Egyptian against Indian authorities is indicated by section 15 of Ibn Sand’s letter of July 20th, Cox should discourage any such attempts and allay suspicion that British Government would sacrifice his interests or that Sheriff is not acting in good faith, his deposition by the Turks could be cited in proof of this. Though he is of small military value against Turks, Ibn Saud can assist indirectlv bv holding Ibn Rashid in check and prevent him attacking Basrah or Sheriff The capture of Hail need not be involved by this. With the view expressed in your telegram of the 30th September, a limited offensive of this kind would not be inconsistent, and he might be encouraged to undertake it in his own interest. Cox might report actual requirements if some assistance in the way of munitions is really needed.,■ ; i !i Memo, No. 58, dated Basrah, the 5th October 1916.

Translation of a letter from Ibn Saud to Sir Percy Cox, dated the 3rd September 1916. After compliments .—With a cordial and respectful hand I have received your letter, dated the 15th July 1916 ( = 14th Ramzan 1334) and was pleased to hear of your good health. All that Your Honour communicated to me has been understood by your sincere friend. ^ The august letter of His Excellency Lord Chelmsford, the new Viceroy and Governor-General of India, which Your Honour enclosed, together with the Arabic translation thereof, has reached me safely. I thank you very much : I am greatly obliged and thankful for its highly valued contents. I pray God that His Excellency’s footsteps may be blessed with good fortune and prosperity. I beg to represent to you that I was tardy in answering His Excellency’s auspicious letter, as owing to my not being acquainted with your ceremonial customs I was not sure whether I should answer at once or after a short while, and owing to my intimacy with Your Honour I was anxious to obtain your advice on the point. Your Honour informed me with regard to events and news in a previous letter despatched through His Majesty’s Consul at Bahrain, all of which news I have understood thoroughly. Your Honour also stated with reference to news from the Hedjaz that El Idrisi, assisted by the Sheriff, had captured the town of Kunfidah, one of the ports of the Red Sea, with its Citadel and the troops there. This is very likely true, because the Idrisi has been disobedient to the orders of the Turks from the beginning, and according to what I have heard, his ideas are sound and he is zealous, both for the Arabs and for Islam: and truly one who possesses zeal for the Arabs and for Islam is bound to fight the Turks. You went on to inform me that the newspaper “ Al Mukattam” had reported that the Arabs from Medina to Damascus were backing the Sheriff, hut you said you had not yet received official news to that effect. With regard to the news of the Sheriff at Al Medina, the latest reached me on the 15th Shawal (15th August). It was to the effect that about 7,000 Infantry and Cavalrv had arrived at Medina, and that immediately on arrival they had come into conflict with the sons of the Sheriff and that* a skirmish had taken place at long range at a place about 4 hours to the south of Medina. After that the Turks had become superior to the sons of the Sheriff in numbers and strength and consequently the latter had had to fall hack to a place called Rabegh, on the coast of the Red Sea, between Mecca and Medina.'With regard to the fighting among the tribesmen of the Hedjaz, whose country and habitat extends from Medina to Jeddah and Yenbo, they had become separated into two divisions; the Bani Salim and Bahdah are siding with the Turks : but the Masruh are with the sons of the Sheriff. On their return after the skirmish that took place between them and the sons of the Sheriff, the Turks attacked Awali (a town near Medina which has considerable date gardens belonging to a tribe called the Beni Ali who had been siding with the sons of the Sheriff in revolt against the Turks) and bombarded the town, plundered it, outraged the people and perpetrated iniquit ies upon them. A Sheriff has now been created at Constantinople, who is named Hydar. They claim that he is a new Amir for Mecca. There arrived with him a deputation and some troops and on their arrival at Medina they committed barbarous acts against the townspeople, imprisoning and hanging them. No one who possesses zeal for Islam and Arab patriotism can tolerate such things. This is the latest news received from Medina. At this moment, while writing, I have received news that on account of what the Turks perpetrated at Awali and against the townsmen of Medina, the Harb (Beni Salim) and the A1 Bahdah, who had previously sided with the Turks, came to an understanding with the Masruh who are co-operating with the sons of the Sheriff, and all of them joined forces and became one. They ambushed the Turks and cut their communications in and out of Medina, on account of the Turks’ brutal proceedings. My informant also alleges that the Harb sent to the sons of the Sheriff asking them to advance towards Medina and the surrounding places with a view to cutting communications wdth the town and destroying the railway. This is the news which reaches me while writing, but God knows whether it is true. Inshallah, I shall inform you when it is confirmed. According to what we learn about the doings of the Turks, their oppression and tyranny of anyone who comes w ithin their reach is such that it is clear and certain that they will never set their affairs aright and will never succeed. Then Your Honour spoke to me regarding Bin Rashid. I have just heard news of his arrival at his dwelling place—Hail. Thank God he is certainly in evil plight. With reference to your hope that you would hear soon about the doings of my men in that direction, I have explained to Your Honour in my previous letter the primary difficulty. Now I beg to inform you that the difficultv in the way of attacking Bin Rashid in the neighbourhood of Hail at present is not due to any strength in him which prevents it, nor to any weak ness in me or my forces, but it arises from political reasons which make it inexpedient to force hostilities on them at present. But whether it be a question of fighting with Bin Rashid or other Arabs in enmity with the British Government, or of co-operation and assistance to people like the Sheriff (problems concerning us in our dealings with one another and affected by our individual views and interests) it is evident and well-known to Your Honour that none of us will let an opportunity pass which will benefit us against the enemy, and that the reason for abstention from action is that we are watching for such an opportunity as, please God, will secure a successful issue. If, however, the case is otherwise, and if you discern in the matter anything con ducive to my interests and yours, there is no doubt that I will not, Inshallah, deviate from your opinion or your point of view after consultation between us, either in writing or by confidential messenger, or there might be a meeting between me and Your Honour at any place you please, so that we could exchange views on the subject. That is what I should like best, for there are necessarily many matters in one’s mind which affect the interests of both parties. If vou so order it and if you think it advisable that we should have a meeting, you must give me sufficient notice to enable a meeting to he aiianged. 1 will await a reply to this letter and the receipt of your instructions. Inshallah, you will inform me of good and gratifying news of the victories of the Great Government in Iraq and elsewhere. It is ever our hope that vour friendship with me will be perpetual. In conclusion, I wish you good health and prosperity.u iii . r I j Telegram R., No. 5558, dated the 29th (received 30th) October 1916.

From ViceroyF rom Viceroy, 2nd February 1915 ( Repeated to Cairo, r epeated t o Private. Since my arrival at Koweit letters have reached me from Bin Saud, Captain Shakespear, dated 19th January. Former writes in most friendly terms (corrupt group) expressing his keen regret at impossibility of reaching Koweit in time to meet me, gratification at prospect of establishment of close relations, and begs me to convey his homage to His Majesty the King. Captain Shakespear writes to report that on 17th January a messenger reached Bin Saud with letters from Sharif of Mecca and his son Abdulla, who acts as leader of his father' s_forces. Abdulla wrote that he had arrived at Medina at the urgent instance of Turks, who were pressing his father to mobilise his tribesmen and proclaim holy war, but that before embarking on such a course they were anxious to know Bin Saud's views and attitude. Answering this letter in consultation with Shakespear Bin Saud is said to have urged Sharif to avoid compliance on the pretext that such action would only result in British reprisals on Jeddah. He went on to explain to Sharif the tactics which he himself had adopted for temporising with the Turks, and assured him that he saw no advantage in siding with them. With thus reply he enclosed copies of our circular letter to the Gulf Chiefs, our proclamation regarding holy places, and the statement of our case against Turkey. This measure of co-operation on the part of Bin Saud is most useful, and is as much as we can expect in the absence of a treaty with him. Were a satisfactory document executed we might hope with Bin Saud's assistance not only to ensure maintenance of Sharif’s neutrality, but even his active support^ as well as Bin Saud’s. The above‘con siderations prompt me to press for authority to conclude preliminary treaty without deilay. On the other hand news has reached Koweit C? which) is still unconfirmed, that Bin Saud has met with check at the hands of Bin Rashid, and it may be Q? preferable to} await news fromeasing .eet i from Shakespear. If, however, before I leave Basrah, news of result of collision between the two Arab Chiefs does not alter situation, draft treaty could be sent to Shakespear for negotiation simultane ously with cordial response from myself to Bin Saud’s letter. There is good reason to hope that in that case satisfactory result might be obtained and that Bin Baud would come off the fence and definitely throw in his lot with us, which is very desitable in every way. idalla id icy have to holy asure From Viceroy, H.M.S.

Owing to his unavoidable absence it was impossible to confer upon him either order.

(Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India, and.Basra, for communication to Army Commander.) 033- Dated 13th November. I met Bin Sand at Ojair, 11th November and 12th November. I will report details as soon as possible, but upshot is that effective co-operation towards Hejaz is not practicable, but demonstration against Ibn Rashid is feasible with certain material assistance which I will specify later. Ibn Saud is now coming on from Ojair to Bahrein with a view to proceeding thence on a rapid visit to Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah by water. As I am convinced that this will be highly beneficial, I have ventured to encourage project, and Commodore is kindly arranging for H.M.S. “Juno” to convey Ibn Saud and retinue to Koweit. From Mohammerah, if Army Commander sees no objection, I will arrange for brief visit to Basra where Ibn Saud will be impressed with solidarity of our position and extent of our organisation. From Mohammerah he will be conveyed back to Ojair. I bn Saud has recently given ocular proof of his hostility to lurks by arresting their emissary and handing .over 700 camels bought by him to our agent. On my pending visit to Koweit, 1 had arranged to deliver C.b.L. to Sheikh on behalf' of Government. I would recommend that _ 1 may be authorised to announce on the same occasion the grant by His Majesty of the K.C.I.E. to Ibn Saud and to invest him with it. I could use my own Star and Badge or those of the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the purpose. Decoration was contemplated in foreign Departments telegiam 23 D, dated 7th January 1915.

'w' After Compliments /, If! V I despatched a letter to four Honour recently; Inshallah you duly received it and it found you in the best of health. It is some little time since I received any letter from Your J Honour communicating to me the good news of your victories over the evil doers. I am always waiting for your good news in that connection. After writing my peevious letter to you, I -received from the Gherif of Mecca letters conveying the good nows of his occupation of Mecca with the assistance of your guns. He asked me to render him assistance and to unite myself with him. I have written back saying that as regards assistance I will not fail to render it to the utmost of my power. As to union with him I have remarked that I have no designs on has country, i.e. the Hedjaz and its surroundings : whereas, on the other hand, he, in the past, has been in the habit of interfering with my tribes and my territory’, allrging that this has been done at the instance of the Turks and that it was tbejr who wore prompting him to do so. I contended that if he meant to be sincere and desired to be united with me and that we should work hand in hand, he should give me an under taking and a solemn promise for the immunity of my territories and my subjects, and for abstention from trespassing in our limits, or from interference with our subjects. If his reply is in the affirmative and he acts loyally, no effort on my part will, please God, be spared to help him to the best of my ability. 2 My motive in replying as above is not due to any desire on my part to ally myself with him, for you are awareof his previous relations with me : but it was due, firstly, to the fact of my alliance with yourselves, aid secondly, to my hatred of the Turks. I am anxious to further anything that may assist to expel them. Go, if he answers in the af firmative and assures me that he has no aim other than real friendship, well and good. If he is seeking to impose on • * me so that he may achieve his own independence and render himself free to start his old interference with me, then / the matter is merely one between him and me, I shall look after myself to the best of my ability. But if, on the contrary, the matter concerns your Great Government, I should, in that case, like to do whatever is convenient to you, I have therefore referred the matter to you. In any case the Sherif T s boundaries and territories are well known; and a further reference will be made to you, Inshallah, when I receive his reply, 0/ I also have to inform four Honour that I have re cently learnt that the Ajman, who lately with Ibn Rashid in the neighbourhood of Zobeir, had, on account of the peace between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Subah, come to an under standing with both those Chiefs,(soon after the departure of Ibn Rashid from that neighbourhood and his contact with Ibn Twala and Ibn Swait,) to the effect that they should settle in the territories of Ibn Subah, jr This is not as it should be. I have explained * to Your Honour regarding the Ajman and their attitude to wards me. They are outlaw subjects of mine and the reason of their contumacy was their support by Ibn Subah and their stay at Kuwait, and this will certainly cause friction between me and Ibn Subah, for my subjects are bound to pursue the feud with the Ajman and so am I.

He makes no allusion to receipt of any fresh communication from Sherif but apparently means his present letter to be the 'further reference ' which he promised as reported in my telegram Ho,4523 of 7th September, As regards question of attacking Bin Rashid in or near Hail he first alludes to need for guns before mentioned but then goes on to say only present obstacle is that political juncture appears to him unfavourable. He then observes that if questions of attacking Bin Rashid or assisting Sherif are merely matters of policy concerning chiefs inter se then it is a question of watching for such a suitable opportunity as will ensure successful result and this be ’ 1 they may/counted upon to do. If on the other hand either project affects our interests as well as his own, he says that he will no doubt conform to our views and wishes after discussion with me preferably at personal meeting. With army commander f s permission I could arrange to bring off a meeting with him towards latter pert of this month, but if it is not desired to press upon him any specific form of action it would perhaps be better not to have meeting just now, but simply inform him that His majesty's Government hope he will do Lis utmost to support Sherif in whatever way he considers fit and xeasible* Let me know wishes of Government on this point.

But otherwise we should be content with immense asset welhave secured in the passive friendship of Nejd. We certainly cannot spare guns while despatch of 1,000 Nejd tribesmen to support Arab Revolt would be of little material value to Sherriff, would weaken Bin Saud vis-a-vis Bin Rashid and might lead to subsequent embarrassing claims by Bin Saud against Sherriff. Repeated Basra and Cairo as No. 720 S.I 4-030 L o ' w at £.WEy wi From .Sir' P. Cox, Basra, 27th September 1916 G^j A (Addressed to foreign, repeated to Secretary of State, andHdig Commissioner, Cairo.) j Please see correspondence regarding Bin Sand ending with Secretary of State’s telegram dated 20th, and my Bureau telegram 4890. New Commander-in-Chief in India is expected within next few days, and during his visit all questions having direct or indirect bearing on our operations in Mesopotamia will doubtless be discussed. As regards Bin Saud, I imagine that he has some qualms of conscience in respect of undertakings given by him to Turks in his Treaty with them of May 1914, and will not, if he can avoid it, enter actively into lists against them. If we confine ourselves to exhortations in general terms he will probably do no more than continue to worry Bin Rashid in a desultory way at a respectful distance from Hail. I am of opinion that he is not able and would not be willing to attack Hail without assistance from us in guns with men to man them as well as money. If he were willing to do so with such assistance, would it be worth our while to give it ? Short of that^he could be ^ definitely pressed to arm and equip with transport a contingent of, say (five or-eixA)“ hundred ” .omitted}'of his own tribesmen mounted on camels and send them to join the Sherif. » . I have already urged him to arrest Turkish^ emissary, Ibn 1 araoon and him getfxamels. He may do latter but certainly not the former. Hoes any other farm of assistance w, could render suggest itself. As regards expression “ (iCutitul.ion ?) ' The word Kingdom in English or Arabic pre-supposes a king, and my fear was that Sherif in sending letter or emissary to Bin Sand might quote term to him, and that Bin Saud would certainly be alarmed by it. The terms “ Arab Confederation or “ Arab League ” present to my mind a widely different conception which admits of frank discussion with any Arab Chief. 4 nv3 ? CCfCL$r d 1CkA^I/I^uM^Ua, ^ P 3c|S^o. Ci^Jj FromJBasra, 24:th September 1910 (Signed ' l Arbur, 4896 ”). (Addressed Uy Arhux, Cairo, repeated to Foreign and Secretary of State ) lijtendecj amplification of my telegram, 4625, dated 12th. Originals of intercepted documents therein quoted have now reached me. Following is the purport of two of them : — In first item writer states Jamal Pasha had telegraphed to Bin Rashid calling on him to proceed to Hail and sending him an order for 2,000 bags of rice, 1,000 Hour, 100 sugar, 100 coffee and 3,000 abba cloaks, all to be delivered to him at Samawa. On receipt of a copy of this telegram Mahomed Asaimi informed acting Wali that Bin Rashid had already left, that proposal was impracticable as they (would not be ?) safe at Samawa, and owing to bad relations between tribes of Iraq his caravans were liable to be looted. I (transmit?) second item in exteuso : — “ The reason which has prompted Turks to call upon Bin Rashid to proceed to Hail and to give him these large presents and decorations and to make him ‘ Commandant ’ of Nejd is on account of movements of Sherif, They fear lest Bin Rashid should join him, and they are convinced that Hail is an important point and that if they lose it whole Arabian Peninsula as far as Damascus will unite. They have accordingly been driven to this measure, and Sherif and all tribes of Hejaz have started a very serious movement. The Government have nominated another Sherif, Hydar Pasha ; and as far as can be seen in view of force at Medina they intend to leave Hejaz until end of war. “ They will only defend Medina and Hail in force. This is what seems likely.” In a third item he writes,: — “The tribal situation from Mosul to (Samawa?) is not good, their attitude has changed. “In particular the Anazeh of Ibn Hazhzhal have joined Nejf and Kerbela and Dilam in making trouble. In short, affairs are not satisfactory. May God put things right and your Honour must take necessary steps to strengthen your position on your side with Zayyad, for we do not know what may happen.” .V *1, * '(• femsTC ■ 1 ' (w ■ ite'VU [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, j and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless 7 — — ■ ■ required for official use.] r — •V377 37/16)..

Cox, 9//z September 1916. (Add) essed to hurcau. Cairo, and repeated to Foreign, Simla, and Secretary War Office.) In reply to (?) letter of 25th June, of which copy was sent Bureau on 9th July, Chief Political Officer has received long letter, dated 25th July, fiom Bin Sued. Copy is being posted (meanwhile ’?). following (mav be?) of present interest. Referring to Chief Political Officer’s disappointment at his not having moved against Bin Rashid, he explains that his expedition against Almurrah was aa urgent necessity m our joint interests, for had it not been undertaken the Almurrah would have joined Bin Bashid and given trouble to us. Finally, he says, in absence of guns and ammunition it was futile for him to think of advancing or entering into general war with Turks. Commenting on news sent him regarding Sherif, he says he was pleased to get it because it meant in any case a severe blow to Turks and perhaps the complete expulsion of Turks from Arabia. He goes on to remark, however, that wording of official communique, referring, as it does, to “the Arabs as a whole, causes him considerable apprehension and makes it necessary for him to remind us that there has been a feud between him and Sherif for years on account of Sherif s persevering endeavours to interfere amongst tribes and settlements of Nejd. He (Bin Saud) has always opposed \ this, and he and his tribesmen will never tolerate any control on the part of j Sherif o^t interference within their boundaries which are well recognised and detined. He expresses belief that Sherif’s original intention vvas to j play off British against Turks and thus get Turks to grant him independence guaranteed by Germany. In conclusion he recommends us to give Sherif just enough assistance to ensure protraction of the struggle between him and Turks and thus keep them employed and unable to detach troops to Iraq. r \ he above is repeated with reference to your telegram dated 8th September.l(* 3(055” From Arbnr, Basra, 8th September 1916. (Addressed to Bureau,, Cairo, for informatioFyrepeatedQ to Foreign and Secretary of State for information and favour of instructions ) 45-3 Please see my telegram, No. 4455, dated 5th September. Further letter has now been received from ibn Sand, dated 15th August, mainly regarding Sherif. Following is summary :— “ Ibn Sand has received letters from Sherif asking for alliance and assist ance. tie has sent reply saying as regards ‘ assistance ’ he will respond to best of his power. As regards ‘ alliance ’ he reminds Sherif that whereas he (Ibn Sand) has never had designs upon Hedjaz, the Sherif on the other hand has habitually endeavoured to interfere amongst tribes and territories of Ibn Sand That if Sherif is now sincere in his desire for alliance he should give a solemn undertaking to abstain from all interference in Ibn Sand’s limits or amongst his subjects.” Commenting on above Ibn Sand remarks that he has no personal wish to ally himself with Sherif but has entertained proposal, firstly, because we desire it and, secondly, in hope of expelling Turks, lie continues that if relations between him and Sherif merely concern themselves he will comply with request for alliance in the ev'ent of a satisfactory reply being received. If, however, reply gives impression that Sheriffs (? group omitted) is to deceive Ibn Sand and seek to exert control over him then Ibn Saud will take steps to protect his own interests. On the other hand if his relations with Sherif are a matter of concern to us and importance to our policy he will be guided by our wishes and in any case will make a further reference to me on getting Sherif’s reply. With reference to foregoing please see Sherif’s letter dated 5th November 1915. In his reply of 13th December High Commissioner specifically assumed that Sherif’s recognition of our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs applied to “ all territories included in Arab Kingdom.” It is earnestly hoped and understood that we have decided to regard this latter (corrupt group) as defunct as far as we are concerned, but can we safely assume that it is also dead in mind of Sherif ? In any case it is very necessary to inform Bin Saud definitely that no present or future understandings between us and Sherif will prejudice our adherence to terms of Articles I. and II. of our Treaty with him of 2oth December 1915, and that meanwhile it is highly important that he should unite with Sherif in championing common cause of chiefs and tribes of Arabia, the emancipation of whom is one of chief features of British P oli( W It is for consideration whether terms of our Treaty with Bin Saud should not be communicated to Sherif at the same time. I await comment before replying to Bin Saud whose messenger waiting. h3 s. 30?. A B. 222. This Document is the properly of His Majesty’s Seereta nj of State for India. SECRET. Correspondence with the Grand Sherif of Mecca. 1. 1 el eg lain to Mi. Clieetluun, Cairo, from foreign Office, dated 24th September 1914. No. 219. Secret. • Following from Lord Kitchener :— Intelligence report 6th September, statement regarding- attitude of Sherif of Mecca. Tell Storrs to send secret and carefullv chosen messenger Korn me to Sherif Abdullah to ascertain whether “ should present armed “ German influence at Constantinople coerce Calif against his will and “ Sublime Forte to acts of aggression and war against Great Britain, he and his father and Arabs of liedjaz would lie with us or against us.” 2.- -lelegram from Mr. Cheetham, Cairo, to Foreign Office dated 31st October 1914. No. 233. Your telegram No. 219. Messenger has returned from Mecca with letter from Sherif Abdalla. Communication is guarded, but friendly and favourable. Desires “closer union ” with Great Britain, but expects and “ is awaiting written promise “ that Great Britain will abstain from internal intervention in Arabia and “ guarantee Emir against Foreign and Ottoman aggression.” Sherif himself m a secret conversation with messenger, expressed himself more freely and openly, saying “ Stretch out to us a helping hand and we will never aid these oppressors.” Messenger was received and treated with great consideration, it should be noted that Sherif Abdalla is only repeating without any additions proposals he made to His Majestv’s Agency on 8th Januarv fo-roun undecypherable). ^ Reply is being prepared subject to your approval disclaiming all intention of internal intervention and guaranteeing, against external aggression only, independence of Sherifate. Messenger must leave Monday morning or week will be lost. Please instruct me at once. 3.—Telegram to Mr. Cheetham, Cairo, from Foreign Office, dated 31st October 1914. No. 303. Your telegram No. 233 of 31st October. Following from Lord Kitchener. Lord Kitchener’s salaam to the Sherif Abdalla, Germany has bought the Turkish Government with gold, notwithstanding that England, France and Russia guaranteed integrity of the Ottoman Empire if Turkey remained neutral in this war. The Turkish Government have against the wish of the Sultan through German pressure committed acts of war by invading the frontiers of Egypt with armed bands followed by Turkish soldiers which are now massed at Akaba to invade Egypt. If the Arab nation assist England in this war that has been forced upon us by Turkey, England will guarantee that no internal intervention takes place in Arabia and will give the Arabs every assistance against external foreign aggression. It may be that an Arab of the true race will assume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina and so good may come by the help of God out of all evil which is now occurring.9 4.—Communication from Mr. Cheetham 1o Sherif Abdalla. A fter compliments and thanks. We have understood your reasons and acknowledge the justice of your request. So we have sent to Lord Kitchener (titles) who has replied as follows — Salaams to Sherif Abdalla (titles). That which we foresaw has come to pass. Germany has bought the Turkish Government with gold notwith standing that Great Britain, France and Bussia guaranteed the integrity of the Ottoman Empire if Turkey remained neutral in this war. The Turkish Government have against the wish of the Sultan and through German pressure committed acts of war by invading without provocation the frontiers of Egypt with armed bands followed by Turkish soldiers which are now massed at Akaba to invade Egypt, so that the cause of the Arabs, which is the cause of freedom, has become the cause also of Great Britain. If the Amir (titles) and Arabs in general assist Groat Britain in this conflict that has been forced upon us by Turkey, Great Britain will promise not to intervene in any manner whatsoever whether in things religious or otherwise. Moreover, recognising and respecting the sacred and unique office of the Amir Ilosayn (titles) Great Britain will guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sherifate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till now we have defended and befriended Islam in the person of the Turks: henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arab. It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina, and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil which is now occurring. It would be w’ell if Your Highness could, convey to your followers and devotees, who are found throughout the world, in every country, the good tidings of the Freedom of the Arabs, and the rising of the sun over Arabia. 5.—Communication, unsigned and undated, handwriting of Sherif Abdalla. Respectable and powerful Friend, After paying due respects, yours of the 12th Zil Hoga has been received with due honour and reverence, and we have taken it as a basis for action and a reference for the present and the future. In accordance with it, and in view of its fidelity and accord, our country has come to hold most conscientiously to your suggestions, and has undertaken to carry out faithfully what we said in our previous letter and wdiat we confirm in the present one ; and has avoided since our foregoing letter all that affects unfavourably your material and moral interests. Yea more, we are endeavouring to discourage any man who seeks to harm these interests— any one of those wdio are outside the pale of the Hedjaz colony. If } ou could perceive our critical position in undertaking the matter you would know that we are doing that which is more important than the peifoimance of that which is natural^ imposed upon us, regardless of whether or not these negotiations take place and w r hether or not an agree ment is arrived at. It is so because religion which justifies it and which is the sole foundation of action, prevents us from working at once. But when the time shall come, and it is not far distant, we can not but accomplish it, even though the Ottoman Empire be not occupied and even though it should muster against us all its army. . In dosing, I would remind you that we act upon the wmrds of him who said, 1 eiform ye the promise ye make to God when 3 *e pledge vourselves.'' We then pa} r to llis Highness and j’oursell our best regards, requesting } 7 ou to keep this correspondence secret until the right time should come.&lt;).- Shorthand Note taken by Messenger of a discourse by the Sherif of Mecca, which took place in privacy at night on the roof of his palace. Ah Bey, please impart my best salaams, laithfulness and friendship to Mr. Storrs, and my acceptance of what In's great Empire has on another occasion proposed. Ali, do your best to make Mr. Storrs understand that he should not consider my answer as a breaking up of relations. It simply came late, and if she had granted our demand when we made it, things would have been better, ilie day will come when we Avill demand more of her than she is now preparing for us, and perhaps soon. Ali, inform Mr. Storrs that 1 am using all my political and material influence in spreading the British policy (influence) m my country as well in that of A1 Imam ^ ehia, as he is my friend and never acts against mv advice. All, 1 urney is weighing down heavily upon us, beyond the power of our endurance. We therefore oppose the execution of its commands and plans. Yesterday they were planning to send printed circulars or posters to the chiefs of the tribes for distribution among the pilgrims. We oppose the project with all our might and diplomacy; we have opposed it almost to the point of breaking up our relation (with them) ; and if the Vali had not returned upon his decision, relations would have been definitely broken up. And perhaps causes might spring up which Avoidd break these relations even before you arrive at your country ; and it might come to pass that the thing Avould be delayed some three or four or six months. Through my political influence, rebellion and disobedience had well nigh broken out among the Syrian corps. England Avili hear about my action, if not now, in the future. Our relations Avith the Empire are warning, dying, even as a flickering lamp Avhose oil had run out. Ali, the only thing that prevents me from rising against the Turkish Empire is the Moslem Avorld, Avhich hoav looks upon me and feels annoyed Avith me, especially under the present circumstances. Another reason is this, 1 cannot forget the fa\ r ours the reigning house bestowed upon me. But the reins of power haA^e passed from the hands of this family. Among the reasons Avhich strengthen the hands of the Turkish statesmen and give weight to their influence and power is the interception of food materials from our land. This thing has caused great want there. More, they (Turks) have informed the people and the Bedouins that it Avas Britain Avhicli intercepted the alms and thus reduced them to their pitiable state. Ali Bey, avc wrestle valiantly, spend much of our substance, and use all our influence to calm down the country. Great Britain Avill learn of our efforts later on. Now we cannot make demands ; avc simply pray her to facilitate the question of grains (the coming in of grains). Be it as it may Ave shall not turn against her or aid her enemies. She shall see. I am bound by three ties; the Caliphate, and, as I have already intimated, the favours which the reigning house bestowed upon me. As to the religious tie, you see them now declare openly that the cause of the degeneration of the Moslem nations is religion, and they set themselves to efface it. Yea, some have come to us to pay a visit to the Holy Places (on pilgrimage) ; and these have mocked and scoffed at the thing, and have not performed their religious duties as it behoves them to do. From this you will perceive that religious matters have become lax. Therefore we are no longer bound to obey them. The second tie concerns our obedience to the Caliphate, but there no longer exists a Caliphate, and that for various reasons, among others that their rule projects plans and deeds that are all contrary to religion. The Caliphate means this, that the rules of the book of God should be enforced, and this they do not do. As to the third, 1 have already intimated that the Turkish Government has come to be nothing more than Enver and his clique. We therefore are no longer bound to them by any tie.1; •II. 4 Notwitlistanding this I am of opinion that it will he better now to put off action. This is due to the reasons explained here above, and to the fact that it will be in our interests that this delay be. Say, Ali, are you satisfied ? Yes, sir. 7.—Communication from Sherif of Mecca to Mr. Storrs, Oriental Secretary to British Representative, Cairo. To the dear honourable, may God protect him, I present to your dear honour my affectionate regards and respects, and hope that you will do your best to make the enclosed note, containino* the proposed conditions, effective, as you are capable of doing. And in this connection I declare to you and your Government that you need not be anxious about the ideas of the people here, because they are closely bound to your Government by community of interests. Do not be at pains to send aeroplanes or men-of-war to throw reports and rumours, as was done before, because the matter is now decided. What we desire to beg you is to open the way for the Egyptian Govern ment to send the charitable offerings of corn for the Holy lands, i.r., Mecca and Medina, which were stopped since last year. For verily, the sending of this grain for this year and last would be an important factor in laying the foundations of our mutual advantage. This should suffice for a person of your grasp. In conclusion 1 offer you my best salaams and respects, ffiid Ramadan 1333 (14th July 1015). Kindly do not trouble to send any correspondence until you see the result of our operations; except the reply to the note and its enclosure which should be through the bearer only ; and, if you should think fit, give him a \\ i itten token to make it easy for him to reach you when we find it necessary. He is all right. Unsigned. 8.—Enclosed with foregoing.

England to approve of the proclamation of an Arab Caliphate of Islam. Secondly .—The Arab Government of the Sherif to acknowledge that England shall have the preference in all economic enterprises in the Arab countries whenever conditions of enterprises are otherwise equal. Thirdly .—For the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to oiler mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties. Fourthly .—If one of the parties enters upon an aggressive conflict, the other party to assume a neutral attitude, and in case of such party wishing the other to join forces, both to meet and discuss the conditions. Fifthly .— England to acknowledge the abolition of foreign privileges in the Arab countries, and to assist the Government of the Sherif in an international Convention for confirming such abolition. Sixthly .—Articles 3 and 4 of this Treaty to remain in vigour for 15 years, and, if either wishes it to be renewed, one year’s notice before lapse of treaty to be given. Consequently, and as the whole of the Arab nation have (praise be to God) agreed and united for the attainment, at all costs and finally, of this noble object,, they beg the Government of Great Britain to answer them positively or negatively in a period of 30 days after receiving this intimation ; and if this period should lapse before they receive an answer, they reserve to themselves complete freedom of action. Moreover we (JSherif’s family) will consider ourselves free in word and deed from the bonds of our previous declaration which we made through Ali Undated and unsigned. 1).—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif Ilosayn (titles). After compliments and salutations. We have the honour to thank you for your frank expressions of the sincerity of your feeling towards England. We rejoice moreover that Your Highness and your people are of one opinion, that Arab interests are English interests and English Arab. To this intent we confirm to you the terms of Lord Kitchener’s message, which reached you by the hand of Ali Effendi, and in which was stated clearly our desire for the independence of Arabia and its inhabitants, together with our approval of the Arab Caliphate when it should be proclaimed. We declare once more that His Majesty’s Government would welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race. With regard to the questions of limits, frontiers and boundaries, it would appear to be premature to consume our time in discussing such details in the heat of war, and while, in many portions of them, the Turk is up to now in effective occupation ; especially as we have learnt, with surprise and regret, that some of the Arabs in those very parts, far from assisting us, are neglecting this their supreme oppor tunity, and are lending their arms to the German and the Turk, to the new despoiler and the old oppressor. Nevertheless we are ready to send to Your Highness for the Holy Cities and the noble Arabs the charitable offerings of Egypt, so soon as Your Highness shall inform us how and where they should be delivered. We are moreover arranging for this your messenger to be admitted and helped on any journey he may make to ourselves. Friendly reassurances. Salutations. (Signed) Sir A. II. McMahon. (Apparently dated 30th August 1915.) Our lust messenger, cide correspondence.6 10.—Communication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to His Excellency the Most Exalted, the Most Eminent, the British High Commissioner in Egypt; may God grant him success. With great cheerfulness and delight I received your letter dated 19th Shawal 1333 (30th August 1915), and have given it great consideration and regard, in spite of the impression I received from it of ambiguity and its tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our essential point. It is necessary to make clear to Your Excellency our sincerity towards the illustrious British Empire and our confession of preference for it in all cases and matters and under all forms and circumstances. The real interests of the followers of our religion necessitate this. Nevertheless, Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coldness and hesitation which you .have displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries by saying that.the discussion of these at present is of no use and is a loss of time and that they are still in the hands of the Government which is ruling them, Ac., might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort. As these limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom we should satisfy and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this. Therefore they have found it necessary first to discuss this point with the Bower in whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the Illustrious British Empire. &gt; (Literal translation of the above passage) : “ And therefore they saw the discussion in it first the place of their confidence and trust the axis of final appeal now and that is the Illustrious British Empire.” Their reason for this union and confidence is mutual interest, the necessity of regulating territorial divisions and the feelings of their inhabitants, so that they may know how to base their future and life, so not to meet her (England ?) or any of her Allies in opposition to their resolution which would produce a contrary issue, which God forbid. (Literal translation of above passage as follows): “ The feelings of its inhabitants to know how to base their future and life for not to meet her or one of its Allies in front of their resolution when the thing comes to a contrary result, which God forbid.” For the object is, honourable Minister, the truth which is established on a basis which guarantees the essential sources of life in future. Yet within these limits they have not included places inhabited by a foreign race. It is no vain show of words and titles. May God have mercy on the Caliphate and comfort Moslems in it. I am confident that Your Excellency will not doubt that it is not 1 personally who am demanding of these limits which include only our race, but that they are all proposals of the people who, in short, believe that they are necessary for economic life. Is this not right, Your Excellency the Minister ? In a word. Your High Excellency, we are firm in our sincerity and declaring our preference for loyalty towards you, whether you arc satisfied with us, as has been said, or angry. \\ ith reference to your remark in your letter above-mentioned that some of our people are still doing their utmost in promoting the interests of Turkey Your Goodness (lit. “ Perfectness”) would not permit you to make this an excuse for the tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our demands, demands which 1 cannot admit that you. as a man of sound opinion, will deny to be necessary for our existence; nay, they are the essential essence of our life, material and moral. I p to the present moment, 1 am myself with all my might carrying out in my country all things in conformity with the Islamic Law, all things whichtend to benefit tlie rest of the kingdom, and I shall continue to do so until it pleases God to order otherwise. In order to reassure Your Excellency, I can declare tliat the whole country, together with those who you say are submitting themselves to Turco-German orders, are all waiting the result of these negotiations, which are dependent only on your refusal or acceptance of the question of the limits and in your declaration of safeguarding their religion first and then the rest of rights from any harm or danger. \\ hatever the illustrious Government of Great Britain finds comformable to its policy in this subject, communicate it to us and specify to us the course we should follow. In all cases it is only God’s will which shall be executed and it is God who is the real factor in everything. With regard to our demand for grain for the natives and the monies (surras) known to the Wakfs Ministry and all other articles sent here with pilgrims’ caravan, 0 High Excellency, my intention in this matter is to confirm your proclamations to the whole world, and especially to the Moslem world, that your antagonism is confined only to the party which has usurped the rights of Caliphate in which are included the rights of all Moslems. Moreover, the said grain is from the special Wakfs, and has nothing to do with politics. If you think it should be, let the grain of the two years be transported in a special steamer to Jeddah in an oflicial manner, in the name of all the natives as usual, and the captain of the steamer or the special Maniur detailed as usual every year to hand it over on his arrival at the port will send to the Governor of Jeddah asking for the Mamur of the grain at Jeddah or a responsible official to take over the grain and give the necessary receipt signed by the said Maniur, that is the Mamur of the grain himself, lie should make it a condition that he would (? not) accept any receipt but that signed by this Mamur. Let the captain of the steamer or the Mamur (detailed with the grain) be instructed that if he finds anything contrary to this arrangement he should warn them that he will return home with the cargo. Thereupon the Mamur and the special committee detailed with, him, which is known as the committee of the grain for the natives, will take over the grain in the proper form. Please accept my best regards and salutations. If you choose to send a reply to this please send it with bearer. 29th Shawal 1333. 9th September 1915. 11.—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca (with titles). I have received your letter of 19th (? 29th) Shawal with much pleasure and your expressions of friendliness and sincerity have given me the greatest satisfaction. 1 regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the limits and boundaries with coldness and hesitation ; such was not the case, but it appeared to me that the moment had not yet arrived when they could be most profitably discussed. I have realized, however, from your last letter that you regard this question as one of vital and urgent importance. 1 liave, theiefoie, lost no fime in informing the Government of Great Britain of llie contents ol \ oui letter and it is with great pleasure that 1 communicate to you on their behalf the following statement, which I am confident you will receive with satisfaction. . The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Homs and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Aral), and should be excluded from the pioposed limits and boundaries. . . . With the above modification, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits and boundaries and, inJ-• Communication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to the lli^h Commissioner, Cairo. (Literal translation.) In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. To His Excel lency the most exalted and eminent Minister who is endowed with the highest authority and soundness of opinion. May God guide him to do His Will. 1 received with great pleasure your honoured letter dated 15th Zul llijj (-4th October 1915), to which I beg to answer as follows (1.) I n order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships— seeing, moieo\er, that we have great consideration Jor the distinguished qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain—we renounce oni insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana m the Aiab Kingdom. But the provinces ol Aleppo and Beyrout and their sea- regard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her Ally, France, 1 am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter : Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca. Great Britain, will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognize their inviolability. When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of Government in those various territories. On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European Advisers and Officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British. With regard to the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, ihe Arabs will recognize that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure tllese territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests. I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her traditional friends the Arabs and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke which for so many years has pressed heavily upon them. 1 have confined myself in this letter to the more vital and important questions, and if there are any other matters dealt with in your letters which I have omitted to mention, we may discuss them at some convenient date in the future. It was with very great relief and satisfaction that I heard of the safe arrival of the Holy Carpet and the accompanying offerings which, thanks to the clearness of your directions and the excellence of your arrangements, were landed without trouble or mishap in spite of the dangers and difficulties occasioned by the present sad war- May God soon bring a lasting peace and freedom to all peoples. I am sending this letter by the hand of your trusted and excellent messenger. Sheikh Mohammed 1 bn Aril Arayfan, and he will inform you of various matters of interest but of less vital importance, which 1 have not mentioned in this letter. (Here follow the usual compliments.) r 24th October 1915.coasts are purely Arab Provinces and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Phaistian Aral); they are both descendants of one forefather We Moslems will follow the footsteps of the Commander of the Faithful— Omni ibn Fhattab and othei C aliphs succeeding him, who ordained in ihe laws of the Moslem faith that Moslems should treat the Christians as they tieat themsehes. He, Omar, declared with reference to Christians, u they will have the same privileges and submit to the same duties as ourselves.” I hey will thus enjoy their civic rights in as much as it accords with the general interest of the whole nation. As the 1 lovinces of Irak are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom and were in fact the seat of its Governments in the time of Ali Ibn Abu Talib, and m the time of all Caliphs who succeeded him 5 and as in them began the civilization of the Arabs, and as their towns in those provinces were the lirst towns built in Islam where the Arab power became so great; therefore these provinces are greatly valued by all Arabs far and near,’and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently, we cannot satisfy the Arab nations or make them submit to give up such a title to nobility. Hut in order to render an accord easy, and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter, to keep and guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, for all these reasons we might agree to leave under the British Administration for a short time those districts now occupied by the British troops, without the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab nation, which interests are to it economic and vital) and against a suitable sum paid as compensation to the Arab kingdom for the period of occupation, in order to meet the expenses which every new kingdom is bound to support, at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especially those which are essential. (3.) In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages but grounds of apprehension. The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party (as has already happened in the past) who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its forces. The second is that standing in the face of Turkey, which is supported by all the forces of Germany, we do not know what Great Britain and her Allies would do if one of the Entente Powers were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation will then be left alone in the face of Turkey together with her Allies, but we would not at all mind if we were to face the Turks alone. Therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration. (4.) The Arab nation has a strong belief that after this war is over, the Turks under German influence will direct their efforts to provoke the Arabs and violate their rights, both material and moral, to wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission as they are determined to ruin them entirely. The reasons for the slowness shown in our action have already been stated. (5.) When the Arabs know that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support and will effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will, no doubt, be in conformity with the general interest of the Arabs. ( 6 .) Our letter dated 29th Shawal 1333 (9th September 1915) saves us the trouble of repeating our opinions as to Articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration, Government advisers and officials, especially as you have declared, 0, Exalted Minister! that you will not interfere with internal affairs. (7.) The arrival of a clear and definite answer as soon as possible, to the above proposals, is expected. AVe have done our utmost in making con cessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both parties. We know10 that our lot in tins war will be either a success which will guarantee to the Arabs a life becoming their past history, or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects 1 would have preferred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain ; but they, the Arabs, May God keep you safe and victorious, as we devoutly hope and desire. After customary greetings and acknowledgment of previous letter. I am gratified to observe that you agree to the exclusion of the vilayets I also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the Arabs are determined to act in conformity with the precepts laid down by Omar Ibn Khattab and the early Caliphs, which secure the rights and privileges of all religions alike. In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab Chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab Kingdom, as the Government of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist. With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beyrout, the Government of Great Britain have taken careful note of your observations, but, as the interests of our Ally France are involved, the question will require careful consideration and a further communication on the subject will be addressed to you in due course. The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, are ready to give all guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognized, a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Baghdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed consideration than the present situation and the urgencv of these negotiations permits. We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and we have no wish to urge you to hasty action, which might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects, but in the meantime it is most essential that you should spaie no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies. It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, when the time foi action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend. Undei these cncumstances I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace, in terms of which the freedom of tiig Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition. As an earnest of our intentions and in order to aid you in your effors in have insisted that 1 should guide the movement to this end.

(Signed) A. H. McMvuox.14.—Communication from the Grand Slierif of Mecca to the High Commissioner. Cairo. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, to His Excellency the eminent, energetic and magnanimous Minister. We received from the bearer your two letters dated 9th Safar (17th December 1915) with great respect and honour, and I have understood their contents, which caused me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction as they removed that which had made me uneasy. Your honour will have realised after the arrival of Mohammed [Faroki] Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present, was of no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly unintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us. These truths are, in my opinion, very important, and deserve your honour’s special attention and consideration. With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning El Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice. As regards the Northern Barts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications, and all this was only done so to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and the agreement made between them during the * present wars and calamities ; yet we find it our duty that the Eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beyrout and its coasts. I do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britain, than it is to us; and will necessarily be so* whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now ; especially as her allies being neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with which there will be no peace of mind. In addition to which the people of Beyrout will decidedly never accept such isolations and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity of our interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate with any other Power but you. Consequently, it is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France, or any other Power, a span of land in those regions. I declare this and I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter. Therefore, the honourable and eminent Minister should believe and be sure, together with Great Britain, that we still remain firm to our resolution which Storrs learnt from us two years ago, for which we await the opportunity suitable to our situation, especially in view of that action the time of which has now come near and which destiny drives towards us with great haste and clearness, so that we and those who are of our opinion, may have reasons for such action against any criticisms or responsibilities imposed upon us in future. Your expression “we do not want to push you to any hasty action which might jeopardise the success of your aim” does not need any more12 explanation except what we may ask for, when necessary, such as arms, ammunition, &amp;c. I deem this sufficient as I have occupied much of your honour’s time. I beg to offer you my great veneration and respect. I hi signed. Dated 25 Safar, 1334. 1st January 1916. 15.—“ Verbal ” Message. (Written unsigned.) 1 . It is unworthy of the greatness of Great Britain to think that we believe false rumours; we know her justice, &amp;c. ike., to her people. 2 . You did well in allowing M. Sherif El Faruki to remain in Egypt; do not let him leave Egypt yet. 3. Money arrived. 4. Have written to the Yemen Zaidis to leave Lahej alone ; also to Somali Mulla. 5. Not one camel of ours is going ; some, have been taken from the Kosseim and Ibn Sand’s district; Sherif might have stopped Ibn Saud, but did not, being informed that he was friend of the British. Will stop him if desired. 6 . 1 have warned Senussi through Idris, but he changed his mind; disapprove of his action and will squeeze his Wakil in Mecca. 16.—Private from Sherif Abdalla to Mr. Storrs. My dear and beloved Mr. Storrs, My father sends you his best greetings and I verily confirm the bonds of my love and old friendship towards you and assure you that I am, indeed, exerting my zeal here as much as possible, as you are doing the same there. (Signed) A. H. Undated. 17.—Communication from Sir 11. McMahon to the Grand Sherif. The Residency, (After customary greetings.) Cairo. YV e have received with great pleasure and satisfaction your letter of the 25th Safar ( 1 st January) at the hands of your trusty messenger, who has also transmitted to us your verbal messages. We fully realize and entirely appreciate the motives which guide you in this important question and we know well that you are acting entirely in the interests of the Arab peoples and with no thought hevond their welfare. W e take note of your remarks concerning the vilayet of Baghdad and will take the question into careful consideration when the enemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlements arrives. As regards the Northern parts we note with satisfaction your desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and 4ranee. It is, as you know, our fixed determination that nothing shall be peinutted to interfere in the slightest degree with our united prosecution of this wai to a victorious conclusion. Moreover, when the victory has been won, the friendship of Great Britain and France will become yet more firm and enduring, cemented by the blood of Englishmen andFrenchmen who have died side by side fighting for the Cause of Right and Liberty. In this great cause Arabia is now associated and God grant that the result of our mutual efforts and co-operation will bind us in a lasting friendship to the mutual welfare and happiness of us all! We are greatly pleased to hear of the action you are taking to win all the Arabs over to our joint cause and to dissuade them from giving any assistance to our enemies, and we leave it to your discretion to seize the most favourable moment for further and more decided measures. You will doubtless inform us by the bearer of this letter of any manner in which we can assist you and your requests will always receive our immediate consideration. You will have heard how El Sayed Ahmed el Sherif el Senussi has been beguiled by evil advice into hostile action, and it will be a great grief to you to know that he has been so far forgetful of the interests of the Arabs as to throw in his lot with our enemies. Misfortune has now overtaken him and we trust that this will show him his error and lead him to peace for the sake of his poor misguided followers. We are sending this letter by the hand of your good messenger, who will also bring to you all our news. With salaams. A. H. McMahon.. 2b Rabi al Awwal. 18.—Communication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to the High Commi ssioner, Cairo. In the name of the Merciful, the Compassionate, to the most noble His Excellency the High Commissioner. • May God protect him. After compliments and respects. We received your Excellency’s letter dated 25 Rabi al Awwal, and its contents filled us with the utmost pleasure and satisfaction at the attainment of the required understanding and the intimacy desired. I ask God to make easy our purposes and prosper our endeavours. Your Excellency will understand the work that is being done, and the reasons for it from the following — Firstly.—We had informed your Excellency that we had sent one of our sons to Syria to command the operations deemed necessary there. We have received a detailed report from him stating that the tyrannies of the Government there have not left of the persons upon whom they could depend, whether of the different ranks of soldiers or of others, save only a few, and those of secondary importance; and that he is awaiting the arrival of the forces announced from different places, especially from the people of the country and the surrounding Arab regions as Aleppo and the south of Mosul, whose total number is calculated at not less than 100,000 by their estimate ; and he intends, if the majority of the forces mentioned are Arab, to begin the movement by them : and, if otherwise, that is, of the lurks or others, he will observe their advance to the canal, and when they begin to fight, his movements upon them will be different to what they expect. Secondly — We purposed sending our eldest son to Medina with sufficient forces to strengthen his brother (who is) in Syria, and with every possibility of occupying the railway line, or carrying out such operations as circum stances may admit. This is the beginning of the principal movement, and we are satisfied m its beginning with what we had levied as guaids to keep the interior of the country quiet; they are of the people of Hijaz only, for manv reasons, which it would take too long to set foith, chiefly the difficulties in the way of providing their necessities with secrecy and speed (although this precaution was not necessary) and to make it easy to bring reinforcements when needed ; this is the summary of what you wished to understand. In my opinion it is sufficient, and it is to be taken as a foundation and a standard as to our actions m the face of all (hanges and unforeseen events which the sequence of events may show. It remains for us to state what we need at present.14 Firstly .—The amount of 50,000 pounds in gold for the monthly pay of the troops levied, and other things the necessity of which needs' no explanation. We beg you to send it with all possible haste. Secondly. —20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 3,000 sacks of barley, 150 sacks of coffee, 150 sacks of sugar, 5,000 rifles of the modern pattern and the necessary ammunition, and 100 boxes of the two sample cartridges (enclosed) and of Martini Henry cartridges and “ Aza,” that is of those of the rifles of the factory of St. Etienne in France for the use of those two kinds of rifles of our tribes, it would not be amiss to send 500 boxes of both kinds. Thirdly.—We think it better that the place of deposit of all these thin«- S should be Port Sudan. Fourthly. —As the above provisions and munitions are not needed until the beginning of the movement (of which we will inform vou officially) they should remain at the above place, and when we need them we will infonn the Governor there of the places to which they may be conveyed and of the in termediaries who will carry orders for receiving them. Fijthhy. The money required should be sent at once to the Governor of Port Sudan, and a confidential agent will be sent by us to receive it either all at once or in two instalments, according as he' is able, and this x) is the (secret) sign to be recognised for accepting the man. Sixthly.—Our envoy who will receive the money shall be sent to Port Sudan in three weeks time, that is to say, he will be there on the Fifth of 1 9th March. -Jamad A wail 1 , with a letter from us ,, , i n?r , . n .. addressed to A1 Khawaga Elias Effendi saying that he (Hlias) will pay him, in accordance with the letter the rent of our properties, and the signature will he clear in our name’ but we will instruct him to ask for the Governor of the place, whom’you will apprise of this person s arrival. After perusal of letter, the money should be given to him on condition that no discussion whatever is to be made with him of any question concerning us. We beg you most emphatically not to tell him anything, keeping this affair secret, and he should be treated apparently as if he were nothing out of the way. Let it not be thought that our appointment of another man results from lack of confidence m bearer; it is only to avoid waste of time for we are appointing him to a task elsewhere. At the same time we beg you not feingt.fficTem, m “ Stea, ' er ' ° r the alrea.l/ai-mnged Seventhly.--Our representative, bearer of the present letter, has been dehmtely instructed to ensure the arrival of this, and ] think tint hk mission this tune is hmshed since the condition of things is known both in oem 1.1 ami m detail, and there is no need for sending anyone else.

Verily 1 am,‘ praise be to God, in good health and spirits, and as you well know of a sincere intention and transparent honesty; and my hope, God willing, is the accomplishment of meeting and converse in the very near future, and have instructed the bearer to inform you of what is necessary. God protect you. Express our best greeting to the noble Commissioner. 14 Rabi al Akhar 1334. Abdalla ibx Hosayn. (18th February.) 2L—Verbal message from the Sherif Abdalla to Mr. Storrs. Thanks and messages. My father is followdng up a policy which requires time, while I work out the practical details by means of a secret council of Arab notables and Islamic dignitaries, the result of which he will soon perceive. We have written certain requests, which v r e hope will be granted without delay or loss of time. 1 request 3,000L for im'self. lie assured that -'verything is going forward excellently, and success is certain. I wish to make the Bedawin work properly and this requires money. 1 desire speedy despatch of letter to Idrisi, the matter being important. 22.—Communication from Sir A. H. McMahon to the Grand Sherif. (After customary greetings.) We have received your letter of the 14th Rabi al Akhar (18th February), duly delivered by your trusted messenger. We are grateful to note the active measures which you propose to take. We consider them the most suitable in the existing circumstances, and they have the approval of His Majesty’s Government. I am pleased to be able to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have approved of meeting your requests, and that which you asked to be sent with all haste is beino- despatched with your messenger, who is also the bearer of this letter. 1 This alludes to a verbal message sent to him on the occasion of the last visit of his messenger, informing him that his personal property in Egypt was being well looked after.16 The remainder wdl be collected as quickly as possible, and will be deposited at Port Sudan, where it will remain until we hear from you officially of the beginning of the movement and of the places to which they may be'conveyed, and the intermediaries who will carry out the orders for receiving them. The necessary instructions, as set forth in your letter, have been issued to the Governor at Port Sudan, and he will arrange everything in accordance with your wishes. Your representative who brought your last letter has been duly facilitated in his journey to Jeizan, and every assistance has been given him in his mission, which we trust will be crowned with good results. We have arranged that, on completion, he will be brought to Port Sudan, whence he will proceed by safest means to join you, and report the results of his work. We take the opportunity, in sending this letter, to explain to you a matter which otherwise might not have been clear to you, and which might have given rise to misunderstanding. There are various Turkish posts and small garrisons along the coasts of Arabia who are hostile to us, and who are said to be p 1 aiming injury to cur naval interests in the Red Sea. We may, therefore, find it necessary to take hostile measures against these posts and garrisons, but we have issued strict instructions that every care must be taken by our ships to differentiate between the hostile Turkish garrisons and the innocent Arab inhabitants, towards whom we entertain such friendly feelings. We give you notice of this matter in case distorted and false reports may reach you of the reasons for any action which we may be obliged to take. W r e have heard rumours that our mutual enemies are endeavouring to construct boats for the purpose of laying mines in the Red Sea, and of other wise injuring our interests there, and we beg of you that .you will give us early information should you receive any confirmation of such reports. We have heard that Ibn Rashid has been selling large quantities of camels to the Turks, which are being sent up to Damascus. We hope that you will be able to use your influence with him in order that he may cease this practice, and, if he still persists, that you will be able to arrange for the Arabs who lie between him and Syria to seize the camels as they pass—a procedure which will be to our mutual advantage. 1 am glad to be able to inform you that those misguided Arabs under Sayed Ahmed el Senussi, who have fallen victims to the wiles of Turkish and German intriguers, are now beginning to ste the error of their ways and are coming in to us in large numbers, asking for forgiveness and friendship. We have severely defeated the forces which these intriguers had collected against us, and the eyes of the Arabs are now becoming open to the deceit which has been practised upon them. The capture oi Erzerum and the defeats sustained by the Turks in the Caucasus are having a great effect in our favour, and are greatly helping the cause for which we are both working. W e ask God to prosper your endeavours and to further the work which you have taken in hand. Li conclusion, we beg you to accept our warmest salutations and expressions of friendship. (Signed) A. H.

Chief Political Officer. 9~w Relations between Ibn Sa'ud and th e 'Aimi and the recent history of the latter. * , r‘| 'ijM* towards Ibn Sa'ud, with whon they were fornerly on good terns,appears to date from the expulsion of the Turks from the Hasa and the extension of Ibn Sa'ud's authority over that province,which is the headquarters of the 'AinTan tribe. Ibn Sa’u'd stopped then fronts taking the black nail which they used to exact^ m the tine c£ the Turks on those who passed through their country, and he also attempted to put a poll tax upon them. Ibn Sa'ud expM ned in 1915 that their revolt against him was due to the fact that they were pro-Turk and that Ibn Rashid had bribed them with Turkish money, but Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait was of opinion that there was no evidence to support either of these statements. The 'Ajman found allies in a rebellious section of Ibn Sa’ud’s own house, the 'Araif whose entity with the Hakim of Najd was an old family matter. In 1914 a half-hearted attempt was made to settle it through Shaikh 'Isa ibn Ali of Bahrain, but negotiations were broken off by the ’Araif who said that Sh Shaikh 'Tsa was favouring Ibn Sa'ud. In June 1915 it was repo- ted from Bahrain that Ibn Sa'ud had arrived in t he Hasa and was collecting men to fight the 'Ajman. He was pressed for money and had borrowed fron Shaikh Isa* In a letter to the Political Agent at Bhhrain dated July 8, Ibn Sa'ud complained that Ilandan ibn Zaid al Kbalifah, Shaikh of Abu Dhabi w«S* harbouring and Helping the ’Araif ( who intedded to join the 'Ajman against him. He said that his friendship with us was the reason for2&gt;f ‘-St) the covert hostility of Hae dan ibn Zaid, a statement * ich Shaikh Mubarak pronounced to be without founi ation. Ibn Sa'ud was however correct in his anxiety about the , Araif / who joined forces with the ’Ajman. He appealed to the Shaikh of Kuwait for assistance, but before it eould reach him, he attacked the 'Ajmah by night at Gunzan, SO miles W. of Hofuf and was repulsed with lossy 1 is brother Sa’«d being among the slain- 'Abdul Aziz himself was slightly wounded. The 'Ajman and the 'Araif had on their part asked Mubarak for his help, but he advised the ’Araif to come to terms with Ibn Sa'ud. On hearing of the defeat at Gunzan he sent injunctions to his son Shaikh Salim who was in command of the troops intended to help Ibn Sa'ild, bidding him to proceed,but not to give Ibn Sa'ud active support unless he obeyed the ms- instructions with regard to militaryk strategy which Shi kh Mubarak had given him by letter. The Ajman failed to enlist support either from Mubarak,or from Shaikh 'Isa, who advised them to make peace with Ibn Sa'ud, or from Shaikh 'Abdullah ibn Than i of Qatau,who told them he could do nothing for them as he was a frisnd ^ of Ibn Sa, ud* Nevertheless Ibn Sa’iTd was hard pressed until the arrival of Shaikh Salim. He applied to Shaikh 'Isa for ammunition, the despatch of which was facilitated by us. In August we sttzed in B* rain eome cases of ammunition which were being sent from Abu Dhabi to the ’Ajman. At that time the 'Ajman had the run of the Hasa , they held all the roads,and Ibn Sa'ud was practi cally a prisoner in HofGf. The arrival of Shikh Salim^ changed the balance in Ibn Sard's favour and the 'Ajman were thoroughly beaten on September 24, 1915. Further in a fight between them and the Bani Kbilid, Fahad al ’Araif was killed,and Sulaiaan al ’Araif was obliged to take refugewith Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh of Abu Dhi i.vent still further in hostility to Ibn Sa’ud by urging the Al Morrah to revolt against him. (They w ere not put down by Ibn Sa’ud till the sumer of 1916.) The two 'AjmaB Shaikhs who had been operating against Ibn Sa'ud, Dhaida'n ibn Hithlain (the Hithlam^ are the ruling family of the tribe) and Khumaiyis ibn Munaikhir of the Sifran Section,fled no*tb and in Novem ber approached Shjikh Salim with peace proposals. He re plied that they must apply to Shaikh Mubarak and or to Ibn Sa’Sd, whereupon Dhaiden caneto Kuwait and made sub mission, which was accepted on a promise of future good behaviour. Two days later messages arrived from Ibn San Sa’ud asking Mubarak not to treat with tie Ajman. It was too late to consider the request, but m all probability it would not have been entertained,jis Ibn Sa'ud was said to be so bitter against the 'Ajman that he would put to death all who fell into his hands. The nronisees of the ’Ajnan to Mubarak included an undertaking to submit to the authority of Ibn Sa’ud in al Hasa where most of the'Ajman live. After Shaikh Mubarak’s death in December 1915, the admission of the‘Ajman to Kuwait seemed likely to prove a difficulty to his successor. Shaikh Jabir could not control Ibn Sa-u'd as his father had done; he did not wish to be on bad terms with them but feared/f he ejected the 'Ajman, that they would join Ibn Rashid and give trouble in Kuwait territory. He wrote clearly ^d reason- S ab ly to Ibn Sa'ud on the matter. But in February 1916 Ibn Sa'ud insisted that they should be ejected^which was accordingly done. As was expcted thqy joined first Ajaimi then Ibn Rashid, .uni 'ftjrnmi, } Shaikh Dhaidan wrote to the ’’Commander of the Turkish Army' saying they were at his disposal. They were notallowed to cone to Kuwait or obtain supplies and as they plundered sone Kuwait Canels cT'd Kuwait Territory an a,dc.i“ tional source of en^nity arose. In May 1916 they asked and obtained the acquiescence of the Shaikh of Zubair to settle at Safwan. But when in the following month, Ibn Rashid summoned then to come to his aid against Hfcnud ibn Suwait and Dhari ibn TawSlah, some iknxMM 300 of them responded and left without giving notice to Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair. The day after their departure they sent him a verbal message saying that their intentions were not hostile to the British. This action and communication he justly considered to be un- reasonable. Shaikh Dhaidan is still with Ibn Rashid (July 2l) but lack of provisions has caused most of the 'Ajnan to returns to Safv/an. The members of the tribe who took refuge at kawait after being defeated and routed by Bin Saud m September 1915, belonged to the following eleven main Sections: A1 Hitman Al Ma'fdh A1 Suledman Al Dhain Al Misra &lt; Al Sifran Al MahfudhM In all they numbered just over 2000 fighting men. (ii) When they were expelled from Kuwait only about §-of the above went north i.e. about 1400. These were composed of all the 7 divisions. The remainder apja rently split33^ Tfcere aI * e probably between two and three^^n^io^ed^witn either Khunaiyis ( '.ith ^iiwnimr bin tiAnaikhir^Dhaidan, or Metalegin. -The remainder of the 1200 vdiioh joined Ajaimi drifted away south. Sultan al Hithlain has a family connexion through his mother with Kuwait; and this may have had something to do with the liao* to Safwan in the f irst instance. J.G.t 2747 i &lt;--• i ft II From General, Basra, $th July 1916. (Repeated Foreign, Simla-, Chief of General Staff, Simla; and Cairo.) LG. 3228, dated 9th July 1916. Your telegram of 30th June. Firstly.—Suggested reconciliation between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid. At meeting with Bin Saud in January, Chief Political Officer explained to him that it would be helpful to British policy if he became reconciled with Bin Rashid and won him over to our side. If Bin Rashid made overtures as he was expected probably to do, Bin Rashid (? Saud) then intended encouragement of them. Things shaped otherwise, however. Shortly after Bin Sand’s return to Riyadh he was called south again to punish the A1 Morra while Bin Rashid moved up towards Nasiriyah. Latter’s intentions and attitude were from the first doubtful, but he showed no inclination to be unfriendly and so was treated with utmost patience and allowed obtain necessaries from our towns until he finally stated to Chief Political Officer’s emissary that he was here by instructions and in payment of Turks and would certainly join them in attacking us il the Turks sent troops to support him. On receipt of this frank declaration, the Russlam section of the Shammar and the Dhalir, who are in our pay, were encouraged to oppose him and clear him out. They came in contact with him on 28th June near Khamsieh, and, supported by a squadron of our cavalry, routed him and captured some 400 of his camels and killed 15 oi 20 men Meanwhile, reports have been received that Bin^ Sand’s son and brother are operating against the Shamar near Hail with considerable success, and on the other hand, that Bin Rashid has received a telegram from Constantinople calling upon him to return to Hail and await Turkish support. . , . . . . , , It is expected that this summons, combined with the knock recently administered to him, will send him back to Hail, but at piesent moment he is within few miles of Khamsieh. It is possible, however, that the active hostility of ? Shammar and Dhalir, and difficulty he now finds in feeding himself may induce him to make overtures to us, but this is hardly likely. He has only small following and very little prestige, and unless he is joined by other tribes, is of little military signif^ppeew L Secondly.—Effect of Sherif’s action. Minds]^ movement slowihere, and it is earlv yet to gauge its full effect, the news created no paiticulai stii, and large majority of the inhabitants are too ill-inforhied to appreciate its significance, and many are disinclined to ciedit it. Ihe actively pio-1 uikish element, of which a number of former kurkish employees form the nucleus, regret it and consider that it is unfair of Sherif to rebel and raise question of Arab independence while lurkey was in, throes of wai. Intelligent Shiah Arabs with little more liking for British than for the Turks, appear to be pleased at news, and affect to hope that Sherif’s declaration will be extended to Iraq. The small sprinkling of enlightened Sunni Arabs, including a few individuals of Arab nationalist tendencies now here, are of course delighted, and among these the chief Arab resident of Basra, after the Naikib, on being acquainted with Reuter’s communique by Chief Political Officer, at once remarked spontaneously, “ What the Sherd ought to do now is to declare himself Calif, everyone would welcome it. ^ Ihe recent incidents at Kerbela will of course create greater stir m Persia than in Iraq Here the majority of Shiah, who as a class aie strong]\ anti-l ersian, discount the sio-nificance of the occurrences and regard them as phase of the time-honoured^feud between Holy Places and the Turkish Government. The minority regard Kerbela incidents with indignation, and make them a specific reason for welcoming Sherif’s action and hoping for its extension to Iraq. ^ iin the Foreign end Political Department, Delhi* Uo*1170-B., dated the 16th freed. 17th) March 1916.

On 22nd January Army Commander who only had about 500 available here expressed ability to give him 2 mountain guns and 500 rifles, and Bin Baud was then asked to have party sent here to be trained in gunnery. Meanwhile Hawam arr/ived and the Z guns and 400 rifles reserved for Bin Baud v/ere given to Kav/am owing to urgency of his case. Two more guns can probably be made serviceable* Meanwhile Bin Baud asks urgently for an instalment of rifles. Hawam has now left Lingah. Rifles sent with Sykes will in any case have to go on by instalments as Hawam is able to arrange for transport. I would propose that 1,000 of these rifles and 200,000 rounds be deflected and sent to Bahrein for Bin Baud, to be repliced later if necessity nhx should arise.

Your writings and the publications which you say you sent me have not, however, arrived. Indeed, most honoured and learned Sir, you advise and exhort us with sincerity because of your zeal for Islam and your jealousy for our religion and for Arab honour, which you display towards us and our country, persevering in the cause of Islam. Let us be on our guard and beware of the evil results of the snares of politics and the Foreign intrigues and political adventures of which you are aware. Now we, as I told your honour in my former letter, do not hesitate either in w r ord or in deed about adopting all necessary preventive measures to lock against foreign interference the doors which are open on all sides; nor do w r e spare effort, or exertion in making our preparations for protecting that part winch is within the sphere of our control and without it in the Jazirat-al-Arab* against the machinations of our enemies which are worked from without; and moreover w r e do willingly what we can for its advancement and prosperity. And in this important matter you tell us that you have made a comprehensive and detailed arrangement, and you desire above all things the acquiescence of the officers who are in charge of its execution ; and you tell us that there are certain persons who offer themselves for our service, and that they will come to us and that their presence is essential to us, and you say that you do not know what conditions they will impose, but that we must accept them. Yet, Honoured Master, we do not understand the arrangements which you have made, and we are afraid and are on our guard lest they should not be adapted to present conditions and to our traditionary arrangements which we. follow in our Kingdom which is the Strong Bope of God. What are these men, and what do they want, and to what Society do they belong ? And what is the number of the forces required to put into execution this important plan ? It is reasonable to consent and communicate our reply before receiving full information. I feel the same confidence as I do in the very fact of my exis tence, and your honour will kindly forgive me, since you know (and so does everyone) all about us, our plans, our hopes and our aims, and how steadfast we will be in the prosecution of this scheme, which we do not understand. Our actions will be for the sake of our deliverance, and accordingly we shall remain in the expectation of getting full information.

I have the honour to forward, with translations, a letter, with en closures, from BinSaud to His Excellency the Viceroy, in reply to his letter of 26th August. 2. I much regret its belated despatch. A translation was sent to me while at Kut, and I was under the impression, until I dealt with the file on my return, that the original had gone on to its destination. Translation of a letter, dated 6th Zilhijjah 1333 [ — 16th October 1915), from Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman al Faisal to His Excellency Lord llardinge of Penshurst, Viceroy and Governor-General of India. I have received your highly esteemed letter dated the 14th Shawal 1333 (26th August 1915) with an Arabic translation, through the friend of all, His Honour Colonel Cox. I took it with respectful hands and was honoured by its perusal and I duly understood what you have informed me, specially with regard to your expression of pleasure at realising the friendship and sincere intentions that I hold, from the bottom of my faithful heart, towards His Majesty the King- Emperor. May his glory ever increase, and for the British Government and the Government of India. Your pleasure is only an august sign of your lofty character and high dignity, I accordingly express my thanks and grateful ness for the sincere regard that you have expressed for myself. As regards the matter of Bin Bashid, as I informed Your Excellency, in the interest of both parlies, I had offered to him the necessary advice so that he might follow it and behave in an amicable manner, as I do, and should not act against the British Government, as is required in the interests of both parties. He sent me an agreement purporting to accept my advice and offering assurances of peace, and saying that he will join hands with me in becoming allied to each other and to my friend the British Government. He actually gave me a written assurance to that effect as you will see from the true copy enclosed herewith. When I reached Hasa, in connection with the punishment of the mischief- makers about whose evil works and misbehaviour, I informed our friend Sir Percy Cox, who must have reported to you my affairs of the past. The Turkish Government sent to Bin Bashid an officer who went to him and wrote to me a letter asking for a meeting with me. The purpose of his letter was to come to an agreement with me on some important points concerning the Turks. I, however, replied that I had no intention in that direction and I was opposed to his object and wanted to keep aloof from Turkish affairs. ^ On receiving my letter he was convinced that I was opposed to his motive. I preferred to return the said Envoy’s letter to the said Bin Bashid. The latter was then pressed to break his agreement with me; they also sent out intriguers to the rebellious Ajman tribe. Thus, at the instance of the said person, Bin Bashid broke the treaty treacherously, but thank God, my well-organised forces at Qasim under the command of my Amirs repulsed him with great loss. By the Grace of God he is now in a very degraded and depressed condition. About the question of Turkey. She is importuning the Arabs and tribes and inducing them to co-operate by paying large sums of money, but no doubt, by God’s help, it will not be of any use to them at all. The wise men are bound to me and follow my policy and as regards those who are opposed (to us) the evil consequences of their own actions will be their disgrace. Having confidence in and friendship with the High Government I explain to them all the affairs, as I am bound to them very closely against all their enemies.

From—The Hon^blb Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.SX, K.C.I.E., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, To a he Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, In continuation of my telegram No, 3500, dated the 27th December 1915, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of Government, the text of the Treaty with Bin Saud, as signed by himself and me in original; together with the following papers:— (i) Translation of Treaty as signed. (w) j&gt; side by side with British draft, for facility of com parison. (m) Comment on the wording of the Articles, as signed. (iv) Translation of letter from myself to Bin Saud pointing out a clerical omission in the Arabic saying that I was correcting the original before submission to Government, and asking him to correct his copy. 2. The last enclosure explains itself. I much regret that this clerical error should have occurred and that it should have escaped notice alike by the scribe, and by Bin Saud and myself. I should explain that I had not detected it when I despatched my telegram above quoted, I can only plead in pallia tion the difficult conditions of light and expedition under which the documents were faired, read and compared. There can be no doubt that Bin Sand will endorse the correction, and assuming that to be the case, I trust the text of Treaty will appear to Government sufficiently satisfactory to justify its acceptance and ratification. Had Bin Saud been able to remain another day and thus give me a second seance, it might have been possible to manoeuvre him closer to the text of the British draft. On the other hand, it is also possible that had he not been anxious to conclude the business at one sitting, he might have been less ready than he was to meet me half way in regard to points of difference. 3. I am dealing in a separate communication with Bin Saud’s position generally and with what passed'at my meeting with him at Darein near Katif on 26th December. Ik A/ i , 1 \ Enclo. No. 1.

Comment on wording of Treaty as signed'by Bin Saud. ^ With reference to my previous note of June 26th forming enclosure to my letter No. 1318-B., dated 16th June 1915. PREAMBLE. 1. Addition of words *' Jubail and the towns and ports belonging to them In reply to my observation that we recognised Jubail as being within the Hasa Sanjak, w r nat need therefore was there to make specific mention of the place, Bin feaud explained that it was the locality where his limits on the coast approached those claimed by Kuwait, and for that reason he would like to have the place specified. It is well outside the boundary accepted by us for Kuwait, in our negotiations with the Turks, so I saw no objection to accepting its mention here, with the words following. j 2. “ For a long time ” instead of &lt;£ for generations Accepted without discussed and determined hereafter ”. Accepted for same reasons as stated under (1) above. . I- Change of word c&lt; countries ” for &lt;f territory ” or “ limits ”. Accepted as desired by him, as being unobjectionable. 5. Addition of words “and absolute Chief of their tribes Bin Saud was anxious for its retention and it is a difficult point to argue; so I did not press for its omission. 6. (a) The words “designation of his successor” (by the living Euler). The word translated “designation” was “tansib” in Bin Saud’s draft. The word cc tansib ” as used and spelt by him was of dubious meaning and accuracy, so in agreement with him it was changed with his concurrence to “ taa’in ” about which there is no ambiguity. ' I made sure that the English rendering conveyed the meaning intended by him. {b) “or by the calling for the votes of the subjects inhabiting the countries”. We discussed the possibility of doing this in practice and the question of whether the course suggested could be regarded as an ordinary method of deciding a succession. We both came to the conclusion that it was not a practicable proposal and had better be abandoned. 7. I could not get Bin Saud to accept the condition of British approval as worded by us. I pointed out to him that in the absence of such a clause we might perhaps find ourselves committed to support an incompetent son, designated because he was his father’s favourite, although perhaps unpalatable to the tribes or unfriendly in his feelings towards us. His reply was that in practice it would not be possible for the Euler to appoint an individual or for the latter to make good his succession unless he enjoyed the confidence of the tribes and was capable of controlling them. As a matter of fact there being no third party to this Treaty the inter- pretatioD of it rests with us and we should not in practice accord recognition to anyone wffiom we did disapprove, nor would he be able to last, without our recognition. I trust the proviso inserted will be considered sufficient to pro tect our interests. 8. The question of “ unprovoked ” aggression. He repeated the argu ment that the word “taadi” in itself suggested absence of justification, but that in any case he could hardly agree to the insertion of the word “ unprovok ed ” because we should be able to take refuge behind it in order not to afford him assistance, if at any time it was inconvenient for us to do so. He continued that it was certain that there would be no intentional aggression by Article flf.him on any Foreign Power. The compromise arrived at in the wording, as accepted, seems to be a fair one. 9. He expressed opinion that our first wording with reference to the extent of aid to be given was too one-sided, but he readily agreed to the alter native which was accordingly adopted. 9. (a) Addition of words “and countries”. The protection of his countries must, 1 think, be considered as included in the protection of his interests—as his main interest in fact, I therefore saw no objection to the addition of the words, as he desired them. Article IV. Items 10, 11, 12 and 13 call for no comment. 14. “Where his interests require it”. Bin Saud did not like the unqualified undertaking to accept our advice ; and the alternative pro vision was covered by the discretion given me. In regard to this article however I would offer the following observations. In the British Draft the tc advice ” referred to seems only to mean advice in regard to the cession of territory dealt with in the Article; but as it came in the Arabic, Bin Saud seemed to regard the undertaking as a general one. There are of course no stops in the Arabic, so that it is open to either construc tion, and I would therefore suggest that in the English version, of which he has asked for a copy, we should have a full stop and new paragraph after the words “ British Government This punctuation makes Bin Sand’s under taking not to cede, without our consent, an absolute one, as I believe he means it to be, and in addition gives us a general undertaking from him to follow our advice, when we find it necessary to give it him, unreservedly so long as it is not damaging to his own interests. Article V. 15 and 16. The wording has been improved somewhat; the meaning is the same as before. Article VI. 17. Omission of words “other Chiefs and tribes”. He said he had merely omitted these words as the several Chiefs whom we did protect and had relations with were all mentioned, so that the words in question seemed unnecessary ; it was difficult to justify the retention of the words as providing for future requirements^ without arguing possible cases in point. This it was difficult to do, so I did not press for their restoration. 18. His wording accepted. 19. He pointed out that some of the matters such as boundaries were among those already alluded to in the present treaty, so there seemed no need to say other matters. The point seemed of no importance, so 1 did not press it. P. Z. COX, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Lesident in the Persian Gulf. Enclo. No. 4. Translation. Dated the 27th December 1915.

I trust you were able to start from Darein this morning as was your intention when we separated last night. It 1 be f 1 ame necessary for me to write and explain to you that on going rough the original of the signed Treaty again carefully with a view to1 7 * submitting it; to Government for ratification, I find that in spite of the care w &lt; ? 1 Y e boti \ to check the Arabic, one clerical error has been made “ i 1 ,i “ ™**&gt;■' — »«“• ?»£ The omission has occurred in Article 4. is as follows^—^ aS Wr0ngly worded in the signed document above mentioned, Bin Sand hereby undertakes that he will absolutely not cede, sell, mort gage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the above territories or any part of them or grant concessions within those to any Foreign Power, without the consent 0t ^ ^ overil ment; and that he will follow her advice unreservedlv provided tha^ it be not damaging to his own interests This Article as accepted by Your Honour before our meeting and as worded m our final draft was as follows :— Bin Saud hereby undertakes that he will absolutely not cede, sell, mortgage lease, or otherwise^ dispose of the above territories or any part of them, or grant concessions within those territories to any Foreign Power or lo the subjects of any Foreign Fower without the consent of the British Government, and that he will follow their advice unreservedly provided that it be not damaging to his own interests From this you will see that the words (i or to the subjects of any Foreign Power were omitted by mistake of the writer in the document signed by us. I have duly written them in the text of the original document which I am submitting to Government, and Government will consider it in this form; so that if the same mistake occurs in the copy with you, I trust you will add the words above quoted. I shall send you shortly the perfect version with an English translation, as you asked me. I confidently hope that from the conclusion of this Treaty with the British Government your affairs will be blessed with increased prosperity and good fortune. Before closing let me offer you my best thanks for your friendly welcome and assure you again of my friendship and my sympathy for the promotion of your interests.
