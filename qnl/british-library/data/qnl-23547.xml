Dear Sir, The incroasinc* number of encjuirios for our EXectricol household and other appliances calls for a review in dealing with these satisfactorily* Consequently, we are seriously considering appointing a sole agent for a specified area, who could, on a part-time basis, handle these enquiries efficiently on our behalf and at the same time promote new business locally. In support of such an agency, we have in mind paying a small nominal sum to help towards overhead expenses, pay cost of postage and cables sent to us and grant a commission of 5^ on all sales* direct or indirect, subject to such sales being properly completed and paid for. We may need more than one agent in your territory as our range of products covers different typ 0G of clients - lor oxamplo;- Electric Fires, Irons, Kettles, Fans, Heating Pads, Immersion Heaters, Toasters, Hair-Dryers, Large Hood Hair-Dryers, Permanent Hair W ving Machines, Washine Machines, supplied to Stores, Hotels, Slectric Supply Companies, Hairdressing and Beauty Parlours. Perhaps your market Is limited so that one good agent can take care of all the possible clientele. On the other hand, if possible and the area is large, it is desirable to appoint one agent for a limited area and so cover the ground adequately. Appointment of an agent requires careful consideration. He must bo ^nest, hardworking, conscientious and have a well-established connection. Before we decide on an appointment, we should like your recommendation also a letter of application from the prospective agent, detailing his qualifications, references and connections. It would bo of considerable assistance if you could examine and assist us in this matter. Please charge us for any expense involved. Possibly you know wo represent 12 British Producers, employing several thousand employees in numerous British factories. Although our order Book is reasonably full, we anticipate increasing production and perhaps greater foreign competition. Our policy is, therefore, based on long term trading conditions, and we shall need to consolidate our specialities in your market Wo might add that we are recoiving repoatod applications for agencies, but are dubious of making any chance appointment, particularly as we have already experienced a few disappointments through haphazard decisions. Wo h^vo also plenty of literature to assist towards sale of our products. Probably you may have soon our goods in your territory already. Thanking you in anticipation.

In the Trade Report for 1942—194^5 which you have so kindly sent me I cannot trace any.item for ^ Wines and Spirits in the list of imports. Is this due to any restrictions on the importation and sale of spirits and spirituous compounds in the Protectorate, or do these articles oome under the heading of wMiscellaneous Provisions' ? I am interested in the export and sale of wines and spirits produced in Cyprus, and It has been suggested to me that Bahrain would be a good market offering great possibilities for the sale of thete products in view of the advent of large numbers of Europeans. Your remarks concerning hotel or rest house accommodation are somewhat disconcerting, but as I am single with no encumbrances and physically quite fit I am prepared to take the risk. In these olrcumstances I hope that it may be possible for you to grant me a visa, especially as it is my Intention to return to England shortly and if the prospects are sufficiently tempting I will proceed to Bahrain early next year.
