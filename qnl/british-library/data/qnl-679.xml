Foreign Secret. Colonel Shakespear, now Political Agent, Koweit, who is proceeding on leave early in January, has asked for permission to attempt a journey through Central Arabia to the Red Sea. He has received an invitation from Bin Sand, who is a personal friend, to visit him at Riadh, and proposes to proceed thence in the direction of Hail. Shakespear, who has long been preparing himself for such a journey, knows Arabic well, is personally acquainted with tribes as far as Nejd, and is thus exceptionally well qualified to undertake a tour of this description. There is at present peace amongst tribes on his proposed route, and we trust it may be possible, if the political situation allows, to grant him permission. His exploration would be most useful, both from military, political, and geographical points of view. Possibly recent announcement that the Porte had decided to recognise Bin Sand as Mutessarif of Nejd will enable journey to be made without offending Turkish susceptibilities or arousing suspicion. It will be unfortunate if, for political reasons, Englishmen are always to be excluded from exploration in Central Arabia while field is left open for foreigners.To No. 112 of 1912. VERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. Secret EXTERNAL. The Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 10th October 1912, My Lord Marquis, With reference to Your Lordship’s Secret despatch, No. 27, dated the 19th July 1912, on the subject of the recent journey of the Danish traveller Herr Barclay Raunkiaer in Central Arabia, we have the honour to report that, as desired, we have instructed the Political Resident iu the Persian Gulf to communicate to the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain the thanks of tho Royal Danish Geographical Society for the services rendered by them to Herr Raunkiaer. 2. With regard to the last paragraph of the despatch cited, we enclose, • Letter Ko. 2085 (Cenfi,!.ntu), datea tho 7th lor Ypur Lo.dship’s information, copy of September 191 a, with enclosures. a communication* from Sir Percy Cox explaining the nature of the assistance rendered to Herr Raunkiaer by Captain Shakespear and Captain Lorimer. The latter was not in any way associated with Herr Raunkiaer’s travels, and he merely befriended the traveller on his arrival at Bahrain in a dilapidated condition on the completion of his journey. As regards Captain Shakespear, he received the warning too late, as Herr Raunkiaer had already left Kuwait on the 2 Uh February 1912 before our telegram, oa ed the 1st March 1912, which was addressed to Bushire reached Captain Shakespear. In the circumstances and for the reasons stated in Sir Percy Cox’s letter, we agree that Captain Shakespear was justified in acting as he did, and trust that Your Lordship will concur in that view.

As regards Kuwait, the position was this.

Knowing nothing further I contented myself with remarking to the Shaikh that the desert roads were probably too unsafe for M. Raunkiaer’s project. 3. A day or t^vo later M. Raunkiaer called on me and in the course of that call and several subsequent ones I was convinced that he had neither political motives of his own nor was travelling secretly on Turkish or German behalf. He gave his opinions freely on the Baghdad Railway, along the route of which he had travelled and expre sed equal contempt for Turkish diplomacy in granting the concession and general ideas of its ever becoming a paying concern. He was very frank as to his owm antecedents and ambitions in the exploration of Arabia, told me how a proposed expedition in company wbth a Danish officer from the south of Arabia (Marbat in Dhufar) into the hinterland of Oman had to be abandoned, how he had volunteered for an expedition to Hofhof as the Danish Geographical Society had the money available, and how he hoped by undertaking it to qualify himself for any other exploration in Arabia which might be proposed in the future. In short he convinced me that he was no more than he purported to be and gave me the impression of a very young and enterprising man, keenly desirous of making a name for himself as an explorer, but very badly equipped for and ignorant of the perils of the task. I saw some of his maping and its crudity certainly supported his statement that he was less topographer than botanist. 4. Having arrived at this conclusion when the Shaikh again mentioned M. Raunkiaer, I said at once that so far as 1 could ascertain he was a genuine traveller with no political aims. The Shaikh then said that the route to Hofhof was impossible owing to the Ajman tribe’s unsettled state and as M. Raunkiaer was indifferent what unexplored route into Arabia he followed so long as he did not have to leave Kuwait by sea he might with safety accompany a caravan to Buraidaand thence via Anazeh and Riadh reach Hofhof and Bahrein. 5. Therefore, when M. Raunkiaer had made his arrangements with a Zilfi camelman for his transport and the contracts were brought to me by both parties or record and attestation i had no hesitation in complying with the request. Shaikh Mobarak furnished him with letters to the Headmen of Buraida and other towns of Nejd and I gave him a letter to Abdul Aziz “BinSaud” to ensure his freedom from molestation and possible danger among the tribes. M. Raunkiaer started on the 24th February, leaving behind a box which he begged might be sent to the care of the Political Agent, Bahrein, to await his arrival. u/r -d ‘ l'. 18 ^tT^able that the objection of the Government of India to ffi Raunklaer s P ro J ect ( could not reach me earlier, for it would not have been 1 cult to put such obstacles in his way as to make the trip impossible, but the first intimation 1 had that M.

I had a visit to-day from Admiral de Richelieu, President of the Royal Danish Geographical Society, who asked, that the thanks of the Society might, if possible, he conveyed to Captain Shakespear. His Majesty's Political Agent at Koweit, and Cap .ain Lorirner, His Majesty's Political Agent at Bahrein, foi the great assistance they had rendered to Mr. Barclay Raunkiaer in his travels. Indeed, Admiral de Richelieu said that, had it not been for the courtesy and kindness of these officers, Mr. Raunkiaer would not have been able to accomplish his mission. I understand that Mr. Raunkiaer will commu nicate Geographical Society thip autumn. Yours ever (Signed) Conyngham Greene.(p. ?3j. 7.' No information lias been received here of any rescindment of the order nnder which British officers are precluded from visiting Mesopotamia without the special permission of His Britannic Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless British officers continue to arrive here on leave, and I generally know nothing of their presence in the country until they have left Basrah for Baghdad. If it is desired to prevent unauthorised visits, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah might be empowered to require officers not furnished with regular permission to return from that place. During April, Major A. Hewlett of the Central India Horse (from Bushehr) and Mr. H. G. Gauntlett of the York and Lancaster Regiment (from India) were in this country. Neither was aware of having transgressed any regulation. The former only visited Babylon, but the latter made a tour to Musal. Major Hore- prohibition. Personally I do not think that short visits by British officers to recognised places of interests—such as Baghdad, Babylon, the Hindiyah Barrage and Karbala—are now likely to do harm ; but long tours by them off the beaten track certainly cause suspicion and comment. * See V, 15 above.

WITH reference to your despatches Nos. 4 and 7 of the 3rd and 10th ultimo respectively, on the subject of Mr. Barclay Raunkiaer’s journey of exploration in Eastern Arabia, I have the honour to report that according to to-day’s newspapers a telegram has been received from that gentleman, dated Muscat, yesterday, in which he informs the committee of the Royal Danish Geographical Society that he has travelled through Central Arabia, and that, although he had had to contend with great difficulties and even dangers, yet his journey had been successful both in respect of the \ route explored and of' the results achieved. According to the information now published, Mr. Raunkiaer, who left here on the 12th November last, travelled via Constantinople and Asia Minor to Aleppo, whence he proceeded by carriage to Bagdad and Bussorah. With the assistance of the Yali of Bussorah he continued his journey via Zobeir to Koweit, where he was the guest of* the Sheikh Mobarek. At Koweit he drew up the route of his great journey of exploration, which was to cress the desert by way of the Oases of Bereida and Iliad through the heart of Central Arabia in the Wahabite country, and thence eastward by the Oasis of Hoful to the coast. . Mr. Raunkiaer is now on his way to Bombay, en route back to Copenhagen, where he expects to arrive next month. In the autumn the results of his expedition, which include the mapping of a considerable extent of hitherto unexplored country and the study of the inhabitants, the fauna, and flora of the districts traversed, will be published j by the Royal Geographical Society.

Sir, Copenhagen, November 15, 1911. ON the receipt of your despatch No. 13 of the 11th July last I did not fail to inform the Danish Government that Flis Majesty’s Government could not afford facilities for a Danish geographical expedition to explore the lands bordering on the Persian Gnlf. This decision was not, of course, very agreeable to the Royal Danish Geographical Society, who had collected a fund for the object in question, and had, moreover, published a programme of the proposed expedition. There has been some discussion in the newspapers in consequence, which blame the society for having- declared their intentions before they had made sure that they could be carried out, and for having thereby interfered with the prospects of Lieutenant Davidsen and M. Raunkiaer, who were to have led the expedition. The upshot of the whole affair now is that it is announced that Lieutenant Davidsen has retired form the army and is about to proceed to Egypt on his own account, whence he proposes, after a couple of years’ preparation and study of the Arabic language, to penetrate across the desert and explore Arabia. M. Raunkiaer, on the other hand, started on the 12th instant for Bussorah, via Constantinople, Aleppo, and the Euphrates Valley, where he proposes to carry out meteorological, ethnographical, topographical, and botanical researches in the neighbourhood. It is announced that the Ottoman Oovernment have given their consent to the dispatch of the latter expedition, which will be absent about six months. I have the honour to enclose translation of extracts from the “Riget” and “Politiken ” recording interviews with Lieutenant Davidsen and Admiral de Richelieu, president of the Royal Geographical Society, and giving details as to the objects and scope of the two expeditions.''

In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government, to their great regret, find themselves unable to accord any facilities to the Danish explorers or offer them any protection. I am, &amp;c. E.

Mr. Secretary of State, Danish Legation, London, June 15, 1911. THE Royal Danish Geographical Society, an old and well-known institution, having His Majesty the King of Denmark for its high protector and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince for its president, is desirous of sending a small scientific expedition to Oman and Hadramaut (Arabia) in October next. I enclose a translation into English of a letter dated the 7th instant, by which the society has asked the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs for his assistance to obtain the necessary facilities, and which also indicates the purpose and composition of the expedition.

M. J. H. Davidsen, lieutenant in the Danish artillery, and M. Barclay Raunkj^r, a student of arts. Especially M. Davidsen, the leader of the expedition, is quite well acquainted with the Arabian language. The expedition will return to Denmark m April or May 19 . The basis of operation will be the land about and back of Muscat towards the great desert, and also the parts of Hadramaut adjacent to Oman, i.e., the South-Eastern Arab The expedition is exclusively scientific geographical, and its object will consist in investigations into these little known or quite unknown districts from a geogiaphica , ethnographic, ethnological, botanical, and archaeologic point oi view. #Ke expedition will go from Copenhagen to Aden on board a Danish ship (probablv on board a steamer belonging to the Danish East Atlantic line) and on boaid an English ship from Aden to Muscat, where the operations have to begin _ As the Arabian coast from Aden to Muscat belongs to the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom, the expedition cannot do without a permission ^ Government, and also without obtaining protection from the aV.nvP mentioned country.

(DLUFSEN, Secretary.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] report that I received a visit on the 8th instant from Admiral Richelieu and Professor Olufsen, who called on me on behalf of the Royal Danish Geographical Society, in order to give me some particulars as to the proposed Danish expedition to the lands bordering on the Persian Gulf. Admiral Richelieu, in handing me the formal letter of which a copy is enclosed, said that this paper set forth the objects of the expedition, but that he wished to add a few words of further explanation. The expedition was, the admiral said, purely scientific, and not in any way concerned with the acquisition of commercial or material advantages, as had been stated in the press. The idea was to take up the researches of Niebuhr at the point where he had left them, and to follow up the traces of ancient civilisation which he had discovered and recorded in his writings Equally, the expedition had no political aims, the best proof of this being the fact that the services of Lieutenant Davidsen, who would lead it, had only been lent for this enterprise, while he himself remained on the active list of the Danish army. The expedition would remain away for six months in the first instance, but if success attended its efforts it was probable that a further extension of its activity, say over a period of three years in all, might follow. The results of the researches would be embodied in an English book, which would at once be placed at the disposal of His Majesty’s Govern ment. There was no question of employing any Englishmen on the expedition, as had ( erroneously been stated in the press. On the other hand, having regard to the fact that the country which was to be explored lay in the British sphere of influence, the approval of His Majesty’s Government and the assistance of the British local authorities were indispensable. Admiral Richelieu, therefore, begged me to recommend the expedition to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government, and asked that an early reply might be returned to his application in order that the necessary prepara tions might be put in hand as soon as possible. THE Royal Danish Geographical Society has, through its committee for sending- out geographical expeditions, partly from different institutions and ^ partly by private subscriptions, collected sufficient funds to enable it to send out a scientific expedition to South Arabia, where the Geographical Society considers that useful work can be done by it by continuing the explorations which our countryman Carsten Niebuhr undertook at the end of the 18th century. We are, however, aware that the country in question is in the sphere of British influence or under British protection, and we venture therefore to ask your Excellency kindly to assist our Geographical Society in obtaining the sanction of the British Government that our little expedition may travel in South Arabia, and we venture to hope that the British Government will give us its moral support and the kind assistance of its residents in South Arabia, which, we are sure will be necessary if our expedition shall fulfill our hopes of doing useful work and of continuing in a worthy manner the explorations of Carsten Niebuhr. It is our intention that the expedition should leave Denmark about the 1st October, 1911. Its members will be lieutenant in the artillery M. P. H. Davidsen and M. Barclay [2058 5 — 1 ] PERSIA.

I have now the honour to inform you that, having noticed the article, of which a translation is enclosed, in the u Politiken ” of the 29th ultimo, announcing the intended dispatch of the expedition in October next, I reminded Count Ahlefeldt that his predecessor in office had been requested to furnish His Majesty’s Government with information as to the scope of the undertaking, and I asked his Excellency to he good enough to cause me to be put in communication with the promoters of the affair. I added that I observed from the newspaper article that it was intended to apply for the protection of the British Government in order to penetrate into the country, and that some of the members of the exploring party were to be Englishmen. Count Ahlefeldt said that he would ask Professor Olufsen, the secretary of the Geographical Society, to place himself at my disposal and to give me particulars. His Excellency added that he supposed the main interest which His Majesty’s Government would have in the proposed expedition would be that it should in no way countenance the introduction of arms into the country.

Extract from the “Politiken” of April 29, 1911. 2.1 (Translation.) A Danish Expedition to the Persian Gulp. The Committee of the Geographical Society dispatches its First Expedition. Interview with Professor Olcfsen. THE committee, which was constituted a year ago, includes Admiral Richelieu, President; Professor Olufsen, Secretary of the Geographical Society; Consul Valdemar Gliickstadt, and M. M. L. Frimodt. Professor Olufsen has made the following statement “ The obiect of the committee is to send out geographical expeditions, and at the same time to ascertain how the commerce of Denmark can be developed in unknown lands. We are dispatching an expedition, with this double aim in view, to the Peisian Gulf, to Oman and Hadramaut, starting from the town of Muscat m South-Eastern Arabia. The well-known Danish explorer Carsten Niebuhr travelled through Arabia in the eighteenth century. In Omar and Hadramaut British interests are strongly represented, and we must apply for the protection of the British Government in order to penetrate into the country. The expedition will consist of Lieutenant Davidsen of the artillery, and Mr. Raunkiaer (slid mag.) both of whom know Arabic and are well fitted both for travelling and study. The remaining members [2020 p—2]of tho oxpGclitioii will be Englishmen. First Lieutencint Envidsen will map the country It is owned by Sultans, and, although the trade routes to the East have passed roun jt for centuries, is entirely unknown. In olden times theie was a certain ci\ disation i. those parts—that of Sheba (Queen of Sheba). No doubt traces will be found by th expedition m inscriptions, rums, &amp;c., which may also piove impoitant. Studei^ Eaunkiaer has made a speciality of the study of commercial geography, which hr taken so great an extension in Germany. He is quite young, but very efficient an intelligent. He will study the people, their habits, customs, and specially thei. trade, and the field which the latter may offer foiyEuropean enterprise. All that par of Arabia is a sort of colonial, warehouse, providing coffee, dates, and other southen fruits ; and generally articles which we and others require without any steps having ever been taken to enter into closer relations with the country. ^ « “ The steamers of the East Asiatic Company pass close by on their regular routes. Here, as in so many other places on this globe, there is an opening for Danish energy and enterprise. * . “ The expedition will in all probability sail for Aden m a steamer of the East Asiatic Company, and will start, at earliest, on the 1st October in order to be home again in the spring of 1912. That is the best time to go. From Aden the expedition will proceed to Muscat, and push from there into the interior. The committee’s work is supported by the subscriptions of private well-wishers. “ We hope to secure real work for Danish interests. A small country which dispatches a small and modest expedition can, perhaps, do more useful work than the costly and pretentious arrangements of a great country.” We annex a map of the regions near the Persian Gulfwhere the expedition dispatched by the Expeditions Committee of the Geographical Society will reclaim new ground—Oman and Hadramaut. The interior is, according to geographers, a desert, but probably contains great oases and remains of an ancient civilisation dating back to 500 years B.c. The members of the expedition, First-Lieutenant Davidsen and student Eaunkiaer, will travel on camels and asses. The travellers start in October and expect to return in May 1912 (see article). * Not reproduced.r- , 1 : 5097 . / f Uth May 1910, Sir, ynth ref Branca to the of the Mnd Aj.nl 1910, M.Ju24, I am airactat to infom you that for reasons of policy it has bean dendea by w Secretary of State for Inaia in Council that .

At the same time it is open to question whether the utility of such journeys is not outweighed by the disadvantage of the suspicion which they arouse in the minds of the Turks, to which His Ma jesty's Consul-General at Bagdad has several times re- \ ! \ verted, notably in the concluding passages of his Sum mary of Events for both January and February, which I had the honour to transmit to you in my despatch Mo.207, ir E.

I have the honour to forward, for transmiseion to the War Office, an interesting report and sketch map which I have received from Captain Teesdale, 25th. Cav alry, Indian Army. The report contains the following:- A general report. Itinerary, with dates. Poad reports:- by camel from El Zobeir to Kham- siyeh; by canal and river from Khamsiyeh, via Suk-es-Sheyukh, to Kurna. Report on the lines of approach to Basrah from the W. and N.W. Note on river transport. Resume of routes. Captain Teesdale, on returning to India from leave, went via Constantinople and Aleppo, whence he struck ' t the Euphrates at Meskineh, and descended the river as * \ far as Feluja - about a fortnight. From Feluja he drove to Baghdad. Ls Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Cx. Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. His &gt;His chief object was to cross the desert from about Nasriyeh to Basrah, to see whether there was a practicable route here, cutting off the bend of the Eu phrates. Though unable to get down from Baghdad to Nasriyeh, as explained on page 1, he achieved his ob ject by working back from Basrah through this portion of the desert to Suk-es-Sheyukh. To do this he had to dress as an Arab, and from private letters I gather that he underwent some rough experiences, both during these days and while returning down the river in a sa- fina crowded with pilgrims. A day or two later he was caught by a Turkish gunboat and taken to Basrah, as re lated on page 2 of his report. Owing to the expira tion of his leave he was unable to do the bit between Suk-es-Sheyukh and Nasriyeh. His rencontre with the Turkish officers too was unfortunate as it prevented him from going down the Nahr Antar, which would have been interesting. Points of general interest in the report are the friendliness of the various Sheikhs of the Muntefik and the hospitality shown to the English traveller, their dissatisfaction with the Turkish Government, the unsafe state of that part of the country, the importation of riflesrifles, and the idea that the British Government is try ing to obtain a foothold in Mesopotamia. It was enterprising of Captain Teesdale to take this route back to India, giving up thereby a portion of his leave at home, and he showed energy and resource in getting through, which he succeeded in doing without any assistance . I hope that his report and map will be founa use ful, and that his name may be noted for employment on this sort of work in Turkey, should the occasion arise, \ more especially as he has taken the trouble to study the language, and passed an examination in Turkish while at home.

Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of Events in Turkish Irak during February 1910. I .—Musal Vilayet. 1. HOSTILITIES between the Turkish authorities and the Barazani Sheikh (see Summary, December 1909-January 1910, I, 1) still continue, and about the 2nd February the sheikh captured 100 rifles from the troops employed against him. The vali remains at his head-quarters, and it seems improbable that any serious effort will be made by the Turks before the advent of spring. Meanwhile the British vice-consul at Musal has received a letter from Sheikh Barazani in which the writer asks to be taken under British protection. 2. The transfer from Suleimanieh to Musal of the Court of Inquiry on the Hama wand disaster, mentioned in the last summary (I, 2), has been temporarily countermanded. It is stated that Nazim Pasha, vali elect of Bagdad, who is still at Constantinople, has proposed to the Ministry of War that a body of local irregular horse should be raised to make incursions on and punish the Hamawand. 3. Raids by Arabs from the direction of the Euphrates into the vicinity of Musal, similar to that already reported (see Summary, November 1909, I, 2), appear to be increasing ; and the Shammar are now faking part in them as well as the Dilaim. Between the first and the 4th February, near Tall Afar, about eight hours’ journey from Musal, Sheikhs Shallal and Asi of the Shammar obliged a party of fifteen or twenty merchants who were travelling with sheep to Aleppo to deliver up fifteen camels, a quantity of provisions, and (it is stated) £ T. 500 in cash. About 3,000 sheep were carried off by the same sheikhs from various villages near Musal belonging to Abu Badran Arabs ; and some shepherds in the service of Pasha (see Summary, November 1909, I, 1) were severely beaten by Shammar tribesmen not far from Musal. On the 13th February, again near Tall Afar, Sheikh Shallal extorted blackmail, amounting to£T. 150, from two travelling merchants of Aleppo and one of Hama, whose 15,000 sheep he had first seized ; and on the same day a large gang of Dilaim made their appearance at Hamman Ali, only six hours distant from Musal, and swept off more than 4,000 sheep owned by an inhabitant of the town. The idea of military operations against the predatory tribes (see Summary, December 1909-January 1910, I, 3) has been revived, and the vali of Musal is said to be in telegraphic correspondence with the military authorities at Bagdad and Damascus with a view to combined action. Meanwhile a force of seventy-five gendarmes under a lieutenant has been sent out against the Shammar ; and endeavours are being made at Musal to equip a military movable column consisting of 250 sabres of the 22nd Cavalry Regiment* and two guns, for service against the Shammar and Dilaim, but there is a great deficiency of horses. * This regiment Delongs to the IVth Army Corps, from which it would appear that troops are now Leing brought in from other provinces. [2710 1—2] BThe Turkish authorities have thus on their hands three different affairs m the Musal vilayet alone—with the Barazani Sheikh, with the I lama wan d^ and with the Euphrates tribes-any one of which single, it is probable, would sufficiently tax the disposable remarkable developments in the Catholic-Nestorian difficulty at Musal (see Summary, November 1909, I, 3, and December 1909 to January 1910 Mat 4 Elias, the Bishop of the Algosh Nestorians, arrived at Musal on the 23rd January 1910 bringing with him two letters from the authorities at Constantinople to the k&gt;cal' autWitJ afvan, in which it was ordered that he should be allowed to travel in those parts of the Van vilayet where there are Nestonans and that Nes torians should be (? separately) registered ; the letters dated so far back as the 19th August and 8th October, 1909, mentioned that identical instructions had been issued to the*Musal vilayet. On the strength of these letters Mar Elias travelled to Musal with Mr W A Wigram of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s mission, stopping on the way for two days at Algosh, where he was well received. On reaching Musal he took up his abode in the house of Mr. Nimrod Rassam, honorary dragoman of the British vice-consulate and reported his arrival to the local authorities whom he at the same time informed of the orders in his case. In reply he was told that fresh instructions had lately been received from Constantinople under which he must leave Musal and return to the place from which he had come. -.a u On the 3rd February the vati of Musal admitted, m cpnversation with the British representative, that he had not himself seen the alleged instructions for the removal of Mar Elias from Musal ; nevertheless on the 4th February, without any reference to the vice-consul, a party of gendarmes was sent to arrest the Bishop a,t Mr Rassam s house. A considerable crowd consisting mostly of Chaldean Catholics collected before the house, but the door was closed and the gendarmes did not go so far as to force it °P en - On the 5th February the Protestant community at Musal consisting of about 130 persons applied to Constantinople for recognition of Mar Elias as their official head; and late on the same day the vali made a formal request (to the British vice-consul) for the surrender of Mar Elias. , On the 7th February, a Monday, Mr. Greig replied that the matter was receiving his attention ; and he complained of the threatened violation of the honorary dragoman s house and asked what steps the vali proposed to take in regard to it. The vice-consul also received a petition from the local Protestant community, begging for his protection against the machinations of the Chaldean Patriarch. ^ , On the 8th February Mr. Greig suggested that, as Mar Elias was m bad health, the vali would represent to the authorities at Constantinople the inhumanity of obliging him to undertake another long journey in winter. On the next day the vali stated that he had received orders from head-quarters to arrange for Mar Elias being attended to in Government Hospital at Musal; meanwhile, however, the Bishop had left the house of Mr. Nimrod Rassam. ' • T u 4 It is understood that Catholic influence is being brought to bear against Javdat Bey, the maktubji or chief secretary to the vali. The Catholics evidently apprehend that, if Mar Elias is allowed full freedom, numbers of Nestorians who have joined the Catholic communion will revert to the Nestorian Church ; and it is unfortunately evident, from the news reports that I receive, that this would be regarded as a local success of British over French influence. For the information of the Government of India I should explain that, in matters such as the Catholic-Nestorian difficulty—in which immediate orders are required, the British vice-consul at Musal deals directly with His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople. Until I have visited Musal, it would be impossible for me even to make useful suggestions in cases requiring local knowledge. 5. A new cadi has lately been appointed to Musal in the person of Raghib Effendi, a native of Damascus. He will probably act as vali in case of Muhammad Pasha assuming direct charge of military operations, and it is feared that he has already come under the influence of Sabunji Pasha (see paragraph 3 above). II .—Bagdad Vilayet. 1. Last year some of the Dilaim, the same tribe as that which has been giving trouble in the Musal vilayet (see I, 3, above), were raided near Shifathah- by some o * See Persian Gulf Gazetteer, vol. ii, pp. 1801-5.the Abudah section of the Bani Hasan from the Hindieh Kadha who were encamped in the same locality. The Dilaim succeeded in obtaining an order from the vali of Bagdad for the return of 500 sheep, but it remained of no effect until the present month, when, the Abudah ^ having made their appearance at Razazah* * * § a force of gendarmes under a major was sent out by the mutessarif of Karbala to surprise them. About midnight on.the 13th the gendarmerie returned to Karbala, bringing with them about 400 sheep and the leading men of the Abudah, the latter with their arms bound. 2. About the beginningof February a'fray occurred within 3 or 4 miles of Kut-el- Amarah between the Ju’aifariehf and the inhabitants of a place named Nahr Izmam. The cause was a dispute about land. Two men were killed. 111.— Bagdad City. 1. In January last the case of a Jewish girl, the daughter of one Sasun, who is a Turkish subject, but is employed in the British Residency Post Office at Bagdad, came before the vali and his administrative council. The proceedings took place apparently, on a complaint from the father, to the effect that a Mahommedan, who wished to marry the girl, was endeavouring to persuade her to become a Mahommedan. The action to be taken depended on the age of the girl, who, if under fourteen, would have no power to change her religion without her guardian’s consent; and Vali Muhammad Shaukat Pasha, who is an enlightened man, gave his opinion in favour of the father. An acrimonious discussion took place between a Jewish member of the Council and the Mohammedan members, in consequence of which the latter presented a mazbatah or round-robin against the former—a son of Mr. M. S. Daniel—accusing him of having- insulted them, and, indirectly, their religion also; but the vali succeeded in inducing the Mahommedans to drop their complaint. The girl, her case being still undecided, has been left for the present in charge of the headman of the quarter. I shall recur to this incident further on in another connection. It is very like those that sometimes occur in India, causing dangerous excitement when Hindu women become proselytes to Islam for the sake of marrying Mahommedans. 2. The supply of public vehicles in Bagdad, notwithstanding their limited value in consequence of the narrowness of the streets, does not appear to keep pace with the demand. The municipality have approved a regulation under which coachmen will be punishable with fine if they take more than 10 G.S.P. (2s.) per hour for drives within the town. IV.— Bussorah Vilayet. 1. Before the middle of January, apparently, Falah-bin-SaihudJ of the A1 Bu Muhammad (see Summary, December 190.9-January 1910, IV, 2) paid a visit to the sheikh of Mohammerah, after which, it is said, he proceeded to Bussorah to see the Turkish vali. Towards the end of the month, Ghaddban, the fugitive sheikh of the Bani Lam, appeared within a few miles of Filaifilah,§ accompanied by two of his brothers and their followers, and by some 200 Sagwand horsemen, from the territory of the vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, who is his brother-in-law. Ghaddban had come on purpose to attack Jawi and Shabib, the leaders of the portion of the Bani Lam tribe which is loyal to the Turkish Government; but those sheikhs, supported by Sheikh Fahad, who crossed from the right bank of the Tigris to their assistance, defeated him in a battle on the 29th January, and pursued him and his followers to the Persian frontier. The casualties in the engagement are estimated at 100, and it is believed that the result will be conclusive for a time. 2. In January rather severe fighting took place in the Shatrat-al-Muntafik Kadha between the A1 Bu Seyyid|| and Ban Zaid tribes. The cause is unknown. 3. The pause in the “ Muntafik ” operations (see Summary, December 1909- January 1910, IV, 1) still continues. * See Persian Gulf Gazetteer, vol. ii, pp. 1587-S. | Apparently a section of the Bani Rabi‘ah twice mentioned at p. 1046 of vol. ii of the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. f The name appears to be Palah , not Fa‘lah as in the last Summary (IV, 2.) § See Persian Gulf Gazetteer, vol. ii, pp, 1900-1, | Not identifiable.

The activity of the Turkish Treasury in seeking additional sources of revenue is making itself felt in various ways even in this remote province. Towards the end of January an order was received from Constantinople by the vali of Bagdad, directing him in future to recover a tax on house property at the rate of 4 per cent, on the value of houses personally occupied by the owners, and at the rate of 8 per cent, on houses kept for letting. This is a new tax and its introduction is resentecb I am informed that the Treasury have lodged a claim to the Saiyafieh* reserved “forest” on the right bank of the Tigris near Ctesiphon, which is somehowJn the possession of the artillery of the 6th Army Corps, but to which, it is said, the Department of Religious Endowments and a private landowner (Ibn Jamil) also assert titles. An extensive tract of country on the left bank near the same place, viz., from the lower end of Kusaibah to the upper end of Safi, and including the Ctesiphon ruins, has hitherto been regarded as wakf, or a trust, in favour of the shrine of Suleiman Pak, which is situated in it. These lands have now been appropriated by the Treasury on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence of the existence of a trust ; and the Mutawallis or trustees of the shrine have been referred to the Law Courts for redress, whereas it is the Treasury who ought, according to law, to have sued the Mutawallis for possession. The members of the administrative council of the vali of Bagdad are said to have disapproved, with the exception of the defterdar, who is the provincial representative of the Treasury, of the high-handed seizure of the lands; and it is evident that the Nakib of Bagdad, at least, must view with alarm the apparent leaning of the new Government of Turkey towards a secularisation of religious endowments in this province. The Mutawallis have alreadly instituted proceedings. 2. At the beginning of February the vali of Bagdad received a cypher telegram from the Ministry of War, in which he was ordered not to publish any news about mobilisation and other military movements, and to prevent, so far as possible, references to such matters in the press. This may possibly have been due to articles which appeared sometime ago in the local newspapers upon the unsuccessful “ Mun- tafik ” operations. On the 2nd February another telegram came from the Ministry of War, for bidding military officers to take part in politics or to write to the newspapers. This second fiat has extinguished the local journal “ Bark,” which was edited by military officers. 3. It is reported that Nazim Pasha, who is destined to the valiship of Bagdad, and to the command of the 6th Army Corps, has selected at Constantinople over 100 young and capable military officers for employment under his orders in “Najd”(ie., probably Hasa), and in the campaigns against Sheikh Barazani and the “ Muntafik.” It is also stated that the Ministry of War has agreed,| on Nazim Pasha’s advice, to the formation of a telegraph (engineer) company to be attached to the 6th Army Corps. 4. An attempt is being made in the three vilayets of this province to induce civil officials, military officers, and Turkish subjects generally to subscribe money for the improvement of theTurkish fleet. It is stated that the mutessarif (commissioner) of Karbala has for this purpose withheld, or attempted to withhold, a month’s pay from all his immediate subordinates, and that most of them object strongly to his doing so. 5. Reorganisation and reform of the gendarmerie of the Bagdad, Bussorah, and Musal vilayets are proceeding apace. It seems that the Board described in my last Summary (V, 7) as a board of reorganisation is intending to be permanent; but that the European adviser, who is now visiting Bussorah, will remain only so long as the Government considers his retention necessary. There is, it appears, a separate gendarmerie board for each vilayet, consisting of the senior gendarmerie officers of the local force ; but (Colonel) Nuri Bey at Bagdad, who belongs to the army, is president of all three boards. Conditions of employment and service in the gendarmerie have now been laid down * See my Tour Journal, No. 1 , of 1910 under date of February 13. It is said to have been seized by Sabri Pasha, a former commandant of the artillery, partly for his own private benefit and partly for that of f&gt; his corps.

There seems to be a strong feeling here in official circles that a force inter mediate m character between regular troops and armed police is required in order to deal successfully with the refractory tribes of the province. The vali lately informed me that he had asked for a specia force of 4,000 mounted men, and that his application had been well received by the Ministry of War, but rejected by the civil departments. On a reference from the central Government a discussion on the subject was held in the bara! at Bagdad about the middle of January last, and I hear that one of the schemes afterwards propounded to the vali was for the creation of a camel corps, || about 1,000 strong, which should be at the disposal of the civil authorities.

The works immediately concemplated appear to be (a.) The repair of the old Hindieh barrage ; (b.) The construction of a new Hindieh barrage ; (c) The construction of a regulator at the head of the Salawieh ; and The opening of an escape into the Habbanieh Lake. Bungalows for the European engineers are to be built at once near these places. I understand that Sir William’s scheme for a light railway from Bagdad to Fallujah to reduce the difficulty of transporting materials., has not been very favourably received by the Ministry of Public Works at Constantinople.

VX —Persian Affairs. 1. A number of more or less influential Persian refugees and tra^ elleis aie at present in Turkish Irak. Among them are Kurban Ali, said to be a mujtan o e ^ and there suspected of reactionary principles, who came to Kadhimam owar s middle of February; Seyyid Abdul Kasim, a son-in-law of the late Muzaffar-ud-Hm Shah and formerly Imam Jum’eh at Tehran, who arrived at Kadhimam 10 m u ^ few days ago; and the Ihtisham-ud-Daulan with his wife the Kami-us u ane latter a daughter of the late Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah,—who reached Kad imam Karbala on the 19th of February.

He retired last year before attaining the age limit.1 and a great friend of Muhammad Pasha (Daghistani), the present vali of Musal also came to Kadhimain on the 19th February; he was formerly a Persian subject, but transferred his allegiance to Turkey some time ago. ^ 2. The Zahir-ul-Mulk (see summary, December, 1909-January, 1910, VI 5) left Kadhimain on the 19th February with his family for his home at Kirmanshah ; he seems to have returned there in consequence of a telegram from the governor. It is said here that he is the principal chief of the Sinjab Kurds, and that his son at present commands the Persian artillery at Kirmanshah. 3. I am informed by Lieutenant Wilson, His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, that, in addition to the Persian Nationalist Society mentioned in my last summary (VI 4), there is one of which the letters are dated from Bussorah and which styles itself the “ Anjuman-i-Ghaib-i-Mamur-i-Janub-i-Iran,” that is, presumably, the “Southern Persia Secret Society.” This society addresses abusive and threatening letters to the sheik of Mohammerah, to Mr. Wilson himself, and occasionally to the officials of the Mohammerah Customs House. Its objection to the sheikh appears to be that he is well-disposed towards the British Government. VII.— Najd. After next month the summary will contain such news as is procurable here of Central Arabian affairs. VIII .—British Interests and Cases. 1. There were no further local developments in the “ Affaire Lynch ” (see Summary, December, 1909-January, 1910, VII, 5), except that Mr. T. D. Cree, a British merchant at Bagdad, submitted a moderately worded protest against the supposed navigation Concession to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and this I duly transmitted to the proper quarter on the 21st February. Some supplementary observations by Mr. Cree were sent after it on the 27th February. Mulla Kazim (Khurasani) and Sheikh Abdullah (Mazandarani), two intriguing Mujtahids of Nejef, both of whom are in receipt of allowances under the Oudh Bequest, have memorialised the Turkish Government against a “monopoly of navigation.” On the other hand the military clerk, Kadhim (Kijaili) who delivered an affecting speech at the demonstration'^ held at Bagdad on the 20th December, has lately been seeking employment in this residency or with Sir William Willcocks, from which it would appear that his antipathy to the British cannot be very deep-seated. 2. Some of the British travellers mentioned in the last Summary (VII, 6) have since then performed considerable journeys. Mr. Whitaker, reached his destination in safety. Captain Teesdale, on reaching Bussorah, proceeded to Zubair, whence he made a flying expedition by camel to Khamisieh and Suk-ash-Shuyukh on the Euphrates, and returned to Bussorah by boat via Kurnah. The arrangements for his journey were made by Arab Sheikh and the whole tour only occupied about a week. Captain Teesdale then proceeded to India. Mr. Leachman left Bagdad on the 25th January for Karbala, in the neighbourhood of which he joined on the next day a body of Shammar, belonging to the Ja’far section of the ’Abdal division of that tribe, who were returning to Najd. Mr. Leachman placed himself under the protection of Sheikh Majid-bin-Ajal, whose sister was the wife of Abd-el-Aziz, late ruler of Jabal Shammar ; Mr. Leachman had made his acquaintance while encamped on the Mesopotamian plains. On the 24th February news, which I believe to be authentic, was brought to Bagdad by Arabs to the effect that Mr. Leachman had arrived at Hail in safety. Mr. Fowle undertook a journey during part of January and February on the east side of the Tigris and travelled by Ba’kuban and Kifri to Kirkuk, and thence to Suleimanieh, from which he returned to Bagdad by the direct route through Kifri. These tours by British military officers, occurring more or less together and at a time when there was much talk of British designs on Mesopotamia, naturally rendered the Turks suspicious, the more so that Mr. Leachman and Captain Teesdale avoided observation as much as they could and wore Arab clothes. In fact official telegrams seem to have been sent to Karbala, Hilla, and other places ordering the local officials to keep a look-out for Mr. Leachman, but he succeeded in evading them. * * See report on the “ Affaire Lynch ” in Irak. I)Mr Fowle, who travelled openly with Turkish gendarmes, was very closely watched. As will be seen below (IX, 3) I took the first opportunity that presented itselfofdiscussingthematterfrankly withthe vah of Bag a 3 Mr. D. Fraser, lately correspondent ot the limes at ienran, arrived at , TWdad on the 9 th February on his way home. ju+i Bagdad o Busso h h f or the accommodation of Indian pilgrims owned by the Faiz-i-Husaini, a wealthy and benevolent Borah association, has been partially demolished by the vali of Bussorah in connection with some improvements that he is “out hi the town. The British consul at Bussorah is watching the case with a view to obtaining for the Borahs the utmost amount of compensation legally recoverable. IX.— British Official Matters. 1 On the 1st February the vali of Bagdad, Muhammad Shaukat Pasha, dined privately at the residency. The other guests were Veisi Bey, the customs mspector from Constantinople ; Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan, an aged Indian nobleman ;Menahim Saleh Daniel, one of the principal Jews of Bagdad ; and Captams Finn,s and McPherson and Mr Gaskin of the residency staff. The invitations to the native guests were fssued after consultation with his Excellency, who was quite at his ease and talked freely The Indian Nawab is 70 years of age and frail but he is a valuable ally of the British resident; he enjoys much consideration m Bagdad, both with the Turks and with other classes. His father was a Minister in the kingdom of Oudh. _ 2. From the 11th to the .16th February I was on tour on the Comet upon the Tigris below Bagdad. A separate tour report has been submitted. ^ 3 On the 23rd January I visited the vail at the Sarai. Mr. Fraser (see VIII, 3, above) accompanied me, and a general conversation took place with regard to the state of affairs in Turkey, particularly in Irak. On the whole, we found ourselves veiy much in accord, but the vali appeared to under-rate the possibility which, of course, was very lightly touched upon of future difficulties arising from religion in this province (In the past the Mahommedan element has been exclusively predominant here and Jews and Christians have quietly accepted a position of inferiority but already there are indications that under the constitution this may not continue to be The incident which lately occurred in the vali’s administrative council (see III, 1, above) is cited as an instance of the spirit of independence which is now beginning to animate the politically depressed classes, and the effects of competition upon more or less equal terms cannot fail ultimately to be unpleasant to the Mahommedans ihe relative position of Mahommedan and non-Mahommedan in the Irak is slightly analogous to that of European and native in India. . . A Before leaving I opened the question of British travellers m Mesopotamia, and explained to the vali the cause (the inducements now offered m India to students ot oriental languages) which were attracting young military officers to this country. I said that I should advise all of them to keep m close touch with the lurkisd authorities on their journeys, and to avoid the unprofitable discussions mo w ic Arabs sometimes sought to draw them. The vali said that he considered the rs o these suggestions much the more important, and that he would be much obliged to me if I could keep him informed of the intended movements of British travellers. _ This I shall endeavour to do, and I hope that there will be no more suspicion on the part of the Turks in regard to officers who are merely travelling within the bounds of the three vilayets or proceeding from Bagdad to Aleppo or to Damascus on their way to Europe. In the case of would-be explorers of Central Arabia, however, it is clear that difficulties may recur, but some allowance must be made for the sensitiveness of the Turks in regard to Najd, which is to them almost exactly what Afghanistan is to the Government of India. . 4. Captain H. Crossle, I.M.S., lately surgeon of the Kirmanshah consulate, arme at Bagdad on the 19th February, and on the 22nd February left again for Musca , o which he has been transferred. Part of the hospital equipment is to be transfene rom Kirmanshah, where it is no longer required, to the Bagdad residency. 5. Mr. C. Greig, the new British vice-consul at Musal, arrived there on ie 22nd January and assumed charge on the 30th, when Mr. Wilkie Young left foi is new appointment. # ^ , ,, 6. The sepoys of the Bagdad residency guard, supplied by the 117 th Mahra &gt; are a well-conducted body of men, and seem to be spending their leisure time here m aivei 1) Willj tc, jg 9 profitable manner. All of them are studying Arabic, and a few are working at Persian or English as well. The Subedar Miyandin Khan was formerly a cavalry officer, and with his help and that of a Naik of the detachment who holds a veterinary certificate, the resident is able to obtain horses for persons, such as Sir William Willcoc s engineers, who happen to require them. It is, perhaps, not generally understood that at Bagdad the guard never appear outside the high residency wall in umtorm, still less with arms, and that all reasonable cause of offence to the Turks is thus avoided. ^ or Officiating Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul - General, Bagdad), J.

His Majesty’s Government, after careful consideration, have come to the conclusion that expeditions into these distant regions for purposes of sport or amusement should be carefully scrutinised, and that leave to undertake them should only be given when some special reasons exist for exceptional treatment. I request that Your Excellency’s Government will be guided by this principle in dealing with applications of this kind, and that the Military Authorities may be instructed to apply it strictly in the case of applications which it rests with them to decide. -4. I am not aware whether Lieutenant R, Pigot has yet started on his journey, but if he has not, and if he failed to obtain the sanction of the Military Authorities in India before the application on his behalf was made to the Foreign Office in London, 1 consider that his request should be refused.

India Office, 25th November 1908. 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India to request that in all cases of journeys undertaken by British subjects in those regions of Asia in which the Government of India are interested, this Office may be consulted before passports are granted. The permission of the Government of India is necessary before travellers can cross the land frontiers into India, and inconvenience arose recently in the case of Lieutenant H. Whitaker, who proceeded to India, via the Tashkend Railway and Kulja, with a passport obtained from the Foreign Office, but without the necessary permission of the military authorities. Even in cases where travellers do not propose to enter India, it is desirable that timely notification should be made to the Government of India of the countries they propose to visit and the routes they propose to follow.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you request, by direction of the Secretary of State for India, that in all cases of journeys undertaken by British subjects in those regions of Asia in which the Government of India are interested, the India Office may be consulted before passports are granted. I am to state in reply that if you will be good enough to clearly define the regions referred to, every endeavour shall be made to comply with Lord Morley’s request. I am to observe, however, that passports are also issued by His Majesty’s Consular officers abroad, and that in order to give entire effect to the request, it would seem to be necessary to instruct them to refer home, by telegraph, all applications for passports for travelling in the regions referred to. The Under Secretary of State for India.Enclosure No. 3. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, o- r 25th January 1909. I am directed by Viscount Morley to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 41,405, of the 12th December 1908, asking for more precise information as to the scope of the request made m my letter of the 25th November 1908, that in all cases of journeys undertaken by British subjects in those regions of Asia in which the Government of India are interested, this Office may be consulted before passports are granted. 2. Lord Morley recognises a certain difficulty in laying down a hard and fast definition in a matter of this kind. But he would desire to be consulted whenever (1) as in the case of Lieutenant Whitaker, the traveller visits countries adjoining India, either with the intention of entering India across the land frontier, or under circumstances which may make it necessary for him so to enter India; and also (2) in all cases such as that of Lieutenant Robert Bigot (reported in I oreign Office letter No. 38,382, of 25th November last), where the traveller is either in the Indian services, or in a British regiment stationed in India, or domiciled in India. In both classes of cases it would be well to make the consent of the Government of India a condition antecedent to the grant of a passport. 3. As regards the regions which come within the scope of the request made in my letter of the 25th November 1908, Lord Morley considers that it would be convenient that he should be consulted when journeys are contemplated, not only in the countries adjoining India, where the question of crossing the land frontier may arise, but in Arabia in the vicinity of the Aden hinterland, Nejd, Koweit, Muscat, or other places where the Local Governments are in treaty relations with the Government of India. On the other hand, Lord Morley would not extend his request, except in cases falling under class (2) of the preceding paragraph, to ordinary journeys by recognised routes, not of the nature of explorations. 4. With reference to the question of procedure when applications for passports are made to His Majesty’s Consular officers abroad, I am to say that when it is proposed to issue such passports in the case .of officers in the Indian services, it would be desirable that the previous consent of the Government of India should be a condition of the grant of a pass port ; and that, in other cases, the Consular officers might, in Lord Morley’s opinion, be instructed to act on their discretion, informing the Government of India of the action taken, when the circumstances are not such as to involve crossing the land frontier of India, or otherwise to make prior consultation necessary. 5. Lord Morley, I am to add, recognises that the procedure he recom mends for adoption may involve certain inconveniences. But he thinks it desirable, on grounds of policy, that facilities for journeys of the kind should not be given without the knowledge and consent of the Government of India.

I applied to India for pemission to cross Arabia via Madina through the great un known tracts of South Arabia to ’Oraan. thence to India. At the same time I laid my plans before the Royal Geographical Society and the American Geographical Society. The Government of India referred the question to tne Secretary of State for India, and to-day. in answer to cabled inquiries, the Surveyor General of India cabled that I sftouio apply to the Secretary of State, to whom the question,as to whether India should permit the exploration or not. has been referred.o - 2 &lt; The long delay involved by referring the question, uogethei v/itii the political situation in Turkey, has caused me to alter my plan of exploration considerably. It may be that the possibility of political difficulties arising from the sanction ol my plan of exploration as submitted, may have caused India to go very carefully before encouraging the enterprise. As tne assistance ol the Government of India would be most valuable I wish to know, before leaving America, exactly what moral help the Government of India would lend to the enter prise. Would it be asking too great a favour of you to ask you to inquire from the Secretary of State just what the India Office have advised the Government to do. In asking this question, in order that the answer mai; be based upon the proper idea of the exploration, it would greatly oblige me if you would submit for me the enclosed plan of exploration. This proposal differs from that submitted to India and referred to the Secretary of State, kiLJJas. .famiT- of . the, possibility of I ndia practicability of the exploration. Wow I know that this request of mine is not according to tne rules and regulations that the plan should first go to India, but owing to the fact that my leave is not sufficient to permit of this routine procedure being adopted, and the unusual nature of the whole enterprise, I think perhaps the Secretary of State may be induced to overlook the method of putting the inquiry before him.Toronto, 6th April, 1910. / Aero /air - Prom Captain F.

Interview with Professor Olufsen. ai ' a THE Geographical Society issued the following statement yesterday evening “The Committee of the Royal Geographical Society have taken the initiative in a plan for sending an expedition to the countries around the Peisiau G . [2491 ff — 4] m“The object of the expedition is to examine the ethnographical, topographical, botanical and ethnological conditions obtaining in the ^ districts in question, and also at the same time to collect information as to conditions which may have practi^ 7 ’ importance. “ A scientific exploration of these districts is an excellent piece of work for oiu Geographical Society. Without going into details we can say that only few parts of the globe are so rich in material which calls for examination from a scientific point of view. “ To what extent this exploration will prove capable of execution depends upon the support accorded to the enterprise by the institutions and private persons to whom application has been made. “ It is to be hoped that this excellent undertaking, which may redound to the honour and advantage of our country, will meet with the necessary support.” Immediately on receipt of the above statement we paid a visit to the secretary of the Geographical Society, Professor Olufsen, and begged him to give us a few more details of the new expedition and its object. But the Professor’s lips were sealed with seven seals. “ All that I can tell you is that a Committee has been formed at the request of the Geographical Society to make preparations for the expedition.” “ Can you not tell us something about the Committee ?” “ I really don’t know,” replied the Professor. “ Who is the chairman ?” “Well; yes,” the Professor yields whilst still on the defensive : “the chairman is Admiral Bichelieu.” “ And the others ?” “ Professor Frants Buhl, Major-General Pasmussen, Consul V. Gliickstadt, Herr M. L. Frimodt (a large merchant) and Professor Olufsen. Pow are you satisfied ?” “No, far from it.” “Well, you are not going to be told anything more,” said the Professor, severely. “ When is the expedition to leave ?” “ In the course of 1910, as soon as we have collected sufficient money. An expedition ot this kind can [sic] be ready to start in the course of a couple of days.” “ Is the State to be asked to contribute ?” “No. We are only applying to various funds and private persons.” “ In the statement there is something about ‘ practical exploration does that by any chance mean investigations of a commercially practical nature ?” “General practical geographical exploration is meant, also with reference to commerce; it is very likely that a commercial expert may be associated as a member ot the expe dition. But for that matter there is work enough in all directions round the Persian Gulf.” “ Yes, and now we come to the heart of the whole matter, Professor. Where is the expedition to begin, and who is to lead it ?” Professor Olufsen smiled knowingly, and replied in the famous words of Sir E. Shackleton : “ You must be early if you want to catch me. Wouldn’t you just like to know ?”jTfais Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ; ^ SIAM. CONFIDENTIAL. r- i [January 9.] Section 2. [1040] No.L Mr. Beckett to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 9, 1909.) (No. 94. Confidential.) gj r Bangkok, December 4, 1908. I HAVE the honour to report that, amongst numerous other visitors to Bangkok on the occasion of the recent Jubilee of the King of Siam, was Vice-Admiral du P. de Richelieu. A short sketch of Admiral de Richelieu’s career and of the various interests, chiefly commercial, which connect him with Siam, is given in section 13 of the General Report for 1906. As a Director of the East Asiatic Company (Limited), and as a large shareholder in Siamese Railway and Tramway Concessions, he has accumulated considerable wealth. He now resides in Denmark. He owns a large country house which was once the property of the King of Greece, and also a mansion in Copenhagen. As one of the Directors of the Landsmanns Bank, and Chamberlain to the King of Denmark, and a personal friend of Prince Waldemar’s, he exercises considerable influence at the Danish Court and in Danish political circles, so much so that, as he informed me during his recent visit here, he was instrumental in preventing t e proposed cession of the Danish West Indian Islands, and more recently, during &lt; the Alberti scandals, he was consulted by the Cabinet and oflered the portloho of Minis er of Commerce and Agriculture. This offer he refused, as he preferred commercial to ^ That so busy a man as Admiral de Richelieu should find it convenient to take the long journey to Siam for the purpose merely of paying his respects to the King on t e occasion of His Majesty’s Jubilee raised some curiosity in my mind as to whether the visit was not really connected with some other objects. , m n . It had already occurred to me that opposition to the proposed Treaty with Great Britain on the ground that the cession of Trengannu and Kelantan or general arrange ments regarding the Malay Peninsula would affect the interests of the East Asiatic Company^(Limited), in that region might possibly be the cause of the visit If such were P the case, there was in my mind considerable fear les t. the Admiral ta ^ advantage of the intimate relations which exist between himseif and the K g poison His Majesty’s mind against the Treaty as to change His Majesty s rather wavering attitude into one of direct antagonism. , , .. . I was considering how best to sound the Admiral on this rather delicate su ij , when Mr. Westengard expressed to me a fear on his part also ot such a contingency arising, and consulted me as to the advisability of taking some steps to prevent it 1 told him that, unless Admiral Richelieu broached the subje| to me '^^tal t o rai“ yet done, it was out of the question for me, intimately as I knew the Admiral, to raise th6 q Some 0 few days after my conversation with Mr. Westengard, the latter informed me that the Admiraf had beei? to see him, and directly alluded to the Treaty m such a manner as evinced a total misunderstanding of the main T 1 ?. r rob v erv . ° negotiations have taken place. For instance, he made use of the word robbeiy in connection with the proposed cession of territory, and was loud ln l l 1S , c^uVtlnces 3, policy of spoliation on the part of Great Britain against Siam Under the circumstances, Mr Westengard thought it wise to inform him frankly of the main features ot t e negotiationsfand too® pains more especially to impress upon him that there was no Question of any “robbery” of Siamese territory by Great Britain, but that tbe cession of territory was suggested by Mr. Strobel in the best interests of Siam. As a result of this and other conversations that took place between Mr. Westengard and tt Admiral, the former was satisfied that he had removed for the present at least the danger of direct hostility against the Treaty on the part of the Admira The latter called on me last week previous to his departure, and foi the hist time alluded to the Treaty. Whilst being careful to give him no further mformation than that which Mr Westengard, as I knew, had already given to him, I was able to from him categorical assurances that he did not now view the cession of terr.tory as an act [2137 i—2] I /&lt;wgBF of robbery that the cession would not injuriously affect the interests of the East Asiatic Company (Limited), that he thought it better the Treaty should now go through, and that he had no intention now of creating opposition. , , , . , I think it clear that one of the causes of the Admirals visit was to do his utmost to block the Treaty and 1 venture to submit that, with the disappearance of the Admiral’s antagonism, one obstacle at least that may have proved serious has now been r£TTlOV 6 Ci • • I understand from Mr. Westengard that Admiral Richelieu’s visit was connected also with another subject. I understood Mr. Westengard to say that, owing to the financial difficulties in which the Danish Government find themselves owing to he malversation of the ex-Finance Minister, Alberti, the Admiral had been deputed by that Government to endeavour to raise a loan in Siam. Mr. Westengard did not tell me if the Admiral’s appeal had been successful, but 1 should imagine that, in the present state of Siam’s finances, she would hardly be m a position to offer Denmark any pecuniary assistance from the public funds. r I have, &amp;c.
