I am aesired to forward herewith a provisional tour programme for the Iraqi engineer's impending visit to the major irrigation works in India. The programme has been drawn up after consultation with the Provincial G-overnments, and it will take the engineer about three * months to inspect all the irrigation works mentioned in it. To this may be added a month for journeys from one Province to the other. The tour will therefore last rougjily four months. Should the engineer be unable to spend this length of time in India, the programme could be modified in consultation with the Provincial Governments when the engineer reaches their headquarters. About ten days could, for instance, be saved, if the engineer decides not to visit the irrigation works in Bihar. The Government of Bihar do not consider that the engineer is likely to gain anything by visiting the small canals in that Province. REC* POL. DEPt. -8 JAN1940 INDIA The OFFIgfe;'''V L 1940 i 3.

Ref: IRAQ/22/4 3rd October, 1939- Dear Sir, It has been suggested by Mr. Deeper of the Foreign Office that the Council should sponsor the visit of an Iraqi irrigation engineer to India in order to study at first hand the work done by British irrigation engineers, with a view to improving present irrigation conditions in Iraq. The Government of India has, I believe, been already approached in this matter and has promised to co-operate. I should, therefore, be most grateful if you would let me know how long you think that the visit should last in order to be worth while, and also if you would be so kind as to plan his tour to the best advan tage.

Provincial Governments have been consulted and they have expressed their willingness to show the engineer some irrigation works and to give him all necessary help. If the visit is to take place we shall be grateful for prior information regarding the date of arrival of the engineer and the duration of his stay in India, so that a programme may be drawn up for him in consultation with Provincial Governments* / R*TJ?eel.

(E 4504/1988/93) 9th Deceraher, 1938 C? 2-^ ^ My dear Gibson, If you refer to Bagdad despatch No* 315 of which a copy was sent to you in our official letter E 4504/1982/93 of 8th September, you will see that in paragraph 15 Peterson says that he would like to he able to arrange for a selected Iraqi irrigation engineer to visit India to see some of the major irrigation works which have heen constructed there and the immense areas which through them have heen brought under cultivation and colonised. We have heen going into the whole question of facilitating Iraqi visits of this sort. We see no prospect ourselves of finding money on the Foreign Office vote for paying for visits even to this country, let alone to India. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, much the most hopeful way of arranging for visits without expense to the Iraqi Government would seem to he through the British Council/ J.P. Gihson, Esq. KECD. PS; 10 DEC ' INDIA ,,- — w • 33 oouncilj iDut I fear thati the Council's activities cannot possibly he extended to include arranging for visits to India* No doubt the Government of India too would find it difficult, if not impossible, to invite the Iraqis to send an expert irrigation engineer, free of all cost to Iraq, to come and see the great work that has been done in India in the way of irrigation* V/e are, however, most anxious that everything possible should be done to convince the Iraqi authorities that, in view of the Anglo-Iraqi alliance, we are prepared to go out of our way to help and advise them on their current problems* And I may say that we have already been able to go very far towards meeting the majority of Peterson’s recommendations. V/e should be very grateful therefore if you will explain the position to the Government of India and find out from them whether, supposing the Iraqis were prepared to send someone at their own expense, they would give him a friendly welcome and arrange for him to be shown some really big irrigation schemes. No doubt it would hardly be possible for the Embassy to invite the Iraqi Government to send one of the irrigation/34 &gt;N irrigation officials to India unless the expenses of the trip were to he met from British funds, hut it might well he possible for them to arrange matters, possibly through one of the British advisers in the competent Iraqi Ministry, if they found that the Iraqis would like to send someone at their own expense, and knew that the Government of India would he ready to do what they could to make the visit a real success.35 P.Z. 6295/38. EXTRACT PROM LETTER PROM SIR M. PETERSON TO VISCOUNT HALIFAX, DATED JULY 12, 1938./ 15. It is appropriate here to refer to the great success of the arrangements made earlier in the year for the visit to the United Kingdom of the Director-General of Training and Instruction in the Ministry of Education. It is not too much to say that that visit and its satisfactory results have profoundly changed the attitude of the Ministry of Education. Trust has largely replaced suspicion, and an appreciation of an eagerness for British education has grown up where American theories once held the field. I think the moral is that the same methods could with much advantage be applied to other departments. I should like, for example, to be able to arrange for a selected Iraqi irrigation engineer to visit India to see some of the major irrigation works which have been constructed there and the immense areas which through them have been brought under cultivation and colonised. More frequent visits to the United Kingdom by the Iraqi army chiefs might also do much to improve the temper of the Ministry of Defence.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001b6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2895</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001b6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2895</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/32 'Iraq.
