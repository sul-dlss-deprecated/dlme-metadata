U/vtcXlS FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. H.K. Sheikh Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifah had been in poor health for some time when on the 20th February he died,as the result of a stroke on the 17th February. In anticipation of a disputed succession on his death,Sheikh Hamad had signed a document nominating nis eldest son Sheikh Salman bin Hamad as his successor. This paper was keot secret and deposited with the Local Branch of the Eastern Bank tP*£.2019/40)• .Tact Sheikh Salman's accession was tH*A***b** *oy his two uncles and potential rivals, and he was unanimously selected by the Al Khalifah family, aest theUnecisioi^^onfirmed by the production of Sheikh Hamad's testament, (in paragraph 12 of his Report the Political Agent discusses the value of this testament which was helpful as it happened, but might have been a very serious embarrassment had it run counter to the choice of the Al KhalifaK family. This view is endorsed by the Political Resident in paragraph 4 his covering letter). On February 21st the Political Agent called on SheikhS Salman, Mohammad, Abdullan and Rashid bin Mohammad, father-in-law of the late Ruler. Sheikh Salman gave a most emphatic undertaking that he and his seven brothers would always be friendly and faithful,! to the British Government. He reiterated this,the next morning,when he visited the Political Agent to inform him that he had been unanimously^ selected to succeed his father.

EXT 2963 s ^ 1942 Your Highness, 1 have been entrusted by His excellency the Viceroy of Incia with the important and happy duty of presenting on His Excellency^ behalf a Kharita of congratulations and good wishes to Your Highness on the occasion of your accession as Ruler of Bahrain. The performance of this task is mace all the more pleasurable by the tact of Your Highness* prompt and unanimous selection by your family to succeed, in accordance with his own expressed wishes, your late lamented father His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin isa, Knight Commander of the Indian Empire, Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, and by the knowledge that Your Highness* selection has been so heartily welcomed by all classes of your subjects. indeed I must congratulate tne whole Al Khalifa on tne wisdom and public spirit shown by them in ceciding, so rapidly and with such unanimity, to accept Your Highness as Head of the Eamily. Your Highness is well qualified to bear tne heavy duties which have thus fallen to your lot. Your Highness’ sympathy with, and interest in, all classes of your subjects is well- known and all are happy to have a Ruler who, they are satisfied, will place the welfare at his State oeiore all otner objects. The part Your Highness has long playec in the acministration of the State has given you a wide knowledge of IoclI affairs while your studies of Geography and History have made you conversant with world politics. Bahrain is indeed fortunate to have a Ruler of such wiscom and experience and so well equipped for his task. The importance of Bahrain has recently increased greatly / partly-2 partly on account of the wise acmini strati on of His late Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa and partly owing to the discovery oi oil and the establishment ol air comniun i cat ions • Bahrain has now ample revenues and as an important link in tiie chain oi inter national communications is a name well-known in all quarters of the globe. Given peaceful conditions i am sure she can look forward to further progress and increased prosperity under lour Highness* able rule. 1 am particularly happy in the assurance given by Your Highness to Hie Political Agent that you will preserve the ties of friendship that have for so long linked the Al Khalifa ana Bahrain with the British Government. This friendship is of the greatest value to both parties. Bahrain derives from it a position of security which she might otherwise find it difficult to maintain while the British Government have reason to be thankful to Bahrain for her willing co-operation in the war effort. His late Highness was a most consistent and loyal supporter of the British cause and Your Highness during the short time you have been Ruler has already shown yourself willing to do everything in your power to contribute to the victory of Great Britain and her Allies. v*e meet to-day under the shadow of the ftorld V.ar, and Your Highness has wisely decided that in view of the anxieties which beset us this auspicious ceremony should be shorn of the festivities which would otherwise have accompanied it. Let us pray tnat God may grant Great Britain and her Allies speedy victory, so that the present troubles which threaten to engulf the whole world may quickly pass away and lour Highness may be able to celebrate the first anniversary of your accession with fitting pomp and lestivity amid the blessings of peace. I end by praying God to grant Your Highness long life and prosperity as Ruler of Bahrain. Sfay the State continue to flourish and progress under your wise guidance and may the / long- 1-3- long-stanairifo Irienaship between tUe Al Khalifa and the British Government continue. loxx may rest assured of the personal support and affection of myself and the Political Agent and that we will do everything in our power to mjie it easy for you to carry out the heavy responsibilities which lie Del ore you.

Bahrain Succession.Confidential Ko.C/333 of 1942. Office of the Political HeaiCent in the Persian Qulf f Camp,Bahrain. Dated the 26th March, 1242. Prom - The Fon f hle Lieut.-Colonel W.fi.Hay, C.T#^*t Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affaire Department, New Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report I have received from the Political Agent, Jahr^ in, on the death of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hafaad bin ’Isa al i&lt;halifah, K.C.I#E* ,C.S. I., Ruler of Bahrain, and the succession of his eldest son, His Highness Shai'ich Salman bin 1 araad al Chalifah. 2 . Xt is extremely satisfactory that Shailch Salman’s succession toofc place so smoothly. Although Mr.'Wakefield was confronted with no particular difficulties I consider he handled the situation arising out of the death of Shaikh Hamad with tact and ability. The influence of lir.Belgr&amp;ve who has for so long guided the affairs of the Bahrain Government was also undoubtedly a stabilising factor. 3. The new Ruler of Bahrain is 47 years old# he is abstemious in his habits, though unlike his father he smokes, and conservative in his general behaviour - though by no means so old-fashioned as his father. He has the reputation of being somewhat close-fisted and is unlikely to continue Shaikh Hamad’s excessive liberality towards the Bedouin, which is all to the good. He is already selling off and giving away many of the useless camels and ponies which his father received in exchange for motor cars and other costly gifts. He can raad and writa V Arabic, is a student of geography and takes a keen interest in affairs. Fe has a ready flow of conversation and possesses intelligence and ability. Though he has for many years been associated with the affairs of the State as a member of hts / father’sdD r\ -j?- father's Cabinet f and has latterly been President of the Court of Wards and Chairman of the Lfuharraq ilunicipality, he has remained some'what in the backgro^md. He has however slipped very easily into the position of Ruler* seems thoroughly to enjoy his new dignities and I consider it probable that he will take a much more active oart in the direction of hie State's affairs than his father. He is said to be an admirer of leza Shah and to have expressed an opinion that it is necessary at times to take strong measures to stimulate the progress of a backward country. It is I think probable that in due course he will be anxious to c rry out reforms in Bahrein, though it is to be hoped that he will not endeavour to imitate Reza Shah too closely. At present he is respected by all Glasses because of his impartiality and refusal to interfere in people's private affairs. It is dangerous to prophesy but on the whole I am inclined to think that Shaikh Salman should prove a bet ter ' 1 / 3 &lt; ♦vLt - &gt;1 * Ruler than his father though he will never inspirs the same 1 iLU universal affection/ It is possible that his anxiety to assert U his authority may give rise to some difficulties to begin AC) with. ,&gt; 4 . I would call partial lar attention to the concluding paragraph of !lr.Wakefield's report. I agree that it was most useful to have on record all the discussions which t ok ol^oe on the subject of the succession, but in the event the secret testament of Shaikh Hamad had no influence on the course of events, and as Ur.Wakefield points out it might have proved a most serious embarrassment. I am inclined to thii k that any secret declaration of this sort should be avoided in future. If a Ruler is strong enough to appoint a successor tn his life time and to obtain his family's consent to the appointment, well and good - otherwise it i. better, though no doubt leas conven ient for us, to leave the question of succession to he settled by a family conclave after the Ruler's death. In accordance / withof) -3- with the usual Artib custom* 5* Ghailch Salman Is a •good life* and it Is to be hoped that it will be many years before it is necessary to consider the succession question again in detail. The position may however be briefly stated. He has three sons of whom the eldest | is only ten years old. It seems unlikely that any of these will be fit to succeed as THiler for at l*aat fifteen years. He has two surviv ng uncles Shaikhs ^fuhamma and Abdulla, the latter of whom was considered as his most likely rival for the succes sion on the death of hia father. Both these uncles are now of advanced age and I am inclined to think have more or less faded out of the picture. Should Shaikh Salman die before one of his sens has emerged as e leading personality I should ex &gt;ect the family to select one of hie brothers as his successor. These are seven in number and I should expect the choice to fall on Duaij or Abdulla, probably the former. PuaiJ is the nore popular and has succeeded the Shaikh as President of the Court of Wards. Abdulla is well educated and speaks English freely* he has t*; ten Shaikh Salman’s place as Chairman of the 4 uharraq Ifunicip&amp;lity. A family tree is appended. 6 .

Prom To S.B•Wakefield Eaqulre, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain* The Honourable the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain* Sir, I have the honour to submit a report on the death of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa al Khali?ah, K*C*I*S*, C*S*I*, Ruler of Bahrain, and the succession of his eldest son, His Highness Shaikh Salman bln Hamad al Khallfah* 2* The last occasion on which I saw Shaikh Hamad was on the 16th February, 1942, when a ceremonial parade of the State Farces was held In front of the Palace at Manamah to mark the tenth anniversary of his accession* had I had alsc^an Interview with the Shaikh on the 15th February when we discussed In some detail the war situ ation, with particular reference to the Impending fall of Singapore* It seemed to me, on both these occasions, that His Highness 1 general health was not good and that the Improvement which followed his hawking expedition In Saudi Arabia earlier In the winter had not been maintained*- 2 - \ 3* On the 17th February 1 left Bahrain by air for a weak* a tour of the Truelal Coaat. On the afternoon of February 19th, on my return to Sharjah from Abu Dhabi, I found awaiting mm a telegram from ?4r•Jackson, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, Informing me that Shaikh Hamad had had a stroke on February 17th and had not, by the afternoon of February 18th (when the telegrams was des patched), recovered consciousness. By the courtesy of Squadron Leader Hawaii, Officer Com;landing, Station, Sharjah, I was enabled to return to Bahrain on the morning of February 20th In a service aeroplane; and I actually arrived at Bahrain about a quarter of an hour after His Highness Shaikh Hamad had died. 4. It appears that after the ceremonial parade on the afternoon of February 16th His Highness Shaikh Hamad had driven out to his country house at Kumalth/*. At 8.30 p«a« on the following day, February 17th, he had a stroke while he was saying his prayers, and fell on his side, unconscious. Hear relatlvas and doctors were at once summoned. Dr.snow (State Medical Officer), Dr. Holmes (Residency Surgeon) and Dr. Harrison (American Mission) attended the Shaikh and one of them was always with him until, without having re covered consciousness, he eventually died at about 12.15 p.m. on Friday, February 20th. At the time of his death only Dr. Holmes and one or two servant^ were present. Members of the family had left the house a little earlier to take their mid-day meal. The funeral was held the same after noon, the bur la), taking place at the cemetery at Kafe* • Shaikh Hamad* a age at the time of hla death in not knov&lt;n exactly. Zt Is believed, however, that he was In his ssventlsth year. Those who sent telegrams of condolencs Included the Hinge of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Hsr Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Bari of Athlone, His Majesty’s Government and His Ibccellency the Viceroy.5« It had been expected that when Shaikh Hamad died the succession would be disputed* In fact f however, Shaikh r&gt;alraan assumed the reins of government with the unanimous consent of the Khallfah family and without objection on the part of any class of his subjects* The transition from one rule to another has, indeed, been so peaceful, so free from the vllsploys of partisan spirit which normally mark such occasions in Arab Sheikhdoms, that It may be of Interest to r coni In some detail the steps by which It was accom plished* 6 * On the evening of February 19th, while Shaikh Hamad was still lying in a state of c oma, Shaikh Abdullah paid a private visit to Shaikh Salman* Shaikh Abdullah, it will be recoiled, is the younger of Shaikh Salman*a two uncles and had been commonly regarded as Sheikh Sal man* s most dangerous rival In a disputed succession* 3haikh Abdullah, In the course of his Interview with Shaikh Salmn, urged that he, Shaikh Bair,an, should succeed Bhalkh Hamad If Shaikh Hamad did not reedver from his stroke; and he promised hia full support to Sheikh Hainan* After discussion Shaikh Salmn agreed to take hie father’s place on condition that all the family supported him* It Is not known whether Shaikh Mohammad (Shaikh Salman* e elder uncle) was privy to Shaikh Abdullah’s overtures before they were made, but immediately after Shaikh Hamad*a death, when the family collected nt Fumaitha, Shaikhs Ifohammnd and Abdullah took Shaikh Salman aside and told him that they regarded him as the natural successor of Shaikh Hamad and that they would sup ort him loyally In the same way as they had supported hls father* The three Shaikhs then rejoined the other members of the family who were present and Shaikh Mohammad, announcing that Shaikh Salman would succeed Shaikh Hamad, asked whether any one had any objection/ 8. Th. members of the family 9 seeing th^t Shaikh Salman had the support of his two uncles (the moat influential and respected members of the Xhelifah family), unanimously signified their acceptance of Sheikh Salman, 7, In the lata afternoon of February 20th MT •Balgrave Informed me that the Khallfah family had chosen Shaikh Salman to succeed his father, 1 did not know at th«t time vrhat part Shaikh Abdullah had played in the a3loction of Shaikh Salman, nor had 1 reason to suppose that aqy of the Khallfah family knew the contents of Shaikh ?Iajnad's testament appoint ing Shaikh Salman to succeed him. It seemed to me that Shaikh Kalman had already gone a considerable way to estab lishing himself in his father* a place and that, If the con tents of Shaikh Hamad's testament were kno n, Shaikh Halman'a position would become secure against any possible rival, I therefore asked IiJr,Belgrava to secure Shaikh Hamad's testa ment from the local branch of the Eastern rank, where it was lying in safe custody, and to take it to Shaikh 3alraan imfiiodiately, Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining from the Bank the sealed envelope containing shaikh Hamad's testament but eventually Mr,3elgrave secured the envelope and, having arranged a private interview with Shaikh Salman, delivered it to him at 8 Shaikh Salman was both pleased and relieved to find that his father had appointed him his successor. He said that neither he nor oiy other •ember of the family had any knowledge of Shaikh Hamad's testament although one or two people knew that Shaikh Hamad had on one occasion signed an Important document. !?e said that he would try to get hla two uncles to endorse the document in token of their acceptance of its contents and that he would al&amp;o like it to be signed by the Political Agent,5 8 * On the norning of February 21at I paid the customary visits of condolence, first to Shaikh Salman, then to Shaikh Mohammad, then to Shaikh Abdullah, and finally to Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad, father-in-law of the late Muler, The order in which these visits ware paid was taken, no doubt, to be an indication of the altitude which His Majesty’s Government were likely to adopt towards the succesjlon: But in ray conversations with the Shaikhs I strictly avoided any reference, direct or indirect, to that subject. then I arrived at Hafa’ to call on Shaikh Saltuan ho introduced me to his sevsn brothers. In the course of our conversation, which waa mostly about Shaikh Hamad and his many fine qualities, Shaikh SaJb&amp;m expressed his determination to follow as cloaoly as poaaible in his father’s footsteps. In par ticular, and in an emphatic manner, he gsve an under taking that he and his brother® would always be friendly and faithful to the British Government. During my call on Shaikh Moha/uaad he told me that he would give his full support to Shaikh Salman whom he now regarded as the Herd of the Family. Neither Shaikh Abdullah nor Shaikh Kashid made any reference to Shaikh Salman and hio new position. 9. On the aornii% of the 22nd February shaikh Sal man and his two uncles, accompanied by Mr.Bclgrcve, came to aee me at the Agency. I mat Shaikh nsLiisn, who walkeu ahead of the others, at the place at which the Political Agent normally receives the Fuler of Bahraini but in ny conversation I avoided the use of honocrifics to which only the Ruler of Bahrain is entitled. ^fter the usual preliminary courtesies Shaikh Salman gave me formal intimation that his fanily had unanimously selected him to succeed hla father. Shaikhs Mohamad and Abdullah / confirmed6 confirmed this and added that nowhere in Bahrain, either among the Khallfah family or among the populace, was there a single dissentient voice* Shaikh Salman then informed me that he had set before himself three main objectives* These were t~ (1) Loyally to preserve the existing ties of friendship with the British Government; (2) To respect the rights both of members of his family and of his individual subjects; and (3) To promote the public welfare hy all means in hi* power. He expressed his determination to be loyal to the British connection and to implement all undertakings given by the previous Rulers of Bahrain; and he spontaneously offered to be guided by any advice which the Political Agent might ten der to him* In reply I expressed pleasure at hearing his declaration of friendship and loyalty; and I promised that, for «y part, 1 would always deal with him frankly and openly eo that nothing would be hidden between us and there could never be any misunderstanding; and I further told him that I would report at once to the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf the sentiments that he had expressed to me and the fact that hie succession had the unanimous support of his family and people* Before taking his leave Shaikh Salman told me in detail of his father’s last hours, and praised the devotion of the doctors who attended him* He also ex- \i pressed his gratitude for the help which Mr.Belgravs had given to his father in the past and was new giving to him* 10* In the afternoon of February 22nd Shaikh Salman issued s proclamation announcing that he had '’taken over the rule of Bahrain” in accordance with the wish and behest of / Shaikh \C 3 Shaikh Haattd and with the apprcnral of his uncles f hia brothers / end of his tribe* The Proclamation contained the foilwing word * I shall continue to strengthen the ;^roweA ties with the British Empire* and shrll always maintain its friend ship , ** Mr* Belgrove conoulte t me unofficially before the proclamation was Issued* To delay its Issue would have been to promote locally speculation and disquiett if, on tho other hand, I were officially to authorise its ier?ue I should be anticipating the decision of Bis Majesty’s Government. I decided that, on the whole, the issue of the proclamation was justified .since Kis Majesty*s Govemnent were definitely opposed to official interference in the succession - though, of course, they could with©Id recognition of a successor if they so wished: Moreover, there was reason to believe that Bis Majesty’s Govemnsnt would welcome Bheikh Salman as Buler of Bahrain and would, therefore, welcome any step which helped to establish him firmly and peaceably in that position* I therefore suggested to Mr*Belgreve that the proclamation should be Issued without reference to me. 11* The formal recognition of His Majesty’s Government end the Govern; ent of India to the rmocoanion of Bis Highnes s Shaikh Balm on was communicated to the Ghslkh in a letter which I personally handed to him on the 1st of tfnreh, 1342* TTia Highness was very pleased at the prompt recognition of Ms succession and expressed the hooe, which I cordially recipro cated, that I should always be the bearer of good tidings. 12. It i^ satisfactory that lhaikh Homed•s successor has established himolef as Tiuler of Bahrain without the active intervention of the Political Agent. Ths only positive steps which I took to assist the course of events were my remiest to Mr.Belgrsve that he should take immediate steps / to- 8 - to place Shaikh Hamad*s testament in Shaikh Salman*s hands, and ap unofficial concurrence In the Issue of .shaikh Salman* s proclamation of February 22nd. I should like to place on record, however, that the responsibilities which devolved on me when Shaikh Hamad died ware greatly lightened by the knowledge of the policy to be pursued in such a contingency which I derived from study of the records of 1938 and 1939 when. It win be recalled, the question of a successor to Shaikh Hamad was discussed from every angle. As matters have turned out Shaikh Hamad’s testament appointing his eldest son to succeed him has proved fortunate as the terms of that testament have added the sanction of Shaikh Hamad's authority to the Independent choice of the Khallfoh family; and the testament which Ur. Weightoan was at such pains to secure from Shaikh Hamad has proved an Invaluable asset to Shaikh Salman in securing general assent to his succession. In slightly altered circumstances, however, Shaikh Hamad*s testament (the secret of which was almost too well kept) might have proved an embarrassment. If, for instance, at the Interview between Shaikhs Salman am Abdullah before Shaikh Hamad died, the decision had been that shaikh /bdullah should succeed, It would have been very difficult for the Political Agent to know whether to withhold the testament - and be guilty of duplicity - or produce it - anri create Strife. A similar difficulty would have arisen if, events occurring as they have occurred. Shaikh Hamad*s testament had been in favour of Shaikh Abdullah. The factor which was not, and could not have been, foreseen was that the question of the succession would virtually oe decided before Shaikh Earned wrs dead, and, therefore, before the contents of his testament could be known. Happily, however, the / secret(3 * - 9 - secret choice of Sheikh Hasted and the public choice of the Khelifeh fwily coincided. The clash of equally balanced claims was avoided, and Shaikh Salmon, without opposition or dispute, ruled in his father's ate£*d. T havo the honoijr to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

His Late Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa al Khalifah. K.C.I.E., C.S.I. ( i) The anniversary of the accession of Shaikh Hamad was celebrated on the 16th February. A ceremonial parade of the State forces was held in front of the palace. Shaikh Hamad attended the parade but, as he was having trouble with a rheumatic leg, remained seated throughout. I also attended the parade and noticed that Shaikh Hamad looked tired and drawn. After the parade the Shaikh went to stay at his country house at Rumaitha. (ii) At about 8.30 p.m. on the 17th February Shaikh Hamad has a stroke while saying his prayers. He fell on his side, unconscious, and never sub sequently recovered consciousness. Dr. Snow (State Medical Officer), Dr. Holmes (Residency Surgeon) and Dr. Harrison (American Mission) attended Shaikh Hamad and one of them was always with him until he died at about 12.15 p.m. on Friday, February 20th. At the time of his death only Dr. Holmes and one or two servants were present. Members of the family had left the house to take their midday meal. Shaikh Hamad was buried in the cemetery at Rafa 1 on the afternoon of the 20th February. No public notice of the funeral was given and several close relatives were unable to be present. Shaikh Hamad f s death at the age of about 70 occasioned general and sincere grief. Not only had he proved a true friend of the British Government but he had always given a friendly and sympathetic hearing to all who came to him with their troubles. Messages of condolence were received from all quarters of the globe.Ext.1978/42. SECRET, Extract from Intelligence Summary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period 16th to 28th February 1942 TTo. 4 of 1942. 24. His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al TChalifah . It was generally supposed that when Shaikh Hamad died the succession would be disputed. Many people expected that Shaikh Abdullah bin ! Isa, the younger of Shaikh Hamad’s two surviving brothers, would seize the power; many expected that Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, the late Ruler’s eldest son, would command the greatest support; some regarded one or other of Shaikh Salman’s younger brothers as poten tially successful claimants; while among the Baharina there were not a few who expected the British Govern ment, on the death of Shaikh Hemad, to assume direct control of the Bahrain Administration. Few expected the peaceful transition from one rule to another which has in fact taken place. On the evening prior to Shaikh Hamad’s death, Shaikh Abdullah paid a private visit to Shaikh Salman and promised to support him if, in the event of Shaikh Hamad dying, he would agree to succeed his father. After discussion Shaikh Salman agreed to take his father’s place as Ruler of Bahrain if all the family would support him. Shaikh Mohammad bin ’Isa must have been told of the arrangement for, immediately after Shaikh Hamad’s death, when members of the family assembled at Rumaitha, he announced that Shaikh Salman would succeed Shaikh Hamad and asked whether anyone had any objection. The members of the family present, seeing that Shaikh Salman had the support of his two uncles, gave their unanimous consent to his succession. Meanwhile there was lying in the vaults of the Bahrain branch of the Eastern Bank a deed signed by Shaikh Hamad appointing Shaikh Salman as his successor. The contents of this deed were unknown to any member of the Al Khalifah; nor did the Al Khalifah know that Shaikh Hamad had in fact appointed a successor/successor. This deed was 'baleen 'to Shaikh Salman on the evening of February 20th, Knowledge of its contents soon became general and helped greatly to consolidate Shaikh Salman^ new position. On February 21st I paid condolence visits to Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, Shaikh Mohammad bin ! Isa, Shaikh Abdullah bin ’Isa and Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad (father-in-law of Shaikh Hamad). On the morning of February 22nd Shaikh Salman visited me accompanied by his two uncles and Mr. Belgreve, Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Shaikh Salman informed me that his succession to his father had the unanimous approval of his family and subjects; and he assured me in unequivocal terms of his friendship for the British Government and of his determination to respect existing treaties and engagements. In the afternoon of February ‘22nd Shaikh Salman issued a proclamation announcing that, in conformity with the behest of his late father and with the unanimous consent of his uncles, his brothers and all his tribe , he had become the Ruler of Bahrain. The proclamation contained the following words :- ”1 shall continue to strengthen the proved ties with the British Empire and shall always maintain its friendship'. The succession of Shaikh Salman has been accepted by all sections of the Bahrain community. Shaikhs Mohammad and Abdullah intend to be the 'powers behind the throne'. Shaikh Salman is not popular with his younger brothers but none of them is in a position to dispute his authority. Other members of the Khalifah family accept Shaikh Salman as being the right and proper successor to Shaikh Hamad. The Baharina are relieved that Shaikh Salman, rather than Shaikh Mohammad or Shaikh Abdullah, has become the Ruler; and only the young bloods of the town (who are anti-British in sentiment) are disgruntled about Shaikh Salman’s succession. As Shaikh Salman has asked Mr. Belgrave to remain as Adviser to the Bahrein Government, violent upheavals in the administration are unlikely . I t . is possible, however, that friction will be caused inside the/the Khalifah family when the thorny problem of dividing Shaikh Hamad 1 s large estate is taken up. Shaikh Salman 1 s succession has been formally recognised by His Majesty 1 s Government and the Government of India.t r Dear Lumby, Thank you so much for your letter of the 27th February 1942 and for so kindly having my message transmitted to Bahrain, 1 am very glad to hear that the succession has gone off without trouble. 1 enclose/ a cheque for £2/18/4.

He was a staunch friend and ally and his loss will be grievously felt both by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, while his people will mourn a Ruler whose deep fatherly affection for them was an outstanding trait in a loveable character. Shaikh Hamad's death will be a sad blow to his fellow Arab Rulers who held him in uniform esteem and affection, and to none more than His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud whose honoured guest Shaikh Hamad was only a few weeks ago. Shaikh Hamad bin Isa had ruled Bahrain for 18 years, first as his father’s Deputy and afterwards as Shaikh of Bahrain in his own right. Under his rule Bahrain developed in a manner which was a source of great and legitimate pride not only to Shaikh Hamad himself but equally to his subjects and his innumerable friends. The discovery of oil led to a great access of prosperity in Bahrain and Shaikh Hamad, whose innate generosity was known from end to end of the Persian Gulf, made it his life's task to ensure that his people benefited to the full. Humanitarian activities flourished, education was developed in keeping with Arab ideals, fine hospitals were built, determined and successful efforts were made to eradicate the curse of malaria which has brooded for generations over Bahrain, dreams of a pure water supply in Manama, the capital, were brought with e deepest regret. Shaikh Hamad was a fine example of the Arab Shaikhly tradition whose genuine human qualities, typified by his dignified HUMANITARIAN ACTIVITIESt(S.real - 2 - t(S,feality, and only recently, in spite of difficulties resulting from the war, the last link Gorged in joining Moharraq to the * —~ — ^ main island by a fine causeway and bridge. In all these activities Shaikh Hamad bin Isa played a part that might be expect-ed fi*om one whose character was marked by simplicity and love for his fellow mem VISIT TO INDIA IN 1939 Shaikh Hamad visited India on more than one occasion, and most recently in 1939 when he went to Simla to visit H.S. the Viceroy, and when his fine bearing and patent qualities made a deep impression on all who met him. Shaikh Hamad bin Isa set a magnificent example of steadfast loyalty to the Allied cause. His gifts were many and generous and his co-operation ungrudging. Some day it will be possible to relate the whole story but now it can only be said that his both _in^Hngland and generous aid earned profound admiration and gratitude/ in India. A rare personality is lost to the Arab world; yet his memory will be enshrined not only in his own beloved Bahrain but wherever an example of simple kindliness finds honour and grateful recognition in this world. THE VICEROY’S CONDOLENCES The Forbign Secretary has sent the following message to the Political Agent, Bahrain:- 'Please convey to the A1 Khalifa family, His Excellency th£ Viceroy's sincere condolences and sense of bereavement at the loss of a staunch friend and ally.

The Foreign Office have agreed orally that Salman should be recognised. In the attached file the question of the Bahrein succession is discussed from P.2.1948/40 (flagged) upwards . The greater part of the correspondence is irrelevant since it deals with (a) what would happen if Sheikh Hamad died without nominating his successor; (b) if he did nominate his successor, whether his choice should be recognised by H.M.G. before his death. In the event, however, Sheikh Hamad did nominate Sheikh Salman, though with the utmost precautions to preserve secrecy, early in 1940; and he did not refer£the question of recognition by H.M.G. Jor the Government of India. The minute at P.Z.2019/40 shows how matters stood before his death, and quotes the only two references we have to the character of Salman. Our letter to the F.O. of February 23rd below proposed that our telegram on the question of recognition should be addressed to the Government of India;, but now that we have received a telegram from the lu. latter we can address the Political Resident direct, 4 repeating to the Government of India and Bahrein. Our ^ , 1 letter to the F.O. also suggested that the recognition Sa i man should be dependent upon his giving an undertaking that he would honour the treaties and engagements of his predecessors; but the concluding passage of the Political Resident’s telegram No. T/21, although this has been received incomplete, seems to make any such stipulation unnecessary. The Political Resident’s telegram to the Government of India No. T/l4 of February 22nd, suggesting a message of condolence from the King,crossed our telegram/telegram No, 3363 of February 23rd r which asked the Political Resident, if he and the Government of India saw no objection, to instruct the Political Agent at Bahrein to convey to Sheikh Salman a suitable message of condolence from H.M.G.

Sheikh Hamad v/as from tne first so strong a supporter of the Allied cause that it seems more appropriate that in hisnag e^th e message should come( if not from the King) from H.L.G.;^since his most notable contribution to the war effort, his gift of £30,000, was made to 'the British Government' and went to the treasury.

SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE The Political Agent, Bahrein, in his lettfer to the Political Resident (P.Z. 2019/40j, reports the settlement of the Bahrein succession. The Sheik-h, after some discussion of details with the Political Agent^called a private meeting and entered the name of his eldest son, Salman, on a document which had 'been drawn up on the lines of the Sheikh Isa’s succession document, his predecessor. His Highness would not consent to a public act of nomination and has observed the utmost secrecy in the matter, only communicating the name to a chosen few, including the Political Agent. The witnesses to the document were not allowed to know the nature of it, and it was afterwards deposited in the/the Eastern Bank. It is satisfactory that the matter has been settled and that the Sheikh has not raised the question of official recognition being accorded to his nominee. It is interesting to note that Sir T.

No. S.v/. 100. Slet^Fehruary 19'40^ JL - 2'j i j i 1940 J My dear Prior, You will remember that we had some diecussion in Kuwait about the Bahrain Succession and that you sent me a copy of a document by which Shaikh Isa bin Ali nominated Shaikh Hamad as heir to the Shaikhdom of Bahrain some forty-two years ago. 2. Soon after my return here I found an opportunity to enquire from Shaikh Hamad whether he had given any further thought to the idea that he should nominate his successor. He told me that he had been thinking it over and had come to the conclusion that he should nominate his eldest son Salman. There were ample preced- -ents - of excellent quality - for the nomination of an eldest son to the succession . and what did I think ? Katurally I applauded his views and said ( in effect ) that while one must recognise the wiedom in Arab non-insistence on primogeniture, one must equally recognise that an eldest son should only be excluded if he is patently unfit for the succession and cannot be expected to maintain the position of Ruler. This comment according with His Highness* own views, he announced to me his final decision to nominate Shaikh Salman. 3. The next question concerned the manner and form of the nomination. His Highness was insistent that it should be done secretly. In spite of the many advantages of a public act of nomination it was, of course, useless to argue the pdint, and I accordiifty suggested the procedure which I had mentioned to you in Kuwait s namely that a document be written out by a trustworthy person, the name of the nominee being left blank ; that the principal Sunni $adhi and the Shia 'Appeal' Q,adhi and Shaikh Rashid ( His Highness* The Hon*ble Lieut-Col. G.G.Prior, C.I.K., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BahrainHighness* father -in-law ) he summoned to a privat^»a«44»tj - from a distance - they would see His Highness write certain words with his own hand in a document, hut would not he told what the document or the words were ; that the document should then he folded until only His Highness* seal was visible and that they should then sign as v/itnesses. I thought Shaikh Isa’s document v/ould do very well with one amendment ( the exclusion of the reference to the requests made from time to time hy his subjects to Shaikh lea to make a nomination ) and with the requisite change of names. His Highness was delighted with these suggestions and they were carried a out in a room in the Adviserate on Friday February the 16th. Friday was selected as there would he no one about. His Highness wrote the words 'Waladi Salman bin Hamad” clearly and firmly in the J appropriate place, signed his full name at the head of the document and attached his seal both above and below it. The witnesses performed their task in an atmostphere redolent with unsatisfied curiosity ( I believe they think they were witnessing an ordinary property will ) and were warned not to mention the matter to a soul. At the menent, apart from His Highness and myself, Belgrave and Abdulla bin Jabr, His Highness* Confidential Secretary, are the only persons in Bahrain who know the name of the successor. 4. The document has been deposited in the Eastern Bank, and the only - incomplete - copy is in my possession. This copy I have completed in pencil, in English, and have locked it away for future reference if necessary. Photographs were taken as each person signed and will be attached to the original document if they are successful. They are not being printed and develpped in Bahrain. Yours sincerely. Sd/. H.

Cf. letter from the Pol. Resident in the Persian Gulf to Govt, of India, Forei^ Dept. No. 124, dated D.12.1697. Cf. letter from the Pol. Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 37&lt; .iU, dated 13.6 #1898, with enclosures. — ibid — 2. In 1697 Shaikh £sa, father of the present Shaikh, sent his son to interview the Political Resident with the object of securing his recognition by the British Government. The Resident informed Sheikh B&amp;mad thst it would be necessary for his father to address him stating what his wishes were and that the shaikh’s propo sals would be forwarded for the consideration of Government if sufficiently strong reasons weie urged. On 7th February 1898 Shaikh iiea wrote to the Resident enclosing a copy of his will in which he declared the appointment of his son as heir apparent. The will was attested by 44 of the leading men of Bahrain. Before referring the matter to the Government of India the Political Resident asked for the views of local officers with particular regard to the custom and practice obtaining among /rab tribes relative to succession to Shaikhship and the probable reaction of the people of Bahrain and the surrounding tribes to a recognition by us of Shaikh Hamad. The general view appeared to be that whilst there was no recognised rule governing succession which in many cases was determined by financial and other considerations and by the approval of the elders of the tribe^, it was usual for the Shaikh’s nominee to be regarded as his successor and particularly so in the case of tribes dependent on, or tributory to, another power for its peaceful eiistence. Aa Bahrain was regarded generally as a British protectorate, it was anticipated •••Cf. letter from the Jrol. Resident in Persian Gulf No. 37dated 13.6.1898. * No. 194 of 1698. anticipated that Government’s support of :haikh Ramad's claims to w,haikhship would not only be viewed favourably but would also onsure a peaceful succession and increase our influence without augmenting our responsibilities. 3. In recommending the Shaikh’s request to the Government of India, the Political Resident expressed the» opinion'that tha time has coma to take a more decided position in Bahrain than we have hitherto done, end that the treaty engagements entered into between the British Government and the shaikhs of Bahrain, followed by more recent closer relations, appear tc justify an intimation by the British Government that the status of Bahrain towards the Government of India is identical with that of protected Native States in India'. It was argued that if this was done the recognition of Shaikh Hamad would merely follow prece dent often adopted in India.. Further reasons urged were that the succession was approved by many of the elders of the tribes, a peaceful succession without the inevitable family quarrels which ensue on the demise of a Muharmiadan ruler; and that recognition would strengthen the position of bhaikh Hamad. Another (and at the time not unimportant) reason mooted was that the recognition would effectually put an end to Turkey’s pretensions in regard to Bahrain. 4. The question was examined by the Government of India and the manner in which it was dealt with is briefly eipl&amp;ined in their despatch to Secretary of . tate. dated the 27th October 1898. It may, however# be mentioned that the matter was fully discussed from the point of view of the constitutional issue raised by #....Cf. Govt* of India's despatch No* 194 dated 27*10.1696. * No. 44. Cf. Lettei from the uovt. of India No. 205-K.A.. dated 7.2.1b99. by the Political Resident that ’'a moro decided position in Bahrain* should be taken and that an intimation should be made that the 'statue of Bahrain towards the Government of India is identical with that of protected Native States in India'. It was pointed that the intention was to establish an exclusive Protectorate over Bahrain. The Government of India were not in favour of this suggestion and held that in view of the existing Treaty engagements with Bahrain our position in respect of Bahrain did not stand in need of revision: while it was a maxim of general \ policy to avoid interference in the internal affairs of a Chiefship and particularly in dynastic disputes. | It was, however decided to support the recognition of Shaikh Hamad on the grounds that the weakness of Shaikh I Ssa'o rule had &amp;iven rise in the past to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled branch of his family and that in the event of tne succession remaining undecided \ there might have been rick of disturbances, on the shaikh's death, which would have been detrimental to British interests. 5. The Secretary of State in his despatch dated 16th December 1696 expressed the approval of His Majesty's Government to the proposed reeogiition of Shaikh Hamad. The decision was conveyed to Political Resident on 7th February 1699 and he was told at the same time that, without extending a British protectorate over Bahrain, the Government of India were 'prepared to consider proposals to improve the arrangement for the discharge of local political auties in the island'*3 i - 4 - Cf. from l-ol.

As this was not done official notification to the Jiaikn of the recognition was not madeix until 1901. 7.

Hamilton, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Vide Aitchison’s Treaties, &amp;c (3rd Edition), Vol.X, pa^es 120-121. 40mm The Sheikh of Bahrein has expressed^ a desire that the * Enclosures Nos. 1 and 2. British Government should recognise his eldest iatscttHDC son, Sheikh Hamed, as successor designate to the Chiefship. Lieutenant-Colonel Meade is of opinion tnat it is desirable to take a more decided position in respect to Bahrein: he recommends that we should accede to the Sheikh’s request, and that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to secure control of the customs of Bahrein and to appoint, as our representative in the island, a Political Officer of higher rank than our present Agent. 2. The Chief of Bahrein is bound, under the terms of the Agreement signed on the 22nd December 1880, f to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British with -ut the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots’ in his territory, without similar consent. The Chief is also entitled, under oettain circumstances,® to British support for of the security of hia poaaeaaions, nnd Britiah aubjecta of eyery denomination my reside and carry on lawful trade in Bahrein territories. 3. Under theae circumstances, it does not appear to ua that our position in respect to Bahrein stands in need of revision; while it ia maxim of general policy to avoid interference in the internal affairs of a Chiefahip and particularly in dynastic disputes* The weakneasjof the present Sheikh’s rule has, however, + See despatch from the «iven rise +• .u Government of India, No. o rise + ln ^ 191, dated the 23rd October 1874.past to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled branch of hie family; he has four sons; and, if the succession remains undecided, there may be risk of disturbances, on the Sheikh's death, which would be detrimental to British interests. On the whole therefore, and taking into considerat ion the opinions of tne local officers as recorded in the enclosures to the Political Resident’s letter of the 13th June 1098, we sure disposed, as at present advised, to authorise the reooeinition of Sheikh Hamad as heir to the Chiefship; but, before replying to Liehtenant-Colonel lieade, we desire to learn whetner Her Majesty's Grovernment have any advice or instructions to offer at the present stage.fflSSOTOSDCSML nib No. 163-3 of 1939. 7 ’6^ f- ■ -I..

It shows the trust that Shaikh Hamad reposes in us that, without any prompting from us, in fact perhaps because we did not indulge in any prompting, he has asked our advice on the important matter of appointing a successor. 3. I agree generally with .Veightman’s views. Shaikh Hamad 1 s declared intention of consulting us about the actual individual to be nominated as his successor is probably prompt ed by a desire, which he will then formulate, that His Majesty’s Groveriment should recognise this successor. This in njy opinion His Majesty’s Government should not do. 4, I suggest that I be authorised to instruct -veightman to inform Shaikh Hamad verbally as follows* (a) His Majesty’s Government are of the opinion that it would be a wise provision for Shaikh H^mad to appoint a successor. (b) should Shaikh Hamad take the further step of consulting us as to the actual individual to be nominated ffeightman should reply that His Majesty’s Government are of the / Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCP5., GSI. ,MVO., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi.the opinion tJmt this ia t of course, entirely a matter for the Shaikh to decide, but presumably the Shaikh’s choice will fall on Shaikh Abdullah bin ’Isa or either of his sons, Shaikh Salman or Shaikh Abdullah. (c) Should Shaikh ISamad ask for the recognition indicated in paragraph 3 above nightman should reply that His Majesty’s Government, while they take note of Shaikh Hamad’s decision, cannot grant this prior recognition since t to do so would be against their general policy concerning succession in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. 5. Should the Shaikh show signs of choosing as his successor an individual other than one of the three mentioned above VTeightman can let me know and I will report further. * 6.

The correspondence related to the question of the succession in Bahrein, and in his letter of the 18th January Fowle advocated, against a proposal of Weightman’s, the view that the choice of a successor, when the succession falls vacant, should be left to the local notables, including the members of the Sheikhly family, without intervention on the part of the Political Agent. Weightman was apparently influenced by his experience in the Indian States, but Fowle's view is based on his much greater knowledge of Arab custom, and the G. of I. agree with him. 2. Until the case arises it is naturally impossible to foresee with certainty that it will be unnecessary to intervene before we accord recognition to a new Ruler in order to secure the peaceful succession of one who can be relied upon to carry out his treaty obligations. But we think that it is valuable to have Fowle’s view as to the method of selection on record, and that^though there is, of course/course, no necessity for arriving at a decision now, in advance of the event, in regard to questions which may arise, when recognition^ we may agree in principle instructions to the contrary) the P.A. should avoid intervening in the actual. . method of selection. . . . inform Fowle on the above lines. , Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

I enclose a copy of a derui-cfficial letter to T eijV t^an, ITo. 908-9 of the 3Ctb DecersTje' 1'27, on the subject of the Bahrain Succession, which explains itself. Shaikh Pamad is not a particularly 'good life', he suffers from diabetes » and there are obvious advantages in considering now before his death what line we should adopt when that event occurs. 2. In his reply, written after consulting '’elgrave, 'eightman confirms that the likely candidates are those mentioned in my letter quoted above, i.e. . (a) Salman, the eldest son of Shaikl Hamad. Jb} Abdullah bin ’Isa, the Shaikh’s brother. Cc) Abdullah, the Shaikh’s youngest son. Put this individual at present has weaker prospects than either (a) or (b). leightman adds as an outside ch ance ^ ^— (d) Yohanr. ed bin’Isa, the Shaikh’s brother. Veightman also confirms my o.ir ion generally of the character of (a) and (b), and reports favourably on 'c) especially if the latter develops as he promises. Briefly, from our point of view there is nothing a^aix.st any one of the three as a successor to Shaikh Hamad. 3. heither Teightman not Belgrave thinks 'that the^e is any very tJ reat danger of disturbance on the supposition that the succession becomes open in the near future - certainly if Abdullah’s star appears to be in t .e ascendant. I confess 1 Ishould not 'be quite so comfortable if Salman looked like succeeding for I should not ex. ect Abdullah to let that 12 l lakhs slide out of his ^rasp without an Effort though I \ believe he is wise and stron^ enough to prevent anythin^ in the nature of rioting, Thether there r;.i 0 ht be a nasty accidarit in the Family is a different matter, thoujh it is noteworthy that the Family has always been singularly free of 'accidents M • Teightman touches on the possibility of ShaikL Eslk. ad nominating either Salmaii or Abdullah as his successor: vV\Y 'Such a nomination should settle the matter since otherwise the scales are fairly even between the two? It is, however, impossible to say which of the two Shaikh Hamad would nomi nate, as both vary in his ^ood books, and it is quite pro bable that he will die without making any nomination since the idea of dyin G has such an effect on him that no one for yea^s has dared to put the subject to him. 5. Tith regard to what part we should play in the succession Teightman writes; 'Officially the decision must ar^d should rest with the A1 Khalifah Family alone and I con sider that we should be prepared openly to assert this posi tion. Let us assume His Highness dies without making any nomination. The Political Agent should at once arrange for a Council of ^e^ency, if one is not already in existence, as there is at present under another name during His High ness’s absence. He should then summon the whole A1 Khalifah ^amily and after a short sermon, in which be will make it clear that His Majesty’s government have no concern with the succession beyond requiring that the nev Shaikh should honour the Treaties and Engagements of his predecessor, he should invite them separately and secretly to inform him whom they wish to nominate as Shaikh. In brief he should arrange a secret ballot, which I believe would be welcome and wc(l£)d certainly be much to everyone’s adva* ta 0 e. TT avin u 'mm &lt; 1 *9 ? * , [iiu O bttAAJt W/' Im \, acuM? Au&lt;CjMirvtvw iv* 1 &gt;w )L«^. ? done so, he should then summon the Family a^ain and arinounce the name of the winner. That, to ray mind, is all that is required, public announcements etcetera being left entirely to tiie Bahrain Administration. I do not recommend that this should be regarded as a hard and fast procedure to be followed in any circumstances. It may conceivably be quite unnecessary, but the Political Agent should be authorised to put some procedure of this sort into operation if he is satisfied after consultation with the Adviser that it will be to the public advantage to do so. It is not essentially different from what has been done in some States in India, and while designed to obviate confusion, it relieves us, I think, of any charge of offensive interference.” 6 . I have given Weightman 1 s opinion as to what line v/e should take as he is the (nan on the spot. I do not, however, agree with all his suggestions. (a) In the first place, according to general Arab custom it is not the Shaikhly Family which elects a new Shaikh, but influential representatives of the whole tribe or community, and though in the special circumstances prevailing in Bahrain the Family have considerably more power and influence than in most Arab centres, nevertheless I do not think it is for us to exclude others from a voice in the election: if the Family can exclude others that is their affair, not ours. (b) If the election of the new Ruler is not likely to be aelayed beyond a few days, - and Arab^s/generally elect a new Shaikh pretty quickly - then no Council of Regency would appear to be necessary. If the election was delayed, then whether such a Council should be formed could be left to be decided at the time.' (c)‘ I do not think that the Political igent should summon the A1 Khalifah Family, as, whatever he said or did not say to them, it would certainly be generally believed that he had tutored them. (d) If the Family of their own accord asked for an interview with the Political Agent, he could not very well refuse to see them, but should content himself with informing them that His Majesty's G-overnment did not wish to interfere in the election of the new Ruler, but that before tney (His Majesty's Government) accorded recognition he (the new Ruler) would be required to undertake that he would honour the Treaties and Engagements of his predecessor. (e) I am afraid that tie 'secret ballot' would have an unfortunate effect as it would certainly be put about by the losing candidate and his party that the Political Agent, who would be the only one to know how each vote was cast, hau rig^ea the election. 7. If th re is any disorder on the death of the present Ruler this an emergency which must be left for the Political Agent to deal with, if time permits in consultation with the Resident, Otherwise, it will be seen that ray views are briefly that the Political Agent should take no action except as indicated in paragraph 6 (d) above. I would be grateful if I coula be informed whether the Government of. India concur. -* I am sending a copy of this letter to Weightman.

Sir nubrey Metcalfe, KCIH., CSI., 1170., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi.Copy Confiuential, D&gt;Q.No&gt;908-3, Bushife, the 30th December, 1937. Could you please refer to correspondence ending with my telegram No.1194 of the 30th December 1937. compelled to accept the invitation from Ibn Saud, ana thus to make a somewhat arduous overland journey in his present state of health. will run risks of not surviving the overlanu journey, and this risk brings to a head a matter which I have had on my mind for some time i.e. what is going to happen when the Shaikh does actually die, either in the course of the next few months, or the next few years? 4. as you know, Araba do not generally recognise primogeniture though they do insist that the successor to a Shaikah must come from the Shaikhly family. Beyond this it is simplify a case of the best man winning;, by getting the strongest party in the State on his aide. Sometimes he succeeds by bloodshed (the famous Liu bar ak, of Kuwait, killed two of his brothers in one night), and sometimes by a mere show of force as in the case of the present Shaikh of Sharjah when he aeposed his relative Khalia. 5. In Bahrain Salman is the eldest son, but is he likely to succeed, or will another member of trie Family probably Abdullah bin ’Isa or the Shaikh’s youngest son, Abdullah, put himself on the throne? And is there likely to be any sort of open strife? 6 . The policy of the Government of India, and of Eis Majesty’s Government, in the Gulf, is for sound reasons, not to recognise beforehand any successor to a Shaikh, ana though we departed from the practice in Qatar it was for the special reason of inducing the Shaikh to give an oil concession in the riJit direction. In Bahrain, however, we have recognised 2 . It is unfortunate tlm,t the Shaik&amp;h has found himself Even if accompanied by a medical attendant the Shaikh nobody ---. . nobody as successor, nor has the Shaikh asked us to do so. I like Abdullah bin ’Isa personally, and on various occasions he has rendered us assistance e. L . in helping Belgrave to acquire the lanu for the naval base, and in connection with the trails it dues negotiations with the Saudi delegation. I seem to remember also Belgrave telling me that he - Abdullah adopted a sensible attitude to the claims of the Bahama to better treatment. Salman, &lt;$n the i other hand, is likely to be more amenable to our influence 1 but would not be 4uch a strong ruler, axid I have a personal predilection for a Sahikh who can stand on his own legs. The young Abdullah I do not know much about. In your reply to my letter please include a short- career and character sketch of these three individuals, with a^es etc. \7hich of these three do you think has the most popular support in Bahrain? I presume there is no other likely candidate? 8 . Bearing the above consiuerations in mind, when the Shaikh does die what part, if any, do you think we ought to play in getting any particular individual made Shaikh? It may well be that we should play no, part at all. 'The best work of a Political Officer is very often what he has left undone”. V/e certainly do not want to pursue the injudicious policy we have adopted in other parts of Asia of setting up a puppet Huler, whom we have then to support on the throne against popular feeling. 9. Please talk the matter over confidentially with Belgrave anu let me have your views as soon as you convenient ly can. I will then write to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government giving my views and getting from them some idea of the line \ e should adopt when the eventuality under consideration occurs.

No.95-N of 28th January 1933, I have the honour to enclose a translation of a # letter of thanks from His Excellency ohaikh Hamad to His Excellency the Viceroy for the Kharita which Eis Excellency was *ind enough to send him. 2. I presented the Kharita to Shaikh Hamad during 'T, my recent visit to Bahrain, at a Dardar held on the ?th instant at which the large number - for Bahrain - of some six hundred people were present. H.K.B. 'Triad', with Captain Crabbe, the Senior Naval Officer, on board, and the Survey ohip H.F.S. 'Ormonde', were both on a visit to Bahrain, while two Flying Boats accompanying Air Commodore Cunningham, Chief of the Staff to the Air Ciiicer Commanding, ’Iraci Command, had flown down frcm -oafehdad on their way to Muscat. Thus some twenty Navul and Boyal Air Force officers were able to be present at the Darbar. Arrangements for this function, which entailed considerable work, were made by Colonel Loch anu 1r. Be 1grave, financial Adviser to the Bahrain Govern men t. 3. I had expected, as indicated in my letter No. 964-o oi A2nd December last, that the presentation of the Kharita would be appreciated. Its reception, however, exceeded my anticipations. Shaikh Hamad was indeed most grateful for it, and I feel sure that the letter which I enclose is a sincere expression of his feelings, and ENCLOSURE IN r .

There is little doubt that the public recognition of His Excellency as Buler has consolidated his position, while he hin.seIf is personally popular with his subjects. It is to be regretted that - as I pointed out in my letter of 17th December last, N0.926-S - His Excellency lacks those qualities which would make him respected and feared as a Shaikh in addi tion to being liked as a man. 4. In the course of the speech which I made before presenting the Kharita, I took the opportunity, besides conveying to the Shaikh assurances of the friendship of the Government of India and of myself, of reviewing briefly the financial and general position of the state, ol congratulating His Excellency on certain economies which he had recently effected, and - without being unduly pessimistic - of emphasising the fact that even further economies might be necessary in the future* It is an unfortunate fact that the number of individuals outside the A1 J^haliia family who realise the seriousness of the linancial position o*^ the State is small* both Colonel Loch and I therefore considered that some remarks of this tenor would be beneficial as likely to strengthen the hand 01 the Shaikh with regard to such economies as he had already effected, or which it might be necessary for his Government to,carry out in the future, and would carry the more weight as being delivered on a public occasion.Translation of letter dated the 14th Shawal 1351 (9th February 1933) from His Excellency °haikh Hamad bin Isa al £halifa, Euler of Bahrain, addressed to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of -india.

Sir, I here the honour to state that I hare recently returned Irom a week*s tour to Bahrain. /s in the case of my tour to Kuwait, my main object was to establish friendly personal relations with the Ruler. Colonel I»och had just taken oYer from Captain Prior as Political Agent, Bahrain, and we discussed at some length the various problems with which the Bahrain State is faced. 2* The Deputy Ruler - His Excellency Shaikh Hamad (now the Ruler owing to the recent death of his father Shaikh Isa) is a kindly, simple soul, but unfortunately with no strength of character - unlike his fellow Rulers of Muscat and Kuwait. He is also la*y and unbusinesslike. Mr. Belgrave, his Financial Adviser, informed me that when unpleasant subjects, such as State finances, have to be brought to his - the Shaikh’s - notice, the latter has a trick of picking up binoculars and inspecting the shipping in- 2 - in the harbour, through the Palace windows, with other little side-tracking” diversons of a similar nature. He is extravagant, with little or no idea of the value of money, and heavily in debt, though this does not prevent him from indulging in the expensive hobby of building new residencies for himself, or his sons. His extravagances for the time being are some what curtailed by the fact that - as Mr.Belgrave informed me - the credit balance of his private account now stands at the sum of Rs.37-8-0. His passion is hawking, whic i is the only activity that really interests him. At the conclusion of the Dvrbar for instance, with which it is customary to welcome a new Polltia&amp;l Resident, and at which 1 hfd made an oration of the usual official complexion, on ray leaving the Palace, Shaikh .lama'4 who presumably had been thoroughly bored with the whole proceeding, instead of reflecting on the wise words I had Just uttered, insisted on displaying to me his favourite hawk, who - he was delighted to point out - actually answered to its name. 3. His iJccellency in short has my liking, but not my respect. A much worse man, endowed with some of the qualities of a ruler, would make a much better Shaikh. It may be that now he is de Jure Ruler, instead of Deputy Ruler, he may rise to his responsibilities! I have, however, little hope of this* It is of course possible that he may not live long to carry these responsibilities. He is nearer to 60 than to 55 and suffers from diabetes. Nor is he as careful of hie diet as he should be* At an official dinner which he was kind enough to give me, and which we ate Arab fashion withjour fibers, and seated on the ground, he disposed of large quantities of food* I do not blame him for this; the cooking was excellent, and I daresay I ate almost as much as he did, but such indulgence for a man in his condition of health cannot be continued indefinitely •••••-3- gq 1 indefinitely with impunity* 3haikh Haioad* a health raises the question of his possible successor, on which X will address Government separately, as also on the other Bahrain questions, as they come up, which 1 discussed with Colonel Loch* I have confined this despatch to an appreciation of Shaikh iamad’s character, as this ; of course, now more than ever since he is actual \uler, is an all-important factor in Bahrain affairs# I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India# I have the honour to be.

Bray has suggested that it might he desirable to consider tne advisability ^ f7^ ? of sending a message of condolence from H*w Majesty on the deatn of Sheikh Isa of Bahrein. The Viceroy, on the recommendation of the Political Hesident, has, of course, already sent a message of condolence which has been communicated to the new Sheikh. I do not think there is any precedent in the Persian Gulf for a message of this character to an Arab ruler and, while times are changing and it may be desirable to take special notice of Bahrein,*^ instinct is rather in favour of leaving things alone. On the other hand, Sir D. Bray speaks with great authority, and Sir Lionel Haworth, who called this afternoon and to vhom I mentioned the point, was inclined to think that there was much to be said for a King's message. - i 1 ,'\ j-i SJ i i i i *_} i— v r*; ; T ot* onr»tn v. ^ ~ a i . x ■&gt; i ^ . i imtm ii&gt;» tfcij) 'bnn nnw c v niiili~ni ¥4»i«ii^iitt +r'n ??™trr in lill 0 rr ^ 1? ^^n i&gt;^j oi&amp;pr But the precedents are difficult. I understand that no Indian ruler with a lower salute than 11 guns would receive a Hoyal message (unless there was some personal acquaintance with His Majesty) and Bahrein is entitled to 7 guns only (11 personal in the case of Sheikh Isa). Strictly, of course, the cases are not parallel, for Bahrein is an independent State, hut the difference in status,as measured hy guns,from the Indian standard is important. A further complication is that if a Royal message is now sent to Bahrein it would hardly he possible, without giving rise to great feeling, to avoid similar messages in future in the case of Koweit and Muscat. Muscat is in a quite special position; the Sultan receives a 21 gun salute,and is definitely Internationally independent. But Koweit is, judged hy standards of guns, etc., relatively very unimportant, although the Sheikh would feel it keenly if Bahrein were specially recognised and he were not. On/¥ On the whole 1 think there is much to he said tor doing nothing. But if anything is done perhaps the simplest course would he (subject to the concurrence of the Government of India and their thinking it desirable) a personal message from the Secretary of state. If, on the other hand, the arguments are thought to justify a special message from His kajesty, it will no doubt be necessary first to approach the Palace and drafts will be put up if required. It would be too much to send a message from the King. As regards a message from H.F.G., as suggested by Sir D. Bray, there seems to be a good deal to be said for this. There is no precedent, so far as we know, but matters are changing rapidly, and H.L'.G. have a more direct concern in the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf than was formerly the case. As. however, the sending of any message from here will be the creation of a precedent, perhaps it would go tr sufficiently0mm c, ■ ' ikm 'V ?

The Government of India recommended this step and approval was given to it by H.k.G. at the end of 1898. The announcement of the decision was postponed by the Resident, to whom discretion in the matter had been given, chiefly because of the recalcitrant disposition manifested by the Sheikh at the time in connection with customs arrangements. But the recognition was formally communicated to him on the 12th February 1901, since which date Sheikh Hamad has been the Heir Apparent.(Lorimer page 927). 3. As will be remembered, Hamad has been acting as Huler (with the style of Deputy Huler, so as to save his father's face) since the deposition of Sbeikh Isa 1 in 1923* He is the obvious and natural successor and ho objection can be raised to his formal recognition on these grounds. 4. It is conceivable that his recognition may lead to some form of protest from Persia. But that seems to be ^ risk which must be faced. We obviously cannot hold up recognition for any considerable period, ana there is little, if any, prospect ol an early settlement of the Bahrein question of a nature satisfactory to us$ nor could the Persians reasonably claim that recognition/recognition constituted a modification of the status 4U0- 5. The Colonial Office have intimated hy telephone that they do not wish to he consulted. I have sent advance copies of the telegrams to the Foreign Office who will let us know some time to-day whether they concur. It seems desirable on general grounds that recognition in a case such as this should he approved hy H.M.G. and not merely hy the Government of India.

INDIA OFFICE _ BAHREIN, 1908-1928. A.—Administration. 1. Sheikh Isa Bin Ali, K.C.LE. (1919), C.S.I. (1915), (born 1848, succeeded 1869), was relieved of control of the administration in 1923 by the Government of India with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, but remains titular Sheikh of the Islands, his eldest surviving son, Sheikh Hamad, G.S.I. (1921) (born 1874, right of succession publicly recognised by Government of India in 1901, entitled to a salute of seven guns), who has three sons, born in 1895 (Sheikh Salman), 1898 and 1902, and two brothers, Sheikh Mohammed (born 1877) and Sheikh Abdulla, C.I.E. (1915) (born 1880)! having taken over responsibility for the administration as the fully empowered agent of his father. Sheikh Isa, although no longer in fact the ruler of Bahrein, is understood to continue to carry weight locally, and his wife, a vigorous and unscrupulous lady in the sixties, who prior to his deposition was stated completely to dominate her husband, remains an important influence in the State. 2. Ihe principality is an independent Arab State, under the protection of His Majesty’s Government, but not a British Protectorate. Its ruler is precluded by his engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of treaties appended to this Memorandum, from receiving the representatives of, or entering into relations with, foreign Powers, and from ceding, selling, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, save to His Majesty’s Government, any part of his territory. He is bound to suppress the slave trade, and to prohibit traffic in arms, within his territory, and he is precluded from granting a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, save with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh (Hamad), assisted since 1926 by a European Financial Adviser* (Mr. G. Dalrymple Belgrave) and since 1924 by a European Director of Customs (Mr. de Grenier),1' who has, it is understood, been given a year’s notice, expiring in June 1929, on the initiative of the Government of India, and a European Chief of Police who is also Assistant to the Financial Adviser (Captain L. S. Parke).{ All these officers are servants of the Sheikh and are paid j Tel.from Pol.Res. tos.of from Bahrein funds. Their contracts and their conditions of service, like s. for i., t. 10 , Sept, n their original selection for employment, were, however, approved by the rK /26 and Government of India. 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are repre sented in Bahrein by the Political Agent, Bahrein (at present Lt.-Col. C. C. J. Lor. i, 931 . Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., formerly hirst Assistant Resident at Aden), an appointment created in 1904, and borne on the cadre of the Political Department of the Government of India. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty’s Commission as a Consul, and exercises no consular functions. Under the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, as amended by the Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council of 1922, he is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises jurisdiction (subject to appeal to the Court of the Political Resident) in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. His jurisdiction in the case of foreigners, exercised in the case of foreigners other than Nejdis since 1904-5, was regularised by the Order in Council of 1913 (which, owing first to the undesirability of complicating the 1913-4 negotiations with Turkey and then to the war, was not actually brought into operation until February 1919) and was extended to cover all foreigners in 1920. * Appointed for four years in the first instance, subject to three months’ notice, from June 1926, on Rs. 1,000—50—2,200, &amp;c.

The effect of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of Bahrein affairs, other than matters of policy affecting relations with Ibn Sand, which were reserved to the Colonial Office to the Government of India, subject to the general control of His Majesty’s* Government, and to the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office in matters^ “political significance.” The question of the channels through which tUf instructions of His Majesty's Government on matters affecting the Islands issue is dealt with in paras. 4 and 5 of the Note on Political Control in thp Persian Gulf, p. 6. Expenditure on Bahrein in respect of the suppression of the slave trade (Ks. 52 in 1919-20) and of sanitary arrangements (Ps. 1,200 in 1919-20) is divided equally between the Government of India and the Foreign Office. All other expenditure, on the Agency, Darbar presents, &amp;c. (amounting in 1919-20 to Rs. 79,304) is borne wholly by the Government of India.* B.—Internal History of Bahrein (including relations with His Majesty’s Government), 1908-1928. 7. The internal history of Bahrein falls into two periods : the first from 1908 to the deposition of Sheikh Isa in 1923, the second from 1923 to the present day. (1) 1908-1923 : Sheikh Isa. 8. Little of importance occurred between 1908 and 1919. In 1909 a formal request in writing that he should be relieved by His Majesty’s Government of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his country was obtained by the Political Agent from the Sheikh ( P.1314/09). His Excellency explained in 1912 that by “ foreigners ” he had not intended the dependants of petty Arab potentates in the Gulf, a contention which was accepted by His Majesty’s Government in 1919, but which, in view of the attitude of the Arab chiefs affected, it proved impossible, as explained below, to continue to entertain. The Order in Council approved by the King in 1913, the introduction of which was postponed till 1919, limited the jurisdiction of the Political Agent to “foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh has agreed with His Majesty for. or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty.” Certain minor administrative improvements were effected by the Sheikh from time to time under strong pressure from the Political Agent; in 1911 His Excellency agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Office in Bahrein and not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners!; a wi reless station was erected in 1912; with great difficulty the Sheikh was persuaded between 1912 and 1914 to remedy the grievances of traders in regard to landing arrange ments and the handling and storage of cargo at Bahrein! ; after some discussion he agreed in 1914§ not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India (subsequent developments as regards oil concessions in Bahrein are dealt with in para. 19 below); responsibility for the quarantine duties, which had caused some difficulty in the past,'; was taken over in 1916 by the Government of India; the attitude of the Sheikh and his sons during the war was correct. But the position as between the ruling family and their subjects steadily deteriorated; administration lapsed until it could be reported in 1922 as “far behind the times in comparison with other Arab States” the “ bigoted incapacity ” of the Sheikh (to quote the Political Resident in 1911), the corruption or weakness of members of his family, and the succession of tyrannical acts perpetrated by the Sheikh, his wife and his sons, not only gave rise to increasing popular discontent, but, since the Political Agent was not in a position to intervene effectively (the energies of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India being elsewhere engaged), reacted unfavourably on our position in the Islands. 9. In 1919 Sheikh Abdulla, the Sheikh’s youngest son, visited England in charge of Capt. N. N. E. Bray, to convey to His Majesty the congratulations of Sheikh Isa on the successful outcome of the war, and was received by theKing. In an interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel on 1st September 1919 he •demanded on behalf of Sheikh Isa that the latter should be— (a) put on an equality with neighbouring Arab rulers in the exercise A of authority over all persons other than subjects of Great Britain and the Great European Powers, and so over Arabs other than subjects of Bahrein ; (b) empowered to select the bench of magistrates [under the Bahrein Order in Council the Majlis-el-Urf, or Civil Court, is composed of not less than four members selected by the Political Agent in concert with the Sheikh]; (c) permitted and assisted to develop the port of Zubarah in El Katr, which he claimed had once belonged to Bahrein (Cp. Lorimer : Persian Gulf Gazetteer I. i. 814); (d) given permission to correspond direct with London, should necessity arise. 10. After consideration of the views of Capt. Bray, Major Dickson, then Political Agent, the Political Pesident and the Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia, the Government of India on 5th May 1920* informed Sheikh Abdulla that the procedure for the selection of the members of the Majlis was laid down in the Bahrein Order in Council and that it was not within their competence to alter it, but that in practice the Arab representatives were understood to be appointed by Sheikh Isa, and that although this appointment was subject to the approval of the Political Agent as representing the Protecting Power, the Political Agent would never interfere or refuse his approval without just cause ; that as regards his third point, the request was an old one which had received much consideration, and that the Government of India remained unable to accede to it in view of the difficulties involved ; while as regards direct correspondence, the political relations of Bahrein were conducted with the Government of India and that it was proper therefore that His Excellency should address them and not His Majesty’s Government. They would if necessary forward his correspondence to His Majesty’s Government. As regards the first and most important request, the Government of India agreed that he should exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab rulers, subject to the formal concurrence of those rulers. I bn Saudi, however, and the Sheikh of Katr, the one previously, the other subsequently, took exception to the exercise of control over their subjects by the Sheikh of Bahrein, and requested the Political Agent to •exercise the jurisdiction in question. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920,J a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The transfer to the Political Agent of jurisdiction over all foreigners did not improve relations between the Political Agent and Sheikh Isa, already none too good as a result of the interference by Government in a dispute between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand as to the duty to be levied on goods proceeding to Hasa, consequent on which Sheikh Isa had been compelled to accept 2 per cent, duty instead of the 5 per cent, which he desired, and in which he regarded Government as having favoured Ibn Sand at his expense.§ 11. This condition of affairs coincided with an internal crisis of a different character, which was destined to lead up to drastic intervention by His Majesty’s Government and the deposition of Sheikh Isa. The difficult situation produced by the Sheikh’s misgovernment, and its reactions on the position of Great Britain in the Islands, have already been mentioned. Captain Bray, in May 1919, expressed the opinion that there was in Bahrein a considerable feeling of hostility to His Majesty’s Government “due to religious, economical, personal and war reasons,” and no British party, and that the activities of the American missionaries were anti-British. Major H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., a highly qualified officer with a distinguished record of service in Mesopotamia, who succeeded him as Political Agent, reported in January 1920] that the political situation in Bahrein, while in no way dangerous, was wholly unsatisfactory ; that there was a strong and deep-seated anti-British sentiment of long standing, and that British prestige rested on fear and not on respect.

Daly, C.LE.) in 1 ( .)21, and led by the end of that year to a deputation to ask for intervention to the 1 olitical Resident in the leisi^^L Gulf. 12 The Resident accepted the position, and suggested to the Government of India that a possible solution might be that the Political Agent should be empowered to intervene in cases of gross oppression and give individual protection where necessary* Earlier in 1921 Sheikh Abdulla had taken alarm at the rising discontent, and Sheikh Isa had appointed his heir, Sheikh Hamad, to take over control under his orders, but the masterful wife of Sheikh'isa had prevented any advance. The attitude of the people became, however, sulhcientlv alarming to lead Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Abdulla early in 1922 to take certain minor steps in the direction of reform, and the Government of India, who m January 1922 had stated that they weie not prepared to consider drastic intervention until all local resources had been exhausted and intervention was imperative to secure the protection of foreigners and the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Islands, and who remained anxious to avoid interference if it could be avoided, informed tbe Resident in the light of this that while it was most undesirable that they should be drawn into interference between the Sheikh and his subjects, they were prepared to lend their moral support to an honest attempt by the Sheikh to put his scheme into force. They emphasised that nothing should be done to encourage the idea that reforms were being introduced by the Sheikh at the dictation of Government. 1J The reforms, however, proved illusory ; the internal situation continued threatening ; the Foreign Office, who in March 1922 had urged the taking of immediate^steps of reform, in view of the prejudicial effect on the position of His Majesty’s Government in Persia of “ the present highly unsatisfactory state of affairs in Bahrein,”! again represented the necessity for action, in the interests of the Shiah subjects of the Sheikhs, on 29th May 1922.! The Secretary of State for India referred the matter to the Government of India, and they to the Resident in the Gulf. The Political Agent thereupon recommended a postponement of action, partly to enable developments to be watched, partly to appraise tbe importance of the interest in Bahrein affairs of Ibn Sand, and this recommendation was accepted; but by the end of 1922 the Political Resident was obliged to repoit that the state of «iffans m Bahrein called for reform more urgently than ever, and that Government must be prepared to back up moral pressure by material force if the required reforms were to be carried through. 14. Finally, in April 1923,§ the Government of India, who recognised that if the status of Bahrein and our position in the Islands was brought before the League by Persia, “ misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case,” recommended that if Sheikh Isa could not be persuaded to take the necessary steps himself, he should be deposed, his son Abdulla deported, and the required reforms carried out by the Government of India. His Majesty’s Government approved action on these lines, and Sheikh Isa proving obdurate, he was deprived of his control on 2Gth May 1923, and granted an allowance,|| and his son. Sheikh Hamad, appointed to act for him “as his father’s fully empowered Agent.” It was found unnecessary to deport Sheikh Abdulla. Appeals by Sheikh Isa to the High Commissioner for Iraq and the Viceroy, culminating in an appeal in 1925 to the Secretary of State for India, were rejected. (2) 1923—1928: Sheikh Hamad. 15 After a disturbed beginning, the result of the activities of the partisans of the old regime, in the course of which a firm line had to be taken with the (Sunni) Dowasir tribe resident in the north-east of the ii R s 4 000 per mensem from customs, which for some years he refused to draw (1 .107 2o, P 1193725 • P 2221/27), and Rs. 2,000 per annum, in addition to his private income ot Ets 2 500 per mensem (letter from Political Resident to Government of India, 283 S, dated L5th June 1923, P. 2729 A/23).Island of Bahrein, as a result ol which they migrated to Ibn Baud’s territory in llasa, from which they now (1928) show signs of returning, conditions in Bahrein have stabilised themselves under the rule of Sheikh Hamad. But that rule has been substantially rule by the Political Agent. On the ^commendation of the Political Resident in the Gulf, the Government of India, with much reluctance, agreed in 1923 to the permanent appointment of a British Director of Customs (this on the request of the Sheikhs—post filled January 1921), and the raising of a small force to maintain order (raised 1924, changed to an armed police force, in 1926, under a British officer); while in 1926 a Ji-uropean Adviser was appointed to deal with judicial, financial and general administration. All these officials were, in fact, appointed on the recommendation and with the approval of Government, though they are the servants of the Sheikhs and formally appointed by them. 16. The correspondence which has passed since 1923 between the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Gulf shows increasing reluctance on the part of the former to assume full responsibility for the control of Bahrein, or to do more than carry the Sheikh wholeheartedly with them in the path of reform while avoiding the “ Westernisation ” of his State. It is understood that in pursuance of this policy they have had under consideration the diminution of the overt signs of British influence in Bahrein ; that the European Director of Customs has now been given a year’s notice and will not be replaced ; that the European police officer may also be dispensed with, and that an ultimate concentration under a single competent European, such as the present Financial Adviser, of direct responsibility for their Departments is in contemplation. 17. In the discussions between the Sheikhs and the Political Agent which took place consequent on the reassertion in December 1927 of the Persian claim to Bahrein, it is satisfactory to be able to record that while Sheikh Isa remained sensitive regarding the maintenance of his internal inde pendence, Sheikh Hamad, the de facto ruler. Sheikh Abdulla, and also Sheikh Salman, the eldest son of Sheikh Hamad, are stated by the Political Resident to have displayed anxiety, in their own interests, to admit to the full the protection of Great Britain. 18. The policy of His Majesty’s Government in Bahrein is one of the points for consideration by the present Sub-Committee, and on the decision on it must turn the decision on the degree of interference and control to be exercised over the internal administration of the Islands. But it is pertinent to quote the remarks of the Political Resident in the Gulf, made though they were before the situation was modified b}' the reassertion of the Persian claim to suzerainty, in his Despatch* of 1st September 1927 : — “ \\ e cannot lose Bahrein. But, notwithstanding our outwardly strong position in the Islands, a single serious quarrel with Sheikhs Isa and Hamad, a quarrel engineered by Ibn Sand on religious grounds, or through Persia on political grounds, and we should have to vacate our privileged position or force ourselves on the principality in the face of the world against the wishes of its rulers.” C.— Oil in Bahrein. 19. The Sheikh agreed in 1914 not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. The question of obtaining a concession was revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who appear originally to have raised it in 1918, in 1921. Negotiations on their behalf were undertaken with the Sheikh of Bahrein through the Political Resident, but agreement proved impracticable, and in the event a concession, granting an exclusive exploration licence for a period not exceeding two years, subject to renewal by the Sheikh, acting on the advice of the PoliticarResident, for certain further periods, was signed by the Sheikh of Bahrein (also with the approval of His Majesty’s Government) in favour of the Eastern and General Syndicate on 2nd December 1925. It was decided in 1928 to advise the Sheikh that all future agreements with oil companies should contain a clause to the effect that no alienation of rights whatever could be made, except with the sanction of the Sheikh and the approval of His Majesty’s Government.

During this period the dominating and almost the only question affecting the external relations of Bahrein remains that of its status Turkey and Persia. I.—Turkey and Bahrein. 21. An agreement between Great Britain and Turkey, signed on 29th July 1913, as part of the general negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government, but, like the other agreements concluded in the course of these negotiations, awaiting ratification on the outbreak of war, finally disposed of the Turkish claim to suzerainty, which must in any event have been practically effected by Ibn Sand’s capture of Hasa in 1913. By Article 13 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention the Ottoman Government renounced all their claims to the Islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised ; His Majesty’s Government declaring on their part that they had no intention of annexing the island. His Majesty’s Government undertook in Article 11 of the same Convention not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr, or to annex it, and in Article 14 that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries, while the Turkish Government accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyeh Island for fishing, and recognised the right of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. Owing to the outbreak of war, the agreement in question was never ratified ; but the Turkish claim to Bahrein would seem to have disappeared with the disappearance of the Turkish Empire and the elimination of Turkey from the Persian Gulf, and no endeavour has been made to revive it since the end of the war. II.—Persia and Bahrein. (a) 1908-1922. 22. Despite the nine repudiations enumerated in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, the Persian claim was kept alive in the years 1908-14. Representations made by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to the Persian Government in 1908 in regard to the punishment of a Bahrein subject at LingahJ* produced the reply that instructions had been sent to Lingah “ to make reparation and do the man justice,” but that, as to the question of Bahrein, the Minister “ will admit that the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the Island is not a matter to be disputed.” Considerable subsequent discussion took place with the Persian Government, with a view to the withdrawal of this Note or the modification of its terms. In view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government considered it inopportune to raise the question of Bahrein in its general aspect, a somewhat gentler line was taken with the Persian Government than was perhaps altogether consistent with the attitude adopted before and since by His Majesty’s Government; and it was only after unsuccessful efforts to secure the substitution of a modified version that the Persian Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.t The Persian Foreign Office thereupon declared that, if the Note returning the objectionable communication could be withdrawn, the Persian Government would send in substitution for the latter an amended Note in the sense desired, adding that, if this arrangement was not accepted, they would be obliged to send a strong reply to the British Note. The Minister remarked that this would have raised the general question of Bahrein, for which the moment was clearly inopportune, and that he had therefore accepted the proposed arrangement. The amended Note was accepted, and the matter closed with a Note from His Majesty’s Minister dated the 13th May 1909, acknowledging receipt and reaffirming that His Majesty’s Government maintained, as regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia, the position that the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants were under British protection, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian Government make representations necessary.23. Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of travellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to assert Persian ^vereignty over the Island4 It was agreed that, in view of the desirability oi avoiding raising of the general question, no protest should be made. 24. In July 1910 the Political Resident reported|t that internal Persian coastal passes issued to Persians proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were visaed by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein, who was also in the habit of issuing similar passes (“ llin-o-khabar ”) to Persians proceeding from Bahrein to Persian ports, and His Majesty’s Government approved a proposal that the merchant in question, Abdul Nabi, should be expelled from the Island.§ For various reasons it proved necessary to suspend action on this authority, but in 1912 Abdul Nabi was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by Persian subjects for travel in Bahrein. The endorsements in question were, however, thenceforth granted by the Political Agent, a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years later,[| “of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian port to persons going to Bahrein.” 2.'3. Efforts made by His Majesty’s Government in 1913 to secure Persian recognition of our right to protect Bahreinis and subjects of the Trucial Chiefs as a condition precedent to the granting to Persia of the loan then under negotiation proved unavailing. 00 (b) 1922-1927. 20. There were no fresh developments of importance until after the war. In the year .1922 His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah,* at which port British India Steam Navigation Company’s vessels put in from Bahrein, had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representations being made by the Minister at Tehran, instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In the same year, His Majesty’s Minister suggested that Persians going to Bahrein should be required to obtain British visas or passes, and should be turned back if they had not got them, a procedure the adoption of which was recommended by the Political Agent, who regarded it as feasible. It was subjected accordingly to examination by the Government of India and the Foreign Office, with the results shown below. In 1922 also the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire, while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, stated that his action was without prejudice to Persian claims to Bahrein.! 27. At about the same time a Press campaign for the return of Bahrein to Persia and for its direct representation in the Majlis was started in the Persian papers. This discussion culminated in a motion in the Majlis to give Bahrein the right to return a Member, a demand for the immediate discussion of which was rejected, but which was referred to a Commission for report.f His Majesty’s Government, in the light of this development, decided that it was desirable to instruct the Minister at Tehran to address a formal Note to the Persian Government, in terms similar to those employed in 1906, and considered the question of asking the Admiralty to despatch a vessel to show the Flag in the neighbourhood of Bahrein. The Government of India concurred in the action proposed, and expressed the view that, i£ a Note was presented, the withdrawal of passport measures should be included, remarking (doubtless with the proposals on the subject of the Minister at Tehran in mind) that, whether a Note was presented or not, they saw no objection to retaliatory measures requiring visitors to Bahrein to take out a British visa.§ They added, however, that the critical internal situation in Persia made it doubtful whether the present moment was opportune for action. At about the same time the Persian Government instructed its + Teh. Desp. 65, April 26 1910, P. 35S9/10. ft P 3655/10. § F.O. tel. to Tehran, 219, July 16 1910. Letter from Pol.

The serious internal situation in Persia made it necessary to postpoi^ action on the lines approved by His Majesty’s Government, and temporarily p 24^3 ° July 111923, to ^ ro P t ^ ie P/oposal, in which the India Office had concurred,5] to take retaliatory action in the matter of passports should the Persian Government not withdraw the instructions they had issued on that question to their officials in the Gulf. 29. No further steps were taken until September 1923, when the Persian Government were informed that the Island was now a British Protectorate and that Bis Majesty’s Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status—a declaration met by a statement by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. This did not prevent the Minister for Foreign Affairs from again raising the question in the following month in a conversation in the course of which Sir Percy Loraine tentatively suggested, in his personal capacity, the possibilitv of putting the matter to arbitration, a suggestion for making which he was sharply rebuked by the Foreign Office, and from which nothing resulted. 30. Between 1923 and 1927 there was a lull, and no point of real' importance arose. His Majesty’s Government were reluctant to face the question of the status of Bahrein, and in consequence adopted in general an accommodating attitude so far as possible on minor questions. Thus, on the vexed question of the use by Bahreinis of Persian passports and Oct T 3 i'i 925 P i ,t0 73 / 26 574 ’ trave ^ n1 ^' passes (1 lui-o-Khabar), agreement was reached in 192o' :i: ' ;:: that Bahrein subjects should not be subjected to the new Persian passport regulations, the production of an Ihn-o-Khabar sufficing, and His Majesty’s Government, despite the apparent concession of principle involved in the recognition of the Ilm-o-Khabar, decided in 1927 tacitly to acquiesce in this — partly on the ground that the recognition of these documents could be * G. of i. to i.o Sept. 5 ignored, since they were also being issued by Persia in the case of Koweit, 1927, r. 4573 / 27 ’ the status of which was not in dispute; 0 to let the question of independent \ F -° t ;y L() -’ Nov - 2 1927, Bahreini passports lie; and to allow the matter generally to rest unless ti co^to Jo j u iy 24 ^ was revived by Persian action.! There were no developments until June i 92 s. i.o. to f.o., Aug. 17 1928, when the refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to visa the pass of a 1928, p. 3913-. 4055/28. Bahreini—an incident now under examination—again raised the question.H 31. In September 1928, the Political Resident, on learning that a Persian residing at Bahrein was endorsing Persian Ilm-o-Khabar for Persians for the return journey to Persia, instructed the Political Agent to tell the Sheikh to issue orders that no one bearing such documents would be allowed to land, and to inform the offender who was issuing endorsements that he was usurping the powers of a Government official, which could be performed only with the consent of the Sheikh, and that he would be requested to leave the island unless he desisted. The vigorous reassertion of the Persian claim to Bahrein dealt with below renders it desirable to keep a vigilant watch lor any action which might be construed or represented by Persia as an admission of their claim to suzerainty over Bahrein, and while it is not clear how persons carrying Ilm-o-Khabar are to be identified on Tel. from Pol.

It may be mentioned at this point that the Belgian Administrator- General of the Persian Customs stated early in 1928 that “about four years ago ” he had been taken to task by the Government of the day for imposing customs duties on goods imported from Bahrein to Persia ; and that he had replied that “customs dues had always been so levied . . . and that before- they could be abandoned . . . the Persian Government would have to- institute a customs control at Bahrein itself.”!9 Reassertion of Persian Claim and Appeal to League, 1927. 33. The deposition of Sheikh Isa by His Majesty’s Government in 1923, and the subsequent increase in the degree of active British influence, yUpiphasised the position publicly taken in Bahrein by His Majesty’s government, but the Persian claim was not again actively reasserted until the text of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded with Ibn Saud on 20th May 1927, in which Bahrein was referred to as having “ special Treaty relations ” with His Majesty’s Government, provoked a strong protest by Persia, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations with a request for circulation.|t The Persian protest was based largely on an alleged recognition of Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in a Note dated 29th April 1869, from the Earl of Clarendon, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A reasoned reply to the Persian Note, which (after a brief delay in the hope that an arrangement might be reached with Persia) was equally communicated to, and circulated by, the League, was despatched by His Majesty’s Government on 18th January 1928. Suflice it to say that His Majesty’s Government, while avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis, again repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms. 34. The Government of India, who but for the Persian protest would have inclined to favour a proposal of the Political Resident, under consideration at the time of its receipt, that His Majesty’s Government should set the seal on their position in Bahrein by a formal treaty of protection, provided that this was not precluded by wider considerations of foreign policy, recognised the tactical objections to such action in face of Persia’s appeal to the League.§ They commended, in the circumstances, a proposal by Sir L. Haworth that the Sheikhs should be apprised of Persia’s claim and encouraged to give a power of attorney to His Majesty’s Government to defend their independence at Geneva, and if possible state their dependence on our protection. This latter proposal was approved by His Majesty’s Government!! on the understanding that no pressure of any kind should be brodght to bear on the Sheikh to secure the documents. His Majesty’s Government added that, in their view, the desirability of stressing the “ dependence on our protection ” of the Sheikhs was doubtful, and suggested that the point could better be disposed of by reference to the special treaty relations of the Sheikhs with His Majesty’s Government. 35. The Political Resident reported on 19th March 192St[ that he had obtained a letter from Sheikhs Isa and Hamad appointing Ilis Majesty’s Government, in accordance with their treaties, “to defend Bahrein from outside interference,” and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohammed, brother of Sheikh Hamad and son of Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. ’The Resident added that no pressure had been brought to bear to obtain this document, but that now that matters had gone so far with the Sheikhs any compromise with Persia on the basis of the status quo would have a very undesirable and unsettling effect on them, and that a definite disposal of the matter, by Persian withdrawal of the case or its reference to the League, was necessary. 36. There seemed at an earlier stage some reason to believe that the Persian Note to His Majesty’s Government was designed rather to prevent their claim from lapsing sub silentio than in the hope of any positive result, and that the Persian Government regretted the reference to the League.** The question has come up several times in the course of the recent negotiations with Persia, when Sir R. Clive has uniformly made it clear that there is no prospect of His Majesty’s Government resiling from the position taken in the Note of reply. A formal answer to that Note has, however, now been made by Persia,tt and communicated to the League of Nations, and it seems clear that the claim is to be pressed. The Persian answer is, broadly speaking, based on the claims that Persian suzerainty over Bahrein was recognised by His Majesty’s Government in 1869—a contention disposed of in the Note sent to Persia in January 1928—and that a sine qua non of 2979d B tt Teh.

Till this latest development, despite much activity in the Persian Press.' ::: ‘ and the encouragements of the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran,f thei4^ seemed little real probability that the matter would be pursued at Geneva. If however, the latest communication should make this inevitable, not only can the paper arguments be strengthened by the addition of miscellaneous evidence which has come to light since the British Note of January 1928 was drafted but the presence of a representative of the Sheikhs will carry some weight. The difficulty in present circumstances of the establishment by Persia of effective control in Bahrein, even should her suzerainty per improbabile be admitted in the island, makes it perhaps more probable that she will endeavour merely to use the cpaestion as a pawn in the forthcoming negotiations. In that event consideration will have to be given to the remarks of the Political Resident quoted above as to the necessity for a definite decision aud the undesirability of a compromise on the basis of the status quo, remarks recently reinforced by unofficial statements by the Financial Adviser in Bahrein (Mr. Belgravc) as to the apprehensions of the Sheikhs lest llis Majesty’s Government should sacrifice their interests to Persia as the price of an accommodation on matters of purely British concern. From the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, a settlement which would enable us to avoid public examination and discussion of our position in the Islands is to be desired. III.---Ibn Saud and Bahrein. (a) 1913-1923. 38. Ibn Sand’s contact with Bahrein commenced with his capture of Hasa from the Turks in 1913. Under the Treaty concluded with His Majesty’s Government on 26th December 1915, Ibn Saud undertook, “as his Fathers did before him, to refrain from ail aggression on or interference with the territories of . . . Bahrein . . .” During the war he established a commercial forwarding agency in Bahrein (the Qusaibi) and began to take some interest at Bahrein ; in 1919 the Political Agent found it necessary to bring pressure to bear on Sheikh Isa to secure an equitable settlement of a dispute which had arisen owing to the imposition by the Sheikh of customs duties on goods passing through Bahrein in transit to Hasa and Nejd ; at the end of July 1920 the Political Adviser, Bahrein, reported that Sheikh Salim of Koweit had recently been in touch with Sheikh Isa, it was suggested with a view to securing his adherence to the movement against Ibn Saud which he was then fomenting—though nothing appears to have come of this ; while in 1922 Ibn Saud encouraged the recalcitrant Dowasir Bahrein tribe by offering them sanctuary in Hasa, an offer accepted on the abandonment of Bahrein by the tribe after the deposition of Sheikh Isa in 1923.;jl At the moment of the deposition of the Sheikh (April .1923) Ibn Sand’s agent had achieved an objectionable prominence in the Nejdi-Persian rioting which took place at Bahrein ; and His Majesty’s Government finally approved a pi*oposal by the Political Resident that he should be removed from Bahrein by being sent to Ibn Saud with a letter complaining of his conduct, requesting the Sultan to deal with the case, and asking that His Highness, before sending another Agent to Bahrein, should arrange to secure the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government in his choice. A formal protest by Ibn Saud against this action was disposed of by the Political Resident, who refused to compromise, and the Qusaibi was finally allowed to return to Bahrein on a clearer understanding as to his position and functions. (b) 1923-1928. 39. There were no developments of importance between 1923 and 1927. W hen the Treaty of Jeddah was in negotiation with Ibn Saud in 1927, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were anxious to secure from the King of the Hejaz and Nejd an undertaking similar to that embodied in the Treaty of 1915 and quoted in para. 38 above. His Majesty would not, however, go beyond an undertaking “ to maintain friendly and peaceful'relations with the territories of . . . Bahrein . . There is no evidence at the moment of a more positive interest in Bahrein on the part of Ibn Sand ; but there is little question that he and the Wahabi movement, and not Persia, is the real danger; that as matters stand he is our natural successor if we Aband on our present position in Bahrein, that his power is appreciated and reared by the Sheikhs, and that an active development of Wahabism on the North Arabian coast, coupled with bad relations with the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, might react embarrassingly on our position in Bahrein. The remarks of Sheikh Hamad in April 1927, that “Ibn Saud was the one big Arab Ruler, and it was natural for all the smaller Sheikhs such as himself to look up to him and try to please him,’’* are symptomatic. E.—Summary. 40. Internally, the last 20 years have seen the consolidation of British influence in Bahrein. The Sheikh has agreed to grant neither oil nor pearling concessions without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government; jurisdiction over foreigners in the islands has passed from the Ruler to the Political Agent; internal misrule has been checked by the deposition of Sheikh Isa, the substitution of Sheikh Hamad, and the provision for the new Sheikh of competent and disinterested European advisers under his orders. 41. Externally, the claim to suzerainty of Turkey has lapsed. The claims of Persia have constantly been reasserted, and as constantly repudiated by His Majesty’s Government, over the period now in question. They are at the moment under argument, and have acquired a new importance by their reference to the League of Nations. Present indications are that Persia is likely to press them, and the desirability, in the interests of the Sheikhs, who have appointed His Majesty’s Government their agents in the matter, and on whom a compromise with Persia on the basis of the status quo would, according to the Political Resident, have a very unsettling effect of securing a decision which will finally dispose of them inter nationally, is for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. The rise of Ibn Saud is, however, the development most pregnant with possibility in the external relations of Bahrein. The King of the Hejaz and Nejd has not so far actively interested himself in the islands ; and the fact that the power which he has built up may not survive his death cannot be ignored. But, on the assumption of the survival of the existing state of things in Nejd, the present Memorandum (para. 39) makes the suggestion that it is Ibn Saud and the Wahabi movement, rather than Persia, that represent the real danger from a practical standpoint, and that were His Majesty’s Government for any reason to abandon their present position in Bahrein, Ibn Saud would, as matters stand, be their natural successor. Position in Bahrein of His Majesty’s Government. 42. While, however, His Majesty’s Government, as stated above, have over the past 20 years established ade facto control of the Islands of Bahrein, de jure their position is no stronger than before. At the same time, the importance of establishing that position on a stable basis has very greatly increased since 1908. Prom the naval standpoint, Bahrein, although it has been suggested, as a pis oiler, as a naval base or a coaling depot, has the disadvantage of unhealthy climate and relative remoteness from the exit of the Gulf and so from the probable scene of naval operations in the event of war.‘ :;: ' The Air Ministry| regard it, however, as of great potential importance from the standpoint of British air interests—not only because of its geographical position on the route to India, but because the isolation of the islands from the mainland, and the long-established influence in them of His Majesty’s Government render them less likely to be disturbed by anti-British rumours than other places on the Arabian coast. The Government of India (substantial Indian commercial interests in Bahrein apart) take the view that Bahrein as a central air base and political centre for the control of the increasingly important Arab littoral may be regarded as a key position inside the Gulf of an importance at least equal to that of Muscat at its mouth. The probability that Persia will press her efforts to terminate British influence on the south Persian coast, the necessity, should * Letter from P. A., Bahrein, to Pol. Res., C/53 April 14 11127, P. 3334/27. * Admiralty to C.O., Jan. 19 1928, P. 345. + A,M. to C.O., Pec. 28 1927, P. 5/28.12 those efforts succeed, of consolidating that influence on the Arab littoral, and' the possibility that the removal of the headquarters of the Political Resident from Pushire may have to be considered, all combine to invest Bahrein with an importance very substantially greater than in 1908 from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government. 43. On the assumption, then, that Imperial considerations, our obligations- to the Sheikh apart, make it desirable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain and consolidate their position in Bahrein, the question arises of how this is to be achieved. The matter is one which calls for careful handling. On the one hand, Persia has appealed to the League, on the Council of which she is now' represented, and there is a possibility that she may endeavour to make a compromise on Bahrein a condition precedent to agreement with His Majesty’s Government on other Gulf questions. On the other hand, it appears that a compromise, even on the basis of the maintenance of the status quo, w T ould have a definitely unsettling effect on the- Sheikhs, who are suspicions that His Majesty’s Government may use them as pawns to secure concessions from Persia of value to Great Britain only ; that a decision which will definitely dispose internationally of the Persian claim is therefore desirable: and that, while the deposed Sheikh Jsa remains- sensitive regarding the maintenance of internal independence, the cle facto ruler, his heir, and his brother, are anxious, in the face of Persian claims, to admit to the full the protection of Great Britain. It may perhaps be assumed that if the Persian claim could be disposed of before His Majesty’s Government had finally consolidated their position, much stronger opposition to such consolidation might be expected from the ruling family, and this appears to make it desirable to seize the present opportunity to- establish the British position once for all. 44. 1 he simplest method of at once asserting internationally the British view of the status of Bahrein and establishing the position in the islands of His Majesty’s Government the Sheikh, would probably on the whole be the conclusion of a formal treaty of protection, a course under consideration in India (see para. 34 above) at the time of the reassertion of the Persian claim last year. Had Persia been prepared to abandon her claim in deference to His Majesty’s Government, the Treaty with Bahrein could have been concluded simultaneously with its abandonment. But as she is undoubtedly not prepared to compromise, such a treaty could only be concluded in the face of Persian protests to the League and elsewhere,, and the wider considerations of international policy involved in its conclusion would call for close examination before a decision is taken regarding it. An alternative method of solution might be arbitration, to wdiich various objections are obvious.
