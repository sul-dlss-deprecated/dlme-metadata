THE Shah still lives, and yesterday was better. Last night the Valiahd arrived in Tehran. No. 2. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received December 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 29, 1906. THE Shah’s health has again improved, but the Valiahd now holds the Regency. No. 3. Memorandum furnished by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, January 1907, Summary of Events in Persia for the year 1906. THE year 1906 has been a very important epoch in Persian history, for it has brought with it the introduction of Parliamentary institutions. The condition of Persia had been for some time growing more and more intolerable. The Shah was entirely in the hands of a corrupt ring of courtiers who were living on the spoils of the Government and country. He had parted with the treasures inherited from his father, and with most of the Imperial and national domain. He had thus been obliged to have recourse to foreign loans, the proceeds of which he Jiad spent in foreign travel or had lavished on his courtiers. 1 here was a yearly deficit, and the debt of the country was growing daily. There appeared to be no resource but another foreign loan, which, as was known, would be expended in the same way as preceding loans, and it was generally believed that the loan would only be granted under conditions which would practically extinguish the independence of the country. A certain number of young and independent men were aware of the facts, and were themselves engaged by the Government in the negotiations which were being carried on with a view to the loan. These facts, known in their entirety to a few who could not divulge the details, were vaguely known to a large number of Persians, and especially to the priests. Already in the time of the late Atabeg a formidable movement had been started at Kerbela against the policy under which the country was being gradually sold to foreigners by the Shah and his Court. A new Grand Vizier had been appointed, whose moving principle was believed to be independence of foreign control. His first act was to attempt some sort of financial reform, the object of which was to render the country independent of foreign financial assistance. But as soon as^ lie had obtained control of the Government, it was apparent that his main and principal object was to make money. He made an alliance with the Shah’s chief adviser for a division of the spoil. Governments were put up for sale, grain was hoarded and sold at extortionate prices, the Government domains were stolen or sold for the benefit of [1072] Bthe two conspirators, rich men were summoned to Tehran and forced to disgorge large sums of money, oppression of every sort was countenanced foi aconsi eiai ’ _ property, and even the lives, of all Persian subjects were at their mercy, i ^ was every reason to believe that a conspiracy was on foot to dethrone the foo s and impotent Shah and to oust the Valiahd. In their place was to be put the Shooa-es- Sultaneh, the Shah’s younger son, who was a by-word even in Persia for extortion and victims of the tyranny of their The Governor of Tehran, without any just cause, cruelly beaten. A. large number of the prominent The policy of the Atabeg and his friends had thus aroused the opposition of all classes in Persia : of the few more or less patriotic statesmen, who knew to what a goal the country was being led ; of the priests, who felt that their old power and independence would perish with that of their country ; and of the great mass oi the population and the mercantile classes, who were the daily oppressors. In December the storm broke. ordered an aged Seyed to be ^ ... Mujteheds toak “bast” in the shrine of Shah Abdul Azim, near the capital. Ine Government did all it could, by bribes and intimidation, to break up their resistance ; the only result was that any priest who yielded to the Government was promptly branded as a traitor. The Shah gave way, and made some vague promises as io the grant of popular representation and the reform of justice and administration. But the refugees had published their statement of grievances in a clear and striking form. They appealed to the patriotism of the Persian people and to the beliefs and traditions of true Mussulmans, and they publicly accused the Government of the Shah and his courtiers as responsible for the sufferings of the people and the disgrace of the country. By the end of January the first act was over, and the refugees were brought back to Tehran in the Shah’s own carriages, escorted by an enthusiastic crowd. The Government seemed to think that the danger was over. There were dissensions between the popular leaders and the priests, who began to feel that a new element, dangerous to their authority, was coming to the fore. The Government had collected a certain number of devoted men, on whom it was thought they could count in the event of disorders. Iso definite step was taken to give ehect to the Shah’s promises, except a vague letter promising Courts of Justice and a new Code, and the appointment of a Council to consider the whole question of reforms. In this Council it soon became evident that the Government could control the leaders of the reform move ment, and that the sympathies of the great Mujteheds were not heartily with the popular movement. All was outwardly quiet in Tehran, but in the provinces the people of Shiraz and Resht had taken violent measures to prevent the reappointment of the Shah’s sons as their Governors, and the movement in both cases was successful. In the capital itself the streets and the bazaars were quiet, but every day sermons were preached in the mosques, in which, as one of the popular party said, “ What we hardly dared to think a year ago was openly spoken.” The best-known preacher of Tehran, a Prince of the Imperial house, preached every Friday against the tyrannies and corruption of the* Government. An order for his expulsion was issued. The chief Mujteheds, incited by the people, pressed the Government to withdraw the measure, and the Government had to yield. And in this incident a new element made itself manifest, for the preacher in question was the advocate of a union of all Mussulmans, and he enjoyed the special protection and friendship of the Turkish Ambassador. The movement was not only popular, but religious, and it threatened the very existence of the Kajar dynasty. The Government had now recourse to the old measure of a “ Council,” in which it counted on its former success. It was not disappointed. Hardly any one dared to speak plainly and frankly. There was, however, one exception. The Ehtesham-es- Sultaneh, in a vigorous and eloquent speech, the terms of which became at once known throughout the town, accused the Sadr Azam and his friends of being the authors of the ruin of the country. He was interrupted again and again, not by the Sadr Azam, but by his henchman, the Minister of the Court, wdio protested that such words were treason. The bold speaker was sent off on a distant mission, the Minister of Commerce, who had openly protested at various times against the administration of M. Nans, was exiled, and order was outwardly restored. In the middle of May the Shah had a paralytic stroke, and was incapacitated from business. The news which reached him was edited by the reactionary Minister of the Court, the confederate of the Prime Minister. It was felt that little was to be gained by a personal appeal to His Majesty, and with the Shah’s departure to thecountry in the middle of June a lull ensued in the agitation. This period of calm lasted until the first week in July, when the principal Mujteheds began preaching in the mosques against the Grand Vizier and inciting the people to revolt. On the 11th the Grand Vizier ordered the arrest of a well-known preacher, an elderly Seyed. A woman who was passing reported the arrest to the people and a rescue was attempted. The officer in command of the troops ordered them to fire on the mob, and, on their refusing, fired himself and killed a Seyed on the spot. The mob then tried to rush the guard-house, and four volleys were fired by the soldiers, wounding a number of the attacking party. After a short fight the soldiers were routed. The body of the Seyed was taken to a neighbouring mosque, where a large crowd collected, and messages were sent to the neighbouring Mujteheds, who shortly arrived with a large following. The bazaars were closed and the streets full of men wearing winding-sheets, to show that they were ready to fight to the death, and of women beating their breasts and cursing the Government. The Grand Vizier and the Commander-in-chief went to Tehran, escorted by a large body of cavalry. A council was held, at which it was decided to use force. Troops were picketed in the bazaars, and a Royal Proclamation was issued condemning the agitation and asking the Clerical party to formulate their grievances, but stating that the Grand Vizier would not be dismissed. The 12th July brought no change in the situation. The crowds remained posted round the great mosque, which was occupied by the Mujteheds. On the 13th a number of people began beating their breasts and shouting “ Hassan, Hussein ! ” They surrounded a pole bearing the blood-stained shirt of the murdered Seyed and paraded it through the bazaars. The soldiers tried to stop the procession, and finally fired, killing and wounding many. The bodies were carried away by the soldiers and buried in a pit near the town. The news was brought to the mosque, where the Mujtehed Seyed Abdullah was preaching. Holding up the Koran, he read the Shah’s message to the people, and said that their demand for justice had been met by bullets. From the 13th to the 15th July the Mujteheds remained in the mosque, which was closely surrounded by soldiers, so that supplies were only received by stealth and with difficulty. At last the Government gave permission to the Mujteheds to retire, on condition that they were not accompanied by the people. On the 15th they left the city and passed the night at a mosque on the Kum road. From there they issued a declaration threatening, if the Shah did not fulfil his promise and introduce reforms and dismiss the Grand Vizier, to proceed in a body to the holy places, and thus leave the capital without religious guidance and without the possibility of carrying out any legal transactions. It appeared as if the Government had won the day. The town was in the hands of the troops. The popular leaders had fled. The Shah was in the hands of their opponents. For the popular party the outlook was a grave one. It was shown that even the death of a descendant of the Prophet and the sanctity of a mosque were no deterrents to their enemies. It was true that the mosque was not invaded by the troops, but it was surrounded, and no supplies were allowed to pass through. The bazaars were in the occupation of the soldiers, and there appeared to be no place of refuge. Under these circumstances they had recourse to an expedient sanctified by old and, indeed, immemorial custom—the rule of “ bast.” In 1348 the chief persons of the Empire had taken refuge with the English and Russian Legations in order to obtain the exile of the tyrannical Minister Mirza Aghassi, and since then it had been the custom of persons who had grievances against their own Government to take refuge under the shelter of a foreign Legation. Quite recently the Sheikh-ul-Reis, a, prominent preacher, had taken “ bast ” at the Turkish Embassy and had only left it under a safe conduct, which remains in the hands of the Turkish Ambassador. It was resolved, failing all other resources, to adopt this expedient. On the 9th July, that is, before the killing of the Seyed and the arrest of the preacher, which took place on the 11th, Agha Seyed Abdullah, the most energetic, but not the most incorruptible, of the Mujteheds, addressed a letter to Mr. Grant Duff applying for the active assistance of His Majesty’s Legation. Acting under instructions, Mr. Grant Duff replied that it was quite impossible for His Majesty’s Legation in any way to support a movement directed against the Government of the Shah. On the 16th, that is, after the events above described, the Agha addressed another letter to Mr. Grant Duff on the eve of his departure, telling’ him that, in order to prevent the further effusion of blood, the Mujteheds were leaving the city for the holy places, and expressing the hope that they would have his sympathy in their struggle against cruelty and oppression. [1072] B 2Two days afterwards, on the 18th July, two persons calle X '^S^the Gulahek, 7 miles from town, and asked whether, m case t e P®°P ^ 0 fthe military British Legation at Tehran, the Charge d’Affaires would to remove them or prevent their friends from lepaumg JL to^such an Mr. Grant Duff expressed the hope that they wouM 110 % 1 ^ e custom expedient, but he said that it was not m his power, m view of ¥ ge t J , in Persia Lnd the immemorial right of “ bast,” to use, or cause to be used, toice to expel them if they came. Mr. Grant Duff at once informed the Mmister for *°^ign • mis, who, however, seemed to regard the matter with some satisfaction. At any a , nothing 1 was done to prevent what followed. i i t 4 . 1 On the evening of the 9th fifty Mullahs and merchants appeared at the Legation and took up-their quarters for the night. Their numbers soon increased and on le 2nd September there were about 14,000 persons m the Legation gaulen Their conduct was most orderly. The crowd of refugees was organized by the heads of the guilds, who took measures to prevent any unauthorized person from entering the Legation grounds. Tents were put up and regular feeding places and times of feeding were provided for. The expense was borne by the principal merchants. No damage of a wilful character was done to the garden although, of course, every semblance of a bed was trampled out of existence, and the trees still bear pious inscriptions cut in the bark. Colonel Douglas, the ^Military Attache, kept watc i over the Legation buildings, but no watch was needed. Discipline and order were maintained by the refugees themselves. ., 1 The Government sent answers to the popular demands, which they requested Mr. Grant Duff to read to the people. The Government communications were received with derision. At last there appeared to be no other icsource than a personal appeal to the Shah. The people stated thinly that unless then demands were granted they would remain in the Legation, as it w r as their only place of s itety, and they maintained that until the Shah knew what was the real situation then requests would never receive due consideration. Mr. Grant Duff obtained the consent ot His Majesty’s Government, and announced to the Minister for horeign Affairs that he demanded an audience. An audience was fixed lor the 30th July, the audience, however, never took place. The Gommander of several ot the Tehran regiments, on whom the Minister of the Court and the Grand Vizier chiefly depended, made the fatal announcement that his troops would not serve against the people, and that they were on the point of themselves taking refuge in the British Legation. The Court party yielded. The Sadr Azam resigned, and the Azad-ul-Mulk, head of the Kajar tribe, proceeded to Kum in order to inform the refugee Mullahs that the Shah had granted their demands for a National Assembly and lor Courts oi Justice. The chief difficulty which then confronted Mr. Grant Duff was that the people had entirely lost confidence in their own Government, and declined to treat with them except through the British Bepresentative. When the Government made the announcement of the projected reforms, the people answered that they would not accept the promise of the Government unless it was confirmed and guaranteed by the Government of the King of England. This was naturally impossible. Acting under instructions, Mr. Grant Duff 1 informed the refugees that he could do no more for them, and entirely declined to guarantee the execution of the Shah’s Decrees. The Government then attempted to come to an arrangement direct. It failed. The popular leaders rejected the Shah’s Decrees as vague or inadequate, and where posted up in the city they were torn down and trampled on. In this extremity the Govern ment again appealed to Mr. Grant Duff and begged him for his assistance. At his suggestion a meeting took place at the residence of the new Grand Vizier, the late Minister for Foreign Affairs, between the Government and the popular leaders. After a lono' discussion, at which Mr. Grant Duff took no part except whev 0 I - gees and was received with enthusiasm. The same day the Mullahs consented to return from Kum, and the Legation premises were vacated. On the night of the 16th the Mujteheds returned amid the popular plaudits, and on the 18th a grand meeting was held in the Palace precincts as a sort of earnest of the National Assembly. The proceedings were opened by the Sheikh whose arrest had been the beginning of the struggle for freedom, who, standing on a raised platform, declared the Assembly in Session. On the 19th a memorable meeting took place between the returned Mujteheds and the The Monarch was treated as an equal by the two chief priests, in the presence Shah.5 of A considerable conconrse of Mullahs, and when His Majesty expressed his gracious wish that they “ would continue to serve him,” they replied, in the hearing of the bystanders, that they did not serve him, but themselves and the nation. But the reactionary party had not lost hope, and the next week was spent in gradually paring down all the Shah’s promises, and in the production of a Bescript in which the original proiect of the Constitution was hardly recognizable. The late Grand Vizier, who had lingered in the neighbourhood, suddenly returned to his country seat near the Shah’s residence, and the Shah absolutely refused to sign the Ttegulations for the Assembly. The popular excitement was intense. Notice was served on Mr. Grant Huff that the people would again take refuge in the Legation, if necessary, by force. About twenty-five of the leaders actually did take up their quarters there. It seemed as it the disturbances were about to break out anew. Under these circumstances Mr. Grant Huff, in compliance with the instructions sent him from London, called on the Ttussian Minister and invited Ins co-operation m bringing the matter to the serious attention o£ the Persian Government. The Minister agreed to make representations, hue demurred to any joint action. The result, however, of the separate action taken by the two Legations was that the late Sadr Azam was ordered to proceed to Khorassan, and the ^Regulations for the Assembly were signed and published. The victory wns now won, and it only remained to publish the Regulations throughout the Empire in order that the elections might be held at once. This most of the Governors refused to do, and, as a protest, the popular leaders at Tabreez, Besht, and Meshed threatened to take bast in the British Consulates. Sir C. Spring-Bice had now arrived, and, acting in obedience to instructions, he telegraphed to our Consuls to dissuade the leadeis, if possible, fiom appealing to British officials in their differences with their own Government, and at the same time he made private and unofficial representations to the Persian Govern ment. The movement gradually calmed down, and the provincial elections were held in comparative quiet. In the meanwhile it had been decided, in order to avoid delay, that the Tehran Members, of the Council should meet at once, without waiting for the provincial Delegates, and the first Session of the new Assembly was^ opened by the Shah himself, in the presence of the priests, the Court, and the foreign Bepiesenta- tives. The Delegates at once set to work, and it soon beca.me apparent that they did not intend to allow their will to be neglected. Their opposition made it impossible for the Government to accept the financial assistance offered jointly by Bussia and England. The Assembly. On the 7th October the Assembly was formally opened by the Shah in person. It consisted of the representatives of Tehran (sixty-four Membeis, elected by class representation). The provincial Members arrived one by one as they were elected, and as yet there are many vacant places, the provinces not showing much alacrity m electing their Members. The Assembly soon showed its power. It refused absolutely to consent to the Anglo-Bussian advance, on the ground that the public revenues ought not to be pledged to foreigners. It announced its intention of instituting reforms, especially in the finances of the country, and of providing itself the necessary funds for carrying on the Government by founding and endowing a National Bank. But, before taking any steps of this nature, it insisted on having a signed Constitution. A Committee was nominated to consider the terms of the Constitution, and, in consul tation with a Committee named by the Government, a Constitution was drawn up and submitted to the Chamber. A scene of great confusion resulted, the people jommg in. It was freely stated that the popular cause had been betrayed, and some of the more prominent Members resigned. The Mujteheds, however, interposed and effected a reconciliation, and finally Government and Chamber came to an agreement. Owing, it was said, to the Valiahd’s personal exertions, the Constitution was finally signed and read to the Assembly by the Prime Minister, amid a scene of great enthusiasm. So far the Chamber, although it has proved its power, has not carried out any practical reform, nor has it been found possible to collect sufficient funds to establish the National Bank, so that it is by no means certain whether the country will really be able, as the Assembly maintains, to pay its way without foreign assistance. I he prevalent tone at present is one of doubt and distrust, although the leaders still declare their conviction that the independence of the country, which of course depends largely on its financial solvency, can be saved. A marked anti-foreign feeling is now developing, and the Chamber is now engaged in attacking the Belgium Customs^ Administration, the Cossack brigade, and the various foreign Concessions. The Imperial Bank will no [1072] ^ °doubt be soon the object of severe animadversions owing to its possession of the right of issuing paper money. It certainly looks as it the populai nio\ emen w ou ( iesa , or the time at least, in affecting for the worse the position of foreigners. No. 4. Sir C.

I HAVE the honour to state that/ His Imperial Majesty the Valiahd arrived in Tehran on the 16th ultimo. For some time intrigues had been carried on in the Palace, chiefly by the Shoa-es-Saltaneh and the Minister of the Court, to prevent his departure from Tabreez. They had not, however, money enough to pay the troops, and were unable, owing to the resistance of the Sadrazam, to obtain possession of the proposed advance promised by England and Russia, and moreover the Shoa’s unpopularity eclipsed even that of the Valiahd, who on his part did not fail to send conciliatory messages to the popular leaders. It was also known that the Endishand Russian Legations would refuse their support to any reactionary movement, and had already acknowledged the Yaliahd as the legitimate successor of the Shah. As a consequence, Avhen the Shah’s illness took a more serious turn, and the hopes which the arrival of the German doctor had given rise to gave place to the conviction that His Majesty’s days were numbered, the Shoas party collapsed, and the Shah was induced to order the Yaliahd to proceed to Tehran. As soon as possible after receiving the Shah’s orders the Yaliahd started for Tehran, leaving Tabreez on the 4th December. He took with him all the armed horsemen he could collect, 400 in number, and most of his Persian suite. Of the foreign members of it, only M. Cavre, the French veterinary surgeon, accompanied the Prince. The Russian Minister applied for an audience on the Yaliahd’s arrival, and His Imperial Highness instructed the Minister for Foreign Affairs to inform the heads of Missions that he would receive them separately with their staffs according to their diplomatic precedence. The Yaliahd’s language to myself and to the members of His Majesty’s Legation was most friendly. I studiously avoided politics, but His Imperial Highness of his own accord made two very friendly allusions to the new Assembly and the Parliamentary regime which his father had sanctioned. With regard to the Yaliahd’s attitude towards the constitutional movement, he has been careful to express his sympathy in the most open and formal manner, and although it is generally believed he is opposed in heart to popular liberties, he has certainly done all in his power to counteract this impression by accepting the Constitu tion without demur. I am informed that he is convinced that, for the present at any rate, a good understanding with his people is the only alternative, and I am inclined to believe that the wise and temperate advice of the Russian Minister has also con tributed to the peaceful solution of what at one time threatened to be a dangerous conflict. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. No. 9. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Greys—(Received January 21.) gi r Tehran, January 3, 1907. THE Persian National Assembly is not fully constituted, as only a few of the provincial Members have arrived. There is a good deal of opposition among the local Governors, and, in some cases, reluctance on the part of the electors or the Delegates. Up till now there have been no regular rules or orders of the day. Ihe Members sit on the floor in a circle, the President at the end of the room before a low desk , the great Mujteheds, who are always present and take an active part, though not Members, sitting opposite. Any Member may speak on any subject, and a conclusion is rarely arrived at. The public are admitted into the room where the debates are held, and are allowed to interrupt and even to speak. This inconvenience, however, is being gradually diminished. On the whole, order is well maintained, and the proceedings aie quiet and dignified. The chief subjects of discussion have been the Bank Charter and the Constitution. As the first action taken by the Assembly was to prohibit the foreign loan, it became its duty to provide funds for the Government. This it was proposed to arrange for by the establishment of a national bank, for which popular subscriptions were invited. . e subscriptions which are promised cannot be converted into cash without some definite security, which it is hoped to provide by means of a Charter. On this subject discussions with the Government are still proceeding. Owing to the Concession for the issue of bank-notes possessed by the Imperial Bank of Persia, this resource is not available, and in its place it is proposed that the bank should have the right to collect and receive the interior revenues, or “ maliat.” The Government is still negotiating with the pimeipa merchants, and the question is still unsettled. ^ t . A more important question was that of the Constitution. Until the Constitution was formallv accepted by the Government nothing definite could be dene, and there was a constant fear of disorder. It was rumoured that the Yaliahd was hostile, and it was certain that the Court party would do all in its power to prevent the Shah from giving his sDnature. It was consequently a great relief when one of tlie principal [1072] B 4Muiteheds read a letter from His Imperial Highness denying in the most formal manner the sinister intentions attributed to him. On his arrival at Tehran a deputation ot the Members waited on him and reported that his language was most conciliatory, lie was now Regent, and appointed a Committee to represent the Government and discuss with a Committee nominated by the Assembly the whole question of the Constitution.^ An aoreement was arrived at and made known to the Assembly. When, however, it appeared that there was to be a second House, of which the Government had the power to nominate the majority, there was a great outcry, in which the Saad-ed-Dow leh took a leading part. The President was insulted and hardly accorded a hearing, and, with some of his friends, retired from the Assembly and expressed his intention ot resigning. It was believed, and I think with some reason, that certain persons^ who weie interested in the break-up of the Assembly had freely expended money to insure that • result, and their tactics were for some time successful. But an appeal was made with success to the patriotism of the Members, and the President was induced to withdraw his resignation. A compromise was at last arrived at, and on the 1st Januaiy the Sadr Azam appeared in the Assembly with the Constitution in his hands, signed by the Shah, the Valiahd, and himself, which, amid a scene of great enthusiasm, was solemnly read to the Assembly and the public. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. No. 10. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 6.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 0, 1907. ALTHOUGH a revolutionary movement no doubt exists here, and although there is, I think, a strong movement against the Government, against the Belgian Customs Administration, against foreign loans and Concessions, and against foreign political influence in general, so far there does not appear to be any general anti- Christian and anti-foreign movement likely to endanger person or property. But though not dangerous at present, the anti-foreign movement may become so if foreign Governments take an active part in internal politics. My advice would be that such interference should be avoided by His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government as long as possible (though Russia’s position, owing to the Caucasus, differs from ours), but that both Powers should have plans ready on paper for financial or military measures in case the defence of European lives and property should render such measures absolutely necessary.

Spring-Rice in deprecating intervention in the internal affairs of Persia, and you mav so inform the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. &gt; The view held by His Majesty’s Government is that any proposals for measures of a military nature would be opposed to the principle of non-intervention. No. 12. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey—(Received February 12.) (Telegraphic.) ^ St. Petersburgh, February 12, 1907. MINISTER foi Foreign Affairs told me to-day that the following is the policy of the Russian Government.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 18.) g| r Tehran, January 27, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the Persian Constitu tion which has been prepared by Mr. Churchill. It provides for a National Assembly, composed of from 160 to 200 Members, chosen by popular election, and of a Senate of sixty Members, halt of whom are elected and half nominated by the Government. The Assembly is elected for two years, and the Shah, by a separate Rescript, has promised not to dissolve it before the expiration of its first term. After the first term it can be dissolved on a motion passed by two-thirds of the Senate and approved by the Shah. The Members take oath, “ so long as the rights of the Assembly are respected, to be loyal to the Sovereign and the rights of the nation.” The Ministers, who are appointed by the Sovereign, can be summoned before the Assembly to give explanations as to their conduct of atlairs, and are made responsible to the Assembly for any derogation of the powers or infraction of the laws. 1 hey can address the Assembly on the invitation of the President, and have the right of proposing Bills in person. The Assembly must give its consent before any concession is granted, or loan foreign or internal is concluded, and must be consulted as to any Treaty with a foreign Power, except such arrangements as, in the opinion of the Government, should be kept secret in the public interest. It has control of all financial matters, and must gb e its consent before the Budget is passed or any new tax is instituted. Ihe Senate has concurrent legislative power, except in financial matters, on which, however, it appeals to have the right of veto. _ . , In case of disagreement between the two Plouses, a joint Committee is appointed, and if an agreement is not arrived at, the Senate can by two-thirds majority require the dissolution of the Assembly, provided that this does not take place more than once in the two years’ term. _ General powers of examination into the conduct of affairs by the Government and of direct access to the Shah are provided for. The Members are inviolable, and10 the proceedings are public, with certain reservations as to the proceedings of secret Committees, ^ proceedings and 0 f comment, provided this is not of a '^“^t^^Eon is carried into effect the Persian Govern ment is now a limited Monarchy, the Ministers however, although responsiH conduct to the Assembly, being nominated by the Sovereign and ^ j , the The powers of the Assembly include financial control, and no loan can be made by Government without its consent. 1 have, &amp;c.

Spring-Ricc to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February IS.) gj r Tehran, January 30, 1907. AS I had the honour to inform you by telegraph, the Shall died at 10'30 p.m. on the Sth instant. No disorders took plnce in the city, as His Majesty had been for some time in a hopeless condition, and the Regency had been assumed by his son. The next day the body was removed to the Court Theatre, where the Persian passion plays are performed in Moharrem, and was there deposited pending removal to its permanent resting place. The last wishes of the Shah were that his body should be buried not in Persia but in Kerbela, but this wish meets with much opposition on account of the popularity of the “ father of Persian liberties,” and the inordinate expense of the removal.15 On the 10th instant the Diplomatic Body attended at the Palace to express to the Grand Vizier the condolences of their respective Governments. On the 13th we were invited, in uniform, to congratulate the new Shah on his accession, and to pay our respects to his late Majesty. We were received in a small apartment decorated with the pictures of various foreign Sovereigns. The accommodation was small, and the Diplomatic Body was compressed into the smallest possible compass. His Majesty appeared, and was greeted by the Turkish Ambassador with an address ot‘ congratula tion, which was, as appeared, rather coldly received. A Chamberlain then pointed out the various heads of Missions, each of whom was saluted by His Majesty by a slight nod. His Majesty then departed, and we proceeded to the theatre, in which his late Majesty was temporarily interred. After a moment s delay the Turkish Ambassador offered a prayer, the Christian Representatives standing behind him, and the Diplomatic Body then made its departure. The coronation of the new Shah, who assumes the Crown under the title of Mohammed Ali Shah, took place on the 20th. The Diplomatic Body was invited to take part, although I understand this was against the first intentions of the Government. Tne Persian Ministers and the Diplomatists were ranged on either side of the room, at the end of which was the throne, miscalled the peacock throne of Delhi. The veritable peacock throne, or what remains of it, was placed on one side of the room and was not occupied, Th§ splendour of the jewels which decorated it excited universal remark. Bound the throne, or rather raised bed, which the Shah was to ascend, were ranged the Princes of the blood, standing, and the chief Mujteheds, sitting on the ground. It had been explained to the heads of Missions, who had concurred, that on such an occasion the highest honours should be accorded to the representatives of the clergy. The Shah entered and walked up the room accompanied by the Sadr Azam and grand officers of the Court. His son, the heir, a little boy of 12, took his place at the steps of the throne, which His Majesty ascended. I he Mujteheds then rose to their feet and, in the name of £&lt; the All-merciful and All-bountiful, hailed him as Shah of Persia. The Sadr Azam then ascended the steps and placed on his head the enormous crown, shaped like a melon, and adorned by the spoils won by Nadir Shah from India, with which his father bad been crowned. It was observed that its great weight and size were of considerable inconvenience to His Majesty, who was obliged to support it with his hands. It was then removed, and its place was taken by an ordinary Persian hat, adorned, however, with the famous aigrette which is now so familiar in Europe, and which Nadir Shah obtained from the Emperor of Delhi. # # The Court Herald and the Court Poet then advanced, and in turn presented their homage, the former saluting him in the name of his ancestors whom he enumerated, with their respective titles. A crowd of Ministers and courtiers then pressed forward, and the throne was surrounded by Princes, priests, and others, who all presented^ their congratulations at once, which the Shah, sitting cross-legged above them, graciously acknowledged. The Shah then descended the throne and addressed himself one by one to the foreign Representatives. The Russian Minister and I then seized the opportunity of conveying to His Majesty the felicitations of our Sovereigns on the nomination of Sultan Ahmed Mirza as Valiahd. His Majesty told me, with evident satisfaction, that he had that morning received a personal' telegram from the King. He then left the apartment. _ . The next day the public “ salaam ” took place in the Palace. The minor officials of the Empire were admitted to the garden, and after some delay the Shah appeared, preceded by the famous jewelled shield, and took his seat cross-legged on the marble throne, which is on the first storey of the Palace, in an open window, and visible from below. There he smoked a kalian before the assembled people, and listened to a complimentary ode of the Court Poet. After a few minutes delay he retiled to his inner apartments. On this occasion gold coins, struck for the occasion, were presented to certain persons, including some of the foreign ladies. On the 25th took place the ceremony of the killing of the sacrificial camel, after which the Shah in the presence of his Court solemnly acknowledged his second son as Valiahd. Some remarks have been made in the Assembly on the subject of these ceremonies. Representatives of the Assembly were not asked to be present at the coronation, though a deputation of six were invited to witness the proclamation of the Vahahd. It was asked whether the Shah had sworn to the Constitution. After some delay, oneof the Mujteheds observed that, Constitution.” u We crowned His IViajesty with the crown of the I IdcIVO &amp;C* (Signed) 5 CECIL SPRINGHUCE. No. 17. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey—{Received February 18.) (Extract.) Tehran, January 30, 1907. I REGRET to state that the prospects of a good understanding between the Shah and the popular party are still remote, the entourage ol the Shah, especially his tather- in-law, the Naib-es-Sultaneh, is personally interested in the continuance of the existing abuses; and their influence has certainly made itself felt to a regrettable extent, and lias led to increasing agitation against the Shah himself. On the other hand the action of the popular Assembly has not been such as to lead to conciliation. The Members seem bent on raising every sort of difficulty, and they do not appear to desire to lighten the task of the Government or provide funds for carrying on their administration of the country. The Government, on its side, adopts a hostile or reserved attitude towards the Assembly, and in consequence the relations between the two parties have steadily become worse. The information which reaches me is conflicting. The older men, who have long been connected with the Government, maintain that a conflict is inevitable. Members of the Parliamentary party assure rne that an attempt on the State’s part to overthrow the Assembly will result in a general strike, and in all probability in serious disorders. They do not, however, believe that the troops will take an active part against the people if ltd, as is probable, by the chief religious authorities. There is no doubt that there is some agitation in the bazaars, and a pronounced anti-dynastic and revolutionary movement in some parts of the country, especially Tabreez and Resht. Local Assemblies have been organized in the chief capitals which are giving the Government a good deal of anxiety, for they appear to aim at a sorb of local autonomy, and the Governors are powerless to deal with them. 'the alternatives which are now before us appear to be— 1. An agreement between Shah and people resulting in practical reforms. 2. A conflict. 1 have already called your attention to the growth of an anti-foreign feeling which is especially noticeable in the Medjliss. This takes the form of a strongly developed fear of both England and Russia, and especially of the two combined. Any accen tuation of this combination, or any overt sign of co-operation, is regarded as aimed directly at the independence of Persia. No. 18. Sir C.

(Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. Inclosure in No. 18. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. Tabreez. NIZAM-UL-MULK took over the Governorship of labreez early m January, and Imam Kuli Muza pioceeded to take up the Governorship of Urmia. Nizam-ul-Mulk[ 1072 ] G found the local “Enjumen,” or Assembly, so hostile that he complained to the Shah. The matter was brought up by Seyed Abdullah at the Tehran Assembly, but the Deputies upheld the “Enjumen.” The Kurds have committed a fresh outrage near Urmia. They killed a certain Alijan Beg, of Jenislu, near Urmia, whose family took refuge under the British flag at the English Mission. Four hundred of the inhabitants of Urmia also went to the Mission, wailing and beating their breasts, but did not remain. Others went to the telegraph ofiice and did some damage. The state of Urmia during the past year has been such as cannot possibly be allowed to repeat itself in 1907, if the Persian Government has the slightest regard for the welfare of the peaceful population of the district. On the 29th December the inhabitants of Urmia killed in the bazaar three apparently innocent Kurds from Solduz who had come to sell their corn in the town. Much excitement ensued, as reprisals were expected. A military expedition was sent by the Persian Government against the Kurds ot Bend on the 5th instant, and the village was destroyed, with a loss to the Persian side of four men killed. The Kurdish loss is unknown, but Imam Kuli Mirza, who started for Urmia on the 9th instant, informed Mr. Wratislaw that it vms probably very small. He intends to lead an imposing expedition against the Kurds in the spring, and seemed quite confident that he would be able to overcome them. There is, however, still the danger of a great Kurdish raid, as on previous occasions, and the safety of the English missionaries is by no means assured, though the presence of Imam Kuli Mirza there is likely to give confidence. He is well known to Mr. Wratislaw, who has a good opinion of him. The twelve Tabreez Deputies left for Tehran on the 8th instant. Thousands of the inhabitants of the town saw them off, and a rather impressive function took place at the bridge, when the Koran was solemnly produced, on which last September an oath was taken by the leading men of the town to maintain the popular cause. The Bussian Hoad Administration is experiencing considerable difficulty in collecting its tolls, particularly from the inhabitants of villages along the road, who manifest a profound objection to the additional tax which is imposed upon them, as they consider the old road was quite good enough for their purposes. Befusals to pay the tolls have resulted in frequent scuffles, and generally in the escape of the delinquents. A detachment of horsemen, supplied by the Governor for the protection of the road officials, was beaten by the villagers and sent back to Tabreez. The hostility of all classes to the Hoad Company is very marked. JResht. The Governor-General stated that his authority was set at naught, and over 3,000/. of taxes were outstanding and not likely to be paid. He expected bloodshed. The “ Fedavis ” have two Associations at Besht, one public and one secret. They are under the authority of directing bodies in the Caucasus. The attitude of the reform party in Besht is distinctly revolutionary, and gives some anxiety at Tehran. It is partly due to the weakness of the Governor, Vezir Akrem, a chamberlain of the late Shah’s. He v T as severely rebuked by the Shah, and Sepahdar v ; as appointed U succeed him, but the Tehran Assembly opposed his nomination. On the occasion of the festivities in connection with the Shah’s coronation the inhabitants of Besht refused to take part without orders from the Tehran Assembly. Seyed Mohammed Mujtehed sent them a reassuring telegram as to the Shahs attitude towards the Constitution, and they only then consented to show their loyalty by decorating the bazaars, illuminating, &amp;c. Ispahan, Mr. Barnhani reports on the Ispahan elections, which appear to have been directed by Agha Nejefi with a view to his interests being protected in the Tehran Assembly. In tlm meantime the local Assembly has arrogated to itself the government of the province under the presidency of Sheikh Norullah. It meets twice a-week, and interferes in every matter, and produces general distrust and confusion. Shiraz, A local Assembly has been formed, composed of about thirty members drawn from Various classes. They have so far not shown much activity. Ihe news of the Shahs death caused no trouble. Tehran^ January 31, 1907. (Signed) G. P. CHUBCHILL.Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received March 18.) tv * Tehran, February 24, 1907. A YEAR ago the popular movement against the Belgian Customs Administration, and especially against M. Nans, assumed such serious proportions that M. -Nans considered that it would be unsafe to remain in the country, and he accordingly Jett on a mission to Constantinople. On his return last autumn, the popular movement was directed more especially against the Sadr-i-Azam and the existing state of the Govern ment, and, though his removal was made one of the popular demands, it was not considered so important or so urgent as the other parts of the reform piogramme. lie was able to obtain the exile of his principal enemy, the Saad-ed-Dowleh, and he was invited to St. Petersburg!! to assist in the loan negotiations which were to take place there in September. The Persian Government, however, refused to intrust him with the negotiations, and he remained in Persia. The Saad-ed-Dowleh was allowed to return to Tehran, and, as soon as the new Assembly was formed, he renewed the agitation against the Belgian Customs Administration. The leader of the Moderate party, the Sani-ed-Dowleh, President of the Assembly, did his best to put a stop to the agitation, and, indeed, threatened at one time to resign his post if the Assembly persisted in its demands. The popular feeling, however, was so strong that, although the majority of the Assembly were probably in their hearts of the Sani-ed-Dowleh’s opinion, they were forced to yield. The first question at issue was whether or not M. Naus was a responsible Minister. There was no doubt that he had been intrusted by the late Grand Vizier with the general financial control of the Empire. He had been made Controller of the Sanduk, or Imperial Treasury, into which all public funds were payable, and, in addition to his autocratic management of the Customs Administration—for which he was only respon sible to the Sadr-i-Azam—he had also control of the Posts and the Mint. When, however, the Assembly demanded from the Government a reply to their request for information as to the general conduct of affairs—especially financial affairs—by the Shah’s Ministers, M. Naus did not appear before the Assembly. The Finance Minister, the Nasr-ul-Mulk, stated, in reply to the Assembly’s questions, that he had no powers of control, but was simply an accountant. M. Naus, he said, was not responsible to him, and, indeed, had not even provided him with the accounts of the Customs Administration for the last three years. The Assembly was accordingly placed in an embarrassing position. It demanded information, and the person responsible for the principal paying Administration of the Empire was out of its reach. It accordingly asked to be supplied with a list of responsible Ministers. The Sadr-i-Azam sent the list, and it did not contain the name of M. Naus. The Assembly accordingly demanded that if M. Naus was not a responsible Minister he should be deprived of the title which he had assumed and of the powers of control, to which, according to the Constitution, he had- no right. After some days of hesitation, during which the popular excitement reached a dangerous height, the Shah yielded, and issued a Decree removing M. Naus and M. Priem from their posts of Minister and Director-General of the Customs. The popular delight found expression in loyal addresses and manifestations of triumph. I have, &amp;c.

IN the course of the last month the Assembly has tried conclusions with the Sovereign, and has been markedly successful. It demanded the dismissal of M. Naus and M. Priem, the two principal Belgian employes of the Government, and the formal recognition of the fact that the Persian Monarchy was “ constitutional” and “ limited.” Both demands were complied with. I understand that the Shah was induced to yield by the alarming news which reached him from all quarters—especially from Tabreez—as to the probable conse-[ 1072 ] 19 quences of a refusal on his part. It is also stated that His Majesty has received warnings to the. effect that an r association of “ fedavi,” or “ devoted persons,” exists with the avowed object of imitating 1 the policy of the ancient Persian sect of assassins. The Assembly showed much determination. The Members waited all day, mostly in silence, for the Shah’s answer, and refused to allow any, one to leave the House until its arrival, which did not take place till late in the evening. In the garden outside the House a crowd of about 3,000 persons waited all day in perfect order, and on the arrival of the Shah’s messenger burst into prolonged cheers. The merchants were prepared to - close the bazaars, and constant telegraphic communication was kept up with the popular leaders in the provinces. I he arrival of the Deputies from labreez was the signal for a great popular manifestation, and they were given almost royal honours. I am told by an eye-witness that the approaches of their lodgings were crowded with an eager throng waiting for an opportunity of kissing their garments. The great Mujteheds, although their popular sympathies are supposed to be luke warm, have also played their part, and sermons have been preached in the mosques appealing to the patriotism of the Persian people. ^ It is clear that a national movement of a semi-political and semi-religious character does exist and is spreading. The great Mujteheds of Kerbela are now entering on the scene, and delegates are being sent out from the capital to the provinces to preach the principles of liberty. . . . Patriotism, of a distinctive Persian type, has always been the characteristic of tlm Shiite believers. The present Shah of Persia has no religious status, and, in the view of the religious leaders, no fundamental right to the allegiance of the Persians, whose real chief is no living King, but the twelfth Imam, the coming Messiah, even now present on the earth, though unseen. The patriotism of the Shiite does not therefore centre m -the., person of the Kaliph, but is, or can be, of a highly revolutionary character. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-BICE. No. 21.

PARVIZ SHAHJEHAN, a well-known and respected merchant of Yezd, was nurdered by an unknown person on or about the 11 th mstent at Yezd The Parsees, Ithouoh very numerous at Yezd, do not enjoy the same prmleges as Mahommedans t w«s°quite possible that, even if the murderer were arrested, the local clergy would rot allow hbn to be punished in the event of his proving to be a Mahommedan. Pis Majesty’s Minister, who received telegrams from various influential Parsees m ndia lost no time in making representations, in an unofficial capacity to some ot . his Sends amonc the chief priests at Tehran. Seyed Mohammed, one of the pnncpal Vlujteheds, showed that he fully realized the unfortunate consequences which such ncidents ^ould bring about if repeated or if the perpetrators were uppupished. He herefore sent a telegram to the chief priests of Yezd urging t em o J :o the punishment ot the criminal. He at the same time strongly urged the badr Azam X) insist upon the capture of the murdereiv j t 1 tvowq rpqnectinp- In connection with the incident reported farther on under Ispahan ^ws, l^pec.t,n| ■he action taken by Agha Nejefi and the local Assembly against the Jew.-,, His Maje y20 Minister lias, in concert with his French colleague, remonstrated with the Persian Government. . - . . . . . On the 19th instant two or three prominent preachers raised their voices m the mosques and elsewhere against the Assembly. They said that the laws of the Koian were sufficient for Moslems, and that all true believers must protest against the introduc tion of the laws of the infidels. The Mujteheds immediately pressed foi the anest and expulsion of the preachers, who, however, took sanctuary at bhahabdulazim. On the 25th instant there were over eighty persons in sanctuary at Shahabdulazim, and their numbers are now said to have increased to over 300. Tabreez. After the bombardment of the Kurdish village named Bend by the Government troops, as reported last month, a number of the baser inhabitants of Urumia proceeded to the village to plunder, and carried off everything portable, down to the wood used in the construction of the houses. A dozen of them stayed too long, and were killed by the returning Kurds. The feeling between Shiahs and Sunnis in the Urumia district is now very bitter. The attitude of the Kurds is threatening in the extreme, though the season is against depredations on a large scale, but the inhabitants of Bend are now homeless, and must make a living. The relatives of the late Alijan Beg still hang around the English Mission, and are afraid to return to their village. Mr. Parry assured Mr. Wratislaw that he and his colleagues of the English Mission are quite safe, but those of the American Mission who live in their college a mile or more from the town run con siderable risk. American interest in those regions are now in the hands of their own Consul at Tabreez, who has now reached his post. The position of the “ Enjumen ” (local Assembly) hardly seems so secure as it was, nor its popularity so general. The members have had several violent quarrels among themselves, while the senior clergy of the town are adopting an attitude of sullen hostility towards an institution which deprives them of much of their importance and emoluments. The landed proprietors, too, find their interests directly menaced by the action of the “ Enjumen” in causing the prices of grain and meat to be reduced, and the mercantile and lower classes can alone be considered as whole hearted supporters of the Committee which was at one time so popular. In a recent number of the Tabreez “ Adalet ” newspaper, a long and violent attack w r as published against the Belgian Customs Administration. The native bankers have combined to boycott the notes of the Imperial Bank of Persia. They organized a run on the bank at the beginning of February, and very few notes were left in circulation. Ispahan. Agha Nejefi, in conversation with the First Munshi of the Consulate-General, talked of the necessity of forcing the Jews, Armenians, and even the Europeans of Ispahan to adopt habits and customs more consonant with the respect due by them to Moslems. The Jews w~ere in great trouble at Ispahan at the beginning of February because they had been summoned before the local Assembly and compelled to sign a self-denying Ordinance providing (l) that no Jew should in future sell wine or spirits to a Moslem ; (2) that no Jew should hawk goods for sale within a radius of 8 miles from Ispahan. It may be that the prohibition to sell liquor is right, but to forbid the Jew to take his pack to Julfa or to the villages would ruin him. Half of the Jews of Ispahan are devoted to this trade and do nothing else. The motive for the new Begulation is said to be the excessive freedom with which Jews have hitherto been allowed to enter Moslem houses and carry their goods into the amderoon, where the Persian lady, affecting to regard the Jew as a dog rather than a human being, does not even take the trouble to veil herself in his presence, and that scandals may well arise from such a state of things. His Majesty’s Minister, as stated above, has made joint representa tions with his French colleague on this subject to the Persian Government. Bu shire. Smuggling in all the small ports of Fars continues to flourish and increase, and the peisons engaged in the enterprise have now begun to dispose of their contraband ware in the suburbs of Bushire itself. The foui Customs launches ordered by the Persian Government from India have now arrived.0 3 [ 1072 ] Mohammerah. The Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiari Khans are disputing with regard to the Governorship of Behbehan. The latter have collected a force at Malamir threatening both the Karan and Behbehan districts. General News. The Press. Two new papers have been started at Tehran in connection with the reform move ment. One called the “ Medjliss ” gives a report of the proceedings of the Tehran National Assembly, and sometimes publishes articles and letters. The other paper, called the “Tamaddun,” is edited by a gentleman who was exiled by the Ain-ed- Dowleh to Kelat-i-Naderi on a political charge. It is National in its tone. Two new papers have appeared at Ispahan which are distinctly anti-foreign, and Tabreez now also has started a newspaper. The Bushire paper, “ Muzaffer,' , was suppressed for a time, but has now been allowed to reappear. The “ Habl-ul-Matin,” published at Calcutta, is largely read at Tehran. It is ultra- National, and occasionally anti-foreign, but always anti-British. The latest number which has reached Tehran publishes an article containing the most exaggerated eulogy on all concerned in the reform movement. It describes the promoters of the National Bank as the saviours of Persia, and talks as if, by a stroke of a pen, Persia had now been restored to all her ancient glories. Exodus of Non-Moslems. From Shiraz and Bushire we hear of the exodus of Jews to Jerusalem ; from the Urmia district reports reach us of numbers of Chaldeans emigrating to Canada. The “ Jadeeds,” or supposed Jewish converts to Islam, are reported to be leaving Meshed in large numbers. The only non-Mussulman people who, besides the Armenians, have so far shown no inclination to leave the country in consecpience of the growing insecurity of life and property are the Parsees. One of their principal members has, however, been lately murdered at Yezd, as reported above, and if such incidents are repeated it may influence them as well. Tehran, February 28, 1907. No. 22. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received April 15.) (Extract.) Tehran, March 25, 1907. WITH reference to my despatch of the 24th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit a translation of a note from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, in which he assures me that the resignation of M. Naus will not change the Customs Administration, which will retain its present character and not be farmed out. As you will recollect, both M. Naus and M. Priem, his first assistant, were dis missed at the same time. Since then, representations have been made to the Persian Government to retain the services of M. Priem. It has beep found impossible, however, to induce the Assembly to withdraw its objections to M. Priem’s retaining the Director ship of the Customs, which had been confided to M. Mornard, who has been employed in Azerbaijan. M. Priem has, however, been promised the post of financial adviser to the Persian Government. M. Naus, who is shortly leaving for Europe, expresses his intention of returning in a year, when it is presumed circumstances will have changed considerably. _ . . . I am given to understand by the Finance Minister that the administration of the Customs will remain in the hands of a Belgian chief, under the nominal control of a Persian Director. This Director will act on the advice of a Committee of Control, composed of Danes or Swedes, who will have access to all the books, &amp;c., of the Belgian Administration.22 Inclosure in No. .22. , . . . ■ r ' r” t - -r 4 T *' ,1 , Grand Vizier to Sir C.

It is obvious that the Persian Government will, in view of its duty, take suitable measures lor the proper administration of the Customs. . No. 23. Sir C.

Inclosure in No. 23. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. Northern Persia. Tehran. THE Zil-es-Sultan was dismissed from the Governorship of Ispahan on the 16th instant, and Nizam-es-Sultaneh was appointed to replace him. The people who had taken refuge at His Majesty’s Consulate-General in Ispahan, however, refused to leave before the fact of his Highness’ dismissal was notified to them by the Tehran Assembly. The Zil-es-Sultan proposes to travel in Europe in a few weeks’ time. The Sadr Azam was dismissed on the 17th instant. The Kashis were too strong for him, and made the Shah believe that all his present troubles were due to the Prime Minister’s weakness, if not actually to his leaning to the National cause. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh left the following day for his country house, and proposes to go to Europe shortly. His eldest son, Mushir-ul-Mulk, is no longer Minister at St. Peters- burgh, and will accompany his father in honourable exile. The younger son, Motamin-ul-Mulk, will remain at Tehran. The new Ministry is composed of eight members, including three new ones. The Farman Farma, Yezir Homayun, and Mukhber-es-Suitaneh ; the latter is a brother of President of the Assembly, and accompanied the Amin-es-Sultan round the world. The new Cabinet presented themselves to the Assembly on the 21st instant, when Yezir Afkham, The Minister of the Interior, read the Shah’s Rescript, placing the whole administration of government under eight responsible Ministers, as follows :—. . Ministry of Justice .. .. Farman Farma. n - Foreign Affairs ,. Ala-es-Sultaneh. - ,, Interior.. .. Yezir Afkham. Finance .. Naser-ul-Mulk. ,, War .. .. Naib-es-Sultaneh.. ,, Education . . Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. „ Public Works . . Mohandis-ul-Mamalek. ,, Commerce .. Yezir Homayun. The Shah has again telegraphed to the Amin-es-Sultan, who is still in Switzerland, to come to Tehran. He will probably be at first appointed Minister of the Interior’ and then take his place at the head of affairs as before., M. Priem has been given the title of “ Conseiller des Finances/’ .Th§ postal Administration has been given to Moavin-ed-Dowleh now that Yezir Homayun has been appointed Minister of Commerce. Yezir Makhsus, Governor of Tehran, has been appointed Minister of the Court in the place of Ala-ed-Dowleh. A remarkable document was submitted to the Assembly by the Minister of Finance at one of the sittings. It purports to be an account up to date of the Government expenditure. The total—which, however, does not agree with the detailed account—-shows a balance of 3,232,593 tomans outstanding. The following are some of the details :— Princes, servants of harems, ennuchs, &amp;c. Omera, Kajar Khans, and other Khans Omena and Ministers Scribes, Moonshis, &amp;c. Foreign Office, Diplomatic Corps, &amp;c. European and Persian doctors Colleges, &amp;c. The total, according to the details given, comes to 3,481,366 tomans, which purports to be the total outstanding deficit up to last “ Norouz,” i.e., the 22nd March, 1907. The Assembly, on the 16th March, passed the following Bill with the object of settling the above account:— “ The National Assembly approves that all the debt of the Government on account of the yearly statement up to the end of ‘ Yunt-il ’ (1906-7) shall be settled and closed by his‘Excellency the Minister of Finance by the sum of 2,000,000 tomans borrowed from the National Bank .... on condition that in all cases of Government indebted ness due observance should be made of the importance or necessity of the expendituie and the riedits of those having claims, in such a manner that immediate and pressing expenditure and the rights of those having claims should all be settled, and the shortage should be a reduction in accordance with equity and justice from the claims of those persons ; and a statement of the manner in which the sum is divided should be submitted to the Assembly.” News was received in Tehran on the 26th instant of the murder of an Armenian Russian subject at Sabzevar, in Khorassan, by a fanatical mob, on the ground that he had had unlawful relations with a Mussulman woman. It is reported that the woman was also seized and murdered, and that the bodies of the two were subsequently burned publicly. This is an unfortunate incident at the present juncture. Tomans. 315,405 116.725 77,446 67,767 422,996 54.472' 49,380 Tabreez. Mr. Wratislaw reports the murder of a German subject at Soujboulak by a ^ ' 'The Customs and Postal employes went on strike about the middle of March, and for some time no business could be transacted at eithei Department. ^ In commenting on the demonstrations of February last, Mr. Wratislaw says that the bazaars were reopened on the receipt of a telegram of the Azerbaijan Deputies at Tehran to the effect that, “ Thanks to God and the patriots of the country, particularly the hio’h-minded inhabitants of Tabreez, a Decree has been issued which confirms and perfects the principles of the Constitution.” The population did not show any particular alacrity in opening their shops, and their leaders found themselves under the painful necessity of deceiving the public regarding a foreign guarantee ot the Shah’s fresh promises, and the name of His Majesty’s Government was in some instances taken in vain in this connection. It became subsequently known, however, that the Shah’s undertaking to establish a fully constitutional Government was unsupported bv any foreign indorsement. Next to the admirable way m which older was preserved throughout, the most striking point in the movement was the distrust ot the Shah universally manifested. Meshed. The leading men of Meshed have agreed to resist the expected extortions of the new Governor-General. In case of any member being wronged, every one will take sanctuary. There is, generally speaking, a feeling of liberty in the air. [1072] C 4A local Assembly was formed on the 87th February, not without some dis- '(j'Ll H C 0 S Thirty-five Tabreezi Turks, now in Meshed, have hound themselves by oath to devote their lives and property, at all risks and costs, to the obtaining of political liberty for Persia. . „ „ the local Assembly, which subsequently turned into a town Council, is by no means free from internal disaffection. The clerical and mercantile elements in it have shown much animosity. On the 11th IVfarch an excited scene occuned. The clericals tried to silence the merchants. The latter replied that there were many things the priests knew nothing about. A mollah responded hotly that there was nothing the religious leaders of the people were not fully competent to deal with. Whereupon a number of the merchants left the Council room. All the officials and dependents of the Shrine, with the exception of one member who is the leading Meshed reformer, have sent a Memorial to the Shah representing that the Mujteheds, mollahs, and Seyeds of the Shrine, who are the rightful descendants and successors of the great Iman, are not disposed to submit to any National Assembly or any other authority other than that of the Shah himself. They are therefore entirely at his service in any movement he desires to undertake against the Constitutional party. This may alter the decision of the Shah to appoint Hajji Sheikh-ur-Reis, one of the leading spirits in the reform movement at Tehran, as chief guardian of the Shrine. It is not unlikely that the Memorial was got up for this purpose. “ The religious rulers of the people of Meshed,” writes Major Sykes, “ are reallv reactionary to the core. They have hitherto taken a part in the formation and deliberations of the local Assembly, not out of any sympathy for reform, but merely in order to try and control a popular movement which they could not check, and which they feared would otherwise develop independently of them, and perhaps end in the destruction of their power. This power of the priesthood over the minds of all classes of Persians, constituting the great hindrance to progress, has its stronghold in Meshed,” It may, however, be noted that no such power exists in Tehran. Central and Eastern Persia. Ispahan. The movement, which was directed by Agha Nejefi and Sheikh Norullah, and aimed at the dismissal of the Zil-es-Sultan, began on the 7th March, when a 'large crowd invaded the Persian telegraph office, and another excited mob took refuge at His Majesty’s Consulate-General. The Zihes-Sultan was dismissed on the 16th instant and a few days later the excitement at Ispahan subsided. In the interval Mr. Barnham had to deal with refugees to the extent of nearly 3,000 persons. With regard to the cause of the demonstration Mr. Barnham writes : “ Those responsible are in the first instance, no doubt Agha Norullah for the mollahs, then Haji Mohammed Hussein Kazerooni for the merchants. Haji Mohammed Hussein lias a large sum of money to receive from the Zil-es-Sultan, and apparently thinks he will have more chance of recovering it if His Highness is not Governor here. His chief clerk is the Adib-et-Tujjar, Member for Ispahan in the National Assembly, and now in active telegraphic communication with the people. Yezd. Writing on the subject of the murder of the Parsee merchant, Parviz ShaMehan the British Vice-Consul at Yezd on the 17th ultimo says: “On the 13th instant’ between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., Parviz Shahjehan, head of the Parsee firm of Shahjehan Brothers, was shot by some one at present unknown wdien returning from the bazaar and he died the next day.” His life had been threatened the previous November’ The murdered man had financed Mushir-ul-Mamalek, who was Vizier to the ex-Gm^nv Moayed-ed-Dowleh, now Governor-General of Ears. A few days before he was killed the murdered man had a stormy interview with Mushir-ul-Mamalek concerning their accounts. Theie are some other facts which tend to throw suspicion on Mushir-ul- Mamalek as the instigator of the murder, and on a young man named Ferrukh as the murderer. The British Vice-Consul writes: “ I doubt if the local authorities are doino- anything to find him (the murderer). °Seistan. The administration of the Deputy Governor, Mohammed Reza Khan, the eldest son of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, cannot be said to have begun well. A serious charge of rape has been brought against him by a man of Kain, whose daughter he enticed into his house. He has cruelly beaten another man brought before him on a frivolous accusation. Shiraz. A league, called the “ Anjumen-i-Islam” (Moslem community), has been formed composed of 500 of the clerical, mercantile, and other classes, and have taken oath to support the constitutional Assembly with their lives. A Seyid lately passing along a street shouted, “Long live freedom!” and punctuated his patriotic cry by sticking a knife into one of the pupils of a Jewish school passing near him. Kermanshah. There has been a good deal of local trouble owing to the disputes which arose respecting the elections, and some blood was shed during the riots. His Majesty’s Consul was referred to by the Governor and by the different parties in conflict, but endeavoured to keep out of all interference in the matter, which, he explained, was no concern whatever of his. ^ No. 21.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. Inclosure in No. 25. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. Northern Persia. Tehran. BURGLARIES and robberies have considerably increased during the last month. A Society was formed with the object of robbing the public systematically in the name of Islamic law. The National Assembly, upon whom the discredit was thrown, asked the Minister of the Interior to put a stop to this state of affairs and to suppress the ofiending “ Enjumen,” or Society. The Government thereupon took steps to suppress all Societies, of which quite a number had sprung into being, including one formed by the Princes. The Assembly again intervened, insisting on the suppression of only the offending Society, and eventually got their own way. With regard to the increasing insecurity in Tehran, the Government’s reply to the represen tations of the Assembly is that the police cannot be expected to do their duty whentlieir salaries are one year in arrear. which they naturally accept. The offenders, if caught, pay the police money, Tabreez. On the 13th instant a disturbance broke out owing to dissensions among the clergy, and the bazaars were closed for two days. The principal mollah endeavoured to eject a radical mollah from the town, but was eventually himself ejected. Partisans of both sides appeared armed in the streets, but fortunately no incident occmrec. Resht. Several antagonistic parties were formed during the course of the month in connection with the local Assembly, and much confusion was caused by demonstrations and counter-demonstrations by the rival factions. The leading Mujtehed left foi Tehran with a large following, while another party of his adherents left the town and camped outside. The disagreement apparently still continues, hut is not seiious, though an attempt was made to drag in the Russian and British Consulates. The movement in Resht has somewhat of a revolutionary tendency, and has consequently interfered with the silk and other trades. The peasants show an inclination to lefuse to continue paying their landlords’ rent. A number of them took retuge in a mosque with the object of evading their obligations. A strike occurred at Baku among the sailors of the Baku—Enzeli line, which paralyzed the service for a time. The mails were brought to Persia in steamers manned by Russian bluejackets, but travellers were not taken. The boatmen at Enzeli subsequently struck in sympathy. Ka shan. A movement has been started against the Jewish community, which includes one British subject. They have all taken refuge at the British telegraph office, and have sent telegrams to His Majesty’s Minister praying for protection, and representations are being made accordingly. Southern Persia. Shiraz. The local Assembly continues to oppose the provincial authorities, and on the 23rd March the Kavam’s son, Salar-es-Sultan, wrote to Mr. Grahame that they could no longer restrain the populace, whose feelings were being worked upon by letters from the,women of Tabreez reproaching them for inaction. On the 24th March an attack was made on the Jewish quarter. This incident is likely to increase the emigration of Persian Jews, more than seventy families of whom have left Shiraz for Palestine within the last few months. Several small robberies are reported on the Shiraz-Ispahan road, hut the Bushire road appears to be fairly safe. Bushire. The new Governor of Bushire having been pressed by the Customs authorities to undertake the suppression of the Khans of Bunder Pig and Pudhilleh north of Bushire, through whose ports contraband is believed to pass into the country, he asked for troops to he sent from Shiraz. The Khans in consequence have sent lengthy telegrams of complaint to the Central Government at Tehran. The local Assembly is quiet, hut placards of an inflammatory character were being posted in the town and widely distributed at night during March, which somewhat disturbed the new Governor. A man, who subsequently proved innocent of the charge, yvas bastinadoed on suspicion of having distributed these placards. Western Persia. Kermanshah. Writing on the subject of the riots of last March, His Majesty’s Consul says :— “ Affairs in Kermanshah continued in much the same state of tension until the 14th March. The Governor had stated that a Commissioner would be sent. I hadbeen- informed by His Majesty’s Minister that no Commissioner would be sont, but it was stated by both sides with such certainty that I came to the conclusion that the authorities in Tehran must have changed their minds on the subject. On the 14th, tired of waiting, the whole of the trades and employment of the town, down to the porters, went into f bast ’ in the telegraph office, or pitched tents all round the roofs of the houses of the Maidan in which the telegraph office stands, even using the roofs of the palace where it abuts on the central square. The aristocratic party collected in the house of a mollah. On the 17th an order came from Tehran for the arrest of two leading members ot the aristocratic party, who were to be turned out of the town or sent to Tehran. The two men named got news of what was happening and. disappeared On the 18th a man belonging to the people’s party left his house to go to the square, He had to pass the house where the aristocrats were staying, where he was received with hoots and, it is said, stones. He rushed to the Maidan shouting that he was being killed. The people in the Maidan turned out with sticks, and rushed to the mollah’s house, where they were met with shots. The aristocratic party thought they were being attacked, and the two missing men were probably to be found in their house. Firing continued all the morning, but the shooting must have been extremely inaccurate, for only one man was killed intentionally. A small boy was killed by a stray bullet, and two men are reported to have died of their wounds.” April 23, 1907. Reports have reached His Majesty’s Minister of disturbances at Sultanabad caused by the intrigues of a leading mollah, whom both the Shah and the Assembly have endeavoured, so far in vain, to dislodge. The bazaars were closed for a time, and the feeling at Sultanabad is that the situation must indeed be grave if their oppressor cannot be brought to justice, the mollah in question being generally disliked and the events in the country during the last month. &lt; r • No progress seems to have been made in procuring ways and means for carrying on the Government. . . , ,, The Assembly is attacked on several sides. The whole Court is hostile, and the population of the town discontented because bread is as dear as^ ever. A dispute between the two leaders, which led to the resignation of both, has given an appearance of weakness, of which its enemies are taxing every advantage. A more important question has arisen in relation to an addition to the^ Constitution, guaranteeing equal treatment for all Persian subjects, irrespective of their creed. The mullahs protested. Of the three great Mujteheds, only one—Seyid Mohamed—declared in favour ot it. The others, supported by a large body of the clergy, maintain that Mussulman law must be enforced in a Mussulman country. The clerical world is divided on the suffiect. A large number of the priests, headed by Seyid Mohamed and the popular preacher Sheikh Jamal-ed-Din, declare openly that the law of Mahommed is a law of liberty and equality, and that those who say otherwise are traitors to their country and unworthy voll'mnr.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 10.) rac £ \ Gulahek, May 23, 1907. I HAVE the honour to inclose a Memorandum by Mr. Churchill on the subject ofthe new clauses of the Constitution until they have been submitted to the Mujteheds of Kerbela. What the result will be is doubtful. Sheikh Jamal has recently received irom Kerbela a formal message, which has been printed and widely distributed, charging t le Persian people “ to seek reform from the Shah through the Medjliss. The condition of the provinces is such as might be expected to result iiom the paralysis of the Central Government. In every town there is an independent Assembly, which acts without consulting the Governor or the Central Assembly at I ehran. One after another, unpopular Governors have been expelled, and the Central Government and the Tehran Assembly have found themselves powerless to resist. The danger of universal disorganization seems a real one. A spirit of resistance to oppiession and even to all authority is spreading throughout the country. The leaders are unknown. The inspiration seems to come from the north, perhaps Irom the Caucasus. The south is comparatively quiet, and is, on the whole, loyal. But a traveller on his way northwards observes that with every stage of his journey the language of the people becomes freer and their attitude to the Shah and his Government more hostile. Foreigners are liked or disliked as they are more or less connected with the existing Government. Ihe sentiment of independence in the widest sense, of nationality, ot the right to resist oppression and to manage their own affairs is rapidly growing among the people. It is strongest in Azerbaijan. It is very strong in the capital, and whatever befalls the existing Assembly, which may very possibly lose its present power and prestige, it is difficult to believe that the newly acquired sentiment of liberty and patriotism can altogether disappear. A feature of the present agitation is the growth of secret societies. There are bands of “ devotees ” in Baku and Northern Persia sworn to devote their lives to the good of their country and the destruction of its enemies. Tehran is full of societies, some of which hold public meetings ; others are bound by common rules, although the members are, in general, unknown to each other, It is said that, in certain events, joint action, in the form of violence or passive resistance, will immediately be taken on the orders of small Central Committees, Much of this may be talk, but the talk is earnest, Inclosure in No. 26. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. Northern Persia. Tehran. THE Atabeg-i-Azam arrived at Tehran the 26th April, and was formally appointed President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of the Interior on the 2nd May. He proceeded to the National Assembly on the 4th May, accompanied by his whole Cabinet, and made a statement of policy. The tone of the local press is getting more and more democratic, and new papers are constantly appearing. There are at present nearly thirty papers published in Tehran alone, including several dailies. Papers are also published in nearly all the provinces, and a Persian paper of a very anti-dynastic tone is published at Baku and widely circulated in Persia. Anonymous pamphlets are also widely spread in Tehran as before. A number of them are printed at Baku, and are remarkable for their inflammatory character. The Tehran pamphlets are chiefly directed against the Atabeg-i-Azam and the Government. The people having heard that M. Naus was about to leave the country, a hostile demonstration was organized against him by about forty persons who held Government bonds signed by M. Naus. The National Assembly took the matter up, and eventually agreed to M. Naus’ departure from Persia. M. Naus_ proposes to leave Tehran on the 25th instant. He has signed a deed, which His Majesty’s Minister has seen, appointing M. Priem his attorney in connection with the inquiry which is to be held, and pledging himself to render an account of his administration. He goes on leave for a year drawing his full salary. r l he Par sees have made urgent representations respecting the proposals of the Mujteheds, in connection with the amplification of the Constitution, pressing for equality before the law of all persons irrespective of religion. They have not associated themselves in this matter with the Armenians and Jews, who are kept in the background. The Parsees have received satisfactory assurances from the chief leaders, and from the Mujtehed Seyed Mohamed. Great agitation is, however, going on among the clergy in connection with this proposal. The Shah has appealed to Kerbela in the hope of breaking uo the Assembly. The Atabeg-i-Azam is still popular with the Assembly, but is getting tired, and talks of retiring. The revenues are coming in very slowly. Tabrcez. During the whole month under review the situation at Tabreez itself has become more and more critical. On the 6th the Governor, Nizam-ul-Mulk (formerly Minister of Justice), finding his position untenable, decided to leave the city. He was, however, induced to return on the 10th. Having expelled one of the principal Mujteheds, the populace closed the bazaars on the 13th instant, and the local Assembly went to the telegraph office and informed the Tehran National Assembly that the country was tired of waiting for a .constitutional Government, and that the bazaars would remain closed until the Fundamental Law was promulgated. No satisfactory reply having been received from Tehran, they threatened that, unless the Fundamental Law were promulgated within ten days, that a special law would be made locally for Azerbaijan. On the 15th Mr. Wratislaw telegraphed that demonstrations continued, and that he feared exasperation was increasing, and that some extreme step might be taken, such as a declaration of independence on the part of Azerbaijan. The Shah was supposed to intercept the telegrams they sent to the Tehran Assembly and to reply to them himself. The following day the situation grew more critical, and armed demonstrators paraded the streets clamouring to be led to Tehran, 't he local Assembly applied to Mr. Wratislaw to act as intermediary, and certain unofficial steps were taken by His Majesty’s Minister, with the cognizance of the Russian Legation. The situa tion then temporarily improved until the 22nd instant, when the local Assembly heard that a large force of irregulars was marching on the town, and had reached within about 30 miles. They wished to know whether this force was acting under the Shah’s orders before taking any measures against it. His Majesty’s Minister again addressed the Premier unofficially, and received the information that the report was entirely unfounded, which he duly transmitted to Mr. Wratislaw. Resht. The Governor of the Province of Ghilan travelled to Tehran with the Atabeg-i- Azam at the end of April, and arrived in Tehran just in time to be present at the death-bed of his aged father, Saad-ed-Dowleh. His experience during the short time he was Governor of the province was apparently so disagreeable that he showed no desire to return. This is instructive, as he made most of his large fortune in Ghilan, when he was previously there as Governor-General. The Assembly and local Councils have apparently put a stop to his peculations. The province has been without a Governor during the greater part of the month, and seems to get on quite as well without one. On the 4th the telegraph office was closed by the demonstrators, and neither the Russian nor British Consular officers could for some time telegraph to their Legations. On the 5th instant the Russian Consul at Resht started a collection, to which he himself subscribed 20/. out of Government funds, for the purpose of assisting those persons who had been thrown out of work by the closing of the bazaars by the demonstrators. The clergy, on hearing of the Russian Consul’s action, preached against it, saying that Persians should never accept alms from Russians. The people of Resht received telegrams of encouragement from Tabreez. A corps of volunteers was raised, which paraded the streets. On the 7th the British Vice-Consul was informed that some people had decided to enter the Vice-Consulate by force to sack it and to kill its occupants, in order to force the hands of the British Government to assist the supporters of the constitutional movement. The Russian Consul, on hearing the report, invited Mr. Hyacmtn Rabmo to take up his quarters at the Russian Consulate. The British, Russian, and French Consular officers, who found that they were cut off from telegraphic communication with their Legations, protested to the local authorities, and the telegraph office was reopened. _ The arms and ammunition for the Government which were landed at Enzeli were stopped at the instance of the local Assembly.By the 13th instant the condition of the town was again normal, and no further disturbances were expected. The new Governor of Resht is Vezir Akrem. Kerman. The local Assembly meets periodically, but in the absence of any regulations does not know what to do, and therefore does nothing, the people do not understand or show any interest in it. Southern Persia. Shiraz. On the 4th instant, in consequence of the growing discontent of the populace,. who saw in the Kavam-ul-Mulk a firm supporter of the autocratic system, the long- threatened popular movement broke out. The shops were closed and demonstrations were set on foot in Tehran in sympathy. On the other hand, the Kavam-ul-Mulk a party took simultaneous action, with the result that the whole province became disturbed. The hioh roads became immediately unsafe, and several caravans were robbed, including British'merchandize to the value of about 1,800?. The British courier was robbed of. his post-baa's between Bushire and Shiraz, lo exonerate himself horn blame, the, Kavam-ul-Mulk thereupon telegraphed to the National Assembly at Tehran and to the Shah that all this disturbance had been brought about by the British. In reply to uro-ent representations on the subject of the robbery of British merchandize and the loss of 'our despatches, the Persian Foreign Office writes : “ The necessary orders have been given in this matter to the proper authorities.” In the meantime it is announced that the Nizam-es-Sultaneb will proceed to Shiraz from Ispahan to take up the Governorship. ‘ ; • rr Bunder Abbas. At the beginning of May about 200 persons took refuge at His Majesty’s Consulate with 'the object of obtaining the redress of their grievances, which were connected with the administration of the district. His Majesty’s Consul was instructed not to interfere in the matter, and the refugees left the Consulate within three or four days. ——.■■■--■n,,-- -T-i- m. ■■■■ No. 27. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 8&lt;) Gulaheh, June 18, 1907. I HAVE the honour to report an incident which has led to a voluminous corre spondence with the Persian Government, with which I do not propose to trouble you. For some time past there have been disorders in Kermanshah, arising out of a contest between two parties—the popular and the aristocratic—which, since the establish ment of popular institutions in Persia, have been struggling for mastery. The Governor, who is a brother of the Ain-ed-Dowleh, the late reactionary Grand Vizier, sympathizes with the aristocratic party, which had till lately the upper hand, and is no doubt supported by the Court. The leaders of this party, whose expulsion bad been reluctantly permitted by the Governor in deference to the popular outcry, were recently allowed to return. Disorders broke out in an aggravated form, which finally culminated in a general fusillade. There was some loss of life. Care v^as, however, taken not to fire on the premises occupied by the Imperial Bank, though they were adjacent to the house of one of the popular leaders, which had been converted into a sort of fortress. It is probable that the popular leaders had relations with the Salar-ed-Dowleh, whose opposition to the Government made him popular. However that may be, when the Government forces, consisting mainly of members of the nomad tribes in the neighbour-' hood, v r ere brought into the town, an assault committed by the mob on an aristocratic leader afforded a convenient pretext for retaliation, and the Governor, or the Commanding Officer, ordered, or allowed, a general attack by the Royal forces on the bazaars, which were completely looted. The popular party, finding itself outmatched and plundered—as they believed, at the Governor’s instigation-—announced their31 'ttar tions itaud ilace, kg. -tions, 'ulk’s rbed. iding ed of , the ) the dyto iloss been meed the st/fi. were eted 3 or \ 1 , orre* 311. of a blish- jrnor,. diizes doubt ,antly red to in a ire on use of » whose m the ibour- icratie r the in the rtched theh' intention of taking “ bast^ in the British Consulate. The Governor himself was absent. The doctor, who was tending the Consul’s wife, then suffering from the effects of a severe accident, urged the applicants to leave the Consulate alone. His warnings were disregarded. The mob entered the Consular premises by the garden, which was not defended by a wall, and a crowd of 2,000 persons were soon in occupation of the Consulate. The other party protested, and sent me a telegram full of denunciations of the refugees and of their leader, a popular priest, Mollah Mohammed Mehdi. The refugees, on their part, urged that the telegraph-office was in the hands of their enemies, and that their appeals to the Tehran Government and Assembly were suppressed. I communicated with the Government, pointing out the intolerable position in which the Consulate had been placed owing to its forcible occupation by a party faction for political purposes, and adding that I should have to lay all the circumstances before my Government and ask for instructions in view of the present application of the Persian doctrine of “ bast,” which, as I pointed out, was wholly without warrant in international law. By way of reply I received a visit from the member of the Foreign Office charged with British affairs, who, speaking by order of the Shah, demanded the surrender of the leaders of the popular party, and especially the Mollah Mehdi. I told him that he could not wish their expulsion more ardently that I did, but that he must be aware that Persian usage would not justify the surrender of persons who had taken “ bast,” and that even if I instructed the Consul to surrender the leaders, he could not compel a crowd of 2,000 persons to consent to their removal. If the Persian Government could induce them to depart, I was willing to do all 1 could to facilitate that arrangement; beyond that I was, as he well knew, powerless. The next day I received a second visit, and an even more pressing demand. I wrote a note in his presence ti the Minister for Foreign Affairs, putting in as clear and forcible language as 1 could the facts of the case, and urging the Persian Government, as responsible for the security of Consular Bepresentatives resident in this country, to take such steps as would insure the speedy evacuation of the Consulate. I may here observe that the Shah’s demand, if it had been complied with, would have resulted, in all probability, in a bloody encounter in the Consulate ; it would have seriously compromised the honour and reputation of this Legation; and it is quite inconceivable that His Majesty the Shah should not have been aware of the fact. In the meantime Captain Haworth had opened a letter addressed to the Consulate Munshi, and found it to contain a communication from the Salar to Mollah Mehdi, calling on him to assist the Prince in freeing the people from their oppressors, and denouncing him as a traitor and an infidel if he refused compliance. This letter, which certainly did not prove Mehdi’s guilt, as similar letters had been sent all over the country, was at once communicated by Captain Haworth to the Governor. At this juncture the Assembly interfered, and, as a result of a private under standing between its President and the Atabeg, telegrams were sent to the refugees promising that a fair and impartial inquiry would be held at Hamadam, where a Commission would examine the conduct of the leaders on both sides. At the same time a safe conduct was offered on behalf of the Government to all persons concerned. These telegrams were dispatched to the Governor, and copies were given me to transmit to the refugees. They were signed by the Atabeg and the President of the Assembly. I accepted this arrangement as satisfactory, and instructed Captain Haworth to recommend the refugees to act in compliance with the terms offered. Captain Haworth thought that the terms would prove acceptable. I learned, however, shortly afterwards that fire had been opened on the refugees in the Consulate by the mob outside. The Governor had refused either satisfaction or explanation. I at once addressed a strongly worded message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and requested Mr. Churchill to see his Excellency as well as the Atabeg, and to rejmesent the gravity of the occurrence. Mr. Churchill saw both statesmen. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at first was inclined to lay the blame on this Legation for having refused to surrender the ringleaders. But he was soon convinced of the impossibility of such a step. The Atabeg at once realized the nature of the offence, and sent a strongly worded telegram to the Governor demanding an explanation, and making him personally responsible for the safety of the Consulate. I received the same day a telegraphic message from the Minister for foreign Affairs of a satisfactory character, copy of which I have the honour to inclose herewith. The anti-popular party have sent telegrams to Tehran (one of which, addressed to the Russian Legation, M. de Hartwig has kindly communicated to me) stating that theConsulate has been made by Mollah Mehdi and his friends a base of operations against their enemies ; that his presence there is a cause of danger and inconvenience to the town; and that I must be induced to surrender him. On the other hand, the lefugees state that their property has been looted with the consent of the Governor; that their lives are in danger; and that they cannot leave the Consulate unless they have some security for their lives and property. It is quite impossible for me to form a judgment as to the relative guilt of the two parties, both of whom have probably done as much mischief as lay in their power to do. It is evident, however, th^it we have no right to surrender the refugees unless their guilt is proved ; and even if we had the right, we have no power to enforce compliance. I have therefore informed Captain Haworth that he is not to run any personal risk, and that I leave it to his discretion to take up his residence at the Imperial Bank should it be necessary to do so; that he must impress on the Governor that he is not taking sides, and is most anxious to be rid of the refugees, but that he cannot surrender them unless their gudt is proved ; and that he must do all in his power to facilitate a peaceful settlement. The Persian Government has informed me unofficially that the Governor of Hamadan, a man of high character, and much respected in the neighbourhood, is under orders to proceed to Kermanshah ; and I trust that on his arrival a settlement will be arrived at. The refugees have already expressed their satisfaction at the prospect of his arrival. With regard to the Governor of Kermanshah, his immediate removal, under present circumstances, might only increase the disorders. But I learn from Captain Haworth that he has not made any formal apology for the outrage on the Consulate, and it will no doubt become necessary to demand his removal. I have received the usual evasive answers from the Persian Government, and the Russian Minister informs me that before his removal the Russian Legation will have to press for a settlement of their outstanding claims. Before taking decisive action I propose to await further information. I may observe that the Atabeg, who is a personal enemy of the Governor and of all his family, will do all in his power to secure his removal. In any case, he will be practically superseded on the arrival of the Zahir-ed-Dowleb, from Hamadan, which is expected on the 21st. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. In closure in No. 27. Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir C. Spring-Rice&gt; (Telegraphic.) _ t June 16, 1907. I HAVE this minute received your telegram informing me of the extraordinary conduct of the mob at Kermanshah. I have reported the mutter to his Highness the Atabeg-LAzam. He joins me in expressing the regrets of the Imperial Government at this unfortunate incident. I hasten to inform your Excellency that peremptory orders are being sent by telegraph to the Governor of Kermanshah to seize and punish the individuals who have dared to fire on the British Consulate. No. 28. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey. —(Received July 8.) bn, Gulahck June 18 1907 I HA\ E had the honour to transmit to you, in a separate despatch, Mr. ChurchilBs monthly summary of Persian affairs in Tehran and the provinces. I he process of disintegration continues in a somewhat less peaceful form than hitherto. An armed insurrection has taken place in the west; the nomads are pi aging, the Province of Azerbaijan was thrown into an intense state of excitement by the discovery of a^Royal plot against the Members of the local Assembly ; a conflict has taken place in Kermanshah between the popular and the aristocratic factions, the latter having gamed the upper hand owing to the appearance in the town of the Royal troops. J[ 1072 ] I) ihe financial condition of the Government is, if possible, worse than ever. The police of the capital are on strike; it has been found almost impossible to scrape together money enough to induce the Tehran troops to leave for the scene of the rebellion. The Teh ran Assembly has little influence in the provinces. It vainly thundered for some weeks against the Kavam-ul-Mulk in Shiraz and a brigand priest in Suitanabad. In both these cases the covert protection of the Government has been able to defeat the efforts of the Assembly. It has dispatched a Circular telegram to the provinces, urging them to refer all matters for settlement to Tehran, but so far without much effect. It is, however, regarded with respect by the Shah and the Government, who have been forced on several occasions to yield to its pressure. It has passed a financial law which, it is hoped, will bring about a gradual reform of provincial finances. Whether or not it satisfies the popular aspirations, it is at any rate regarded as indispensable, and neither the Shah nor his Government has the courage to openly attack it. A more ingenious and successful form of attack has been directed against the Assembly in the form of an amendment to the Constitution giving all Persians equal rights, irrespective of their creed. The mollahs intervened, in the name of the Shara Law, and the consequence has been a breach between the popular party and the priests, their nominal leaders. The Government would, if it dared, borrow abroad to meet its present liabilities. But, in view of the popular sentiment, it does not resort to a foreign loan. It appeals to the Assembly for help, in the form of subscriptions to the proposed National Bank. The answer it receives is that the people will subscribe as soon as the rich nobles, who are known to have large sums of money, show the way. This the rich refuse to do. As to raising money by taxation, the Assembly appears to be convinced that as soon as the Government has any money in hand it will use it for the destruction of the Medjliss, Any effective control of expenditure is regarded as quite out of the question. The exasperation against the Shah is rapidly increasing. It is universally believed that he is determined, if he can, to withdraw the Constitution, even at the cost of the independence of the country. The Atabeg is at his wits’ end, and is in a state of profound depression. It is believed that the Shah is deeply disappointed at his refusal to take action against the Medjliss, or to obtain a foreign loan. Without money the Prime Minister is powerless, and it is hard to see from what source money can be drawn. It cannot be said, however, that the people at large share his depression. The country on the whole is not much more disturbed than in more normal years. There has not been much loss of life in the various civic disorders, and the people have in most cases gained their ends by the expulsion of oppressive Governors and relief from local tyranny and extortion. They are consequently not dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, although from the Government point of view there is no money in the State coffers, no control over the provinces, and an almost complete state of anarchy throughout the country. There is a considerable difference between the north and south. In the south the popular movement has an almost farcical character; it turns on personal or pecuniary questions. In the north there appears to be a more or less definite political aim and a keen sense of patriotism. So far there is no sign of an anti-foreign outbreak ; but there has also been no definite sign ot foreign interference. If there is, the popular leaders are said to be prepared with their programme.

I HAVE the honour to inclose herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for June. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RIQE.Inclosure in No. 29. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. Northern Persia, Tehran. National Assembly.—The discussions which were m progress during the last week of Mav, concerning equality before the law, irrespective of creed lor which a supplementary clause was to he added to the Constitution, were suddenly Droug o ' an end on the 25th May, when the contending parties joined hands against the Government on an entirely different issue. News from Tabreez, where the bazaars had been closed for some time, reached the Assembly to the effect that the ohah had employed agents to coerce the Tabreez local Assembly ; that an irregular foice was marching on the town, and that certain persons had been paid by the Shahs agents to murder some Members of the “ Enjumen. Buyuk Khan, the son of Bahim Khan, a robber Chief of the district of Karadagh in Azerbaijan, then residing in Tehran, was accused of having telegraphed to his son that the Shah approved his action. This greatly exasperated the people both at Tabreez and in Tehran, who demanded Bahim Khan’s instant arrest, which, after some show of opposition, lasting over the 25th and 26th May, was finally agreed to on the 27th. r lhe bazaars of Tehran were closed on the 25th and 26th, when several thousand excited people collected at the Assembly, which sat on the 25th until 11 'SO p.m. The illuminations in celebration of the Shah’s birthday, which were to have taken place on the night of the 26th, were prohibited by the populace, and even the Imperial Bank was not allowed to illuminate. A remarkable feature of the demonstration at Tehran was the revolutionary and anti-dynastic tone of the speeches delivered in the grounds of the National Assembly. Another feature of the movement is the sympathy shown by the employes of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice. The former are said to have declared that, if the people’s just demands were not conceded, they would all go on strike in a body. It should be remembered that the Foreign Office officials have not received any pay for over eighteen months. A faction, headed by some prominent mollahs, including the Mujtehed Sheikh Fazlullah and the head of the Seyeds, Nakib-us-Sadat, has shown considerable activity during the month, hostile to the National Assembly. The latter sent his son to the Russian and British Legations to say that a deputation of 2,000 persons wished to invade their grounds as a protest against the recent action taken by the Assembly in suppressing fiefs, as reported elsewhere. They received the utmost discouragement, and have apparently abandoned this form of intrigue, for the present at any rate. M. Naus left Tehran on the 30th May, but was stopped at Enzeli by the people, who telegraphed to the National Assembly to ask whether he was leaving the country with their sanction. He was eventually allowed to embark. The want of money is being felt very keenly—at any rate a great show is being made by the Government of penury which the Atabeg-i-Azam lays stress on at every opportunity. A feeble attempt was lately made to revive the National Bank scheme, and it was suggested by the Atabeg-i-Azam that the Imperial Bank should make the National Bank a commercial advance of 200,000/. M. Babino pointed out that the bank was pressing the Persian Government for the repayment of an advance of the same amount, and that the National Bank did not even exist. In the meantime the soldiers are pressing for pay, and the Tehran police have made demonstrations for the purpose of receiving a year’s arrears of pay. Several new papers have lately appeared, and their tone is even more democratic and anti-dynastic than ever. _A man named Raghib Effendi was shot at Tehran on the 15th instant in broad daylight. Tabreez. The bazaars were closed during the last half of May and the town was practically in a state of siege. At night the streets were patrolled by bodies of armed men in the service of the local Assembly. Similar patrols held all the entrances of the town, and challenged, and even searched, all persons leaving or entering the place. On the 21st May tin ee men entered the telegraph office with the intention of assassinating certain members of the local Assembly, which held its sittings there. Their proceedingsattracted suspicion and they were arrested. One of them resisted, and was shot and mortally wounded. The two uninjured men were well beaten, and confessed that they were natives of Karadagh who had been promised 100 tomans each and a rifle to murder the leading members of the Assembly by Ikram-es-Sultan, one of the Shah’s attendants. The wounded man voluntarily confirmed the statement of his accomplices before expiring. On the 22nd it became known that Buyuk Khan, son of Rahim Khan, was advancing towards Tabreez with a considerable force, pillaging all the villages on his way. Two days later the apprehensions caused by this news were somewhat allayed by a telegram to the effect that a local tribe was pillaging Rahim Khan’s territory in the absence of his son, who was obliged to return in order to defend his father’s estates. On the 25th a letter from Buyuk Khan to the Governor of Tabreez was intercepted, stating that he had pillaged a satisfactory number of villages and was ready to come to Tabreez, if the Governor gave the word, and carry off the local Assembly to Tehran. Mr. Wratislaw in reporting the above, commented that these events increased the general hatred and distrust of the Shah, if that were possible. The Governor was at once placed under arrest when the incriminating letter was received. The matter was taken up by the Tehran Assembly on the 25th and 26th May, with the result that Rahim Khan was placed under arrest, as reported in another paragraph. The situation became somewhat calmer until the 5th June, when the disturbances were renewed on account of the scarcity of bread. The local Assembly, which continued to sit at the telegraph office, was mobbed by a crowd demanding wheat, and during the course of the day one of the richest merchants of the town, who was supposed to have cornered w'heat, was beaten to death by the mob and hung outside the telegraph office. There was considerable excite ment for a time, and the owners of wheat contemplated taking refuge at His Majesty’s Consulate-General. Mr. Stevens, who had taken charge from Mr. Wratislaw, who had gone on leave of absence to England, dissuaded the people from again taking refuge at the Consulate. Disturbances were reported at the end of May from Maku, a town and district at the extreme north-west corner of Azerbaijan, where the populace expelled their Chieftain. An attempt is being made to arrest Buyuk Khan, but he is still at large. Hesht. The Foreign Office Agent left on the 25th May, and the new Governor not having arrived, the administration of the province seems to have been left to look after itself. The result was that comparative calm was restored, though there seemed to be an increase of activity on the part of the extreme popular party. When the news of the Tabreez events reached the local Assembly on the 2nd instant, a demonstration was organized in sympathy, and the bazaars were closed. Telegrams were sent to labreez and Tehran, and several messages were sent through His Majesty’s Legation to the Tehran Assembly. AVhen it was discovered at Besht that the matter had been more or less settled to the satisfaction of the populace, the bazaars were reopened. Disturbances are reported at Talish, a district on the Caspian shoie between Enzeli and Astara. . The local Assembly at Enzeli was torn by internal dissension, and a disturbance took place on the 7th May. Central and Eastern Persia. Ispahan. His Highness Prince Nayer-ed-Dowleh is designated as the Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s successor as Governor. rru The Tabreez popular leaders have telegraphed to the Mujteheds of Ispahan demanding their support in bringing pressure to bear on the bhah. Agha Nejefi advised the people not to pay taxes until the Shah signed the supplementary clauses to the Constitution, which gave rise to a stormy interview between him and the JNizam- es-Sultaneh. The supplementary clauses are, as a matter of fact, still under discussion in the Tehran Assembly. Agiia Nejefi subsequently delivered an address m the mosque against the use of European clothing, and declared that he and his colleagues would wear no clothing of European manufacture. The local Assembly wrote to the Governor asking for his help in preventing Persians from sending their children to t e mission school. ^ n 9 [1072] V ^The reports which have been received on the subject of the deposition of Semsam- es-Sultaneh from the post of Ilkhani, all tend to show tnat the change was brought about mainly at the instigation of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who is hostile to that branch of the Bakhtiari Khans. With the approaching departure of Nizam-es- Sultaneh from Ispahan for his new post at Shiraz, where he will have no connection with the tribe, comes the news of the reappointment ot Semsam-es-Sultaneh as Ilkhani. The change was made before the arrival at Tehran of Amin-es-Sultan, who probably used his influence in favour of Semsam-es-Sultaneh. At the end of May fighting occurred between the supporters of the two factions, and the men of Semsam-es- Sultaneh were out in every direction attacking caravans. Sultanabad. Haji Agha Mohsin, who has committed so many atrocities in the district is still at large, and the Tehran Assembly has been unable to bring about his arrest, Southern Persia. Shiraz. During the whole month under review the town of Shiraz has been in a disturbed condition owing to the hostility of different factions. The Kavam-ul-Mulk, who appeared to be the centre of disturbance, as usual, refused to leave the town in obedience to the urgent demand of the people, backed by the Tehran Assembly and the Shah’s orders. The result was demonstration and counter-demonstration, the taking of sanctuary at different mosques, and much talk. Fortunately the British Consulate was not dragged into the quarrel as on a former occasion. The Kavam-ul- Mulk is now reported to have left. The roads are in the usual condition of insecurity, and constant robberies of caravans and posts are reported. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL. Gulahek, June 18, 1907. Commercial Supplement to Monthly Summary. The commercial outlook in Persia is by no means encouraging. The political conditions are so uncertain that trade must be carried on with a margin of risk entirely disproportionate to the possible profits. At the present juncture, owing to political disturbances, the tightness of the money market, and the want of safety on the high roads, trade is carried on under the most unfavourable circumstances. The Customs Department, which was so severely attacked by the National Assembly, and seemed at one time likely to revert entirely into Persian hands, with the inevitable chaotic result, is, however, still under Belgian administration, and complaints have not increased of late.

I approve the action taken by you in the matter, as reported in your despatch. I am, Ac. (Signed) E. GREY.Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey,—{Received August 6.) Sir, Gu/ahek, July 10, 1907. I HAVE the honour to state that I was received by the Shah on the 6th instant. For certain reasons, which I venture to submit to you, sir, I thought it advisable to take advantage of the opportunity of this formal audience to make serious represen tations to His Majesty as to the situation in Persia. One of the principal Mujteheds has taken “ bast,” with a certain number of fol owers, in order to protest against the Constitution and the Assembly. His demands include the expulsion of the more prominent Members and the practical restoration of the old regime. He receives a heavy subsidy, about 100/. a-day, and this is universally believed to come from the Shah’s own Treasury'. The natural result is that public opinion is greatly exasperated, and that the Shah is daily becoming more unpopular. In addition to these facts, it is generally believed that the Shah is surrounded by courtiers of the old stamp, who are anxious to fill their pockets with the proceeds of the national revenue, or of a foreign loan, and who rightly regard the continued existence of the Assembly as an insurmountable obstacle to their designs. These persons enjoy the Shah’s entire confidence to the exclusion of his legitimate advisers. The A.tabeg, who has no great affection for popular institutions, but who is quite aware of the dangerous situation in which he himself is placed as the Shah’s nominally responsible adviser, sent me a message to the effect that he hoped I would speak to the Shah frankly ; such language, he said, could only do good. Accordingly, when I had presented the King’s letters to the Shah, I requested His Majesty to accord me the honour of a private audience. The Shah consented with apparent willingness, and all present withdrew, leaving His Majesty alone with myself and Abbas Ghuli Khan. I said that since His Majesty’s accession various unpleasant incidents had occurred, which I had been obliged to report to you : the Legation courier had been twice stopped and robbed, our Consulate had been forcibly occupied and fired into, our merchants had been pillaged, a Consulate gholam in uniform had been publicly beaten. I did not, however, propose to trouble His Majesty with these incidents, which were being dealt with by his Ministers. What 1 desired to bring to His Majesty’s notice was the general state of his Empire, of which these incidents were the outward sign. My Sovereign, as he knew, had the keenest interest in the Shah’s welfare and prosperity, and the interests of Great Britain were closely bound up with those of Persia. From this point of view it was my duty to represent to His Majesty the news which had reached me from various quarters, representing him as covertly working against those popular institutions which were largely due to his owm Imperial 'will. My Government had no concern whatever with the form, constitutional or other, of the Persian Monarchy so long as that Monarchy was strong and revered. But I thought the existence of these rumours, although I was sure they were false, was a serious danger to the stability of the throne and to the maintenance of its authority. His Majesty was aware how his father’s so-called friends had enriched themselves and had impoverished and ruined the Monarchy. The same influences were still around the throne. Their action was directed against the institutions to which the Shah had sworn allegiance. The whole odium of their proceedings fell upon their Sovereign, and the whole advantage would be reaped by those whose main object was the Sovereign’s destruction. It was said by some that foreign Governments were so deeply interested in the preservation of the Shah’s authority that if it were seriously imperilled they would intervene to save it. I warned him most seriously against counting on foreign aid in case he provoked a conflict. The British and Bussian Governments were both resolved not to intervene except in defence of their own interests and subjects. Should the Empire break up, the central authority be destroyed, and. foreign interests be imperilled, then no doubt intervention would take place. But it would then be too late, ai d even if intervention came in time, it would be fatal to his authority. Consequently, as he Could not fight the popular movement himself, and as he could not count on foreign aid, the only alternative was to come to an amicable agreement, to accept the inevitable to assist at the work of reform, and to wait until the gratitude of his people and their inherent love of the throne restored him to a power as great as, or greater, than that of his ancestors. In conclusion, I begged His Majesty to pardon my frankness, [ 1072 ] 0 3which was the expression of the serious interest which my Government felt in the Shah’s welfare, and was dictated hy my sense of the dangers which appeared to surround him. His Majesty listened with attention to my observations, and showed no signs of displeasure. Indeed, he expressed his thanks for my frankness, which he was sure was inspired by sincere friendliness. . With regard to the disorder which existed in the country, he said that it was merely the result of the sudden and violent change ol the system oi government. Besides, all countries were liable to internal disturbances. He had always maintained that a Constitution was the best thingf for a country, but not a Constitution such as Persia had at present. The Assembly consisted of a disorderly mob of ignorant persons, each pursuing his own selfish aims, and continually quarrelling in the hope of fishing in troubled waters. What was needed for the country was a moderate Constitution “ copied from one of the European States ” ; but the people demanded everything at once. There should be new elections and a new Chamber. I reminded His Majesty of the oath which he had sworn to observe the Con stitution, and not to dissolve the Chamber for two years. Those who advised him to break his oath exposed him, as they must know, to the incalculable risks of a formal excommunication as a “ betrayer of his word and a despiser of God.” What would Kerbela say to such an action ? The mere rumour of such an intention would do him immense harm. He replied that the air was full of false rumours spread by the enemies of the nation. As to Sheikh Fazlullah, the Shah was accused of having encouraged him. This was wholly false. The Sheikh had taken “ bast ” in consequence of his own restoring financial equilibrium. He could assure me that any foreign loan contracted in the future would be spent on the improvement of the country. The times, he said, w r ere difficult, and the work was a great one. I replied that a great work was fitted for a great Sovereign, and that at all times he could count on the most friendly sympathy of my Government. He again expressed his thanks, and it was noticeable that throughout the interview his manner was particularly gracious and amiable. I HAVE the honour to report as follows on the financial situation No progress has been made with regard to the navnient of th* snma rlnc* +U .1 With regard to finance, he was quite aware of the way in which his father’s courtiers had disposed of the previous loans. He would see that this should not happen again. In conjunction with his Minister of Finance he was labouring at a scheme for quarrels with his fellow priests. The Shah had nothing to do with it. He knew well enough that the Shah and his people could not be divided; they could not stand separately—each was necessary to the other. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. No. 32. Sir, Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 6.) ^ s Gulahek, July 12, 1907 r &amp; uu xu,ssm lo evaae payment of its liabilities to theHussian Bank, in account current, amounting, as the Russian Minister informs me, to about 420,000/. Meanwhile the troops, the diplomatic service, and the civil officials are still unpaid, and even the Cossack brigade is left two months in arrear. The Russian Bank advanced a sum sufficient to pay the brigade two months ago, but now insists that such advances should no longer he made on account current, but as a regular loan, formally sanctioned; and secured on the customs : and this the Ministers are afraid to agree to, as the Assembly would make them personally responsible were they privy to an increase of the foreign debt. I understand from the Russian Minister and M. Mornard that it is now proposed that the Customs Administration shall reserve part of the produce of the northern customs for payment of the brigade, as is done in the case of the Russian debt charge. Recently the police of the capital struck for their wages ; a settlement was arrived at, probably by private subscription. It is also a matter of hostile comment that in the middle of its financial difficulties the Government should have sanctioned the dispatch of costly missions to announce the accession of the Shah to foreign Courts. There is no money in the bazaars, and the continued pressure is making itself painfully felt. It is curious, however, to observe that the Administration, such as it is, continues ; the various departments continue their labours, though none of the officials are paid. The threats which sounded so alarming in the ears of the Atabeg, and which I reported last month, have not been fulfilled. There has been no general insurrection—merely a continuation, perhaps an accentuation, of the peaceful anarchy which has prevailed in Persia for the last six months, and which appears, from the archives of this Legation, to have been of constant occurrence as far hack at least as 1892. ... . . With regard to the vital question of financial reform, I have cross-questioned tim Finance Minister, who states that some progress has been made in the assessment of the land tax, and that a budget of expenditure is being prepared. The great difficulty at present is that there is no system of control, and that the Shah can draw money on his personal order without any specification of the object for which the money is required. The vested interests, especially as to the occupation of Government lands and the payment of unmerited pensions, are considerable ; and no one, least of all the Finance Minister, has the courage to face the discontent which would be caused even by the most elementary reform. The Finance Minister is quite aware that the present situation is impossible, and he assures me that if it continues much longer he will resign. , His present idea is that the Government should guarantee regular payment of the interest on the foreign debt in return for a pledge that repayment of the principal or sinking fund should not be required for three years. Should, however, the two Govern ments ask for a guarantee of a definite character, the Assembly would certainly refuse to pledo-e any of the national revenues, and the result would be a deadlock. I said that probably the two Governments would act in accordance with the usual practice in cases of bankruptcy, and would demand a pledge that the Persian Government should not in the meantime borrow elsewhere. . . Little progress has been made in regard to the proposal that has been pnvately made to the French Minister, that a French financier should be sent^ to report on the general financial situation and assume the direction of the proposed National Bank, as no official request has yet been made. It is, ot course, evident that the only hope of restoring financial equilibrium is to have an exhaustive inquiry into the actual state of affairs with a view to definite reforms, including a fixed Budget of revenue and expenditure and a consolidated loan. Bat to make such reforms effective force is necessary, and that can only be applied from without. The Persian Government and people do not yet realize the real state of affairs, and still appear to nourish illusions that they can evade their responsibilities and postpone a settlement. I venture to point out that from what I have learnt from M. Mornard, and from the Minister of Finance, no leal progress has been made with regard to the reforms, and that an advance of money would be at once squandered without any lasting benefit to the country. Until effective control is instituted with the sanction of armed force, a d a fixed Budget established, financial assistance would be merely thrown away. _ To sum up the present situation, there appears no immediate hope of financia reform, and the Government has no available financial 1 ‘ esC)Ur ^ s 0 w^ch obligations of the Persian Government, amounting to about .5,000,000/., of which 900 g 000Z. (400,000/. to the English and 500,000/. to the Russian Bank) are in the form of loans to private institutions, some of which are long overdue. On the o i hand there should be an ample margin, when order is restored, for paying ie in neb ’ [ 1072 ]on these loans out of the proceeds of the Customs, although the Assembly will resolutely refuse to give a pledge to that effect.

I HE present Commandant of the Cossack Brigade, Colonel Liakhoff, is a young man, probably not more than 34 or 35 years of age, who has served for some time on the General Staff at liflis, and has on more than one occasion been employed for reconnaissance work in Eastern Asiatic Turkey. During the ten months he has been in Persia he has had numerous difficulties to contend with. Up till about eighteen months ago the money for the payment of the brigade had always been regularly handed over to the Commandant, but about that time the payments began to fall into arrears, and latterly no money whatever has been disbursed by the Persian Government, who are apparently under the impression that liussia, sooner than see this force disbanded, will herself provide the necessary funds for its maintenance. The Russian Bank, however, after lending 80,000 tomans (1G,000Z.) for the purpose, have refused to make any further advances, and the Persian Government, though prolific of promises, have as yet shown no signs of producing any money, so the financial situation is at present a deadlock. Constant attacks on the brigade have been made in the Medjliss, where it has been alleged that these troops are maintained with Persian money entirely for the benefit of ^ Russia, and that the officers and men in the provinces are systematically employed in collecting and sending information on local matters to their head-quarters. The Shahsevans of the Saveh district, a, tribe which for many years has been to some extent under the control of the officer commanding the brigade and supplied a contingent of 300 men, complained to the Medjliss of the indignity of their position, and this agitation resulted in the discharge of 22 officers and 160 men. The number of small detachments sent to support the Governors in outlying towns and districts has greatly increased of recent years, and as these men now seldom receive the extra allowances to which they are entitled when absent from head-quarters, they frequently become discontented, and sometimes resort to acts of violence. Colonel Liakhoff has since his arrival persistently endeavoured to keep as many men as possible at Tehran, so as to have a small force under his immediate orders for the protection of Europeans if necessary; but out of a total strength of 1,500 he has still 800 away from head-quarters, and after reducing the outlying detachments wherever he can do so he does not expect to collect more than 800 men for the summer training camp, which is to commence at the end of this month. At present, out of the 700 men here, of whom 200 are artillery, 200 are supplied every night for patrolling the streets of Tehran. The task which lies before Colonel Liakhoff is, therefore, by no means an easy one, and unless some satisfactory arrangement is made for the regular payment of the men the future of the brigade is somewhat uncertain. It is undoubtedly an expensive force, as Persian ideas of military expenditure go, the total annual Budget amounting to 228,000 tomans (45,000/.). This is due partly to the number of pensioners, which is now 212, and partly to the abnormal proportion of officers, of whom, after the dismissal of the Shahsevans, there still remain 204, thirty of these having the rank of General Officers. The two items of pensions and pay of officers account for from a third to a half of the total expenditure, and, making allowance for this, the cost comes to a little over 20/. per man per annum. In case of disturbance they are the only organized body of troops available for the maintenance of order in the capital, and for the protection of the lives and property of foreigners, and it is, therefore, to the interest of all Europeans that they should be maintained in an efficient state. In connection with the affairs of the brigade, I may mention that Captain Xobaieff, the officer who was deputed last year to Tabreez to raise and organize a body of cavalry for the present Shah as Yaliahd, has since left the brigade, but remains in the Persian service as commandant of this force of 400 men. They form apparently a sort of body guard for His Majesty, but Captain Xobaieff appears to have little control ever them, and his position is somewhat of a sinecure. His successor in the brigade is a Captain Blaznoff. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. A. DOUGLAS, Military Attache,fair C.

Yon will observe that the disorders in the country are slightly on the increase, but do not as yet menace the safety of foreigners, whom the popular party are anxious to protect, for fear of foreign intervention. The proceedings of the Assembly show a marked increase in the dignity and orderliness of the procedure, but the conflict with the Government, and especially with the Shah, is becoming more accentuated. No real progress has been made in the proposed reforms. The Atabeg appears now to have given up hope of cordial co-operation with the Assembly, and the Shah’s hostility is no longer concealed. Fresh elections are spoken of. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPEING-KICE. Inclosure in No. 34. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. General Situation. THE general condition of the whole country is undoubtedly bad, and is probably slightly worse than last month. The disturbances at Tehran have been chiefly brought about by artificial means to serve the purposes of the reactionaries. There seems, however, no reason to regard it as dangerous, though the Government has every appearance of being bankrupt, and artificial demonstrations are of daily occurrence. There is so far no reason to fear an outbreak and consequent danger to foreign lives or property, though isolated cases of robberies and other crimes are occasionally reported from some of the provinces, especially in the north-west. It is on record that in 1892 and 1893, during the last years of Nasr-ed-Din Shah’s reign, the situation was very similar from much the same causes, though there was then no Russian debt and no Assembly. At Tehran a movement, headed by a prominent mollah, in opposition to the Assembly was subsidized by the Shah and his reactionary entourage. At one moment it seemed likely that an open conflict and bloodshed would occur, and this was only averted by the sagacity of the Liberal leaders. The want of money, which chiefly affects the Government and a section of the official and mercantile classes, is being used in the usual way as a lever to obtain foreign financial assistance. The Russian Loan Coupon, due the 14th July, has been paid, but the interest on the debts of the Government in current account—to the Russian Bank, at about 12 per cent., 500,000/. ; to the Imperial Bank, at about 12 per cent., 400,000/.; as well as about the same total due to Persian bankers—remain unpaid. The soldiers have been demonstrating for arrears of pay, but this yvas probably artificial, as it is no new feature. Some native bankers, who have large claims from the Government now overdue more than three years, took refuge at the Atabeg’s house, having probably been invited to do so. A large number of Government servants made a demonstration in the Artillery Square for arrears of pay, but were induced to return to their work under promises of a speedy settlement of their claims. Azerbaijan. . situation at Tabreez itself is apparently calmer, but outbreaks have occurred at Zenjan and Ardebil. At the former place the people wrecked Government House and ejected their Governor. At Ardebil there has been considerable bloodshed, and it is reported that over 100 people were killed and wounded early in Julv. Both outbreaks were apparently due to the elections.Resht. Agrarian troubles continue. The villagers in some districts still refuse to hand over to the land-owners and to the foreign grain importers the portion of cocoons to which they are entitled. At Talish the properties of the Governor were destroyed by the people. The Governor endeavoured to put an end to the agrarian troubles by arresting those who incited the people, and the situation had improved at the end of June, though the land-owners had suffered considerable losses. On the whole, the province is quiet. Meshed. The whole Province of Khorassan is remarkably quiet. No incident of note has been reported. Ispahan. On the 29th July one of the servants of His Majesty's Consul-General was beaten and imprisoned by some people who apparently bore him a grudge. They then delivered him to the Aghas, who sent him to the Consulate without a word of apology. The matter has of course been taken up by His Majesty’s Minister, and the necessary punishment, compensation, and apology, though it may take time, will be eventually wrung out of the local authorities. Yezd. Two hundred persons took refuge on or about the 15th instant at the telegraph office, which is also the Vice-Consulate. They protest against the oppression of the local representative of the Ministry of Finance, who has been sent to collect the taxes. Steps are being taken to remove the refugees. Kerman. The general situation in the south-east is normal. Kermanshah. Zahir-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Hamadan, arrived at Kermanshah on the 20th June, and succeeded the same day in dispersing the 2,000 refugees at His Majesty’s Consulate. On the 22nd June the Salar-ed-Dowleh was handed over by His Majesty’s Consul to the Zahir-ed-Dowleh, and shortly afterwards was taken to Tehran by Saif-ed-Dowleh, the Governor of whom we had complained. Zahir-ed-Dowleh will probably be confirmed Governor of Kermanshah. Shiraz. The general condition of Pars is normal. No. 35. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.-—{Received August 12.)

WITH reference to my despatch of the 12th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of a note addressed to me on the 23rd instant by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs respecting a delay of three years in the payment of sinking fund on the debt due by the Persian Government to British creditors.

Your Excellency, Tehran, July 23, 1907.^ YOUR Excellency is well aware of the energetic measures taken by the Imperial Government and the Sacred National Assembly for necessary reforms, establishment of financial equilibrium, and for the development of trade ; but it is obvious that these measures require reasonable time to be successful, and at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and the objects in view. The National Assembly, being alive to the friendship existing between the two States and the help always given by the British Government to promote the interests of this Imperial Government, have specially proposed to the Foreign Office that, by the help of the English and the Russian Representatives, a delay may be allowed for the payment of the coupons of the loans to the banks, i.e ., a delay of three years may be allowed during which nothing should be paid on account of the sinking fund, but only interest. When during the peiiod above mentioned the financial reforms in view are done it may become possible to increase the sinking fund in a suitable maimer so that the debt may be paid off sooner. It is hoped that by this friendly help the Persian Government and the National Representatives may have time to carry on the necessary reform, and to put the income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. With the perfect confidence that the Persian officials have always had in the friendship and good intentions of the British authorities, your Excellency is requested to bring this intention and request of the Imperial Government to the notice of the proper authorities, and to strengthen in this respect the good-will of the British Government towards that of Persia, in order that on the present occasion, when the Persian Govern ment is engaged in reforms, the British Government may increase the friendship between the two States by accepting this request, and helping in this matter, as they have always done, in the interests of this Imperial Government.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received September 3.) Sir, Gulahek, August 12, 1907. I HAVE the honour to inform you that on the 29th June a gholam in the employment of His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Ispahan was severely beaten by a mob in the suburb of Juifa on the charge of drunkenness, confined for the night, and sent the next morning to the Consulate with a letter unsigned, but delivered to Mr. Barnham by the servant of one of the Aghas, who have how the chief authority in Ispahan. In this letter the immediate dismissal of the gholam was demanded. 1 at once made very strong representations to the Persian Government, pointing out that the terms of the Treaty were clear that Consular servants were under British protection, and that they could not be punished without the sanction of the British authorities. The Atabeg and the Minister for Foreign Affairs at once recognized the gravity of the incident, and promised redress. The usual delay follow'ed, and I had to point out that I should be in duty bound to communicate to my Government what had occurred. I observed that it was somewhat unfortunate that, at the very moment when Persia was invoking a Treaty in order to obtain British intervention in the frontier question, the inhabitants of Ispahan should show such flagrant disregard for a solemn engagement signed in the name of God by the Shah of Persia. The Foreign Minister and the Atabeg both expressed the greatest regret, but they confessed that the Central Government was absolutely powerless. The town of Ispahan, since the departure of the Zil, was in the hands of the Aghas, who did exactly what they wished. The Governor had no troops, and the punishment of the guilty parties would lead to a riot, in which it was possible that Christians might.be the sufferers. I said that I would be content to postpone the question of punishment for a more suitable opportunity, and that I would also bear in mind the conduct of the Governor, who had omitted to express the regret which it was the custom among civilized nations for the Chief Magistrate to tender under similar circumstances. But the Central Government should do what it could. Finally, it was agreed that the Vice-Governor and the Karguzar, who had been in nominal charge of the city before the arrival of the Governor and during the incident, should call at the Consulate-General in uniform and express their regret, and that a sum of 100 tomans should be paid over as compensation. This was accordingly done. The net result is that the Consul-General will hold no inquiry into the conduct of the gholam, who wall receive compensation for his injuries on a liberal scale, and that the representatives of the Central Government will have expressed their official regret for the incident. But the incident cannot be considered as closed until the offenders have been punished. This, I trust, will be possible when the power is finally taken from the Aghas, who are at present abusing it in a manner characteristic and scandalous. The Assembly is perfectly aware of the nature of the present government in Ispahan, and has publicly condemned the recent violation of the Treaty, for which I have expressed my acknowledgments. The day of reckoning is sure to come. In the meanwhile I do not think it advisable to expose ourselves or the Atabeg to the attacks of the priestly element, which is very powerful; and, as we cannot send an expedition to Ispahan, w 7 e cannot use threats beyond a certain point. I am glad to be able to add that I have just heard from Bishop Stuart to the effect that there is no sign of any special measures against the missionaries, who are allowed to carry on their schools and hospital without interference. I consider that Mr. Barnham has acted with great discretion, forbearance, and tact throuohout this unpleasant incident, and I should be glad to be authorized to express your 'approval. His position is, of course, rendered extremely disagreeable by this unfortunate occurrence, and by the immunity^ of the aggressors^ Should another incident of this nature occur, the whole question will require serious consideration. Experience so far show’s that the threats of the priestly party are not as a rule carried into execution, and I trust that for the time the matter will be allowed to rest. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPBING-BICE.46 No. 39. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.— {Received September 3.) gj r Gulaheh, August 15, 1907. ’ I HAVE the honour to inclose the usual summary prepared by Mr. Churchill of events in Persia during the last month. The Russian Government still maintains its determination to abstain from armed intervention. Gun-boats have been sent to Enzeli, and the frontier force has been increased, but the Russian Minister assures me that he is convinced that, though it is necessary to make a show of force, small measures would be useless. The leaders of the popular party are quite aware of the danger of giving foreign Powers an excuse for intervention, and are doing all in their power to keep the peace and to prevent attacks on foreigners. The financial situation shows no improvement. There is great distress in the bazaars. The National Bank is still without funds. But the Finance Minister, actuated by the hope of receiving some assistance in the work of reform, has induced the Assembly to consent to the appointment of a foreign financial adviser, nominally to the Bank, but really to the Government. After a long struggle the Government has consented to invite France to name an expert. The sums due to the Imperial Bank of Persia are still unpaid, but I understand from the Finance Minister that serious efforts are being made to meet these engage ments. He has offered his resignation, which, however, has not been accepted. He will only withdraw it definitely on receiving a pledge that the Shah and the Assembly will consent to a scheme of reform which will be shortly submitted to them. The Assembly still continues to sit, and it celebrated the anniversary of the grant of the Constitution amid great scenes of popular enthusiasm. But it has done, and is doing, nothing of practical value. Its proceedings are disorderly, and it comes to no decision. The covert opposition of the Shah and his friends is conducted with considerable skill through a section of the priestly party, who are heavily subsidized. They have obtained some measure of success, and the reactionary forces show a considerable amount of vigour. But the popular leaders are not seriously afraid of these enemies, and confidently maintain that the restoration of autocracy in Persia is now impossible. The chief enemies of the Assembly are its own Members. There is great want of discipline, or power of common action, or the spirit of self-sacrifice. It is felt that unless the Assembly can do some definite work it will lose the confidence of the people, and both Government and Opposition agree that without the co-operation or submission of the Shah it is impossible to carry out any measure of reform. The Assembly has therefore decided to send a deputation with a humble address praying the Shah to show his confidence in the popular representatives, and to afford them his cordial and sincere support in the work of saving the nation. The leader of the Opposition assured me that he had no belief in the possibility of persuading the Shah to afford his co-operation; his enmity to the new order of things was too deep- rooted. But he believed that unless His Majesty received foreign support—that is, if Persia were left to herself by foreign Powers—the Shah would be forced to submit, and that as soon as he did so the Assembly could proceed to serious and effective work. A member of the Government, and an intimate friend of the Atabeg, expressed the same opinion. The Atabeg is in a state of great depression, is afraid for his life, distrustful of the Shah, and professes that he is anxious to resign. He is useful as a man holding a middle position between Shah and people, and possessing great experience and knowledge of the country, but he is quite incapable of organizing or administering a Government or of carrying out any thorough-going reform. His one idea is to get possession of a sum of ready money to tide over present difficulties. The want of money leads, indeed, to a geneial disorganization of the Administration. The War Mamster has been dismissed, and his successor has not been appointed. The road to Ispahan is infested by bandits, who make a practice of robbing the post. Ispahan is in the hands of the priests, who rule it according to their pleasure ; but it cannot be said that the disordei is greatei than has frequently occurred before, or that there is any special danger to foreigners. J r If, however, the present disorganization lasts much longer, and if nothing is done to restore the finances, the result may very probably be that foreign intervention will be the only means of restoring order. A large number of persons, including probably the Shah, look forvaid to such an event with satisfaction, A still larger number are47 'as ^ “gtiiti rsoftle 'case It attacks 1 in tie lister, indued minallr lent las lerstaud engage- d Be ssemllj e graut , and is s to DO i witl sidized, ihowa raid of ersia is iere is se the 'thout ire of ruble ndto eader g the deep- iat is, ibinit, ective ressed &gt;f the ling a ! and ring a ;o get noney nister pahan in the l that pecial inetc ill be determined to prevent it, but it cannot be said that they have as yet proved their determination by a willingness to sacrifice their own interests and selfish aims for the public good.

THE north-west of Persia continues to be in an unsettled condition, but the rest of the country appears to be normal, and the situation at Tehran is unchanged. Azerbaijan. The situation at Tabreez continues to be calm, but at Ardebil there has been a recrudescence of the disturbances reported last month. The Russian Agent has been the object of the attacks of the people, who looted his house. At Astara the buildings of the Russian fisheries have been burned. Prince Farman Farma, Minister of Justice, has been sent off in great haste to take over the Governorship of the province from Nizam-ul-Mulk, who was powerless to deal with the situation. Resht. Minor disturbances have occurred in the districts, but the town has remained quiet. Ispahan. An emissary of Sheikh Fazalullah of Tehran has arrived to form a party against the Tehran Assembly, whom he declares to be “ infidels and Babis ”; he adds that the effect of Parliamentary institutions will be to annihilate the religion of Islam. It is understood that the Tehran Assembly has sent a representative to counteract the influence of this emissary. The Aghas retain their influence, so much so that the Governor declared that he was unable to arrest the persons who beat the Consulate gholam, in view of the opposition of the Aghas, i.e., Agha Nejefi and his brother. Seistan. The mollahs of Seistan have been preaching in favour of a local Assembly, and telegrams on the subject have passed between them and the Tehran Assembly. The movement seems confined to the Clerical party, and is being opposed by the Deputy Governor. Kermanshah. The town continued quiet, as far as the rival patties are concerned, but robbery and murder are of constant occurrence, and the town cannot be considered safe at night for pedestrians. Bus hire. The spread of lawlessness in Bushire during the last few months is the subject of remark, and is attributed to the incapacity of the Governor. Quite recently the barber of the Residency sepoys was robbed on the high road only 2 miles from town, and a house in the town inhabited by an employe of a British firm was broken into and over 70/..worth of goods stolen. ^ ^ ° (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL. . Gulahek, August 15, 1907. ySupplement to the Monthly Summary. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan telegraphs that all trade is paralyzed by the insecurity of the roads, and that large bands of Bakhtiaris occupy the road between Sarkh and Nizamabad. He adds that every one who passed during last week was robbed, including two posts, and that the Governor declares he is helpless. (Initialled) G. P. 0. Tehran, August 15, 1907. No. 40. Sir Edward Grey to Sir C. Spring-Rice. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 7, 1907. YOU should concert with your Russian colleague as to making an identic official communication to the Persian Government in the following terms :— “Desiring to avoid any cause of conflict between their respective interests in certain regions of Persia, on the one hand, contiguous with or in the neighbourhood of the Russian frontier, and on the other of the frontier of Beluchistan and Afghanistan, the Governments of Great Britain and of Russia have signed a friendly Arrangement on the subject. ‘‘ The two Governments mutually agree to the strict independence and integrity of Persia by that Agreement, and testify that they sincerely desire not only the permanent establishment of equal advantages for the industry and commerce of all other nations, but also the pacific development of that country. Further, each of the two States binds itself to seek no Concession of any kind whatsoever in those regions which are conterminous with or in the neighbourhood of the frontier of the other. “In the Arrangement the above-mentioned regions are clearly defined in order that in the future misunderstandings may be avoided, and in order to avoid creating a state of things which might in any respect whatever place the Persian Government in an embarrassing situation. The Russian and British Governments recognize in mentioning the revenues affected to the loans concluded with the Discount and Loan Bank and with the Imperial Bank by the Persian Government, in the future these loans will be affected to the same purpose as in the past; and in the case of irregularities in the amortization or in the payment of interest of the loan above mentioned, the two Governments engage equally, in order by common agreement to determine the measures of control which it would be necessary to take, to enter on a friendly exchange of views and to avoid all interference which would not be in accordance with the principles laid down in that Arrangement. “ The two States have, in signing the Arrangement, steadfastly kept the fundamental principle in view that the independence and integrity of Persia should be respected absolutely. The sole object of the Arrangement is the avoidance of any cause of misunderstanding on the ground of Persian affairs between the Contracting Parties. The Shah’s Government will be convinced that the Agreement concluded between Russia and Great Britain cannot fail to promote the prosperity, security, and ulterior development of Persia in the most efficacious manner. Until publication takes place here the Persian Government should be requested to consider this information as confidential.” Should they inquire as to definitions of regions adjoining respective frontier, the following details might be communicated to them “Starting from Kasr-bShirin the Russian line crosses and includes Ispahan, Y’ezd, and Lakh, ending at that point on I ersian frontier where Russian and Af°'han frontiers intersect. Going fiom the Afghan frontier via Gazik, Birjand, Kerman, the British line ends at Bunder Abbas.Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey,—[Received September 30 .) Gulahek, September 13, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith translation of a note in Persian which I communicated to the Minister for Foreign Adairs and the Minister of Finance in compliance with the instructions contained in your telegram of the 28th ultimo, relative to the suspension of the sinking fund for three years. J have as yet received no acknowledgment from the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-KICE. Inclosure in No. 41. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Persian Government. (Translation.) Your Highness, Gulahek, August 31, 19u7- I DID not fail to transmit to my Government copy of your Highness note of the 23rd July relative to the request of the Persian Government that His Majestys Government should consent to the suspeusion of all payment on account of sinking fund for the space of three years. . His Majesty’s Government have learned with pleasure that the Imperial Govern ment and the sacred National Assembly are taking energetic measures for necessary reforms, the establishment of financial equilibrium, and for the development of trade. They have also taken note of your statement that these measures ^ require reasonable time to be successful, and that at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and of the objects in view. &gt; i v ir r They fully appreciate the sentiments expressed by your Highness on behali of the National Assembly as to the friendship existing between the two States, which they sincerely reciprocate. After duly considering the contents of your letter and the arguments which you have so ably urged, they have instructed me to consent to the request of the Persian Government that a delay of three years may be allowed during which nothing shou cl be paid on account of the sinking fund but only interest, in order that the Persian Government and the national representatives may have time to carry on the necessaiy reforms and put the income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. I am to add that, in consenting to this request, His Majesty s Government under stands that the following conditions will be observed : — Firstly, in accordance with the general law as to debtors and creditors, it is under stood that the Persian Government, on its side, will not contract any new foreign oan without giving their creditors, England and Russia, the option of advancing money on the same conditions. The reason of this condition will be plain to you, for according to law and custom a debtor who makes an arrangement with a creditor must engage not to incur new debts from other quarters without first giving the option to his original creditor. . . . , , Secondly, it is understood that the Persian Government, in the general interests of freedom of commerce, strictly maintains the promise made by the Atabeg on the 27th October, 1901, and confirmed in the present year, to the effect that (‘ the Persian Government will not grant to anyone the monopoly of coining silver in the ^y lte Mint, and that in the matter of the importation of silver all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, will be treated equally and without distinction.” , Thirdly, it is understood that His Majesty’s Government has consented to the request of the Persian Government, and to waive the rights secured to them by engage ment, in order that the Government and the Medjhss may have time to carry on the necessary reforms, and put the expenditure and income of the country on a pioper footing. If, however, to its great regret, His Majesty’s Government should learn Hat no serious effort is being made to carry out the reforms of which you speak, it is understood that His Majesty’s Government will have the right to demand pay men the arrears of sinking fund at any time within the next three years. I have, &amp;e. „ (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. [ 1072 ] ESir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey,—[Received September 30.) (Extract.) Gulahek, September 13, 1907. I HAVE the honour to state that on the evening of the 30th ultimo the Atabeg called on me and talked at length on the political situation. The general tenor of his observations was that the Shah would withdraw his opposition, the Medjliss would work with the Government, and that very shortly the Government would be able to put an end to the disorder which reigned in the country. I never saw him in better spirits. The next day the Atabeg and the Ministers repaired to the Palace and requested the Shah to accept their resignations unless he would solemnly pledge himsdf to co-operate with the Government and the Medjliss. They obtained the promise in writing, and repaired in a body to the Assembly. The proceedings of tne Assembly on that day were on the whole harmonious and satisfactory. The Atabeg read the Shah's statement, and explained that the Government and the Assembly would now be able to proceed to the serious work of reform. There was some opposition, but it was overruled. The majority of the Members showed their sympathy with the Government. The Atabeg left the Assembly accompanied by the principal Mujtehed, Seyed Abdullah. They reached the outer door of the Palace inclosure, and had just parted when the Atabeg was shot and killed. One of his assailants was captured, but wounded his captor and escaped; another, finding himself surrounded, shot himself. The body of the Atabeg was removed to his house in his own carriage, accompanied b}? two Seyeds. The body lay in his own town house, and preparations w T ere being made for a State funeral, but anonymous letters were received stating that the house would be blown up if any ceremonies took place. In obedience to orders received from the Shah, the body was quietly removed to Kum on Sunday night, the 1st instant, twenty-five hours after the murder, and four months after his return to Persia, I received the news of the assassination half-an-hour after it occurred through the energy of Mr. Brown, of the Imperial Bank. Mr. Churchill at once proceeded to the Atabeg’s country house to break the news to the family. I went myself to the Russian Legation, where I saw M. de Hart wig. We agreed that we should take no action in the matter beyond sending the Oriental Secretaries to the Shah to express our sympathy and condolence, and that if the Shah asked our advice, we should say that he had better avoid anything of a nature to excite public opinion such as the dissolution of the Chamber or the arrest of Members, and that he should, as far as possible, leave matters in the hands of his Ministers, the great Mujteheds, and the Assembly. Mr. Churchill accordingly made arrangements with his Russian colleague the following day. His Majesty received them at once in the presence of his Foreign Minister. They conveyed the message of condolence, and the Shah replied in a few formal phrases. Neither the Court nor His Majesty seemed to be much perturbed at the sudden death of the Prime Minister. The Shah gave no opening for observations on the political situation and the audience was purely formal. For some time lately rumours have been spread abroad through the local press and by word of mouth to the effect that the Atabeg was in secret collusion with the Shah tor the overthrow of the Assembly and the sale of the country to Russia. Statements to this effect reached me from Members of the Assembly. There can be no doubt as to the genuineness and intensity 7 of the feeling against the Atabeg. A French doctor, who attended one of the assassins some time before the muidei, assured Mu. Churchill that he and his friends were quiet and respectable persons of the middle class, imbued with the strongest feeling of patriotism, and ready to devote their lives to the service of their country. I he attacks on the Atabeg had lately gained in virulence, and had attracted universal attention. The subject was brought up in the House, and a vehement speech denouncing Saad-ed-Dowleh, who was supposed to lie the leader of the movement against the Atabeg, was made by the Chief Mujtehed, Seyed Abdullah. The President said that if the Atabeg resigned he would resign himself, because the Atabeg’s resigna tion would mean the immediate dissolution of tire House. The feeling of the majority of the House was in the Atabeg s favour, but popular opinion only saw in the support given him by the majority of the Assembly the evidence of a corrupt plot between his Highness and the majority, who were supposed to have been bought, as was certainlythe case with Seyed Abdullah. The excitement in the town was intense, and was exploited for their own purposes by the Atabeg’s personal enemies. Under these circumstances it was natural that resort should be had to extreme measures. The conspirators appear to have been in communication with one of the Secret Societies which abound in Tehran, and to have secured the admittance of some of their own adherents, wdio provided money and what appeared to be authentic information from the Court. It was easy to lead the members of the Society to believe that the destruction of the Atabeg was the only way to save the country; that he was in corrupt collusion with the Shah, and was about to obtain’ control of the Assembly in order to carry through another foreign loan with the active help of the President. Orders were given to remove him, and the deed was carried out on the very day when, as it appeared, his success was complete. Popular sentiment approved the murder, and the assassins were regarded as saviours of their country. The streets of Tabreez were illuminated. The result of the Atabeg’s murder is for the time to disorganize the whole system of government. As yet popular opinion seems united as to the justice of the Atabeg’s “ execution,” and it is quite evident that there is now in Persia an intense feeling of patriotism and a resolve to destroy any Persian suspected of a design to sell his country, which never existed before and which is a new element in Persian life. It may have been possible to make use of this sentiment in order to secure the removal of a prominent statesman, but it must now be evident to all that no statesman can disregard it with impunity, No. 43. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey,-—{Received September 30.) Gulahek, September 13, 1907. THE situation here has grown worse. The death of the Atabeg has increased the general disorganization of the country. Ispahan is in the possession of the great priests, who^ exploit the people and threaten foreigners. The road between Ispahan and Kum is occupied by an aimed body of Bakhtiaris, who rob posts and caravaos, maltreat travellers, and have practically put a stop to trade on the road to the capital. JChe Bakhtiaris have shown a marked disregard of the authority of the Government. The Englishmen employed by the D’Arcy Syndicate are in a position which is described by Captain Lorirner as one of great danger. t&gt; -j.- i i rn No attempt is being made to pay the interest due on the British loan, lire proceeds of the Bushire customs are diverted by the Government. ^ Even the Kermanshah customs, which were at first devoted to the payment of this claim, aie now paid into the bank with great irregularity. The Government has no available funds except the customs revenue, as the provincial taxes are not being paid ; The Shah is hardly able to meet his own personal expenses, and his servants are continually on strike. . , ^ 1 , . , , . A deputation recently called on the Mushir-ed-Dowleh and asked him to take office. He refused unless he was provided with money. He said that he would not take the dangerous responsibility of accepting a foreign loan, and that unless the Persian people supplied the funds necessary to carry on the Government, or consented to the Government finding funds elsewhere, all government would be shoitly 'Ptigj'g Jg ]}o sign of an agreement netween the Shah and the Assembly, 'without which the chaotic 'state of affairs must continue. The political Committees, who really rule the country, have a profound distrust for the Shah and his Mmisteis, and the Shah is known to be animated by a strong aversion for the new Constitution and the Assembly. British interests are likely to suffer from a continuance of the piesent state of ' It is not impossible that a new Cabinet may be formed on a popular basis which will be strong enough to enforce order and collect taxes. It would, I think be advisable to await events, for a time at any rate. If no improvement takes place before the spring, the Powers mainly interested will have to take measures to protect then- interests if they are thought of sufficient importance to warrant the necessary measures, [1072] ^ ^52 but in the meantime nothing should, I think, be done of a nature to excite popular fanaticism.

I HAVE the honour to inclose herewith the monthly summary of events. The Assembly shows clearly the growth of the opposition to the Atabeg, which he overcame temporarily with the help of the Sani-ed-Dowleh, who has now resigned the Presidency. His successor is the Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh, who has just arrived from Mosul, where he was serving as Boundary Commissioner in connection with the Turco- Persian frontier dispute. He was Persian Minister at Berlin for some time, but is chiefly known for his courageous attitude in May 1906, when he openly advocated reform and was exiled in consequence. He was determined, he said, to stay and devote himself to “ the work which had to be done ” and to the liberation of the Persian people. He is undoubtedly a man of courage and determination, and his leadership of the House is an important element in the present situation, and will greatly contribute to the efficiency of the Assembly.

The situation lias improved daily during the last month and is now normal. -Disturbances are reported from Khoi with some bloodshed. The new Governor-General is co-operating with the local Assembly ; he is gaining the people’s esteem, having reduced the price of wheat and bread. 1 n Ispahan. “• AH roads to Ispahan are quite unsafe for travellers on account of robbers. On theJspahan-Tehran road the post which left for Tehran on the 1st August was lobbed at Nizamabad. 1 his is the second robbery at the same spot in five weeks. Two Russians have on different occasions been' robbed. An Italian priest the new European agent of the tobacco regie, many Armenians, and others 1 have also suffered. The robbers are said to number thirty, and to have openly pitchedV 53 . tents near Tark, where they send down to ascertain when carriages are expected. They give their victims a letter to the Assembly, in which they give their names and challenge the Assembly to dislodge them. The robbers are stated universally to be followers of Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the Bakhtiari Chief; and Karib Khan, the Zil-es- Sultan’s master of the horse, is credited with being the organizer of the robberies. His Majesty’s Consul-General tried to obtain a guarantee for the safe passage of Messrs. Lynch’s caravans on this road. The Samsam-es-Sultaneh, who had been charged by the late Atabeg with the duty of clearing the road, appeared unwilling to act, and the Governor of Ispahan wrote disclaiming all responsibility. The latter, however, sent some Cossacks and armed road-guards up the road, and two posts came through unmolested. The want of security, however, prevents Messrs. Lynch forwarding goods. Bobberies have also taken place on the Bakhtiari road and on the^ Sultanabad road, while on the Ispahan-Shiraz road three posts were reported to be hiding in the villages from the robbers holding the road. _ &gt; . The town of Ispahan itself appears to be in complete disorder. Twice a week the followers of the Aghas parade on the great “ maidan,” most of them carrying fire-arms. Their numbers increase constantly, as men from villages owned by other landlords enlist as “ fidais ” in order to obtain the protection of the Aghas and to escape paying rent or other debts. These men are drilled by former members of the Zil s army who are sought out for the purpose. On the 13th August several Seyeds and merchants made their way into the local Assembly and demanded to know why the Aghas should have the monopoly of exporting grain to Yezd. They were turned out and beaten by order of Ag ha Norullah. The Aghas having tried to raise the price of bread, strong popular feeling was raised against them, which they diverted by announcing that the Zil-es-Sultan vas about to return to Ispahan. This led to the closing of the bazaars, and a telegram was sent to the Shah protesting against the Zil’s return. Six Seyeds were deputed to bring the telegram to His Majesty’s Consul-General with a request that he- would transmit it through the Legation. Finding the gates locked, and being refused admission, they went on to the Bussian Consulate. M. Lissovsky forwarded then telegram, but refused admittance to the crowd, who remained outside for three or four days while telegrams were passing to and fro. On the 19th August, aftei t e receipt of a telegram from the late Atabeg that the Zil-es-Sultan would certainly come, the crowd was withdrawn to the Masjid-i-Shah. The bazaars remained closer, tie “ fidais ” beating with chains any one who attempted to open his shop, and Mr. Bowman, of Ziecder and Co., being met by a crowd of these men while proceeding to his olhce was threatened by them. At the beginning of the agitation a fight took P la( ;f ^ Chaharsoo bazaar between some “ fidais” and the Zil’s men, and eight of fj 16 nc ais were wounded. It was pretended that two of them were dead, and then bodies were carried covered with blood, one very much alive, round the “ maidan with the objec of stirring up the passions of the people. When the Aghas found that they could no get what they wanted through the Bussian Consulate they sent the people to the Persian telegraph office with telegrams drawn up in the most offensive language, but without signature, which the Persian telegraph official therefore decline to sen . On the 23rd August the mob broke the windows of the Persian telegraph othce and threatened the official’s life. Next day they dragged him out of his office ™ the local Assembly. When he again refused to send telegrams without signature g a Norullah told the “ fidais ” to imprison him in the Masjid-i-Shah, but the Governor intervened and the Aghas released him. Next day he closed his office and removed to Julfa. On the 26th August, on receipt of a telegram from the Atabeg, the Aghas sent people to apologize to him, and he then reopened the Ispahan office. Meantime e bazaars remained closed, and Messrs. Ziegler have reported to the Consul-General that they have been warned by the Aghas that if they open tneir ofhce it will be looted. Yezd. Several caravans have been robbed in the vicinity, and sixty-five mounted robbers from Ears are reported to be on the Kerman road. Sixty road-guards have so far prevented them committing any robbery and are reported to have repulsed them aftei half-an-hour’s fighting. . , i at u Khosrow Khan, formerly a robber chief, has been given charge o the Meshed road. One of his men recently shot a shepherd dead for refusing to hold his horse. The body was brought to the British telegraph office at Yezd for His Majesty s Vice- Consul’s inspection. The latter not happening to be present, the official m charge o [1072] f 3the telegraph office assured the people who brought it that he would inform the Vice- Consul. The body was then removed. Shiraz. Several robberies have taken place on the high road to Bushire, including a Residency messenger, the Persian post, and a caravan of Messrs. Ziegler. Two men charged with assaulting a servant of His Majesty’s Resident, now staying at Shiraz, were brought before the Governor. They were accompanied by a noisy crowd. As a result of this hearing the offenders were sent to make their peace with Major Cox’s servant in his presence, and a message was sent hoping the solution would be acceptable. It was declined as inadequate, and eventually both the offenders were punished quietly at the Palace in the presence of the Resident’s Munshi. The Clerical party continue to attempt to usurp all authority and get the present Governor removed. The latter appears to be doing his best to preserve order, and His Majesty’s Minister was informed by the late Atabeg that he considered he was doing well and would support him. No. 45. C.

An anangernent was made for the payment of 30,000 tomans per month from the Rermanshah customs towards the settlement of these claims, but 17,000 tomans have already been diverted to the expenses of the War Department in Azerbaijan on the personal order of the Shah. Nothing appears to have been received from the revenue ol the telegraph Department, of the Caspian fisheries (which has already been pledged to a Russian creditor), or the Bushire customs.

THE dismissal of Saad-ed-Dowleh from the Persian Foreign Office, forced on the Shah by popular feeling, has been a severe blow to the Imperial prestige. In spite of the undoubted services which he rendered to the constitutional cause in its early days, Saad-ed-Dowleh was the object of the profound mistrust and dislike of the Assembly, which believed that his Excellency had undertaken to the Shah, in return for his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to rid His Imperial Majesty of the yoke of the Assembly. The first opposition came from the Minister’s own Depart ment, the officials of which', only a day or two after his accession to office, declined to serve under him. According to one account, the insubordinate stall were actuated merely by jealousy and personal interest. Under the indolent rule of Ala-es-Sultaneh, the real direction of the business of the Foreign Office had fallen into the hands of the Heads of Departments, who, with a few others, had formed themselves into a Committee, controlling all appointments, and enjoying the lucrative spods of the passport section. On taking office Saad-ed-Dowleh lost no time in making these gentlemen understand that he would be master in his own Department, and he proceeded, further, to introduce friends of Ins owm into some of the most responsible positions in the Department. Quarrels began on the very day of his first appearance,^ and the staff decided to make a bold effort to be rid of a too masterful Minister and of his intruding nominees. Another version represents the recalcitrant officials as devoted patriots, ready to sacrifice their careers rather than serve under a Minister believed to have sworn to destroy the newly acquired liberties of the country. Probably botli motives were at work, but, be that as it may, the patriotic cry at once gained the sympathy of the public for the strikers. Saad-ed-Dowleh, however, with the support of the Shah, set about forming a new staff. But the attempt filled, and Tehran enjoyed the spectacle of a Minister for Foreign Affairs locked out of his own office. On the 30th ultimo the President of the Assembly and Saad-ed-Dowleh were received in audience by the Shah, and Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh advised the Minister to resign. The latter stubbornly declined. The movement against him, he said, was the WO rk of his bitter enemy, Ala-ed-Dowleh, and so long as the Assembly made no specific accusation against him his duty, as a constitutional Minister of the Shah, was to letain office. On the 2nd instant Saad-ed-Dowleh appeared before tne Assembly, and though fie showed a brave front it was clear that his fall was inevitable. The same afternoon Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh waited on the Shah and informed His Majesty that the Assembly could not tolerate the continuance of Saad-ed-Dowleh in office. A few hours later his Excellency received an intimation that his resignation was accepted. Ala-es- Sultaneh was reappointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. # Saad-ed-Dowleh’s nominees having, however, succeeded in installing themselves at the Foreign Office, have turned the tables on the old staff, and Ala-es-Sultaneh now finds himself locked out of his office just as w r as his predecessoi ten dajs ago.

THE profound change brought about by the defection from the Shah’s party of the reactionary leaders, of which you were apprised by Sir C. Spring-Rice in his telegram of the 2nd instant, is, I think, of sufficient interest to warrant a detailed account of the circumstances attending it. There was little on the surface to indicate the sudden volte-face of the reactionaries. The chief cause must undoubtedly be reckoned to be fear. The murder of the Atabeg, which was the immediate cause of Sani-ed-Dowleh’s resignation, and the suspicion that the sudden death of Mushir-ed-Dowleh was not due to natural causes, had unquestion ably produced a very deep effect. The case of Nasr-ed-Din Shah notwithstanding, it may be said that the ruling classes have for long been exempt from assassination at the hands of the lower orders, so that the above-mentioned events, coupled with the consciousness of the existence of Secret Societies whose members were ready to sacrifice their lives for what they were led to believe to be their country’s good, could hardly fail to make an impression. The Shah, who had been obliged to hush up an inquiry into the Atabeg’s death, was, moreover, obviously incapable of protecting them ; and the ever-increasing popular hatred of the autocratic regime gave cause for apprehension that the vast riches accumulated by many of the reactionaries under the old system might some day be resumed by the Government in the name of the people. In the circumstances, then, it is not surprising that the reactionary leaders should have thought it prudent to throw in their lot—at all events, formally—with the Nationalists. The three principal actors on the Constitutionalist side were the President of the Assemblv, Ala-ed-Dowleh, and Amir-i-Azam, a nephew of Ain-ed-Dowleh and a young man of some strength of character. On their invitation a meeting of the highest Notables in Persia, including several members of the Kajar family, though none of the immediate relatives of the Shah, was held at Ala-ed-Dowleh’s house in Tehran on the 27th ultimo to consider the situation. Exactly what passed or what arguments w r ere used to persuade the reactionaries is not accurately known, but in the result a Memorial expressing the views of the meeting in the most uncompromising terms was drawn up for presentation to the Shah. It stated plainly that persistence in his present attitude of hostility to the Assembly would endanger the Shah’s throne and the dynasty ; that the petitioners had made up their minds as patriots to work loyally with the Medjliss ; and that unless the Shah consented to do likewise they could no longer remain his servants. I he Shah returned a verbose answer, which, in spite of the vagueness of its terms, was held to be a complete surrender. The same morning the whole of the reactionary party attended the Assembly, and, headed by Jelal-ed-Dowleh, the eldest son of the Zil-es-Sultan, took an oath to be loyal to the Constitution. It is early yet to forecast how long the alliance will last, but Persian opinion seems to be that, for the moment at all events, the reactionaries are sincere enough, and that the Medjliss has scored an important and lasting victory. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 54. M)\ Marling to Sir Edward Grey .’^[Received October 28.) ^ Tehran, October 10 1907* DURING the past month the general condition of Persia has not improved, from the provincial towns, with few exceptions, reports show that there is less security for life and property, while the general lawlessness in the country has not diminished. The authority of the Central Government is almost nil, and at best can only be exercised through the local Anjumen, and its influence with these bodies cannot always be counted on. . ± lr }. the ca P ital &gt; however, the prospects are somewhat brighter. The reform party is at tins moment certainly far stronger than it has ever been Wee the opening of the Me ijhss just a year ago. Ihey have succeeded in winning over the whole of the reactionary party, and it seems reasonable to hope that the Shah will now, left as heis without supporters except a few of his chamberlains, find himself forced to abandon ’the tactics by which he hoped to discredit the Assembly by showing its incapacity to govern. Those who believe in the national movement are confident of the future. They explain the failure of the Assembly to produce any practical reform by pointing to the difficulties with which it has had to contend; it had many enemies, the Governors of provinces and high officials, the Shah, and finally the clergy, whose power had to be effectually broken before the will of the people could prevail These objects have been successfully attained ; tyrannous Governors such as Zd-es-Sultan, Farman Farma, and Asaf-ed-Gowleh have been removed ; the Shah finds himself alone and without a party ; and by the passing of the additions to the Constitution and the debates over the question of bast, the Mujteheds have been taught that the new regime means to emancipaie itself from the yoke of the priesthood. But the difficulties in the way are formidable. The Treasury is empty ; there is no public force to maintain order and enforce the law ; the moral authority of the old regime has been destroyed by the local Anjumen, and the Assembly seems powerless to create any respect for itself; there appear to be no statesmen of constructive ability; taxes are being paid with the greatest irregularity, and even the framework of such elementary administration as once existed has well nigh disappeared. In fact, the work of the Assembly during the first year of its existence has been nearly wholly destructive, and in the process of clearing the ground for futuie reform a good deal that was worth preserving has perished. And it is to be feared that the work of reconstruction on democratic lines will prove beyond the powers of the men at the head of the movement. It is not a healthy sign that in the new Cabinet not a single Minister dares to take the smallest responsibility on his shoulders, but awaits the direction of the Assembly. Hence it results that the Medjliss, which from the beginning^ has been far too prone to interfere in ordinary administrative matters, is now assuming executive functions. To this tendency two other circumstances are also contributing, viz., the masterful character of the President of the Assembly, who is now the most powerful personality in Persia, and the formation of the Anjumen-i-Akaber, or Grand Committee. The creation of this body is practically the outcome of the Committee of Notables, whose recent secession from the autocratic party has so profoundly modified the internal situation. It is composed chiefly of the higher functionaries, with a fair number of military officers, and its President and Vice-President are Amir-i-Azam and Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab. It has no official standing, but it arrogates to itsell the right of givino’ advice to the responsible Ministers in the conduct of the business of the Departments. It is, of course, perfectly irresponsible, but the influence of its members is such that its advice cannot be disregarded. Its influence has, so far, on the whole been beneficent, but it is easy to see that a Minister less pusillanimous than those who form the present Cabinet might easily pome into conflict with it; while the dano-erous possibility of a quarrel with the President of the Assembly can never be very distant. The best thing that can happen is probably what the more intelligent 1 ersians hope for, viz., that out of it should be evolved the Senate provided for by the Constitution. . c Another obstacle in the path of reform is to be found in the composition of the Assembly itself. Only a very small minority of the members have even an elementary idea of what the functions of Parliament are. The rest are &gt; incapable of comprehending a regular code of laws regularly applied ; puch a thing is entire y outside their experience, and they probably look on the business of framing laws— which they cannot conceive will ever be enforced—as sheer waste of time. p he y would in fact, turn the Assembly into something between a Debating Society, a Court of Justice, and a Council of State. Not a few also look upon the position of Deputy as merely a means of pushing their own interests. It is hoped that with the diffusion of more correct notions of constitutional government the next elections will result in the return of more enlightened and less self-seeking legislators. The result of the first year’s work of the Assembly has been on the whole rather negative, but at least it has succeeded in asserting its will against the influence ot the Shah and clergy, and has now a reasonable prospect of being able to start on the path of reconstruction.

I llcLV‘0 (^£(3 (Signed) f ’ CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 55. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia. Tehran. THE Mushir-ed-Howleh died very suddenly on the evening of the 13th September. On the 27th September the Princes and civil and military officials of note, who had up till then formed the reactionary party, presented an ultimatum to the Shah declaring their adhesion to the Constitution and the National Assembly, and threatening to sever all connection with the throne should His Majesty not co-operate with the National party. His Majesty’s Minister had a farewell audience of the Shah the following day, when he presented Mr. Marling, the Charge d’Affaires. The Tehran “ Habl-ul-Matin,” which started a series of articles on the Anglo- Russian Agreement on the 9th September, continued to publish daily articles on the subject until the 16th September. The first two or three were undoubtedly inspired by Saad-ed-Dowleh, and showed some knowledge of the complex subject, but the subsequent articles were not written so well. Another paper, called the “ Tamaddun,” published an article on the 7th September, but, more engrossing local topics having arisen, the campaign ceased until the text of the Anglo-Russian Agreement was published. The c&lt; Habl-ul-Matin’’ again referred to the matter on the 7th September, and the following day published the full text of the Agreement as telegraphed out by Reuter’s Agency. It also published the Persian translation of the part of the Agreement relating to Persia, as supplied by His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government, together with the covering letter of the 24th September. On the whole the Agreement has been well received in Tehran. There has been a considerable increase of crime and robbery in the capital of late. An elderly Trench woman was brutally murdered in her own house by some soldiers. A wealthy merchant was attacked at night in his own house by a gang of masked robbers, who, after gagging and tying him up, robbed him of every article of value in the house. The Shah s grooms took a number of Mussulman women by force into the Shahs stables, and refused to open the doors when Ala-ed-Dowleh, who was informed of the occurrence, demanded entrance in order to rescue the women. Some valuable brocades were stolen from one of the Shah’s country houses while His Majesty was m residence there. Several Europeans have been the victims of common burglars, including two members of His Majesty’s Legation. I nnce Dabija, Russian Consul-General at Ispahan, is at Tehran on his way back to his post, but the road being in the hands ol a determined gang - of highway lobbeis, who have now actually pitched their tents on the road, Prince Habija has been detained at Tebian until such time as arrangements can be made to insure his safe passage. The new German college was formally opened on the 5th instant, when 500 invitations were issued. Rather more than half that number attended. The school has already been working for two or three months, and about 100 Persian boys attend. There are two German teachers and a number of Persians employed. One of the Gennaii teachers is described as being particularly capable, and good results are reported. Several of the Persian pupils already speak a little German. On the 0th instant, the fortieth day alter the assassination of the Atabe^-i- Azam, a great demonstration was made at the graveside of Abbas Agha, the murderer who committed suicide. Tents were pitched, and it is said about 15,000 persons collected. Speecheswvere delivered extolling the murderer of the Atabeg as a patriotwho had died for the good of his country. Large quantities of flowers were placed on the grave. The French Government have appointed a Financial Adviser named M. Bizot to proceed to Tehran, in accordance with the request of the Persian Government. His contract has been drawn up by the French Minister, and is for two years at the rate of 50,000 fr. a-year and 3,000 fr. travelling expenses, as well as 1,500 fr. a-year house rent. The draft contract was submitted to the House on the 10th instant at a secret The situation continues fairly quiet. The Governor-General is popular and continues to co-operate with the local Assembly. ^ He insists on the policing of the town beino- left to him. The soldiers get proper rations and have decent uniforms, and the Government ferrashes are paid regularly by the Assembly. The President told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that this c was the result of the action of the Tehran Assembly, and that the Governor-General was weak and incompetent, and would have to be removed. _ _ , . _ . A large number of revolutionaries of Khoi marched into the Maku district intending to kill Ekbal-es-Sultaneh, the Governor. The latter attacked and defeated them, killing, it is said, 200. The Governor-General and the Assembly have sent a Commission to investigate the There appears to be growing discontent against the local Assembly, which passes Decrees which are never carried out. The Governor has repeatedly sent in his resignation, but it has not been accepted. . , The President of the National Assembly told His Majesty s Charge d Affaires that it would eventually be foundmecessary to summon the Aghas to Tehran, and to replace the present weak Governor. It is to be hoped that this will be done soon, as the Governor has informed His Majesty’s Consul-General, in connection with the supply of guards for the protection of telegraph line inspectors, that he cannot guarantee their safety, as he is not Governor at all, the Aghas being in charge of the province. The Persian telegraph office has been closed by the people to compel the Govern ment to insure the safety of the roads, which continue to be infested by robbers. A^aravan has been robbed on the Kerman road. The road guards had one killed and five wounded in the skirmish. The local Assembly elections led to disturbances and to a crowd of people taking refuge at the British telegraph office.

It is therefore legitimate to conclude, and His Majesty’s Government have indeed good reason to beheve, that the above-mentioned revenues have been applied to other purposes. I have consequently received instructions from my Government to request your Highness to inform me what satisfactory reasons the Persian Government can adduce for diverting to other purposes revenues which have been formally pledged for the service of the British loan.

It might therefore have been expected that they would be accepted with alacrity. The mere fact of the request should naturally connote the most scrupulous regularity in the payment of the interest and t is therefore a matter of concern to His Majesty’s Government that their forbearance in the matter of the sinking fund has not met with the recognition it deserves I have the honour to request that your Highness will inform me without delay what reply I am to communicate to His Majesty’s Government. 1 7 I have, &amp;c.

HAYING learnt from His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah that the town was ao-ain in a serious state of disorder, shots having repeatedly passed over the Consulate to the danger of its inmates, I called on the Prime Minister to request that measures might be taken to restore order. It seemed clear, I said, from Captain Haworth’s report, that the originators of these disturbances desired merely to prevent the return of Seif-ed-Dowleh, the Governor whose incapacity had resulted in the events which led to a large number of persons taking bast in His Majesty’s Consulate in June last, and in shots’being fired on the building. I reminded his Excellency thap at the demand of the Legation, Seif-ed-Dowleh had made an official apology to Captain Haworth, and had further been recalled to Tehran, and said that in the circumstances I could not understand how the Persian Government could dream of sending him back to Kerman shah, and if the intention were persisted in I must regard it as a distinctly unfriendly act towards His Majesty’s Government. His Excellency said that the proposal originated with the Assembly. A party of Kermanshahis had come to Tehran to claim compensation from Seif-ed-Dowleh for losses caused to them when a part of the town was looted. The Assembly did not know how to deal with the question, and when Seif-ed-Dowleh promised to settle the claims, provided he were allowed to return to Kermanshah, his offer was accepted. He demurred to my statement that Seif-ed-Dowleh was recalled at the request of the Legation; he had been commissioned to escort Salar-ed-Dowleh to the capital. I said that I had a clear recollection that the demand had been made verbally, and though the Persian Government might have taken the above method of evading formal compliance with it, it made no difference to my view of the proposal that Seif-ed- Dowleh should return. His Excellency promised to do what he CDuld to prevent it, and a few days later informed me that the intention was abandoned. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHABLES M. MAULING. * I No. 59. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 25.) g‘ r Tehran, November 7, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a full translation of the text of the Constitutional Law as passed by the National Assembly and signed by the Shah on the 8th October, 1907. The Law reduces the Sovereign to practical impotence, but by far its most important part is that defining the powers of the Tribunals. Articles 71 and the succeeding Articles, although ambiguously worded, intentionally so, will, if carried into execution, deal a deadly blow at the judicial powers of the moliahs. The Couits of Justice are declared to be “the centres to which all suits must be referred,” and they will apparently decide whether cases should be dealt with by the Civil or Ecclesiastical Judges. The Ecclesiastical Judges will, it seems, be compelled to try their cases in the Courts of Justice, not in informal Tribunals held at_ their private residences or elsewhere, as has been the custom hitherto. It remains to be seem whether this sweeping change will in practice be accepted by the Mujteheds. Article 8G, also ambiguously worded, seems to grant the right of appeal against all decisions of the Civil or Ecclesiastical Courts to a Court of Appeal, instituted in accoidance with the Hegulations of the Ministry of Justice, ?.&lt;?., of a, civil power. If this interpretation be correct, it is obvious that a most effective restraint will be placed on the powers of the mollahs to give arbitrary and corrupt judgments. The Law is full of other important points, but many of these are so technical, so intimately connected with the whole course of the reform movement, that they can hardly be appreciated without a special knowledge of the question. I will therefore content myself with drawing your attention to the following Articles : Article 2. Giving the Ulema the right of censure over all laws passed by the Assembly.64 Articles. Granting equality before the-civil law. (See the interesting arid ingenious speeches of Taki Zade and Imam Jumeh of Khoi on this question, which, purposely raised by the late Atabeg, almost wrecked the Assembly last May.) Article 11. Ilestraining the arbitrary choice of Tribunals by suitors. Article 13. Inviolability of domicile. Article 18. Freedom of education. Article 20. Freedom of press. Article 21. Eights of association.

THE following are the Articles which, in order to complete the fundamental laws of the Constitution of Persia, have been added to the Constitutional Law signed by His Imperial Majesty the late Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah Kajar on the 14th of Zihaade-ul-Haram, 1324 (30th December, 1906) :— - - j General.

The National Assembly has been founded by the help of the Twelfth Imam, the bounty of His Islamic Majesty, the watchfulness of the Mujteheds and the common people. The laws passed by it must never to all ages be contrary to the sacred precepts of Islam, and the laws laid down by the Prophet. It is obvious that the decision as to whether the laws passed by the Assembly are in opposition io the precepts of Islam rests with the Ulema. It is therefore officially decreed that for all ages a Committee composed of five persons, who shall be Mujteheds and religious doctors, and who also must be acquainted with the requirements of the times, shall be elected in the following manner: The Ulema and doctors of Islam who are recognized by the Shias as the centre of imitation shall make known to the National Assembly the names of twenty of the Ulema possessing the above-mentioned qualities. The National Assembly shall, by agreement on casting of lots, elect five of them or more, according to the requirements of the age, and admit them as members. This Committee shall discuss and thoroughly investigate the Bills brought in by the National Assembly, and reject every one of these Bills which is contrary to the sacred precepts of Islam, in order that it may not become law. The decision of this Committee is final. Tnis Article will not be liable to change until the advent of the Twelfth Imam. Art. 3. The boundaries of the Kingdom of Persia, of its provinces, departments, and communes, cannot be modified except by law. Art. 4. The capital of Persia is Tehran. Art. 5.

I he Constitution, in part or in entirety, is not liable to interruption. Art. 8. The people of Persia enjoy equality of rights before the civil law. Art. 9. The life, property, domicile, and honour of every individual is secured andguaranteed from every kind of injury. No one can be disturbed except by order of, and in the manner defined by, the laws of the land. Art. 10. Except when found in jin grant e delicto committing crimes, misdemeanours, or important offences, no one can be immediately arrested except by a written order of the President of the Tribunal of Justice in accordance with law. Even then the offence of the accused must be made known to him at once, or at the latest within twenty- four hours. Art. 11. No one can be prevented from appearing before the Court which should decide his case, and be forced to refer the matter to another Court. Art. 12. No punishment shall be decreed or executed except by law. Art. 13. The dwelling-place and house of every individual is inviolable. In no dwelling-place can forcible entry be made, except by order of, and in the manner defined by, law. Art. 14. No Persian can be exiled or prevented from residing in anyplace, or forced to reside in any place, except in cases defined by law. Art. 1 5. No owner can be deprived of his land except by sanction of the Sheri, and then even only after the fixing and payment of a just price. Art. 16. r I he sequestration of the estates or property of any one as a penal measure is forbidden, except by order of law. Art. 17. It is forbidden to deprive land-owners or possessors of the estates or property in their possession, on no matter what ground, except by order of law. Art. 18. The study of teaching of arts, letters, and sciences are free, except in so far as they are forbidden by the Sheri. Art 19.

All primary and secondary schools must be under the direction and surveillance of the Ministry of Education. Art. 20. All publications, except heretical works containing matter harmful to the religion of Islam, are free, and it is forbidden to make distinction between them. Whenever anything contrary to the Law of Publications is found in them, the publisher or author will be punished in accordance with that Law. If the author is well known and resident in Persia, the publisher, the printer, and the distributor shall be secured from any action being brought against them. Art 21. Societies and Associations which do not provoke religious or civil strife are free throughout the realm ; but their members must be unarmed and must obey the regulations which the Law on this subject shall lay down. Meetings in the high roads or public squares must be held in accordance with the laws of the police. Art. 22.

Permission is not required to bring actions against Government officials for offences connected with their duties, except in the case of Ministers, in which the special laws enacted in this respect must be observed. Ti e Powers of the Realm. Art. 26. The powers of the realm spring from the people. The Constitutional Law defines the method of using those powers. Art. 27. The powers of the realm are divided into three parts Firstly, legislative power, whose province it is to make and amend laws. This power emanates from His Imperial Majesty the Shah, the National Assembly, and the Senate. Each one of these three sources possesses the right of originating laws; but their passing is conditional to their not being contrary to the laws of the Sheri, and to the approval of the two Assemblies, and to their receiving the Imperial signature. But the making and approval of laws relating to the revenue and expenditure of the realm belonged to the Mational Assembly alone.

Marling to Sir Edward Grey■.—^{tlecPi'tied November 2o.) (Extract.) Tehran } November 8, 1907. IN the season of Ramazan political or religious excitement is generally keener, and the fact that the past four weeks have practically coincided with that month has no doubt contributed to the increased unrest throughout Persia. The political horizon seems more threatening than ever, and I can see scarcely a single ray of light to promise better things. [1072] h 370 In the provinces the situation seems to be daily growing Worse In Shiraz the prospect has been so menacing that His Majesty’s Consul has been obi,gedto recoin- the increase of his guard. In Ispahan and the districts around lawlessness is rife, and the local authorities Ire so feebleVat they cannot or will not provide escorts tor two parties of Indo-European Telegraph Department officials, who have been detained for more than a mouth from starting on inspection duties along the line , and to-day I earn from Messrs. Ziegler’s agent that the clergy are trying to organize a boycott of European goods. In Kermanshah the prospect of the return of the late mcompeten Governor, Seif-ed-Dowleh, has been the signal for renewed disoiders. Astrabad, left without a Governor for seven months, is being pillaged with impunity by J utkomans, and the famous “ stage of terror ” on the Meshed-Tehran road has been the scene of savage outrages by these lawless marauders. . , , • •, i The Imperial Government is quite powerless to deal with the situation; it has no money and no force at its disposal, and for the same reasons its orders to the provincial authorities remain inoperative. , , w , Tehran itself, in the last few days of the month, has been deeply disturbed by a strong movement to depose the Shah. _ . r. i • i i Late in October a new Cabinet came into office, for the formation of which the Assembly is solely responsible. It contains, on the whole, the most capable set of Ministers who have held office since the beginning of the constitutional regime a year ago, and great hopes are reposed in it. Recent speeches in the Chamber prove that the Cabinet possesses the complete confidence of that body, but nevertheless the weakness which characterized the last Administration is as marked as ever. Rven Naser-ul-Mulk, the Pume Minister,^ is unwilling to accept the most trifling responsibility unless he is assuied that lus action has the approval of the Assembly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is scarcely better, and the transaction of business, even in quite unimportant matters, is exceedingly slow. Executive authority is at a very low ebb. As regards the financial question, a loan seems inevitable. ^ The Treasury is empty, and without money to pay some kind of public force the restoration of order and security is impossible. Naser-ul-Mulk talks optimistically of disbanding the present army and organizing a military gendarmerie on a modest scale. It would probably be the best plan in the circumstances, for I am assured that it the Government were able to give a single sharp lesson to the forces of disorder in any town the rest of Persia would take it to heart. There seems to be no material with which to officer such a force, and, above all, there is no money. Naser-ul-Mulk recognizes that without Great Britain and Russia nothing can be done, and seems to hope that the two Powers will come to the assistance financially. I have suggested to him that he should await M. Bizot’s arrival to give him advice before taking any step. No. 61. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward (xrey.—(Received November 25.) Sir, Tehraiii November 8, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the monthly summary of events during the last four weeks. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 61. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events. Tehran. A NEW Cabinet was formed on the 26th October by the National Assembly and approved by the Shah. The members of the new Cabinet are as follows :— Minister of Finance and President .. .. Nasr-ul-Mulk, G.C.M.G. Minister of the Interior (including posts, telegraphs, municipality, police, &amp;c.) . . Assef-ed-Dowleh.n Minister of Foreign Affairs .. Minister of Justice Minister of War Minister of Education (including public works, mines, roads, forests, &amp;c.) Minister of Commerce and Customs Musbir-ed-Dowleb, C.C.M.G. Mukhber-es*Sultaneh. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek. Sani-ed-Dowleb. Motamin-ul-Mulk. Assef-ed-Dowleb, the Minister of the Interior, was Governor-General of Khorassan until the spring of 1907. He was dismissed at the instance of the National Assembly, having been charged with complicity in the sale of Persian women and children to the Turkomans. He was tried at the Ministry of Justice by Prince Farman Parma and found “ not guilty.” Mushir-ed-Dowleh is the eldest son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh, whose title he inherited. He was until lately Minister at St. Petersburg!!. Motamin-ul-Mulk is the younger brother of the Foreign Minister. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh and Sani-ed-Dowleh are brothers. The latter was President of the National Assembly until the beginning of September. All the members of the Cabinet, with the exception of the Minister of the Interior, are highly educated Persians of the modern school, each knowing one or two European languages. Tabreez. The district of Khoi continues disturbed, the Commission sent there having failed to settle the dispute. Ekbal-es-Sultaneh is blocking the roads, including that to Trebizonde, with the result that trade, including English trade, is suffering. The Governor appears to be giving the revolutionaries a free hand, being afraid of meeting the same fate as the Atabeg. Justice is administered, even in cases of murder, by the local Assembly. A murderer took refuge in the British Consulate-General, but Mr. Stevens had him turned out. He was arrested by the revolutionaries, who handed him over to.the relatives of the murdered man. The latter brutally murdered him in the streets. llesht. Vezir Akrem has been dismissed from the Governorship of Ghilan, and Amir Azam has been appointed in his place. The latter arrived on the 3rd October and repeated the expressions of friendship towards Great Britain which he had already used in conversation with a member of His Majesty’s Legation before leaving lehran. Since his arrival he has taken energetic steps to put an end to disturbances which are now less frequent than before. Ispahan. Caravans continue to be robbed on the Ispahan-Yezd and Ispahan-Shiraz roads. Near Yezdikhast a party of over 100 robbers made off with eighty-four mules and donkeys loaded with piece-goods, opium, &amp;c. Seistan. His Majesty’s Consul reports that during his summer tour in the Kamat he everywhere met with the friendliest reception. Kerman. Two caravans have been looted on the Kennan-Bunder Abbas road, four drivers being killed in one case. . . Merchants have telegraphed to stop the dispatch of any more goods until the state of the roads have improved. The post from Bunder Abbas has also been rob bee. _ The disturbances due to the elections for the local Assembly continued during October. The Governor seized the popular leader, Nazim-ut-Tujjar, and deported him. Subsequently he ordered his troops to tire on the mob, who had come to demand t he return of their leader, and five or six people were killed and several were woum ei , [1072] b 4The crowd took refuge in the British telegraph office and the Bussian Consulate* ‘ ll id telegraphed to Tehran demanding the removal of the Governor. ^ The matter was taken up by the Tehran National Assembly and the Governor was dismissed, but so tar no one has been definitely appointed to succeed him. Shiraz. Several minor British claims have lately been settled, and compensation has been paid for the property of Besidency messengers stolen when the official bags veie robbed ; major claims, however, remain unsettled. ^ A certain Seyed Abdul Hussein Lari arrived at Shiraz on tlm 13th October with seventy followers to support the “ Majliss-i-Milliwhich was agitating against the return of the Kavam-ul-Mulk and his sons. He is stated to have been invited and paid by Motamid-i-Divan. He was welcomed by the bulk of the population, his avowed intention being to break the power of the Kavamis. On the 18th October, a briday, the Imam Jumeh having declined to allow the Lari Seyed to conduct the prayers at the mosque, proceeded there escorted by armed men to conduct them himself. The Lari Seyed’s adherents opened fire on the Imam Jumeh’s party, who replied. One man was said to have been wounded. Both parties then raced for the telegraph office, the Kavamis getting in and shutting out the Seyed’s party. Later in the day some Kavamis surprised some of their opponents and wrested nine rifles from them. From the 18th October to the 23rd the disturbances continued, with occasionally brisk firing from the Persian telegraph office held by 400 Kavamis, and a mosque held by 1,000 of the Seyed’s party. On the 20th October the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who from the 17th October to that date had remained outside the town declining to conduct the adminis tration of Fars, resumed the conduct of affairs. On the 22nd October a follower of the Seyed was shot dead and tw r o others were w ounded. On the 23rd October the bazaars were partially closed, all business being practically suspended. At the end of October firing went on in the streets and the situation was wmrse than ever, as the Nizam-es- Sultaneh left Shiraz for good. The latest new r s received at Tehran, the 6th November, was that the situation w as calmer. A German subject w r as waylaid by robbers a little distance from Shiraz and robbed of everything he possessed. Bunder Abhas t A large caravan, partly owned by eleven British-Indian subjects, who accompanied it* was robbed on the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road in September. Claims to the amount of over 1,700 tomans have been lodged at the Consulate* Ling ah i Serious rioting took place Owing to the Persian Director of Customs insisting on examining the personal effects of pilgrims. The Director w r as roughly handled. The Customs were closed, and trade paralyzed. The Governor, the Darya Beggi* arrived on the 22nd September and held an inquiry ; the parties Were reconciled, and the Customs reopened ; but the same afternoon the Director addressed his followers, urging them to close their shops and insist on redress being afforded him by the Governor. The Director of Customs at Bushire is replacing the Director, and the Deputy Governor has been dismissed for not aiding the Customs staff during the riots. AhuaZt His Majesty’s Vice-Consul arrived at Batwaiid accompanied by a representative of the Bakhtiari Khans, and the ringleaders in the recent troubles at the Oil Syndicate’s Works were soundly beaten in his presence, Supplement to Monthly Summary^ November 8* 1907, In Ispahan and the districts are so feeble that they cannot or hptiham around lawlessness is rife, and the local authorities will not provide escorts for two parties of Indo-European Telegraph department officials who have been detained lor more than a month from starting on inspection duties along the line. His Majesty s Eegation has made repeated but fruitless efforts in the matter. The clergy are trying to organize a boycott of European goods. Meshed. Astrabad has been left without a Governor for many months, and is being pillaged with impunity by the Turkomans. The famous “stages of terror on the Meshed- Tehran road have been the scene of savage outrages by these lawless marauders. T hey are said to have killed eighty-three persons, and that their own casualties were forty. They later on attacked the copper mine near Miandasht, killed seven men and captured fifty women and many sheep. The latest news is that they have since been repulsed by the villagers at another place on their retreat, and that the women and sheep were rescued. The Assembly appointed Sepahdar to lead a punitive expedition against them, but this official apparently now refuses to proceed. No. G2.

I HATE the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note which I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to that in which Sir C.

I HAVE had the honour to receive his Excellency the Minister’s note dated the 15th Shaaban, 1325, a.h., equivalent to the 24th September, 1907, transmitting a copy of the portion of the Agreement concluded between the British and Russian Govern ments relating to Persia, and composed of a Preamble and five Articles. I have the honour, in reply, to state that, as you will readily in justice admit, the above-mentioned Agreement having been concluded between the British and Russian Governments, therefore its provisions will concern the aforementioned Governments who have signed the Agreement; and the Persian Government, in view of the independence of which by the grace of God it is in full possession, considers the full rights and freedom which it enjoys by its absolute independence absolutely free and pro tected from every possible effect or influence of any kind ot Agreement between two or several foreign States regarding Persia, and will make every endeavour regarding its relations with friendly Powers for the strengthening of the structures of friendship and unity, in accordance with the stipulations of sacred Treaties, and the principles of the open door for international commerce. Regarding the loans also, it is evident that the Persian Government will observe without fault the stipulations of the Agreements which have been entered into regarding them. In order to communicate the principles exposed and stipulated in this note a copy of it is being sent to the Representatives oi the friendly States accredited to this Court. I avail, &amp;c.

I HAVE received your despatch of the 31st ultimo respecting the non-payment of the interest on the British Loan of 1903-4 and the request of the Persian Government for the temporary suspension of the sinking fund of that loan.

(Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 1, 1907. IN spite of strong and persistent representations, the Persian Government have taken no steps to cope with the Shiraz situation. On the 29th November a servant of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz was wounded close to the Consulate gates in a scuffle ensuing on a brutal assault on another servant who was robbed by Kashgais. The sowars captured one Kashgai. He was handed over to the local authorities after giving the names of his accomplices. But the former deny his statements, and attribute the outrage to the opposite faction. I am making strong representations on the subject to the Persian Government. No. 65. Mr. Marling to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received December 2.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 2, 1907. I AM making strong representations to the Persian Government in pursuance of the following report telegraphed from Bushire yesterday :— “ A report from His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas states situation there serious, and that neighbourhood is being raided by a large body of Baharlu (adherents of the Kawam-ul-Mulk), by whom town may be attacked. “ In order to protect British interests, Resident has made arrangements for His Majesty’s ship ‘ Lapwing’ to proceed to Bunder Abbas.” No. 66.

IS VOLSKY reverted again to dangerous situation at Tabreez, and told me that additional protection was being clamoured for by Russian Consul. It was a puzzle to him what course should be taken—-whether he should make a military demonstration on the frontier or merely dispatch an additional guard of about twenty-five men. Former step might have serious ulterior consequences, whereas latter step might be inadequate and to a certain extent risky. The General Staff* and the Minister of War were both against any military demonstration at this season of the year.Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received December ll.) (Telegraphic.)

I have demanded that persons primarily responsible for disorders should be removed from Shiraz. No. 68. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 15, 1907. DISORDERS are threatening here. Violent speeches, denouncing the Shah and demanding.the exile of the Shohs Chief Adviser and Agent, Saad-ed-Dowleli and Amn Bahadur Jang, were made yesterday at a popular meeting at the principal mosque. ^ The Ministry has resigned, but the Shah refuses to accept resignation. This morning an excited crowd gathered outside the Assembly, but was dispersed by armed men sent by the Shah. Colonel Liakhoft* refused to send Cossacks to maintain order when requested by Assembly. I shall do my best to keep people from taking refuge in the Legation, No. 69. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 15, 1907. ALA-ED-DOWLEH, who was sent to the Palace by the Assembly with a message, and another brother of President of Assembly were arrested by the Shah at 3 o’clock this afternoon. Shah sent for Prime Minister at 5 P.M., put chains on him, and threatened to kill him five hours after sunset. I have sent to demand assurances for Nasr-ul-Mulk’s safety from the Palace, and am requesting co-operation of Russian Minister. I propose to go myself if I do not get them. Everything points to there being serious trouble during the night. * I No. 70. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 16.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 16, 1907. ^ NASR-UL-MULK is exiled, and leaves for Resht to-day. As he fears Shah vyill attempt his life on the way, he begged me to send a member of the Legation with him, as was done when the late Atabeg was sent to Kum in 1897. Ibis, I said, I was for the moment unable to do. I am, however, sending two gholams. On his arrest (see my telegram of the 15th instant) the Assembly dispersed, and the Anjumans, on which its real power rested, remained inactive. The other Ministers have all resigned. They were summoned to the Palace and were practically under arrest there till they also left the Palace when Nasr-ul-Mulk was released by my demand on his behalf. I have tried to let it be known that I will not permit the Legation to be used, as a political tool, and I have stood entirely aloof except for intervention on behalf of Nasr-ul-Mulk, which has had an excellent effect. The bazaars are closed. Armed partisans of Shah have occupied principal square since midday yesterday. For the present his coup d’e'tat seems to be successful.

A few parties of them are parading the town, with the obvious intention of provoking disorder.

Their action seemed reasonable in M. Isvolsky’s opinion. The urgency of the situation, which did not permit of the two Representatives applying for instructions to their Governments, was explained y the Russian Minister. The results of the steps taken will now be awaited by M. Isvolsky. The Shah had, M. Isvolsky said, been frequently appealing for_ assistance to the Russian Legation, but they had maintained a policy of strict non-interference. The question of asylum being granted to the Shah m some foreign Legation incase of urgentneed and of Ids being protected there by Russian and British guards lias, at the same time, formed the subject of telegraphic communication from M.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 23.) Sir, Tehran, November 25, 1907. THE Report which I received by post from Mr. Grahame showed the situation in Shiraz to have been so far more serious than his telegraphic messages had led me to believe, that I at once wrote to the Prime Minister privately on the subject. I called his attention to the danger to which British lives and property had been exposed, and pointed out the urgent necessity that Ala-ed-Dowleh, the newly-appointed Governor, should at once proceed to his post, so as to prevent the recurrence of such a situation; and I asked his Excellency to give me an interview as soon as possible. Owing, however, to the Cabinet crisis, I Was unable to see his Excellency until to-day, though he sent me a letter saying that the Government were doing all they could to restore order in Shiraz. This morning I found Nasr-ul-Mulk so preoccupied with the situation in Tehran that it was difficult to bring him to the question of Shiraz affairs, but at length he said that he hoped Ala-ed-Dowleh would leave in a day or two. The new Governor was most unwilling to go, and had only consented to do so on condition of having a free hand. He would take with him Kavam-ul-Mulk, and would have authority, if he thought it necessary, to raise a force of irregular cavalry from the Bakhtiari as he passed through Ispahan and from the local tribes of Ears. I told his Excellency that the experiment of allowing Kavam-ul-Mulk to return to Ears was full of danger, and that if my appreciation of the situation there was correct the real remedy was to remove him and Motamin-i-Divan with some two or three others from Shiraz altogether, and let it be known that they would not be allowed to return. His Excellency did not deny that this would be the best course, but allowed me to understand that the Government did not feel strong enough to adopt it. _ I said it was much to be regretted, but that bad as this was the idea of trying to restore-order by means .of .the wild tribesmen was worse. The men were utterly undisciplined, and probably, even if officered by their own Chiefs, could not be restrained Rom every kind of excess. I thought the Persian Government wererunning the gravest risks of seeing all the districts round Shiraz pillaged and laid waste, and I must deprecate the proposal in the most earnest manner that I could. His Excellency seemed to he impressed by my remarks, and I do not believe that the experiment will be made, but that it should have ever been entertained is an alarming confession of the impotence and incapacity of the Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. P.S.

M. M. No. 83. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 23.) (Extract.) Tehran, November 25, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith extracts from the diary of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, giving an account of the recent Turkoman raids into Mazinderan and Khorassan, and even as far as Mazinan and Miz Haidan, on the Meshed-Tehran road. There are considerable numbers of Russian subjects in the districts nearer the frontier, and particularly in the neighbourhood of Sabzawar, and their situation has become so critical that the Russian Legation has twice addressed official warnings to the Persian Government that it may become necessary to send Russian troops across the frontier to protect them. With considerable difficulty the Persian Government have at last succeeded in persuading Sepahdar to take command of the operations against the Turkomans, but his Excellency is proceeding to the scene of his future activities with the greatest deliberation, and on the 22nd had only reached Resht, whence he will proceed by sea to Bender-i-Gez. A certain quantity of rifles and ammunition is being dispatched hence to Astrabad, and a force of infantry from the Khorassan army is said to be on its way to that place. Inclosure in No. 83. Extract from the Diary of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed. The Turkoman Haid. November 7.— From information received, it appears that the Turkomans first showed themselves at Shafiabad, in Juvain, where they killed 83 men, themselves receiving 40 casualties in killed and wounded. They then attacked the copper mines near Miandasht, where they killed 7 men and captured about 50 women and many sheep. They then spread, and raided Miandasht, Abbasabad, Mazinan, Miaomai, Nardin, Daragez, and Faramin. At the two latter places they captured 71 persons. All these places are on or near the Tehran-Meshed road. They are now encamped in tents, with banners fiying at the above places. Their numbers have been variously estimated, but from a comparison of the various telegraphic reports there appear to be about J ,000 or more. It is reported, further, that they have killed 100 and captured 200 “sarbazes,” who were on the march under the Muzuffer-i-Nizarn, on transfer from Meshed to Tehran. This is probably exaggerated. They have raided also in Bujnurd, and the Shuja-ul-Mumalik, Acting Governor, has reported that he has defeated them and killed thirty, whose heads he is sending into Meshed. Hitherto very little has been done to punish and oust the Turkoman. The local Medjliss held a special sitting, which the Shaukat-ud-Hole, Timuri Chief, the Shuja-ul- Mumalik, Hazaxa /Ihmf, and the Lashkar-navis-bashi, Accountant-General of the army of Khorassan,'were called on to attend. The Shaukat-ud-Dole said he was quite ready to give good advice, but couldsupply no sowars unless Government were prepared to find the necessary money. Ihe Shuja-ul-Mulk quoted poetry, and said that he and his brother had been robbed by an oppressive Government, and now not a single Hazara sowar ever remained. If, however, Government would find the funds, he and his brother could together raise 200 men. The Lashkar-navis-bashi said that there were plenty of men, but no money. He added pathetically that of course many of these men existed only on paper, and ol those that did actually exist many had withered hearts, and so could go on service only if the special grace of God were to descend upon them. Finally the Medjliss resolved that the Government should be called upon to furnish these Chiefs with the necessary funds, and that then the latter should give an under taking to produce the fully-equipped sowars. A letter was accordingly sent to the Governor-General instructing him to find the money required. Meanwhile the Ruku-ud-Dole had been receiving urgent telegrams from Tehran pressing him to take action. He also wired repeatedly to the Shah in person, askingfor help and instructions, but failed to elicit any reply. Then he held a long consultation with the Vizier and the Salar-ul-Mukurram, the result of which was that they proceeded in a body to the store-rooms and took out a considerable quantity of rifle ammunition for dispatch to the Governor of Sabzawar. It is reported, however, that no rifles were sent, as these had all been previously removed by the Asaf-ud-Dole and the Muzuffer-ul-Nizam and sold for their private profit. Further, two guns have been ordered from Meshed to Sabzawar, and 500 of the Kerai regiment (infantry) from Turbat-i-Haidari. One hundred cavalry have also been ordered from the latter place, but it is doubtful whether these will be forthcoming. No. 84. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received December 23.) Sir, Tehran, December 4, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the monthly summary of events in Persia for the last four weeks, as well as a summary of the proceedings of the Persian National Assembly for the same period. I have, &amp;c, (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure 1 in No. 84. Extract from Monthly Summary of Events in Persia, Tehran. THE principal subject of interest at Tehran during the month under review has been the struggle between the Shah and the Assembly, which is reported upon fully elsewhere. A serious affray occurred on the 21st November between some soldiers of a native regiment under Amir Behadur and some Cossacks under Colonel Liakhoffi On the 27th November some soldiers under Zafar-es-Sultaneh shot two men in the streets of Tehran while under the influence of drink. The bodies of the victims were taken to the house of the Mujtehed Seyed Abdullah, and the bazaars were temporarily closed. Several cases of violent assault and robbery in the streets of Tehran have been reported during the month, and in one case a European was threatened. Early in November His Majesty’s Legation heard of the impending departure of Prince Seif-ed-Dowleh to Kermanshah as Governor, notwithstanding the promise given by the Prime Minister that he would not be reappointed to that post in view of his unfriendly attitude to us. Renewed representations were immediately made, and his departure was prevented. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL, Acting Oriental Secretary.The town was, towards the end of October, kept in a state of disorder by the “ fedais,” or volunteers, who fear no one, and are reported to have collected a large sum of money by extortion from rich inhabitants of the town. They tried to prevent the sale of bread to Armenians, but this the Governor prevented. Business was almost at a standstill, and the population generally in a state of despair. The country around was also much disturbed, especially Karadagh, Khoi, and Salmas. Later reports state that the situation is calmer. Khoi and Maku are quiet, and caravans are able to move on the Trebizonde road ; Karadagh is still infested by brigands, and Kurdish tribes are reported to be pillaging within 2 miles of Sonjboulak. 3, On the 16th November the Mussulman teacher of the Kussian school was molested and wounded by some roughs who fired some shots at the building.^ The man being a Kussian subject, the Kussian Consul-General has demanded satisfaction and the punishment of the culprits. Resht. The Amir Azam, the new’ Governor, is taking energetic measures to restore order. He is of opinion that the “ Abbasi” Committee is the cause of most of the disorders, and he has had several of its members imprisoned and bastinadoed. This led to a large number of people declaring their intention of taking refuge at the British and Kussian Consulates. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul was interviewed by a representative of these people, and advised them strongly to abstain from taking refuge and to refer any complaint they had to the National Assembly. The Governor having sent some sowars to Kama, the inhabitants of that place imprisoned them. The Governor was about to inflict exemplary punishment on the offenders, but pardoned them at the instance of the hereditary chieftain of the district. Aslrabad. The British Agent reports that during the latter part of October large parties of Turkoman horsemen raided villages near Astrabad, killing a few men and carrying off some women and cattle. Meshed. “ Yamut ” Turkomans, from the Atrek, raided Miandasht and Juvain in the latter part of October. , . . _ . x1 Apart from the activity of the Turkomans, the Province of Khorassan and the town of Meshed have remained undisturbed. Ispahan. The situation at Ispahan during the month has been comparatively qiliet. The Aghas have forbidden all trade with European firms, but have Carefully abstained from forbidding trade in foreign goods, as they are partners in a native Association wdiich deals in foreign goods. This has called forth a protest from Messrs. Ziegler and Co., and the Ispahan agents of Messrs. Dixon also report that they can do no business by daylight for fear of the Aghas. Persian merchants dealing with European firms have explained to the Aghas that they cannot close their accounts at a moment’s notice. The Aghas have accordingly given them four months within which to close them. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires having brought the matter to the notice of the Foreign Minister, the latter submitted it to the Cabinet, w 7 hich decided to take measures to remove Agha Norullah from Ispahan if he continued to interfere with foreign trade. The Kussian Consul-General has also reported the matter to his Legation. Shiraz. Shiraz continued disturbed towards the end of October, and much firing took place. Several bullets having lodged in the town office of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, the office was temporarily closed. In _ the first week in November the two contending factions were reported to have received reinforcements, the Laris by contingents from Jahrum and from the Kashgais. the Lari faction then occupied two mosques in the towm. The Kavamis w 7 ere reinforced by Arab tribesmen, Kashgai tribesmen also overran the country south^ and^ west of Shiraz. On the 2nd November the Laris addressed a letter to His Majesty s Consul stating [1072] Ct82 that the arrival of the sons of the Kavani would lead to a fight and the lives of Europeans would be endangered. On the same day th e Kavamis addiessed Mr. Orahame a letter, in which they accused the late British Agent of aiding the Laris, which, however, he denied. On the 3rd November the Ooveinor,^ Nizam-es- Sultaneh, left for Tehran, having spent the previous week in the late British Agent’s garden outside the town. Khabir-ed-Dowleh, Deputy Governor, informed Mr. Grahame that the Lan Seyed had produced a letter or letters from Nizam-es-Sultaneh showing that the latter had himself called in the Seyed. On the 8th November the sons of the Kavam arrived, and on the 10th Isovember the Chief of the Kashgais withdrew. The situation has since been calmer. Robberies, however, continue to^ take place, several having been committed near the Residency. A telegram has just been leceived from His Majesty’s Consul that some of his servants have been brutally attacked by Kashgais. The country round Shiraz is also in a very disturbed condition, and the roads to Bushire and Ispahan are infested with robbers, those to the south being Kashgais. A servant of Lieutenant Black, who left Shiraz a few hours after his master to catch up the caravan, was robbed within sight of the caravan by a Kashgai horseman ol notes belonging to the Imperial Bank of Persia to the value of about 400/. On the 3rd November Captain Heinicke, a German merchant of Shiraz, was robbed within a quarter of an hour’s walk of the town. He was stripped of his clothes, and all he and his servant had with them was taken. The robbers then mounted their victims’ horses aud compelled their prisoners to walk ahead of them. Captain Heinicke received a blow and fell, whereupon the robbers, Avho are believed to have been Kashgais, made off, leaving him and bis servant and the horses. Captain Heinicke made his way to the house of the Acting Russian Consul-General, who telegraphed the facts to his Legation. His Majesty’s Consul, when informing this Legation of this incident, urged that measures should be taken for the protection of British subjects. A British merchant living in Shiraz was recently fired at with a revolver, and it appears to be quite unsafe for Europeans to go out after dusk. Yezd. The Governor has left the town, and the branch of the Imperial Bank has telegraphed that their guard of native soldiers has deserted, leaving them unprotected. Urgent representations are being made here on the subject. Kashan. A telegram has just been received from the signaller of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Kashan that a serious disturbance has broken out there, and that much firing has taken place near the telegraph office, from which he was unable to emerge on account of continued firing. This has also formed the subject of urgent representations to the Persian Government. Kcrrnanshah. On the 22nd October some firing took place in the neighbourhood of His Majesty s Consulate, several shots passing over it. Captain Haworth is of opinion that the shots were fired with a view to getting him to report that the town was in a disturbed state, and to prevent the return of Prince Seif-ed-Dowleh. In November Zahir-ed-Dowleh was appointed Governor. On the 25th October a Seyed assaulted an old Jew, a servant of the Israelite School. I he brother of the Imam Jumeh, who was passing, joined the Seyed, the soldiers of the Persian guard of the school coming to the rescue of the Jew. One of the soldiers was struck with a stone by a servant of the Imam Jumeh’s brother, and the servant in turn was beaten by the soldiers. M. Sagues had the man released, and wrote to the Imam Jumeh asking him to investigate the matter. Meanwhile a crowd entered the school, seized M. Sagues and dragged him to a mosque, threatening him with death. The Imam Jumeh rescued him at considerable personal risk, and got him safely into the house of the commander of the local troops. On the 29th M. Sagues, believing that the Jewish quarter was to be raided, took refuge at His Majesty’s Consulate, and remained there until Captain Haworth obtained a guarantee for his safety from the Karguzar. OBunder Abbas. All caravan routes to the interior were reported to be infested by highwaymen during October; consequently no caravans moved for some time. Later reports state that caravans are now being sent. Supplement to the Monthly Summary. Yezd. On the 14th November Bahrain Gushtask, a Parsee merchant, was shot at and seriously wounded by a Mussulman, who made his escape. Representations are being made to the Persian Government on the subject by His Majesty’s Legation. Shiraz. His Majesty’s Consul, telegraphing on the 3rd December, reported that lawlessness in Shiraz and throughout Pars was increasing; that the tribes were out of hand, and worse troubles were to be expected in the spring. The Prime Minister informed His .Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that nothing could be done until a Governor was sent. It is now reported that Ala-ed-Dowleh has finally agreed to go, his conditions having Been accepted in full. Mr. Grahame has expressed the opinion that if the tribesmen can be kept away from Shiraz the situation will improve, but that a strong Governor, with some armed force to back him, is required to put an end to the disorders. If Ala-ed-Dowleh actually goes, these requirements will be partly fulfilled. The Consular escort will remain at double its usual strength until the situation has improved. Meshed. Kuchan has been attacked by Turkomans, the Persian troops there being defeated. Bunder Abbas. Telegraphing on the 1st December, His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire reported that the British Consul at Bunder Abbas reported the situation there as serious in conse- sequence of the activity of the tribesmen. The Resident had arranged for His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing” to proceed there. Inclosure 2 in No. 84. Memorandum by Mr. Churchill on Proceedings of Persian National Assembly from November 9 to December 2, 1907. THE most noteworthy feature during the month under review was the State visit paid to the Assembly on the 12th November by the Shah. The Princes of the Royal House, including the Zil-es-Sultan, were present, as well as a representative gathering of officials and the clergy. Extraordinary precautions were taken to safeguard the Shah’s life. The ceremony lasted about half*an-hour, and after a preliminary exchange of compliments, in which the principal Mujtehed, Seyed Abdullah, acted as spokesman for the Assembly, the President laid a Koran before the Shah, as well^ as the oath prescribed by Article 38 of the Constitution of the 8th October, 1907, which the Shah made a pretence of taking. The President called for cheers for the Shah, which were loudly given. The Corps Diplomatique was not invited to attend the ceremony. This show of a reconciliation between the Shah and the Assembly brought about a temporary relaxation of the tension which existed before, but was soon followed by renewed activity on the part of the Shah’s agents, and the consequent indignation of the public. On the 17th November an important debate on the Budget took place. Ihe Finauce Committee of the House began by making a statement of the provisions they proposed to make for the expenses of the Shah’s Court, amounting to 500,000 tomans. Regarding the reductions made in the Pension List, amounting to 990,000 tomans [1072J G 281 a-Vear, they stated that 450,000 tomans represented deductions from or the entire suppression of, the pensions of thirteen persons, including those of the deceased Atabeg and Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Taki Zade made a speech dealing with the dissatisfac tion apparent on the part of the Shah and his courtiers at these arrangements, m which he intimated that if the Shah would not fall in with the Budget arrangements the House would be obliged to pay the Conrt^ officials itself and pay the fehah only the balance of about 30,000 tomans out of the C ivil List. . . . On the 14th November the question of the appointment of M. bizot as f inancial Adviser was again discussed in the presence of the Minister for Foreign Aflairs, who pressed the House to agree to the draft contract. After considerable debate the draft contract was agreed to, though no votes were taken. The general state of disorder in the country having become worse, representa tives of the amalgamated Committees addressed a statement of their demands to the House on the 19th November, in which they insisted on immediate steps being taken for the restoration of order, and asked the House^ to force the Princes and Nobles who had subscribed certain sums to the National PaiiK to pay their subscuptions in cash • -i p i . . , On the 21st November it was apparent by the attitude of the two principal Mujteheds that there was considerable dissatisfaction among the public as^ to the progress made by the Assembly. Seyed Mohammed said in the House, Wb heard much praise of a constitutional form of government. If this is the result there is no advantage in it. Is it not the duty of the Sovereign to prevent disorders ? Under present conditions life in this city is impossible.” t . On the 22nd November, the Prime Minister, the Ministers for War, Justice, and Commerce being present, there was some debate on the subject of ttm proposed army reform. No decision was arrived at, but the Minister for War promised to hand in his reform scheme in a week’s time. During the course of the debate some remarks were made on the subject of the independence of the Pussian Colonel of the Cossack Brigade. The President said that he was to blame for the previous day’s free fight which had occurred between his Cossacks and the native “ Silakhor ” regiment. On the 23rd November a number of Deputies were selected to form different Committees, including one for Foreign Affairs, the duties of which are to comprise superintendence over the Ministry for Foieign Affairs, and investigation into all foreign Treaties, contracts, and Concessions. The intrigues of the Shah’s agents, especially Saad-ed-Dowleh, having assumed a threatening character—-as evinced by the artificial agitation of persons whose pensions had been reduced, and the affray between Cossacks and the “ Silakhor ” regiment on the 21st November—a heated debate took place on the subject, in which Taki Zadd took a prominent part. The public was then asked to withdraw, and the debate con tinued with increased vigour. The Shah’s agents were denounced by name, including M. Chapchal, who is attached to the Shah in the capacity of Chamberlain. Saad-ed- Dowleh and Amir Behadur were also loudly denounced, and it was strongly urged by some Deputies that they should be expelled from the country. The Prime Minister, who was present, on being appealed to, admitted that he was aware of some unknown force at work against them. It was decided to hold a special private sitting the following day, at which the Cabinet Ministers should attend to discuss the situation. On the 27th November the Assembly held a private Session, but the Ministers were detained at the Palace. The President announced that the Shah desired to receive a deputation of the Members, and ten Members were chosen and proceeded to the Palace. On the 28th November, at a public sitting, the Shah’s written Address to the deputation of the previous day was read. His Majesty insisted on the necessity of entirely separating the executive duties of the Government from the legislative powers of the Assembly, and laid stress on the lamentable state of disorder into which the whole country had fallen. He finally urged the suppression of those local Com mittees which unduly interfered in Government affairs and were a cause of a disturb ance of the public peace, and announced that his Ministers had been given orders to effect their suppression. The Assembly, after carefully considering what reply they should give to the Shah’s Message, drew up, in consultation with the Chief Mujteheds, an answer thanking His Majesty for his gracious communication, assuring him that the Assembly did not desire to confound the duties of the Executive and Legislative Bodies, but desired to restrict its action to the drawing up of laws and to the super vision of their execution. Begarding the suppression of undesirable local Committees, they reminded the Shah of Article 21 of the Constitution of the 8th October, allowingthe formation of Committees, and promising to draw up Regulations for their governance. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL. No. 85. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 23.) (Extract.) Tehran, December 6, 1907. IT seems scarcely possible that the Government can sink to a lower degree of impotency than that it has now reached, but in spite of this it is a matter for surprise, considering the forces at work to discredit the new regime, that the general condition of the country, bad as it is, is not far worse. But I fear that this cannot be taken as a hopeful sign for the future. In a more highly organized country than Persia the paralysis of the central authority would surely have resulted in a far more serious and general demoralization; but here, where authority, central and provincial alike, is so largely personal, the disappearance of the former has not necessarily affected the latter, so that in the great majority of towns there is relative tranquillity, and but little appears on the surface to show the serious crisis through which the country is passing. _ , As I have already said, the influence of the Central Government is practically nil, and as instances of its incapacity to enforce obedience, even on officials under its hand, I may recall how Sepahdar has taken more than a fortnight on his journey to Astrabad, w here he is to take command against the Turkoman raiders ; how Mohtashem’- es-Sultaneh is loitering on his way to Urumia; and how Ala-ed-Dowleh, the Governor designate of Shiraz, declines to take up his appointment. Yet all these matters are urgent, and strong foreign pressure has been brought to bear on the Government to expedite them. . .. It is probably not yet realized in the less accessible parts of Persia how feeble the Government is, but when the knowledge becomes general there will be nothing left but the personal influence of the Governors to prevent local intrigues and feuds from bursting into activity, and producing the state of anarchy of which Shiraz is now an alarming example. Even as it is, the effect of the relaxation of central authority but too evident. The knowledge that no support can be given from Tehran deters every one from accepting the thankless task of attempting to restore order in provinces where disturb ances already exist or threaten to break out. Shiraz, Kerman, and Yezd lemnin without Governors; at Ispahan the Nayer-ed-Dowleh is the tool of the Aghas , at TJrumia the Governor has just been driven out of the town ; and at Tabreez Farman Farma, in spite of the fact that he has worked harmoniously with the local Assembly, is in danger of expulsion, and the town has been in the hands of the fedais foi a day or two. _ Nowhere is the state of affairs so bad as in Shiraz. As a last resort, the Governor called in the Lari tribesmen to enforce his authority, and then, realizing too late the helplessness of his position, abandoned his post, leaving the town to be the aiena of the struggle between the rival factions of Kavam-ul-Mulk and Motam-ed-Divan. Natural y the whole province is affected, and it is only too probable that Mr. Consul Giahames apprehensions will be realized, that when the tribesmen are returning to then summer quarters in the spring matters will be very much worse. ^ i t&gt; j a 11 a Further south the Baharloos are raiding the districts round Bunder Abbas, and an attack on the town itself is threatened. In Central Persia, Kashan was the scene of the 2nd instant of a lively fight between the retainers of the two local Notables, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s officials were for a time in serious danger , but no action seems to have been taken by the local authorities. At Ispahan the brothers Ao-ha Nejefi and Sheikh Norullah are organizing a boycott of European goods; and at Yezd, where a Parsee merchant was the victim of a murderous assault three weeks ao-o, the Acting Governor cannot even furnish the usual guard to the Imperial Bank. In the extreme north the Turkoman raids recall the stories of sixty years ago, but nothing effective is done to stop them. It would not be difficult to multiply instances, but I think I have cited enough to show that, wherever conditions are favourable to disorder and the local authority is weak, the Government is powerless to maintain order ; the point, moreover, receives confirmation from the fact that from Resht and Persian Kurdistan, both turbulent districts, but where there are competent G oGovernors, the reports are relatively favourable.^ The debility of the Government is no doubt largely due to weakness of character in its members especially Naser-u -Mul for from the standpoint of Western ideas the Cabinet probably represents all that is intellectually best in Persia. But allowance must be made for the enormous difficulties which confront it, of which the chief are an empty exchequer and e os i i y, open and secret, of the Shah and the reactionary group. . There can be no question whatever that the Government is practically without money. Naser-ul-Mulk told me the other day that virtually no revenue was coming m, except from the Customs, which had been extraordinarily productive, and 10 m he telegraphs and passport dues; and this is all absorbed by absolutely necessary calls* Ministers talk of plans for reform in the collection of the “ Mahat, and foi the imposition of new taxes, but naturally all this requires time, and meanwhile no money is forthcoming for the payment of troops to restore order. There is no piospect of obtaining an internal loan. It is to be feared that, even if money were forthcoming, the Government in present conditions would be incapable of employing it usefully. The second obstacle, i.e., the Shah’s hostility, is perhaps, in Persian eyes, an even more formidable difficulty than the lack of money. ^ Neither the Government nor the popular leaders can see any peaceable means of rendering him powerless for evil. It is a mystery where the Shah obtains money to carry on his intrigues. Most probably it comes from the reactionaries, whose conversion last September to the creed of the reformers was not very sincere, and possibly also from some of his own relatives. No. 86.

As to No. 3, the Zil-es-Sultan should merely be referred to terms on which protection was afforded him, and of which the essential condition is that he should remain lo)al to the Shah.

WITH reference to your telegram of the 23rd instant, the communication made hy myself and the Russian Minister to the Zil-es-Sultan was expressly to remind him of the conditions of our protection, i.e., his loyalty to the Shah. We also reminded him that the two Governments had agreed to recognize the Valiahd as successor.Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 25, 1907. IN general, your attitude in the Shah’s conflict with his people should be one of strict neutrality. You should not refuse the Shah admittance to His Majesty’s Legation if he seeks “ bast” there, unless such a course seemed likely merely to endanger the lives of others without any certainty of saving his own ; and it should be made perfectly clear that such asylum is given to him on the same terms as to any Persian who might apply for it in similar danger, as it is important that no one should have ground (or believing that the Shah has our support in his struggle against the Assembly. ^ We should also be ready to hand him over to the authorities, subject to our receiving adequate assurances that he would be permitted to leave Persia without any attempt being made on his life.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the last four weeks. The proceedings of the National Assembly have been included in the monthly summary. Inclosure in No. 91. Summary of Events in Persia for the last Four W eeks. Tehran. The National Assembly. IT will be remembered that the hostility of the Shah and his agents was keenly felt by the Assembly during November, when heated debates took place on the subject, as reported in the last summary of the proceedings of the Assembly. This crisis, which occurred on the 15th December, was precipitated by the insistence of the Assembly on the expulsion of Saad-ed-Dowleh and Amir Behadur Jang, the Shah s principal reactionary agents. The victory gained by the Assembly was_ m a great measure due to the armed support of the “ Enjumens,” or local Committees, the proceedings of the House, whose sittings have been uninterrupted, do not justify a separate Report. They were mainly devoted to the Shah’s attempted coup d The new Cabinet, which contains only three new members, i.e., Nizam-es-Sultan eh, m the place of Naser-ul-Mulk ; Zafar-es-Sultaneh, as Minister for War; and Kayem Makam, as Minister of Commerce and Customs, was eventually accepted by the House, [1072] ^ 4but at the sitting of the 31st December they were subjected to a most undignified cross-examination by the Deputies on the subject of recent events. The position of the House is probably stronger than ever at the present moment. N ew Cabinet. Finance Minister and President Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister of War Minister of Justice .. _ •.

On more than one occasion recently armed men have ^ endeavoured to force their way into the Russian Consulate-General, one of whom admitted that his purpose was to kill the Russian Consul-General. # -i i i In view of the generally disturbed situation at Tabreez and the Russian Oonsm- General’s request for further protection, the Russian Government have decided to send an extra guard of twenty-five Cossacks, and to keep a force of 400 men ready on the frontier. . , A telegram, received from Tehran the 2nd January, announces the arrival at Tabreez of twenty-five Cossacks, increasing the Russian guard to fifty men. Urumia. The revolutionaries having’ made the administration of the town impossible by arrogating to themselves judicial and administrative functions, the Governor on the 24th November appealed to the Governor-General and the labreez Assembly. Ho was authorized to eject the leader of the revolutionaries from Urumia. This was done on the 26th November, but the next day the Governor was himself compelled to leave the town, which remained without an Administration. No disorders have, however, yet occurred. Resht. Resht was thrown into a state of great excitement on the 18th December by reports that the whole of the National Assembly had been massacred and that Russian troops had crossed the frontier at Astara. Next day the Governor with the priests, Notables, and a crowd of people, assembled in the telegraph office, and remained there until, on the 23rd December, a telegram from Tehran announced that peace once more prevailed. A proposal to send 10,000 men fromGhilan to Tehran to support the Assembly resulted in some forty men being paraded in uniform. Meshed. The local Assembly have telegraphed to Tehran that, in view of the pressing necessity for funds in Khorassan for mobilizing troops, no revenue will in future be sent to the capital. Small additional bodies of troops were dispatched to Kuchan and Sabzewar, but they had no responsible leader, and desertions were common. Of 3,000 cartridges sent to Kuchan by parcels post 2,700 were lost on the way. On the 22nd December the popular party closed all Government offices, but allowed the British telegraph clerks to continue work. Next day the local Assembly took charge of the arsenal, and at our Consul-General’s request allowed the postal service to be resumed for foreign subjects. Both the popular and reactionary parties accepted our Consul-General’s advice to avoid bloodshed and maintain order. The city remained quiet and Europeans were respected. There was much anxiety for the Meshed Representatives at the Tehran Assembly.89 Ispahan. A representative of Agha Nejefi called on His Majesty’s Consul-General and denied that the Aghas had publicly ordered all native traders to close their accounts with Europeans. The denial was made in the presence of the Consular Mirza, who was also present when Agha Norullah issued his Decree from the pulpit. The fact remains that native traders dare not deal freely with Europeans as before. Yezd. The post from Yezd to Kerman was robbed on the 22nd November. The robbers are stated to have been Kashgai. All the soldiers at Yezd excepting four have deserted and returned to Kerman. The Imperial Bank of Persia was able to get two of the four remaining men, but the British telegraph office remains without a guard. The town remains quiet in spite of there being no Governor. Kerman. His Majesty’s Consul telegraphed in the last week in December that the Nazim and Haji Naibliad concocted a plot against the British residents in Kerman. He added that they were ruling the town by fear, and that their continued ascendency was damaging to our prestige. They had control of all offices, and Major Ducat could not even post letters. On the 1st January Major Ducat, in answer for a request for details of the plot, telegraphed that on receipt of the Shah’s telegram of the 16th December announcing his coup d'Etat, the Nazim called on the Consulate Attache and asked whether the British Government would intervene. When told that thev 'would not, he appeared distressed and talked of suicide. Next day numbers of old illuminated Bible texts were distributed in the bazaar in Major Ducat’s name, reports were spread that British troops had already landed and were going to take Kerman and force Christianity on the people, and that Major Ducat was issuing papers of protection. A mollah was put up to preach against the Missionary Society. On the 23rd December a midnight meeting was held at which the question of an ^attack on British subjects was discussed. The plot was organized by the Nazim, Haji Naib, and Seyed Shahab. Shiraz. The situation continued disturbed during the last days of November and most of December. There was a good deal of firing, and the number of street assaults and robberies increased. Full particulars have now been received as to the assault on Mr. Grahame’s servant, reported in last summary. On the 10th December the manager of the Imperial Bank was deliberately fired upon, but fortunately not hit. Negotiations between the two factions have several times taken place, but without result. Ihe Khabir-ed-Dowleh, nominally Deputy Governor of Ears, is without power or resources; such authority as exists lies in the hands of the Kavam’s sons. Sahib Ekhtiar has been appointed Governor-General, and left jfehran on the 30th December foi his post. Latest reports state that the situation is much calmer. Muleteers report that riflemen on the Bushire road take toll from all caravans. A caravan of Messrs. Ziegler’s was held up by riflemen near Chenar Bahdar, and almost everything was taken. The stolen goods include a box of bar silver, a gun, and over 120Z. worth of other property. Reports continue to be received of the damage done by tribesmen ; in one case a group of villages is said to have been razed to the ground. The Baharloo tribesmen are said to be quite out of hand. There is a consensus of opinion that in the spring there will be considerable tribal trouble. Ahwaz. Lieutenant Wilson and twenty men, detailed as a guard for the oil works at Batwand and Mamatain, reached Ahwaz during December. The second officer, Lieutenant Ranking, is now on his way there. . j i • Telegraphic communication between Ahwaz and Borazjoon was restored early in December and subsequently again broken.Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received January 20, 1908.) Tehran, December 31, 1907. (EX WHEN I saw Nasr-ul-Mulk on the 13th Instant, he -id ^t the relations of the Government with the Shah were again giving him some anxiety, but lie gave me no Parliament buildino-s. where speeche! of an inflammatory character were dehvered by Malek-ul-Mutekallfmin and other popular orators flenouncing the bhah and de “ a ^mg the removal and expulsion of Amir Bahadur Jang and Saad-ed-Uowleh »peecnes 2d— *- 4*») ™i«'* w-d-srste: raS ttSTStt ussf !,«!»«»».»». *** ready to attack the Assembly, and that the popular party were meditating taking “ bast ” en masse at the Legation. Inquiry showed at once that the first par t of this information was correct, and I therefore caused the Legation gates to be closed, and posted a gholam at each with orders that I was to be called if any attempt were made to enter the compound. No movement of the kind was, however, made. The Med jliss sat all the morning, and an attempt was made to induce Ala-ed-Dowleh and Zil-es-Sultan, who both attended the sitting, to convey a message from the House to the Shah. Both, however, declined, the latter suggesting with grim humour that NfliVi-ps-Sultanch mifflit be willing to undertake the mission, , Towards 3 o’clock Ala-ed-Dowleb, on a summons from the Shah went to the Palace, where he was at once hurried off under escort and condemned, with his brother Mum- ed-Dowleh to exile at Kerbela. At the Palace, where Colonel Liakhoff and another officer of the Cossack Brigade were present with a detachment of their troops, there was the wildest excitement, and the court-yards were crowded with armed men. The treatment of Ala-ed-Dowleh produced a profound sensation at the Assembly, where towards 5 o’clock, it was decided that the deputation, whose attendance the Shah had required for the next morning, should go at once to the Palace, while the House would remain sitting until they returned. The deputation, however, never left, and the Members, on learning presumably of Nasr-ul-Mulk s arrest, dispersed hastily to Meantime the Shah had summoned the Ministers to the Palace, and had placed Nasr-ul-Mulk, the first arrival, under arrest. The news of the coup was brought me about 6’SO by his relative, Iftikher-ut-Tujjar, and a servant who had accompanied Nasr-ul-Mulk to the Palace, and who asserted that as he was led away his master had whispered, “ Let the British Legation know I am to be killed by 10 o’clock.’ Both were labouring under deep emotion, and begged that I would send at once to the Pala-e to save Nasr-ul-Mulk’s life. Knowing the state of mind m which the Shah had been^a few hours previously, the Nasr-ul-Mulk seemed to be in very real danger, and I at once sent Mr. Churchill to the Palace to obtain assurances for his life, and to say that if they were not given at once I should come myself to demand them. I informed the Prussian Minister of the steps I was taking. On reaching the Palace Mr. Churchill found that Nasr-ul-Mulk was confined in one room, while the rest of the Cabinet was assembled in another, practically under arrest also, in charge of Amir Bahadur Jang. The announcement of Mr. Churchill’s mission came as a great relief to the Ministers, but was received with disquiet by their warders. After some'little delay he was conducted to the Shah, whom he found walking up and down one of the courts of the Palace. His Majesty was in the highest spirits. He declared, of course, that he had no intention of injuring Nasr-ul-Mulk, who was free to depart wherever he pleased, or any of the Ministers, and kept repeating, “ They are frightened; they are frightened.” Mr. Churchill returned to the room where the Ministers were sitting, and Nasr-ul-Mulk appeared shortly after. Subsequently a “ destkhat ” (autograph Rescript; of the Shah was brought stating that His Majesty had no complaint against Nasr-ul-Mulk, and that, his resignation as Minister being accepted, he was free to go where he pleased. The whole body of Ministers then left the Palace, and Mr. Churchill sent a gholam to accompany Nasr-ul-Mulk to his house, which he reached about 7‘30. ... • • i Whether Nasr-ul-Mulk was in imminent danger or not it is difficult to say. fromwhat Mr. Churchill saw at the Palace there is no doubt that both he and the Ministers were badly scared, and Nasr-ul-Mulk’s own apprehensions may be gauged from his requesting me to send Dr. Neligan with him as far as Pesht, nominally in medical attendance, but really, as had been done when Dr. Scully accompanied the late Atabeg to Kum in 1897, to protect him. This, I said, I was unable to do for the moment, but I allowed the head gholam to spend the night at Nasr-ul-Mulk’s house, and sent two gholams to accompany him to Enzeli, whither his Excellency started at sunrise on Monday morning. A good many attempts were made by the local Anjumans at Kazvin and Pesht to persuade Nasr-nl-Mulk to return to Tehran, but he adhered to his determination to go to Europe, and was to leave Enzeli for Baku and Petrovsk on the 24 th. M. Rabino had authorized one of the gholams to accompany his Excellency as far as Baku. He reached Vienna on the 30th, and proposes to go to England. To return to events in Tehran, there is little doubt but that on Sunday night the Shah had the game in his own hands. There were no Ministers; the Assembly, cowed by the arrest of Ala-ed-Dowleh and Nasr-ul-Mulk, had dispersed ; the political Committees—its only real support—had shown no s'gn of life, and the Shah’s forces terrorized the town. His Majesty had but to occupy the Baharistan and mosque, and seize a few of the popular leaders, and the coup d’Etat was complete. But either from over-confidence, or more probably because his nerve failed—and no doubt the intervention of His Majesty’s Legation on behalf of Nasr-ul-Mulk had had its effect—the Shah made no move. Breathing space was thus given to the popular party, and when, to the general surprise, the Assembly met as usual the following morning, the political Committees had had time to regain their courage. In the course of the day the Baharistan garden and the courts of the Sepahsalar Mosque, which adjoins it, filled with people, the roofs of both buildings and other coigns of vantage were slowly occupied by armed members of the Anjumans, and it was stated that by the evening there were as many as 3,000 men with rifles ready to defend the Medjliss. I was twice approached during the day by the friends of the Assembly to ascertain whether the Legation would not in some way or other give assistance fo the cause of reform, but gave it clearly to be understood that I would do nothing of the kind, and would do all in my power to prevent the Legation from being forced into taking any part whatever in the struggle. My visitors both said that their party would not take the offensive, but would defend itself, if attacked, to the last. The night passed quietly, though, as during the past few nights, a few shots were fired in and about Cannon Square. A small number of armed men remained on guard over the Assembly, and Cossacks patrolled the streets. On Tuesday morning, the 17th instant, a number of men brought in from the Shah’s stud farm near Veramin were found to have occupied the west end of Cannon Square. Tents were pitched for them, food and spirits were served out, and a party of Cossacks with guns took up a position beside them. Towards midday some of the roughs left, but in the evening their numbers again increased, and more tents appeared. During the day they murdered two persons and assaulted a few others. In the morning I was asked by some of the leading mollahs and clergy to send a series of telegrams for them over the British wires, as the Shah had closed the Persian offices. The telegrams were addressed to the Ulema of all the greater towns of Persia, and of Kerbela and Nejef, describing the situation here. I declined to do so, as did also Mr. Barker, Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. A letter from the Assembly was brought to the Legation and to the other foreign missions recalling the efforts of the people to free themselves from the tyranny of despotism, and calling us to witness to the righteousness of their cause, and asking for sympathy in their struggle for freedom. The Assembly sat all the morning debating as to the demands to be made to the Shah, and in the afternoon a deputation was selected to wait on His Majesty and require him to agree to the following :— 1. Exile of Saad-ed-Dowleh. 2. Amir Behadur Jang to be placed under the orders of the Ministry of War. 3. The Cossack Brigade also to be under that Department. 4. The Shah to take an oath before the Assembly to observe the Constitution. 5. Punishment of the men who had fired on the Assembly. 6. Formation of a national guard of 200 men for the protection of the Assembly.In the afternoon, on my way to the Russian Legation, I passect in front of the Medjliss, and found only a few hundred people about it, and a small number ° “ e with rifles on the walls and roofs of the surrounding buildings. Some ot the s ops the ad oining streets were open, and as the Veramin party m Cannon Square was then at ite lowesf numbers, the situation seemed to be improving, especially as the demands formulated by the Mediliss were not unreasonable. . , , , ,, The Shah’s reply was of the usual temporizing character, but he conceded the return of Ala-ed-Dowleh and Nasr-ul-Mulk, which had been previously demanded. The sitting of the Assembly continued, and the crowd round the budding increased towards eveninc till it was estimated that there were some 6,000 to 7,000 armed men present. Meanwhile the Court party had been straining every resource to increase their strength, and at one time there were as much as 1,500 men in t m Gannon Square. The ^ acei ® of the popular party were clearly apprehensive for their personal safety, and few ot them slept in their own houses. The following day the situation remained practically unchanged while pourparlers were in progress between the Palace and the Parliament, though it was clear that the Shah’s demand for the expulsion ot four or five of the most prominent Deputies from the Assembly could never be accepted. j j xr • On Thursday the popular leaders, feeling their position secure, persuaded 'their adherents to leave the Baharistan as a proof that they were prepared to trust the Shah’s assurances that he had no hostile intentions against the Medjhss. The gardens of the mosque adjoining it were, however, still occupied, and two demonstrations vere made by the Cannon Square party intended to provoke a conflict. f n ^he evening telegrams of support to the popular cause were received from Besht, Kazvm, and Tahreez, while the Enjumen of the latter town announced that the Shah should be deposed. On Friday the tents of the hooligans, which had been removed the previous evening, reappeared. Further telegrams menacing the Shah with deposition or death came in from the provincial Anjumans, and by the evening, though both parties had remained quiescent all day, and a Ministry been formed, though not actually appointed, the general situation seemed to be as strained as ever. In the course of the evening I received a visit from Saad-ed-Dowleh’s nephew, Mahmoud Khan, asking me to send a letter to the Shah to the effect that Saad-ed-Dowleh was under British protection. The request was made on the ground that in 1906, when Saad-ed-Dowleh was in “bast” at the British Yice-Consulate at Yezd, His Majestys Legation had obtained an assurance from the late Shah’s Government for his life. I declined to accede to the request. On the following day, the 21st instant, although it was said that the Shah was about to accept all the Assembly’s demands, and that a new Ministry had been formed, there was little, if any, improvement in the situation. The people were discontented at the composition of the Cabinet, and mistrusted the Shah’s sincerity, and it was evident that the pretended reconciliation did not reassure them. At the Palace signs of depression were evident. The Shah, disturbed by the evidence of the Zil-es-Sultan’s alliance with the Constitutionalists, suddenly sent an order to His Imperial Highness to leave the country. The Zil at once sent his son, Bahrain Mirza, to the Legation to invoke its protection, but as I was aware that the Zil had unquestionably been furnishing arms, and probably money also, to the Anjumans, and that his sons had shown themselves armed at the Baharistan, I gave him rather a cool reception, suggesting that his father could reassure himself by reading the various letters in which he had been assured of British assistance in case of need. On Sunday at 11 o’clock, as prearranged, M. de Hartwig and I had an audience of the Shah. M. de Hartwig set forth the situation lucidly and concisely, and asked His Imperial Majesty to give assurances that he had no hostile designs towards the Constitution. In reply the Shah said that he had never entertained any hostility to the Parliament, and asked how that could be possible seeing that he himself had signed it and had brought it to his father to sign. He desired only to suppress those Anjumans which abused and vilified himself and his family and were openly seditious. I replied that His Majesty’s assurances that he harboured no hostile intentions against the Assembly, and would work with it in future for the good of the country, afforded us the greatest satisfaction. The audience lasted less than a quarter of an hour. At 3 o’clock M. de Hartwig and I called on the Zil. The object of our visit was explained only with many interruptions on the part of His Imperial Highness. Meantime the general situation had become more threatening. The Tabreez Anjuman had succeeded in circulating throughout Persia the threat of deposing the Shah, and the larger cities, where the idea of constitutional government has taken03 root, appeared to be greatly excited. Telegrams promising armed support against tbe Shah had been received from Shiraz, Ispahan, Resht, Kazvin, Kerman, and Meshed, and signs of sympathy had come in from other quarters. In Tehran itself, despite unmistakable signs that the Shah must yield, as he did late in the afternoon, the excitement against His Majesty was, if anything, more marked. There was general discontent at the composition of the new Cabinet, which included two or three members of dubious loyalty to the Constitution, and the clamour for the execution of the leaders of the roughs was increasing. The crowds at the Baharistan and mosque were, if anything, larger, although the Cannon Square was now clear. There was less firing that evening than in any night since the 14th. On Tuesday morning the town wore its usual peaceful appearance, except that the Assembly building and mosque were still crowded and the bazaars closed, and the Assembly did its best to persuade the Enjumens to disperse. By midday, however, it became clear that the popular party, feeling that they had the upper hand, desired to push their advantage home. Threats of vengeance on their wives and families, if they remained faithful, were freely used towards the men of the Shah’s Tabreez body guard ; the loyalty of the Cossack Brigade was undermined, and the deposition and assassination of the Shah were openly advocated. At the Palace there was the utmost depression ; the Shah himself was in terror of his life, and his adherents^ and servants were deserting him. On every hand one heard it said that His Majesty would not survive for a week. In the afternoon I called on the Russian Minister, and we discussed the situation at great length. We felt that for the moment the important point was to keep the Shah on the throne, as the only chance of preventing Persia from falling still deeper into the slough of anarchy appeared to be in maintaining him. Should he be removed, there would be the prospect of a long Regency, and all disinterested Persians are agreed in looking on a Council of Regency as being as unworkable as^ would be a Republic. Owing to personal jealousies and interested^motives, an experiment of the kind would result in hopeless and helpless confusion, with a Central Oovernment e\en feebler than at present. If, then, constitutional government is to have a fair trial, the best chance of success would be under a Shah who has already had his lesson severely taught to him. . The essential thing, therefore, for the moment was the preservation of the Shah. But we could do nothing here. To attempt to protect the Palace with the handful of men attached to the two Legations would have been worse than folly. Moreover, so long as there were no Ministers, and so long as the Assembly and the Administration, such as it was, were completely dominated by the then frankly revolutionary Com mittees, there was no point at which to exercise influence. The same evening Saad-ed-Dowleh left the Palace where he had been for the past three or four days, and took “ bast” at the Dutch Legation. On Christmas and the two following days there was a progressive detente, although the crowds about the Assembly House and mosque did not diminish. I he Shah has taken no steps to fulfil his promise that the men who fired on the Baharistan on the 16th, and committed excesses in the town, should be punished, nor has he attended the Assembly to take his solemn oath on the Koran. On Friday, the 27th, a party of mollahs, headed by Sheikh Fazlullah, who has since been excommunicated by the Great Mujteheds at Kerbela, and Seyecl Ah Yezdi, who have been the most prominent propagandists of tbe Shah s cause, took refuge in the Masjid Marvi on the east of the Palace, and with them were some of the roughs whose punishment was one of the conditions of the pact made with the Shah. A few of the mollahs tried to take “ bast” in the Russian Legation on Saturday night, but were turned away, and on Sunday a similar attempt was made at the Turkish Embassy, and a considerable number of them kept hanging about there till the 31st. t , , The Shah has remained in the seclusion of the Anderoon smee Christmas day, and has pleaded indisposition as an excuse for twice declining to receive the Dutch Minister, who asked an audience of His Majesty in connection with Saad-ed-Dow leh s piesence at the Netherland Legation. , n n ^ It has been difficult to find a method of conveying the k_hahs guarantee m a manner agreeable to the susceptibilities of the Assembly. However, on Inday Mushir- ed-Dowleh furnished M. de Hartwig with a rough draft of a declaration which we midit each communicate to the President of the Assembly, and taking this as the basis we prepared a letter in French, which we submitted to his Excellency on Sunday.

IL resulte d’un echange de vues qui s’est etabli entre le Ministre de Itussie et le Charge d’Affaires d’Angleterre en vue d’examiner les moyens it mettre en oeuvre pour remedier au danger de la situation presente, que : 1. Une demarche collective aupres de Sa Majeste s’impose pour eu obtenir des assurances qu’aucun projet n’existe dans son esprit pouvant amener Tabolition du rbgime constitutionnel, et qu’elle entend collaborer avec le Parlement au bien du pays; 2. Que ces assurances etant obtenues, il y aura lieu d’en informer le Parlement pour retablir des relations de commune confiance entre la Courorme et la Chambre. Le Parlement, ayant obtenu des assurances, pourra s’affranchir de la tutelle des andjoumans revolutionnaires qui, n’ayant aucune responsabilite dans Taction gouveroe- mentale, n’hesitent pas a entrainer le pays vers les pires dangers. La preuve en a et6 faite avant-hier encore par la notification que le Comite de Tauris a ose faire de la decheynce de Sa Majeste; 3. Que, d’autre part, en face de Tattitude prise depuis quelque temps par le Prince Zil-es-Sultan, qui n’a pas hesite a profiler de la situation pour se mettre derriere les agitateurs et po^er sa candidature eventuelle au trone, il y a lieu egalement de donner un avertissement severe a ce personnage. Les Representants de Russie et d’Angleterre decident de se rendre pres de Zil-es- Sultan comme corollaire a la demarche pres du Schah, et de lui faire comprendre le danger de son attitude, qui est contraire aux assurances qu’il avait donnees maintes fois au moment ou il invoqua la protection des deux Legations. Comme les Gouvernements Russe et Anglais out entendu assurer la succession normale de la famille regnante actuelle, ils ne sauraient admettre la conduite du Prince Zil -es-Sultan, et se reservent de lui en faire ressortir tons les dangers. (Translation.) AF TER an exchange of views as to the measures which should be adopted to remove the dangers of the present situation, the Russian Minister and the British . Charge d’Affaires have arrived at the following conclusions 1. That joint representations should be made to His Majesty with the view to obtaining from him assurances that he is contemplating no scheme which might involve the abolition of the constitutional regime, and that he intends to work with the Parliament for the country’s welfare. 2. That having obtained these assurances. Parliament should be informed thereof, in order that relations based on mutual confidence may be established between the Crown and the Chamber. Parliament, on receipt of these assurances, will be able to free itself from the tutelage of the revolutionary Anjumans, which, having no responsibility for the actions of the Government, do not hesitate to lead the country into the gravest dangers. Proof of this was again given the day before yesterday, when the Tabreez Committee dared to announce that His Majesty had been deposed. 3. That, on the other hand, a serious warning should be given to the Prince Zil-es- ■ Sultan, in view of the attitude which he has recently adopted and the fact that he has not hesitated to take advantage of the situation to instigate the agitators and to advance his eventual candidature for the throne. 1 he Repiesentatives of Russia and Great Britain have decided, in addition to their representations to the Shah, to visit the Zil-es-Sultan and to point out to him the danger of his attitude, which is contrary to the repeated assurances given by him • when he invoked the protection of the two Legations. As the Russian and British Governments have agreed to ensure the normal95 Succession of the present reigning family, they are unable. to countenance the conduct of the Prince Zil-es-Sultan, and reserve to themselves to place before him the full extent of the danger of his proceedings.

Yeuillez, &amp;c. (Signe) CHARLES M. MARLING. (Translation.) M le President, Tehran, December 30, 1907. I HAVE just received the letter from the National Assembly of the 11th Zil-Kade concerning the events of the last few days. I have learnt with the greatest interest the good intentions of the National Assembly. All who cherish for Persia profound and sincere feelings of sympathy, and more especially the British Legation which entertains the most lively wishes for that country’s welfare and prosperity, have looked forward with impatience to the termination of disorders, and, animated with the same humane feelings, have endeavoured to calm the regrettable state of affairs of the last few days ; they desired accordingly to point out to His Majesty the great evil which would result from a prolongation of so disquieting a situation. I did not fail therefore to assure myself in a friendly way that His Majesty entertained for Parliament feelings which are in complete harmony with the prosperity which we desire the country should enjoy. In words addressed to me personally His Majesty has graciously informed me of his firm resolution to act in conformity with the principles of the constitution, and in concert with the National Assembly, in respecting the fundamental laws. I for my part, am quite convinced that His Majesty will in future allow no step to be taken which would be in opposition to the oath and the promise given to the National Assembly. _ _ . I offer my most cordial congratulations to Parliament on the occasion of the agreement which has been concluded. ° In asking your Excellency to be so good as to bring the above to the knowledgeof the members of the honourable National Assembly, I think that I am. justified in expressing my conviction that they will see therein fresh proof of the feelings of fiiend- ship and profound sympathy which unite Great Britain and Persia. Accept, &amp;c. (Signed) CHABLES M. MARLING. No. 93. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.— {Received January 20.) gj r Tehran, January 2, 1908. ALTHOUGH Tehran is now relatively quiet, and the provinces have been much less affected than might reasonably ha.ve been apprehended by the knowledge of what was happening at the capital, I fear that relief is only temporary, and that Persia is drifting nearer and nearer to complete anarchy. The struggle between the Shah and his people has resulted in a complete victory for the latter, but I am not sanguine that the prospects of the establishment of constitutional government on a durable basis have been much improved thereby. lor the moment, indeed, the Shah has been completely cowed, and is now retired into the Anderoon. The popular party, excited by the accounts given by the local Tabreez Committee of His Majesty’s duplicity and incapacity while Governor of Azerbaijan, has the profoundest mistrust and hatred for him, and there is every reason to fear that should the public again feel convinced that he is attempting to thwart the Assembly, he will be overwhelmed by a storm of rage and indignation and driven from the throne, if, indeed, he escaped with his life. As I have ventured to observe in another despatch, the one chance of constitutional government appears to be in retaining Mohammed Ali on the throne, but it is almost too much to hope that he will be able to refrain from the interference that is so much resented. On the other hand, the Assembly and its supporters are not free from blame. The Assembly has, to some extent, owing no doubt to the mischievous interference of the Enjumens, shown no aptitude whatever for its proper functions, and I have heard it said by an observant Persian that, had the Shah postponed his attempted coup d'Etat for a few months, public opinion, realizing that the experiment of repre sentative government was premature, would have demanded the dissolution of Parliament. But it is also ignorant and corrupt. There is probably only a small minority of the Assembly who are sincere in wishing for reform, or have anything but a vague idea of what it would imply; and though some of these, such as Taki Zade, carry great weight in the Assembly, the ignorant majority of Deputies are often swayed by five or six powerful and self-interested Members who really guide the work of the House. Of the corruption, a single instance will suffice. Large sums have been collected, mostly by indirect menace from those suspected of reactionary leanings, for the foundation of the National Bank, and lodged with one of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. Of this money, which may have amounted to as much as 50.000/., no account has been given. It may have been expended in payments of wages and salaries ; it is, however, currently said to have been quietly absorbed by the Members of the Assembly and Enjumens. Should this be true, with dishonesty such as this, and with self-interest and mutual distrust rampant, there is not much to be hoped for from the Assembly as it now exists. Nor is it likely, also, that a new election would result in the return of better Members. The fact is that Persia is not yet, and will not for a couple of generations to come be, fit for representative institutions. The Ministers, again, appear quite unequal to the task laid on them. In spite of the impctency to which the Shah has been reduced, they are almost in as great dread of him as in the palmy days of absolutism, and what between this traditional respect of the Sovereign and fear of offending the Medjliss and Enjumens, the executive power is practically paralyzed. Persia stands in need of a strong man to prevent her from falling to pieces from her own inherent weaknesses ; but, so far, no such man has been found, and it seems impossible for her to escape that fate. It may be that the popular leaders will recognize that in the maintenance of the present Shah lies the best hope for the existing regime, and in that case the worst that will happen will be a period of general but relatively peaceful anarchy, not much worse than has existed for the past few months. On the other hand, it seems moreprobable that some imprudent action of the Shah will again rouse the popular fury against him, and that His Majesty will be driven from the throne. There is, however, one factor which makes it permissible to hope that if disorder ensues it will not be violent or of long duration, viz., the pacific, not to say timorous, character of the people; and how strong this is may be gauged from the fact that, despite all the excitement of the recent crisis, no actual collision took place between the rival parties. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHA.BLES M. MAELING. No. 94. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 20.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, January 15, 1908. THE Emperor held the customary reception at Tsarskoe Selo yesterday, on which occasion the Diplomatic Body present their congratulations on the New Year. I took the opportunity to mention to His Majesty that His Majesty’s Government were much gratified by the cordial co-operation which M. Isvolsky had afforded during the crisis in Persia, and that it had been of great advantage that the two Governments had been enabled to act so harmoniously together. I thought that you would wish me to bear this testimony to the frank and loyal attitude which M, Isvolsky has adopted during recent events in Persia. His Majesty said that he had been particularly pleased with the amiable manner in which both Governments had acted together, and he remarked that it was a source of satisfaction to him that the two Bepresentatives at Tehran had also worked cordially together. He attached great importance to the Agents of both countries in Persia following the same course which had been agreed upon between their respective Governments. His Majesty added that at one time it seemed possible that the Zil-es-Sultan was endeavouring to set himself up as a pretender to the throne, but he hoped that the words of warning which had been addressed to him by the British and Russian Representatives had damped his ardour and had checked any intrigues which he might have had in contemplation. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NIOOLSON. No. 95. Sir A. Nicohon to Sir Edward. Grey.—(Received January 20.) g| r St. Petersburgh, January 16, 1908. M. ISVOLSKY informed me to-day that, as a simple measure of^ precaution, it had been considered advisable to make a slight redistribution of the forces near the Persian frontier, but he could tell me that in the whole of the rayon of Julfa only 600 Cossacks had been stationed, so that I could see that the measures which had been taken were modest. In the event of any very serious trouble occurring at Tabreez, which endangered the lives of Russian subjects, these 600 Cossacks would be near at hand to afford assistance and protection. The Persian Government, through their Charge d’Affaires here, had made representations on the subject, and had evidently received exaggerated reports as to what had taken place. He had told the Charge d’Affaires that though he did not feel called upon to give any explanations as to what the Russian authorities might consider fit to do within their own frontiers, he would give him a true account of the measuies which had been adopted. M. Isvolsky added that the strictest orders had been given to the officers in command on no account to cross the frontier without receiving explicit instructions to that effect from head-quarters.

There is every indication that state of insecurity in Shiraz will last for some time, and reports from His Majesty’s Consul show that disorders are likely to recur this spring. Do His Majesty’s Government propose to retain indefinitely, or at least until situation improves, the sowars who should have been relieved last November ? I venture to urge advisability of making arrangements of a more permanent character. No. 98. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 17.) Sir, Tehran, January 29, 1908. IN the early days of the month, though externally the town was quiet enough, it seemed as though another crisis might occur. The Shah, after a few days’ comparative inactivity, recommenced his campaign against the Assembly. By his influence, exercised through two of the great ecclesiastics, the party at the Masjid-i-Mervi had been allowed to escape ; reinforcements for the body-guard were being brought into Tehran by driblets ; the Parsees were terrorized by the murder of a prominent member of their community for having assisted the popular cause with money and arms ; an attack on Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s house, ascribed to burglars, was popularly believed to have been an attempt organized from the Palace on the life of the Minister, for whom the Shah is known to entertain a particular dislike. On the 10th instant I had a long conversation with Nizam-es-Saltaneh, the new Premier, in which, after explaining to his Excellency that the recent Anglo-Russian Agreement was in no way inimical to Persia, but, on the contrary, left her free to develop unhampered by the distracting rivalry of the two Powers, 1 adverted to the existing situation, and asked his Excellency if he could suggest any means by which I could help to remove the distrust felt universally of the Shah. Nizam-es-Saltaneh replied that the only thing was to give the Shah good advice and persuade him to follow it. I said I would see what I could do, and then adverted to the murder of Fereidoun, and received a promise from the Premier that every effort would be made to punish the assassins. I was unable to see the Russian Minister the following day, but, in reply to a note saying I proposed to call on Sunday, 1 received one from M. de Hartwig late in the evening letting me know that he was to see the Shah the next morning for the purpose of impressing on His Majesty the absolute need of good relations with the Assembly. I happened to meet M. de Hartwig soon after he had left the Palace, and he told me he had spoken to the Shah in the most serious manner, and believed that he had produced some impression. I told him of my conversation with Nizam-es-Saltaneh, that I had wished to consult him (M. de Hartwig) before taking any such step as the Premier had hinted atand I added that, as he had already taken action, the best thing would be for me to back it up with even stronger representations. I proposed to point out to His Majesty that the strength of the movement in favour of constitutional reform was too strong for him to overcome, that to resist it would result in the gravest danger to himself, and that if he sincerely desired to act as a constitutional Sovereign he must leave the administration of the affairs of the country to his responsible Ministers. M. de Hartwig expressed his entire concurrence. The same afternoon I went to arrange with Mushir ed-Dowleh for a private audience, and early the following morning received a note from him that the Shah would receive me the next morning, the 14th January, at 11 A.M. In the meantime the Shah had received very serious warning from another quarter. On the previous day he had been waited on by the Head of the Kajar tribe, a man who, having never meddled with politics in Persia, has a reputation for absolute disinterest and is universally respected, and by his brother, Shoa-es-Saltaneh. According to the accounts of the interview which have reached me, and which I believe to be substantially correct, Azad-ul-Mulk, using the patriarchal authority inherent in the head of a tribe, spoke with the utmost freedom. He said that he knew, as did every other Persian, that the Shah alone was responsible for the lamentable state of the country, and that he, as Chief of the Imperial tribe, had come to inform His Majesty that, if he did not mend his ways, the Kajars themselves would decree his deposition and proclaim the Yaliahd as Shah in his stead. The Shah, in reply, promised to receive a deputation from the Assembly, and to satisfy them of the sincerity of his amicable intentions. It is certain that His Majesty made every profession of loyal observance of his oaths to respect the Constitution, and that the deputation had to retire professedly satisfied. He appears, however, to have extracted in exchange a promise from the deputation to consider the increase of the Civil List. At my audience on the following day, I told His Majesty that, while after the assurances he had given to the Russian Minister and myself, I could not but believe in the sincerity of his own intentions, I could not help thinking that there were persons in his entourage who, in the belief that it was His Majesty’s wish, were trying to oppose the introduction of constitutional reform. History showed that it was impossible to stem the flood of a nation’s will, and that the attempt to do so was disastrous. The people were very mistrustful, even hostile, and unless His Majesty could succeed in removing their suspicions his position would become one of the gravest peril. The best means of doing so would be to free himself of all appearance of being guided by the persons I had alluded to, and to refrain from direct interference in the Government, leaving the administration in the hands of the responsible Ministers. The Shah replied that he had no quarrel with constitutional government, but only with the present Assembly, which itself was continually guilty of unconstitutional acts. There were in it certain persons whose influence was wholly bad, and, if they could be got rid of, confidence would be restored. It was not true, as was asserted, that he thwarted the Ministers ; he was by no means contented with the present Cabinet, of which he could only trust one Member, the Premier, Nizam-es-Saltaneh ; but he did nothing to impede their work. I replied that if there were undesirable Deputies in the Parliament, that was an ill which would remedy itself, but that to attempt to remove them arbitrarily would be a most dangerous expedient. I could not conceal from His Majesty that, in my opinion and in that of other foreign Representatives, his position was already very precarious. If he would take some overt steps to convince the nation that he desired to work cordially with them, he would meet with instant response; but if he persisted in his present attitude, the consequences might bring disaster to himself. I cannot say that I was able to detect from the Shah’s manner that I had produced much impression on him, but I have since been told that it had the effect of driving home the advice and warnings given him by Azad-ul-Mulk and the Russian Minister, the more so that His Majesty’s Legation had so scrupulously abstained from isolated action. ^ _ • Be this as it may, the Shah has permitted the arrest of Sani Hazret and Mukfadir- i-Nizam, the leaders of his roughs during the crisis of December, as also that of twu servants of Mujellal-es-Sultan, who are known to have been concerned in the murder of the Parsee banker, Fereidoun ; but he still openly protects their master, who is believed to have been the prime mover in the crime, and has directed his wrath upon the Minister of War, Zafar-es-Saltaneh, who caused the arrests to be made. Since then, public attention has, been directed chiefly to the inquiry, held at the [1072] H 2Ministry of Justice, in the case of Sani Hazret and Muktadir-i-Nizam, and into the murder of Fereidoun. It is said that evidence has come to light showing the existence of a plot, in which Mujellal-es-Sultan was the chief agent, lor the assassination oi eight or ten of the most prominent of the Constitutional party, such as laki Zade, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, Ehtesham-es-Saltaneh, and feeyyed Mohammed. The Ministers are disunited: Nizam-es-Saltaneh is mistrusted by his colleagues; he is, moreover, alleged to have allowed the Shah to draw on the lieasury, and is suspected also by the people. Meantime, dissensions have appeared in the Medjhss itself. On the 26th instant there was a violent scene, lasting over an hour, in which the Deputies accused each other of peculation and self-interest, and the Financial Committee of the House was alleged to have connived at the grant of one or two pensions without any kind of justification; the President also has become an object of suspicion, and is accused of having joined the Shah’s party and of scheming to drive Taki Zade out of the House and to crush his party. Ehtesham-es-Saltaneh has also had a violent quarrel with the great Mujtehed, Seyyed Abdullah, whom he accused of accepting bribes. The Medjliss, indeed, seems to have split into three parties, those of the President, numbering some sixty-five Deputies, being the largest; that of Seyyid Abdullah is somewhat smaller; while Taki Zade’s counts but twenty-five supporters. The situation is, however, extremely confused, and it is impossible to say how it will develop, but the resignation of the President seems inevitable. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual summary of events in Persia during the last month, including a resume of the proceedings of the Assembly. The condition of Shiraz is, happily, decidedly calmer, but in Tabreez and Yezd there have, during the last week, been the gravest disorders. The Persian Government is, I fear, quite helpless to maintain order, and, in reply to the repeated representations I have been obliged to make in connection with such cases as those of Yezd, the incident at Charbar, and the necessity of protecting the telegraph official at Kashan, I can elicit nothing more reassuring than that “the necessary measures will be taken.” As regards Yezd, “ the necessary measures” were represented by a telegram addressed to the Chief Mujtehed of the town asking him to use his influence to quell the riot. In the Assembly the most notable event is the change of feeling towards the President, who only a month ago enjoyed the general confidence of the popular party, but is now, without any very apparent reason, looked upon with the greatest suspicion. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHAELES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 99. Extract from Summary of Events for the month ending January 30, 1908. Tehran. The National Assembly.—During the past four weeks the proceedings of the Assembly, so far as they were conducted in public, have been even more irregular and purposeless than usual. A marked feeling of depression has been noticeable a m ong' the more serious_ Members, and the incidents of the last two days have shown that internal discord is strongly marked. Qn the 4th January the Entish and Russian identic letters to the President ofthe 30th December, concerning the Shah’s assurances of support to the Constitution ^ were read. On the 7th January a similar letter, addressed to the President by the German Chargd d’Affaires, as well as a communication on the same subject from the Turkish Ambassador, was read. On the 23rd January a deputation of Members waited on the Shah, who reiterated his previous assurances of support. On the 26th January the President announced the intention of the German Government to greatly enlarge the present German College, for the purpose of instructing 700 pupils instead of 120 as heretofore. An increased subscription from the Persian Government would be necessary for this purpose, which he asked the House to sanction. He was reminded that the matter should come through the proper official channel, i.e., the Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Education. On the 28th January the President pnblicly denounced the Great Mujtehed, Seyed Abdullah, as corrupt, and, in reality, reactionary. He roundly abused the Mujtehed, and even accused some of the Members of corruption. He added that, though it had been his intention to vacate the Presidency and go to London as Persian Minister, he had now made up his mind to remain in the chair, as the Mujtehed had tried to force him to resign. This open declaration of war on the part of the President is interpreted by the public as a sign of treason on his part to the popular cause. It has long been known that Seyed Abdullah is swayed by dishonest motives, but the present moment is not thought to he opportune for a breach with the Great Mujtehed, who, with his colleague Seyed Mohammed, has from the outset been intimately con nected with the popular movement. It is therefore thought that the President is acting in the interests of the Shah. On the 9th January some of the roughs who created a disturbance in the middle of December were flogged in the principal “ maidan,” and on the 13th January Sani Hazret, the leader of the roughs, was captured by the police and imprisoned. The Ttussian Minister had a long audience ol the Shah on the L2th January, and advised His Majesty most earnestly to abstain from all further attempt to overthrow the constitutional regime in view of the grave danger which he would thereby incur. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had a separate audience on the 14th January, and also spoke to the Shah in the same sense. His Majesty replied, as he had done on former occasions, that, far from wishing to overthrow the Constitution, he was himself the only true constitutionalist in Persia, the Members of the National Assembly and Enjumens being common revolutionaries. Mr. Marling laid great stress on the impracticability of stemming the wave of popular feeling and reverting to the former system of autocracy, and on the grave dangers to His Majesty which such a course would entail. The previous day Azad-ul-Mulk and Shoa-es-Sultaneh spoke to the Shah in the same sense, and His Majesty received a deputation of Members of the Assembly, to whom he again took oath on the Koran to observe and uphold the Constitution. The Shah has pardoned Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh, his brother, who had. been kept in confinement in one of the Royal gardens outside Tehran since the rebellion he led last summer. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL, Oriental Secretary. Tabreez. On the 17th January a fight broke out between the revolutionaries and some roughs. Fighting lasted for two days, and twenty people were killed or wounded. Intermittent fighting, however, continued until the end of the month, when cavalry and infantry were posted in the town to keep order. This step restored tranquillity. These disturbances are stated to be due to the action of the Shah, who had planne to have riots in Tabreez at the time that he made his coup d Etut in Tehran. Resht. The excitement caused by the disturbances at Tehran seems to have died out, and the province of Ghilan appears to be in a normal condition. [1072] H 3Persian Gulf. Bushire. The news of the disturbances at Tehran created a good deal of excitement. Telegrams were received from the National Assembly, the leading priests of Tehran, and from Eesht asking for support for the National Assembly. A favourable reply was sent. Bunder Abbas. The country round the town being in a very disturbed condition, His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing ” was ordered to Bunder Abbas and remained there for the first two weeks of December. Later, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the Governor- General of the Gulf ports, the situation improved, but caravan traffic remained suspended. Charbar. On the 25th January the Resident, Persian Gulf, telegraphed that reports had reached him from Charbar that a representative of Serdar Said Khan, of Geh, with fifty armed men, had seized the Customs and was demanding, under threat of force from British traders, money due by them to the Customs. This man claimed that he was acting with the authority of the Persian Government. The Resident, having ascertained that this was untrue, directed the traders only to pay if threatened with force, and then under protest. At the same time he requested Said Khan’s representa tive to delay further action for forty-eight hours, warning him he would have to reckon with the British Government if he did not. His Majesty’s ship “ Perseus ” was meanwhile ordered to Charbar, but arrived to find that the Baluchis had levied the customs duties by force and decamped. Similar action was taken at the same time by another Chief at Gwetter. (Signed) C. B. STOKES, Major. No. 100. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 17, 1908.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received February 26.) gj r Tehran, February 14, 1908. IN my efforts to obtain the payment of the overdue interest on the 1903-4 Loan, I have constantly made use of the weapon provided me by the instructions contained in your telegram of the 19th December, and when on the 27th January Mushir- ed-Dowleh informed me that the moneys would be paid forthwith, I hoped that the desired result was attained. On 'the following day, however, M. Mornard, the Administrator of the Customs, informed me that no order for the payment to be effected had reached him, nor had he any reason to anticipate that such an order was likely to be issued for the moment. In these circumstances it appeared to me requisite that stronger pressure should be applied, and I therefore ventured to suggest by my telegram of the 28th January that I might be authorized to inform the Persian Government that, in view of the time which they had allowed to pass without replying to the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree to the suspension of the sinking fund, His Majesty’s Government considered those conditions to have been tacitly accepted. [1072] 11 4There is no doubt that the prospect that their liberty to raise a foreign loan might be still further circumscribed than at present has far greater weight with the Persian Government than any claim for money however strongly pressed, and I theiefore hoped that a communication in the sense above indicated would serve to clinch the matter. There was also every prospect that, witli the interminable delays consequent on the existing system of referring all public questions to Committees of Assembly, no reply would have been given to my note, and the tacit acceptance of our conditions would have been acquired. On the 6th instant the Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that the moneys had actually been paid, but inquiry at the bank showed that his Excellency was mistaken. The dismissal of M. Mornard from the post of Administrator of Customs left the custody of the revenues of that Department in the hands of the Minister of Commerce, Kaim Makam, who is remarkable for corruption and peculation ; and the prospect of the moneys set aside for meeting the debt due to His Majesty’s Government being paid seemed to be seriously jeopardized. I therefore on the 8th instant, in speaking to Mushir-ed Dowleh on the subject of M. Mornard’s dismissal, insisted that his Excellency should write to Kaim Makam and warn him against touching these funds. His Excellency agreed to do so, but said that the order for payment was already issued. On the following day M. Mornard called on me and informed me that the order was prepared, and required only the signature of the Minister of Finance ; he believed I could count on seeing the payment made within twenty-four hours, and, Mr. Rabino, who happened to come in at the moment, thought that I could regard the question as settled. On the evening of the 11th, however, Mr. Rabino informed me that he had encashed nothing, and, as 1 had not received your authority to make a communication in the sense of my telegram above mentioned, I addressed the note, of which a copy is inclosed, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mushir-ed- Dowleh, to whom I handed the note personally, again asserted that the money had actually been paid, and seemed much surprised when I assured him that such was not the case. It is quite possible, as the Minister assured me, that the order for payment was prepared, and only requires the signature of the Minister of Finance. The anxiety of his Excellency Nizam-es-Saltaneh for the life of his only son, who has been dangerously ill, and the interruption of business consequent on the religious observances of the “ Katl ” may have well prevented the accomplishment of the last formality ; but, on the other hand, it seems probable that the campaign of intrigue against M. Mornard has been an equally important factor. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 101. Mr. Marling to Mushir-ed-Dowleh.

Spring-Rice’s note 'of the 31st August, 1907, which His Majesty’s Government attached to their assent to the request of the Persian Government for the suspension for three years of the sinking fund on that loan. In the cncumstances, I have no option but to inform your Excellency, m accordance with the instructions of my Government, that unless that interest is paid forthwith, and a formal acceptance of the conditions above alluded to given to the Legation without delay, His Majesty’s Government will demand the immediate payment of the full amount of the annuity instead of the interest only, I avail, &amp;c.

Sir, Tehian, February 26, 1908. A PATtSEE gentleman, a brother of Parviz, who was murdered in Shiraz about a year ago, called on me recently and said that the Parsees throughout Persia were in a state of grave anxiety. He quoted the recent murder of Fereidoun in Tehran and the threatening letters which have been sent to a leading member of the community at Shiraz as proof of the insecurity in which they live, and asked it the Legation could not give some publicity to the interest which His Majesty’s Government take in their welfare. After a little discussion I agreed to address a note on the subject to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and to request him verbally to cause its contents to be communicated to the Assembly. When I saw Mushir-ed-Dowleh a few days later, his Excellency informed me that he had already taken that step, and that he had also laid my note, of which a copy is inclosed, before the Shah, as he thought that a hint in that quarter was of more consequence than in the Assembly. Mr. Grahame has since reported that the local Notables and authorities are bestirring themselves to befriend the Parsees in Shiraz, and he himself has offered the asylum of the Consulate to the merchant who has been the object of threatening letters. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 103. Mr. Marling to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Your Excellency, Tehran, February 5, 1908 MOST disquieting accounts have reached me of late respecting the position of the Parsees throughout Persia, but more particularly in Shiraz and Yezd, and, as your Excel lency is aware, a leading member of the community was quite recently murdered in Tehran itself. His Majesty’s Government, which I need not remind your Excellency takes^ a very warm interest in the welfare of the Zoroastrians, cannot regard this state of affairs without grave concern, and I therefore have the honour to request that your Excellency would cause the necessary steps to be taken to afford proper security and protection to these peaceable and blameless people. Reports have already been current that unless their existence in Persia is rendered more tolerable by a greater measure of security being assured to them the Parsees may leave the country. The Imperial Government cannot fail to recognize what a serious loss would be entailed on Persia by the disappearance of an industrial mercantile community such as the Parsees, and will, I feel confident, take every possible measure to restore their confidence in the wish and in the ability of the Imperial authorities to protect them from ignorant or fanatical attack and persecution. For this purpose I venture to think that no more effective step could be taken than the punishment of the persons concerned in the assassination of Fereidoun, some of whom, at all events, I have every reason to believe, are well known to the Imperial Government.

No reply to that communication has, however, yet been received, nor has the Imperial Government made payment of the amount overdue for sinking fund since the 4th April, 1 907. Under these circumstances, I have the honour to inform your Excellency, under the instructions of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that His Britannic Majesty’s Government consider that, by failing to effect any payment, and notwithstanding the repeated verbal representations which I have had the honour to make on the subject, by neglecting to give any reply to Sir C.

The National Assembly .—The unsatisfactory state of affairs reported in the last summary has not been improved. On the 16th February the House, after an excited debate, voted for the dismissal ot Assef-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of the Interior, on various charges, including that of having permitted Kavam-ul-Mulk to return to Fars without the sanction of the House. The Cabinet is, in consequence, again under reconstruction. Sani-ed-Dowlehhas accepted the Finance Ministry, and Nizam-es-Sultaneh is to retain the Premiership with the Ministry of the Interior. Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh still acts as President, and his attack of the 28th January on Seyed Abdullah was not followed by any trouble, the Mujtehed preferring to treat the matter with contempt. There is still a feeling of anxiety as to what step the Shah and his reactionary entourage will take next. Rumours are current of another impending coup (VElat, but the past four weeks have on the whole been comparatively quiet. Saad-ed-Dowleh is still at the Dutch Legation. The Press .—Violently anti-dynastic and even revolutionary articles continue to appear in the Tehran press. One paper extolled the assassins of the King and Crown Prince of Portugal; another paper publishes weekly tirades on the Kajars. The “ Enjumens” or Political Societies .—A list of 100 Enjumens has been supplied to the Legation, of which the Enjumen Azerbaijan (President, Taki^ Zade, with 2,962 members) is the most important.

The Governor has received the following reinforcements: 100 Timuri horsemen, 200 Kurdish horsemen, and the Semnan regiment. He has recovered fitty-foui captives from the Turkomans. The local Assembly having directed him not to move his camp to Ak Kalleh until all the plundered property had been recovered, the Governor requested the National Assembly to send him more troops or to direct the local Assembly not to interfere with him. Resht. On the 5th February the Deputy Governor of Kasma was assassinated at that place. Up to the 15th February the assassins had not been captuied. the muider has created a panic among other Governors of districts. In Fumen no land-owner now dares to visit his properties. Meshed. Meshed continues quiet. Interest has centred in the municipal elections, which were controlled by the popular party. Certain reactionary priests united to suppress the movement, but found open opposition useless. The leading priest in Meshed, from fear of the consequences, supported the popular party. Ispahan. On the 15th February the Governor resigned and left for Tehran. Yezd. On the 20th February a telegram was received reporting that the post to Yezd had been robbed at Nogunbuz. It appears that the robbers also carried oti the post- horses of three stages, Nain, Nogunbuz, Chahinoh, also six men and forty-two donkeys from a caravan which had halted on the way. The post from Yezd was robbed on the 17th February at Chahinoh, the driver shot, and the rifles and cartridges of three guards with him taken, also four post-horses belonging to Akda. Four stages were thus denuded of horses and the postal service disorganized. Kashan. On the 14th February the Governor, with 50 sowars from Tehran and 200 Kashis, attempted to force the position of Naib Hussein at Dowg. I he latter was reported to have routed them single-handed. On the 16th February the Governor arrested some thieves and secured several thousand tomans worth of stolen property, which was supposed to have been looted by Naib Hussein. A party of roughs attacked the Governor’s house and released the prisoners. Fighting continued, and the Governor was said to be leaving for Tehran, the people having gone over to the side of Naib Hussein. The Persian Government has since informed His Majesty s Legation thatNaib Hussein and his party are on their way to Tehran to take refuge at the British Legation, but on arriving at Kum they took sanctuary in the mosque. Seistan. The Persian post which left Seistan for Meshed on the 21st February was stolen between Nasratabad and Baring. A sowar with it was killed, and 1,000 tomans, the property of the Imperial Bank of Persia, were stolen. The correspondence bags were subsequently recovered. Kerman. A band of 150 robbers has established itself at Shams, on the Yezd road, and has already taken over 2,000 sheep from the surrounding villages. Some 200 sowars and infantry looted the district round Bafsinjan about the middle of January. They subsequently moved off towards Bardsir and Mashig. Shiraz. A feud between the Headmen of Konartakhte and Daliki culminated in fighting on the Bushire road between those two places from the 23rd January to the 27th. On the 21 st January it was reported that the up post from Bushire had been robbed at Pul-i-Daliki, and from that date until the middle of February no post got through to Shiraz. Mr. Grahame made representations to the Governor-General, and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to the Persian Government. The Ispahan road also continues disturbed. A leading Parsee merchant in Shiraz having received threatening letters, representations were made by His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government, with the result that orders for the protection of Parsees there were telegraphed to the Foreign Office Agent. Persian Gulf. Bushire. The Lingah Agent reports that the news of the capture of the Humaidi pirates by the British authorities, brought down the Gulf by native craft from Bunder Big, caused general satisfaction. In Bushire there has been open rejoicing in the coffee- shops frequented by the seafaring classes. Bunder Abbas. the caravan trade, which had been entirely suspended for six weeks, owing to the disturbed state of the country, was resumed at the end of December. Caravans arrived from Kerman and Lar. The Kerman caravans came by the Jiruft-Bam route, the Baft-Dowletabad road being still unsafe. (Signed) C. B. STOKES, Major, Military Attachd. Supplement to Monthly Summary of February 28, 1908. Attempt on the Shah’s life, February 28, 1908. The Shah, who had not been out of the Palace since he paid his state visit to the National Assembly on the 12th November, 1907, was proceeding at 3 p.m. to his country seat at Dochantapeh when a determined attempt was made on his life. The procession was formed of a motor-car in front and a carriage behind, with the usual escort of horsemen and running footmen. A little way past the house of the Manager of the Imperial Bank, and before reaching that of the Zil-es-Sultan^ a fusillade was opened on the motor-car, in which it was supposed the Shah rode, by some persons from the adjoining roofs, who evidently could not see into the vehicles from their elevated position. Two bombs were then thrown at the motor-car completely shattering it, and killing two persons and wounding about seven others. The Shah, who was seated in the carriage behind the motor-car, immediately emerged109 and took refuge in an adjoining house. Great confusion of course immediately ensued, and His Majesty returned to the Palace on foot in safety. Dr. Lindley, who saw His Majesty, found him in a very agitated condition. The courtiers were all offering their congratulations. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires deputed Abbas Kuli Khan to offer his congratulations to the Shah on his miraculous escape. (Initialled) G. P. C. No. 106. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received, March 16.) Sir^ Tehran, February 26, 1908. THE month of Moharrem is practically over, and, contrary to general anticipa tions, there has been no sort of disturbance. The long expected reconstruction of the Ministry commenced on the 20th instant, when Assaf-ed-Dowleh was dismissed by a vote of the Assembly, nominally for having permitted Kavam-ul-Mulk to return to Shiraz against the known wishes of the bars Deputies; the real reason being that the Medjliss, though determined to bring about a change in the Cabinet, were afraid to make a clean sweep all at once, and selected the Minister of the Interior to begin with. His portfolio has been taken over by Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who vacates the Ministry of Finance. Though these changes are probably not final, they are not unsatisfactory so far as they go. Sani-ed-Dowleh is certainly more satisfactory as a Finance Minister than Nizam-es-Sultaneh. The latter was accepted as Prime Minister by the Parliament in the hope that, with his great experience and knowledge of the country, he would be able to restore some degree of order; but he has never enjoyed the real confidence of the Constitutional party, as he is essentially a statesman of the old school. Sani-ed-Dowleh, who succeeds him in the Ministry of Finance, was the first President of the Assembly. ^ A report of a further change, viz., the dismissal of Kavam Makam by the Shah, has just reached me. _ u During the past month the Shah has abstained from overt interference in the affairs of the country; but circumstantial rumours are current that he is preparing for another coup d’Etat, the chief foundation for which appears to be a repoit that he is importing a quantity of rifles via M.ohammerah, and that his retainers from Veiamin are again being organized into some semblance of a fighting force, the political Societies are very suspicious of some move on His Majesty’s part. The popular dissatisfaction with the Assembly is gaining strength, and m oidei to meet the general demand for an improvement in its composition, a number of vacancies caused by death or resignations have been filled by new Members selected by the Assembly itself. The public proceedings of the House, on the other hand, tend to become more and more formal, and all real business is conducted either in secret sittings or in the private meetings of the various Committees of the House. The system is pernicious, as it gives greater facilities to powerful Deputies to work in their own personal interests, and it is one of the causes ot the growing discontent with the Medjliss. It is, however, likely to receive further extension by the creation of a Medjliss club, a proposal made by Ehteshem-es-Sultaneh, who apparently in despair of getting any practical results from the Assembly itself, believes that the only remedy is to transfer its functions to a private and irresponsible caucus. The general summary for the month shows that there is no real improvement in the condition of the provinces. Shiraz remains relatively quiet. The arrival of the new Governor, Sahib Ikhtiar (Vazir Makhsous), has passed off quietly enough ; but it remains to be seen what will be the result of the appearance of Kavam-ul-Mulk, to w^hose return the Governor agreed, in spite of the known wishes of the rars Depu ies. I myself strongly opposed the proposed return of this powerful but intugumg ne last autumn ; but as his detention in Tehran did not seem to conduce, as the Persian Government themselves anticipated, to the restoration of order m iars,_ I contented myself on the present occasion with conveying to him a strong warning that the renewal of disturbance will be the signal for a demand for his lecall. be govern ment of the province will virtually be in his hands, as he has accepted the task o collecting the “maliat,” a duty which may, Mr. Grahame anticipates, createmmammmm 110 difficulties between him and the Governor, and Sahih Ikhtiar, who is not a strong man, is already somewhat apprehensive. Yezd and Mashan have been practically in the hands of the mob ; Ispahan is added to the list of provinces without a Governor ; and Kerman has sent a message to its Governor-designate that he will be well advised to stay awa}^. Caravan traffic between Bushire and Shiraz is at a standstill, no post having succeeded in passing since the 14th January ; and an equally serious state of affairs prevails on the Tehran-Yezd road, on which communications are cut by the presence of a strong band of brigands at Nain. In the east there has been a somewhat serious robbery of the post between Nasratabad and Birjand. Mushir-ed-Dowleh has also informed me that there has been a serious disturbance in the neighbourhood of Khorremabad, and that the local Governor is practically besieged by Lur tribesmen at Kila-el-Aflak. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 107. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .— {Received April 13.) kh’j ^ Tehran, March 26, 1908. WITH regard to the attempt on the Shah’s life on the 28th ultimo, I think that the following details of the occurrence are substantially accurate :— His Majesty left the Palace by the eastern entrance in an open six-horsed carriage, preceded by a similar vehicle, and also by a motor-car with the hood up, driven by a French chauffeur. The procession was headed by a number of Palace guards, some of whom were also riding abreast of the three vehicles, while that which conveyed his Majesty was escorted closely by Amir Behadur Jang and M. Chapchal The chauffeur appears to have had some apprehensions that an attentat might be attempted, for, when in the narrow street a few yards beyond M. Rabino’s house he saw a man step forward from a small side street holding something wrapped in cloth in his hand, he at once put on full speed in the hope of passing clear of the coming explosion. Ihe would-be assassin also must have lost his sang-froid, for the bomb struck the ground before reaching the car, and also somewhat too far back to injure the driver, who was, however, hurled from his seat, but without injury. The car itself was comparatively slightly damaged, a shattered panel in the body and a large hole in the hood being the worst injury. A moment later a second bomb was thrown, which fell between the motor car and the fiist carriage, and by its explosion killed one of the leading horses and wounded the other, and at the same time shots were fired from the flat roofs of the nearest houses. Two persons were killed by the bomb and seven or eight injured All was confusion among the Shah’s people : Amir Behadur Jang and M. Chapchal pushed up to the scene of the explosion, leaving the Shah for a few moments quite alone. Both drew their revolvers and began firing at the people on the roof, but the latter was by his own account, so excited that, though he believed he had emptied his pistol, he never, as a matter of fact, succeeded in firing a single shot. He and Amir Behadur Jang suddenly remembered that the Shah was unprotected, and hastily returned to find His Majesty getting out of his carriage. They then tried to get His Majesty into the nearest house, but, finding the door barred, crossed the street to the house of the Shah’s head coachman where they gained admittance. The Shah was quite calm at the moment, and asked for a glass of water, but was induced, by the suggestion that he might be offered a poisoned draught, to await the arrival of his own water bearer He then suggested leaving the house and returning to the Palace, but no sooner had he emerged on the street than two or three shots were fired, one of which is said to have struck the wall close by His Majesty then seized a rifle from one of the Bakhtiari guards standing by and attempted to return the shot, but was prevented by M Chapchal and Amir Behadur Jang, who unceremoniously hustled their master back into shelter. Once inside the house His Majesty gave way for a few minutes to an outburst of passion, and ordered that the whole quarter should be destroyed and its inhabitants slam. His wrath was soon over, and as soon as the firing ceased His Majesty started on foot for the Palace, and on the way was greeted wdth consider able enthusiasm. It is a somewhat disquieting symptom that, as soon as they became aware of tb©attempt on the Shah’s life, Amir Behadur Jang’s guard began to rob the passers-by in the street and to pillage the neighbouring houses. They even stole two horses from a tramcar, which, however, were returned the following morning. ^ It is a lamentable fact that, despite the cheers with which the Shah was received immediately after his escape, the general feeling in the capital, and in many places m the provinces also, was one of regret that the attempt had failed. On the following day a few arrests were made, but it was generally understood that the real culprits were at liberty ; indeed, no serious effort seems to have been made to discover them, for it was not till four days after the outrage that it occunecl to the authorities to take the obvious measure of forcing open the locked doors of the house whence the second bomb was thrown, and such was the apathy displayed that the Shah was forced to send a Bescript to the Assembly to stimulate the Government into activity. The bombs were of small size and made of thin cast iron, a fact which is held to prove that they must have been of foreign origin, as the art of casting m iron is scarcely known in this country. The wildest rumours _ have been current as to the instigators of the attentat: the first person on whom suspicion fell was Zil-es-bultan, whose “ anderoon ” (women’s quarters)' windows overlooked the scene; next the Azerbaiian Eniumen was accused, but apparently for no better reason than that Tabreez was the city whence the Shah had been most violently denounced during t e December crisis. Towards the end of the month public interest was for a few days aroused anew by the murder of Kavam-ul-Mulk, and the attempt on his sons h e at Shiraz but it soon died away again, and at present there seems to be but little prospect that any further serious steps will be taken to push the inquiry to a conclusion. . „ . . , , The bomb which exploded on the morning following the attentat, appears to have been hastily hidden by the would-be assassins. It was discovered by the two outdoor servants of Sahib Ekhtiar, who were removing rubbish. I 1t.cLV0 &amp;c. (Signed) ’ CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 108.

Writing on the 10th March, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul stated that Acting Governors Mohtashem-ul-Mulk and Serdar Homayun have both resigned. New political Societies were being formed daily, and trade was at a standstill. Tbe town was unsafe at night, citizens being attacked and shops looted. Kerman. Early in February four men entered tbe house of a Parsee merchant at Rafsinjan and, after plundering his shop of 1,500 tomans worth of money and goods, fired at him with revolvers and left him for dead. The Parsee managed after some hours to reach a friend’s house, where, being unable to speak, as one bullet had lodged in his throat, he wrote an account of the occurrence. The wounded man was brought into Kerman, where it was found that he had six bullets in his throat and jaw. Hopes are entertained of his recovery. Of late, both in Bam and in Kerman, Parsees have been maltreated by roughs. They appealed for protection to His Majesty’s Consul, who obtained from the Deputy Governor a promise that he would do what he could. ^ During February Kerman continued in a disturbed condition, the Adil-es-Sultan s return to town leading to fresh disorders. The Ala-ul-Mulk, who had been appointed Governor, but was transferred to Ispahan while en route to Kerman, was succeeded by Sirdar Motazid. This appointment was unpopular, and led to the closing of the bazaars. Two Hindu traders were, about tbe 15th February, robbed by bve mounted men of 1,500 tomans worth of property a few miles from Malun. ’Kabuter Khan, the second stage out on the Yezd road, has recently been looted and the post horses stolen. Kermanshah, The arrival of Seyed Akber, a reactionary mollah from Tehran, led to some disturbances in tbe first week in March. The Acting-Governor, however, restored order, and the Seyed was, in accordance with orders from Tehran, expelled and sent to The Guran district has lately been in a state of disturbance owing to quarrels among the lieutenants of the hereditary Governor, Mansur-ul-Mulk. Fath-es-Sultaneb, fatber-in-law of Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh, recently raided and captured the town of Khorremabad. He looted all tbe property of tbe Governor, who took refuge in the house of the Chief Priest. The Governor of Lunstan is nephew of the present Prime Minister, Nizam-es-Sultaneh. Shiraz. Sahib Ekhtiar, Governor-General of Pars, arrived at his post on the 8th February. In an interview with His Majesty’s Consul, he stated that he thought the Kavam-ub Mulk’s return to Shiraz would cause trouble. The Kavam arrived on the 20th February from Tehran. On the 7th March tbe Kavam was shot in his own court-yard, five bullets strikinD- him, and a sixth killing a servant who had tried to save his master. The Kavam died about twenty minutes later. The assassin then shot himself m the abdomen but was secured and imprisoned. Mr. Grahame went to the Kavam’s house as soon as he received news of the affair. The two sons of the Kavam (Salar-es-bultan and Nasr-ed-Dowleh) informed him that the murderer, one Nemetullah, had recently been in the service of Motamid-i-Divan as coachman. They threatened vengeance on Motamid-i-Divan as the author of the crime, and produced a piece of paper said to be taken from the pocket of the murderer on which was written “ murderer of JSasr-ed- Dowleh.” They declared that they knew whose the writing was. Mr. Grahame beo-o-ed them to check any excesses on the part of their followers. The murderer died a few hours later, after having, according to Kavam’s sons, confessed that Motamid-i- Divan and the Lari Seyed had instigated the crime. _ Mr. Grahame next interviewed the Governor-General, who was much perturbed, and practically abdicated his powers m favour of the Kavam’s sons. Next day Mr. Grahame found the Governor-General rather less perturbed. His Excellency summoned Motamid-i-Divan to the palace for examination and he was brought there after dark under a strong escort. On the 9th March at the obsequies of the Kavam, Salar-es-Sultan was shot m the thigh, and one “ tile’leading priests was also hit, it is said, by the same bullet. The priest died thesame day, but Salar-es-Sultan is recovering. One Seyed Ahmed Dastaki, a leader ot the faction opposed to the Kavam, was said to have fired the shot. He was killed; his body was then gibbeted, drenched with oil and burned, and the remains were thrown in the town ditch. It is now asserted that the Seyed did not fire the shot. On the same day the Kavamis demanded the blood of the Motamid-i-Divan from the Governor-General, but only received an evasive reply. The 10th passed quietly, and by the 11th March public opinion, at first favourable to Salar-es-Sultan, had turned against him. The Zil-es-Sultan, having been appointed Governor-General of Favs, has left Tehran for Shiraz. Meanwhile the situation, if no worse, shows no signs of improve ment. The Bushire road, after being closed for a month by disturbances, was opened again on the 17th February. Posts are once more arriving in time. Persian Gulf. Bushire. The money which was subscribed in Bushire last year and sent to Tehran towards the establishment of a National Bank has been returned to Bushire and paid back to the subscribers, the project having fallen through. The oppression by local Chiefs on the Bushire-Shiraz road of muleteers using that road has recently formed the subject of representations by His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. No. 110. Mr. Marling to Sir Edivard Grey.—[Received April 13.) Sir, Tehran, March 27, 1908. THOUGH the past four weeks have not produced any very marked alteration in the general situation, such change as is apparent is, I regret to say, for the worse rather than for the better. After the unsuccessful attempt on his life, the Shah, in spite of the advice which is alleged to have been urged on him by some of the reactionaries at the Palace, has remained apparently passive, and his relations with the Assembly have been accompanied by less friction than at any other period. It is too much to hope that this is the result of any change of His Majesty’s feelings towards his Parliament; it is rather the result of the attentat, and perhaps also of the consciousness that the Medjliss is becoming so discredited and unpopular that it may die a natural death. The Assembly has continued to lose ground in public esteem, partly on account of its own inherent inefficiency, but partly also owing to the ill-judged efforts of the President to improve its working. His preference for conducting business in the privacy of Committees has extended to the ordinary sittings of the House, of which at present about one in three are held with closed doors ; and he has further issued regulations for the admission of the public. As he possesses considerable authority with the Deputies, this apparent design to veil his proceedings from the public gaze produces a general disposition to believe that Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh is no longer the ardent patriot, but is working in other interests, either those of the Shah or his own. He has consequently become exceedingly unpopular, and a few days ago it seemed quite on the cards that he would be forced to resign. Possibly the event which may have the most effect on the situation in Tehran is the removal for the time being ef Zil-es-Sultan by his appointment as Governor of Pars. He was an object of distrust to the Shah, who was anxious to be rid of his dangerous relative, and pressed him to go to Europe for a* season. Zil-es-Sultan probably meant to do so, for he went so far as to ask the Hussian Minister to £et a ship of wai placed at his disposal to convey him from Enzeli to Petrovsk, whilst he also came to pay me a visit to announce his impending departure. However, the next morning I received news which convinced me that His Imperial Highness'had abandoned the idea of leaving Persia, and the rumours that he was to supersede Sahib Ekhtiar at Shiraz left no doubt about the reason for his change of plans. The confusion which followed the murder of Kavam-ul-Mulk in Shiraz showed that Sahib Ekhtiar had not the qualities necessary to govern that turbulent town ;the Governor, in fact, completely lost his head, and I think it is not too much to say, what is hardly sufficiently brought out in the necessarily brief account of the occurrences given in the monthly summary, that it was primarily owing to the energy and tact displayed by Mr. Consul Grahame, and his personal influence in the town, that serious fighting did not ensue. In quieter times Sahib Ekhtiar might make an excellent Governor, but as he is of a timorous disposition, and has not the money to find the troops which the Government had been unable to send him, I thought it better not to comply with his request for the support of the Legation to maintain him in his orfice, and merely urged the Government to take such measures as they could to maintain order. Zil-es-Sultan, at all events, possesses many of the qualities which Sahib Ekhtiar lacks : he is very wealthy, can probably raise a sufficient force of men from among his villages at Ispahan to enforce respect for his authority, and is reputed to have been a strong Governor. From the general summary it will be seen that, though there have been no serious disorders, a condition of peaceful anarchy continues, and there is no sign that the Central Government is any more able than formerly to enforce its authority.

THE presidency of the Assembly, to which Mukhber-ul-Mulk was elected after the forced resignation of Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh, was not accepted by the former, and Momtaz-ed-Dowleh was elected to the presidency on the 4th April. The new President is a brother of the Persian Minister in Paris, and was Private Secretary to the Ain-ed-Dowleh while that Prince was Prime Minister during^ 1904 and 1905. He speaks French very well, and was for some time in the Foreign Office. His election was decided upon by the predominant Tabreezi party in the Assembly in order to be assured of a President who would not show that independence which made the Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh so unpopular. It was even suggested by Taki Zade that a new President should be elected every three months, but the motion was not pushed to a division. General News. Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh left suddenly for Europe on the 3rd Aprd. The trial of the persons accused of the murder of the Parsee merchant, Erbab Fereidoun, has been going on for some time at the Courts of Justice. The proceedings are public, and are reported fully in a special newspaper called the Mohakamat. Some of the prisoners have confessed their guilt, and it is quite clear that their object was common robbery, and not in any way political, as was at first surmised. The chief priests will eventually be asked to deliver judgment.^ T . . The Zil-es-Sultan, after remaining about a fortnight at Ispahan, is now proceeding leisurely to Shiraz.

CHURCHILL, Oriental Secretary. Tehran, April 22, 1908. Tahreez. During March Tabreez and its immediate surroundings remained quiet. In the town itself the new Chief of Police, a leading member of the local Assembly, has raised a very smart-looking body of policemen who are dressed in uniform, and each carries a rifle and fifty cartridges. The streets are patrolled by them day and night. Govern ment allows 3,600 tomans for their expenses. The Ardebil district was in March in a disturbed condition. The Shahseven tribes were pillaging the villages, and a party of them raided Ardebil, where they robbed some fifty houses, killing some of the inmates. The Governor, Rashid-ul-Mulk, fled to Tabreez. Kum. A demonstration has been made by the people of Kum against the levy of tolls by Messrs. Lynch on the Kum-Sultanabad road, and they actually wrecked a toll-house outside Kum. His Majesty’s Legation has communicated on the subject with Seyed Abdullah Mujtehed, who sent strongly-worded telegrams to the clergy of Kum depre cating their action, and pointing out that Messrs. Lynch were acting in strict accord with an Arrangement concluded with the Central Government. Astrabad. The Governor has been displaying great energy, and appears to have effectively quieted the Turkoman tribes. Meshed. Meshed continues quiet, but in the provinces murders appear to be on the increase. In the second week in April the local Assembly was the scene of a serious riot. At the alleged instigation of some of its members, the soldiers, who had appealed against the robbery of ^ their pay, beat a popular reformer. It appears that this individual was urging a fresh election on more popular lines, but the present members wished to be re-elected in a body. Ispahan. The Zil-es-Sultan, who arrived at Ispahan en route to Shiraz on the 24th March, having remained there longer than twenty-four hours, a demonstration hostile to him took place. The demonstrators were attacked by soldiers and others, and some looting took place. The Zil eventually left Ispahan for Shiraz on the 18th April. Kermanshah. A lepoit having reached Tehran that the Deputy Governor of Kermanshah had been responsible for some brutal executions without proper trial, the Minister of the Interior was interpellated on the subject on the 21st instant. He replied that as soon be tried eWS reached hlm he had ordered the -Deputy Governor to come to Tehran to Since the tmddle of March Shiraz has beeu abnormally quiet.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 11.) gj r Tehran, April 24, 1908. WHILE, as will be seen from the monthly summary, the general condition of Persia has been more tranquil, at the capital all the indications show but too clearly that the struggle between the Shah and the Enjumens has lost none of its bitterness. I say advisedly the Enjumens, for in the last trial of strength, in which the Shah was again worsted, the Assembly played a very small part indeed, and the Ministers, except by tendering and withdrawing their resignations within forty-eight hours, none at all. The point at issue was simply whether the Governor of Tehran and Chief of Police, by causing the arrest of the alleged authors of the attempt on the Shah’s life without warrant from the Minister of Justice, had acted constitutionally or not. On the whole, the question may be answered in the negative, but, considering how nearly the matter concerned the Shah, the Enjumens might well have condoned the irregularity. They are, however, so nervously anxious to prevent the smallest infringement by the Shah of the people’s new-won liberties that they insisted on pushing the matter to an issue. _ The outlook is far from hopeful. The Enjumens, conscious of their strength, presume to interfere in every branch of the Administration, and, with the narrow oi ignorant and suspicious views of the majority of their leaders, their interference makes the task of government well nigh impossible. t tl£LV6 &amp;C (Signed) ’ CHARLES M. MARLING. * * No. 113. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received May 25.) Tehran, April 30, 1908. n ’ ON Saturday last, the 25th, the Minister of Finance, who, so far as I can learn, had made no previous public announcement of his intention to do so, presented his Budo'et to the Assembly, and in the speech with which he introduced it stated, as regards his proposals for raising the import duties on tea and sugar, that he had consulted the Representatives of the two interested Powers, Great Britain and Russia, and had every reason to hope that the proposed modification of the lanfl would encounter no opposition Irom them. i x a • j i i i jr Like every one else, M. Bizot was of course aware that Sam-ed-Dowleh had tor Ions been lucubrating some kind of financial scheme based on the elevation of the duties on these articles, but until 3 o’clock on Saturday afternoon, when the Minister of Finance informed him that he was on the way to the House to lay the Budget before it and o-ave him a short sketch of it, I think M. Bizot was as little prepared as I was to hear that a definite scheme had been elaborated. He has at all events never been consulted in any sort of way as to the scheme as a whole, and has not even now been * ‘ t of ifc ^ The French Minister thereupon invited the Russian Minister and myself to hear fioin M. Bizot the impression he had formed of the situation after a month's work m Persia. , met at the French Legation on the 28th, and from M. Bizot’s conversation I gathered his general appreciation of the position to be somewhat as follows :— ’ t q [1072]The Persian Government is practically at the end of its resources. The Department of Finance is daily besieged by crowds clamouring for payment of claims of every sort and kind; the greater part of these claims are for pensions which, more often than not, had never been earned, but obtained by bribery, and which, in many cases, had been abolished by the Assembly. The latter fact, however, made no sort of difference. No one examined the validity of a claim, and merely to be rid of the importunate claimants the Minister of Finance was freely giving out orders on the Customs, which had no funds to meet them, and was consequently in turn besieged by the hungry horde. The general attitude seemed to be based on the belief that sooner or later a foreign loan would be negotiated, and the first thing to be done would be to satisfy all these pensioners from its proceeds. There had been genuine disappointment that when he, M. Bizot, arrived he had not at once pulled millions from his pocket; and when he told Persians that, in his opinion, Persia could not for some little time expect to raise anything hut a very modest loan, they could not believe he was talking seriously, as a smaller loan meant a smaller commission ! When lie first began to work he found it practically impossible to get any informa tion at all. Of late matters had slightly improved in this respect, but it was still exceedingly difficult to get any figures to work on, and the Persians generally, and in particular the Ministry of Finance, seemed bent on preventing him from getting into touch with the people who could assist him and to whom he could give useful advice, such, for instance, as the members of the Finance Committee of the Medjliss. Nasr-ul- Mulk had warned him in Paris that this would be the case, that all his actions and vm-ds would be misrepresented, and that if he made any written proposal to the Minister of Finance he should at the same time send a copy to the Medjliss. Nasr-ul-Mulk s a i ^i- ^ ^ en Onl ^ to o we ^“f° un ^d. As to the Budget, Sani-ed-Dowleh had never asked his assistance in preparing it, though once or twice he had asked him for information which he probably required for that purpose, but until the Minister on baturday afternoon had told him oi its general tenor he had no idea what proposals it contained. r r The conclusion at which we arrived after a long discussion was that it was necessary to prevent the evident inclination that existed to ignore M. Bizot, and it was agieed that for this purpose the Bussian and French Ministers and I should give the Minister for Foreign Affairs to understand that it would be quite useless for the ersian Government to approach the Governments of Great Britain and Russia with any proposal for a modification of the Tariff without having first consulted the Financial isei * Accordingly at his usual reception on the 29th 1 spoke to Mushir-ed-Dowleh, and pointed out to him that, so far from having ever given Sani-ed-Dowleh or any other Persian Minister any encouragement to think that His Majesty’s Government were piepaied to give their assent to any increase of the import duties, I had always been most careful to say that 1 had no knowledge at all of His Majesty’s Government’s views anv nronosTth i ? n , vl “ ced ,ff at they W ' uI&lt; ?

Sam-ed-Dowleh’s statement in Parliament, that he had sounded the Representatives of the two Powers and had found them favourably disposed was belleFthe^tTitud^ 7 7'T aiTantal ? le - ^. far as , I '' as concerned, and, to the best of my 1 a . ttlt 1 ude ofA 6 Russian Minister had all along been the same as my ^anf e“d Dowfeh that a it d 16 Wa f P erfeotl y we , U awar e °f this, and had often told ed-Dowieh that it was no use laying proposals to modify the Customs Tariff before , ‘ “wi bout first obtaining the assent of the Powers having Commercial Treaties ut the Minister of Finance was so convinced of his own financial genius, so o-reedy of popularity m the Medjliss, that he refused to listen to reason, and had brought In his Budget in spite of all warning. The best thing would be that I should speak to him same day on thistubject ' ^ ^ Sp ° ke t0 M u a Wr-ed-Dowleh the i ^ ii T1 M ft ri ( - Wln f . d i a - y 1 s 1 aw Sani-ed-Dowleh and taxed him with having held out hones to the Medjliss which my language to him did not warrant. I had alwfys spoken with the greatest reserve on the question of a modification of tbo Tariff a d f i i iG i the Medjliss to think that he had assured himself of the assent of His Majesty’s Govern ment, when His Majesty s Government had never expressed any opinion ataU on the understand^ X thaf bI IT 'AV. “ ^ ^ the GovlnliZt to icleistand, viz. that His Majesty s Government would not entertain anv kind of proposal on which the Financial Adviser had not been consulted. His Excellency could not have been unaware ot this, and yet he had laid definite ptoposals Se the119 Chamber, and had done no more than inform the Financial Adviser of their general tenor. His Excellency said the financial embarrassment was so great that the Govern ment could not wait until M. Bizot had had time to complete his study of the situation, and he had been obliged to take immediate action unless the country was to be ruined; as to what he had said as to obtaining the assent of the two Powers, he was so con vinced of their friendly attitude that he had felt justified in expressing a confident hope that they would not withhold it. So hopeless, indeed, was the prospect, and so weary was he of the vain struggle of doing something to improve it, that he had that morning decided to resign his office. I said that the one thing which His Majesty’s Government desired was to see Persia peaceful and prosperous, but if we were asked to make^ a concession to the detriment of our commercial interests we were entitled to examine the proposals laid before us, and for this purpose His Majesty’s Government would be content to take the opinion of the Persian Government’s own Financial Adviser. His liixcellency said that he would much prefer that His Majesty’s Government should send out some one from London to examine the situation; if M. Bizot had to be consulted on every question he would virtually become Minister of finance, which would be intolerable.^ Persia did not want a second M. Nans. I scouted the idea of sending some one fiom London. His Excellency had just been talking of the urgent need of finding resources, and yet he now wanted to see a second specialist from Europe who would have to begin again where M. Bizot had started a month ago. If M. Bizot had not learnt as much as could have been wished of the finances of the country, the fault lay solely with the Persian Government, who obstinately declined to furnish him with the material to work on. In declining to avail themselves of the services of the Financial Adviser the Persian Government were acting like a sick man who, having called in a doctor, refused even to ask advice. As for the fear that M. Bizot would ever aim at obtaining the position that M. Nans had occupied, his Excellency must be conscious that such a thing was quite out of the question. M. Bizot had no executive functions; his office was purely advisoiy, and the Persian Government could accept or reject his counsel as they liked. His Excellency reverted again and again to the idea of special experts being sent out from London and St. Petersburg^ to examine the situation, a suggestion^ which I as frequently put aside as one which would never be entertained. Persia, I said, not on y wished to obtain a concession from us practically without return, but wanted to lay down utterly unreasonable conditions as to the manner in which we should grant the favour. I hoped his Excellency would reconsider his decision to resign. Constant changes in the Ministry would not help matters, and, from a merely personal point of view, to resign immediately after introducing his Budget would have a most damaging effect on t e esteem and popularity he so deservedly enjoyed in the country. It is unnecessary to give a detailed account of bam-ed-Dowleh s Budget. Its object ostensibly is to provide a larger revenue in order to enable the Persian Govern ment to restore some degree of order, to construct roads, and to improve public education. For this purpose various new internal taxes are proposed, notably a tax on real property in towns which has hitherto been exempt from any form of taxation, and what is of immediate interest to ourselves, an increase of the import duties on tea and sugar. There is no suggestion of a foreign loan, but it is obvious that, if once a surtax on these commodities were established, the resulting revenue would provide a convenient ouarantee for effecting an operation of that kind. ^ I llcIVG &amp;C.

Monthly Summary of Events in Persia. Tehran. ONT the whole, the situation at Tehran during the last four weeks has been quieter than usual. There is undoubtedly a feeling of considerable depression among the public, and it is recognized by the more intelligent Persians that the machinery of Government is now practically dislocated. The general public, however, still have an exaggerated faith in their £C Constitution,” which has unfortunately already shown signs of corruption. In anticipation of the Shah’s birthday on the 15th May, a very conciliatory rescript was addressed by His Majesty to the Assembly the previous day, which brought about the expected reaction of feeling in favour of the Shah. The usual celebrations took place, in marked contrast to the hostile demonstrations of last year due to an openly reactionary policy. The Cabinet resigned on the 2nd May, and was reappointed on the 6th May, with the alteration of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek in place of Zafar-es-Sultaneh as War Minister. In consequence, however, of the Premier’s resignation again on the 16th May, a further redistribution of posts is imminent. Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who had become exceedingly unpopular, fled to Kum on the 17th May. On the 16th May the Shah addressed a very cordial personal telegram to the Nasr-ul-Mulk, who is travelling in Europe, inviting him to return to Persia as Prime Minister, but it is considered doubtful whether his Excellency will avail himself of the offer. Two persons who had shown active hostility to the reform movement were condemned to long terms of imprisonment, after a form of trial had been gone through at the Courts of Justice. One of them had been guilty of sticking up posters declaring that most of the Members of the Assembly were Babis. (Signed) G. P. CHUBCHILL, Oriental Secretary. May 21, 1908. Meshed. There has been much friction between the local Assembly and the municipality. There appears to be a gradual weakening of authority, but the town is quiet. Turhat-i-Haidai i. The feeling against the local Assembly has proved too much for that body. All the members joined in a Petition to the Governor-General to appoint a Governor for the district. All classes unite in condemning the existing state of affairs, and express themselves hopeless of obtaining any benefit from k£ constitutional rule. Two bands of robbers which had infested the Tabbas district were dispersed during April. Yezd. Serdar Motazid, the new Governor of Kerman, met on the 7th April near Anar a party of forty robbers who were carrying off 1,200 sheep and much plundered122 property. He attacked the robbers, killing eight of them, and compelled them to abandon their booty. His own casualties were one man killed and one man wounded. The Entezam-ul-Mulk arrived at Yezd from Nain on the 20th April on appoint ment as Governor. On the 14th May some 2,000 villagers assembled outside the British telegraph office demanding permission to take sanctuary as a protest against the collection of certain taxes. The bazaars were closed, and the situation seemed serious. Mr. Black man, Acting British Vice-Consul, conferred with the leaders of the crowd, which then went off to the mosques and shrines. The next day the crowd returned, and clamoured for British assistance to get them justice. Mr. Marling telegraphed that assurances would shortly be sent by the National Assembly. This soothed the crowd, but a telegram from the Finance Minister was considered unsatisfactory. On the 18th May a deputation of tradesmen waited on Mr. Blackman asking for sanctuary, as owing to a further large influx of villagers they were fearful for the safety of their shops. Mr. Blackman persuaded them to wait two days for a reply from the National Assembly. On the 19th May a deputation from the leader of the agitation called, and stated that large numbers of villagers, many of them armed, continued to come in, and a very great sense of insecurity prevailed. They feared that these men might break into lawlessness if a reply were long delayed. Some of the crowd came, and in their disappointment at getting no reply and not being allowed into the office, threatened to tear down the flag and break up the office. The deputation apologized for these threats. Mr. Marling called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom he represented the seriousness of the case, and received promises from him that the grievances of the people of Yezd would receive redress. Kermanshah. The district round Kermanshah appears to be much disturbed owing to the tribes being on the move. Mr. and Mrs. Stead, of the American Mission, were recently robbed of all their belongings about 25 miles east of the town. Zafar-es-Sultaneh, ex-Minister of War, has been appointed Governor, and is now on his way to Kermanshah. In the meantime the town appears to be in disorder, and His Majesty’s Consul reports that there are no authorities to whom he can make representations. Shiraz. The Zil-es-Sultan arrived at Shiraz early in May and has sent several telegrams to His Majesty’s Legation stating he had already taken strong measures to preserve order. There was a disturbance in the town just before His Highness arrived, arising out of the publication of a telegram from the great priests of Nejaf regarding- the murder of Kavam-ul-Mulk, but since the Zil-es-Sultan’s arrival matters have°been quieter. Three hundred of the Charmahal Regiment, forming part of the Zil-es-Sultan’s escort, arrived on the 26th April. A telegram, dated the 17th May, from the Assistant Superintendent, Indo- European Telegraph Department, Sniraz, reported that Arab tribesmen were committing depredations between Sivend and Dehbid, and damaging the telegraph line. No. 120. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received June 9.) (Extract.) Gulahek, May 21, 1908. IN continuation^ of my despatch of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour to report that the Persian Cabinet resigned office on the 2nd instant, and the Minister of Finance allowed it to be understood that his own resignation was the immediate consequence of the conversation I had with him a few days earlier. Though it was generally accepted that Ministers had been really actuated by the wish to bring about the formation of a Cabinet from which Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the Premier and Minister of Interior, should be excluded, there is no doubt that Sani-ed-Dowleh’s unscrupulous use of my interview with him to enable him to escape from the difficult position into which vanity had led him produced a certain effect, and in the week during which the Ministerial cusis lasted a few speeches were made in the Assembly protesting against the “ attempt to impose foreign financial control,” and a few blustering articles to the123 same effect appeared in the press. There was talk of increasing the duties on tea and sugar, as proposed in Sani-ed-Dowleh’s scheme, whether the consent of Great Britain and Russia were acquired or no, and, again, it was gravely suggested that the nation should combine to compel our compliance by abandoning the use of those commodities, while another patriot advocated that M. Bizot should be paid his salary for the full term of his mission and allowed to return to France. All this must not, of course, be taken too seriously ; but considering that Sani-ed-Dowleh had told me himself that his decision to resign had been taken before I saw him, I thought it as well to let the facts be known in quarters where his misrepresentations might otherwise have produced a bad effect- As soon as the Cabinet was reconstructed I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and protested against the conduct of a responsible Minister in trying to drag my name into the internal affairs of the Government, and in grossly mis representing the purport of my language. Mushir-ed-Dowleh scarcely attempted to justify his colleague, but protested that no harm had been done, for Sani-ed- Dowleh’s character was so well known that no one attached much importance to his utterances 1 In this opinion I think Mushir-ed-Dowleh is right, for in the general interest excited by the last resignation of the Cabinet the momentary interest in the incident appears to have died out. In other respects, however, I hope that good results will follow. Very much as the people at large have been inclined to look upon the new form of Government as relieving them from the necessity for paying taxes, so the Assembly seems to imagine that its sovereign powers extend to foreign relations, and it is apt to overlook the fact that the observance of Treaties is not a matter of favour but of obligation. Sooner or later this erroneous idea had to be corrected, but it was a lesson which, if left to Persian Ministers to administer, might have been delayed indefinitely out of consideration for the susceptibilities ” of the Medjliss. The condition of the country is going from bad to worse, and the feeble Govern ment is absolutely unable to do anything to restore a decent degree of order, and even if money were forthcoming, it is in the last degree improbable that without foreign assistance any serious measure of reform can be undertaken. The more enlightened of the Ministers are no doubt aware of this, but the general public and the Assembly would consider it unpatriotic to admit the hard reality, and it is there fore, I think, a matter of congratulation that it should have been brought home to them by Sani-ed-Dowleh’s indiscretion that Persia must look to Great Britain and Russia to help her out of her troubles. I cannot pretend that the necessary impression has yet been produced, but at all events the first step has been taken on the way to a right understanding of the situation. Financially, the country appears to be almost at the end of its tether, and M. de Hartwig, with whom I have talked over the position, agrees with me in believing that in a very short time the straits of the Government will be such that they will be forced to make an appeal for assistance. No. 121. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received June 9.) Sir, Gulahek, May 22, 1908. IT is difficult to see anything in the events of the past four weeks that points to any immediate improvement in the condition of Persia. The object of Ministers in twice resigning was solely to get rid of the Premier, Nizam-es-Sultaneh, whose venality and unconstitutional methods had rendered him exceedingly unpopular. He seemed, moreover, to have acted towards his colleagues more as the Grand Vizier of an absolute Monarch than as the head of a constitutional Cabinet, and there is no doubt that they found it impossible to co-operate with him. It is very improbable that the new Cabinet, the construction of which is hardly yet definitely settled, will prove any more capable of restoring order in the prevailing chaos and disorganization of the Government. It seems practically certain, however, that Sani-ed-Dowleh wall become Prime Minister, and Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh, the Persian Commissioner at Urumia, is said to have been recalled to succeed Nizam-es-Sultaneh as Minister of the Interior. It seems difficult to conceive a more unfortunate choice than that of those two Ministers.124 Tehran itself remains relatively quieter, but there is a general feeling of profound depression at the helplessness of the Government, and an increasing tendency to lay the blame for the existing state of affairs on the Shah, who is again being accused of preparing another coup d' Etat. Governors have been found for most of the vacant posts, but, with the exception of Zil-es-Sultan at Shiraz and Serdar Motazid at Kerman, none of them seem to be capable of a real effort to administer their districts. At Yezd a mob of villagers has been surrounding the telegraph office by way of protest against a new tax, but Mr. Acting Vice-Consul Blackman, by a display of considerable coolness and tact, has so far succeeded in preventing any serious incident. The Government here are unable to do more than send soothing messages. Kermanshah is threatened with an incursion by the Kakavends, and Captain Haworth describes the situation as menacing. The Government promise to send Zafar-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor, with a strong force, but there is some doubt whether he will not refuse the post at the last moment. Otherwise the country is comparatively quiet, except for a few cases of brigandage, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Ispahan. X XiB/VO &amp;C (Signed) ' CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 122. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 9.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, June 9, 1908. MY telegram of yesterday’s date. Yesterday morning the town was patrolled by troops, and later a Proclamation denouncing the persons arrested as traitors was issued by the Shah. The town is as quiet as usual, and the people accepted the Proclamation passively. No. 123. Mr. Mailing to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, June 12, 1908. A RAPID development in the situation here has taken place and the excitement against the Shah is becoming very serious. M. de Hartwig, who feels great alarm for His Majesty’s safety, has suggested to M. Isvolsky at Reval by telegraph that the Russian and British Legations be instructed to make an official representation to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that the two Powers are pledged to maintain the present dynasty, and that in the event of its becoming necessary to protect the Shah by force they are prepared to do so. The view of the Russian Minister is that the present agitation is being engineered by Zil -es-Sultan, and is really fictitious; that Zil is aiming at the Regency and eventually the throne. Further, he thinks that the Ministers and Parliament are quite ready to believe that the Shah will work honestly on constitutional lines and have no real feeling against His Majesty. Personally, I am of opinion that the conviction of the Shah’s innate hostility to the Constitution is ineradicable in the popular mind. The people are anxious to be rid of him, and the Zil-es-Sultan is accepted by them as offering the best hope for a restoration of order. I must, however, admit that the Zil-es-Sultan is taking every advantage of the opportunity to further his own ends. That such a declaration as that proposed by the Russian Minister would stop the agitation in Tehran is, I think, quite possible, but it would be for a time only, and its effect would probably be merely exasperating in the provinces, and I have no faith whatever in the possibility of a permanent reconciliation between the Shah and the people being brought about by it. As the Russian Minister says, however, it is more than probable that Zil-es-Sultan would prove a far more formidable enemy than the present Shah to the Constitution. After explaining my views to the Russian Minister, I told him that, in my opinion, His Majesty’s Government would not hold themselves pledged to support the dynasty,much less an individual Sovereign, by their action in recognizing the successive heirs to the Persian Throne. No. 124. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 12, 1908. WITH reference to the telegram of to-day’s date from Tehran, Mr. Marling’s views have my entire concurrence. In discussing the situation with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs you should inform his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government consider it of the greatest importance that the policy of the two Governments should be in perfect accord, but that any action is strongly deprecated by us which mighty have the appearance of intervening in the internal affairs of Persia. His Majesty’s Govern ment are therefore unable to agree to make the communication which the Russian Minister has suggested. His Majesty’s Government ardently desire to witness the restoration of order in Persia, but the only way in which this can be accomplished is by the formation of a Government to which the Persian people will give their full confidence and support. This consummation can only be attained if the situation is allowed to develop without external interference. We are of opinion that, though the situation might be momentarily relieved by a joint declaration that the two Powers intend to maintain the present dynasty or Government, serious difficulties in the future would be thereby created both for ourselves and Russia, and that no solution would be afforded of the problem of Persian government. Any attempt to impose on them any particular form of government will undoubtedly endanger those interests. No. 125. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received June 13.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, June 13, 1908. MY telegram of the 9th instant. Apparently, at threat of the Shah to use cannon against them, the Assembly have persuaded the Enjumens to leave the mosque. There have been no disorders in the town throughout the agitation. No. 126. Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received June 15.) (Telegraphic.) Bt. Petersburgh, June 15, 1908. YOUR telegram of the 12th instant. I have as yet received no definite reply from M. Isvolsky to my communication, and his Excellency hopes that the circumstances will not necessitate an immediate decision. From his language in conversations which I have had with him, I find that he is inclined to suggest some kind of joint warning to Zil-es-Sultan, instead of a declaration of the kind proposed by M. de Hartwig, and he refers to a similar warning ofiven by the two Powers in 1907. Our recognition of the Yaliahd as successor, he argues, binds us to some extent; he contends that we are thereby laid under certain moral obligations to the Shah, though he admits that such recognition is obviously not the same thing as a pledge to maintain the Shah or his son on the throne.126 Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. (Telegraphic.) _ ^ Foreign Office, June \b, THERE are now absolutely no political relations between us and the Zil-es-Sultan, and, unless an agreement had previously been come to with Russia, we should never give our support to him or to any other candidate for the throne. I am convinced that the best course is to limit our action; otherwise we may become burdened with the responsibility of maintaining in Persia an unpopular Government which is resented by the people. Such a position would have a most unfavourable effect upon the prestige and influence in Persia of both Powers. I have given expression to these views in conversation with the Russian Ambassador, and you should make a similar communication to M. Isvolsky. No. 128. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O’Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 20, 1908. IF the Minister for Foreign Affairs considers it necessary that some action should be taken, I am ready to send instructions to His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran to join his Russian colleague in addressing to the Zil-es-Sultan a warning similar to that given last Christmas. If this action is adopted, the Representatives of the two Powers should inform the Shah of the step taken, and should advise His Majesty, in the interests of his own security on the throne, to abstain from acting in a manner hostile to the Constitutional party and the Medjliss, or at all events not to expect to be protected by either of the two Powers from any consequences which may ensue from such action.

The Russian Minister advised the Shah to adopt a conciliatory attitude, aud, in reply, His Majesty reiterated that he entertained no hostile feeling towards the Parliament. His Majesty stated that he only desired security for himself against the attacks of the press and the threats of the Enjumens, which were instigated by the Zil-es-Sultan His Majesty added that he had conclusive proof of the latter’s intrigues to dethrone him.

ABOUT 6 o’clock this morning twenty Cossacks were sent by the Shah to arrest eight persons who were in the mosque adjoining the Assembly House.

The number of people killed is said to be large. Guns are being used by the Shah’s troops. No. 133. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 23.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, June 23, 1908.

Late last night Taki Zadti, another Deputy, and five journalists, who were in fear of their lives, took “ bast ” in the Legation in town. «• About thirty prominent members of popular party, mostly members of Enjumens, and journalists, have been arrested by the Shah.

(Telegraphic.) _ , Tehran, June 25, 1908. MY immediately preceding telegram. The first shot was undoubtedly fired by the people in the mosque and Assembly, among whom some Deputies were included. I believe that every preparation had been made to clear the mosque by force if this proved necessary. In any case, the Shah had reasonable ground for taking strong measures, as the attack was made by the popular party on the troops. 17 There was no disturbance during the night of the 23rd, and the following day some shops were open and the town was orderly. The houses of one or two Notables suspected of being concerned in the agitation against the Shah were, however, attacked by the troops by the Shah’s orders. An entry was forced by gun-fire, and the troops looted the contents. Four houses have been so treated in the two days, and it is believed that others will be treated in the same way. Efforts are being made to catch Deputies, and several, including the President of the Assembly, have already been arrested. The Enjumens seem to be cowed; their supporters are falling away, and the Shah has complete mastery. \ esterday morning two prisoners were strangled at the Shah’s camp, and there are about thirty persons, other than Deputies, under arrest. There are now in the Legation fifty refugees. There has been fighting in Tabreez between the popular party and the Shah’s partisans. There is no sign from the other provinces, and the Zil-es-Sultan is trying to dissociate himself from the agitation. J &amp; Europeans do not, in my opinion, run any danger.Mi*. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received June 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, June 25, 1908. MY telegram of to-day. Yesterday afternoon the Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs came to see me at the Legation in town, bringing a message from the Shah. His Majesty expressed surprise at hearing that the Legation was encouraging people to take bast, and stated that such a proceeding was in contradiction with our known policy of non intervention. I replied that the refugees had come by no act of mine, but very much against my will, and that the reports which had reached His Majesty were quite untrue. I stated that, though I had no wish to intervene, there was a point at which abstention became inhumanity—the two executions at the Shah’s camp unhappily proving that the persons who had taken bast in the Legation had reason to fear for their lives. While doing my best to discourage others from taking refuge in the Legation, I would prevent those persons who were already there from participating in the present struggle, but that, without guarantee for a fair trial, I could not surrender those who had sought our protection, except on instructions from my Government. I stated that such a thing would not be tolerated by public opinion in England. I had received His Majesty’s solemn assurances to respect the Constitution, and the Shah’s action in arresting Deputies and attacking the Assembly looked to me very like an attempt to abolish that Constitu tion. I added that I had also heard with great regret that the death penalty had been inflicted on two of the prisoners, and I expressed the earnest hope that His Majesty would not order any more such executions. Later I paid a visit to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at whose house I found the Secretary. I repeated to his Highness the same language. The Secretary proceeded to Bagh-i-Shah, and brought the following reply from His Majesty : The Shah stated that he had been obliged to take measures to restore order in view of the state of the town. His Majesty explained that the Constitution was suspended, and administrative justice became necessary when a state of siege was declared, but that he had not forgotten his promises, which he would observe; no more executions were to take place, and the prisoners who had already been put to death had had a fair if summary trial. The ibhah, however, asked me to give him a list of our bastis. I refused, and stated that I had little faith in fairness of the alleged trial of the two persons executed. I repeated that I would do my best to discourage others from coming to take bast, but that, without instructions from His Majesty’s Government, I could not undertake to do more. While the Secretary was absent I pressed Ala-es-Sultaneh that the Shah should, in proof of his sincerity, give his prisoners a public trial, and convoke the Assembly at once. I obtained a promise from his Highness that he would urge this course upon His Majesty. He hinted that it was possible that, in order to prevent people from taking refuge in the Legation, His Majesty might station troops round it. I replied that I could not permit any but peaceful methods to be employed, and I have given Major Stokes instructions to refuse to admit all other refugees until I have received your instructions. Guards were posted near Legation gate after I left the town. No. 140. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received Jane 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran^ June 2o, 1908.

His Majesty is ready to grant to all persons in the Legation a full amnesty. He does not wish to try aiiy of them, and though he would be glad if some of them left the country, he will not make it a condition that any of them should do so. In reply, I stipulated that amnesty would require the Shah’s signature, and his Excellency, who was very emphatic that pledge would be strictly observed, undertook to furnish it. I added that if unconditional amnesty were granted, I could not undertake responsibility for any of the refugees leaving the country. The proposal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs appearing to me to fulbl the conditions laid down by you, I agreed to write a note to his Excellency, putting on record the substance of our conversation, and promised to submit his reply to you if it was satisfactory. — - - Two Proclamations of general amnesty had, so his Highness stated, been issued by the Shah, but, on the other hand, martial law has been proclaimed in all the towns of Persia. Under it every kind of public meeting is prohibited, under pain of dispersal by force and musketry; the carrying of arms is prohibited, while soldiers are authorized to use their arms to meet any disrespect shown to them. At the time of my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs I had not seen this Proclamation, and I am now informing him that it is not improbable that it may affect the views of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the “ bastis,” in view of the fact that it obviously affords the easiest of pretexts for violating the amnesty. * ' &gt; .. - - - - -- —- K 2 [ 1072 ]13*2 No. 147.

I had no objection whatever to the arrangement which I myself had made, but, on the other hand, mischief-makers had brought about such a confusion m the country that the Government and the Deputies of the Medjliss-e-Shora (National Council) could do nothing.

PLEAbE communicate to Shah Persian translation of following telegram from the Kmg to His Majesty, and give a copy to Minister for Foreign Affairs . “ ^ have received your Majesty’s telegram of 26th instant. I have no interest nor desire to intervene in any way m the internal affairs of your country, which I hope you will govern as a constitutional Sovereign with justice and humanity. Nobodyhas been invited to take refuge in ray Legation at Tehran, and although certain of your subjects have sought refuge there in fear of their lives, your Majesty is well aware that it is not the custom of your country to refuse asylum to refugees who are not guilty of crime. Those that are already in my Legation will leave on satisfactory guarantees being given. The statement in your Majesty’s telegram that my Charg&lt;5 d’Affaires has invited mischief-makers to the Legation is the direct contrary of the truth, for he has done everything consistent with the recognized customs of Persia to discourage all persons from taking refuge there. The conduct of your troops ^ in surrounding my Legation and arresting those who came out of it is an indignity which cannot be tolerated, and unless steps are immediately taken to put an end to this situation, I and mv Government will be reluctantly compelled to take measures to vindicate the honour of my flag. “ I have every confidence in the prudence and good faith of my Chargd d Affaires at Tehran. It is unfortunate that for more than two years there has been no Persian Minister in London with whom my Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs can discuss matters affecting the relations of the two countries, although I accepted in October 1906 the appointment by your Majesty of a new Persian Minister, who, I understand, is still in Berlin.” No. 160.

After due notification is given, a full and formal apology to be tendered personally at His Majesty’s Legation by the High Chamberlain and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Shah and the Persian Government respectively. Both officials to be in uniform. 3. Immediate release of all persons who have been arrested recently on their way to or from His Majesty’s Legation when engaged in ordinary business. 4.

You should present these demands to the Shah and the Persian Government, and say that they have been formulated by His Majesty’s Government, who have carefully considered the grave situation which has been created by the repeated insults at the hands of* the Shah’s troops and the police to which, during a period of several days,. His Majesty’s Legation was exposed, and against which formal protests were made by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. You should add that the restoration of the good relations which have hitherto existed between the two countries can only be effected by immediate compliance with these demands, and that if they are not accepted and fulfilled without delay His Majesty’s Government will have no alternative save to take such measures as may appear most suitable in order to obtain the reparation to which they consider themselves entitled.

In the first place the Zil should be informed of the action you are about to take in accordance with the suggestion which he himself made. You should then consult with the Russian Minister, and, in concert with him, make a representation to the Shah.

Gulahek, June 17, 19C8. IT is not easy to explain all the causes or, perhaps it would be more correct to say, to assign their relative importance to the various causes of the crisis which has agitated Persia, and especially the capital, for some days at the end of May and beginning of June. Since the 16th ultimo the country has been without a Cabinet. The disappearance from the Foreign Office of Mushir-ed Dowleh is regretted by no one. His wretched weakness resulted in a fresh outburst of popular wrath against the Shah, and a formidable agitation was started, demanding that His Majesty should dismiss from his service Amir Behadur Jang and others of his most trusted courtiers, who for that very reason are particularly obnoxious to the popular party. Late on Tuesday afternoon (the 2nd instant) the Shah yielded to the popular demands, and agreed to dismiss six of his entourage. Between 2 and 3 the next morning Amir Bahadur Jang, accompanied by some twenty of his armed gholams, arrived at the Bussian Legation at Zergendeh. The following morning, the 3rd instant, I received a visit from the Bussian Minister. M. de Hartwig said he was anxious about the Shah’s safety, while His Majesty looked on himself as practically a doomed man; he thought the position so serious that the two Legations ought to take some step. He suggested, therefore, that we should call together on Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who, though he had resigned office five days before, was still acting as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and point out to him the grave consequences which might ensue to Persia should anything happen to the Shah. I said I was quite willing to join him, but I did not think much would be gained by speaking to Mushir-ed-Dowleh alone, for he would probably give a very imperfect account of our representations, and 1 suggested that we might ask his Excellency to invite the President of the Assembly to meet us. M. de Hartwig agreed, and proposed that as Momtaz-ed-Dowleh was not much more dependable than the Minister for Foreign AMairs, the presence of Azad-ul-Mulk would be desirable. We accordingly telegraphed to Mushir-ed-Dowleh, inviting him to arrange a meeting for 3*30 that afternoon. ' ■ On reaching Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s house I found M. de Hartwig already there, but Momtaz-ed-Dowleh and Azad-ul-Mulk had both excused themselves on rather flimsy pretexts, M. de Hartwig opened the conversation by pointing out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we had come, as the Bepresentatives of the two Powers which are most concerned in Persia’s well-being, to point out the dangerous way in which Persia was being allowed to drift towards anarchy. This was a very grave prospect, and he hoped that Mushir-ed-Dowleh would make it his business to warn his colleagues and the Assembly in the most serious way of their position. Following M. de Hartwig, I said that I was quite in agreement with his view of Persia’s present situation. I thought that the real remedy lay in trying to create a better feeling between the Shah and his people, and in trying to remove the distrust which was generally entertained of His Majesty. Unfortunately, no one seemed to have the courage to lift up a voice in defence of him. The Medjliss was not a very enlightened body, and its ideas, on financial questions, for instance, were quite childish ; yet no one attempted to correct them, and it w T as just the same where the Anjumans and Shah were concerned. The most palpably improbable stories were circulated to the Shah’s discredit, and were eagerly swallowed down by an ignorant and prejudiced mob, simply because no one in authority took the trouble to contradict them. Mushir-ed-Dowleh promised to represent faithfully what we had said to his colleagues and to the Assembly. On taking leave, M. de Hartwig said he thought Mushir-ed-Dowleh would probably not give a very accurate account of what we had wished to convey, and it would be prudent that we should call on Azad-ul-Mulk to make a similar statement to him. Having an appointment with Mr. Babino, I was unable to proceed at once to Azad-ul- Mulk’s house, but I followed M. de Hartwig there as soon as possible, and w~e spoke to him very much in the same strain as to Mushir-ed-Dowletn 1 have reason to believe that Mushir-ed-Dowleh did inform the President of the Assembly accurately of the purport of our visit, and I took steps to let it be knoYm toan honest and fearless Deputy, who would give a correct account of our language. ^ I cannot say, however, that it produced any beneficial result in the direction ol bringing about concord between the two parties. The following morning (4th instant), on reaching Gulahek after an early visit to Tehran on private affairs, I received about 11 o’clock a telephone message from the Medjliss stating that the Shah had left the “Ark” about 10 o’clock for an unknown destination. It appears that about 9'50 a.m. a quarrel between some of the Palace guards was got up at the gate near the customs office, and the cry was at once raised that the town was to be looted. Parties of soldiers were sent galloping through the town in every direction, and in the confusion which followed the Shah, surrounded by a strong guard of troops, and with Colonel Liakhoff and M. Chapchal by the side of the carriage, drove off to Bagh Shah on the west side of the city. Order was restored as soon as it was known where His Majesty had gone, but great uneasiness was felt. As soon as the news reached me I went to the Russian Legation at Zergendeh, and, finding that M. de Hartwig had gone to the German Legation, I awaited his return. On his arrival he said he had received the news by telephone a little after 10 o’clock. He was pleased at the turn matters had taken, as he thought the Shah was far safer at Bagh Shah than hemmed in in the centre of the city, and he hoped His Majesty would soon move up to Niaveran at the foot of the mountains. Tehran remained perfectly quiet; Cossacks patrolled the streets, and the bazaars, which had been closed when the Shah’s disappearance became known, reopened by midday. Great uneasiness prevailed, however, as to what His Majesty’s next move might be, while the uncertainty of the issue of the frontier question added to the difficulties and apprehensions of the provisional Government. During the next two days pourparlers between the Court, the Ministers, the Princes, and Notables followed in rapid succession, and on Saturday afternoon (6th instant) the Minister for Foreign Adairs called at the Russian Minister’s, where, after a long interview about the frontier question, he had a conversation with Amir Behadur Jang, with the result that the latter left the Legation the following morning. M. de Hartwig informed me that Mushir-ed-Dowleh had given him satisfactory assurances as to Amir Behadur Jang’s personal safety, and there was therefore no reason why he should stay any longer under the Russian flag. Amir Behadur Jang returned at once to the Palace. On the afternoon of the 7th June the Cabinet was finally constituted, and the new Ministers attended the Assembly, but as the ceremony of their introduction took place with closed doors, the fact that a Ministry had been formed was not at once generally known. Late in the evening Hormuz Mirza arrived at Gulahek and informed me that his brother, Jelal-ed-Dowleh, Ala-ed-Dowleh ,Serdar Mansur, and Azad-ul-Mulk had been arrested by the Shah, and half-an-hour later another visitor came to tell me the same news, adding also that the three former prisoners had been put in chains and were being treated with every indignity. Both my visitors inquired whether I would take any steps to obtain Jelal-ed-Dowleh’s release, such as I had taken in favour of Nasr- ul-Mulk. I said the cases were quite different, and there was no possible ground on which I could interfere on Jelal-ed-Dowleh’s behalf, and all the more so as it was notorious that he had taken a leading part in the recent agitation. In any case, there was no reason to believe that his life was in danger, and, as a matter of fact, Hormuz Mirza at first treated his brother’s arrest as a joke. Both these gentlemen hinted at the possibility of the Legation in town being invaded by refugees, and inquired what my attitude would be. I sent two trustworthy gholams to town early the following morning to shut the gates of the Legation and remain on duty there, and warn me by telephone in case any attempt to resort to “bast” was made. Subsequently it transpired that the Shah had sent a summons to Ala-ed-Dowleh, Jelal-ed-Dowleh, Serdar Mansur, and some others to come to the Palace. At first there had been a disposition to decline to obey, but on Azad-ul-Mulk’s stating that he would guarantee their safety, in consequence of a reassuring letter addressed to him by the Shah, they at last complied. They were escorted by troops to Bagh Shah, where the three whom the Shah believed to have been the leaders of the agitation for the dismissal of the courtiers were placed under arrest. Azad-ul-Mulk pleaded in vain for them, and declared that he would share the fate of the prisoners. He therefore remained at the Palace. The story that the prisoners were ill-treated either at Bagh Shah or later on their journey to Mazanderan appears to be quite untrue.There can be no question but that the Shah’s suspicions of Ala-ed-Dowleh and Jelal-ed-Dowleh were perfectly justified, but the arrest of Serdar Mansur came as a general surprise. He has been for the past year the Chief Administrator of Telegraphs, and was supposed to take no part in politics. M. de Hartwig informed me that he could form no guess why he was included with the other two. I told the Minister that as Serdar Mansur held an English decoration I should feel bound to make an inquiry as to the reason of his disgrace, but I did not propose for the present to press my inquiry in such away as to amount to intervention on his behalf. from what I nave been able to extract from Ala-es-Sultaneh, it would seem that he had taken a considerable part in the conclaves at Azad-ul-Mulk’s house, that the fact Hat he had been one of the first to arrive had convinced the Shah that lie was the prime mover in the plot.^ In Persian eyes member ship of an order would, of course, amply justify me in pressing for an inquiry into his guilt, but as this would have been interpreted as a step taken to obtain ins release, I have thought it better to abstain from taking action which would wear the appearance of intervention in an internal matter. I propose, however, to let Ala-es-bultaneh under stand that I shall expect to be satisfied as to the Serdar’s guilt. _ Another period of negotiation followed, during which rumours of a most conflicting kind were current. The Anjumans appeared to be m doubt as to the wisdom ot continuing the struggle, and the Medjliss and the Ministers were obviously anxious to avoid bringing matters to a climax. On Wednesday morning (the 10 th instant), however, the Anjumans began to rally to their old meeting-place at the Sepahsalar Mosque, and, with a strong picket camped day and night in the Cannon Square, it seemed for a time as though the scenes of December were to be. repeated. But the town remained quiet, though the bazaars were once or twice closed temporal ily, and the attempts which the Shah’s patrols had made to disarm peisons cauying rifles had been discontinued. At Bagh bhah, which is guarded by a continuous line of sentries, and where there is a strong body of troops supported by a couple of field guns, the Shah seemed equally irresolute. It was said that he was demanding t ie arrest and trial of the most prominent popular leaders, such as Taki Zade, Malek-ul- Mutakkelemin, Mutashar-ed-I)owleh, and Seyed Jemal; while, on the other hand, the Aniumans contemplated requiring that the Ala-ed-Dowleh and his two companions, who had been sent away under a strong escort to Mazanderan, should be brought back to Tehran and put on their trial. t m ^ « tv +1 r 4 .» By midday on Friday (the 12th instant), however, the Shah sent a Dastkhat (Rescript) by the hand of an officer accompanied by thirty soldiers to the Assembly and Ministers that, unless the gathering at the mosque dispersed, he would compel them to do so by force. The threat, though it would never have been carried out, was sufficient. After a short debate with the doors of the House closed, a small party of the Members, headed by the President, repaired to the mosque, where they requested the people to go to their homes. The President’s speech was followed by one from Taki Zade, in which the great leader besought the people to comply, and not to ask the reasons why he thought compliance necessary. The appeal was obeyed in silence, and the Anjumans proceeded to leave the mosque, carrying away with them the great placard which had been hung up setting forth twelve individual instances in which the bhah had violated his oath ”0 observe the Constitution. Ala-es-bultaneh, who came to see me in the afternoon, seemed much delighted with the results achieved, and thought that for the time beincr a settlement had been patched up. There was deep dejection on the popular side who°felt that the Medjliss had betrayed the cause. The advice of the Medjliss was’ however, probably sound, for the Shah could well aver that the assemblage of a large number of armed men was a danger to the public security, if not to his own person and that he would be justified in dispersing it by force, while by peaceably returning to their homes the people have left him without any pretext for doing so. But it was soon realized that the Shah’s apparent victory was a hollow one, and by Sunday mornino- (the 14th instant) the bazaars and shops were again closed, in token that the battle was not over, and He leaders of the popular movement were considering how to carry on the struggle by peaceable and constitutional means. I he bhah appeared to have hardened his heart and to be ready to take extreme measures. He obtained a large sum of money (10,000/.) from the Muhkber-ed-Dowleh, and wit 1 attempted to secure the fidelity of the troops by giving the men and officers large extra pay—4 krans to the privates and 5 to 10 tomans to the officers pei diem. He be era n also to recruit a further force among the lower classes of the city, and Bag Shah was converted into a regular armed camp. But no further arrests were ma e until Monday (the lath instant), when the President of the Anjuman of the Brotheis o the Kazvin Gate—Suleiman Khan—and another leading member were captured; theformer, who is an official of* the War Department, is charged with having allowed rifles and arms to be removed from the arsenal, and, it is said, was to be handed over to the Government for trial. Meantime, the leaders of the popular party had decided on their course of action, and requested the Shah to receive a deputation of six members of the Medjliss, who were to present a Memorial to His Majesty recalling the various oaths he had taken to observe the Constitution, and calling on His Majesty to work harmoniously with the Assembly, for otherwise the representatives of the nation could no longer perform their duties to the country. The Shah, however, declined to receive the deputation till iuesday (16th June) in the afternoon, when, having himself read the Memorial aloud, he replied that he could not give a definite answer at the moment, but he reminded his auditors that the Kajars had taken Persia by the sword and he meant to hold it by the sword. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I saw on the afternoon of the 16th June, and who spoke with a frankness very unusual for him, said that he regarded the situation as exceedingly grave. Telegrams were coming in from all parts of the country denouncing the Shah, and yet nothing that the Ministers could say would persuade His Majesty of the danger of pursuing his present course. I said that, in my opinion, the Shah would have put himself in a much stronger position if’ after arresting Ala-ed-Dowleh and his two companions, he had handed them over to the Ministry of Justice for trial. Perhaps it would not be too late to do so even now. It would be a material proof of His Majesty’s professed wish to act constitutionally, and he had, by making the arrests, shown that he was strong enough to defend himself. Ala-es-Sultaneh said the Ministers had used every argument to induce His Majesty to do as I suggested, but in vain. Could I not find some means of conveying the same advice to the Palace? I said I would turn the matter over in my ramd and see if anything could be done. During the past week I have received several telegrams from the provincial towns imploring the Legation to come to the assistance of the constitutional cause, which owed its birth to the sympathy and countenance of Great Britain. I have made no direct reply to any of the messages, but in one or two instances, when it seemed that a message from the Legation might have a soothing effect, I have instructed His Majesty’s Consul that’if he were asked to obtain an answer he might say that England, as a consti tutional country, must always look with sympathy on a constitutional movement; but that it was not fitting or right that she should interfere in the internal aflhirs of a free and independent people. In any case, Persia could be assured that England’s friendship tor Persia was as strong as ever. No. 176.

Kerman, too, so I ain informed by'’ he Acting Superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was recently foi a da? the scene of party fighting but as His Majesty's Consul has not made any report on thl subject I presume that nothing serious has occurred. ^ P at Yezd forsomethin^rL^th 8 ” I ? do - E . uro P ean Telegraph Department’s office at lezd foi something like three weeks has given me considerable anxiety for the ffinatical crowd can work itself to such a pitch of frenzy that, as actually occurred at Yezd, two or three persons committed suicide, and a catastrophe might have occurred at any moment. It was, moreover, difficult for the Persian Government to give way for he peasants were agitating for the abolition of a tax which has been regulf rly paid for the last eighty years—a wholly unjustifiable demand. S y PAlthough the Shah, hy closing the Tehran telegraph offices, has clone his best to prevent news 'of what is going on here from getting abroad, he has only^ partially succeeded, and events at the capital are being closely watched from the provinces. A good deal of excitement has been aroused, and telegrams have been received from most of the larger towns promising armed support to the popular party. It is, however, very difficult to say exactly what 'value must be attached to these messages, or how far they represent public opinion. Tor my own part, I doubt much whether moi e than loui towns, e.g. } Hesht, Kazvin, Tabreez, and Ispahan, would really send a contingent, unless indeed the Shah committed the extreme folly of actually attacking the Medjliss itself and it is probable that many of the telegrams that have so greatly impressed the Shah have been dispatched by hare-brained “ patriots' calling themselves the local Anjumarr I do not mean to imply that there is no danger to the Shah in this ; it is a question of proportion, for if those who clamour for the Shah’s deposition are few in number, those who would voluntarily lift a finger to save him are fewer still. The mass of the popu lation are, I think, really indifferent, and only desire to see a Government formed that would afford reasonable security, but if they should be persuaded that under the present Shah such Government were impossible they might easily be roused to jom m the outcry for his removal. In the capital, however, it is different. There is m lehian a considerable number of men who expect they know not Avhat benefits from the Con stitution and who are firmly convinced that under Mohammed Ali their hopes can never be’realized. These men, ignorant as they are, are sincere enough, and among them are found the leaders of the more important Anjumans. And it is the Aniumans who dominate the situation ; the larger are honest enough, but very many of the smaller ones have been formed simply to forward their own private interests. Unfortunately, all the Anjumans suffer from the vice of meddlesomeness, and as their interference is usually accompanied by threats—which, it is true, a little courage would enable their victims to disregard—Government has become practicady impossible. But Persian Ministers, at least those who have been in office in the last eight months, have, to their country’s misfortune, lacked even the small dose of courage necessary, with’the result that the arrogance of the Anjumans has been encouraged to such a point that they have practically usurped the representative charactar ot the Medjhss In fact, Persia was fast drifting into a state of government by the semi-secret and wholly irresponsible political Societies of Tehran. It is not that the influence of the Aniumans is wholly bad ; on the contrary, they have been, and still are, the one support of the Parliament against the reactionaries, but having realized thenypower they have too often abused it; sometimes, but not often in important matters, wittingly, but most frequently out of sheer ignorance.

On the 17th May representatives of various political clubs took refuge at the meeting place of the local Assembly in order to obtain reforms in the election of that body, security of the highways, punishment of those who spoke against the Constitution, the establishment of a Court of Justice, and the abolition of the custom of taking sanctuary at mosques and priests’ houses. The Governor and local Assembly after some discussion agreed to these requests, and on the 22nd May the refugees left the Assembly building. The agitation was aimed at Agha Nejefi who is a reactionary, and his agreement with the above reforms was obtained in writing. On the 28th May, 500 villagers from Behnan, near Ispahan, took refuge in the British Consulate, complaining of excessive taxation. Agha JSejefi pursuaded them to leave the Consulate, but encouraged them to refuse to pay as long as the Governor threatened to send artillery to their villages. The Ispahan post was roboed near larq on the 19th May. 400 sheep were carried off on the 1st June from near Kumeshah. Yezd. On the 22nd May the villagers returned to the telegraph office demanding sanctuary. On the 20th May two of them had thrown petroleum over and set themselves°on fire, and three had thrown themselves from a minaret, one being killed. A telegram from the Finance Minister offering partial remission of taxation was rejected. On the 24th May, no reply having come from the Assembly, the crowd broke into the telegraph office. On the 26th May the President of the Assembly telegraphed to the whole of the priests at Yezd upbraiding them for allowing an appeal to foreigners, and instructing them to get the crowd away from the office. The crowd, however, remained. On the 29th May some ol the crowd left, but the leaders and the majority remained. On the 30th May more villagers came in and three tents were pitched. On the 3rd June a section of the crowd wished to detain the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, whom they met in the^street, as a hostage, but were dissuaded. A message from His Majesty’s Chargd d Affaires that the Ministers were taking action was received in silence, the crowd ^ ie P^ the Assembly. On the 4th June a message from the Charge d Affaires that the Assembly had decided not to collect the tax calmed the crowd. On the 6th June the crowd was only with difficulty persuaded by its leaders to allow the te.egraph office to be opened, and the Parsees were compelled to join the acdtatioii, which continued unabated. The Governor was powerless, but wished to seize” certain of the agitators who had closed the shops which he had ordered to be opened As these men were in the telegraph office Mr. Blackman persuaded him not to make the attempt as bloodshed was likely to occur. The Imperial Bank remained closed, as its opening vas likely to cause trouble^ On the 10th June telegrams from the President o± the Assembly and the Finance Minister were received ordering the collection of taxes to be held m abeyance until the arrival of a Commission of Inquiry. The leader of the ciowd sent his thanks to the Chargd d Affaires. The next day the crowd diminished, but theie being some doubt of the authenticity of the telegrams received, some remained. On the 12th June the leader still remained in the office though all the crowd had left. ° • Kermctnshah, The whole district of Kermanslmh was throughout May in a Very disturbed condition, owing to the tribes who were occupied with either robbing travellers orfighting among themselves. The Zafar-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor, had not arrived and the town remained in disorder. Trade was at a standstill. (Signed) C. B. STOKES, Major. No. 178.

WITH reference to my telegram of the 3rd instant, I have the honour to state that I had a satisfactory interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday regarding affairs at Tehran. His Excellency read over and handed to me an aidc-rne'moirc, stating that immediately upon my asking for the co operation of the Imperial Government to the demands which His Majesty’s Government are making upon the Persian Government, instructions were telegraphed to the Kussian Minister to give the strongest support to Mr. Mailing’s representations. The Hussian Government, it proceeds to say, thanks you for your assurances in regard to the policy followed by His Majesty’s Government in the Persian crisis. For their part, the Russian Government declare that they remain faithful to the entente between the two Governments respecting Persia, and to the non-intervention in Persia’s internal affairs. Renewed instructions have been sent to M. de Hartwig enjoining on Russian Agents at Tehran to observe the most friendly attitude towards the British Legation. I thanked his Excellency for this communication, which, I said, would, I was sure, be received with great gratification by His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c, (Signed) HUGH O’BEIRNE. No. 179. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received July 6.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 5, 1908. ALL demands of His Majesty’s Government will be accepted by the Shah, but His Majesty desires with regard to demand No. 4 that a few of the bastis should leave the country. Number would not exceed three or four. Compliance with His Majesty’s wishes would, I venture to think, tend to remove possible causes of difficulty in the future. Period of absence of these persons from Persia should, however, I think, be limited to, say, one year; a stipulation should also be made that, so long as he abstains from agitation against the Shah, any one returning after such a period shall not be molested. Those who return before expiration of period would of course do so at their own risk. Refugees would be condemned to exile for life unless a definite period is fixed on. Some of the refugees may possibly refuse to accept the terms eventually agreed upon between the two Governments, and may decline to leave in order to use His Majesty’s Legation as a political lever. To surrender to the Persian Government would produce an impression most unfavourable to us in Persia, and I should be glad of instructions as to what I should do. Text of apology will be submitted to me for my approval by Minister for Foreign Affairs. If you see no objection, I should be glad to comply with His Highness’desire that he and Shah’s Representative should make apologies separately.

Your proposal that in the case of a refugee leaving the country the period of his expatriation should be definitely limited is accepted by His Majesty’s Government, as also the stipulation that so long as he does not take part in agitation such refugee should, on his return, be free from molestation. We might concede a longer term if the period of one year is insufficient. You should inform any of the refugees who may refuse to leave the Legation that they cannot be allowed to remain, but that a safe conduct will he obtained for them to leave the country.

DEMANDS of His Majesty’s Government. lieferring to my telegram of the 7th instant, Minister for Foreign Affairs has sent me a note, modified in the manner I suggested, which accepts the demands of His Majesty’s Government.

THIS morning Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of Persian Government, and Minister of Court, on behalf of the Shah, tendered formal apology in the terms which I had approved.

A verbal message from the Shah that the terms would be strictly observed was also communicated to me by the Minister of the Court. No. 191. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.— [Received July 11.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 11, 1908. LEGATION bastis. The Shah has just sent me a message in which His Majesty expresses the desire, firstly, that a period of exile varying from five to ten ^ears be fixed in the cases of six of the bastis; secondly, that four others should go to their own homes and not come back to Tehran; thirdly, His Majesty will keep a strict watch on all who leave the Legation, in order to see that they take no part in any agitation against His Majesty. The Shah’s message is, in my opinion, most unsatisfactory. With regard to the first part, I had till yesterday refused to give a list of the refugees in the Legation, fearing that if their names were known vengeance might be taken by the Shah’s party on their families and property. On the 7th instant, however, an Ispahan Deputy, who left the Legation of his own accord, was received by the Shah and gave him the names of all the more important bastis. The Shah now proposes long exile for six persons, while I have been led to believe all through the negotiations that three or at most four persons would be required to go out of the country for at most six or eight months. As regards the second part of His Majesty’s message, which is a new demand, two of the persons concerned live in Karadji Dagh, the country of the unscrupulous Amir Behadur Jang, where his authority and powei is undisputed. ? The bastis aie, as it is, showing great unwillingness to leave the Legation, and if the third part of the message were communicated'to them they would all decline to go. I asked Meftah-es-Sultaneh, who brought me His Majesty’s message, to inform the Shah that a complete amnesty for all the bastis had been one of His Majesty’s Governments demands, and that merely to give time for the present excitement to subside they had consented to His Majesty s request that three or four should leave the country for a short period. Further, I expressed my conviction that these additional conditions proposed by the Shah, one of which implied punishing some of the peisons to whom an amnesty had been granted with exile, would never be agreed to tjJ His Majesty’s Government; that the Shah’s message, more especially the third^ pait, coming as it did on the assurances given by the Minister of Court this morning, and on the warning 'which I had conveyed in accepting the apology that6ur other demands must be scrupulously observed, would produce a most unfortunate impression. As regards the first part, I venture to suggest that I be authorized to inform the Shah through the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the limit of absence from Persia will be one year; that His Majesty’s Government cannot accept the second part; and that the second and third parts together constitute an excuse for nullifying the effect of the amnesty. No. 192. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 13,J (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 13, 1908. I HAVE received a message from the Shah that His Majesty modifies his conditions in regard to the bastis. For Taki Zad4 and a popular orator the period of absence is reduced to one and a-half years, and for three others to one year. The sixth refugee is now omitted from the list ; he is, however, ready to go to Europe voluntarily. No alteration is made in the second conditions, but with regard to the third the Shah renews assurances of his intention to fulfil his engagements. I think that in the circumstances I can continue to urge the refugees to leave the Legation, but they still show the greatest reluctance to go. Some may possibly absolutely refuse. Should I be justified in ejecting them? Two persons have been released under No. 3 of our demands. Serdar Mansur is to be sent to Khorassan, and Jelal-ed-Dowleh and Ala-ed* Dowleh proceed to Europe. The persons in refuge in the French Legation have gone. General apprehension continues in spite of these reassuring signs, and people who are under the impression that their lives are in danger are constantly saying that they wish to come to Gulahek. I am in hopes of being able to prevent them from doing this. No. 193. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, July 13, 1908 s REFUGEES at Legation. With reference to your telegrams of the 11th and 13th instant. First point, I understand that the period of absence from the country h&amp;S been adjusted in a satisfactory manner ; second point, it is not possible to raise an objection to requirement that four of the refugees shall proceed to their own homes ; nor to the third point, the adoption of precautions to insure that “ bastis ’ do nothing against the existing Government whilst remaining under guarantee in Persia. It is impossible for us to ask for better terms than these. We do not wish to intervene in Persian internal affairs, and it must therefore be understood that refuge was only granted in Legation in order to save life, and not to lend assistance to any political enterprise. The protection which we have secured must be dependent on subsequent peaceable behaviour on part of refugees. You should give the above explanation to the “bastis,” but you should not employ force to oblige them to leave. I presume that when they know that these terms are final they will not remain indefinitely. The Shah should be informed, on the other hand, that the refugees must remain unmolested in Persia as long as their behaviour continues peaceable.150 No. 194. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. (Telegraph 1c.) Foreign Office, July 13, 1908. REFUGEES at Legation. With reference to your telegram of the 13th instant. When asylum has once been sought it is not possible for us to guarantee subsequently anything more than a safe conduct to the frontier, and protection can only be given when there is imminent danger to life. This must be clearly understood. Unless we adhere to the above limitation, leaders of any political party may, when affairs are going adversely, use our Legation as a refuge in order that when more favourable opportunity presents itself they may be enabled to renew operations. Our policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Persia would be quite incompatible with the position in which we should then be placed. No. 195.

He would then travel north, avoiding Tehran, and leave the country by that route. I think that if ZiLes-Sultan remains at Ispahan the restoration of tranquillity in the country will be rendered more difficult, and the Russian Minister shares this opinion.

Without forcibly expelling those “bastis” whose motives in taking refuge were of a purely political nature, and who refuse to leave, you should endeavour to convince them that there is nothing more to be gained by remaining, and that they had better go.

It is stated by a member of the Tribunal formed to try the prisoners at Bagh-i- Shah that the chief object of the inquiries is to find out who was concerned in the attempt on the life of the Shah, and a considerable number of arrests have been made m the process. Of the persons thus carried to Bagh-i-Shah, the great majority after giving evidence are probably released, but a feeling of insecurity is produced by the constant visits of troops to private houses, and people who consider that they have cause for fear quietly take refuge at Gulahek. I see no way of preventing them from coming, nor any ground for sending them away so long as they continue orderlv. A gieat number are camped in a large garden lent to them, or staying with friends. They no not appear to come with any political object, but merely out of fear of arrest, which is genuine even if to a very large extent unfounded. It seems likely, however, that eu numbers will increase, and eventually they may try to bring pressure to bear on us, but at present there is no sign of it, and the likelihood seems to be passing away ot a large number of refugees from the bazaars. ° J T 1 t^? ^ ncreas ^ n l? numbers should threaten the sanitary condition of the village I should, I presume, be justified in refusing to receive any more who may arrive, and i ®hall expel as trespassers any persons in the village who may make an attempt to enter the grounds of His Majesty’s Legation. * ^ ^ ™ to Gidahek^ ^ ^ 0nG ^ ^ 1&gt;ei ’ siari Govem ment to prevent persons from coming No. 205.

Beports of the events in Tehran were received during the day, and fighting commenced between the Shah’s partisans, headed by the priests, and the Constitutionalists. The bazaars remained closed during the three following days, and fighting continued until, on the 2/ th, both sides agreed to meet to discuss terms of peace. The appointment was not kept by the Shah’s party, who were accused by the Constitutionalists of having killed and mutilated two Constitutionalists. One mutilated body was brought to His Majesty s Consulate in proof of the barbarity of reactionary methods, and was afterwards placed m a mosque. In revenge the Constitutionalists killed the brother of the chief' pi lest, who had been taken prisoner by them.

I HAVE the honour to submit the fell • ti Gulahek, July 15, 1908. narrative of events connected with the recent round’ m COI ' tl . uuatlon of the of the 18th June. 1 P d hlat 0 o mm eueed m my despatch up i little^rSvhT^SVsremfiTe^oS anxio'^T 16 ” 8 aPPeiU ' ed t0 be P luckingpourparlers passed between the Ministers and the Assembly on the one hand, and the Court at Bagh-i-Shah on the other. Debate on the demands put forward by the Court was very prolonged, and the Medjliss sat till a late hour before they were finally rejected. There seems to be little doubt that this result had been foreseen at Bagh-i-Shah, for ample preparations must have been made for the operations of the following day. The accounts of the events of Tuesday, the 23rd June, are even more conflicting than usual in Persia. They concur in asserting that the leaders, and in particular Seyyid Abdullah, had enjoined on the party to act strictly on the defensive, and that the first shot was fired by a soldier, possibly in the air, and that it was only after this that the Enjumens fired on the troops. The point, however, is of little real importance, as it was clear that the Shah had decided to appeal to force. _ I think there can be little doubt that the Russian officers were purposely never fired on. Persians all say that special injunctions were issued to^ that effect, and ‘M. de Hartwig volunteered to me the statement that such was the impression of one Russian officer. Were it otherwise it seems incredible, considering the short range and excellent cover which the popular party enjoyed, that they should have escaped. All, moreover, exposed themselves fearlessly throughout the day, and a Persian Deputy has told me that Colonel Liakhoff* in particular could have been killed at almost any moment. Had they been killed I think it unquestionable that the struggle would have ended quite differently; but they owed their lives to the general conviction that their death would bring about Russian intervention. As it was they succeded in keeping their men on the whole under wonderfully good restraint, for very few shops and scarcely any private houses, except those marked down for plunder, i.e., those of Zil-es-Sultan and Banou Ozma, were touched, and they undoubtedly prevented the Persian regiment of Silakhoris and Amir Behadur Jangs guard from committing the grossest excesses. t # I received the first news of the struggle going on in Tehran rather belore 7 and a couple of hours later went across to Zerguendeh to see M. de Hartwig, who had, he said, received much the same news as myself, but argued that till we knew wit more certainty what was going on we could not decide what to do. I called again at 12, and he agreed to send our dragomans down to Tehran to point out to the Shah the danger in which Europeans were placed. When I called, about 3 he agreed that, in addition to urging that steps should be taken for the maintenance of security dm mg the night, our dragomans should remind the Shah of his assurances to lespect the Constitution. . . .. . M. de Hartwig sent to summon M. Baranowsky to give him his instructions, ana told him what we had agreed on. I told M. de Hartwig that I should give Mr. Ghurc n written instructions. M. de Hartwig agreed that Mr. Churchill and M. Baranowsky should meet at His Majesty’s Legation at 5 r.M. M. Baranowsky did not, however, put in an appearance till close on 6 o’clock. . On the way from the Legation to Bagh-i-Shah Mr. Churchill showed the instruc tions I had given him to M. Baranowsky, who, as representing the senior Mission, was to act as spokesman, and who gave a faithful translation to the Shah. His Impel la Majesty gave every promise that no pillaging or disorders should take place, and orders were given also for the protection of the Imperial Bank of Persia and of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s quarters, and for the safe escort of the cleiks going to and from the Central Office on duty. _ . I inclose a memorandum by Mr. Churchill, giving an account of the audience at ^ Soon after receiving news of the events in town I sent Major Stokes to town with instructions to see that no one should take refuge in the Legation unless m imminent danger of his life, and from time to time he sent me telephone messages of what was happening. His reports showed that a good deal of looting must be going on, as he saw soldiers, both of the Cossack Brigade and the Persian Silakhor Regiment, returning in the direction of Bagh-i-Shah laden with plunder of the most varied description, even the gun-carriages being piled high with booty, while, at a moment when he was actually using the telephone of a shop within a few yards of the Legation gates four men of Amir Behadur’s guard attempted to enter for purposes of plunder. As a matter of fact, however, comparatively few shops and private houses were pillaged, and most of the loot came from the huge Palace of Zil-es-Sultan and from t e Medpiss building. The exterior of the former suffered but little, for Dr. Neligan, who, went into Tehran to offer his services to the wounded, passed the gate, and though15G that was soniewhat battered, he came away believing that the building within had been respected. During the afternoon a considerable number of arrests were made among all classes of the population. The only names worth mentioning are those of the two great Mujteheds, Seyyid Abdullah and Seyyid Mohammed, Sheikh-ur-Reis, Musteshar-ed- Dowleh, the prominent reform leader and Deputy for Tabreez, the popular orator, Malek- el-Mutakilimin, and Jehangir Khan, editor of the “ Sur-i-Israfil,” both of whom have been particularly obnoxious to the Shah from their unrestrained and frequently insulting and scurrilous attacks on His Majesty. '1 hero was no disturbance during the night, but early the next morning I received a hasty note from Major Stokes stating that Taki Zade and six friends, including the editors of the “ Habl-ul-Matin,” a paper which has distinguished itself by the virulence of its attacks on England, and of the “ Musavat,” had sought refuge at the Legation during the night. I will not stop here to give any details. My note informing M. de Hartwig of what had occurred crossed one from him to me stating that several members of Enjumens were going to the Legation to take bast, and that merchants and Seyyids in hired carriages, accompanied by Legation i°i T\ l r S b W Tj e P roceec ^ n &amp; thither. I at once went to the Russian Legatioli and told M. de Hartwig that I knew as yet nothing of the circumstances under which Taki Zade and the others had been admitted, that I had sent down Major Stokes purposely to prevent the refugees coming into the Legation, and that I was convinced that he would conscientiously carry out the general instructions from His Majesty’s Government on the subject of bast, namely, that the Legation was to do everything to discourage it, and to admit no one except those in imminent danger. It was, of course, just possible that he might make an error of judgment, but I did not think it likely. woUxd go to Tehran at once myself, and would let him know what had occurred as soon as I could. I was quite confident that the story of the Legation gholams escorting refugees was quite untrue, and I had telephoned at once to Major Stokes absolutely to refuse all admittance. &lt; ^ n retu rn to the Legation I found a telephone message from town stating that some forty-three or forty-four persons had gained admittance that morning. On reaching Tehran about 2 o’clock I found that the feeling of general insecurity produced by the events of the day before had, if anything, been increased by the exaggerated stones of the raids of the Cossacks on private houses in search of suspects, whilst the news of the execution of two of the prisoners at Bagh-i-Shah had been magnified into tales of wnolesale slaughter. Most of the shops, it is true, were open, but only in consequence of a Proclamation from the Shah that those who remained closed would he plundeied by the soldiery. Very few people were moving about the town, but stood. do next C 0 ° rS ^ Sh0P3 anXi0Usl y and fearfull y speculating on what the Shah might „,,vA bo y 3 t 3 ° Muin-ul-Vezareh, the Foreign Minister’s son and “ Chef de.

The substance of the message the 25th June Plj and ^ Shahs answer ' el ' e re P or ^‘l fully in my telegram No. 155 of While we were speaking we heard the sound of rifle fire and, a few minuies later, that the n tmnn m w shor t dl f. an ^ °f the Legation, and Muin-ul-Vezareh explained he head nnX, f -£ Ckmg the h °T °, f Zahi ™d-Dowleh which had served ns eacl-quurteis of an Enjumen generally known by the same name.

There I again found Muin-ul-Vezareh, and, after I had repeated to him in his father’s nresencell e message I desired to be conveyed to the Shah, he left for Bagh-i-Shah. in returning to the Legation I noticed three or four mounted soldiers nosted across the road some 25 or 30 yards from the Legation on either side of the gateway but, thinking id might be accidental, attached no particular importance to it I am giving in another despatch a detailed account oi the military surveillance of the meS^nUnthis de^ateh. 6 there,bl ' e &gt; aS fer as P ossibk &gt; ad on tlfe r0 26th he it 1U w!lfb transla t ion °f y® p^amation of Martial Law which appeared on the 26 th it will be seen that Colonel Liakhoflf was appointed Governor-General, with full powers over the police and military forces. ' Colonel Liakhoflf undoubtedly used the authority vested in him to good effect for Tehran has not been so quiet by day and by night ter the past six or^even mcnths!But in another respect the Proclamation defeated its own ends by the very rigour of its terms, Article 5, in particular, providing that in cases of disrespect (the Persian word employed implies no more) to the military soldiers are authorized to use their arms, produced the worst effect. The people were terrified, for they felt that they were put at the mercy of any one who had a grudge to pay off, and it is this clause which has driven so many persons who were in no real danger whatever to seek asylum at the Legation. The town was quiet because it was cowed. t ^ Meantime a Proclamation of general amnesty also appeared, I believe, on the 25th, hut in spite of it arrests have been, and still are, constantly made. In lact, it has been looked on merely as intended to lure suspects from their hiding places. On Monday, the 29th, a Proclamation, signed by Colonel Liakhoff himself, was posted up all over the town. It was superseded only on the Gth July by a motion signed by Mush ir-es-Sultan eh, the Prime Minister, explaining that Prince Moayed-edy Dowleh was Civil Governor and Colonel Liakhoff Military Governor. Translations of both these documents are inclosed. On the 7th July a further Proclamation was issued by Prince Moayed-ed-Dowieh, dated the 5th July, in which it is stated that, though it is necessary to continue military law in the town, the Civil Government would be carried on by him, and inviting all persons having civil suits to refer to him within certain hours. It is fuithei explained that the former prohibition as to gatherings does not prevent people going to the mosques to pray. _ , The following dav a Rescript addressed by the Shah to the Prime Mmistei was placarded about the town ordering him to concert measures of reform with his colleagues with special reference to education, the fostering of commerce, and the institution of factories. The Rescript also orders that the Finance Department should immediately investigate all claims for arrears of Government salaries or pensions with a view to then settlement. . , xl -n • , i The object of the last paragraph was evidently to secure the adhesion ot the vast numbers of pension holders, whose pensions had been suppressed by the Medjliss. There is, of course, no money to meet the immense claims which the Treasury would have to satisfy. c ^i i • Except on the 9th July, when a tea house, the property of one ot the bastis in the Legation, from which it is alleged a bomb was thrown on the 23rd, was wrecked by the troops, no measure of vengeance has been taken, though a consideiable number of arrests have been made, and I believe that a very active search for arms has been m &amp; It is very difficult to ascertain how the prisoners at Bagh-i-Shah have been treated. Some twenty-two were placed in chains, and of these one at least has died, it is said, from the effects of a wound on the head, which had been untended since his arrest. On the 13th instant two arrests were made m the vicinity of Gulahek. seems to be some reason to suppose that these arrests were bogus and ejected merely to produce the impression that even in Gulahek suspects are not beyond the Shah’s reach. Inclosure 1 in No. 211. Memorandum by Mr. Churchill. IN accordance with your instructions, I went to town this afternoon, and when M. Baranowsky, my Russian colleague, joined me at 6 p.m., as arranged by you, we drove together to the Bagh-i-Shah accompanied only by the escort of two Indian sowars and two gholams I had taken with me fiom Gulahek. I showed him the written instructions with which you had furnished me as to the general sense of the communication to be made by us to the Shah, and which, 1m said, exactly tallied with those he had received from the Russian Minister. I asked him to read a rough translation I had made on my way down, which he could commit to memory as he would have to act as spokesman. This he agreed to do, and when we were received by the Shah he repeated the message from memory with considerable accuracy. The Shah, who seemed to me to have been prepared beforehand, said in reply : “ As to the first point, you may assure the Minister and Charge d Affaires that I am doing all I can to maintain order, and they can be perfectly reassured as to the158 safety of their subjects.” Pointing to Colonel Liakhoff, who stood by his side with a native Cossack officer as interpreter, His Majesty added that the task of maintaining order was intrusted to the Colonel, and was at that moment making arrangements with him for this purpose. As to the second point, His Majesty desired us to convey his assurances that he had had no quarrel with the Assembly, and that the steps he had taken were directed against the revolutionary Anjumans and the disturbers of the peace m general. His Majesty intended, he said, to observe the Constitution which he had himself given to his people. I then referred to the special desire of the Indo-European Telegraph Department* and the Imperial Bank of Persia for extra guards. His Majesty promised that these would be sent. As we retired Amir Behadur Jang, who had been present at the audience, said he would himself send the necessary guards, and, calling up an aide-de- camp, asked me to tell him my wants. The officer in question promised to send the specified number of men the same evening, and this was punctually carried out. The Shah had received us in the open air at the door of a small garden outside the actual Bagh-i-Shah. ^ This garden had been found more convenient for the Royal harem, the Bagh-i-Shah itself being used for the Court officials, and subsequently as the prison m which the numerous political prisoners were detained. ^ 7 . , T ~ (Signed) G.

Mr, Marling to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received August 4.) (E x tract.) Gulahek, July 15, 1908, IIH lefeience to my telegram of the 24th ultimo, I have the honour to report that at about 7 o’clock on the evening of the 23rd ultimo I learnt by a note from Major Stokes that, although there had been no sign of any intention on the part of the popular party to take bast at His Majesty’s Legation, he thought it by no means improbable that some attempt would be made during the course of the night! Knowing that every precaution was to be taken by the troops by patrolling the streets and other police measures, it appeared that anything in the nature of bast en masse was practically out of the question, and I thought it unnecessary to send any special orders to Major Stokes, as ho was perfectly aware of the nature of the general instructions of the Legation in this matter, namely, that bast en masse was not to be tolerated under any conditions whatever, but that asylum could not be refused to persons who were in real and imminent danger of their lives. Towards 9 o’clock Major Stokes received a message from Taki Zade, the famous Tabreez Deputy, whose fearless and, at all events so far as public utterances are concerned, moderate advocacy ot the constitutional movement have made him an object of ino!tal hatred to the Shah, that he and two or three friends desired to take refuge in the Legation, as they were being hunted down by the troops and momen- t ari H expected to be captured, and unless received they would inevitably be put to death. iv a/ior Stn&lt;rp&gt;s rpnliVd in ’j-i, • t t* 7 ,, 1 „ , r.,i T , —V' r” , presented tucujocivea ar, me mam gate of the Legation and were admitted. There is not the smallest question that had r ^ sed a I least . tht T e &gt; and very probably more, of the party would have shared the fate of Jehangir Khan and Malek-el-Mutakellimin, who were stranded without tuai very early the following mornino-. Later the same night, or rather very early on Wednesday morning, Mortez Kuli Khan, an Ispahan Deputy, and seven other persons were admitted in much the same circumstances except that tney sent no previous warning. I am not prepared to say that they would have been put to death, but there can be no question but that one and all would have been brutally ill-used, as were, at all events for a time, a number of the prisoners at Bagh-i-Shah, among whom were some four or five Deputies. Some of them too, were undoubtedly perfectly innocent of all offence. Although the night passed quietly, except for numerous arrests, the town on Wednesday momma- the 24th was in a state of panic; reports of wholesale arrests and shooting accompanied by the most circumstantial evidence were current, and if credit had been given to one-tenth of them there would have been ample justification for giving shelter to every applicant who presented himself at our gates. The evil reputation which the Shah brought from Tabreez and_ the well-known ruthlessness of his chief Persian adviser, Amir Behadur Jang, were in the main responsible for the prevailing terror. At any rate, thatmorning no Persian could have been persuaded that any one once carried off to Bagh-i-Shah would leave the Shah’s camp alive. Proof of the terror that reigned is given by the fact that Mumtaz-ed-Dowleh, the President of the Medjliss, and two others, after two days spent in hiding in the Jewish quarter south of the bazaar, at last took refuge at the French Legation close to Zerguendeh disguised in the dirty rags of Dervishes. In the circumstances it is not surprising that a considerable number of people should have sought refuge at the Legation. At the moment there was, I am convinced, no idea whatever of taking bast en masse for political motives ; there was only blind terror, and the desire of each man was to get somewhere out of reach of the Shah ; and it is more than probable that had no guards been placed about the Legation, the great majority of the bastis would have been induced to return quietly to their own homes within a day or two. On the 26th the Proclamation of martial law containing the proviso that, in case of disrespect to the military, soldiers were empowered to use their arms appeared, and only increased the general terror. As instances of the alarm it inspired, I may mention that Meftah-es-Sultaneh, the head of the English section of the Foreign Office, who, like every one else, had been a member of an Anjuman, did not leave his house for two days; and Hussein Kuli Khan, Nawab, brother of Abbas Kuli Khan of His Majesty’s Legation, having reached his house in Gulahek, had not yet (15th July) ventured to return to Tehran. Applications for admittance to the Legation were received in ever- increasing numbers, but in spite of the fact that practically every one leaving the Legation was being a] rested, Major Stokes refused asylum to all except those whose account of themselves convinced him that they would be sent off to an unknown fate at Bagh-i-Shah. One or two persons succeeded in entering the Legation compound unknown to Major Stokes, probably through the side gate at which the water-carriers who fetch drinking water for the British colony from the Legation “ kanat ” habitually enter. ^ At my orders even this door was eventually closed, in spite of the considerable inconvenience caused thereby. Only two other persons managed to gain entrance by closely following a cart bringing in building material for the Military Attache’s house in course of construction. This was on the 9th instant, but the men did not pretend to be in any way concerned in political questions, but merely bastis of the ordinary kind, who hoped to use the Legation to obtain redress for a private grievance. It is very difficult to gauge the probabilities of an attempt to take bast in large numbers in His Majesty’s Legation. For the first day or two, as I have said, there was, so far as I can judge, no idea whatever of doing so for political purposes, and for some days afterwards; moreover, I am disposed to believe that the uncompromising refusals which any suggestions of the kind have encountered during the crisis of last December have been quite enough to convince the leaders of the Nationalists that such a move would be useless, although later there was no doubt a despairing hope among the masses that the Legation would receive them as in 1906. On the other hand, of course fear might have driven numbers to seek asylum with us, and once admitted to the Legation the bastis would unquestionably have desired to use their position to exact political terms from the Shah. I make no doubt that the Shah has been much impressed with the danger from his point of view of this contingency, and that he has been encouraged in it by his advisers. But I am no less convinced that, whatever probability has existed, it has been considerably enhanced by the persistency with which reports have been spread by the Court party that His Majesty’s Legation desired to bring about a bast en masse. In Gulahek there are some fifteen persons who may be said to have come for safety from arrest. Two of them are brothers inhabiting their own house, and of course no exception can be taken to their presence. The others have either rented small houses or are staying with their friends. So far as I can judge, out of the whole number there^ is only one who has any real cause for uneasiness. From this person, a Judge of the Court which condemned to imprisonment the leaders of the Shah’s hooligans in the December crisis, I received an urgent appeal to include his name among the list of those who had taken bast in the Tehran Legation, but in the circumstances I decided that I could not properly do so. He is not, from his own account, so much in danger from the Shah as at the hands of the men whom he tried, and who have been allowed by the Shah to return to Tehran from exile at Kelat. I am in hopes that my efforts to discourage the timorous from coming to Gulahek will be successful; but I [1072] . ' • - - - Mhave been, and still am, constantly asked what measure of protection I can give to temporary residents in the village, and it is not impossible that a few more may arrive. No. 213.

Mr, Marling to Sir Edivard Grey,—{Received August 4.) Gulaheh, July 15, 1908. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a Memorandum by Major Stokes describing in detail the manner in which His Majesty’s Legation was kept under military surveillance from the evening of the 24th June to the 30th. Major Stokes’ account only records what he actually saw himself, but, as a matter of fact, on two days, the 28th and 29th, the watch was even more close than he was aware of, for on those two days there were four, not two, posts stationed each some 250 to 300 yards from, and in sight of, the Legation compound, and so disposed that each on its round must pass along one or more of the roads bounding the Legation compound. The Memorandum, I think, shows quite clearly that from the evening of the 24th to some time during the night of the 25th the Legation was very closely watched; that on the 26th the watch was very much relaxed, but only to be renewed again on the following day by gendarmes ; and that on the 28th four pickets were stationed in such a manner as to patrol the roads all round the Legation at frequent intervals. On the 29th the patrolling was less obtrusively done, and on the next day the troops disappeared, though a few police were still hanging about.^ For the next three days there was little to complain of, but on tbe night of the 3 rd July a strong picket was posted on the road north of the Legation, and on the 4 th and 5 th patrols were constantly working round the Legation. The reason put forward for renewing the guards was the exaggerated story that preparations were being made at the Legation for the reception of a large number of ‘ £ bastis.” Attempts have been made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on instructions from the Shah to persuade me that the reports which I have had from Tehran as to these [1072] ' ' M 2proceedings were exaggerated. The answer is that in no other part of the town, not even in the vicinity of the Medjliss and the mosque, have any measures been taken in any way resembling those in force around His Majesty’s Legation, and that the state of affairs has been the common talk of the town and the Legation the centre of attraction for curious sightseers. No doubt the Shah has been nervously anxious to prevent the recurrence of “ bast ” in large numbers at the Legation, as in 1906, and no doubt also his apprehensions have been quickened by the reports brought him of our alleged endeavours to induce the bazaar people to seek asylum with us. My own impression is that the first measures on the evening of the 24th were taken without reflecting that a serious affront was being offered to a foreign Legation. It would have been perfectly simple to have prevented anything in the nature of a rush of refugees from the bazaar without placing a single soldier within sight of the Legation, or in a manner to which we could not have taken exception. I pointed this out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 26th ultimo, and he promised to try to induce the Shah to adopt less offensive measures, but his efforts seem to have achieved only the partial success of obtaining an altered disposition of the troops on the 28th and 29th June, I haye, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 214. Memorandum by Major Stokes respecting the Guards round His Majesty s Legation at Tehran, June 24 to June 80, 1908. June 24.—At about 7 p.m. some sixteen mounted Persian troops, under a Persian officer, came and took up a position directly in front of the main gate of the Legation and within 10 yards of it. ^ They were posted in single rank at intervals of about 3 yards. It happened that sixteen Persian soldiers, who had a few minutes before been turned out of the Legation for having been implicated in the looting on the previous day, were standing near the gate about to move off. These men the Persian officer also took command of, and posted them in front of the gate and within 2 or 3 yards of it. Mr. Churchill and Mr. Smart, who were just then starting for Gulahek, remonstrated with the officer, who, in reply, remarked that the Shah had the right to punish evil doers. He, however, moved his men—still in the same formation —to a distance of about 30 yards from the Legation gate. The detachment of soldiers moved away from in front of the gate, but lined up along the wall of the Legation immediately north of the gate. Mr. Churchill, on arrival at Gulahek, reported the above facts to Mr. Marling. Later, other posts of soldiers and gendarmes were established on the other three sides of the Legation in such a way as to prevent free access to it. No person was allowed to leave the Legation or to approach it without being molested. Mr. Hawkins, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who was temporarily occupying the house of the Charge d’Affaires in the Legation, had his carriage stopped when approaching the gate. Persians who came to the Legation on the most innocent business were at once seized and taken oft when they left it. The following incident occurred at the gate of the Legation .’ An acquaintance of our gholams—the son of a merchant at Constantinople at whose house our gholams iised to put up when they conveyed despatches there came to the Legation gate, spoke to a gholam, and then walked away. Befoie he had gone 10 yards he was seized by the head jiohceman of this quarter and hustled into a carriage, to be taken off as a prisoner, the policeman remarking, “ So you meant to go into the British Legation, did you ?” ’ The man tried to escape by getting out of the carriage, and a struggle ensued, whereupon a passing soldier at once fired at him. He wounded him, but also wounded the policeman, who died two days later of his wounds. The merchant’s son was taken off to prison, but was subsequently released in compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government. Legation servants who left the Legation were also molested by soldiers, and were only allowed to pa.ss when gholams went to their rescue. Three of these servants who were seated dunking tea at a tea-house opposite the gate were suddenly threatened by soldiers with rifles, whereupon they fled into the Legation. June 25. The above state of things continued during tins day. 'When MT 1 . Gye and Mr. Churchill arrived at 1 p.m. to interview the Minister for Foreign Affairs there were eight men within sight of the main gate of the Legation—four at the gate itself, within 2 yards of the walls, three at the guard-house opposite, and one who[1072] M 3 walked up the front of the Legation as they passed and stared rudely at them. There was also a detachment of soldiers—about twenty men—a short distance from the south east corner of the Legation. During the afternoon Abbas Kuli Khan arrived from Gulahek. Several soldiers at once rushed at his carriage, pointing their rifles at him. In the same way, when the carriage conveying the Foreign Office bag in charge of a gholam and a sowar—both in uniform—was near the main gate Cossacks rushed at it and thrust their rifles into the carriage. The men were withdrawn after dark. June 26.—At 10 a.m. there were no guards round the Legation, but one man was posted in the guard-house opposite the main gate. This man reported on all persons who entered or left the Legation. No objection could be taken to this man’s presence, as I found on inquiry that a soldier had been posted in each guard s house in the town. At 7 p.m. a carriage driving towards the Legation was stopped by a policeman, but allowed to pass when he was satisfied the occupant was not a refugee. June 27. —In the morning the head of the police of this quarter of the town came to the soldier on duty at the guard-house, and obtained from him details of what he had seen of people entering and leaving the Legation. A short time afterwards tw r o gendarmes were posted at the north-east corner of the Legation. I then walked right round the Legation and found other posts, five men at the south-east corner, six men at the south-west, four men on the north side. I spoke to the two latter parties. They were not in uniform, and stated that they were waiting for a carriage to take them to Niaveran, to which place they said the Shah was moving. Mr. Churchill arrived from Gulahek at 1 p.m. and found five gendarmes within 3 yards of the rnain gate, who told him they were on duty there. Mr. Churchill went on, but on his return a few minutes later he found two of them had gone to the guard-house, while the others had gone to the south-east corner of the Legation. He again spoke to them and said he would seize them if they loitered near the gate. A few minutes later they sent^ in a message by a gholam asking to be pardoned, and adding that they were only obeying orders, that they were forty in number, and were sent by the Chief of Police. Mr. Churchill then went to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose son came himself during the afternoon and interrogated the gendarmes as to who had posted them round the Legation. At 7T5 p.m. these men were still about, though not so conspicuous as earlier in the day. &gt; . June 28.—At 9 A.M. I walked round the Legation and found the following guards:— 1. A patrol under a Persian officer at the south-east corner. 2. A similar patrol at the north-west corner, but some 200 yards down the road* The procedure of these patrols was to move along two sides of the rectangular perimeter of the Legation, then halt at one corner for half an hour or so, in observation, and then repeat the process, so that the three sides of the Legation on which there are gates were all continuously under their observation. I spoke to one of the Persian officers, who told me his orders Were to patrol round the Legation. There were also posts of gendarmes of three to five men each at the south-east, south-west, and north-west corners. In addition to this, on two occasions at least men were seen to have climbed trees in order to ascertain, presumably, what prominent men were among the refugees. _ June 29.—Early in the morning there were eight armed gendarmes patrolling the roads round the Legation in pairs. By 10 A.M. their numbers had increased, and six men were posted at the south-east corner of the Legation. In the evening the mounted men were replaced by dismounted men, posted in pairs at the coineis. June 30.—There w^ere four or five gendarmes round the Legation. The soldiers had disappeared, but the gendarmes reported any one they saw have communication with the Legation to the troops on guard at the north gate of the Turkish Legation. This is only a few yards from the south-east corner of the British Legation, but is not visible from it. A gholam, observing a gendarme beckon to a carpenter who was employed in the Legation, watched both men. A short while afterwards the gendarme conducted the carpenter to the Chief of Police, who was round the corner near the Turkish Legation. The carpenter was being cross-examined as to the refugees in the Legation, when the arrival of the gholam caused the three men to separate, and the carpenter was brought to me. He stated that the Chief of Police had _ asked him the names of the refugees. I took steps to prevent a recurrence ot this nicident. _ (Signed) C. B. STOKES, Major.166 No. 215.

AS reported in my telegram of the 11th instant, the formal apology in reparation for the insults recently offered to His Majesty’s Legation was tendered to me by Ala-es- Sultaneh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Persian Government, and by the Vezir Afkham, the Minister of the Court, on behalf of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, on Saturday, the 11th instant. The ceremony, which was of the briefest description, took place in the drawing room of the Legation in Tehran. The staff of His Majesty’s Legation attended in uniform. The Ministers, who appeared in their official robes of honour, came together, and in turn read the apology, which was then translated by Mr. Churchill. At the same time the Minister of the Court handed to me the Shah’s guarantee for the lives, property, and persons of the refugees. In repty, I stated that I would not fail to communicate to His Majesty’s Govern ment this expression of regret on the part of the Persian Government, and that, in so far as this portion of His Majesty’s Government’s demands was concerned, the incident might be looked upon as at an end ; but I added a warning that if any attempt were made by the Shall to escape from the engagements into which lie had entered in regard to the security of the refugees and their property, the question would at once be reopened. The Minister of the Court then said that the Shah had given him a verbal message for me, in which His Majesty reiterated his assurances of good faith in regard to this point. I have the honour to transmit a copy of the note to the Persian Government communicating to them His Majesty’s Government’s demands, of their note accepting them, and of the English text of the apology, together with a translation of the Shah’s guarantee.

COGNIZANCE has been taken of the contents of your note of the 2nd July, containing five conditions, which you stated that you proposed to the Persian Govern ment in accordance with the instructions of your Government. The matter has been submitted to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, and, in view of His Majesty’s sacred resolve to give particular care to the protection and maintenance of the foundations of the friendship and concord existing between the two Governments, and in order to prove these pure intentions. His Imperial Majesty has agreed [to the demands], and has commanded me to inform you of the acceptance of the conditions contained in your note. Regarding the third point, you will, of course, inform the Persian Govern ment who the persons are whose release is required in order that the necessary orders may be given. With regard to the fourth point, security for the lives, property, and persons of the refugees in the Legation will be given; but as I have stated verbally, and as the British Government is aware, I remind you of the necessity that some of the refugees in the British Legation should travel for a time, since their presence is the cause of mischief, and their departure will conduce to the tranquillity of which the country is in so much need. The necessary orders have been issued for the execution of the above-mentioned conditions, and it is evident that you will consider this incident as completely closed. It is hoped that just as the Persian Government always endeavours as far as possible to meet the representations of the British Government, the latter will appreciate the good-will shown by the Persian Government.

Therefore His Imperial Majesty the Shah has been greatly displeased ^ at the conduct of his officials, and has charged me to convey to your Excellency his sincere regrets at these incidents, which were in no way in conformity with [his] sentiments of friendship towards England.

Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received August 4.) # St. Petersburg^ July 25, 1908. THE Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 22nd instant expressed, great anxiety to me regarding events in Tabreez. He said that the state of complete anarchy which reigned there was full of danger. The Russian Consul-General had not as yet been molested, and the crowd had been careful to avoid attacking foreigners, but there was no guarantee that some such thing might not occur. M. Isvolsky then spoke of the enormous losses to Russian trade involved by the continuance of the disorders, and went on to say that, though Russia did not wish it, the situation might become such as to oblige her to intervene. M. Isvolsky repeated that Russia did not wish to intervene, and would do so only if circumstances made it unavoidable. In any case she would of course not act without previous consultation with His Majesty’s Government. I saw the Minister of Foreign Affairs again yesterday and reverted to this subject, explaining that what his Excellency had said on the 22nd instant caused me some uneasiness. I had understood that in conversations which had taken place between himself and His Majesty s Ambassador it had been agreed on both sides that there should be no intervention in Persia so long as the lives and property of British and Russian subjects were respected. His Excellency now spoke of losses to Russian trade, if Russia was going to act on the principle of intervening whenever her trade suffered it would carry her far. M. Isvolsky, in reply, assured me that there was no change ^whatever in the policy of the Russian Government in this matter. To intervene m Persia was the ‘ last thing they desired.” The losses to Russian trade would have to be very great” indeed to bring about such a step. I must not take the words he had usedyn the 22nd instant to mean that Russia positively contemplated an act of intervention; he had merely wished to convey to me the apprehensions which he felt that circumstances might arise which would render it unavoidable.

THE proposals which the Financial Adviser laid before the Russian Minister and myself on the 26th and again on the 27th ultimo, after he had had a somewhat more detailed discussion with the Minister of Finance, have not yet taken a very definite shape, but I venture to think that a general outline of them may be of interest. M. Bizot particularly insists on the necessity of increasing the authority of the Minister of Finance, which at present is almost nil. Under the existing system the Minister of Finance has little or no control over any of the revenue receipts, with the exception of the Customs, the others being nominally encashed by an independent Treasurer, who is apparently never called on to give an account of the moneys that are paid into his keeping. The latter functionary, again, appears to have the power to call on the provincial authorities to pay up the revenues for the collection of which they are responsible, this duty being nominally incumbent on the k ‘ Mustaufis.” The “ Mustaufis ” are supposed to keep the Government accounts by a complicated system peculiar to themselves, and part of their duty is to adjust the financial dealings of the Central Government with the local authorities. For this purpose a “ Mustaufi ” resides in each provincial capital, and corresponds with one of the fraternity in Tehran specially detailed to deal with the money affairs of that province. They appear to be thoroughly corrupt, but so long as they furnish some kind of account—which no one can verify or even understand but themselves—of the funds they are supposed to encash, no questions are asked ; indeed, no one would appear to have the power to do so except those who are interested in keeping the veil drawn over their proceedings. M. Bizot desires to sweep away Treasurer and “Mustaufis ” alike, and to appoint a small Committee of Control, nominally subordinate to the Minister of Finance, but really created for the purpose of controlling his actions. This Committee would, in fact, be an advisory body without whose assent the Minister could take no action. As regards the organization of the Ministry, M. Bizot is in favour of the simplest scheme possible, as anything at all complicated would leave the door open to trickery and embezzlement. The revenues of Persia are veiy simple, being practically confined to the “ Maliat ” and the Customs, though there are a few other minor sources. The amount of the “ Maliat ” for each province is known, and could be used as a working basis to begin with, though later on it might be readjusted so as to secure the considerably larger revenues which it is believed should be obtained. There would seem, therefore, to be but little difficulty in forming a revenue branch, provided an honest official can be secured to preside over it. On the expenditure side, however, more building up will be required. Hitherto there has been no such thing as a Budget. M. Bizot has tried to explain it, but without success. The officials at the Ministry of Finance admit that expenditure and revenue should be made to balance, but they ask how can this be done when the customs revenue is an uncertain figure. The customs receipts, they argue, must therefore be left out of^ the Budget, and the ordinary expenditure cut down to the known amount of the “ Maliat ” and the other fixed sources of revenue. It seems that this has actually been done of late, and that the surplus customs receipts, after payment of the charges on them, have been looked upon as an extraordinary fund whence all sorts^ of unforeseen and unauthorized expenditure could be met. M. Bizot, however, believes that it will be possible to draw up expenditure estimates sufficiently accurate to form a provisional Budget. He also proposes that the Customs and the Mint should be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. . It is evident, however, that the success of his scheme, as he admits himself, depends entirelv on the composition and powers of the Committee of Control. M Bizot believes that he can name two or three honest and capable Persians who could be placed on it, but a European element in the contemplated Committee seems indispensable to give it the necessary stiffening to secure honest administration. ° Rut even presuming that a satisfactory Committee could be formed with propersecurity for its permanence, there still remains the difficult question of where to find the personnel requisite to organize a reasonably efficient Finance Department. Per sonally, I am convinced that it will be an almost impossible task, unless a certain number of the more responsible officials are Europeans. I think that, on the whole, M. Bizot is of the same way of thinking. M. Bizot was received in audience by the Shah on the 30th, and gave His Imperial Majesty an outline of the reforms which he proposed. The Shah raised no objections whatever, but rather professed the greatest readiness to give his assistance, especially for the formation of the Committee of Control. M. Bizot was careful to explain to His Majesty that he had not come to offer an advance from the two Governments, but rather to explain that they would not even take into consideration the question of assisting Persia in her present financial embarrassment, except on a definite pledge that the work of reform would be seriously taken in hand. M. de Hartwig believes that the Shah realizes this perfectly well. _ As regards the courtiers and Ministers, it is very probable that they are ready to advise His Majesty to accept any and every condition that may be attached by the two Powers to a joint advance should they agree to make one. There can be no question but that money is urgently needed ; yet while the Persian Government has been driven to the most desperate resorts to obtain it, as for instance, by anticipating the customs receipts, by “squeezing” the wealthy men who figured in the Constitutional party, or by borrowing at ruinous interest from the bazaars, no attempt is made to secure the rights of the State in the most obvious transactions. To quote an instance, I may mention that the Mint is coining all silver that is offered to it, but the very considerable profits—probably 10 percent.—go, not to the Government, but to the Director of the Mint, who gives no account of his stewardship. No one, indeed, knows whether the Mint or the telegraph service is carried on en regie or en affermage, and only one thing is certain, namely, that the State is being defrauded. So bad is the credit of the Government that both the English and Russian Banks have absolutely declined to allow the most trifling temporary accommodation even on the security of the customs. Reform will not be accepted, I fear, for its own sake, but merely as the only terms on which money can be obtained, and we must also be prepared to see that, as soon as the money is available, every effort to squander it and evade reform will be made. 1 he most stringent guarantees will be necessary if any useful end is to be achieved, and it will be M. Bizot’s task to devise 'the necessary conditions, lie is now engaged in ascertaining what would be the minimum amount of the advance required to tide the Government over its present difficulties, and, further, how best to secure that it is not diverted from its legitimate objects.

The few who left earlier were not properly bastis, but persons who had come to the Legation on innocent business while the troops were posted around it, and had declined to quit its shelter from fear of being arrested ; they left a day or two after the guards were withdrawn. As soon as 1 recei\ed the Rescript it was read by Mr. Smart to the bastis, and the great majority agreed to leave at once; but about twenty began to make difficulties. At first they declined to go on the ground that they could not trust the Shah’s word unless they veie furnished with a document from the Legation proving that they were among those in whose favour the special Rescript had been issued. There was, of couise, some excuse for them, since in spite of the Rescript of general amnesty arrests foi puiely political reasons had been numerous. I was very reluctant to give any such papeis, as the dangei of their being misused was obvious; but as there seemed no other v ay of inducing the men to go, I at last decided to issue a few to those who in one way oi another appear to have compromised themselves dangerously. The paperwas carefully worded, and stated merely that the hearer, whose name, occupation, and residence were accuratel} 7 given, had been among the refugees at the Legation. Before giving it I consulted the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the point, and he agreed that in this form it would be unobjectionable. The bastis, however, still manifested a great reluctance to leave, and all the persuasion and arguments employed daily, and almost hourly, by Mr. Smart, and also by Meftah-es-Sultaneh and Mr. Churchill, failed to shake their resolution for a day or two. That they were still afraid there can be little doubt, but I became later quite convinced that they were influenced by political motives also. I therefore instructed Mr. Smart to use much more pressing language to them, and even to hint broadly that as the Legation could not permit them to remain for political reasons only, I might find it necessary to use stronger measures to remove them. I venture to hope that 1 did not exceed my instructions in doing so. The intimation was finally, though not immediately, successful, and on the 16th there remained only ten bastis in the Legation, viz., the six whom the Shah desired should leave the country, and four others who were to return to their homes in Azerbaijan. As regards the former, the Shah began by asking that Taki Zadeh should leave Persia for ten years, Beha-ul-Vaizin, the preacher, for five, one newspaper editor for seven, and another for eight years; but as I raised objections to these long terms, which amounted to a serious punishment of deportation, which was not compatible with the terms of the Rescript, giving a general amnesty to all political agitators, and particularly to those in refuge at His Majesty’s Legation, these periods were subsequently reduced as folk Taki Zadeli Baka-ul-Vaizin .. Mirza Ali Akhbar Khan Sadik-ul-Harem.. JSeyyid Hassan .. Moazed-es-Sultaneh left voluntarily on the plea of his ill-health, and no term for him was fixed. Four others were to leave for their homes. I need not trouble you, Sir, with the tedious and irritating negotiations which terminated in the departure for Enzeli of the remaining refugees on the 18th and 19th July in carriages provided by the State. It was necessary to arrange for some money for their travelling and other expenses to be supplied to them by the Shah, which was eventually done. The refugees showed themselves again extremely unreasonable, and some^ of them even asked that the Shah should give them an allowance to live on during their absence from Persia. I naturally declined to listen to any such pretensions, but it was only with the greatest difficulty that their resistance was finally overcome. I must say, in justice to Taki Zadeh, that throughout his stay at the Legation he earnestly seconded Mr. Smart’s endeavours to get the bastis to leave. The bastis finally left in two parties on the 18th and 19th July, each in charge of a “ Mamur ” of the Foreign Office, and accompanied by a gholam of the Legation.^ Mr. Smart’s assistance throughout has been most valuable, and deserves all praise. Meftah-es-Sultaneh, K.C.M.G., the head of* the English Department of the Foreign Office, acted as a go-between in the negotiations with the Shah, through whom the terms of the apology and Rescript were arranged, and the subsequent negotiations as to the departure from Persia of the remaining refugees were conducted. His assistance was invaluable, as was that of Ala-es-Sultaneh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has throughout shown the strongest good sense, and made every endeavour to bring about a speedy settlement.

BY his note of the 31st August, 1907, His Majesty’s Minister had the honour to inform your Highness of the terms on which His Britannic Majesty’s Government was prepared to assent to the request of the Persian Government for the suspension for three years of the sinking fund on the Loan of 1903-1. To this note no reply was made, but no payment on capital account was made, and the interest was, moreover, allowed to fall into arrears. His Majesty’s Government considered that they were in the circumstances justified in assuming that the terms above alluded to were tacitly accepted by the Persian Government, and I was accordingly instructed to inform your Highness’ predecessor of that view. In reply to my note of the 21th Pebruary, in which I carried out those intructions, his Excellency Mushir-ed-Dowleh informed me that a reply to Sir Cecil Spring-Bice’s note would be sent me shortly. Although five months have elapsed, I have, however, received no answer; and I have now received the instructions of His Majesty’s Permanent Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs to inform your Highness that, in the absence of the promised reply, and in view of the fact that the interest on the loan is again in arrears, and that no payment has been made on account of the sinking fund since the 4th April, 1906, His Majesty’s Government can no longer admit of any discussion of the terms laid down in Sir Cecil Spring-Bice’s note above mentioned.

Monthly Summary of Events in Persia. The General Situation. THE Shah remains at Bagh-i-Shah, where preparations are being made for a long stay. Amir Behadur Jang, who has received the title of Sepah-Salar and post of War Minister, seems to he all-powerful. Although the popular movement has, to all intents and purposes, been successfully crushed since the 23rd June, and the only effective resistance has been that offered by the people of Tabreez, who are still fighting, there are ample indications of future trouble in the form of a recrudescence of the movement. The clergy of Nejef have pronounced themselves against the Shah, and though their telegrams have been suppressed the news is generally known. The effect of the news from Turkey has not been very great, and will probably only react later. In the meantime the Shah appears to be in great financial difficulties, and M. Bizot is at present engaged in preparing a scheme by which something might be done to improve the situation. The extraordinary military preparations at Bagh-i-Shah and the dispatch of troops to Azerbaijan have contributed to deplete the Treasury. (Signed) G. P. CHUBCHILL, Oriental Secretary.174 Urumia. Mr. Wratislaw reports that Urumia was quite unaffected by the Shah’s cuup d'Etat. He expresses the opinion that the Shah cannot count on having it all his own way in Azerbaijan, in spite of his apparent success for the moment. Meshed. fighting. The Reform party at Meshed has accepted defeat without the slightest idea of Turbat-i-Hayderi. The people received the news of the coup d'Etat almost with indifference. Ispahan. It appears that the Shah has no supporters in Ispahan, hut, in spite of this, the Nationalist leaders seem to be in a great state of fear. The Ikbal-ed-Dowleh, who replaces Ala-ul-Mulk as Governor, has not yet arrived. His arrival may lead to those who feel themselves in danger taking refuge in His Majesty’s Consulate-General. Agha Nejefi appears to he working for the Shah, but his brother, Agha Norullah, publicly condemned one of the Shah’s Proclamations as contrary to religion and freedom. Ikbal-ed-Dowleh’s deputy reached Ispahan on the 19th July. On the 8th August he telegraphed to Tehran to his chief that a telegram from the chief priests at Nejef had been put up at the entrance to a mosque. Its contents were that any man killed for the popular cause was equal to the martyrs of Kerbela. It was torn down by soldiers, but he feared that disturbances would ensue, and asked for more troops, Agha Norullah had from the pulpit urged the people to close their shops, hut the Deputy Governor warned the people by criers that any shops closed would be plundered by soldiers. Yezd. The Intizam-ul-Mulk was removed from the Governorship, hut reinstated on an appeal being made to the Shah by the people. Since the end of June the Yezd-Nain road has again become unsafe, caravans and posts have been robbed, and the road is infested with numbers of mounted robbers. The entire postal service is disorganized, and the Governor is apparently doing nothing. Sultanabad. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul reported on the 6th June that there were six Political Societies each trying to govern the district, that the Governor was powerless, that the leaders of the Societies were intolerant priests who were trying to create an anti- European feeling, and that Messrs. Ziegler and Co., who had advanced money and w r ool to the value of 30,000/. to weavers, were finding it daily more difficult' to collect outstandings. Shiraz. In the first week of July fifteen artillerymen took refuge in His Majesty’s Consulate in order to obtain from the Persian Government their pay, which was one year in arrears. They v T ere subsequently induced to leave under a promise of being paid. The Commander of the Chaharmahal Regiment also told His Majesty’s Acting Consul that his men might have to take refuge with a similar object. The fighting on the Bushire road between the villages of Kemarej and Daliki discontinued wTiile Zil-es-Sultan was Governor-General, broke out again on the 6th July. There is no hope of order on this road except under a strong Governor- General. Though Shiraz has remained quiet, the Province of Ears is in a state of disorder, and robberies are reported from all sides. Kazeroon is in a state of siege, the contending leaders being Hayder Khan of Kamarej and Mirza Kazir Khan, late Deputy Governor. The latter has since taken refuge at*His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz. Between the 4th and 25th July the Tehran post woas robbed four times by Arabs, and the Ispahan road is quite unsafe. The appointment of Asaf-ea-Dowieh as Governor- General was greeted with derision, the Shirazis recalling his previous effort to govern Shiraz. Serdar Eirouz, Deputy Governor, arrived at Shiraz on the 16th July. (Signed) C. B STOKES, Major, Military Attache'.Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received August 31.) Sir, Gulahek, August 12, 1908. IN continuation of my despatcli of tlie 1st instant, I have the honour to report that M. Bizot, the Financial Adviser, was summoned to Bagh-i-Shah on the 6th instant to explain to the Prime Minister, in whose favour the title of Grand Vizier has been revived, the nature of his proposals for the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance. The result of the interview, which lasted over two hours, was discouraging. Two or three other Ministers besides Mushir-es-Sultaneh were present, and Amir Behadur Jang, who unites in his own person the two offices of Commander-in-chief (“ Sepahsalar ”) and Minister of War, occasionally put in a momentary appearance. His contribution to the discussion never went beyond an urgent demand for money. It would be tedious to repeat in detail the account which M. Bizot gave me of his experiences, and it will suffice to say that, with the sole exception of Ala-es-Sultaneh, who arrived near the end of the discussion, the Ministers and courtiers present one and all used language which showed that they had expected to find in M. Bizot an official whose sole duty it was to find the means of raising money for them to squander. Finally, however, M. Bizot managed to obtain a list of the cf pressing needs” of the Persian Government, It ran as follows :— Tomans. Improvement of army, expenses of arsenal, purchase of tents, and other necessary military expenditure .. .. .. .. 500,000 Arrears of pay of troops and pay during current year, and uniforms for troops .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 500,000 Construction of frontier fortresses in Azerbaijan, Astara, Kermanshah, Seistan, and Baluchistan .. .. .. .. .. 300,000 Payment of pensions fallen in arrears on account of recent disorders .. 200,000 Balance of purchase-money of rifles, &amp;c., ordered by the late Shah, and purchase of new rifles and cartridges .. .. .. .. 500,000 Total .. .. .. .. .. 2,000,000 Or, in round figures, 400,000/., the amount of the joint advance contemplated in the end of 1906. As M. Bizot observed, when he showed it to me the next morning, this remarkable production was unmistakably the work of Amir Behadur Jang, into whose hands 1,800,000 tomans out of 2,000,000 tomans would pass. While M. Bizot was with me, Kavam-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of Finance, was announced, and at my suggestion M. Bizot remained during his visit. After a little skirmishing the Minister asked M. Bizot to produce the list, and inquired what I thought of it. I replied by asking his Excellency if he expected that I should take such a proposal seriously. The Persian Government were asking us to advance a considerable sum, of which nine-tenths was to be confided to Amir Behadur Jang without any sort of guarantee that it would be properly expended, while the remainder was to be wasted in paying fraudulent pensions. I was sure that my Government would never listen to such a proposal, even if I consented to submit it, which I was not prepared to do. To my mind the proposal was nothing hut a foolish attempt on the part of Amir Behadur Jang and his friends to line their own pockets, just as they might have hoped to do in similar circumstances under the old regime. His Excellency must be aware that His Majesty’s Government would never assent to assist the Persian Government to raise money for such a purpose. I was, I said, much disappointed at finding that the Persian Government clearly had no real intention of instituting reform in its finances. Kavam-ed-Dowleh was considerably disconcerted, and tried to argue that the Com mittee which M. Bizot vras to form at the Department of Finance would prove an ample guarantee that the money, if advanced, would not be squandered. Having been told by M. Bizot just before Kavam-ed-Dowleh’s arrival that his Excellency had proposed that three of the five seats on the Committee were to be occupied by the Minister and his two sons, I replied that I must be satisfied of the composition of the Committee before I could put much faith in it, and went on to ask why, if the Government really desired reform, no provision for the necessary expenditure it must entail appeared on the list of “pressing needs”; why, too, was there no mention of the payment of the salaries of the Persian Ptepresentafives abroad, which I had been told was a matter of such great urgency. M. Bizot warmly supported my arguments, pointing out that he, as Financial Adviser, could never recommend the Minister to adopt such a list as the onefurnished. Without details there could bo no control over the expenditure. Did the Minister pretend that no other Department except the War Office had any pressing need for money ? It was perfectly obvious that the list was drawn up without the smallest regard for the public interest. If the Persian Government expected to obtain any kind of assistance the Minister must aid him, M. Bizot, to ascertain how the financial position actually stands, and to draw up an accurate and detailed statement of the urgent wants of each Department. Kavam-ed-Dowleh appeared to be somewhat downcast at the result of the interview, but M. Bizot assured me that his Excellency was perfectly aw T are that he had come on a fool’s errand, and was probabl 3 r only dismayed at the prospect of having to face Amir Behadur Jang and the Court camarilla with the confession of having achieved nothing. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 228. Mr. Marling lo Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 31.) Sir, Gulahek, August 13, 1908. IN continuation of my despatch of the 15th July, I have the honour to report that since that date the struggle between the Shah’s forces and the insurgents at Tabreez continued intermittently up to the 9th instant, and with fluctuating fortune. On the 15th July the inhabitants of the quarter occupied by the insurgents unsuccessfully endeavoured to send a telegram to the Shah through the Erench Vice- Consul stating they were ready to surrender, but feared the Government troops would pillage their houses. The following morning the fighting, which had been incessant, ceased, and negotiations were begun by the Elders of the surrendered quarters, who sought to reconcile the authorities and insurgents. These, however, proved abortive, owing to the attitude of the Chief Mujtehed, who, having control over the telegraph wires, refused to allow the insurgent leaders to telegraph to Tehran to obtain the Shah’s pardon, failing which, they refused to lay down their arms, though the Commander of the Imperial forces was willing enough that the telegram should be sent. These events and the behaviour of the Mujtehed greatly incensed the population, and a resolve began to manifest itself to accept no amnesty or pardon from the Shah unless guaranteed by the foreign Consulates. On the 18th July Mr. Stevens telegraphed that hostilities were suspended, thanks to the Russian Consul-General having undertaken to disperse the Anjumen-i-Islamieh, the head-quarters of the Mujtehed and the reactionary party, the town being practically in the hands of the armed populace, and many of the Government horsemen having deserted. On the 18th July a regiment of infantry 800 strong reached Tabreez and deserted imme diately. Meanwhile the Russian Consul-General’s intervention proved unavailing, and a partially successful attack was made on the Government troops, wffio were driven back to their second line of defence, but on the night of the 21st to the 22nd July the revolutionaries were compelled to recede from their advanced positions, reinforcements having arrived for the Shah’s party. On the morning of the 23rd there was another lull, the revolutionaries, though hard pressed, having held their ground. On the next day fighting recommenced, the Royalists bringing a 9-inch mortar into action, which did considerable damage. On the 27th the situation got worse, six guns altogether being in action, and as the shooting was somewhat erratic the Christian quarter was thought to be in danger. On the 28th a meeting of the Consular Corps, attended by the merchants’ delegates, was held at the Russian Consulate-General. The merchants stated that the population would lay down their arms on condition of receiving a complete amnesty for political offences, guaranteed by the Legations, the dissolution of the Anjumen-i-Islamieh, and Rahim Khan only being permitted to remain with fifty horsemen in Tabreez. The Consuls approved these proposals, and considered the revolutionary leaders should be permitted to leave Persia without molestation. Hostilities were suspended during these and other efforts at reconciliation, but again broke out on the 1st August, neither party being able to offer guarantees for the execution of the terms of any proposed settlement. The citadel, which the revolu tionaries continuously held, was bombarded, and shells fell in the Christian quarter.[1072] N On the 2nd the revolutionaries cut all the wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul only induced them with great difficulty to permit the necessary repairs, and then they required that no Government messages should he sent. On the 4th August news of the restoration of the Turkish Constitution was divulged hy the Ottoman Consul-General. This naturally put heart into the National party, who placarded the town with a manifesto roughly to the effect that, unless they could obtain a satisfactory settlemeut before the arrival of a Governor-General with reinforcements, the Sultan would he as good a Sovereign as the Shah. On the 7th August fighting, which had been desultory, was vigorously renewed hy the Shah’s forces. Heavy fighting continued for three days with shell and rifle fire. Mr. Stevens has mentioned in several telegrams that the conduct of the Shah’s troops has been characterized throughout by f ‘ atrocious acts ” and indiscriminate looting. On the 2nd August he reported that the firms of Ziegler and Stevens had officially addressed the Consulate-General, expressing the hope that the Persian Government would he held responsible for losses eventually sustained, as they feared the looting of houses and shops would spread to the bazaars. I thereupon addressed a note to the Persian Government, asking that proper steps should be taken to protect the property of British subjects, and saying that my Government would be compelled to hold that of His Majesty the Shah responsible for any losses sustained through the action of troops serving the Persian Government. On the 9th August I received a responsive note from the Minister for Eoreign Affairs, stating that my note had been communicated to the Grand Vizier, who had been specially requested to send the necessary orders for the protection of British firms and subjects. It is difficult to estimate how far the serious events in Tabreez since the Shah’s coup d'Etat were originally inspired by genuine political motives, and if so for how long the struggle maintained its essentially political character. I am myself inclined to believe that the opposition to Bahim Khan’s operations was largely actuated by private animosity on the part of the “ national leaders,” and I think that there can be little doubt that the Nationalists now feel there is nothing left for them but to fight to a finish, and that were they to surrender, conditionally or unconditionally, neither their lives, their families, nor their property would be safe from the vengeance of the Boyalist troops, exasperated by the prolonged resistance of the Azerbaijan “ patriots.” Nor is it likely that their fears are ill-founded.

Text of identic communication which it is proposed that Russian and British Representatives at Tehran should make to Shah is as follows:— “ As His Majesty the Shah has made known his intention of shortly publishing the new Regulations concerning the approaching legislative elections, the Minister of Russia (British Charge d’Affaires) considers, in conformity with the instructions from his Government, and without in any way wishing to intervene in the internal affairs of Persia, that it would he very desirable and opportune in the interests of the definitive pacification of the country and of trade, and of the general prosperity, that His Majesty the Shah would be pleased at the same time to announce that his decision to maintain the organic laws which he has granted to his Empire is irrevocable, and that the Assembly about to be elected will meet at Tehran on the 14th November.” The Shah had quite recently told the Russian Minister—so M. Tcharykoff explained to me—that it was his intention shortly to publish the regulation for the new elections. Assistant Minister for Eoreign Affairs considers that British and Russian Representatives might now be placed in possession of proposed communication, which could then be made at the time and in the form which they considered most appropriate for the step.L78 No. 230. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received September 1.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 1, 1908. HIS Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Tabreez reports by telegraph that the authorities at Tehran evidently do not realize the gravity of the situation in Tabreez, which continues to get worse. The revolutionaries will listen to no terms of peace unless the Constitution is guaranteed, elections ordered, and the Parliament reassembled^ They have completely lost confidence in the Government. The forces of the Nationalist party are now 10,000. Yesterday the Local Assembly appointed a Committee to obtain funds from all Christians to aid in meeting the daily expenses towards keeping up the struggle, and Armenian revolutionaries are being pressed to take an active part. A private warning has been received by Mr. Stevens not to go out alone, as, the revolutionaries being desperate, they have determined to kill a foreigner or a Christian and so bring about European intervention. Vice-Consul states that the sooner the Shah informs Tahreez of his intention to order elections, if he really does intend to do so, the better, the revolutionary leaders being too deeply involved to abandon the struggle now. Vice-Consul is of opinion that all Christians and Europeans may find themselves in imminent danger at any moment, as great excitement has prevailed during the last few days. A joint representation to the Shah seems desirable, and I am suggesting this course to Russian Minister. No. 231. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 2, 1908.

I have received no very recent news myself. In view of the fact that, in spite of the advice of the two Governments to take conciliatory steps at Tabreez, His Majesty permitted the Maku Kurds to attack the town, the reply of the Shah appears to me especially unsatisfactory.

The Yezd- Kerman and Yezd-Ispahan roads are infested with robbers, and the posts are continually delayed. The Deputy Governor of Kerman w T as attacked and robbed on his way to that town on the 30th July. A crowd of Persians having interfered with the school teachers of the Mission school, Dr. Aganoor sent four men of the Consular escort to the school, after which the interference ceased. Though the news of the grant of a Constitution to Turkey and telegrams from the priests at Nejef and Kerbela supporting the Nationalists in Persia have encouraged the local priests to interfere somewhat with the Deputy Governor’s administration, no active opposition to the new regime has been shown. Yezd. The collection of the additional taxes which led to the agitation here two months ago is now being carried out by the Governor. Opposition is suppressed by force, and several men of a crowd who wished to take sanctuary in protest against the taxes have been severely beaten by the Governor’s troops. Kerman. A popular movement has sprung up in the districts, and Rubbar, Jiruft, and Rudbar are affected. Troops have been sent to quell the rising. Shiraz.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward (drey.—(Received September 28.) Sir, Gulahek, September 10, 1908. YOUR telegram of the 4th September, containing instructions to present with out delay the joint communication to be made by the Russian Minister and myself to the Shah inviting His Majesty to summon the new Parliament for the 1st (14th) November, and urging on him the advisability, in the interests of peace, of publishing his intention to do so at Tabreez, reached me on the morning of the 5th instant. As it was a Saturday, on which day M. de Hartwig is always particularly occupied with the dispatch of his weekly messenger, I contented myself with apprising him in the afternoon of the nature of your instructions, and called on him the next morning to discuss the manner in which the communication should be made. M. de Hartwig said he supposed it was intended that the communication should be made in writing through the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I replied that I under stood that it was to be made to the Shah directly, and I presumed that we must ask for an audience. The Minister reminded me that as the Shah had been confined to his “ Anderun ” for some few days by fever, His Majesty would very probably be unable to receive us, and perhaps it would be better to send the Oriental Secretaries of the two Legations to Bagh-i-Shah to deliver the communication to His Majesty. To this I agreed, as it would evidently have been easy to defer the audience at the last moment on the ground of the Shah’s ill-health. It was therefore arranged that a Persian translation of the communication should be made, and that copies signed by M. de Hartwig and myself should be presented to the Shah by M. Baranowsky and Mr. Churchill on the morning of the 8th instant, and that in case that His Majesty was unable to receive them, Ala-es-Sultaneh should be requested to be in attendance, in order that the document might be intrusted to him for communi cation to the Shah. On the evening of the 7 th instant I received a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs informing me that His Majesty’s indisposition would prevent the Shah from receiving the dragomans, and Mr. Churchill and M. Baranowsky on reaching Bagh-i- Shah thereupon handed the identic Memoranda to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who undertook to submit them to His Majesty. A copy of the communication is herewith inclosed. I have, Ac. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 250. Joint Memorandum handed to the Shah by British and Russian Oriental Secretaries, September 8, 1908. AS His Imperial Majesty the Shah has made known his intention of shortly publishing the new Regulations concerning the approaching elections, the British Charge d’Affaires has the honour, in conformity with the instructions from his Government, and without in any way wishing to intervene in the internal affairs of Persia, to point out that it would be very desirable and opportune, in the interests of the definite pacification of the country, and of trade and of general prosperity, that His Imperial Majesty the Shah would be pleased to announce that his decision to maintain the Constitution which he has granted to his Empire is irrevocable, and that the Assembly for which the election of Deputies is now about to proceed will meet at186 Tehran on the 1st (14th) November (equivalent to the 19th of Shavval) of this year. His Majesty’s Charge cTAffaires is further instructed to draw the serious attention of His Majesty the Shah to the gravity of the situation at Tabreez, and to warn His Majesty that the whole responsibility for the security of British suhjects^in that town will be laid on the Persian Government. Under these circumstances he considers it advisable that His Imperial Majesty’s decision to proceed to the elections and to open Parliament on the 1st (14th) November should be communicated to and made public at Tahreez. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 251. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 28.) Sir, Gulahek, September 10, 1908. IN continuation of my despatch of the 13th ultimo, I have the honour to report that after the severe fighting which took place at Tabreez on the 7th August and the two succeeding days open hostilities were not resumed until the 6th instant, though the opposition of the Nationalist party to the forces of the constituted authority remained undiminished and all efforts on the part of the leading merchants of the town, the Governor-General, and, more recently, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul to effect a peaceful settlement of the difficulties of the situation have proved abortive. Delegates of the Governor-General arrived at Tahreez on the 15th August for the purpose of investigating and reporting on the state of affairs to his Excellency, who, together with the Commander-in-chief, reached the town on the 20th ultimo. On the 23rd ultimo the Local Assembly presented a Petition to his Excellency and formulated their demands, which were briefly that, while remaining loyal subjects of the Shah as long as he maintained the Constitution, they would not disarm until a Parliament was opened and the Members recalled ; that the leaders in the Royalist quarter should he arrested and punished after trial; and that the affairs of the Province of Azerbaijan should be under the supervision of the Tabreez Local Assembly until Parliament reassembled. His Excellency promised to communicate these demands to the Shah. At the end of the month, no reply having been received from the Tehran authorities, the tension between the two parties became sensibly greater and the Nationalists refused to listen to any offer of terms of peace unless the Constitution were guaranteed, elections ordered, and Parliament reassembled. The Nationalist forces at this time numbered some 10,000 men and efforts were made to enlist the services of Armenian revolutionaries in the cause. The Local Assembly formed a Committee to collect funds from all Christians to help towards meeting the daily expenses of keeping up the struggle and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul received a warning not to go out alone, as the revolutionaries had decided to force the intervention of the European Powers by killing a foreigner or some Christian. It is difficult to believe that there was any real intention of carrying out this threat, but there is little doubt that the excitement in the town had by this time reached a very high pitch, and the lives of Europeans and Christians might at any moment have been in imminent danger. On the 2nd instant, at the request of the leading merchants of the town, His Majesty’s \ice-Consul presented the minimum of their demands to the Governor- General, who, though anxious to restore order, refused to grant these terms unless he received guarantees that the population would lay down their arms and would accept at least some of his conditions. He, however, expressed his willingness to see the leaders and verbally guaranteed to Mr. Stevens the safety of all those who should go to him. He further invited Mr. Stevens to accompany them if they wished it. The merchants were unwilling to go to see the Governor-General, as they were in fear of the resentment of the population, but they consented to meet His Highness on neutral ground. Mr. Stevens succeeded in arranging a meeting on these lines, and it was decided that a deputation of the inhabitants should wait on the Governor-General to discuss matters with him. During the course of these negotiations the revolutionaries had abstained from all acts of violence, but, on the evening of the 5th, some Government horsemen entered a large caravanserai and looted the shops of merchants in the Nationalist quarters. This action on the part of the Government forces naturallyexcited the utmost indignation among the revolutionaries, and was taken as a proof of the impossibility of placing any confidence in the good faith of the authorities. Fighting was consequently resumed on the 7th. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 252. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received September 28.) Sir, Gulahek, September 10, 1908. I HAVE the honour to report that for some time past there have been several refugees at His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz. These persons, the first of whom, Hussein, son of Naib-es-Sadr and nephew of Hajji Ali Agha, leader of the Anjuman-i- Islamie of Shiraz, went to the Consulate on the 22nd July, have been driven to take sanctuary by the action of the Deputy Governor, Sardar-i-Eiruz, who has been in charge of the province pending the arrival of Asef-ed-Dowleh, the Governor-General. Hussein was shortly after followed by Mirza Kassim Khan, brother of the late Motamed-i-Divan. These persons stated that, in spite of the amnesty issued by the Shah to all political offenders, they had every reason to fear the action of Sardar-i- Eiruz against them and Kassim Khan, who received a promise from the Deputy Governor that his life would be respected upon payment of a bribe of 1,700 tomans and horses to the value of 2,000 tomans, was subsequently handed over to Kawami sowars who were removing him from Shiraz, when he escaped and went to the Consulate. Other refugees followed during the month of August, but some, including the son of Naib-es-Sadr, were induced to leave. The most serious case has been that of Kassim Khan for, during his stay in His Majesty’s Consulate, the spoliation of his family and the plundering of his property has been carried out under the orders of the Deputy Governor. The present condition of insecurity in the whole province and the total lack of confidence in the guarantees of the Deputy Governor make it impossible to induce Kassim Khan to put faith in the local authorities, and he now desires to leave Persia by Bushire, whither he would accompany Major Cox upon his return to that place. It is clear that so long as the Deputy Governor, who is a notoriously unprin cipled ruffian, is allowed to remain at Shiraz he will lose no opportunity of filling his pockets by threatening and plundering persons who have reason to think that their political opinions may lead them into danger. I have repeatedly represented to the Persian Government the most serious effect which the presence of such an unscrupulous and incompetent official as Sardar-i-Eiruz has throughout his tenure of office proved himself to be must have in the province, and have urged most strongly that he should be removed and that Asef-ed-Dowleh may arrive at his post with as little delay as possible. In spite of the assurances of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Excellency, though on his way to Shiraz, has not yet arrived at his post. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 253. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 28.) gi rj Gulahek, September 10, 1908. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 5 th instant, in which you were so good as to inform me in what circumstances and on what conditions His Majesty’s Government would be willing, as was contemplated in 1906, to make, with Russia, a joint advance of 400,000Z. to the Persian Government. I fear that there, is little likelihood that the Financial Adviser will be in a position to justify such an advance within the immediate future. When, about two months ago, the possibility of an advance from Great Britain and Russia was first mooted, the Shah’s advisers, who were so elated at the prospect of having a substantial sum on which to lay their hands, were ready to promise to abide by any conditions that might188 be imposed, in the belief that they would always be able to evade them. They even went so far as to make a show of carrying out M. Bizot’s proposed reforms by allowing the Committee which he desired to create for the supervision of the Ministry of Finance to be appointed and to hold sittings, while orders were given—though not executed—that each Department should prepare and submit a budget of its annual expenditure. But they never had the smallest intention of relaxing their hold on the Treasury, and consequently the complementary measure of appointing a Treasurer under the direct orders and control of the Minister of Finance was never effected. On the contrary, a new Treasurer, the notoriously corrupt Naser-es-Sultaneh, was appointed, and the waste and peculation of the public monies encashed by him goes on with increased facility. M. Bizot, who was at first encouraged by the Government’s hypocritical professions to hope that something might be achieved in the w r ay of reform, has now lost hope of effecting anything under the existing regime. On the 1st instant he obtained an audience of the Shah, in which he intended to expose to His Majesty the scandalous way in which the country’s revenues are being squandered, but the reception which he met with from the Shah was cold, almost to discourtesy, and he thought it useless to carry out his intention. M. Bizot w r ould have, I think, no difficulty in producing a statement of really urgent claims on the Treasury, such, for instance, as the arrears of salary due to the Persian Diplomatic and Consular Representatives abroad and to the Foreign Office officials.- 1 venture to think, however, that so long as the present camarilla under Amir Behadur Jang retains its power we should refuse even this assistance, for the relief granted would merely mean that the small sums which are now secured for genuine public expenses would be embezzled. In these circumstances, I think it would be in the true interests oi: Persia that we should refuse to give them any financial assistance. So long as there is any prospect of screwing money out of the country so long the harpies about the Shah will resist reform, whether as a condition of a loan or through the agency of the Mejliss, and no more effective way of discouraging them occurs to me than that of cutting off every source of revenue which they can plunder. As regards the two conditions formulated in your telegram, the probabilities appear to be that the Shah will be obliged to convene Parliament before the Financial Adviser is in a position to recommend that an advance should be made, and I presume that should the Mejliss be sitting when the application is made His Majesty’s Govern ment would be disposed to consider that fact as sufficient fulfilment of the stipulation that the money is not to be used to suppress the Constitution. There is, however, always the possible contingency to be taken into account, that the new Mejliss may be so caielully packed, or so effectually intimidated by the Shah, that it would not defend its own existence. The second condition that there shall be proper guarantees for controlling the expenditure of^ the money might be taken advantage of to extend the powers of the •financial Adviser. The two Legations have no effective means of exercising the control contemplated in connection with the proposed advance in 1906, but if they were instructed to insist that the necessary supervision should be intrusted to M. Bizot, that gentleman s position would receive an accession of influence and authority which is at present sadly wanting. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 254. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 28.) ^ r ’ nrrr™T&gt;t? • i-ixi Gulahek, September 10, 1908. . J-HERE 18 bttle outward change to record in the general condition of Persia (urmg the last month. The struggle at Tabreez still continues, and there would not seem to be much hope that the arrival of Ain-ed-Dowleh, the new Governor-General, v it i lemfoicements under Sepahdar, has tended to bring it any nearer to a solution, and though for something like a month fighting ceased while negotiations for a com promise weie pioceeding, hostilities recommenced on the 6th instant owing to a singulaily ill-timed act of bad faith on behalf of the Royalist forces. I am inclined to that it is beyond the Shah’s power to put down the popular movement m Tabieez by force. As usual the state of affairs in the capital is reflected in the least settled parts of the country, and the roads round Shiraz and between Yezd and Ispahanare infested with brigands, while in Kerman a notorious local outlaw named RAfat-i- ISizam raised the standard of revolt at Eahry on the edge of the desert, and was not crushed without some difficulty. The districts around, as far as Bam, suffered much from pillage by both parties. Major Sykes reports a rumour of the presence of a very strong hand of Turkoman raiders at Jajerm, north of Miandast, on the Tehran- Meshed road. Otherwise the country generally is in its normal state, but the general uncertainty as to the future has produced a great falling-off of trade via Bushire, and the customs receipts have diminished correspondingly. Except at Tabreez, nowhere in the provinces is there any sign of activity on the part of the Oonstutionalists, and the country as a whole seems to acquiesce, somewhat sullenly, in the existing state of affairs. Even the knowledge of the disapproval expressed by the spiritual chiefs of the Shias at Najef of the Shah’s coup d’Etat has produced as yet no visible effect. In Tehran there has been perfect tranquillity, and the cessation to some extent of the domiciliary visitations and petty persecutions has produced a certain return of confidence. Thus here and there a few of the boldest of the Nationalists have recommenced to hold secret meetings, and a few of the leaders of the party still left at Tehran occasionally collect at Sani-ed-Dowleh’s house, hut it is doubtful whether political affairs hold a prominent place in these discussions, as the conclaves are disapproved of by the Shah and carefully watched by his agents. There is much speculation as to the modifications of the Constitution and Electoral Law which the Shah is said to be elaborating, but except that a “ Council of Empire ” has been formed—of w r hose powers and attributes no one seems to know anything definite, and which appears to have fallen flat—everything is wrapped in mystery. M. de Hartwig says that the Senate, which was provided for in the Constitution, is to be called into existence, but Ala-es-Sultaneh, who the Russian Minister considers would be an ideal President, tells me that he knows nothing of it, nor is he aware that there is any serious discussion of a remodelled Constitution. No doubt under the stimulus of the identic communication made to the Shah by the British and Russian Legations on the 8th instant, an announcement on the subject will appear at an early date. It is too soon yet to pronounce on the effect of that communication on the populace of the capital; hut it is to be hoped that it will revive the Nationalist spirit to take a practical part in the elections, but even should the Shah be so unwise as to disregard the friendly advice of the two Governments and refuse to convoke Parliament, it is unlikely that the popular party will find the courage to do more than close the bazaars in sign of protest. It is not easy to know precisely what goes on at Bagh-i-Shah, or what influence is uppermost with the Shah at any given moment, but it seems certain that Amir Behadur Jang, Sepahsalar-i-Azam and Minister of War, is virtually dictator of Persia. At the Council of Ministers, which meets daily in a tent in the garden, his is always the deciding voice, and it is he who carries to the Shah his own views, which he represents to be those of his colleagues. Ala-es-Sultaneh told me that he was practically unable to see the Shah except in the presence of Sepahsalar, whose interference in any question, however little he may he competent to discuss it, always prevails. Amir Behadur has his most formidable rival in Ain-ed-Dowleh, and it was probably owing to his influence that the latter was sent to the apparently hopeless task of subduing the revolutionaries in Tabreez, and it is currently believed that even now he is endeavouring to discredit the Govemoi-Geneial by thwarting his efforts towards conciliation. , . ^ ^ cn t w Amir Behadur appears to have only two objects, firstly, to induce the 8hah not to reassemble the Medjliss, and, secondly, to enrich himself. There is no expedient that is not being employed to obtain money nominally to carry on the Government, but really to fill the coffers of the Minister of War and his friends. Extortion, sale of Governorships and titles, and all the various devices common in the East are freely resorted to and I do not think it would he an exaggeration to say that since the beginning of July not less than 1,500,000 tomans must have been raised in this manner possibly very much more. Probably not more than a third of this reaches the Shah or is used for so-called public purposes, the remainder being divided up amono* the “ khalvat ” (entourage). Yet the Shah is told that no money is available, and fresh efforts are made in his name to squeeze more wherever it can be found. Both banks are refusing to advance money to the Government on any pretext whatever. _. 0 I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING.190 No. 255. Sir A.

Your telegram of the 17th instant. M. Tcharykoff, with whom I had to-day a long conversation, read me out various telegrams which had been exchanged between him and M. de Hartwig. The looting and destruction of Russian property at the post station were, so his Excellency explained to me, the work of the anti-Royalists, and not, as I had understood yesterday, the combined work of them and of the Shah’s forces. The lives of the Russian subjects in Tabreez were, he asserted, in peril, as were also the Russian institutions established there—the Consulate, bank, &amp;c., and there was at present at Tabreez no proper security. The force to be sent was the minimum possible, he added. Proclamations would be issued everywhere, on its departure from Julfa, that it was on its way to Tabreez simply with the object of giving protection to Russian subjects and institutions, should it be required. M. Tcharykoff said that most stringent instructions would be issued that the force was to undertake no kind of interference in Persian internal affairs; as soon as some guarantee was afforded that security existed, it would be recalled. M. Tcharykoff assured me most categorically, when I spoke to him in the sense of your above-mentioned telegram, that, if the objects of the step taken by the Govern ment were regarded in such a manner, these views were entirely opposed to the facts of the case. It was impossible for the Russian Government to wait till the murder of some Russians had occurred, and much more serious measures would have to be taken if such an event as that took place. His Excellency asserted that the measures now being taken by the Russian Government were simply precautionary in character, and he added that he felt sure that in the event of a like case arising in the south of Persia the same measures would be adopted in similar circumstances by His Majesty’s Government. Not the slightest desire nor intention existed on the part of the Russian Government to intervene in Persian internal matters; it was indifferent to them by whom security at Tabreez was established, as long as it was established. The idea of their wanting to re-establish the authority of the Shah or crush the Nationalist party was out of the question. I told his Excellency that I did not give these views as the opinions of His Majesty’s Government, but I said that they might be held in many quarters in England. M. Tcharykoff replied that he earnestly hoped that His Majesty’s Government would do all in their power to remove misconceptions of this nature, and to represent in its real and true light the step taken by the Russian Government as being a reinforcement of the Consular guards for the protection in a time of danger of Russian subjects and institutions. There were, his Excellency added, from 300 to 500 revolutionaries from the Caucasus in Sattar Khan’s force, and great mischief was caused by them. In reply to my inquiry as to why they were not kept at home by the Russian authorities, his Excellency said that to guard a long and mountainous frontier was an impossibility. The limited object of the dispatch of the force, as well as the fact that there is no intention to intervene or interfere in Persian internal affairs, will be announced here in the “ Official Gazette.” His Excellency gave an affirmative reply to my question as to whether his Consul-General at Tabreez really held the danger to be serious and imminent. To induce the Russian Government to revise their decision would, I think, be impossible. They seem convinced that they w r ould incur grave responsibility if they ignored the danger, of the existence of which they appear sure.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey— {Received October 19.)

The above had been telegraphed to the Russian Minister at Tehran, and he had been also informed that, unless the Russian Consul-General at Tabreez called for the force, it would remain in Russian territory. The Consul-General had been instructed that, unless he was convinced that the lives of Russian subjects or of other Europeans were in imminent danger, he was not to call for the detachment. No. 271.

I authorize you to act as proposed, working in conjunction with M. Hartwig. CONSTITUTION in Persia. I have received your telegram of to-day’s date, and in consequence have sent instructions to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Russian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs should be informed of this. I AM informed by M. Tcharykoff that M. de Hartwig has received instructions to the effect that no direct appeal for assistance to the Russian troops at Julfa is to he made either by him or by the Russian Consul at Tabreez, but that, should the lives of Russian subjects be in any danger, the Russian Government is to be informed, and such orders as may appear expedient will be issued by the latter. It seems preferable, in M. Tcharykoft’s opinion, that, in view of the improvement of the situation in Tabreez, control over the movements of the Russian troops should remain in the hands of the Russian Government. I said 1 quite concurred in the view that the decision as to whether assistance was necessary or not should rest with the Central Government, and not with their Agents in Persia. M. BIZOT called on me on the 25th instant and said that he had been summoned to the Shah’s camp that morning and had been requested to find some means of raising a considerable sum of money, which was urgently required to pay and feed the troops at Tabreez. It was first pressed on him that he should try to obtain the advance of 400,000/. from Great Britain and Russia; but on his pointing out that the Persian Government had shown no intention whatever of fulfilling the conditions which the two Governments attach to the advance, and that therefore he could not recommend the proposal to the two Legations, the Prime Minister then inquired if M. Bizot could not assist the Government to raise money if he, Mushir-es-Sultaneh, pledged his jewels as security. M. Bizot said that he could not of course prevent the Minister from raising money in that manner, as a personal transaction, but that he must in every way discountenance any attempt of the Government to obtain funds indirectly by this means. . .

I agreed also in his view that the only way to put an end to the ruinous and crazy efforts of the Government to obtain money was to make its acquisition as difficult as possible, while letting it he understood that the sole hope of obtaining pecuniary assistance from the two Governments or the hanks lies in accepting a reasonable measure of reform. The same afternoon M. Bizot consulted both the Russian Minister and the Russian Pinancial Agent, and, finding them both of the same opinion as himself, it was arranged, subject to my concurrence, that M. Bizot and M. Ostrogradsky should call on the Prime Minister the following day and tell his Excellency that so long as the existirqg regime in financial affairs continues the Goyernment need not look for any assistance either from the Legations or the banks. The two gentlemen fulfilled their mission at Baghd-Shah on the following day. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 278. Mr, Marling to Sir Edward Grog.—[Received October 26.) Sir, Tehran, September 30, 1908. WITH reference to my despatch of the 10th September, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a note dated the 18th instant from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, embodying the Shah’s “dastkhatt” in reply to the identic communication from the British and Russian Legations, advising His Majesty to take steps to convoke the Medjliss on the 14th November, and to let his intention to do so be known in Tabreez. The reply when at last received was indeed scarcely distinguishable from a flat refusal to regard the advice of the two Powers. So unsatisfactory, indeed, was it that the Russian Minister felt impelled to send a message to the Shah insisting that His Majesty must take some immediate step to correct the bad impression which must be produced in London and St. Petersburgh, and to avoid more insistent representations by the two Legations. On the 21st instant M. de Hartwig succeeded in obtaining a half-promise that the modified electoral law would be published on the 24th instant, and that the Medjliss would be convened on the 1st (14th) November, the date specified in the identic communication, and on the 22nd instant the Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me and, referring to a private letter in which I had warned his Highness that the Shah’s reply could not be well received by His Majesty’s Government, asked me if the Shah’s promised announcement commended itself to me. I told his Highness that I was convinced of the wisdom of the step, as, I gather from a note I have received from him, was the Russian Minister also. Ala-es-Sultaneh then asked if I would be willing to discuss the political situation with the Shah, who, he said, was desirous of explaining his position to me. I said that considering that His Majesty had asked for my recall some two months ago it was strange that he should now be wishing to receive me, but that I was, of course, at His Majesty’s orders and an audience was accordingly arranged for the 21th. The Shah received me in a small double tent open all round and with heavily embroidered velvet on the inner roof. After inquiring after my health His Majestv expressed his regret that he had not seen me for so long ! It was some little tinA however, before His Majesty touched on political matters, and no sooner had I beomn to urge on him the expediency in his own interest of following the advice tendered by the Governments of Great Britain and Russia, than he assured me that the Imperial Rescript containing the new electoral law and announcing an early date for the elections and the meeting of Parliament would be published the same day. I said I was rejoiced to hear His Majesty’s wise decision, which could not fail to «ive the greatest satisfaction to His Majesty’s Government. The Shah then went on to speak ol the late Medjhss; he said that it was composed of ignorant and desmnnm men whose aim had been to create trouble directed against himself; that they had been supported by the equaRy evii and interested Anjumens ; that they had interfered in all kinds ol questions quite outside their competency, and that he' hoped that under the new electoral law a really useful Assembly would be created. I said that I ventured to differ from His Majesty on one point; the late Medjliss might have beenignoiant and meddlesome, but X was convinced that it was sincere in its desire to better the condition of the country. r J he JVEedjliss could, of course, be improved on, and I hoped that the electoral law about to be published would accomplish that. At any rate, by convoking a new Parliament IXis Majesty would give the lie to those whb pretended that he desired to abolish the Constitution and would put an end to the agitation which was distracting the country and paralyzing the Government. The origin of the cry for a Constitution had been the desire for good government, and now that Ilis Majesty was about to give proof of his sincerity to maintain the Constitution, it behoved him to lead the way toward reform. The Shah hastened to reply that he was firmly resolved to reorganize every Department of the Government, and intended to make a beginning with the Ministry of Finance, and would avail himself to the utmost of the services of the Financial Adviser, of whose ability and high character he had formed the most favourable opinion. I said that His Majesty could find no better counsellor than M. Bizot, but that, to judge from the opposition which he had hitherto encountered, he would find little assistance from the present Persian Govern ment. It was of the first importance that His Majesty should be surrounded by Ministers animated with the same desire as himself to introduce reforms. I feared there could be no question that His Majesty’s present advisers were very far from being so disinterested as could be wished, and I hoped that others would be found to replace them. One of the reasons of the failure of the late Parliament had been the lack of strong and capable Ministers who would have explained its true functions to it and guided it in its earlier days; but, unfortunately, none were forthcoming, nor could I see that matters in this respect were much better now. Beform, therefore, depended entirely on His Majesty himself, and I hoped he would make good use of an opportunity which offered itself to few Itulers, and which, if once lost, might not recur. The Shah replied that he was quite alive to the necessity of loyal co-operation on the part of Ministers, and he would take care that his wishes should be carried out, while the new electoral law would insure the return of intelligent and moderate Deputies, who would not interfere with the work of reform. The conversation then turned on other questions of a general character. The audience lasted about an hour and a quarter. When I reached the legation I heard a report that a Ilescript had actually been posted in the bazaar that morning, but on inquiry that rumour turned out to be unfounded. It seems, however, that some kind of announcement had been drafted, and even sent to be printed, but that its provisions were so unsatisfactory that the Shah had been advised to withdraw it. It is said that it fixed no date either for the elections or for the opening of the Medjliss; that it provided for a Senate and a Lower House ; but that the electoral law for the formation of the latter body was so framed that the Deputies would have been practically nominees of the Court party, and would have no representative character whatever. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 278. (Translation.) Ala-es-SuItaneh to Mr. Marling, Sir, September 18, 1908.

Now that they have written on the subject it is hoped that, at the time they have fixed, a Proclamation for the opening of the representative Medjliss will be issued, but, as it is written, this Medjliss will be after the restoration of order in Azerbaijan, when the Persian authorities can at their leisure arrange for the formation, convocation, and the opening of the Medjliss in question.

IN contirmation of Mr. Marling’s despatch of the 10th ultimo, I have the honour to state that little or no progress has been made during the last month in the negotiations which, as reported in my above-mentioned despatch, had been begun between the Delegates of the Nationalist party and the Governor-General at Tabreez. During a meeting which took place on the 11th ultimo, and at which the Governor-General clearly showed his unwillingness to make any concessions pending the complete submission of the insurgents, a force of Maku Kurds with several guns delivered a fierce attack on the north-west quarter of the town. The Nationalists, however, repulsed the Kurds, who abandoned their camp with one gun and twelve loads of ammunition. The losses on both sides are estimated at about 200. During the following week both sides remained inactive, until on the 22nd ultimo the Governor-General issued an ultimatum giving the Nationalists 48 hours in which to surrender, on the threat of bombarding the town. His Highness at the same time gave notice to the Consulates of his intention, and asked them to withdraw any of their subjects who should be among the insurgents, as he declined responsibility for their safety. _ Acting on instructions from Mr. Marling, Mr. Stevens replied that the European Christian quarter of the town being in the hands of the revolutionaries, and con sequently forming part of the threatened area, British subjects, though non-combatants, were by force of circumstances among the insurgents, and that he declined to waive the responsibility of the Persian Government for the safety of their lives and property. The period of grace expired at sunrise on the 24th ultimo without the insurgents having made any sign of submission, and in the afternoon of the same day the bombardment was commenced. The firing of the Shah’s forces, which can have had little effect on the buildings of the town, was continued on the two following days, and the Maku cavalry joined in the attack. The Nationalists, however, held their positions, and the attempt to crush the movement remained unsuccessful. Negotiations, in which the liussian Consul-General took part, were resumed, but, so far as I can learn, without any definite result. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. No. 280.

M ILEARYKOFI informed me this afternoon that he had some good news to give mfe it Was to the effect that thb reports which had been received from Tabreez w^ere ot a Inore favourable character, and gave hope that some semblance of order was being established. In these circumstances, the Russian Government had decided that the detachment of Russian troops should not proceed to Tabreez, but should remain at Julia He had informed M. de Hartwig by telegraph of this decision, and had told linn that the detachment would remain at Julfa unless summoned to Tabreez by theRussian Consul-General. He Rad also sent instructions to the latter functionary that he was not to call for the detachment unless he was convinced that there was imminent danger to the lives of Russian subjects or of other European residents, and that, if the necessity should arise for the presence of the detachment, he was to take measures that it should limit its duties solely and strictly to affording protection to the Russian and European residents, and was not to interfere in any way in the internal affairs or dissensions. He had specially mentioned “ European residents,” as he had understood, from a conversation which you had had with Count Benckendorff, that His Majesty’s Government desired that, should the occasion arise, other Europeans besides Russians should receive protection. I observed that I presumed that the Consul-General would not call for the detachment without previously referring to St. Petersburgh. M. Tcharykoff replied that this could hardly be done. Full responsibility must be left to the man on the spot, and he would not give orders to the detachment unless it was a matter of urgency, and, in that case, time would be of supreme importance. M. Tcharykoff said that the Consul-General had been thirty years in Persia, and could be trusted as a sober- minded man who would take calm and sensible views. I told M. Tcharykoff that the news which he had communicated was a great relief to me, and I was sure would be a source of gratification to you. No. 283. Sir Cr.

A deputation, consisting of some hundreds of persons representing all classes of the population, went to the Shah s camp and was there received by the Grand Vizier and other members of the Ministry. After reading to them telegrams which had been received from the provinces, including one from Tabreez, begging for the abandonment of the Constitution, the Couit officials then presented to the deputation, for their signature, a Petition in the same sense. All present, including the Ministers, signed this document, which was then carried to the Shah. His Majesty, after some show of reluctance, and a declara tion to the effect that he had been on the point of issuing the Electoral Law, promised that he would instruct the Grand Vizier in the sense desired by those who had signed the Petition. ^ a It is probable that most of the petitioners signed through fear of the consequences, or one or the Ministers tells me that he only signed on that account.

He has telegraphed, however, to the Russian Minister for a report. As the Legations presented the identic Memo randum yesterday, and as it would appear that the Shah has not actually abrogated the Constitution but has only instructed his Grand Vizier to meet the wishes of the petitioners in regard to its abandonment, there may be hope that he will still refrain from definite abrogation. I told M. Isvolsky that it seemed to me that, if the Shah really violated his promises, some serious notice of his action would have to he taken by the two Govern ments. He asked what form such action could take, and I suggested that perhaps the Russian officers might he withdrawn for a time by their Government, The Russian Government would thus prove clearly to the Shah that no help was to he expected from Russia, M. Isvolsky pointed out that there were grave objections to such a step : the Cossack brigade, deprived of its European officers, would he rendered quite useless for the maintenance of order, for there is still hope that the Shah may yet reconsider his promise to the petitioners. M. Isvolsky quite agreed with the view that the Petitions were not spontaneous, but had been manufactured to the order of the Court. No. 300. Sir Edivard Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.)

M. de Hartwig was received yesterday, and I to-day, in private audience by the Shah. Our representations were identic in the sense of your telegram of the 11th instant. We urged the Shah not to violate the pledges he had given to his people and to the two friendly Powers on account of the anti-Constitutional demonstration of last Saturday which had been organized. In reply, the Shah said that a very large section of the population regarded a constitutional regime as contrary to their religion and were consequently opposed to it. The artificial character of the demonstration of Saturday he denied, but assured me that on that occasion he had taken no decision. His Majesty asserted that personally he was in favour of an Assembly, but that it should not be one like the last, and that he was now endeavouring to devise a scheme for one which would be suitable. I pointed out that he was generally credited with having no intention of fulfilling his promises, and that if he w ere really in favour of a Constitution he was much maligned by public opinion. I ventured to disagree with His Majesty as to the feeling of the major part of his people, and I strongly emphasized the desirability in his own interest and in that of restoring peace in Azerbaijan, of promptly disabusing by an early fulfil ment of his pledges the public mind of the misapprehension as to his intentions which prevailed. No. 305. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—-(Received November 14.) (Telegraphic.) * St. Petersburgh, November 14, 1908. LAST night I had a conversation with M. Isvolsky on the Persian situation. His Excellency said that he was decided on tw r o points, namely, that Russia would not intervene nor support the Shah. The course of action from which he would abstain v r as clear enough, but he was perplexed as to what course of action he could follow' in order to remedy a situation which might once more drift into anarchy, and render intervention by the two Governments inevitable. It had occurred to him that lie might elaborate a project of reforms, and insist upon its execution in accord with His Majesty’s Government. He said that he had been thinking over my remarks with regard to the recall of the Russian officers of the Cossack Brigade, but had come to the conclusion that in the present circumstances such a step w r ould be hazardous. M. de Hartwig had already started for St. Petersburgh. M. Isvolsky’s intention was that a Departmental Committee should be appointed to study the Persian question with a view' to proposing some sort of remedy for the present situation. I promised M. Isvolsky that I w 7 ould telegraph to you a brief summary of our conversation, and suggested that perhaps you, after consulting those on the spot in Persia, might be in a position to bring forward some proposal as to what further steps could be taken with a view to improving the present state of affairs.Sir G.

I have been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the institution of a Council to be appointed by His Majesty is contemplated by the Shah. I have expressed my disappointment that the Shah should in such a fashion seek to evade his pledges, and I have pointed out that it is an essential feature of any constitutional regime that there should be an Assembly elected by the people. The two or three Ministers to whose sinister influence the present deplorable state of the country is largely due would have complete control over the Council it is proposed to appoint. I think that, should no satisfactory measure be announced during the next few days, further steps at Bagh-i-Shah should be taken by the two Legations. The action of the two Legations should, I am of opinion, be taken in common. The Shah, who would talk more freely and openly to our dragomans than to the Representatives, might be asked to receive them, and our representations mio-ht usefully take the form of a frank conversation. It would be the task of the dragomans to endeavour to make His Majesty under stand that the two Governments were equally desirous of seeing the tranquillity of Persia restored and her prosperity safeguarded, and that by urging the establishment of a constitutional regime they were best helping him to realize these objects. The lines of the previous representations would be followed by the dragomans in their conversation, and they would press His Majesty to consult the few men capable of giving good advice as to what form the Assembly best suited to the needs of the country should take.

THE Shah continues to reside in the military camp formed on the 4th J une at Bagh-i-Sliah. Amir Bahadur, the Sepahsalar or Commander-in-chief, is still to the front, and the reactionary regime is in full swing. Colonel Liakhoff is still Military Governor of Tehran, and the police force is now under his orders and is paid regularly through him. The Civil Governor, Prince Moayed-ed-Dowleh, G.C.M.G., has shown some disposition to resent Colonel Liakhoff’s interference in matters which he considers do not pertain to the Colonel s official sphere. It was generally felt, as reported in the last summary, that the Shah s rescript promising an electoral law for the 27th October and the opening of the second National Assembly (described in the rescript as “ an Assembly ) was not intended seiiously and that it had been wrung from him, more as a matter of form, hy the joint representations of the British and russian Legations. As the time drew near for the issue of the promised electoral law, inquiries were made as to whether oi not steps had been taken to elaborate such a document, but, although the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated to His Majesty’s Minister that it was actually ready, it was quite clear that he was only obeyino * 1 orders in making this statement and that he himself had not seen the document, nor could he or any one else throw any light on the subject. In the meantime, as the time approached for the fulfilment of the Shahs promise, various reports obtained currency which clearly emanated from the Court, to the effect that the provinces had telegraphed declaring that they did not wish for a new Parliament. On the 28th October, the Shah’s printer stated that the electoral law was under the press and would be published the following day, but later gave out that the publication had been [1072] Ppostponed indefinitely. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, when questioned on the subject, stated that he and his colleagues had spent the whole day on the 26th October elaborating the law, which had been completed, but was again being modified. The clergy of Nejef havn sent a very violently worded telegram to the Shah stating that his “ conduct wounds the heart of the believer, and is an offence against the absent Imam,” and that they would “ leave no stone unturned to obtain a represen tative Government.” The message ends with the following passage : &lt;c God has cursed the tyrants; you are victorious for the moment, but you may not remain so.” A translation of this telegram has been received from His Majesty’s Representative at Bagdad, and copies have been, it seems, widely spread at Tehran. M. Sabline, the new Russian Councillor, is expected here in a week. (Signed) G. P. CHURCHILL. November 4, 1908. Meshed. His Majesty’s Consul-General has recently received many requests from Consti tutionalists for permission to take refuge in the Consulate-General, all of which have been refused. Ispahan. All roads from Ispahan, the Tehran road excepted, are in the hands of robbers, and robberies of posts and caravans are frequent. Yezd. Prom the reports of His Majesty’s Acting Vice-Consul it appears that robberies are taking place daily on all roads leading to Yezd. The Governor has expressed himself unable to cope with the situation, trade is at a standstill, and the postal service entirely disorganized, the only posts recently received at Yezd being some which had remained in hiding in a village for some time and took advantage of the chance passing of the new Governor of Kerman to travel into Yezd with him. Kerman. Nazim-et-Tujjar took refuge in the British Consulate early in September, but left after a few days. Sahib Ekhtiar, the new Governor, arrived on the 21st September. He has appointed Moez-ed-Dowleh Deputy Governor and Saad-es-Sultaneh Vizier. Robber bands from Pars have looted several villages in Kerman district, and most of the roads are infested with robbers.

His Majesty s Resident and Consul called on him ou the 24th, when his manner was friendly and he showed himself prepared to discuss matters which were pendin 0 * in a reasonable spirit. He called on the Resident and Consul on the 13th October and was very friendly, but his health is not good, and most things are left in the hands of 8erdar 1 irouz and Ata-ed-Dowleh. the latest reports show that the Governor-General has betrr quite unable to restore order in bars, and His Majesty’s Consul is of opinion that the only remedy would be the appointment of a stronger man. On the 26th October Mr. Bill telegraphed that he had learnt that a plot was on foot to expel the Governor- General and demand a Constitution. The troops were reported to have refused to march against the Arab tribesmen, on the ground that they had neither food nor cartridges. On assurances of immunity being given by the Governor-General some of the refugees left the Consulate, but four still remained on the 7th October Many robberies are reported on the Bushire and Ispahan road.' Several posts have been robbed between Ispahan and Shiraz. On the 8th October the Chahar Mahal Regiment took refuge in a body at the Persian telegraph office demanding arrears of pay.

IN continuation of my despatch of the 2nd ultimo, I have the honour to report that during the first week of October the relations between the Governor-General of Tabreez and the Nationalist party showed no signs of improving, and the various attempts which were made to arrive at a solution of the difficulties of the situation were unavailing. It was, moreover, clear that Ain-ed-Dowleh had little intention of seeking by timely concession to conciliate the Nationalist party, and, moreover, by closing the gates of the city and allowing none of the necessaries of life to be brought into the town, he, while producing great distress amongst the people, aroused the indignation of all classes of the population. On the 9th a simultaneous attack was made by the Nationalists on the Governor- General’s camp and on the Maku cavalry, who were holding the Aji Bridge near one of the gates of the town. The fight, which continued for some ten hours, resulted in a complete Nationalist victory, the Maku cavalry being routed and the Moyalist camp thrown into great confusion. In the course of this fight the Russian telephone station near the Aji Bridge was the scene of much bloodshed, and about forty Maku Kurds were there killed. On the 12th the Davachi quarter of the town, which until then had bee in the hands of the Royalists, surrendered, and the leading Mujtehed and Shuja Niz°m, the leader of the Maraud cavalry, together with all the Royalists, fled. Their houses and the celebrated Anjuman Islamieh, the head-quarfers of the reactionaries, were looted and burnt. From this time the city has been in the undisputed possession of the Nationalists. The Royalist troops under Ain-ed-Dowleh were removed to some 15 miles from Tahreez. Ain-ed-Dowleh was dismissed and Ferman Ferma appointed to succeed him, hut, on the latter’s refusal to take up office, Ain-ed-Dowleh has since been reinstated. By the 18th October the Russian Government had decided to send in 80 or 100 Persian Cossacks and two companies of infantry, hut eventually abandoned their intention. Since the victory of the Nationalist party the situation in Tahreez has on the whole improved, and the bazaars were reopened on the 28th October, but the trade of the town continued to suffer considerably owing to the action of Shuja Nizam, who, after his flight, returned to Marand and held up the Julfa road until, on the 28th, a bomb was sent to him by post which killed both him and one of his sons. Since his death traffic on the road has been much hindered by a surviving son, who has proclaimed himself Governor of Marand, and the road to Erzeroum has also been very unsafe owing to the presence of brigands from Maku. I should add that since the final defeat of the Royalists the Nationalist leaders have addressed telegrams to the Shah and the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressing their loyalty to His Majesty and announcing to his Highness their intention to do ail in their power to protect the interests of foreigners in the town. Copies of these telegrams were sent to most of the foreign Missions in Tehran. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. No. 317. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.— -(Received November 23.) gq, St. Petersburgh, November 9, 1908. I CALLED on M. Isvolsky this morning to inquire what news he had received from Tehran in regard to the intention of the Shah to abrogate the Constitution, as, from Sir G. Barclay’s telegram of the 8th November, the accomplishment of the act seemed to be imminent. i tt ^ • t I found that M. Isvolsky had received no news at all from M. de Hartwig, so 1 read to him the substance of Sir G. Barclay’s above-mentioned telegram and I told his Excellency that subsequent to that telegram I had received another from lehran statino’ that the identic Memorandum had been handed in to the Persian Minister tor Foreign Affairs yesterday ; and as the Shah apparently had only promised to instruct [1072] * 2the Grand Vizier to meet the wishes expressed in the petitions against the Constitution, it was just possible that the Shah might reconsider his position. At the same time the abrogation of the Constitution, if persisted in, would in all probability lead to grave consequences ; and in any case, in view of the advice which had been so often given to the Shah by the British and Kussian Governments, such an act on the part of His Majesty should be viewed very seriously by both Governments. It seemed to me that the Shah should be in some way given to understand that he could not lightly disregard the counsels which had been proffered. M. Isvolsky fully recognized the gravity of the situation, but he said he could hardly be expected to form a definite opinion until he had received some report from M. de Hartwig, for which he had telegraphed, as to what actually had occurred. He said he would like to know what steps I could suggest to mark the disapproval of the two Governments. I told him that it was a little difficult to indicate the measures which might be most appropriate. Mere protests would probably have but little effect, but perhaps if the Bussian Government were to withdraw their officers for a limited time the Shah might comprehend that he could expect no assistance of any kind from Russia. M. Isvolsky, who did not reject the suggestion absolutely, said that there were grave objections to such a step. It might be better to await further and fuller information as to what had actually occurred ; and the public telegrams treated the question as if the presentation of the petition was merely preparatory to some action on the part of the Shah, and had not stated that he had actually given his consent to the Constitution being abandoned. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 318. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 23.) Sir, St. Petersburg//, November 12, 1908. M. ISVOLSKY read to me to-day portions of a long telegram which had arrived from Tehran, but which he told me had not been sent by the Legation, giving a very gloomy picture of the situation in the Persian capital. I told him that it was necessary, in order to calm the populace, that the Medjliss should assemble, and perhaps some means could then be found to improve the situation. The main point was that the elections should be held, and the Assembly convened, and I trusted that, as a result of the audiences which I understand the British and Russian Ministers were to have of the Shah to-day, we should see that the efforts of the reactionaries were defeated. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 319. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 23.) St. Petersburg//, November 14, 1908. M. ISVOLSKY spoke to me last night in respect to the situation in Persia, which continues to fill him with uneasiness. lie said that he had made up his mind on two points, which were non-intervention and no support to the Shah. This might be termed the negative side of a policy, but he was perplexed as to a positive policy. He saw quite clearly what he would not do, but he was puzzled as to what he would do. He did not view with satisfaction the possibility of the country drifting again into anarchy, which might give rise to events which might compel both Governments to intervene. He had thought of drawing up a project of reforms which, after consultation with His Majesty’s Government, could be urged upon the Shah ; but it seemed to him of little use to draw up projects when there were no men and no parties in Persia competent to put them into execution. M. de liar twig was on his way, or would be very shortly on his way, to St. Petersburg!!, and on his arrival he thought of instituting a small Departmental Committee who might be able to draw up some scheme which would offer some remedy to the situation.He was glad to say that the V iceroy of the Caucasus was acting in accord with him as to abstaining to the last moment from any intervention, tried as had been the forbearance and patience of the Russian Government. He had also been thinking over the suggestion which I had made to him of the withdrawal of the Russian officers as a mark of the displeasure of the Russian Government, but he feared that this would be a hazardous step to take in present circumstances, as without their presence no reliance could be placed on the Persian Cossack brigade to preserve any semblance of order. At the same time something should be done to relieve the present situation. The Shah appeared to be shuffling in regard to the electoral law and the convocation of the Assembly. This afternoon M. Isvolsky again recurred to the position of affairs in Persia, and especially to the condition of Azerbaijan. He said that Sattar Khan had appointed a Governor at Persian Julfa, who had displayed a red flag, and had been instantly joined by 100 or 150 revolutionaries from Russian territory. It was true that the trade routes were now open, but Russian subjects were being continually exposed to vexations and threats in Tabreez itself; and he was being reproached for sitting still and doing nothing. M. do Hartwig had reported that his advice and that of Sir G. Barclay had made some impression on the Shah ; but no definite steps had as yet been taken by the latter to meet our wishes. Moreover, if the Assembly did meet, it would do nothing but agitate, and he did not look to it being able to restore affairs to a normal condition. I told M. Isvolsky that we fully recognized the great forbearance which Russia had shown and was showing in exceedingly trying circumstances; and he doubtless had noticed that full testimony had been borne by the Prime Minister to the patience of Prussia and her loyal observance of the Convention. I thought we should continue to insist on the promulgation of the electoral law and the convocation of an Assembly; and if these measures were carried out, some alleviation of the situation might be produced. I told him that I had telegraphed to you a summary of the observations which he had made to me yesterday night; and I would let him know your reply directly I received it. The situation in Azerbaijan is doubtless causing the Russian Government anxiety, especially on account of the independent action which Sattar Khan adopts, and the active sympathy which is being shown for him and his cause by revolutionaries in the Caucasus. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 320. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received November 23.) St. Petersburgh, November 18, 1908. I SHOULD report that M. Isvolsky again mentioned to me to-day, as indeed is the case at nearly every interview which I have with him, the difficulty which he is experiencing in resisting the appeals wdiich are made to him for some protection^of Russian interests in Azerbaijan. He told me that the commerce of Russia is suffeiing severely, and that Russian subjects are being threatened and troubled, and he does not know wdiether he will be able to preserve a passive attitude for very much longer. Ihe Russian press w r ere occupying themselves with the subject, and were calling upon the Government to take some measures. Sattar Khan w r as in a sense the master ot the situation, but he was really governed by the Caucasian revolutionaries, who were ready foi? cLuv miscliiot* This mornino’ both the “ Novoe Yremya” and the “ Bourse G azette ” have articles on the condition of affairs in Azerbaijan. The former journal says : “ Owing to Russian non-interference in Azerbaijan and the impotence of the Shah, the position o Sattar Khan in Tabreez is becoming firmer, and the situation more chaotic. In time '•one by Russia would certainly have acted differently, Khiva, Kokand, and Jur- comania lost their freedom for having attacked Russian caravans. But nov^ times have changed. Russian commerce continues to suffer, and for how long is this state of affairs to last ? If England had been in the position of Russia she would not have been so patient. Besides the inevitable material losses which Russia has suffered, there is the loss of moral prestige. If only Sattar Khan confined himself to his quarrel with the Shah instead of adopting a persistently hostile attitude towaidsllussia, no one could complain. There is further a danger to Russia in respect to the 'trans-Caucasian Tartars, who are carefully watching events at Tahreez, and who already regard Sattar Khan as a hero.” The “ Bourse Gazette” says, whether M. de Hart wig returns to Tehran or not, there is no doubt that neither the interests nor the prestige of Russia has been adequately defended. The journal is unable to understand why Russia remains a passive spectator of events in Persia. If not to-day then to-morrow Azerbaijan will declare its independence, and then Russia will have a new unruly neighbour. The u Bourse Gazette ” considers that Russian diplomacy should categorically demand the convocation of the Assembly, and in conjunction with England take upon itself the task of pacifying Persia. Russian policy in Persia must become more energetic if Russia does not wish the opportunity to be taken advantage of by Turkey. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. No. 321. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 23.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 23, 1908. THE Shah and Constitution. My telegram of yesterday. I have discussed the situation at length with M. Sabline, and I consider that it would be best if the two Representatives were to ask the Shah for a joint audience, at which we should make the following demands: (1) That the Grand Vizier and Amir Bahadur Jang, to whom the reactionary policy of His Majesty must be chieHy ascribed, may be removed; and (2) that a Decree re-establishing the Constitution mav be issued. No. 322. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 23, 1908. THE action taken by you, as reported in your telegram of yesterday, with regard to the Rescript lately issued by the Shah is approved. No. 323. Sir Edward, Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. (Telegraphic.) ^ ... Foreign Office, November 23, 1908. THE Persian Constitution having been abolished by the Shah’s last Rescript, the Russian and British Governments must give the situation in Persia, which has arisen from this measure, their careful consideration. ^ I fully realize the iorce of the objections to withdrawing the Russian officers from 1 eh ran. On the whole it seems to me that the best thing to do would be to allow the Nationalists in Persia to exercise pressure on the Shah. This might be effected if the two Representatives made a joint communication to the Shah to the effect that we now propose to rely on the Nationalist forces in Azerbaijan for the protection of trade and foreigners, seeing that His Majesty has proved himself incapable of establishing his authority there and has destroyed all chance of himself keeping order through the deliberate non-fulfilment of his engagement respecting the Constitution; and further, that in the event of any other disorders arising out of attempts to reassert his position while the Constitution, which alone can be looked to as a means to remedy the state of anarchy in the northern provinces, is not in force, we shall hold him entirely responsible. Ihe best course appears to me therefore to be to abstain from intervention in Persian internal affairs and to let the natives arrive at a solution among themselves, butshould the more powerful party in Azerbaijan maintain an unfriendly attitude towards Russia, I realize the difficulty of adhering to this policy of non-intervention. These views should he communicated to M. Isvolsky with the request that if he approves them the Russian Representative at Tehran may receive instructions to act accordingly. No. 324. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 23, 1908. AS result of our representations of 22nd November, Shah has ordered suppression of Rescript. In these circumstances we are asking for an audience for the two dragomans, who will make the representations authorized by your telegram of 20th November to St. Petersburgh. No. 325. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 25, 1908. I HAVE received a visit this morning from the Minister of Foreign Affairs who called by command of the Shah. He told me that our joint representations of last Sunday had caused His Majesty great annoyance, especially the passage in the note about the evil counsels of his entourage. Ala-es-Saltaneh then proceeded to explain away the recent Rescript which, he said, was no more than the Shah’s answer to a petition from the Ulema. ^ It was not an official Decree, and so far as his Highness knew it was not by the Shah s command that it had been printed. Besides this, it only rejected the idea of a Medjliss like the last. His Majesty was still resolved to grant a Medjliss suited to the country and in accord with Mahommedan law as promised in his Decree of the 2nd Octobei. Ala-es-Saltaneh endeavoured to induce me to ask for a private audience for myself instead of the audience which we had asked for for the two dragomans, but I pointed out that my last private audience had been productive of no results, and I gave him to understand that my next audience would be a joint one with my Russian colleague and under instructions from my Government. It was with the object of rendering such a formal audience unnecessary that 1 wish the diagomans to see the Shah alone and have a frank conversation with him. His Highness consented to take His Majesty’s pleasure. ^ Ala-es-Saltaneh again spoke of the approaching establishment of a kind of Council of State. No. 326. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received November 27.) (Telegraphic.) Petersburgh, November 27, 1908. SITUATION in Azerbaijan. Your telegram of the 23rd instant. Last night M. Isvolsky spoke to me on the state of affairs in this province, lie said that since February no tolls had been taken on the Julfa-Tabreez road, which had cost about 10,000,000 roubles to make. Russian subjects had already sent in claims amounting to about 150,000L This state of things was greatly troubling the Minister of Finance, who was urging that Russian interests should receive some sort of protection. Anarchy was not diminishing but was rather increasing. With regard to the communication to the Shah suggested in your above-mentioned telegram, M. Isvolsky expressed the opinion that, in view of the Shah’s withdrawal of his Rescript, such a communication would be no longer necessary.216 No. 327. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received November 28.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 28, 1908. THE Shah and Constitution. A little time might, I think, be allowed to elapse before making any further joint formal representations, in order that the full effect of our strong joint action on the 22nd instant and of the audience to-day of the two dragomans may be seen. The audience of the dragomans was not unsatisfactory. In reply to their representations His Majesty repeated that he had had no intention of abandoning all idea of an Assembly when he published his recent Rescript. He was now considering what on Hit to be done, and he should not be hurried in his deliberations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs would in due course inform the two Legations of the result of these deliberations, but he could at once say that a Council, which would meet to-morrow had been appointed. The dragomans pointed out that an elective body was what was chiefly needed, and urged that the drawing up of a scheme for a suitable representative body should be intrusted to the Council. There is no doubt that it will require pressure to induce the Shah to consent to the Council being given this task, but it seems to me the line of least resistance, and it would, I think, be best to utilize the Council as a step towards a Medjliss, though, of course, the success of this must depend to a large extent on the men who are chosen to form the Council.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100043128905.0x000003_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/260/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100043128905.0x000003</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/260/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Persia.
