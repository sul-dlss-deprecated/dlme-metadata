MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT, Berkeley Square House, Sin 4 ‘ ‘t, ija Berkeley Square f id Dear Nind, London, W.l. 25th May, 1943# i Please refer to Savi n yrain No. 1 499 from regarding the appointment of an agrTcuIturaJTexpert for Muscat. You will note that the Sultan of Muscat wishes to make his territory self-supporting if possible in cereals, and has asked for an expert to advise him on the subject. The M.E.S.C. support his request but are unable to offer any suitable personnel at the moment. I We are, of course, directly interested in their 4-u/ /attempts to grow more cereals in the^Poroioft QuHf as the 'M.E.S.C. is now responsible for supplying their requirement of imported cereals, but I do not think it is primarily our duty to provide personnel for this area. It seems that any experts should be drawn from India if possible, and I hope that you will take this matter up with the Government of India and do all that you can to encourage the increased cultivation of cereals in the area. I notice that the Savingram has been repeated to the Government of India but you might consider it worthwhile to put a direct request to them for assistance. Yours sincerely, / ^ * E. D.
