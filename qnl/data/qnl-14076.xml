In the left-most corner of the courtyard a figure can be seen emerging from one of the doors.Beyond the compound, in the middle-ground, there is a green area occupied by trees, including at least one palm.Upon close inspection much architectural detail can be observed, even in the far distance along the horizon. For instance, it is clear that the majority of the structures visible are flat-roofed dwellings with roof terraces protected by fencing, or by high parapets punctuated with latticed sections, allowing air to circulate.InscriptionsLower right, in pencil, alongside image: ‘84’Below image: ‘The Town looking East from British Residency. 23 Feb. 1902’</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuk-I-Mund</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras Tannura</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ra's Tannūrah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zellaq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Az Zallāq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Jufayr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Landscape photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023515398.0x000003#share">Unknown</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
