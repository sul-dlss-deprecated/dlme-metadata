Manners reports that Afeerat [Fuwairit] was almost deserted, as was Wukruh [al-Wakra], and that most inhabitants of these towns had moved to Ed Biddeh [al Bidda]. Manners reports that he met the three sheikhs of Fuwairit, al-Wakra and Doha at al Bidda, but did not demand payment from them because of the financial security put up by the Sheikh of Bahrain (f 37). Manner also reports that he conducted surveys of the bay at Al Bidda while there.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673698.0x00001c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
