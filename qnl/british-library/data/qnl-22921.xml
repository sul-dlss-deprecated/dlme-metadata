Adviserate ■ary 24, 1947. / Regarding the newspaper statement made ifi Tehran referred to in your D.O. No.C/24Sedated 23rd February, is it possible that they referred to their own school? There is a Persian school in Manama which has existed for about 25 years and in the past we used occasionally to have some trouble with its authorities. They took to marching about with Persian flags, which we stopped, and I have reason to believe that certainly at one time the school received some assistance from Tehran. 2. Brief facts about our own schools are as follows:- There are nine boy* schools in Bahrain run by the Bahrain Government, of these nine is a Secondary school, four are primary schools, one a Technical school and four are village schools. In all schools, except the Secondary school, education is entirely free. Boys of all nationalities, including Persians, are admitted to all the schools. Arabic, the language of the country, is used in the schools. At the end of last term there were 1800 boys attending the Government schools. In addition the Government maintains a large hostel which provides accommodation for 50 boarders. The Director of Education for the last 18 months has been an Arab of Bahrain. There are five girls T schools where free, primary, education is provided and all nationalities attend, these are paid for entirely by the Government. The Confidential. 2 /—2 number of girls attending these schools at the end of last term was 1300. There are also two religious schools, Sunni and Shia, which are paid for by the Government. The expenditure by the Bahrain Government on education last year was Ks.5,68,754/-. In addition to Government schools there are in Bahrain, a Mission school for girls, two private Arab schools for boys, a Persian boys f school and numerous Matawaa schools. * 3. The statement is so ridiculous that I should have thought it was best ignored; it is similar to the sort of stuff that used to appear in the Persian press some years ago which we disregarded. Lieut.

In view of the present condition he considers that any increase in the Persian minority in Bahrain may have serious consequences in future. It is his wish to reduce the number of Persians who are now living in Bahrain and he therefore suggests that in future no permission should be granted to Persians resident here to visit Persia unless they are returning to their own country in order to stay there.

No. C/211 The 17th of February, 1943 Dear Belgrave. • You will remember that we spoke this morning about the question of Persians coming to Bahrain. Another aspect of it has cropped up. I refer to the Persians allowed to enter Bahrain on landing permits issued by the British representative (now Vice-Consul) at Bushire - the last reference to which appears to be your memorandum No. 1343-15 dated the 23rd June, 1946. 2. The position now appears to be that the Vice- Consul, Bushire, refers to me before issuing a landing permit for a person whom he recommends for treatment in Bahrain, but we have not completely reverted to the pro cedure which was in force prior to April, 1944, as I do not think I refer to you but, at my own discretion, inform the Vice-Consul, Bushire, whether he may issue the landing permit or not. T am as anxious as you are that the number of Persians should not increase in Bahrain by immigration, and particularly by using alleged sickness as an excuse for entering and staying here. I shall, therefore, do my best to scrutinise carefully all recommendations by the Vice-Consul and reject those which do not seem to be genuine. Nevertheless, if you would prefer that all such recommendations be referred to you, I would do so, though, for the reasons stated, T doubt whether the extra office work involved is necessary. Will you let me know whether you want them referred to you or not? 3. T doubt whether Easey, the present Vice-Consul, who is a doctor would recommend any but genuine cases. Yours sincerely. C.D.

Memorandum Reference Residency endorser,ent No.B/234, dated the 17th July, 1948. 2. ' A Certificate of Identity is a travel document issued to subjects of Qatar, the Trucial Coast Sheikh doms, Persians, and other nationals who cannot be is sued with an Emergency Certificate, and whose passports are either time expired or do not exist. They are issued here because the Bahrain Government would na turally refuse to admit a person who is not in possession of one giving him permission to re-enter Bahrain. 3. I believe that the Bahrain Government is prepared to face up to any retaliatory measures which the Persians may adopt against Bahrain subjects living in Persia. Major Stewart's letter does not seem to be intended for me as the reference quoted in the first line did not issue from my office. Furthermore the mention of the 'Soviet Government' in line 3 of paragraph 2, presumably refers to the Persian Government. (SGD) C.J. PELLY Political Agent, Bahrain ATTESTED for Assistant Political Agent, f 1 £. Bahrain.I have spoken to the Adviser about this case. 11. He informs me that a Persian can, in theory, travel to Bahrain 'oh a Persian passport provided it is endorsed for travel to Bahrain by*a British Consul in Persia. in point of fact, no Persian ever does this because, in view of the Persian claim to Bahrain, he would be afraid to have his passport endorsed in that way by a British representative. What they do do is travel to Sharjah or Dubai or perhaps Qatar, stay there for a fewjnonths, obtain nationality papers from the v ^.ocal Shaikh - possibly by the payment of Illegal gratification - and then travel here on those papers having them, I think, endprsed as valid for travel here _by the Residency Agent, Sharjah. The Adviser gives the confirmation asked for in IB. paragraph-3 of P.R. 's memorandum as the whole proposal only relates to -Persians . A man would be a Bahrain' subject had he taken out Bahrain nationality papers - not a Persian. - The only reply the Adviser can give me to para 4 13. of P.R.’s memo, is that in recent years 30 or 40 Per sians a year have become Bahrain subjects. The Adviser yesterday gai*e me the- information 14. contained in para 11 above. It does not, however, answer the P.R.’s question. This may. in fact, be a purely theoretical one since very few, if any, Persians, are officially allowed to land in Bahrain. Neverthe less, the Adviser told me that there is a large amount of correspondence on our files concerning the papers which, in the past, Persians had to get in order to land at Bahrain. Can C.C. find any correspondence relevant to the question 0 The one case I have seen in which a Persian was getting official permission to land in Bahrain was one in which Dr. Ease./ from Bushire asked whether he might give a No Objection Certificate (or some document of that sort, I cannot remember) to a sick person whom he said should go to Bahrain for medical treatment. This is the only case of the kind I have ever seen, and I am fairly convinced that there is, practically speaking, no such thing as ''official’' travel by Persians to Bahrain.

Please see pages 10, 34 and 94 of l/13-I and pages 145, 189, 192 and 197 of 1/13-1I for steps leading up to present passport restrictions against Persians. before 31/12/28 Persians could enter Bahrain with only an Ila-o-Khabar or chit from the Persian authorities allowing them to travel. After 31/12/28 Persians were required to be in possession of a visa from a British Consular authority. Correspondence between Adviser and this Agency is flagged on Passport files 29/17A Volumes I, III and IV. Please see also loose papers below taken from a court file, and page 188 of 24/l, and pages 24 and 30 of E.O. file 16/42. It will be seen from these that most of the Persian immigration is at present 'unnfficial'. In certain cases the Bahrain Government allow only the wives and small children of Persians employed in Bahrain to enter Bahrain.Brothers, sisters, and other relatives are not usually allowed to enter but exceptions have been made by Bahrain u overnment, vide pages 50, 115 and !§&lt; 123 of 29/l7A-III,^when this Agency has aflked for an entry visa to be issued, cf pagejf 92 of 29/17A-III. In certain instances applications for‘Certificates of Identity do not seem to have been referred to Adviser, vide page 226 of 29/17A- III. In future all applications should be referred to him. Correspondence regarding entry visas given on medical grounds is at pages 22, 66, 71, 106, 140, 333 and 338 of file 29/17A-III. Special regulations are in force for Persian labour required by local British firms, vide page 287 of 29/17A-I. Kegarding Persians on the Trucial Coast please see correspondence at pages 17 to 25 of 12/4. 15/3/48. P.AIt is above all things essential that this note and the letter from the Regency Council should not go on official * records. A.P.A. might ask the Adviser to ensure that his office copy of the letter does not appear on the Adviserate official records either. The Nationality Law, the Passport Regulations and so on have been framed in consultation with the Bahrain Government and it is quite impossible to consider officially a proposal providing a loop__hole for a certain class of Persians to evade the regulations framed. Surely 4 the Council MlJ- understand that it is impossible to frame a passport regulation which will provide for its own evasion by a totally undefinable class of foreigner. y 2. The first thing to do in examining this matter (privately and unofficially) is to ascertain the exact figures of the annual value of the animals, grain, fruit carpets for obvious reasons^nd then it is necessary to find out what quantity of these articles is imported by dhow and what quantity by ordinary straightforward means in the slow mail. 3. Then, in regard to the smuggling trade from Bahrain to Persia, who benefits from this ? I imagine that most of the smuggling is in piecegoods, and I should have thought that it would be the foreign merchants in Manama who would inatolMrr benefit. Of course the Customs do make something out of this trade when the goods are imported originally into Bahrain, but do they get the full 5 % or do they give a drawback when the goods are re-exported, and if the latter / do they really make very much out of the whole trade ? 4. Finally since it is a smuggling trade, and those dealing with it must obviously go to places on the Persian coast where there are/jua customs officials nor police, why 9 on earth should the carrying trade be $n the hands of and wood imported from Persia into Bahrain. I exclude neither 4 Persians and not Bahraini dhow owners ? 5/-- —S ■ -T* ''WK M RMHH1 T 5.
