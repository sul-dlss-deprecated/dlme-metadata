These 4x2 vehicles, details of which are shown on the attached, have a very poor cross country performance as coupared with the 4x4 types. You will no doubt wish to consider whether 4x2 vehicles should be offered to the Sultan* The alternative would be to make representations to the War Office or Air Ministry with a view to their releasing 5 4x4 vehicles from their stocks* With regard to the question of civilian type vehicles, it thought that those mentioned on the attached would be suitable to bring to the notice of the Sultan* Vie are ■^wideavouring to obtain literature giving fuller details from the firms concerned and will pass it on to you as soon as it is received. You will see that the prices quoted are ex-works (you will no doubt be in a better position than us to estimate shipping costs to Muscat) and are those normally charged to civilian buyers in this country.

The Sultan accepted these lorries provided they were brand new and prices not higher, reference Political Resident's telegram No. 1031 dated the 8th October 1947 to C.R.O. London Wtfin). C.R.O. then replied that they had found that the Canadian lorries were now out of stock and unsuitable but would make enruiries about obtaining new civilian type lorries reference Politic-1 Resident's P.L. No. 1932-S dated the 10th November 1947. As regards the tractors the C.R.O. quoted a price and offered delivery in 3 to 4 months reference C.R.O. telegram to P.R. No. 14335 dated the 20th November 1947 (3.138). The Sultan accepted the quotation and asked that an order should be placed. The Sultan mentioned this morning verbally that some difficulty has cropped up regarding the method of payment. Regarding Ford lorries the final outcome after one year's writing and correspondence is that after exhaustive enquiries the Air Ministry have agreed to make available from stocks (a) Bedford three ton type CLD - 4 wheel drive (b) Ford 30 cwt - 7.O.T. 3-2 wheel drive. As regards (a) - these were originally offered and not selected by the Sultan in Political Resident's letter No. 1138-S dated the 13th June 1947 (enclosure to S.V) the only difference being that it was then stated that the price was 620 Pounds Sterling whereas now the price is said to be 504 Pounds Sterling. As regards (b) - the Commandant has suggested that even the 4 wheel drive type Ford ''as unsatisfactory and the Sultan this morning mentioned that he ^ould like to buy jeeps which were quoted in Aden at 1700 dollars ( .T.) a car.! - 3 - In view cf* the followinj facts I recommend that instead of continuing this unsatisfactory correspond ence vdth a view to jetting apparently unobtainable British cars for the Sultan we let the Sultan have his 20,000 American dollars originally asked for to buy his vehicles:- (1) The Sultan has throughout insisted that S the vehicles supplied should be brand new and it now appears that the vehicles offered after a year are second hand. (2) The Sultan wanted a complete list of spares and the Air Ministry while promising to endeavour to see, the spares are made available are doubtful about rt least one important item - fuel pump. (3) Our promise almost a year ago today was that transport should be supplied within a reasonable time. While we are still corresponding there is no chance of a vehicle being delivered for at least another six months. Copy to P.R, Camp Muscat. ltd. 'A.C.S.'

I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a note prepared by Major Stewart, late Political Agent Muscat, on the subject of the motor vehicles which we have been endeavouring to obtain for His Highness the Sultan as an alternative to meeting his demand for 20,000 American dollars as part of his terms for the conclusion of the Air Agreement of April 1947. 3. I fully agree with Major Stewart that it is most un desirable to offer the Sultan second-hand vehicles with an inadequate supply of spares and that as so much time has elapsed and there appears no prospect of supplying him with vehicles of the type ho requires from British sources, we should hesitate no longer to let him have the dollars necessary for this purpose. 4. I ascertained during my recent visit to Muscat that the vehicles he now requires are*- (a) for his personal use in Dhofar, two 30-cwt trucks fitted with seats for passengers, and (b) for the Muscat Infantry two 15-cwt 4-wheeled drive Ford or Chevrolet trucks and four jeeps. 5. His original requirements were five Ford lorries and two Fordson tractors and these two Fordson tractors have been supplied from British sources at a cost tc the Sultan of £.962/16/6 d which is the equivalent of about 3,800 dollars, I consider therefore that we are now under an obligation to let him have up to 16,150 dollars against the 20.000 Dollars for which he originally asked. I do not know if this will cover all his present requirements of vehicle* but I suggest that he should be granted immediate permission to purchase his requirements as stated in paragraph 4 above from American sources and that any dollars in excess of the sum of 16,150 dollars mentioned in this paragraph should be set off againsl the Muscat dollar quota for 1948. » 6. I would add that I have consulted the Ford agent in Bahrain and that it appears unlikely that any of the vehicles of the types required can be obtained from the Ford Motor Company's works at Dagenham. You may, however, wish to confirm this before agreeing to my proposals. 7.
