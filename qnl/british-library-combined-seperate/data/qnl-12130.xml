Much of this correspondence relates to the purchase of a Montagu whaler boat (generally referred to in the papers erroneously as a 'Montague Whaler'), and to the purchase of replacement parts for the boat in the years that followed. The vessel was required as a replacement for the Political Agency's rowing boat, which had been wrecked in a storm.Correspondence towards the rear of the volume discusses the supply of a new boat for the Political Agency in Muscat to use for the duration of the Second World War and the construction of a new shed in which to store the Montagu whaler. Also enclosed are a number of replies to an advertisement in the
                           Times of India,regarding the purchase of a replacement motor for the whaler, which was placed by Major Reginald George Evelyn William Alban, the Political Agent in Muscat.The principal correspondents in the volume are officials from the Political Agency in Muscat, the Political Residency in Bushire, the Naval Store Officer of Her Majesty's Indian Marine in Bombay [Mumbai] and a number of private naval and timber contractors. The volume also contains a limited amount of correspondence between the Political Agency in Muscat and officials of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman that is in Arabic (accompanied by English translations).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Naval Store Officer, Bombay</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Boats</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000ea#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000ea#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000ea#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000ea#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
