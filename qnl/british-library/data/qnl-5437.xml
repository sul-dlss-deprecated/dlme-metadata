It will be seen from p. 11 of the attached statement of D &amp; C.expenditure for 1928-29 that the cost of the buildings at Kerman has been included, the authority quoted being the telegram from this Office of the 17th April 1928 P.1682/28). In the Government of India’s telegram of the 18th January 1928 (P.308/28) quoted it was stated that the expenditure would be divisible and the reply was evidently taken as agreeing with this. It appears from the papers that there was no question of departing from the decision communicated to India in the letter of the 3rd liarch 1927 (p.917/27) and accordingly that the debit in question must be deleted.

This water-supply is rented from a local merchant who is himself the mortgagee of 440 hours* water-supply from Sardar Husret, C.B.E., the former owner of the Consulate building. 3. His Majesty’s Consul for Kerman and Persian Baluchistan has now suggested that Government should take up the mortgage of the 440 hours water-supply from Sardar Husret for a sum of Tumans 4500 for a period of 4 years. At the present market rate, this will vary from Rs.10,000 to 11,250 approximately. Interest at 6% on this amounts only to Rs.600 to Rs.675 per annum which is less than the present rent, while at the same time the Consulate will be assured of a considerably larger supply of water which isreally needed. His Majesty^ Consul considers that there is no risk in accepting the mortgage and the Hon*hie the Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran fully support the proposal* The Government of India accordingly recommend the proposal for sanction. 4. The cost of the mortgage will he divisible between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India as the recurring saving of Rs*770 will likewise be shared by both* If and when the mortgage is redeemed the amount will be credited in moieties to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. The Political Resident, Bushire,suggests in a recent telegram that the rate of exchange at the present moment is very favourable for effecting the transaction and, in the circumstances, I am to request that the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the expenditure may be obtained and the orders of His Majesty’s Secretary of State communi- cated as early as possible* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, for Foreign Secretary to the Government of India* (With 2 spare copies.)PUT AWAY WITH (yoo ?-'■&gt; Telegram ii’o.1156, dated 14th November 1929 To Nr om No reign, New Delhi Resident, Nushire 7*}.

From iiajor ifi.V/.C. i^oel, C.i.E.,D.S.O., His Majesty’s Consul for Kerman and Persian Baluchistan, Kerman, To The Secretary to the non’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Bulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to submit proposals whereby the water supply for irrigating the Consulate garden, which is at present very inadequate, may be increased without any additional cost to Government. Last year the building which had been used as H.B.M* s Consulate Kerman for the last 34 years was purchased by Government from our old friend Sardar Lusret C.B.E. for Rs.75,362-5-0 of which approximately As. 26,000 represented the value of the land (about 5 acres). Land in Persia is usually sold with water rights but in the case of the Consulate they were not included but had to be rented for an annual sum of Tumans 280 (Ks.770). The rights in question consist in the use of the water of the ZLKISF Qanat for 280 hours a year. Before the building was purchased water for 256 hours a year was supplied by the owner for the inclusive rental of Tumans 700 a year. This water was insufficient and only half of the garden was irrigated, the rest being a parched up v/ilderness with a few stunted trees. nowever-1^ ilovvever the rental of Tumans 700 was ridiculously low being only half the market value so that none of the previous incumbents felt justified in asking the owner to give any further allowance. «»hen my predecessor the late ^r. Davies completed the sale of the property he increased the water supply by 24 hours during the summer months. The 280 hours at present rented is taken from a local merchant who is the mortgagee^ of 440 hours from Sardar .ausret for Tumans 3^140. Sardar husret was the owner of the Consulate and will be remembered as &amp;he xjnifltrafc staunchest / of our friends in herman. Although a wealthy man he is always short of ready cash and we would be doing him a favour and concluding a good bargain for ourselves if we redeemed his mortgage and became in turn usufructuary mortgagees of the water at an enhanced figure. unfortunately in this country the iCnglishman and especially a British Consulate has to pay considerabl/ above the market price for anything. Whereas Sardar liusret was prepared to accept Ts.3,140 as mortgage for 440 hours water from a Persian like uiuin-ut-Tujjar with whom for long he had had business connections, he would not be prepared to let the Consulate have it at the same figure. After some negotiations 1 find that he would be ready to mortgage 440 hours water to us for Tumans 4500. I submit that at this figure it would be well in Government interests to take up the mortgage. At the time of the purchase of the property ri.M’s Consul Kerman asked for a budget provision of Ra. 770 to cover the cost of irrigation water which up to now had been supplied free but which in future would have to be rented (vide this office letter ho.49/546 of June 17th, 1927). Prom this provision is paid the yearly water rent of Tumans 280 which represents 6.2&gt; on the suggested mortgage price of Tumans 4,500. IfIf Government would consent to take up the usufructuary- mortgage at this figure the Office Allowance could he reduced by its. 770 and the Consulate would obtain an adequate supply of water ^viz. 440 instead of the present 280, an increase of 57$) at the same price that it is paying at present. I would therefore strongly recommend that the present opportunity of taking up the mortgage on such favourable terms be seized and that I should be authorized to make an immediate advance of Tumans 4,500 to bardar husret and draw up a mortgage deed. sardar busret will agree to the period of the mortgage fixed at 4 years which gives Government a reasonable fixity of tenure, nowever even at the expiration of 4 years there is but little chance of the mortgage being redeemed. In the case of the Consulate the rent paid by Government remained at a very low figure for over 30 years owing to the fact of its being mortgaged to Government (vide paragraph 6 of this office letter i*o.48/539 of June 17th, 1927 The only risk that would seem to be incurred is that the M Zirisf M channel has now been in existence for several centuries. As an investment it is considered locally as 'marghub' i.e. gilt edged yielding only 5&gt;; the value of the water has steadily increased during the last 10 years by present depressed Kran exchange would seem to offer a favourable opportunity for a trans&amp;dion of this nature in Persian currency. The market value of 440 hours* water is Tumans 8,400 as compared to the proposed mortgage value of Turaans 4,500. the rate of hrans 365 per jis.100. This being the rate fixed the •^anat** will dry up or greatly deteriorate, however 40$, and is now 55$ above its pre-war price, moreover the In converting Krans to rupees I have throughout used asas the limit for Kran exchange Compensation seemed to be the fairest rate to take in submitting proposals of a permanent nature.

Sir, 1 have the honour to invite a reference to Consul Kerman’s letter i^o.65/759 dated the 24th August 1929 addressed to this office and copy sent direct to Poreign and Political Department, on the above subject, and to state that the proposal put forv/ar by iniajor X^oel has my full support. With the present favourable rate of exchange the payment for the mortgage will be equivalent to ns.11,250/- which at the Government rate of interest of 5# would yield hs.562/8/0* A sum of hs*770/- water rent is now paid annually from the Kerman 'bf ! Office Allowance Grant i.e. Rs. 207/8/0 more than the interest. This difference would be the actual saving to Government if Major Reel’s proposal is adopted and there would, in addition, be the advantage of having secured a larger supply of water for the Consulate Garden. In view of these favourable conditions I would recommend that the Government of India will be pleased to authorise the immediate conclusion of the mortgage. I have, etc•, 8 d. C.C.J.

His Britannic Majesty^ Consulate, Kerman, the 2 nd June 1928. From J.H. Davies, Esq., O.B.E., His Majesty^ Consul, Ke rman• To The Secretary to the Kon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to telegram No. 630,dated 17th May 1928 from the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the preparation of the sale deed for the purchase of this Consulate building and grounds. 2 . I have engaged the services of the Vakil who is xsqa reported to be the best in Kerman and I am assured that he is fully competent to draw up a deed satisfactory in Persian law. He is at present engaged in drawing up a draft deed on lines I have indicated. When ready it will be sent to the owners for approval• 3 . The deed is on the lines of the draft enclosed with my letter No. 51/579,dated 25th June 1927, (a copy of which was sent with my letter No. 580 of the same date to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India). The only new points included are the following. (i) The seller who owns the water at present supplied for the Consulate garden agrees to continue to supply the quantity now received (7 hours in 10 days) or such smaller amount as the buyer from time to time requires, at tne market ju&amp;gt rate each year and not to sell or alienate the said quantity of water without first giving the buyer the option of purchasing the water. (ii) The seller agrees not to sell or lease tne premises known as the ’'Andarun” and a small house and compound to the west, which adjoin the Consulate, without first giving the buyer the option of buying or leasing these premises.4. As regards this second point, iriiich is meant as a safe guard against tne occupation of the Andarun or the small house by some undesirable person, such as the Soviet Consul,! should explain that I am well aware that the Government of India would never consider purchasing or leasing these pre mises, should such a contingency arise. The object of this clause is merely to ensure that the seller does not sell or lease the “Andarun* 1 or the small house without the knowledge of H.M 1 s Consul; when any such intention comes to his knowledge it will depend on the continuance of friendly re lations between H.M«s Consul and Sardar Nusrat's family at the time whether the latter can be induced not to sexl or lease the property to an undesirable person. I am aware that the advantages secured by this clause are slight, but it seemed to be worth inclusion# 5. The other proposed alterations in the draft deed referred to above are mainly verbal to ensure conformity with the Persian law. In particular the following points have been borne in mind:- (a) Careful definition of the boundaries and public rights of exit and entry for purposes of water distribution. A sketch map shewing the boundaries is being prepared ana will be attached to the deed. (b) Careful definition of the buyer so that H.M's Consul for the tirae being will have full authority to take legal action in the interests of the property, if need be, without having to obtain a power of attorney ^from the Secretary of State. (c) Care that all the present oo-owners of the property are designated as sellers and sign the deed as such. The only heir of Haji Bibi is Sardar Husrat's wife and he assures me that he and his wife are the only owners of the property. I am taking every possible step to verify this. The signature of all theheirs of the two owners will also be(S) be affixed to the deed, as an additional precaution, though this is not strictly necessary. In any case, there is an indemnity clause, as in paragraph four of the draft deed previously sent. 6 . I have the honour to enquire whether, on completion of the draft deed in conformity with the above, I may proceed - to have the deed itself completed and signed without further reference to you. A separate document will also be executed terminating the loan transactions. 7 . I have also the honour to enquire whether the telegram from foreign quoted in telegram 579 dated 5th May, is suffi cient authority for the disbursement of the sum mentioned less the amount of loan outstanding. If so, will you kindly let me know the number and date of the telegram so that I may quote them in the disbursement order. If not, will you kindly request the Hon'ble the Political Resident to move the Government of xna India to pass the requisite order and supply me with a copy. I have no funds from which I can meet the amount in my budget, and I have the honour to request that the necessary provision may be made. 8 .

Special repairs to the buildings. ..•••• .1,200 . • QQO Water and garden contingencies For future years. Petty repairs to the buildings Water and garden contingencies 2,190 •••••**• i,090 2,190 3 . The average expenditure on petty and ordinary repairs during the years 1916-17 to 1926-27 was Es. 882 per annum. In addition a sum of Es. 3,521 was spent during the period on special repairs. In the circumstances, the proposed ejqpenditure of Es. 1,200 during the current year and of Es. 1,090 in future years on repairs to the buildings seems reasonable. 4garden contingencies, it is usual to make an annual grant for the upkeep of the garden at other Consulates. Hitherto the landlord has been paying,under a clause of the lease, a sum of Tomans 120, or Es. 330, per annum and the entire amount was spent on the upkeep of the garden. The landlord also supplied water free of charge for seven hours every ten days. The cost of renting the same quantity of water is Tomans 280, or Hs. 770, per annum, and as the year for the purpose of renting water begins in autumn and the rent is payable in advance, it is necessary that this expenditure should be incurred during the current year. An expenditure of Es. 1,100 per annum would thus be required for water and garden contingencies,viz. Es.770 for water and Es. 330 for garden contingencies. This amount compares favourably with the amounts sanctioned for Meshed and Sistan. The expenditure during the current year will be limited to Es*990 only. 5. The Government of India propose to sanction the provision of Es. 2,190 required for expenditure during the current year and to include a similar provision in the budget for future years. The expenditure will as usual be divisible in moieties between the Home and Indian Governments. I am to request that the sanction of His Majesty^ Government to the expenditure may be obtained and communicated by telegram. I have the honour to be.

With reference to the letter from the Deputy Secretary to the Governmentthe Government of India in the foreign and Political Department Uo.D*768-iM, dated 28th March 1927, a copy of which was forwarded with your endorsement Iio*60/887 dated 23rd April 1927, I have the honour to report the result of my negotiations with Sardar llusrat for the purchase of this Consulate, 2, In accordance with the local custom two expert and trust worthy masons were appointed to value the property. Their valuation was as followsr- Tomans, Buildings • 18,280 Land and Trees , • » • • 10,6 73 Total., 28,953 This is nearly 4,000 Tomans more than the owner’s estimate quoted hy my predecessor. That estimate however was not made by but Sardar ITusrat hiraself/by his son during the Sardar’s absence in Tehran, 3, As regards Jodi: the valuation of the land and trees (over one third of the total value), there can be no question, as the rate on which this has been calculated is the same as that accepted in the case of a rather inferior piece of property that changed hands last month. 4, As regards the buildings, I have checked the valuation carefully and it seems to me to have been reasonably made. In 1915 the total capital cost of the building alone, exclusive of the value of the land; was stated by the Consul here at that time to be Tomans 32,200 ( vide sum of Rs.90,200 shewn in the statement attached to j'oreign and Political Department letter Eo,705-i!lst , dated 8th April 1918). I have not been able to check the details of that calculation as some of the files appear to have been lost when the Consulate was evacuated shortly after the information was supplied; but as this figure was worked out within 10 / years of the commencement of construc tion it must be presumed to be accurate. 5, On the basis of the masons* valuation I discussed the matter with Sardar iiusrat and he eventually agreed to accept a reductionreduction of 10% i.e*, Tomans 26,000 in round figures. If I had chosen to regard him as a hard pressed debtor who must dispose of his property %t once in order to avoid bankruptcy it is possible that X might have induced him to accept a largeer reduction. This attitude however did not appear to lie to be a proper one to adopt towards an old friend of the British Government who has undoubtedly suffered much both financially and in prestige on account of that friendship. Moreover, it seemed to me politically advantageous to keep Sardar Nusrat still under some obligation to the British Government as he is one of the very few influential men here who has been con sistently friendly to our interests. Assuming therefore that it is not Government’s intention to take advantage of the financial straits to which Sardar Uusrat has been reduced in order to drive a hard, rockbottom, bargain I think Tomans 26,000 is a figure fair to both sides and I recommend that Government may be pleased to purchase the property at that price. At the present rate of Exchange the equivalent in Rupees is Rs.69,333-5-4 or Rupees 9,333-5-4 more than the Rupees 60,000 sanctioned by Government. I regret that I have not been able to keep within the figures given by ray predecessor but they were necessarily merely estimates, liable to modification in the light of a detailed and more accurate assessment. I may add that Sardar Uusrat has agreed to continue the supply of water for the garden free till the end of the present crop season and to maintain in perpetuity, an avenue of trees leading up to the Consulate entrance. These concessions, if estimated in hard cash, are worth Tomans 400. 6. The outstanding amount of the loan due from Sardar Nusrat is Tomans 14,000 so that if the sale price of 26,000 Tomans is approved Government will have to pay Tomans 12,000 or Rs.32,000/- After deducting rent due for the current year the total amount of interest outstanding on 30th July 1927 will be Tomans 800, (i.e., difference between interest and rent for two years from 31st July 1925 at 400 Tomans). I would however strongly recommend that Government be pleased to waive the recovery of this amount. It has frequently been stated ever since this Consulate wasx Will follow by next post. was first occupied in 1904 that the rent, which has remained unchanged throughout, is ridiculously low. There is no doubt that the normal rent at any time during the last ten, if not the last fifteen years would have been at least double what we have been paying. It was only by keeping the landlord continually under a financial- obligation to Government that it was possible to obtain such a low rental in the first instance and to avoid any subsequent increase, .biow that this financial obligation is to be liquidated I venture to submit that it would be proper to forego the outstanding interest in view of the exceptionally favourable terms of rent that Government « have been enjoying for so many years. x 7. I enclose a draft sale deed for the approval of the Government of India, 8, how that matters have reached this stage it appears to be desirable to conclude a final settlement as early as possible. I am therefore.forwarding a copy of this letter and enclosure to the Government of India in the hope that it may be possible for the hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to obtain the orders of Government by telegram. A copy of this letter with its enclosure is also being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, for information.

K 11980/11980/234. My dear Wakely, In your letter P.E882 of the 25th September, about the possible purchase of the consular building at Kerman from Sardar Hasrat, you suggest that the expenditure to be incurred be divisible equally between Imperial and Indian revenues. 2. Perhaps you will recollect your letter P.4683 of the 22nd December, 1923, about the cost of building a consulate at Kermanshah. Prom that paper we understood that India refused to bear a moiety of the cost incurred. 3. Does not the whole matter thus amount to a case of heads India Office win, tails Poreign Office lose? If I am wrong in this interpretation, I beg you to put me right. If I am correct, I fear that our Department most interested might well reply in the sense of your letter of 1923. But what I do want to avoid above all is that the incumbent of the post at Kerman should suffer while two offices here in London have a paper discussion. Will you then let me have your views quite frankly so that we can see what ma L.D. Y/akely Esq. ,C .B India Office.Prom 'Che Foreign Secretary to the Government of India To His Majesty’s Under Secretary of State for India India Office, LOUDON. Dated Simla, the August 1926. Proposed purchase of the Kerman Consulate. Sir I mi directed to address you on the subject of accommo dation for His Majesty's Consul at Kerman. 2* The building occupied by His Majesty's Consul.Kerman, was built by Adil-us-Sultana in 1905, who was granted advances upto Tomans 8,000 for the purpose. These advances were secured by a mortgage on the property. In 1923 the Political Resident, Eushire,reported that Tomans 2,000 of this debt still remained unpaid and the present owner of the building, Sardar Nusrat, 0.8.®.^ was in great distress. He therefore recommended a further loan of Tomans 14,000, which was granted by the Government of India at ? per cent interest repayable in four annual instal ments. The lease of these buildings was to expire in 1924 and by granting this loan the old lease was renewed for ten years on very favourable terms. In addition, it was considered that to help an old friend like Sardar Nusrat would have a good political effect locally. 3. Sardar Nusrat was unable to pay the first two instalments of the loan which were due on 30th July 1925; and the Government of India agreed in December last that he might repay the loan in the last three years of the ten years' lease of the Consulate but he should in the meantime pay interest on the loan at 7 perper cent# He has however now informed His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman that he cannot pay even the interest on the loan because he is extremely embarrassed partly owing to the bad harvest of last year. Copies of papers dealing with this matter have been sent to the India Office by weekly letters ) as noted in the margin. 4. It is reported that the ©No. 36-M, dated 3rd May 1923.

Sardar’s family are always living above their income which continues to diminish as they sell more and more lands. The Government of India agree with the views of the Political Resident, Bushire, that in order to safeguard our interests and to relieve Sardar Husrat from the obligations which he is unable to meet, the house and garden occupied by His Majesty's Consulate at Kerman should be purchased, and the Consulate placed on the same footing as those at Meshed, Birjand, Sistan, Bandar Abbas, Shiraz and Sabzabad, which are all owned by Government. 5. The value of the property was estimated to be Tomans 18,000 in 1923 but the landlord considers it would be valued by local experts at not less than Tomans 25,000 now. The Political Resident, Bushire, however, considers it likely that the sale can be arranged for about Tomans 20,000 (i.e.Rs 60,000 approximately) and is of opinion that the property is worth this amount. The amount of the loan to Sardar Husrat, out standing at the time, will be deducted from the purchase price and the balance only handed over to him. 6. The Government of India and His Majesty's Charge d* Affaires, Tehran^agree that the course recommended by Colonel Prideaux is the best in the circumstances and I am, therefore, to request the sanction of His Majesty’s Government to this lr expenditure which will, as usual, be divisible in moijties betweenAUu PlfT RWRV W1TW Telegram P* ^o. 60 -T, 81&gt;b 4^926 From - Foreign* Simla* 2515 To - Minister, Tehran.

' 4 ' /7U Repayment of loan granted to Sardar Nasrat. Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department memorandum No.770(2) -N., dated the 23rd December 1S25, and to report for the information of the Government of India that Sardar Nasrat’s son, 1 /Ierat-es-Saltaneh, has intimated to His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, that, though his father has managed,by paying the balance of interest due, to carry cut the arrangement with regard to the repayment of the loan and interest which the sardar himself had proposed and which the Government of Indie, were pleased to sanc tion on my recommendation, yet the Sardar is extremely embarrassed partly owing to the bad harvest of last year and that it will be quite Impossible for him to pay the interest due in July of this year. 2. Mr. Law adds that the Sardar 1 s family are always living above their income, and that this is constantly diminishing, as they sell more and more lends. It, therefore, seems necessary that steps should be taken in time to safeguard the interests of Government, while at the same time relieving the Sardar from obligations which he is unable to meet. Herat-e s-SaltanehHerat-es-Salteneh has himself suggested a remedy for the situation v/hich is that the Government of India should purchase the house and garden occupied oy His Majesty’s Consulate at Kerman. Seeing that the Sardar is in serious financial straits and has candidly declared his inability to pay even the interest on trie loan, I am of the opinion that the proposal of sale which has now been put forward by the son on his behalf is the best solution of the problem which otherwise can only result in loss to Government. For though the Government of India hold the property as security against the loan and could foreclose the mortgage in the case of failure to pay, to do so would result in the loss of Political prestige and have a most damaging moral effect on our interests. 3. The house and property were estimated to be worth Tomans 18,000 in 1923 (vide Colonel Trevor’s Express Letter No. 395, dated the 9th March 1923) but the land lord thinks they would be valued by local experts at not less than Tomans 25,000 now. As, however, it is unlikely that a purchaser can be found to pay this price at the present time, it is considered likely that, the sale could be arranged for about Tomans 20,000,(i.e.Bs.60,000 approximately), which the property is certainly worth. I, therefore, recommend that the Sardar’s offer of sale be accepted and that an offer for the acquisition of the property” at this price be made. 4. Allowing for depreciation and simple interest at 5fS on the depreciating value, the result of the invest ment will be that at the end of 20 years the Government of India will own the property free of charges (except those for annual and special repairs)and that it will have cost them Rs. 91,500, a sum less than what they would have had to pay in rents alone during the same period,had such rent beer calculated at the usual Persian rate of 10 % of the capital value.5. At present Government are paying Rs. 2,100/- per annum on account of rent, which is remarkably cheap considering that it is only of the value of the property, whereas 10 / is the usual rate at which rent is assessed by landlords in Persia. The Government of India might, therefore, have had to pay as much as 2 or 3 times the amount of the present rent and, but for the financial assistance given to the landlord which induced him to make a concession, they would have had to pay this rent if demanded, owing to the absence of any other suitable C&amp;utl accommodation where the Consulate arnrniu* be lodged. 6 . The other alternative method of getting over the Sardar’s inability to pay interest on the loan, is that the rent should be raised to equal the interest on the loan so that the Sardar would pay no interest and of the difficulty I am not inclined to advocate its adoption for the reason that Government will still be never be in a position to meet and will probably continue to hold in perpetuity. 7. If the Government of India agree to the purchase purchase price, and the balance only handed over to the Sardar. 8 . In the circumstances it seems best that the suggestioi of buying the house and property should be adopted, as it will prove cheaper in the long run and will incidentally put an end to all the disappointments and uncertainties to which anything like the present situation must inevitably give rise. Government would virtually be occupying the house free of rent. Though this might appear a less expensive solution of the Consulate, the amount of the loan to Sardar Nasrat outstanding at the time, will be deducted from the The9.

He is the leading landowner of this Province, a man greatly respected and still boasting a considerable political following.

Jtl'v.'/ qo , ‘•&lt;Ai Lease of Kerman Consulate. Your telegram 13th May 1905. Of the loan of 8,000 tomans granted to the owners of the Consulate 2,000 tomans still remain due. The Consul, Kerman has now telegraphed that Sardar Nusrat, the Landlord, is seriously emharrased hy immediate need of ready money, partly owing to failure of crops, and recommends grant to him of loan of 14,000 tomans (including balance of present debt) repayable at 1% interest in four annual instalments. The Consular buildings and timber on the land which would be security for this loan were valued at 14,000 tomans in 1905; but at present values which are considerably higher, 1 the owner valuing them at 30,000 tomans while Consul estimates them to be worth about 18,000 tomans; though it must be pointed out that as money is scarce now they might not find a ready purchaser if it were necessary to realize the « mortgage. Sardar Nusrat has been a loyal and steady friend of the British throughfcut recent years, end has suffered much in consequence especially from the late Governor General Sardar Assad; and the Consul represents that our prestige would be enhanced if it were found possible to give this support to an old friend. I agree that to help Sardar Nusrat over his difficulties would have a good poli tical effect locally. There is another reason, however, why he recommends the grant of this loan. Our lease of the present Consular Buildings expires next year; and the rental will then come up for reconsideration. The,present rental of 700 tomans (of which 120 tomans are spent on repairs) is exceedingly cheap for the accommodation of the Consul, Consular Office®, and ec rt; being less than 4% of the Presentpresent capital value; whereas 10^5 is the usual rate expected by landowners in Persia. The loan, if sanctioned, will enable us to renew the lease on the same very favour able terms. But if the Government o£ India are unable to sanction the loan, they must be prepared to pay about douole the present rental, thus incurring additional annual expenditure of about ps. 2100 /- the Persian Gulf No.. 466/770-M., dated the 23rd April 1923. ^our letter 395 March 9th last.
