O^r ) With reference to Foreign Office letter No.E 327/ 327/34 of the 18th March, I am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran regarding the continued employment of 'news-writers' at certain of His Majesty's Consular posts in Persia. 2. With reference to the opinion of His Majesty's Consul at Zahul, quoted in paragraph 3 of this despatch, that the news-writer at Zahul runs no risk at the hands of the Persian authorities | I am to recall the arrest last year of Mirza Darwish, the newswriter at Bam, and that of the Persian subject named Rashidi, (also referred to in paragraph 3 of Mr.Hoare's despatch) which was reported in Mr.Hoare's despatch No.82 (a copy of which was sent to the India Office in Foreign Office letter No.E 1361/610/34 of the 29th April.) 3. Since it would almost certainly be impossible for His Majesty's G-overnment to intervene effectively on behalf of the newswriter at Zabul, were action to be taken against him by the Persian authorities, while on the other hand it would be impossible for His Majesty's Government to divest themselves of responsibility for his fate, Sir John Simon cannot but consider The Under-Secretary of State India Office.consider it undesirable in principle that he should continue to he employed in that capacity; and he would suggest, for the consideration of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, that the views of the Government of India should he sought as to the desirability in the circumstances of terminating his employment. I am Sir Your obedient ServantsaakhT : British Legation t Tehran, 6 th April, 1933. Sir, On receipt of your despatch No. 76, I caused llirsa Hussein Quli Khan (Vafcil-ed-Dowleh) to he informed that he should cease to perform any duties for this Legation or the Vice-Consulate at Resht and that althoug^his salary would be discontinued on this account he would recelwe an Ts. 35. Ts. 35. annual compassionate gratuity. 2 » I venture, however, to urge that as a special exception, his gratuity might be raised to Tomans thirty five a month. Apart from the fact that he has served His Majesty's Legation faithfully for thirty five years, his salary was fixed at its present rate of thirty five Tomans a month when the toman was worth a great deal more than now. It has never been raised in recent years, as have the salaries of most other Government employees in Persia, and now that the rial has depreciated, its purchasing power has greatly decreased. In effect, therefore, the salary has been little more than a pension for some years and a further reduction will undoubtedly be a severe financial blow to /a*ii-ed-L&gt;owleh Equally, of course, the salary of thirty live Tomans costs His Majesty's Government much less today than when it was first fixed. As regards Kabul, Major Laly informs me that the *newswriter' never visits the Consulate in person, but delivers messages through a third person. Major Laly considers that he runs no risk, but I have no means of judging how far this is true, and the fate of Rashidi forms The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, O.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.- 2 - a discouraging precedent. 4# 1 a » siting further enquiries as to the exact status of the 'newswriter' at Ifeshed, whom Major Dal/ describes as r, recognised for many years as a Ifunshi'. negular employees of foreign Legations and Consulates are, so far as I know, perfectly safe. 6# The informant at Shiraz has, I am told, prowed himself extremely useful to Hie Majesty’s Consular officers, and those who hare served there recently are reluctant to recommend that he be told to drop all intercourse with the Consulate. I hare, however, given instructions that pending the appointment of a regular officer to Shiraz he shall discontinue his activities. 0n the arrival of a permanent Consul I will consider whether it is possible to appoint him as a 'Munshi' on the same terras as in the past, the only difference being that his position will be regularised vl8-&amp;~vis the local authorities. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R. H. Hoare.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 1361/610/34] Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 14.) (No. 82.) Sir, Tehran, February 25, 1933. I REPORTED at some length in my despatch No. 55a of the 11th February on the restrictions which are being placed with increasing stringency on the acceptance by Persians of foreign hospitality. Since then a certain Habibulla Rashidi, who for over twenty years has called at frequent intervals to give the oriental secretary of the day “ the talk of the town,” has been arrested. About three weeks previously Mr. Trott had asked him whether he would not be wise to keep away from the Legation for a short time, but he pooh-poohed the suggestion, saying that there was not the slightest danger and the police knew all about him. The chief of police, when questioned by Mr. Trott, made no pretence that there was any charge against him. and declared that he would be released at once if I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was in the employ of the Legation. He was himself in no way responsible as the arrest was ordered by the “ police de Surete,” which was not under his control. 2. I have told the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said that he had no knowledge of the affair, that he knew as well as I did that in the past a consider able Intelligence Service was run by this Legation, directed against Russian activities in the days of Persia’s weakness. He also knew perfectly well that, the times having changed, our organisation ceased to exist. If the man were a spy I should be debarred by common usage from interesting myself in his case, but spies did not come in by the front gate of a Legation in broad daylight. After some demur Feroughi promised to look into the case. 3. It seemed a good opportunity to reiterate my displeasure on the subject of the treatment to which the foreign Legations are being subjected, and I introduced my complaint by telling him that one of our consuls had just asked me whether it would be possible to transfer him. His reason was that the Persian friends he had made had recently been ordered to have nothing to do with him. Having little actual office work to occupy his time, he felt he was wasting it if he was debarred from getting to know something about the country in which he was posted by cultivating the society of its inhabitants. 4. Feroughi urged patience, saying it was a passing phase; he added, however, that in the past Persians who frequented the Legations, especially the British and Russian, were regarded by the patriotically minded rather as hirelings and despised accordingly : foreign diplomats had not always exercised due care in selecting their Persian friends. I replied that I might shortly find myself asking him for a list of “respectabilities” with whom I could, with safety to them and to my own reputation, enjoy social relations. Feroughi repeated that patience, and especially the settlement of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company controversy, would restore a normal situation. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have. &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. P.Z. '526 Z. 1933 —No. T' March 14, 1933. Section 5.

Consular Officers. —Captain A. C.. Galloway relieved Captain L. A. G. Pinhey as Vice Consul at Zahidan on the 21st January. New Years Day was cele brated as usual at Sistan Consulate and the subordinate Vice Consulates. 2. Sistan and Qainat. —The distributicn of land continues in Sistan. No land is given to those addicted to opium. As probably 75% of the local population is so addicted only the obviously hopeless cases are included in this category. Conscripts are being given land and can employ labourers to work it. Land is given for gardens either to men or women who apply and the Revenue Department is issuing seeds for Almonds and pistachio as an experiment. Sardars who formerly owned the land surrounding several villages are being given one small village each producing about 180 Kharvars of grain. After deducting the revenue amounting to 40 Kharvars there will remain 140 Kharvars which at present values represents an income of 700 Tomans per annum or 60 Tomans a month. This is, of course, a totally inadequate income for the Sardars to maintain even a very small establishment. Samsam Ud Dowleh is being given no land at all, it being asserted that “ he has other sources of income ”. Opium smokers are once more being dismissed from Government services. This procedure is adopted every few years, but they succeed in re-engaging themselves. Coins are being withdrawn from circulation by the Bank and notes issued. This has still further adversely affected trade, as the people are suspicious of notes and will not take them as ‘ change Meanwhile silver is being smuggled over the borders of Afghanistan to India where they can be disposed of at Rials 5/6 per Rupee as against the local' rate of Rials 7-50/8. Legally imported sugar is not obtainable in Sistan, but smuggled sugar can be had anywhere. The nominal bazaar rate for loaf sugar is Rials 14 per loaf while contraband sells at Krans 8/9. - i ENCLOSURE IN i •‘••vi/i FOdEiGN Sr° ~ T A pv, 8 The beggars of Zabul have been gathered in for the winter and are given a minimum of food and old clothing. Sardar Malik Mohamed Khan, Brother-in-Law of Shaukat U1 Mulk has at length been released from custody in Tehran and has reached Khwash from w T hence he is coming to Sistan, and has been allowed to retain his principal village Jhalabad. • 3. Persian Departments — Amnieh. —Sartip Azizullah Khan, Chief of the Gendarmerie inspected at Zabul from 28th/30th Jan uary. Justice. —The Chief of Gendarmerie reported urgently to Tehran that a separate court was required for Zabul. He has also suggested that as Amnieh are now required to serve summonses on persons living in the districts, a fee should be charged for service. Municipality. —The tov T n is no longer lighted by electricity, although the Powder House still functions for private consumers of current. The Municipality have not paid for lights for over a year. The Governor is reported as anxious to lease the Power House privately and to sell current to the Municipality, wLen, no doubt, arrears due wmuld be promptly paid. Military. —Naib Sarhang Mahmud Khan, of the Ministry of War proceeded to Khwash early in January to check the accounts wdth Sujan Singh, British Subject, w r ho is ov^ed a large sum by the Military Department. A curious rumour w r as current at Zahidan and Zabul to the effect that Amanullah Mirza, late Officer Commanding the Eastern Army, had been appointed Minister of Court in place of Teymourtache. Such an appointment was wffiolly unlikely and it is curious how it found currency. 4. Foreign Travellers. —Leone Arpea, Italian, proceeded to India on 7th January, en route Indo China. Koroly Zettner, Hungarian, who entered India without a visa and reached Karachi, was returned to the border by the Indian authorities and reached Zahidan on the •JMc98FD—18*—30*5-33—GIPS 2 2 ]2th. He proceeded to Tehran on the 14th alleging that he would obtain a visa from our Legation. 5. Miscellaneous. —Traffic between Meshad and Zahidan has suffered delay owing to damage to the road by spate. Tomans 20,000 have been allocated till the end of the present Persian Year for the construction of the new Zahidan-Zabul road and the earthwork is progressing. Stone is to be brought by lorry from Koh-i-Kwajah. It is stated that 300,000 Tomans will be voted for this road next year. It really appears that this road is to be tackled in earnest at last. When the full scheme of linking Zabul via Baring with Shusp is completed, Zabul will be within an easy days motoring of Birjand and two days of Meshad. India and Tehran only. 6. Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad .— The Kerman troops are still camped at Rodbar, Three hundred camel sowars sent from Khwash have not proceeded beyond Iranshehr. Abdul Hussain is reported to have looted another caravan. The majority of the. Baluchis of Sarbaz have joined him. The Kerman troops will probably return to Headquarters after the — 15th February, as the heat then becomes intense. If this be so, Abdul Hussain will remain at large and be a centre of unrest for at least another year. C. K. DALY, Major C.I.E., His Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain. Locust Report for the month of January 1933. No locusts appeared in the Consular District of Sistan and Kain (including Zahidan and the Sarhad) during the month of January 1933. C. K. DALY, Major His Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.&gt;!jM.l933 CONFIDENTIAL. His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate Sistan and Kain, Diary for the month of February, 1933. 1. His Majesty's Consular Officers .— Captain Taylor, assumed charge as Vice-Consul, Zabul, on February 4th. He was accompanied by Mrs. Taylor and family. Captain Beausang, I.M.S., proceeded on transfer to Quetta. 2. Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad .— Information regarding the operations against Abdul Hussain is obscure. Early in the month a report was current that troops from Rodbar and Iransheher made a night assault but were unsuccessful. The son and nephew of Abdul Hussain are reported as killed. Sardar Saidi and his brother Nawab of Kharram are reported to have quarrelled, as a result of which the former killed the latter. The Nawab is said to have favoured surrender to the Persians rather than to assist Abdul Hussain. Sardar Saidi has now definitely joined the insurgents. 3. ‘ Elections ’ in Baluchistan. —The G. O. C. sent for Idu Khan and Habibullah Khan and said one of them was to stand to be ‘ elected ’ for the Majlis. Both declined and eventually one Qiam, Shirazi, a person of obscure origin was duly ‘ elected ’ to represent Baluchistan. 4. Persian Officials. —Ruhi, one of the officials of the Ministry of Justice who was deputed last year to enquire into the Zahidan smuggling cases has arrived in Zahidan. His mission is kept secret, but it is believed that, as a result of reports to Tehran, he is endeavouring to collect evidence against the Governor, suspected of accepting bribes. An Inspector of the Monopoly Depart ment arrived at Zahidan at the beginning of the month and is engaged in checking ‘ prohibited ’ articles in possession of traders, which are to be confiscated and sold by the Government after Nauroz (20th March). The post of Civil Governor in Baluchistan, created last year, has been abolished and the ez-Governor is leaving for Tehran. A Health Officer has been appointed at Khwash and Giri Garibian, Armenian, has been sent there in that capacity. Afsher, Head of the Roads Dept, in East Persia visited Sistan for a week to inspect the new road construction. Agha Shora, Peace Court \Tudge of Zahidan and Zabul, returned to Zabul on the 14th February. The existence of only one court for Zahidan and Zabul still causes most severe hardship. Witnesses are dragged to and fro between the two places and cases linger on intermin ably. An Accounts Officer of the Customs Department visited Zabul for a week to inspect Customs Office accounts. Plerr Sohnorr, Manager of the Zabul Branch of the National Bank is to be transferred. His relief—a Persian—has arrived. 5. Sistan .—Malik Mahomed Khan, one of the leading Sardars, who had been called to Tehran and detained there, but was subsequently released, arrived in Zabul on 1st February. The distribution of the land hitherto farmed by Sardars is proceeding. A plan is on foot to start 2,000 gardens in Sistan. A number of plots have been distributed to cultivators for the purpose and the Revenue Department has brought a few gardeners from Yezd and elsewhere to instruct the peasants. Date palm seeds are being distributed free. Work has started on plots in the vicinity of the town. The village of Bun jar is to have a school and municipality. In an attempt to stop smuggling the National Bank issues no coin, as it was used to pay for goods smuggled from Afghanistan, whereas notes are not accepted by the smugglers. As the five Rial note is the smallest obtainable the poorer inhabitants are put to great difficulty, for shopkeepers have no change and will sell nothing for less than 5 Rials. Market produce, such as eggs, butter, etc., cannot be readily sold by villagers for the same reason. The ‘ Tax Sanitaire ’ of 9 Rials per traveller which had been imposed at Mirjawa has been abolished, doubtless as the result of representations made by our Legation, on behalf of motor drivers plying for hire on the route, who had to pay every time they passed Mirjawa.

Zahidan Smuggling Case of 1932 .— The results of some of the cases which were proceeding in Tehran have become known :— Narain Singh Akali .. One year’s imprisonment and a severe fine. Gulab Singh .. .. Six months. Abdul Faiz Khan late Per- Two years, sian Director of Customs. Harbans Singh .. .. Six months and fined 8,000 Rials. Rafashzadeh-Persian .. Fined 40,000 Rials. Pakzadeh, Customs .. 2 years. Official. Amin, Customs Official .. One year. Mirza Hadi, Customs One year and 1,000 Rials Officials fine. It is interesting to note, that, according to an article in the newspaper “ Koshish ” that nothing was proved against Arbab Mehdi, the leading Persian trader, who had smuggled on a large scale for years, as was well known. He is reported to have engaged a pleader for Ts. 30,000. Some of which money found its way to influential quarters. It was the fact that Mehdi smuggled, with connivance of the Customs Officials, and could undersell other traders, that practically compelled the latter to follow suit. 7. Foreign Travellers. — Aris H. Moure, Armenian, who had entered India without a passport and was put back over the frontier by the Baluchistan authorities was again put back over the border into Baluchistan by the Persians. His nationality is not established. His Majesty’s Consul has some grounds for suspecting him to be an individual whom he came across during the war, and has asked for photoes to be supplied by the Baluchistan authorities. Doctors of Medicine, Witold Winniaz and Jolef Wielawsili Poles, arrived from Kerman on 5th and proceeded to India. Lazar Fink,. Pole, Kailw T ay Engineer, employed in China, left for India on 7th en route Hong-Kong. 8. British Travellers. —Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. Noel, C.I.E., D.8.O., Political Depart ment, of Government of India arrived at Zahidan on 7th February and proceeded to Meshed en route United Kingdom on leave. Mr. H. Chalmers, an Official of the E. I. Bailway, arrived from India on 14th and proceeded, on foot, to the United Kingdom. His reason for traversing this inhospitable region on foot is not clear and cannot be a good one. Mr. Murray, Official of the North Western Bailway, Quetta, visited Zahidan from 14th to 19th February to inspect the railway pumping plant which has been operating to supply the Vice-Consulate with water. 9. Climatic. —Heavy rainfall at Zahidan and Zabul towards the end of the month, rendered the Zahidan-Zabul road impassable for motor traffic for several days. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty s Consul, Sistan and Kain.CONFIDENTIAL. r p. z. 7 His Majesty’s Consulate, Sistan and Kain, Diary for March 1933. ICi'X' I 1. Persian Baluchistan. —Abdul Hussain of Remishk continues to give trouble to the Military Authorities. He hides in the hills by day and cannot be located, making raids against isolated posts by night. His family have been sent to British territory. Sartip Abbas Khan proceeded to Iran- sheher on March 6th to arrange a concerted drive in the hills, in conjunction with Kerman troops. Should this fail, and up to now no reports of any decisive action have been received, it is improbable that further operations can be undertaken until next winter. Baluchis attacked an Amnieh post consisting of four men, near the British Mekran frontier. The gendarmes were severely beaten and their rifles stolen. The Baluchis escaped and cannot be traced. Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai visited the G» 0. C. at Kwash and endeavoured to obtain permission for his brother, Ahmad Khan, who emigrated to Afghanistan, to return to Persia. The matter has been referred to Tehran. The G. 0. C. has despatched Habibullah Khan Reki to British Mashkel to endeavour to induce Jahind Khan, Yarmuhammadzai to return to Persian territory. From a subsequent report it appears that the mission failed to achieve its object. It is reported that a Persian telegraph linesman was recently sent to Robat Levy post with instructions to destroy the boundary pillars in the vicinity of the post. He was prevented by the Levy Havildar in charge. 2. Judicial. —The Zahidan-Zabul Peace €ourt moved from Zahidan to Zabul during the month. The British Indian subjects who were recently sentenced in Tehran for smuggling have appealed and have been permitted to return to Zahidan, on bail, pending the hearing of their appeal. Orders have at last been received for the Peace Court to remain permanently at Zabul and for the establishment of a separate Court for Zahidan. 3. Persian Holidays. —H. I. M. The Shah’s Birthday was celebrated at Zahidan by a reception to which H. M. Vice-Consul and staff were invited. At Zabul a ceremony was performed by the troops. Foreign Consuls were not invited. The customary official calls were paid on local Governors at Zabul and Zahidan on the occasion of the New Year (Persian) 4. Communications. —Floods have occur red between Daulatabad and Sidiki on the Sistan-Zahidan road and the road is temporarily -impassable. Efforts are in ■-““A FOHt 6 [8 3 1! HiN. 1333 19 ’JM.1933 * i,i - - being made to realign the rOad iri' a manner which will avoid the floods. Should this prove impossible Tutins (Reed rafts) will have to be employed as was the case in 1929. The new road which is under construction is on an alignment which is not liable to inundation. 5. Government Trade Monopoly .—A large quantity of loaf sugar has been purchased by the Persian Government in Belgium. It is anticipated that 200 tons will reach Nokkundi in April and a further 400 tons in May. Indian traders who had been anticipating a revival of this trade in which they secured a handsome profit, in the past, as middlemen, are therefore once more disappointed. The sugar will be stocked in Zahidan and sold through specially appointed agents. This importation is partly due to the failure of the Russians to import sufficient sugar and partly as an effort to flood the markets in an endeavour to discourage smuggling. As however the Persian Government will doubtless endeavour to recover at least the full normal customs duty it is uncertain whether the latter object will be achieved. Still further restrictions on the freedom of trade are being resorted to in an endea vour to check the wholesale smuggling. All persons who bring goods into Zabul from the villages near the frontier are now required to produce.a ‘permit’ from the nearest frontier customs post and similarly no goods are allowed to be taken out to the villages without a permit from Zabul. At Birjand a special customs checking post has been established and the contents of all lorries proceeding up-country are examined and Customs ‘ Passeavant * certificates called for. In spite of these pre cautions the villages all along the frontier from the sea-coast to Meshed are fully stocked with smuggled tea, sugar and cloth and consequently legitimate trade in the towns is at a standstill. 6. Revenue Department .—This Depart ment has now discovered what was com monly known a year agr—that Baigan the late Reis-i-Malieh had taken a huge amount in bribes. It is probable that official cognisance of this would not have been taken, but for the fact that it is now certain that he also embezzled government funds. The two clerks (brothers) wdio were in charge of the accounts are being prosecuted. The Department has notified the public that all amounts illegally collected by Baigan will be recovered from him and remitted from Revenue due. As a result practically every cultivator i n Sistan district has submitted a claim.2 7. In preparation for the re-distribution of land in Sistan, the cultivation of opium was prohibited last autumn. A certain amount was however cultivated in gardens which did not fall within the scheme. This has now been destroyed by order of the Revenue Department and for the time being no poppies are being cultivated. Two Government experimental gardens are now being prepared—one at Imamieh, near Bunjar village and the other at Deh Dost Muhammad. The latter village is to have a telegraph office and a school in the near future. 8. Control of Opium Addicts. —At a conservative estimate 80 per cent, of the population of Sistan is addicted to the opium habit. The recent redistribution of lands has, however, drawn the attention of the authorities to the large number of men who are totally unfit to work. This has led to the restriction of cultivation of poppies as mentioned above. The Excise Department sells opium at Zabul at Tomans 34 per seer (l/3rd of a lb.). Smuggled opium, brought from Afghanistan is available at Is. 24 per seer. During the month some two thousand opium smokers were collected by the Gendarmerie. It was proposed to deport them to Khorassan, but instructions were received that they were not to be sent elsewhere. On the occasion of the Id, they were permitted to return to their homes, but were warned that they would again be collected. No further action has as yet been taken. It is reported that a plan is under preparation for the formation of a £ Colony’ in the neighbourhood of Qileh Rustum—a derilict fort in a desolate stretch of the Zabul-Zahidan road. Wells are to be dug and mud huts erected. The inmates will be under the supervision of a medical officer and will be required to work, in return for their food, on the con struction of the new road. The temporary release of these destitute and besotten creatures is probably intended to afford them an opportunity to escape across the border into Afghanistan from the fate in store for them. 9. Persian Officials—Z&amp;mul Abidin Muntazami—Persian has relieved Herr Schnorr as Manager of the local branch of the National Bank at Zahidan. He opened business somewhat inauspiciously by virtually defrauding a Consulate clerk of ten tomans, when he was cashing a cheque. Two vaccinators have arrived in Sistan and are vaccinating the inhabitants of the villages. . . Sarhanc: Mukri, Frontier Commissary, has been ill for some months. He has been cured by our Medical Officer. There are indications both at Zabul and Zahidan of an attempt of the higher MC90F.D—18—29-5-33—GIPS officials to be more friendly. The approach has been so forced and simultaneous and the professions of affection for the British and dislike of the Russians so fervid, that one is led to the conclusion that a hint must have been received from higher quarters to adopt a conciliatory attitude. It will be interesting to note whether any such change of attitude has been detected elsewhere in Persia. 10. Municipality. —The Zabul Munici pality initiated a tax of two Krans per package entering the town by lorry, camel or donkey transport. This was indeed the last straw, and villagers practically ceased to bring in even perishable supplies. The tax produced insufficient to pay the wages of the tax-collectorate and has been abandoned. The Revenue Department has received a credit of Tomans 1,000 for the construc tion of masonry water-channels in the town. On all sides there are definite indications that the Shah’s determination to develop Sistan is to be given effect to, when and as, funds become available. 11. British Travellers. —Lieutenants Clive and Coates, on leave, arrived at Zahidan on 15th March and visited Zabul from 16th—24th, leaving on the latter date for Meshed. Foreign Travellers. —Master Boris Frank, Pole and Master Aranoff, Russian, both from Meshed, proceeded to Nanital on 9th for study. 12. Afghan Affairs. —In spite of recent articles in the Press designed to encourage a ‘ rapprochement ’ between the Afghan and Persians, relations do not seem to be improving. Both at Zahidan and Zabul tlie Police have declined to renew the Residency Permits of Afghan subjects and have warned - them to leave the country, and threatened forcible deportation in the event of the order being disobeyed. Afghans ^at Zahidan have refused to comply with these verbal instructions and have demanded that the order to quit Persia be given them in writing. To this the police have demurred. Reports from Meshed indicate that the Persians are deliberately delaying the issue of Permits to Afghans and are raising difficulties over the recognition, as Afghan subjects of Berberis, hitherto so recognised. As this baiting of the Afghans seems to be applied universally in East Persia it may be assumed that it is part of a settled policy dictated by Tehran. C. K.

The man was actually interrogated by the Police last year in connexion with his reports. In any case the newswriter is precluded by his instructions from supplying information of much importance.

Lear Lavis, The recent arrest and death in prisotf at Kerman of a former Munshi of the British Vice-Consulate at Bam and of recent years Consular Newswriter from there to the Consulate at Kerman, has led to an examination of the whole system of Newswriters in Persia. The man at Astarahad is practically the only real Newswriter left. please state exactly what your impression is of the present position of the Astarabad Newswriter vis-a-vis the Persian authorities. He still appears to act as the 'Agent' of the British Government in a number of ways. Are you satis fied that this is safe, or do you think that he should be told to restrict his reports to news that is common knowledge and to avoid all other 'Consular' duties ? You have, I believe, toured in that district and may know whether the local authorities are aware of his reports to you and if they object to them. His trouble over water last years does not seem to have had anything to do with his 'Consular' status, in his petitions to the Persian Cabinet he described himself as ' former agent to the British Government'.

I do not recollect exactly when he ceased to 5e official consular agent. As regards his reports the local authorities must know that he receives salary from and sends reports to us. There is no secrecy about the business. Regarding material of his (? reports - omitted) this is either news that is common knowledge or news that can be readhly obtained by any person taking the trouble to enquire. He has no special sources of information and above all uses no espionage methods. His trouble over water last year was, I believe, a purely private affair arising from his position as landed proprietor and having nothing to do with his 'consular' status. I do not think he acts as 'Agent' of the British Government or performs 'consular' duties unless perhaps in occasionally acting as channel of communication for illiterate Kurramis requesting issue or renewal of temporary certificates of British nationality. Most of these Kurramis must now be Persian subjects under the Nationality Law. He might be warned never under any circumstances to do anything for British subjects or Kurramis beyond reporting to Tehran or Resht. _ . , Yours sincerely, (Signed) A.W.DAVIS.

The argument that the Persian police must be aware of the activities of the other newswriters may perhaps have a certain weight, but may it not also be assumed that the police must for years have been aware of the activities of Mlrsa Darwesh? The main factor in the situation seems to be that we should be powerless to help these people if they did ever happen to be punished or condemned to death by the Persian aithorities on account of their services to us.

Sir, With referenee to ny Secret Deepsteh No. 347 of August 10th on the subject of the enploynent of consular nevs-writers in Persia, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, s copy of a letter that 1 have received from Mr. Richardson, until recently the aeting British Consul at Kerman, giving further details regarding the arrest of feirsa Darwish df Baa. I aa satisfied from what Mr. Richardson says that the cause of Mirsa Darwish’a arrest was his report, of which I enclose a copy, dealing with the operations against Mir Barkat. Harmless though this report may sound, there is quite enough in it to arouse the suspicions of the Persian military authorities* 2. Whilst waiting for this report I had not relaxed ay efforts to ascertain whether there was any truth in the report that order for Mlrza Darwish’s execution were sent from Tehran, and General Ayrom, the Chief of Police, had undertaken to obtain particulars from Kerman. These have now reached him, but he can still offer no explanation as to why Kirsa Darwish was arrested. The report merely shows that the arrest took place at the instance of the Governor General of Kerman of the tlae, who sent word that Mirsa Darwish was a suspicious character and should be interrogated* He was consequently brought to Kerman, but died a natural death before the investigation had proceeded very far, or revealed anything against him. According to General Ayrom, the only way to find out the real reasons for the Governor-General’s suspicions The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.8.I*, etc., etc., etc., THE FOREIGN OFFICE- 2 . suspicions was to consult his private archives* It would he /N; no use seeking information froa the present occupant of the post as provincial Covernors-Genoral and Governors regarded their archives as their private property and took then away with them when they left# So far as orders for his execution are concerned General Ayron asserts positively that none were sent from Tehran# 3# Although this explanation la not entirely satisfactory I must confess that it has always seemed to ne somewhat improb able that definite orders were sent for ttlrza Darwlsh's execution though it la Just possible that they were sent by the General staff# 4# I had also while waiting for Mr. Richardson’s report learned from Agha Hussein ^uli Khan, the Consular news-writer at Astarabad that he had become uneasy as the result of enquiries by the local police into his connexion with the Legation or Vice-Consulate at Resht. He even for a time stopped sending his msual reports# The occasion of these enquiries was undoubtedly the difficulties that certain Kurramls resident in the neighbourhood were then experiencing in respect of their position under the * eraian Nationality and Foreigners' Regist ration laws and I accordingly wrote to the Acting Minister for -—Foreign Affairs the private letter of which I enclose a copy, axplaining that Hussein ^uli Khan fulfilled no Consular duties whatever and asking that this might be explained to the local authorities# Although I never received any reply to this letter, Huaaein .ull Khan has made no further complaints and has resumed his reports, from which I assume that my letter had/ 5# Although I do not consider that a ease like that of Mirxa Darwlsh la likely to recur, 1 cannot ignore the argument put-3. put forward in a private letter from your Department that however innocuous the reports supplied hy such agents may he* and however well-known to the Persian Government* we should have no effective means of protecting tnem in an emergency and that in consequence we cannot diveat ourselves of a measure of responsibility for them* just because in a reasonable and civilised country they would be in no danger* It so happens moreover that although Astarabad is a centre where political information of some importance may be collected* particularly about Turcoman tribal politics and Perso-Soviet frontier questions* Hussein Quli Khan is clearly precluded by hia instructions from supplying such information or commenting upon it intelligently* The kind of information that it is left to him to supply is of no great importance* certainly not of sufficient importance to warrant our asking him to run the risk of involving himself in difficult ies with the local authorities* 6* This being so* I suggest that I should inform Hussein Quli Khan that he will not be required in future to submit any reports or to take any steps whatsoever in connexion with the affairs of British subjects or protected persons resident in his district* I should not propose to say anything further to the Persian authorities. I am* however, particularly anxious that his present remuneration of thirty five tomans a month should be continued to him as a pension for the remainder of his life* In view of the services that he and his family have rendered to His Majesty 1 s Government in the past I do not consider that we should be justified in doing less* especially as he is now an old man* 7* The discontinuance of his present duties by Hussein *uli Khan will involve the disappearance of the only remaining Consular News-writer, properly so called* employed in Persia* There will* however* still be persons whose duties approximate in some degree to those of a news-writer* 8. The8. The noBt obvious case is that of the property agent at Hamadan* Conditions in Hamadan are however very different from those prevailing in remoter parts of the inspire, where the officials are under less direet supervision and at the same time less accustomed to foreigners and consequently to anything savouring of connexion with foreigners among their own people* Moreover, the fact that we own a property at Hamadan renders it natural that we should employ an agent to look after that properl Finally the Persian Government regard the Vice-Consulate as bein£ only temporarily unfilled and are unlikely to make more difficult over the fact that we employ our former Munshi than they do over the employment of the J^unshl of the Vice-Consulate at Resht whil« that post is temporarily closed. Taking all these considerations into account I think it improbable that difficulties will arise at Hamadan, but if X am mistaken they will almost certainly take the form of complaints to the Legation and not of direct action against the property agent* 9* Some of these considerations apply to the purveyors of information employed at Tehran* and* I expect* to those employed at Meshed* Shiras and Bistan. These men are in direct touch with the Legation or Consulate concerned and so far as Tehran is concerned* I am sure nothing very serious could happen to Rashidl jor to the man employed by the Commercial Secretary without the Legation being able to bring the matter unofficially to the notic of some responsible authority* In any case* the position of these men is totally different from that of either Mlrza Darwish or Hussein Quli Khan. The latter are men who had all their lives been exclusively identified with British servios and who had* on the tenaination of their official services* continued to perform6 perform certain semi-official duties as s matter of lyalty and old association. They may or may not have had doubts as to their position, hut if they had they would probably feel it their duty to continue none the less, relying in all simplicity on the protection of a distant Legation or Consulate in case of need. Rashidi on the other hand is a man of intelligence and experience, closely connected with Persian officials of fall kinds: he must be in a much better position than the | Legation to juoge whether he is running any risk or not by )following his present profession and can have no illusions as 1 to the power of the Legation to help him. He comes psrfectly openly and visits equally openly the Sheikh of Mohammerah and other Persian subjects whom it might be supposed slightly dangerous to visit. I have no doubt whatever that his activittes I are countenanced by the police end that so long as he is willing to be employed we need have no moral sci»uples about employing him. This is also true of the man who supplies the Commercial Secretary with bazaar information. Strictly speaking we do not 'employ” Rashidi at all: he receives a travelling allowance while the Legation is at Gulhek and a present at | the Hew Year, but no regular wage. He probably extracts what \ he can from the Sheikh of Mohammerah, for the sum he receives from the Legation is ludicrously small. 10* I do not possess sufficient information to be able to make any recommendation with regard to the informants at Meshed and Sistan, but I am consulting Major Daly, and shall submit a further report in due course. As regards Shiraz, I « , it am inclined to think that unless the nan in question is a British subjedt, his services should be dispensed with as possible. This may, in any case, be inevitable shortly forfor financial reasons. On ms point also I shall subnit a further report* 11# I am sanding copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the OoTernaent of India (Ho.865)# I have the honour to be with the highest respect t Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R.H.HOAKE.(OOPY OK .

Personal* September 16th 1962 My dear G4rant t You may be aware that for many years a certain Huaaein Quli Agha, also called V skilled—Do wish# acted as Britltiii Consular Agent at Astarabad* In 1927 the Imperial Government brought in a law forbidding Persian subjects to act as Consular Agents for foreign countries and Hussein Quli was in consequ# ce informed that he no longer entfoyed any official position as a consular employee of the British Government. In view* however* of the faet that he had served the British Government in this capacity for many years he continued to receive a small monthly salary of thirty tomans* which was in effect a pension, although in return he was asked to provide from time to time brief reports on commercial matters* for instance* the prices prevailing in the bazaar* and other items of general news. I have recently heard from Hussein Quli that he has been summoned by the Chief of Police at Astarabad and asked to explain the nature of his reports to the British Vice-Consul ate at rtesht. The enquiry was probably made as the result of the difficulties that have recently arisen regarding the registration of the numerous Kurramis who reside in the Astarabad district. Hussein Quli explained that he had no official position and fullilled no consular duties of any kind and had told the Kurramis to communicate direct with the Legation or the British v'ice-Consulate at Reaht. I may add that no attempt has ever been made to conceal the faet that the reports mentioned above were sent and the local authorities must always have been aware of the practice.

Dear Mr. Hoare, Your Oecret Despatch No. 485-14 of the 9th July last that was sent by hand from Isfahan only reached me at the end of September. I was still in bed at time it arrived and had to delay in replying to it till mq return here. Nevertheless I did not fail to make the necessary enquiries before I left Kerman in regard to the circumstances attending t e arrest of our unfortun ate News writer, Mirxa Darwish. 2. I am still convinced that the latter’s arrest and his condej-nation were due to his news writing activities. There is now positive evidence to show that the last letter wHtten by him and aauressed to the Indian Assistant was intercepted at KERMAN after it had been censored. The local Post Office on finding that it contained information regarding the movements of Persian troops reported the matter to the Rais- 1-Nasmieh, who telegraphed to BAM ordering the police there to search Mirza Darwish’s premises. with this Consulate was seized, and he himself was arrested md despatched under escort to Kerman. He was detained in prison till his death on or about the 8th March. enee. The former was addressed to my Indian Assistant, axid as last year. I admit that the tone of M.D.'s other effusions could hardly give rise to genuine offence to the Persians. Besides As the result of the search, his previous correspondence 3. X might mention that the Post Office at Kerman, when our agent’s letter was intercepted only censored private correspond- such, considered as a private communication. 4. I enclose a specimen of a report received at the end of containing Reginald H.Hoare Esquire C.M.Q., His Majesty’s Minister, TEHRAN.containing scraps of information in respect of the operation of the Conscription Law in the BAM district - the/ referred to such trifles as the receipt of Russian sugar there and the inconrenienee suffered by the public owing to the Post Office being situated outside the town* However harmless and inoffens ive such reports may appear to be, the local authorities in the provinces, especially the Military, are inclined to attach undue Importance to the fact of a Persian subject being in communication or having eny relations whatever with a foreign Consulate* Yours sincerely.■ 331 (COPY OP 3N0LldH TRAK8LATI0K. ) * &gt; l ■ * V' ~ M&lt;T. 5w.

I believe that the employment of Consular Kewswriters has given rise to difficulty in the past, notably in Afghanistan, and it is possible that a number of precedents regarding the I am, however, unacquainted with these precedent a and my views are therefore entirely personal and tentative. 8. The question of the legitimacy of the employment of Wewswrlters and similar agents appears to me to turn entirely upon the nature of the information supplied. There is no law, even in Persia, forbidding Persian subjects to make known to foreigners, whether official or unofficial, facts that are not in themselvea of a confidential character. So long as a Persian subject file Excellency The Right Honourable The Karl of Vllllngden, 9.M.8.I., etc*, etc., etc., Foreign Department, Simla.-S3. subject confinea hlmaalf to aopplyln^ information of a general kind, such as ohangoa in offiolal appointments, the progress of public utility sehaaes like electric light or town-planning or the substance of new regulations issued by the authorities, or of a eoia&amp;erclal kind, such ns the prices of ooaaoaities In the B&amp;sa&amp;r or the prospects of the crops, X uo not see how the rersian Government can properly object, whether the man receives payment for his information or not, *ny uore than they can properly object to the employment of a Persian subject aa a Munahi or clerk in a Consulate. But if ha supplied in* om&amp;tlon that cun by any stretch of imagination ba regarded as conflcential, such as information regarding forthcoming events that are not yet public knowledge, and above all if he supplies military information, however innoc uous, then the Persian Government &amp;ay well raise objections. They would do so with even more force if the Sewswriter were to include criticism of the administretion in his reports or to record Instances of disaffection among the people. 4. If the Persian Government were to aam that the employment of a purveyor of newa of the first type should cease, it would be difficult to refuse in any particular case, but if they were without warning to punish the man in question, there would I consider be good grounds for a protest, not on formal grounds but on the ground that such action was inconsistent with friendly relations. If they were to puniah a man of the second type I do not see that any steps could be taken on hie behalf. This applies especially to any man employed on becret Service work (which ia not necaaaarily the same thing as a nan paid from Secret Service funds) but X assume that there are no such persona employed by any Consular officer in Persia. §• I find it hard to believe that the Parslan authorities era unaware of the activities of any of the persona mentioned in the enclosure*anclosure to despatch. x’ho^ au«t certaiiil/ i€JM&gt;v all about tha visits that 3 ashiai pays to ihe Oriental Secretary^ but he has paid these visits lor years without any objection frost the x er slf«n . ovey who may even pay hia small suae th^aa&lt; Ives for retailing the current questions in which the Legation is taking aa interest* I f noy that it would t&gt;« iourid that Uiey are equally aware of the visits of the i*en similarly employed at Meshed, Slstan and Shlras* 6* The C onsular Kewswriter at / starahad, Agha 1 uasein -oili Khan (Vakil-ed-Dowleh) was employe cl for thirty years as Consular Agent, his grandfather and father having held the appointment before him for a period going back for ninety years* He acted aa Consular Agent until 1927 9 when the Persian aovernment made a law that leraian subjects might not hold consular appolntnemts under foreign governments* Since then he has been paid a monthij fee of thirty five tomans for reports on the affairs of the Astarabad district (see Foreign Office despatch ho* &amp;27 of December fcnd 1927 : K lb64i/1296V234)* It cannot be said that he is now in any way officially recognised fey the Persian author ities, but he occasionally intervenes with the authorities on behalf of British Protected Persons, Astarabad being a great centre for Kurraai emigrants* The local minorities do not sees to mind but unless further enquiries into Hussein Uuli Than'* relations with the local authorities show that such a course ia unnecessary^ X propose to instruct file Majesty's Vice-Consul, when the Keaht Vice-Consulate re-opens, that the former Agent must not in future fee employed on any work, such as the conveyanc of instructions to British Subjects or i rotacted Persons, which could fey any means fee Interpreted aa the performance of 'Consulax duties, and must fee warned not tc perform such duties on his own initiative: and must also confine his information to the harmless subjectsauDJ*ct» I have Indiaated above. 7. 1 nay add that during the tenporarjr closure of tha Reaht Vice-Consalate, I have had occasion to warn tha Jtunshi in charge that he must confine hla reports to innocuous subjects I these reports were apt to contain items, such as reflexions on the Shah's honesty, whish if interoeptsd could at the worst have led to a Consular Offleer's transfer from Persia, but which might have cost a Persian subordinate hie freedom end even hla life. 6. The arrest of Klrsa Darwesh of Ban is still a mystery. The Acting-Consul at Keman informed me of hie arrest by telegram at the time and X at once made such enquiries as X could. X have einee pressed these enquiries without however aeeertslning more that that the late Qovernor-Oenaral had made an adverse report upon him. The Chief of Polios, who denies smphatleally that ordsrs were Issue* from Tehran for his sxeeutlon has called for a full report and X am still hopeful of obtaining further light on hla ease. 9. X note that the Anting Consul at Kerman has no doubt but that Mlrsa Darwesh'a arrest was due to his news-letters. X am ashing Mr. Richardson whether there are any special reason© for supposing that this was the case, beyond the general reason that there appears to be no other reasonable explanation. X as also asking for specimens of the reports that he has sent to the Consul ate in recent sontha. ID. In spite of the frtte of Jilrsa Darveah of Ham, X see mo reason why Persian subjects should not be employed by Consular Officers to eolleet Information of an innocent kina, provided that on the one hand no attempt is made to conceal their employment from the Persian minorities sna that on the ether the sen so employed should not be commonly called, and above all should not sail them selves, by any title implying that they hold an off lei al position. X agree however that such appointments should not be made unless there are speelsl reasons that render this necessary. X propose that5. that tha mh at Aat^rsbaa ano il ter c; lo ea to conti nua the restricted duties 1 hmre already indteateo, eo long he lives, unless His Majesty's (loveiruaent, to whon X an sen ing a copy of this despatch, particularly wish that these should be cl©continued. Th« only other sppolntnent will be the one X an proposin&amp;to His Majesty's Oovennn&lt;mt should be nede st Hanadan, where special conditions prevail* 11. I see sons difficulty in securing official recognition for sucn nppointaents as are made or maintained, do long as a 1 ersian subject sup: lies s foreign Consulate with tit-bits of harm less information the Persian Government can afford to take no notice, but if they are sskea to give this am official recognition# including s title in which the word ^Consular* appears# they night not unreasonably object that it would be as easy to recognise him as a Conaular Agent or honorary Vice-Consul right away# which would be contrary to their law. 12. My recc«iaenviailon for iosadan is that th&lt; former Hunshl of the Vice-Consulate at Haaadan should be paid s small retaining fee for the performance of duties analogous to those of s news- i writer but with the title of 8 roperty Agent* 1 . My intension is that he should restrict his reports to Basaar information and to the communication of the texts of any regulations of interest issued by the local authorities. In addition he will have the general care of the Consular property# except in the unlikely event of this being sold outright# and of the military cemetery. The performance of other duties must be decided upon from time to time. At present# for inetmce# he is assisting His Majesty's Consul at Kerjaanshah in connexion with the forthcoming defence in the Court of Appeal at Bamadan of a case brou&amp;ht against Mr. hoy land by a certain euben l*alesar# who was fined by the British forces of occupation c^rin.-. -.he vn*. am confiatsnt taut ecAivites sued m tnese wi . i landp land him In no trouble so lon^ at he refrains fro« auggeating that he ha* an official position. 1^# I enclose for Yours xcellency’s iiuornation a copy of s circular despatch sent to Consular Officer# by iir Robert Clive in 1927, when the law against the esploynent of Persian subject* aa Consular agents for foreign countries was introduced. 14.

With reference to your telegram Ko.30 T, dated the 6th instant to His Majesty’s Minister at TEHRAN which was repeated to me under your No. 1123 of the same date, I have the honour to furnish the following particulars regarding the late Consulate n ews-writer,MIRZA DARWESH. 2. The latter mentioned individual, who was formerly a clerk in the Vice-Consulate at BAM and granted a small monthly allowance on its abolition in 1907, was employed later as a news-writer and was still working in that ca.acity when I assumed charge of this post at the end of April last year. I have found his letters neither interesting nor of any great use and it was my intention to have recommended on the visit on deputation of His Majesty’s Consul-General,MESHED that ' his services might well be dispensed with, ’inter alia* on political grounds. It might be mentioned that whilst on tour in my coastal district I issued instructions that reports from the news writer in question need not be transmitted to me but were to be addressed to and retained at KERMAN. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S \ 3. I.nttor No 8 4^ M. r^rj 16 ,HIM.1932 [4 JUL\ 3 T c£3&gt; • On the 28th Januar^jf fthte Indian Attache telegraphed Ocr/v 3 reporting the arrest!of the news-writer referred to above, l 19c i after his house had been searched by the police at 3AI1* It was inferred that one of his weekly letters which had failed to reach the Consulate had been intercepted in the post# 4. Shortly after my return to head-quarters, I learnt that the afore-said kIRZA D4RWESH, who had since been removed to KSRkAN and detained in prison, had died on the 9th or 10th March* It has now been ascertained from the prison doctor through private sources that the cause of his death was dysentery and that it had been accelerated by the lack of opium to which drug the deceased was strongly addicted. 5* From accounts received, there was no reason whatever to suspect foul play, as after the receipt of orders for his execution, it would appear that the. military authorities were anxious that the wretched man should be kept alive till this was carried out, and conveyed their wishes to the medical officer concerned. 6. In conclusion, I beg to state that the cause of the late MIRZA DARWESH* arrest and detention was undoubtedly due to his news-writing activities, but I entertain no suspicions in respect of his death, while in custody. I would also add that there axe no similar news-writers in the service of this Consulate. Copies of this despatch are being furnished to His Majesty* s Minister at TEHRAN and to the Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
