Sir, May I venture to submit that in reference to the present position in Persia and the efforts of its Government towards effecting internal re-organisation and reform, there may be a possibility of an appointment of a non-Persian Adviser in certain Government Departments such as the Customs or the Inland Revenue. Since my appointment with the Government of Bahrain is now completed, and I shall very soon be departing on leave, may I remark that my services in such a capacity are available; and I believe myself to be capable of good service (especially in the Customs Department) for a short term of years. I have lived and worked in Bushire, as well as in Iraq, and Bahrain, and I have a sympathetic understanding of the Persian temperament, and can work efficiently with Persian gentlemen. If this suggestion meets with your approval, I should be glad to submit particulars of my experience and abilities.

Gavin of the Royal Engineers, who is at present training recruits and with who I spent a climbing holiday in the Alps this summer, expressed a great desire for similar service. For this he has ver. special qualifications. He was wireless officer of the 1935 x-iount Everest Expedition and there is nothing that he does not know about field wireless work on all waves as well as being expert at Morse. In particular he has made a special study of wireless conditions in the Himalayas which are very tricky and his experience on Everest in this connection was invaluable because such conditions need understanding and an ordinary wireless exp rt might have much difficulty in working his set. Furthermore Gavin knows all about the transport of apparatus over mountain us country which is a so vitally impostant and the specially light and portable types of apparatus suitable for the job. It may be therefore that if there is any question of maintaining contact with India he would be far more valuable for s. ch work than merely training recruits as he is nor doing.

My deer Baggallay, I sent you at the beginning of this eventful year a little diary, and enclosed a few lines offering you my heartiest good wishes for all the very best in 1939. I hope these fetched up safely. I think I mentioned that T contemplated coming home in March when T would make it a point of calling and paying my respects. Unfortunately, I had to change my plans, with the result that I am still in India. I daresay you know that when I gave up my post at Kerman I came to India with the intention of obtaining some employment, which so far, I am sorry to say, I have not succeeded in doing. I attained the age for compulsory retirement (55 years) in November last, and since then have been wandering about different parts of India honing that something would turn up. I have now come to the conclusion that India is hopeless and that there is nothing doing, and nothing to be gained by remaining in this country. I am taking the liberty of writing to ask whether you can very kindly do anything for me in the way of helping me to get some sort of employment in London, or nerhaps in one of the Colonies. The inactivity of retirement is extremely boring and depressing and I feel J90 ianything which would give me a few Cs. a weet tolge^i small pension would be very acceptable, and of course, I would go full out to make a success of any work entrusted I know these are hard and difficult times, but it has occurred to me that in view of the present International situation there might possibly be some sort of employment going in some department under the foreign Office, and, if so, that you with your great influence could help me, and for which T would be most grateful, 1)0 you think if I came home and saw you that you could put me on to something? I have been thinking about Cyprus, but openings might not be found on the spot, so perhaps it would be wiser to come home and try through the Secretary of State for the Colonies. T have often thought of writing to Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugesson who is now our Ambassador in Ankara, T believe, but haven’t done so as T am not sure whether he would consider it 1. audacious and 2. whether he could give me any work. °lease do forgive me for troubling you especially as you must be terribly busy and hard worked these days, but a word of advice and any kind help would, T can assure you, be most gratefully accepted. T hope that you are very fit and well. to me With very kind regards Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) C. H. LINCOLN.COPY (X 9723/132/505) The writer of this letter was for over twenty years Vice- Consul at Khorramshahr (then Mohammerah), and was subsequently Consul at Kerman. He was never, I think, a regular member of the Indian Foreign and Political Department, but started as a member of the Indian Medical Department (not the Indian Medical Service ). He is a very decent fellow and was a capable Consular Officer. I rather fancy that he must have a touch of Anglo- Indian blood, but he has one, and I rather fancy two, sons serving as Officers in the British Army after having gone through Sandhurst. It is obviously very difficult to find employment for a man of this kind, who is now fifty-five years old. Nor am I sure exactly what he could do. He must long ago have lost all his medical knowledge, but could no doubt do administrative work of one kind or another. His knowledge of Persian is very good and he probably knows Hindustani or some Indian language well also. This letter was written three months ago (I have not had time to tackle it till now) and it is possible that the war may make it easier for him to find employment of some sort in India. Anyhow I should be grateful if those concerned would note his name. Meanwhile I have written to him saying that I will certainly enquire whether there is anything that he could do if he were to come to London, but that I can hold out no great hopes and would not advise him to come on the off-chance. I have added that I am sure that Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen would not mind his writing in the least, but that, being in Turkey, it is unlikely that he could do anything on his behalf.

Please excuse r; e from writing at such a time when you must be exceedingly busy. I do so because I am very nxiouas to undertake some work in which any special qualifications I may possess would be of the most use. In view of the possibility of trouble with Russia it maybe t at the Government of India are concerned with the position in Turkistam and Tibet, If so they may wish to have agents, political and otherwise, in that part of the V/ordd. IhUould also be essential to maintain if possible the status quo in Tibet. I feel that my special knowledge of travel in Tibet and the Himalayas and the peoples might make me useful. I have now been three times into Tibet and I am used to handling Sherpas,Tibetans and Gurkhas. I believe too that I am limed Dy these people. I am confident that it would be possible also to fire the enhusiasm of the Sherpas who are the toughest and best of native tribes and if it came to an emergency have men ready-a large numuer- who m ght prove invaluable on the Himalayan frontier. I am prepared to take an intensive course in the appropriate language,Nepali or Tibetan and as regards the latter language have a friend in England who I believe speaks it flue itly and might join in on the same work. This is all very tentative but I do feel that I have some qualifications for playing my part when it comes to work in difficult country.
