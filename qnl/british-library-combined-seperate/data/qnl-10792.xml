It also includes discussion of the Sultan's wish to import a machine gun into Bombay during one of his visits, for the purpose of having the weapon repaired and re-exported to Muscat.In addition, the correspondence briefly discusses the Sultan's proposed visits to Bagdad [Baghdad], Kuwait and Bahrain in August/September 1937, and his wish to visit the Viceroy in India later that same year.
