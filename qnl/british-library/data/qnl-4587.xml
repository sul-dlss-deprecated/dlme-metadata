A Court of Enquiry is being held by the R.A.F* into the circumstances in which the machine came down on 9th August. The N.^.F.P. letter below gives an account of what happened during the airmen's stay in tribal territory from the time of the accident up to their arrival at Chora oil route to Peshawar on 12th August. The Afridis as a whole seem to have come ver^ well out of this affair, more particularly in view of the difficult situation created by the attitude of anti-Government elements in opposing the return of the airmen to British territory, .and a reward of Rs.10,000 has been sanctioned in ecognition of their services. Areco^ Military Secretary . For information.I am surprised the R.A.F. have not had some notice of this incident in the Press, for they could have claimed peaceful penetration in this case as against tneir customary pacification by bomb - a pleasing contrast. Mohammed Zaman and Niaz Muhammad are respectaole men who have had relations in Government service, and as these are now excluded therefrom they will be glad to get their share of the 10,000 Indian rupees their good conduct has earned for them. I think it was as well for the airmen that Zaman and Niaz were on the spot as Khushal and Said Anwar are tough customers, the former in particular being a very bad man. He was Commander-in-Chief when the Afridis invaded Peshawar in 1930. During the Kajuri operations a lucky shell, thanks to benign providence, accounted for Khushal T s brother, but despite-all our efforts Khushal himself escaped. Abdul Baqi is very anti Government also, but I am not sure about Subadar Hamesh Gul and Samand (the fact that the former draws a pension no doubt makes him careful). All this is extremely interesting as it gives us an insight into who will be for and who against road making into Tirah. If only the R.A.F. could drop a bomb .on Khushal beforehand it would save a lot of trouble. Abdul Baqi gave a lot of (not very reliable) information regarding Soviet intrigues in Afghanistan and tribal territory to Moghal Baz Khan, P-A, Khyber - see P.Z. 939/34. Samand is the name of one of the two Afridis, believed to be Bolshevik agents, who tried to get in touch with the Bokharan A aha j arm in Peshawar - see Mr. Caroe’s letter of 7th August, 1934, at P.Z. 5497/34. ^ JuJaM^n 2^.

The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India In the Foreign and Political Department. Forced landing of an aeroplane at Khanki Bazar. MS* - 5 Sir, 3 Y/ith reference to the correspondence ending with this office Clear Line wire No. nil, dated the 12th August 1934, I am directed to report the following fur ther facts regarding the forced landing of the aeroplane. 2. The aeroplane came down at about 8.30 A.M. at Bhutan in Qambar Khel country, 6 miles south-west of Bagh. The aeroplane first struck trees on the side of a large hill, and rolled over down the hill. Flight Lieute nant Sinclair was found by a Bar Qambar Khel in the machine, while Aircraftsman Watson was thrown a distance of about 20 yards from it. One Awal Khan took them to his house, shut the door and prevented access to other people, and then sent information to Niaz Mohammad, the most important elder in the immediate vicinity. 3. The Bhutan Mullah (father of Mullah Abdul Baqi) was in the village at the time. During the day Khushal EnaosoRtHtoanTsaid Anwar and others arrived. There was, there- inoia foreign sECRmRrb ^ conslderal;)le an t 1 - Gove mment party present early H 6 s£p ijn 'Ihe; proceedings. Awal Khan and Niaz I.nhammad were, 24 F -Waiver, able to arrange that the two airmen remained undisturbed in Awal Khan’s house while messages were sent8 . tc Nawab Muliainmaci Zairan Khan 'by Nlaz Muhammad asking him i:o come from Khaist. 4. At about 7 A.M. on the morning of 10th of August Compounder Abdur Rahman accompanied by Mullah israr-ud-Din arrived from the Kurram Agency with medicines and supplies from Captain B.PoRoss-Hurst, M.C., Political Agent, Kurram,- ':hey would have arrived earlier, but for misinformation as regards the exact point of the crash. 15. At about 10 A.M. on 10th August Nawab Muhammad / zeimn Khan arrived with Doctor Autar Singh, but finding *:he Compounder already there sent Autar Singh away. 6. By this time according to the Political Agent, Khyber*s information, three parties had been formed. The first led by Khushal Khan and Said Anwar said that they would pay Rs. 10,000 Kabuli in return for the airmen, their intention being to take them to the Afghans 0 The second party including Mullah Abdul Baqi, Subedar Hamesh Gul and Samand, said that a jirga should be held to decide matters. The third party headed by the Nawab and Niaz Vluharrmad insisted that the airmen must be sent back immediately to British Territory 0 7 e During this discussion Niaz Muhammad had the airmen moved to his own house. In the meanwhile the Compounder was attending the patients, and as splints had to be made for Flight Lieute nant Sinclair T s arm and leg, it was some time before they were able to travel. At about 2 or 3 P.M. the Nawab»s party having prevailed they were both removed on beds by a Qambar Khel carrying party, and arrived in the evening at Khaist where they stayed in the Nawab T s house (about one and a half miles from Dwa-Toi.)On the ll*3h they ;;er*e orout;ht by the same party of carriers, who would not relinquish them through ZaKJha Khel and Mallkdln Fhel county, at a speed of about 3 miles per hour to Chora, which they reached at 10,30 P.M. Leav ing Chora at 4,30 t- ,U * on the morning of 12th August, the airmen reached, the Ambulance which had been brought to the Chora road as far as possible at 8.30 A.M. 9 - His Excel].ency considers that in view of the inherent difficulties of the situation the Afridis did remarkably well in overcoming influential opposition and effecting the return of the Airmen, The situation he understands, v/as at one time tense, if not critical, owing to faction feeling end to the attitude of anti-Government elements. Owing t: the importance of confirming the pre cedent established, on the results now reported, His Excellency authorissd the Political Agent, Khyber, to pay a reward of Rs. 10,000 to the Afridis. 10* It is established that the aeroplanes were f i.red at when flying over Afridl country and this aspect of the case is receiving separate attention, prima facie it would appear that the Aircraft were flying too low and thus offering provocation ,vhich it is, in the nature of things, impossible to expect Afridl tribesmen to resist. This matter, however, will no doubt be cleared up by the Court of Inquiry being hell by the Royal Air Force. A- doctor was sent from Hangu by the Deputy Com missioner, Kohat, through Orakzal country, but only arrived at Bhutan after the departure of the Airmen.
