The first folio of the volume contains a list of contents that is not entirely accurate. The volume does begin with a report entitled 'Report on the Trade of Oman, Bahrein [
                           sic], and Arab Ports in the Persian Gulf', which is dated 12 April 1904; however, the remainder of the volume contains only the following trade reports:trade reports for Bahrain for the financial years of 1904-1905, 1913-1914, 1916-1917, 1917-1918 and 1919-1920;trade reports for Muscat for 1913-1914, 1918-1919, 1919-1920, 1921-1922 and up to and including 1931-1932.Aside from these reports the volume consists of brief letters and memoranda between the Political Agent, Kuwait, and his corresponding officers in the Gulf, which serve as evidence that the trade reports for the places listed in the contents were received by the Political Agent, even though only the Bahrain and Muscat reports mentioned above are present.Each report relating to Bahrain and Muscat provides a summary of the year's trade. Appended to each report are tables of statistics that contain details of imports and exports (i.e. quantities and values of goods) and shipping returns, not only for the year in question but also for the two preceding financial years.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00001a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
