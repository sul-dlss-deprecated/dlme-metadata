BRITISH 3MBASSY&gt; BAGDAD. 3rd March, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to report that the Iraqi Goverrment are taking steps for the formation of a anall river fleet. This idea may have Been suggested to them By the existence of a Persian fleet with its Base at Mahammerah, But I have little douBt that they have Been Brought to the point of action By their experience during the Euphrates rising in the spring, when two armed vessels which were hastily fitted out By the Director of the Port of Basra rendered considerable assistance to the Government By their successful operations in and about the Hammar lake. 2. Colonel Ward, who ms asked to submit recommend ations regarding the type of vessels required, informs me that the government have now practically decided to purchase five vessels - one 150 foot quarter paddle Wheel vessel, two 100 foot quarter Paddle Wheel vessels, and tv/o 45 foot motor Boats, 'ihe Inspector-General of the Iraqi Army was consulted regarding their armament, which will Be as followss The 150 foot vessel. One 3.7* howitzer. One 12-pounder gun. Two Stocks a Mortars with 4 mountings. Eourmachine guns. Ihe Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., e tc •, etc ./ ... •&gt; etcPour machine guns* ^ach 45 foot motor boat * Two machine guns* 3. The cost of this fleet, which is estimated at ID.127,000, is to be spread over three years, and a draft bill now before parliament provides for the allotment of ID.60,000 during the coming financial year. Colonel Ward informs me that this sum will meet the cost of the largest vessel and her a mament, and that ha i 8 only awaiting the formal santion of parliament before calling for tenders. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s charge d’Affaires at Tehran and to the Political Heal dent in the Persian GUlf. 1 have the honour to be with the highest resepct, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, ARCHIBALD CLARF-KEBR.CONFIDENTI AL No. 0/166 4 ri’ ’ 3&gt;7 The Hon’ble the Political ResidenTm the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Political Agent, Kuwait. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document^).

It has not been possible to ascertain the cost of mortars. 2. You may point out to ira^ Government that as r»hat-el-Arab is one of our vital lines of com munication we shall certainly do everything in our power to safeguard it. irinolpai danger still lies in mining by German aircraft. There is now also possibility of submarine threat by Japan but we consider we should be in a better position to deal with this threat if we have these vessels at our free disposal. - RETAXANDUM - m \mCONFIDENTIAL.
