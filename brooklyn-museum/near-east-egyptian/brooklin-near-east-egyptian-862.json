Osiris&rsquo;s tightly wrapped mummy shroud and his crook and flail (symbolizing kingship) point to the legend of Osiris&rsquo;s murder, mummification, and subsequent resurrection as the ruler of the underworld. The cobra held by his wife, Isis, represents the magic that revived her husband and guarded their son, Horus. As the rightful heir to Osiris&rsquo;s throne and the embodiment of kingship, the falcon-god Horus wears the Double Crown. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnimals can also reveal divine qualities. The cow or cow-human forms of Hathor refer to her role as provider of milk to Horus and to young kings of Egypt. Bastet, another benevolent female deity, appears as a cat or cat-headed woman, carrying a basket and sistrum. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertain deities, including Neith, Ptah, Nefertem, and Imhotep, were portrayed in human form. The ancient protectress Neith, associated with war and hunting, wears the flat-topped Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The Memphite creator-god Ptah holds a staff with hieroglyphs for life and permanence. Ptah&rsquo;s son, Nefertem, a lotus on his head (symbolizing rebirth), defends Maat with his scimitar. Imhotep, the deified architect of Djoser&rsquo;s pyramid, shares Ptah&rsquo;s close-fitting cap, and the papyrus on his lap emphasizes wisdom and creativity.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2010-05-05", "date_added": "2011-01-20 15:04:16", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "05.394", "object_id": 3223}, {"accession_number": "08.480.24", "object_id": 3234}, {"accession_number": "53.78", "object_id": 3584}, {"accession_number": "37.356E", "object_id": 4027}, {"accession_number": "37.357E", "object_id": 4028}, {"accession_number": "37.376E", "object_id": 4032}, {"accession_number": "37.565E", "object_id": 4047}, {"accession_number": "86.226.17", "object_id": 4244}, {"accession_number": "05.395", "object_id": 17427}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.05.393_wwg8.jpg", "id": 75185, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.05.393_wwg8.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.05.393_wwg8.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 66, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 133, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 266, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 533, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1067, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.05.393_wwg8.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "West Wing gallery 8 installation", "caption": " <em>The God Nefertem</em>, ca. 664-525 B.C.E. or later.
