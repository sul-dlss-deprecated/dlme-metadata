(iii) if is not clear from paragraph 6 of your express letter under reference what the position of ’’ordinary international mails* including registered mails' has been in the past. In the first place, does 'inter national mails' in this context mean simply mails which are international because they pass between two separate countries, namely* Iran and Bahrein ? Am 1 to under stand that letters, whether registered or not, cannot be exchanged direct between Iran and Bahrein, but must travel vis India unless I give an opinion in favour of direct exchange ? What has been the practice hitherto ? (iv) How are accounts settled between the Government of India and the Iranian Government for the conveyance of mails, terminal charges, etc. ? I imagine that each has a claim against the other, and that whichever ewes trie other most eventually remits a draft for the balance. Is the Government of India in a position, under whatever arrangements exist for the settling of accounts, to recover the 14.7b gold francs due for 1G36 in spite of the objections of the Iranian Government ? But even if there were a balance in favour of the Iranian Government , which would be necessary to enable such action to be taken, it may be contrary to the terms of the Parcel Post Con vention of Cairo for disputed charges t c be levied with out reference to the central authority in Switzerland. 4. / Have}-) 3. i These queries ere based on the assumption that in Your hordsnip's express letter under reference you are referring only to parcels for Bahrein, end not for parcels destined for places beyond Bahrein which are sent there for onward transmission.

(222/3/40) 19ih February 1940. My Lord Marquess, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt ol Your Lordship’s express letter No. D.3559-N/39 of the 19th January on the subject of the exchange of letters and parcels between Iran and Bahrein. 2. Before reaching any definite conclusion in thismatuer I should be grateful for further information on several points which are not clear to me. While these points are be ing examined I see no reason, in view of the attitude of tne Iranian government towards British passports bearing endorse ments for Bahrein and even Kuwait, why Bahrein should not^ continue to return to Bandar Abbas parcels for Bahrein winch the Iranian postal authorities send there direct, instead of sending them to Bomoay or Karachi to be forwarded. 3. The points on which I should be grateful for information are as follows:- (i) Am 1 to understand from the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Your Lordship’s express letter under reference that Bahrein is considered part of India for postal purposes? (ii) In his telegram No.34 of the 27th September Sir H. Seymour reported that the Iranian Government were complaining about mails in general, and not only about parcels. The Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that there had been a cnange in the practice as to the ’’feuilles d’avis' accompanying mails from London to Bandar Aboas via Bahrein. Have there been any such changes, or was the Director General perhaps trying to draw a red herring across the x track owing to his inability to produce a convincing answer on the subject of parcels? (iii) It is not clear from paragraph 6 of your express letter under reference what the position of ”ordinary inter national mails, including registered mails'* has been in the past. In the first place, does 'international mails' in this context mean simply mails which are international because they pass between two separate countries, namely, Iran and Bahrein ? Am I to understand that letters, whether registered or not, d&amp;nnot be exchanged direct between Iran and Bahrein, but must travel via India unless I give an opinion in favour of direct exchange? Yfoat nas been the practice hitherto? (iv) How are accounts settled between the Government of India and the Iranian Government for the conveyance of mails, terminal charges, etc.? I imagine that each has a claim against the other, and that whichever owes the other most eventually remits a draft for the balance. Is the Government of India in a position, under whatever arrangements exist for the settling of accounts, to recover the 14.75 gold francs due for 1936 in spite of the objections of the Iranian Government? But even if there were a balance in favour of the Iranian Government, which would be necessary to enable such action to be taken, it may be contrary to the terms of the Parcel Post Convention of Cairo for disput ed charges to be levied without reference to the central authority in X Switzerland. . 4. These” queri6s are based on the assumption that in Your Lordship’s express letter under reference you are referring only to parcels for Bahrein, and not for parcels destined for places beyond Bahrein which are sent there for onward transmis sion. I have etc. , His Excellency Sd/- R. W. Bullard. The Right Honourable The Marquess of Linlithgow, K.T., G.C.I.S., etc., NEW DELHI.I 4 dated the 17th July 1^0, of India in the internal Copy of a letter N°.F.2Q 4- _ from the Secretary to the SoTernmen u wx Affairs Department, Simla, to His Majesty s Minister, ^nran. Subject;- Exchange of letters and parcels between ^ran and Bahrain and between Iran and Muscat. i am directed to refer to the correspondence endingjrith your despatch No.21 (222/3/40), dated the 19th i'eoruary 1940 and to enclose an extract of a note dated the 1st ^une -^^0 recorded by the IndiaxPosts and Telegraphs Department giving the information on the various points mentioned oy you. ?. In this connection I am to state that the uscat post office which is also under the Indian Posts ana TeleCgraphs Department has been exchanging both letter and parcel with Iran for a long time. This practice ne.s be on irregul r as the mails should‘have passed through Bombay or jjlaracni which are the Indian offices of exchange. Aa in the case of Bahrain, the Iranian Administration have not oeen af fording the terrnainal hharges due to India on par del a ' j6u P ^ to Muscat direct, unfortunately no account of tne charge due under this nead has been kept. It is desirable to regularise the position and there seem to be two alternatives - (i) Ui&gt; to maintain that Muscat, like Bahrain, posoassea no post office capable of exchanging international parcels ana that parcels for Muscat shoal d therefore be sent itjc to Bombay or Karachi for re-fo rwarding; , . » __ . to agree to Iranian parcels being forwardea to muscat only if the Iranian Government agree to pay the terminal charges* . 3. In view of the serious delay involved by the adoption of the first alternative and the fact that the Iranian uroyeinment t shadowy claims to regard inhabitants of Muscat as Iranian subjects are much less stressed than their claim to Banrciin, it is possible that theylmight agree to the 2nd alternative. If, however, you consider that they are unlikely tu so, the only course open seems to be, as in the case of Bahrain, to adopt the first alternative. The Government of India would be grateful for your views on this point. 4. As regards letter mails sent direct to Muscat from Iran there is no objection to the present practice oeing continued as the question of terminal charges does not arise. Copy of a Indian Posts note dated the 1st June 194C and Telegraphs Department. recorded by the Information regarding the several points raised by the Kin is ter, 'ieheran, in his letter dated the 19th February 1^4u is given below . . Para 3 (i). The reply is in the affirmative. (ii) This relates to the despatch of air mails irom London to Bunder Abbas via Bahrein. The London post office commenced despatching Closed air mall bags lor Bunder Aobas through the Bast bound Imperial Airways service which are offloaded at Bahrein. The first despatch consisting of tnree such bags was received MxociMWflkxkxawaxi at Bahrein on the 1st May 1939. These bags are received as closed transit mails advised in the way bills (Feuille d’avis) received by the Bahrein post office from the Imperial Airway s.and are J forwarded to destination by the Bahrein post office insiae its own bag, which necessitate their being advised in part I / of the^said way bill. This practice is being followed from May 1939 and tnere has been no change in it since. This shows that air mails from London to Bunder Abbas are :ecci ;e at Bahrein by air and from there are sJent direct to dt;Swina- tion by the next Slow Mail sea service. Th 6 . . . . , # » . IS iThe sea fesu borne mails from London to Bunder Abbas do not pass through any inaian office ox exchange* (iii) The practice hitherto has been that letter fflaxl x articles are excnanged mxxxnatxlkxjBgkiXkxxjmItgggaLLtJLaLxyx with Iren by the Bahrein post office direct and not through the intermediary of the properly constituted offices of exchange on the side of India, vi^x. Bombay and Karachi. The mails are international mails as they are exchanged between two independent countries. Such mails must pass throuarh a specified office of exchange. (ivy parcel post accounts with Iran are always settled direct with that Administration and not through the Inter national Bureau, Berne. Both India and Iran are parties to the Parcel Post Agreement of Cairo f and in disputes ox this nature, the parties concerned cam invoke the assistance of the international Bureau, for a settlement. In the present case, this has not been done so far, aa Iran may raise the same claim that Bahrein is located in their territory. No other course seems to be open to this Department for recovering the amount from the Iranian Administration. It may be mentioned in this connection that in addition to 14.75 gold francs due to Indiafrom Iran for 1936, further sums of 3.50 and 17.40 gold gxx francs for the years 1937 and 1838 respectively are also due on the same account. The information icr the year 1939 is not yet available. J.at t^r. The Minister’s presumption is correct. Further enquiries made in the matter have also snown that, Iran does not send any parcels to Bahrein direct destined for places beyond Banrein.-—.&gt; mu 3483 Telegram XX No. 159 dated (and reed) 3lst July 1940.

A copy of the communication from Messrs. Hrray Mackenzie and do., Ltd., to the Sub-Postmaster, Bahrain is also enclosed herewith.

With reference to your letter No. J-1 j uated the ^6tn July 1940, I beg to say tnat the action of the Iranian Post Office is without any precedent. The fact seems to be tnat the Irani Government claims that the Bahrain Island belong to Iran and ail the rules and regulations in connection with the mails to and from B dirain should be the same as those m force in Iran\for Irani inland post offices. From the remarks on tne attached letter bill it is clear they want this office^should mark in all tne forma despatched and labels on the marl oags ♦ the station from as 'Bahrain'Tran” as they show in their own despatches to Bahrain. They want tnis office should use ail the^Postal stationery for preparing mails as is done in the. Iranian post offices in tne Irani vernacular and not according to the InternationalxiuMX convention wnich is not acceptable. As present Bahrain is considered and Shown in tne forms as an Indian inland and foreign post office for Iran and therefore has been using forms meant for trie foreign post oil ices to prepare mails for all.foreign countries according to the International convention. Banrain letter bill dated the 15th July 1940 received back from Bushire withi eu remirks in Irani vernacular is enclosed herwith for favour of perusal. Contents of the hag as detailed in the bill was received correct. On receipt of the Banrain nail bag.dated the 15th July 1940 the matter was reported to tne Political Agent by myself personally explaining ail about tne Busnire remarks etc.,and their action without any base ana reasons in returning bag containing important political mails. »he political Agent advised me to withhold delivery of the articles received bacx undelivered and of those received from Buanire for delivery at Bahrain and wait for further instructions from him. As/—As wired on Uie 30tn July 4940.

The same form of feuille d^vis has been used without any alteration both before and since May 1939. 3. Probably the Iranian Governments contention is based on the fact that before air mail bags were sent from London for Bandar Abbas (in about July 1939), only local ordinary and registered correspondence was sent from Bahrain to Persian ports, except Abadan and Bushire. They were therefore accompanied by a ^registered letter invoice” (form C 17) instead of a feuille d’avis (form C 16), the latter being only used when the bag contains consignments of different categories. 4.

C.16 is advice of despatch end gives details of contents of mail and C.17 gives details of registered articles only. Both forms have to be used with each mail.

(c) Postmaster has tried sending airmail bags this way, accompanied by C.17 but without success, and th ;se are now being sent through B.I. Company to deliver them to the postal authorities in Bandar Abbas as direct mail from London. PoliticalNote regarding despatch of mnlls to Bushire and Rendar Abbas from Bahrain* Secretary and Postmaster were present Secretary said that Iranians say that prior to May 1939 mail bags were accompanied by Form C.17 only and that now a different form is being used. The Postmaster explained that no transit mails for Bushire are received in Bahrain and that Bahrain mail for Bushire is now sent through Basra. The Postmaster has tried sending Bahrain bags direct to Bushire accompanied by Form C.16 or C. 17 but they have been returned by the Iranian authorities. Mails for Bandrr Abbas are now sent via Muscat. The Post master also produced a letter from the Iranian Posts and Telegraphs Department, Bandar Abbas, saying that mails cannot be accepted as they are prepared on List C.17. 2. Secretary proposed that Postmaster might omit using these forms and instead prepare a kacha chalan, a specimen of which might be prepared by him and given to Secrerary together with copies of Forms C.16 and C.17. The matter could then be taken up through the Legation at Tehran and if the Iranian authorities agreed bags could be sent accompanied by kacha chalans instead of Forms C.16 and C.17 to which they object. Secretary also suggested that all Agency mails for Bushire excepting very bulky and non-urgent packages be sent direct to Bushire by hand of the commanders of mail boats until the mail question is settled. Bulky and non-important articles might be sent via Consul, Basra, as before. 23rd January 1941.Telegram From To No. Q Political Resident, Bushire. Political Agent, Bahrain.

Memorandum Since 1939 there has been continual difficulty in the despatch of mails from Bahrain to Iranian ports. The Iranian Government contend that, prior to May 1939, Form R.P. 32 was used when mails were sent from Bahrain to Iranian ports. They allege that the Bahrain Post Office then began to use Forms C 16 and C 17, which are unacceptable to the Iranian Government. 2. The Honourable the Political Resident has directed me to ascertain the true facts. In particular he wishes to know : (a) When the use of Form R.P. 32 was discontinued; (b) Why the use of Form R.P. 32 was discontinued; (c) How long Form R.P. 32 had been in use before it was discontinued; (d) By what authority, or under whose instructions, Form R.P. 32 was used; and (e) By what authority, or under whose instructions, the use of R.P. 32 was discontinued. 3.

I regret that it is not possible to ascertain true facts locally. Records in Agency give no clue and documentary evidence in Bahrain Post Office not available as records of Form R.P. 32 are kept only for eighteen months. 3. Oral evidence available here is equally unsatisfactory. The Sub Postmaster assumed charge in March 1940 after the use of Form R.P. 32 had been discontinued, and has no personal know ledge of facts. His staff can give no information which is either definite or reliable. It was apparently on the basis of informa tion supplied by postal staff that Howes sent his misleading telegram of 25th September 1940, and no better source of informa tion is now available. 9 C, Political Agent, Bahrain.

My Lord Marqpiese, In my despatch No.250 of the 27th November 1940 addressed to the i-'oreign Office and repeated to the Government of India under number 142, I suggested that the controversy about the parcels mail from Persian ports to Bahrain should be left until the more pressing matter of the letter mails had been settled. l&gt;rovided that the f/ 3ahrain postal authorities revert to the use of form R.P.32, f as^recommended in the Political Resident’s telegram No. 34 of the 4th February, the question of the letter mails can, I hope, be regarded as settled, in that the Persian postal authori ties should no longer refuse to accept letter mails from Jahrain or to deliver the letters to the addressees, though there remains open a subsidiary point to which reference is made below in paragraph 3 of this despatch. is enclosed, the X^ersian Ministry of Foreign Affairs raise once more the question of the refusal of the Bahrain Post-Office to p accerjt parcels sent direct from Persia. In my reply, a copy or which is also attached, I have pointed out that the agreements recently concluded did not cover the parcel post, and explained that the difficulty arose from the refusal of the Persian authorities to pay the tenainax charges on parcels sent to Bahrain. In order, however, to foster the more conciliatory spirit which we find at present in'the Persian Government in the matter of Bahrain, I suggest that the Bahrain Post-Office should be instructed to accept parcels despatched from Persia, but that when informing the Persian Government of this concession I should say that it does not denote any change whatsoever in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the status of Bahrain. When the normal procedure is restored again, the statements of account showing arrears of terminal charges due from the Persian Government should, I suggest, be sent in again, and this should be done annually with*the addition of the latest annual account. The Persian Government would probably not reply, but we should not trouble about that. If they reply that the charges are not due we should defend our position but should not, I suggest, discontinue the acceptance of parcels from Persia direct to Bahrain. 3 . My note of reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks that the practice of charging double the internal postage from the a dressee on letters sent from Bahrain to Persia should be abandoned. The Persian Government will not give up entirely a . ractice by which they assert their alleged right to Bahrain, but that they should charge a fine as well as the single postage is objectionable and I hope to induce them to compromise on this point. 2 In a note copy of which /4.

The parcel post is a separate question, the procedure of which the Imperial Ministry complain having been adopted by the Bahrain authorities because the Imperial Iranian Government still owe the terminal charges for several years on p&amp;reels despatched from Tran to ’ahrain. 'evertheless Hie ajesty!s Legation will examine the question of the parcel post without delay and will see what can be done to find a solution satis factory to both parties# 2# Meanwhile His lajesty'n Legation learn that the Iranian postal authorities are requiring the addressees of letters from Bahrain to pay double the ordinary Iranian postage. When the recent agreement was made His Majesty’s Legation understood that in such cases the Iranian authorities, in order to maintain their point of view, would collect the Iranian postage from the addressee, and they had no objection to that procedure. They hold, however, that to levy a fine by collecting twice the ordinary postal rate is contrary to the spirit of the agreement, and they beg the Imperial Ministry to have orders issued to the postal authorities concerned not to collect the double postage in future.CONFIDENTIAL.

Also included are the negotiations with the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the eventual resolution of the situation in 1942.Also mentioned in the file is the temporary problem in April and May 1941 of the newly established Iraqi Censorship Office in Basra opening all mail being sent through there and the need to ensure confidential mail was not opened by them.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 194-204. These file notes relate only to the correspondence from folio 62 onwards, the correspondence on folios 2-16, and possibly also folios 17-61 appear to have been placed in the file at a later date after the file notes were compiled.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, Secretary to the External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sub-Postmaster, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003a1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
