His arrival was followed at the end of September by an extensive raid into British Baluchis tan. The local forces of the Nazim of Uekran were besieged at Hand and Tamp„ the Mekran Levy Corps fought with little zeal, and a serious disaster was only avoided by the sudden withdrawal of the raiders. It xs not certain whether Germans took part; but it appQtirs -Patf the raiders had a gun wnich could only have been worked by skilled persona. The effect of the raid was greatly to dishearten the people of Mekran. It was in vain that the Agent to the Governor-General begged for troops, however few, representing that if the chiefs saw that Government would not help them they would not help themselves, and that if once the tide of unreat set eastwards there was nothing to atop it short of the Indian frontier.. The Government of India in their aversion to being drawn into military operations declined to take the situation seriously. Under pressure from the Secretary of State they have recently so far modified this attitude as to allow Lieut.-Col. Dew, the Political Agent, to tour in the interior with an escort of 200 Levies, while Captain Keyes has been sent to recruit a local force, and the Levy Corps itself has been brought up to full strength, a third British officer being attached to it» Nevertheless the position remains exceedingly unsatisfactory. In beistan and Kain little active hostility has been saown to us - though some anti-British feeling has been displayed - on the other hand the Persian officials have helped the German parties in every way, and down to the beginning of January had received no orders from Teheran to do otherwise. An Indianforce of about 1 0 200 men, with 200 or 300 Hazara levies (recruited at Meshed) hold the line of the Afghan frontier from Ho bat to Birjand (the northern portion of the frontier being held by Cossacks). So iar only one German party appears to have got through (or possibly two) 9 and the other day an advanced detachment was headed off from Neh and a German officer capturedo Some difficulty is being experi enced in supplying our force, the local merchants holding up stocks. Apparently also the chiefs are not anxious to allow their men to enlist under us 0 Meshed is more or less under Russian control*, Yet even there the Karguzar, under orders from the Persian Government; has managed to convey over 200 escaped Austrian prisoners to Tehran, The causes of this state of things deserve some mention. Briefly they are (1) . Success of Turco-Gerraan propaganda by free bribery, appeal to religious fanaticism, and the studiously fostered belief in German invincibility as evidenced by (2) . Military and diplomatic successes of the Central Powers elsewhere. (3) . Failure of British arms wherever they have engaged the Turks - Dardanelles, Mesopot- amia. Aden, and Egypt ( where the fact that the Turks were allowed to reach the Canal and get away intact has not escaped notice in the East). (4) . Profound hatred of Russia, intensified by the execution of the Tabriz clergy and bombardment of Meshed shrine, ana extending to us because we are allies/and neither prevented nor disavowed these outrages. (5) 0 The policy of the Anglo-Russian Convention. (6) - A certain amount of genuine nationalism. (7) 0 The forcible-feeble policy of His Majesty 4 5 6 7 * 9 b Government during the last 5 years in the south, where reparation has been claimed forI PI for successive outrage®t&gt; but never exacted, and where, when we have struck, it has never been with sufficient force to attain our object or inspire respect. Of these causes 4, 5 9 &amp; 6 are permanent, and indicate that even when it becomes clear that the allies are goin^; to win we must not expect an active revulsion of feeling in our favour 0 and that the moral effect of Russian victories e 0 go at Erzerum will not help us greatly. The practical conclusion is that no single dramatic coup will suffice: we must not only strike - we must make good. Mj'SITUATION ON THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER 0 Early in 1915 the danger point was on the Khost border. But the crushing defeat of the Zadrans on 27th March took the heart out of the tribes in that region* and the danger point shifted to the north. From April to October the Northern frontier, from the Mohmnd border to the Black Mountain, was in a state of ferment* but since the last defeat of the LJohmands on 9th October the tribes have been mainly concerned with internal politics and mutual recriminations. From that date organised tribal disturbance may be said to have ceased, and the frontier has merely been liable to raids on an unusually extensive scale* This is especially true of Waziristan, where - in addition to daily raiding in large parties - the Mahsuds in November sent in an insolent ultimatum* which they followed up by an attack on a picket at Khajuri Kach, and, at the end of last month, by a raid on the veterinary hospital at Bannu. The outstanding fact in our favour is that the Afridi - on whom, politically and strategically, the frontier hinges - remain absolutely loyal. Their allowances were doubled at the beginning of the war, and they have resisted all intrigue from Afghan sources to throw over The present position appears to be that brooding over the present lull there is an air of expectancy. In November th® general belief on the fronti^i was what the Amir had given a definite negative answer to the German Mission: more lately this has given place to a revival ofPOLITICAL SITUATION IN ' AFGHANISTANo The Amir has given repeated assurances and practical proof of his desire to maintain neutrality. But the arrival of a German party in the country in August ia beginning to have its effecto The Germans, Turks and Indians were at first honorifically interned in the Babar and the Amir avoided giving them an interviewo But by the end of the year all restrictions seem to have been removed. They were said to be surveying the road from Kabul to Jalalabad, pi inning light railways from Herat to Ksmdahar and Kabul, and inspecting munitions factories. Nasrulla and4uty ra tulla Khans are stated to have openly said that thou$i the Amir may be bound by treaties and promises to the English, they are not, and that they will join the jehad in the spring. The Amir is said to have surmioned a Council of his principal advisers, irapressingon them his own opinion that the time for jehad had not yet corae 0 The Council’s report has been kept very secret^ but their final reco/zniendation is said to have been that the Az&amp;ir should await the result of the campaign against Egypt. The most recent developments are shown in the attached telegrams. The impression they leave is that the Amir is still loyal and playing for time; and besides an honest wish to keep his word, he has a genuine fear for his throne inspired by the recent attempt of the sons of Ayah Kh&amp;n to escape to Afghanistan. But he desires to be y trjpque naratxiB- and as time passes will be increasingly at the mercy ot circumstances. Among these, the attitude of the Persian Government will doubtless be import*- &gt;, and it is for this reason that the Goverrcnent ofof India have emphasised the desirability of concluding an alliance with ito Per contra the spectacle of the Persian people defying their Government and arising in their wt*th against the Kafir is not likely to be lost on the inflafl»nable elements in Afghani 3 tan 0 and my as easily turn the scale against the Amir and us. An English employe at Kabul who passed through Peshawar early in January said that hostility to Englishmen was so great 5 and that preparations for war were being made so openly &gt; that he feared to remain there any longer. It is significant too that the Mohmands, who are generally cold-shouldered at Kabul, have recently had much favour shown to them. The best that can be said for the situation in Afghanistan is that it is * touch and go'.From Viceroy, 22nd December 1915. Foreign Secret. Afghanistan. Amir accorded British Agent at Kabul an interview on llth December, at which, with locked doors, His Majesty spoke very frankly. He said he had received King-Emperor’s letter as (? well as) letter forwarding it, and was replying at once as regards part of it, but that question of increase in his subsidy was still under his con sideration, and he would reply about this shortly. We have considered (sic) greatly disappointed at amount of increase, considering all the difficulties he had had to face, but he concluded by saying he was not a double dealer, and that British Agent might assure Government in plain and repeated terms that he was the true friend of British, and intended to maintain neutrality to the last so long as internal interests of Afghanistan were not exposed to danger. From Viceroy, xth February 1916. Secret. Please refer to correspondence ending with our telegram of ^4th December regarding attitude of Amir of Afghanistan. British Agent at Kabul stated in letter received on 2nd February that on 25th January Amir summoned him to another private interview (see our telegram of 22nd December;. Amir reiterated determination to maintain neutrality, and stated that on 29th January he intended to hold full Durbar of Tribal Chiefs, Ac., and make announcement to this effect to them. Durbar was necessitated by general popular excitement caused by reaction from Persia and presence of Turko-German mission in Kabul. Announce ment would be to same effect as before, but would be couched in terms calculated to assuage popular feeling. These terms British Agent must not misunderstand and should assure Government of India of Amir’s firm resolve to maintain neutrality. Pamphlets explaining real meaning of Jehad and Ghaza would be published after Durbar. Amir seemed to be feeling extreme difficulty of his position, but to be confident that he could weather it. He talked freely and it would appear sincerely of whole situation. On 3rd February letters from Amir dated Jellalabad to King Emperor and to myself were received. Translations have been sent to India Office by weekly letter of 4th February. Letter to King Emperor expresses formal thanks for His Majesty’s letter and asserts intention to maintain neutrality. Latter letter refers to increase in subsidy which Amir says his Ministers have represented as being inadequate in view of value of Afghan neutrality and the expense of maintaining it. Copy of my reply to Amir goes by next mail. Further letter dated 30th January has been received from Amir asking for payment of 44 lakhs, part in gold and part in rupees, out of balance of his subsidy which amounts to 49 lakhs odd. Demand for this large payment is ominous, but Amir may actually require money ; he doubtless also wants to have it safe and may be testing our good faith and solvency. In any case we shall of course pay the amount promptly. From Viceroy, 16th February 1916. Secret. Attitude of Amir. Please see our telegram of the 8th instant. Following particulars have been received of proceedings of Durbar held at Kabul on 29th January. Durbar was attended only by usual Durbaris and no foreigners were present. Large crowds assembled outside in belief that Jehad would be proclaimed. Amir dwelt on impossibility of forecasting ultimate outcome of war. The point on which he laid great stress was the condition of chaos in Persia and deplorable results of want of co-operationbetween people and governing body. He impressed upon hearers absolute necessity for unity and co-operation in a nation and concord between rulers and ruled. Amir stated he had ordered Durbar to be held at every Pro vincial centre, and circulars to be issued to all representatives, so that eadi individual might know how matters stood and be impressed with the necessity for allegiance to the Amir and united action. Members of the Royal Family had been deputed to explain these circulars to the people and ascertain to what extent the Amir could depend on their acting in concert with him should exigency arise. Result of popular response to call would be announced at another Durbar. Circulars were read out and Nasrullu made a few remarks by way of appeal to the people to abandon domestic differences and rally under national flag if they want to save faith and country from foreign interference. Prayers were then offered for Moslems in general and Afghan Moslems in particular. Although the words of the Amir are open to dual interpretation, we prefer to regard them as not in contradiction with his recent assurances.CONCLJSIOM. This being the situation it is hardly necessary to discuss from the political point of view what is likely to be the effect in Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and the frontier of a disaster in Mesopotamia, or of a discovered intention on the part of Germany to make Mesopotamia and/or Persia the main objective in the East, The former is an eventuality which must be considered., As regards the latter - the military probability doesjrf not concern my Department. But from the political point of view it seems to me that the probability is great. Apart from secret information already received as to German intentions there is a strong party which looks for the future of Germany not to the me el water but to the Middle East. It looks to the vast economic resources of that region to supply Germany with raw materials, after the war, by a route which England cannot threaten; and, whatever may happen elsewhere, it hopes to make peace on conditions that will leave Germany in economic possession of Asiatic Turkey, and in a position to begin the next war at the very door of India. For the purposes of this policy the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and a firm footing in Persia are essential, and it is •pledges' (to use the Chancellor’s expression) for securing these two desiderata which are now being sou^it by the eastward thrust. If this view is correct, we may expect to see t as soon as the roads are open, an advance in force into Persia, not necessarily (or even probably) with the intention of trying to march across it - though an attempt on Tehran mi^it be made - but rather to complete the process of raising the Persian tribes, and to provide the necessary moral backing for the advanced German parties working in the eastern provinces, and t hough them toraiat Afghanistan and the frontiaro The deterioration in the situation at Kabul since the arrival of the first German party shows that this is a vary real ian^c^r The Germans are adepts in stage management,, and if, instead of mere talk of a Turkish army advancing on Afghanistan k* 10re beyond all doubt a considerable Turkish force in Persia 8 their game will be made easy 0 It is possible that the capture of Erzerum and the Russian advance to Kermanshah and Khanikin may suffice to wrecrt the whole scheme - especially if we have the good fortune to relieve Kut and are in a position to advance againc But assuming the worst 3 the requirements from the purely local political standpoint of India appear to be;- (1) . the construction at the earliest possible moment of a light railway from Nuahki to Robat, in order that our force in Seistan may be rapidly supported aipplied in any eventuality; (2) . the despatch to Seistan at an early date of a brigade of regular troops. The object of this is not to operate in Persia, for which it would not be beet suited, but to steady Afghanistan, Mekran and Baluchistan and through them the Indian frontier 0 The view is that the physical presence at a central point of regular troops will more than counteract the moral effect of anything the Turks may do farther west or the Germans may say farther east It would be necessary to inform the Amir before this is done 0 (3). The capture or destruction of the German^ bands in eastern Persia. For this we require an irregular iorce under British Officers to carry on an active guerr illa warfare and deprive the Germans of the offensive 0 Lt-^ol. Sir P. Sykes is being sent to organise such agivan to him* In Seistan there is a secure base,, but it will not suffice to work from one point only u (4) o the establishment of a base at Bunder Abbas., both for recruiting and for the support of the Kawam p if he can work down to join hands with a British force thereo This proposition is disputed by the Government of India, and it must be admitted that our information about the state of affairs there is so scanty that it is difficult to form an opinion* The essence is to get into touch with the Kawam, to begin recruiting as soon as possible, and to provide a backing for the irregular force when recruitedo (5) o the recovery of Kerman, presumably by the irregular forces acting from Seistan and Bunder Abbas a (6) o the relief of our force at Bushire by clearing the hinterland as far as the foot of the hills (the task of clearing the road, from Shiraz to DalikL must be left to the Kawanr as soon as he is strong enough, with the help of Soulet if it can be obtained). This will do something to rehabilitate our prestige, and, by encouraging the friendly Khans, help to restore normal conditions. It is obvious that these are merely local pallia* tives. but it is only such measures that fall within the scope of my Department,— . ■ - -ADEN omce August last the British garrison has been beleaguered in the defences of Aden with the result that mos of tie Arabs of the Protectorate have gone over to the Turks and that we have suffered a great loss of 1 Arabia out of which the Germans have not iailed to make capital. It is urgnntly necessary that tnis state of affairs should be remedied with the least possible delay. This department pleaded in August last that General Younghusband should at least clear the Turks out of Lahej before he returned with his brigade to Egypt It is the policy of His Majesty^s Government to detach the a from tne Turks, and, for this purpose, to afford the former all possible support. Instead of doing so, we - tne spectacl e cr being beaten everywhere and our one active ally in western Arabia - the Idriai Saiyid - is left to fi£$vt our battle for us It is undoubtedly no, desirable to embark on operations in the hills of the hinterland or to lock up a substantial force at Iahe,j* but a for consideration whether an overwhelming defeat of the Turks at Lahe.j and their ejection from Sheikh Said would not have such an effect that the lb is Quitt# certain that this would give great iertaken before the hot weather and xble presence of enemy submarines in the Red Sea make it impracticable. it mmIt is submitted in conclusion that the interdepend ence of all these operations on one another, and the inability of the Government of India to furnish further troops (if indeed they have enouph for the defence of the frontier) make it desirable that the Imperial General f should review the situation from the Bosporus to Peshawar as a single theatre for co-ordinated action.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000137_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C145</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000137</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C145</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Political Situation in Persia, the North-West Frontier, Afghanistan, and Aden</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-30T15:14:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (16 folios)</extent><extent>Condition: the ink on folios 125-127 has faded.Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at f 125, and terminates at f 140, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the bottom right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: each section of the item also has a typed pagination sequence; these numbers are located in the top centre of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The memorandum is divided up into four sections and a conclusion. The first (folios 125-130) provides an update on the political situation in Persia, and considers how advantageous/disadvantageous it is to British interests, with specific updates on the following places: Isfanhan [Eşfahān], Fars, Bushire, Kerman, Baluchistan, Seistan [Sīstān va Balūchestān], and Meshed [Mashhad]. There is a running — British — concern over the expansion of German influence, and the operation of German supported 'bands' in Persia; a list of causes is provided on folios 129-130.The second section (folios 131-132) provides an update on the North-West Frontier of India, and the third section (folios 133-134) provides an update on Afghanistan. The latter considers the loyalty — to the British — of the Amir of Afghanistan and the influence of a German party in the country. Three copies of telegrams from the Viceroy of India on the subject of the Amir can be found on folio 135.The fourth section (folios 139-140), on the other hand, is a brief update on the situation of the British garrison at Aden, and considers the necessity (for British military interests) in 'separating the Arabs from the Turks'.The conclusion (folios 136-138) provides suggestions as to the measures that may be taken to improve Britain's geopolitical position in Persia, and mitigate future threats to British India.The author is Sir Arthur Hirtzel, Political Department, India Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000137#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
