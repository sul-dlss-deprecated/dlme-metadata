The importer is an employe of Messrs Petroleum Concession Ltd., who comes from India; and I understand that these prints are made in the neighbourhood of Amritsar. A previous similar instance occurred some months ago, when I asked if the export of these prints from India might be stopped, please. Believe me, Yours sincerely. - S To:- Major R.G.E.W.Alban, O.B.E., I.A., The Agency, MANAMAH: ' Enclos - ■*7 No.1045-7/14 Political Agency, Bnhrain. 4til June, 1941. To The Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer, Memorandum* 0 • 3 lease refer U y :ir letter No. PA/DO/6/287 dated the 2Sth .lay, 1941. 2. Since no law exists prohibiting the export of such prints from India, and since a print that may be considered obscene in cne country is not necesscxrily obscene in another, t'lOre s^em no point in pursuing this aspect of the matter. 3. Tlie photographs, however, have already been destroyed by ry predecessor and taere is thus no evidence against the offender. i£ however thit offence is becoming to . common, I suggest fiat in future you initiate legal action against the offender.
