High Commissioner for Palestine, Jerusalem. : E y t 4423 1 JULW46 4R Dear Bertram Thomas, V —- Many thanks for your letter of 20th June and enclosures which I return herewith. I have looked into the points which you raise in your letter with the following results:- (1) Captain HiAlyard I understand from the Department of the India Office concerned that there can *^ be no question of the decision reached in Captain Hillyard* s case and communica ted to him being reconsidered. This decision does not of course imply any change in the attitude of the India Office towards graduates of the Arab Centre (far from it) but, as you will appreciate, the /regulationsregulations covering recruitment (which were not fulfilled in Captain Hillyard* s case) have to be applied without discrimination of any kind and cannot be relaxed in favour of (2) Captain Murphy I have been in touch with Captain Murphy and understand from him that he has received a telegram from the Political Resident saying that his assignment to your course in Septenber has now had to be cancelled. (3) M. T. Anderson We are referring to the Government of come on the September course. There may be difficulties in this as it may interfere with the normal course of training which the Government of India have for I.P.S. recruits t see what they say. -lit any eaee particular individuals whatever their qualifications may be. / India your suggestion that Anderson might ^t mawbe possible for him to come on a later course if not the one this September. t&gt;. A. K- HAAWSON/o The Secretary , External Department , Lly comments upon Colonel Bertram Thomas's letter of 20th June are as follows H»T» Anderson. This is a question of what should be done :*ith an officer after he has accepted an appointment in the Indian Political Service. I am, therefore, passing it on to Miss I^wis for comment. (2) Captain T.^.D.W* Hilliard. I suggest that the reply to Col. Bertram Thomas in regard to this officer should be on the following lines ’*1 understand from the Department of the India Office concerned that there can be no question of the decision reached in Captain Hilliard's case and communicated to him being reconsidered. This decision does not, of course, imply any change in the attitude of the India Office towards graduates of the Arab Centre but, as you will appreciate, the regulations governing recruitment (which were not fulfilled in Captain Hilliard's case) have to be applied without discrimination of any kind and cannot be relaxed in favour of particular individuals whatever their qualifications may be.' 21st June, 1946.

S« &amp; G» Department* Please see Colonel Bertram Thomas* s letter of the 20th June below* I should be glad to have your oomraents on the two cases mentioned below. 1* M. T. Anderson He has apparently just been selected for the Indian Political Service and is anxious to attend Colonel Bertram Thopas* s course of Arab studies at J erusalem beginning next JfyaBfcteer in view of his ambitions to get to the Persian Gulf cfr Afghanistan.

Government of India may very likely see difficulties tfcJ Anderson being deputed to the Arabic course this October/ 2. Captain T.A.D.W.Hillyard He has apparently already done one of Colonel Bertram Thomas* s courses, is anxious to join the I.P. S. but his application has been turned down by this Office on ground of age. Is there any way of getting round the age disqualification? Apart from this I imagine he might be a useful candidate for the I.P.S.

(b) an application of one of the people on my present course to be considered as a candidate for Government of India Civil or Political Service. , // \ ft wy As regards (a) Government of India vide Priors telegra: i has approved of Murphy now A.P.A. in tiie Gulf - coming on the next course. 3 urphy has not contacted me so may not be keen. How old is he please? II. Would you look at Anderson*s letter. He is one of your recent selections and is very keen to cume. He would I feel get more out of the Course (a bettor ib^t therefore for Government of India) than Murphy, because he would be starting from scratch with all the P.0. Sudan and Colonial Service ^electees (9). Can you I wonder ask G. of I. if they would consider sending Anderson vice Murphy. Regarding (b) and perhaps of most importance please - one Killyard on my present course is keen to come before your selection Board as a candidate for one of the Indian Bervices.

Dear Colonel Bertram Thomas, __ Here, as you requested, I am writing to give you a little i_ rmation of myself and my aspirations that you may have them at hand should you have an opportunity of mentioning to Sir Geoffrey Prior my very strong desire to attend your course. Only one thing has changed since the interview you granted me; on ray return home I found a letter from the India Office in which was contained the welcome news that I had qualified for assignment to the Indian Political Service immediately upon taking up my I.C.o. appointment. As I told you, my aim in applying for this branch of service has ever been to try to get to the Persian Gulf or Afghanistan and I think you agreed that, should I get posted to the Gulf, your course would be of very definite value. At the age of twenty-two I have little to offer in the way of qualifications except an enthusiasm of long standing to work in the Middle East. During my three years with the Indian Army (The Mahar Regiment), I have learnt Urdu to Higher Standard and enough Mahratti to make myself understood on most subjects. The outbreak of war prevented ray going up to Oxford and my academic qualifications are therefore not what I would have wished; however the rough drafts for a biography of Sir Stamford Raffles - which I believe Michael Scott shewed to you in Jerusalem - may have given you some information of this side of ray character. If there is anything further that you would wish to know, I would, of course, be only too glad to tell you. May I end by saying how much I appreciated your granting me an interview yesterday, and how grateful I am for the trouble to which you are going. \ Yours sincerely, (Sd.) M.T.

Such officers would of course have to compete before selection board with other service candidates to India Civil Service and Indian Political Service but qualifications in Arabic and Arabic studies generally would be a strong point in their favour when selection comes to be made. 5 ' Ends. i.

This would be much more satisfactory than trying to take one or two in on short-term contracts. I have discussed the Question with Mr. Clauson and we think it would be worth-while to put the point to Sir Olaf Caroe and make the suggestion that Major Hickinbotham might discuss the whole question with us during his leave and visit the Centre after his leave rather than before it as Sir Geoffrey Prior suggested. I submit a draft telegram accordingly, though I fear we may be too late as Major Hickinbotham is probably on the point of departure.mAFT TSLBGRAM Fran: Secretary of State To: Government of India, External Affairs Department Repeated to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Prior*s letter to you dated 13th February about Centre of Arab Studies in Middle East, There would seem much to be said for attempt to attract candidates from this Centre for Indian Political Service, If question is still open I suggest Hickinbotham might visit Jerusalem after (repeat after) his leave and should first discuss with us possibility of fitting such students into new I#C*S* recruitment scheme if it is extended to cover Political Service.

I was a little doubtful at the outset lest the Centre night not be organised on a very practical basis, and that the Services would be un willing to spare suitable en as candidates. In this connection I enclose a note by injor Uic cintothan, who . like myself wns son©what critical of the scheme at its outset, in which he makes it cleer that the scheme has proved a ^reat success, and is filling a very real ^eed. 2. At the preseht moment our cadre is practically bankrupt of officers of Arab experience and we have had to make do with a very limited number who acquire^ such knowledge as they can while doing a fill de/’e work at their political duties. It is clear that in the future we shall be completely outclassed unless we are prepared to give Gulf of leers better training, and I therefore re com'end that the Government of India .should oemit, lajor Hicklnbotham to proceed to Gerusaleu before the commence ent of his leave and se-* whether he can induce one or two of these young sen to throw in their lot with us on the completion of their course.

A. LANGUAGE. . jr— 1 . The object of the Centre is t*o teach Arabic as a language of modern intercourse. This object differentiates the Centre from the Faculties and Institutues in England v/hich teach Arabic primarily as a vehicle of classical literature. 2. Although modern literary Arabic is the lineal descendant of the classical literature, its application to modern needs has widened its range and transformed its character. The student of classical Arabic literature is familiar with a vocabulary and idiom dealing with religious experience, philosophic contemplation and mediaeval history. In the modern world he finds the language directed to problems of politics and economic, industry and science, journalism and social doctrine, Western literature and cflritical rationalism. The Vocabulary which expresses this widening range of experience has little more than a formal relationship with the vocabulary of classical vriters. 3. Literary Arabic modernised, extended and still in the thqres of adaptation, las the official and cultural instrument of modern life throughout the Arab world. It is expressed in a flourishing journalism, and in a vigorous popular literature, through which it conditions the mind of the modern Arab and determines his outlook and conduct. 4. Modern Arabic, the language of the newspapers, the public meeting, the Parliamentary debate, the diplomatic correspondence, the daily newspaper and broadcast is nowhere deliberately taught in England. The accurate observation of official life in these countries is only possible to those who learn Arabic in this modern spirit. Contact with litdrate Arabs- and it is they who will determine the Arab future - can hardly develop into a real intercourse except by a study of the medium in which Arab life is expressed today. A^ British representative can best observe and understand Arab life if he observes and understands what Arabs read, write and say to themselves and to the world at large. 5. The task then is severely practical - the acquisition of a living language as an aid to official and practical intercourse. It is process only feasible in the Environ ment in which the language liyes and in which it finds its daily expression. It is only th&amp;fe that the student can be in close touch with the language which he is trying to learn and can see how it is used. Many things happen to a language between the grammar book and the street. We are here concerned primarily with the stree^; the sound of the language, the idiom, the current cliche' are more vital than the grammatical theory. 6 . What is true of the language in its modern literary and official capacity applies ' a fortiori 1 ' to its spoken conversational forms. A student who has learnt the modern literary language in an environment where it is daily used will find the use of colloquial Arabic in various^countries a question of adaptation and modification, A man who is familiar with a standard form of modern English is not long baffled by the variations of Yorkshire, Somerset or Scotland.2 7. It is pertinent to ask whether this task of making modern Arab life linguistically accessible to an English man can be achieved or even approached within a year # It is ture that the Orientalist in England spends a far longer time before he considers himself to have achieved mastery. But the factors making for this protracted delay disappear when the scene is shifted from an English to an Arabic background and when the object of study is a set of modern living situations and not an obscure, unfamiliar mediaeval scene. What an Orientalist calls the difficulty of learning Arabic is only partially a matter of language. It is princi^/«Lly the difficulty of understanding a set of ideas and expressions far removed in time, space and mental horizon from any sefc of ideas with which he is already familiar. But to learn modern Arabic in an Arabic speaking country abolishes that remoteness. An Englishman who has learnt the structure and basic vocabulary of Arabic still requires years of training before he gets an insight into a line of Mutanabbi or a paragraph of Ghazali. He needs little except daily alertness to understand A1 Ahram, an official speech or broadcast, for these express aspects of life which are congenial to a modern mind and which lie within his daily observation. Onee the structure of the language has been carefully explained a year’s reading on the modern current themes with which a British representative would have to deal, can produce a satisfactory resu3it. The lectures syllabus no less than the modern language depends on a Middle Eastern environment. A small proportion of them chiefly history and Muslim theory, could conceivably be given with equal authority ^way from the Middle East. But these subjects are only Included at all for the light they throw on modern situations and movements, and these are to be described by men in close and actual contact with the aspects of modern life with which the Centre is concerned. The authority derived from actual or very recent experience can only be claimed by lecturers who come to the sutdents in the very midst of the problems about which they are to speak. Thus the affairs of each country will be described by men actually responsible for their administration or for the representation of their country's interest in them.CENTRE FOR ARAB ST UDIES IN MIDDLE EAST LECTURE SYLLABUS Attached le a list cf lectures which it is proposed to give at the Centre. It is a first draft and is subject to modifica- -tlon. Three or four evening lectures will be given each v/eek, the mornings being taken up with language teaching - and one outside lecturer will be brought in each week to give a talk on a key subject of which he has specialised knowledge. The list of lectures can conveniently be grouped under four headings: (a) The History 35 lectures (b) The modern politics and administrations .... 54 lectures (c) General and cultural subjects 46 lectures (d) Economics and Social Conditions o lectures By a rotation of lecture subjects, that is to say, taking a lecture from each group in turn, a variety of interest should be maintained.

The students, of whom there are twenty, are housed in the old city in fine premises designated the Austrian Hospice which still belong to an Austrian religious Order. It has not been found possible for every student to have a room to himself but so spacious is the accommodation that it is no hardship to share with another officer. The students mess together on the lower floor and have a common sitting room. Their hours of work are such that there is ample time for exercise and the week ends are at the s tudents 1 own disposal. 3. The students are from the Army and the Royal Air Force and have all of them seen considerable war service and have been selected by the Commanders-in-Chief concerned. They are all with one exception graduates of Oxford and Cambridge Universaties, the exception is I believe a graduate of Glasgow University. # There are several Oxford and Cambridge 'Blues” among tham and at least one musician of considerable ability. They vary in rank from senior Lieutenant to junior Lieutenant Colonel or Wing Commander but are all under the age of 30 and are most of them in their middle twenties. 4. The course lasts for one year during which time the student is required to attend lectures in Arabic totalling at least four hours a day. It is normal for the student to put in a further two hours a day*s study of the language during his spare time. An expert European instructor is resident and well qualified Arab teachers lecture daily. The Arabic course has been so arranged that At the end of twelve months I have no doubt that the students will be well grounded in classic*! Arabic, ( capable of reading with facility Arabic journals, and daily news* | papers, and fluent in conversation. At the f aa, 5 ***• poseiblj more interesting side of Arab studies has not been neglected \ /and.and lectures are delivered every week by experts on a variety of subjects ranging from 'A History of the Crusades' to 'Women’s place in Islamic Life'. The students are often required to write an essay some few days after having heard a lecture on a particular subject and the Director makes a point of dealing with each individual essay himself. 5. The High Commissioner in Palestine, the District Officers, Glubb Pasha of Trans-Jordan, and other experienced administrators and Arabists often ask students from the Course either to spend the week-end at their homes or to accompany them on a short tour. 9 Many of the lecture^ are the most expert that can be obtained on their particular subject and all of them are men of considerable experience of the Middle East and the ways of the inhabitants ; thereof. The Centre is particularly fortunate in having Colonel Bertram Thomas as its first Director for he is personally known to the vast majority of experts on Arabia and Arab affairs and can thus induce many shy officials to convey some portion of their knowledge to his students when they visit Jerusalem besides being able to persuade the busiest of officials to spare the time to deliver lectures. In addition of course, Colonel Bertram Thomas is a well known literary figure and an explorer of renown with a very sound knowledge of Arabic and a curious proficiency in a number of colloquial dialects. 6. The Centre is financed by the Foreign Office and the Army and although no specific promise is made to individual students it is more than probable that each officer who qualifies at the Centre will quickly find employment. I have been given to under stand that the Colonial Office have asked for five of the students every year. I think it would be admirable if one or two officers ! of the Indian Political Service could be sent on the Course each year. They would have an opportunity of learning a very important language and of acquiring a knowledge of tG* Middle East affairs which would be of the utmost value to them and to India.OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF STATE lO, SHARIA TOLUMBAT, CAIRO. Centre of Arab Studies On order to provide a body of young men with some knowledge of the Arabic language and an adequate background of Arabic, Islamic and Middle Eastern history, as well as of the problems with which H.M.G-overnment is faced now in the Middle East and which will become more acute in the future, a Centre of Arab Studies is to be set up in the Middle East. These officers, when trained, will constitute at the end of the war, or before, a Pool from which military, diplomatic and administrative demands for personnel may be met. Such demands may be expected from political missions, Intelligence organisations and Occupied Enemy Territory administration, while the existence of a number of officers with a first-hand knowledge of the Middle East and its problems can but be of general advantage. It is anticipated that the Centre will remain in existence for at least the duration of the war and should it be found to Justify its existence after the termination of hostilities,though this, of course, must depend upon future commitments in this part of the world and the general development of the situation. The need for officers with such a training has already been acutely felt in the past two years and it is not likely that this need will grow any less as the direct military control tends to relax. The officers to be selected to undergo training must be of a high standard and one of the advantages of carrying out their training in the Middle East is that in addition to the opportunities it offers for obtaining first-hand knowledge of the peoples with whom the students may ultimately deal, it also enables officers, who are either found unsuitable or themselves find that the atmosphere and the work is distasteful, to be eliminated before they are committed to any career. The scheme has the approval in principle of the Heads of all diplomatic missions concerned in the Middle East as well as of the High Commissioner Palestine and the Commander-in-Chief and has received the sanction of War Office, Foreign Office and Treasury.'7^ &lt;2;\i. u 5- i ■•&gt;€&gt;- j 5 [.'GO JNVVAJRD TELmPAM ! 1 Q 4 ° sscisr (If in any caso the comrrrjnication of the contents of th^docurrent to any poison outside government Service is authorised, it must bo paraphrased.)

It is proposed that the head of the centre should be Mr. Bertram Thomas, now Public Relations Officer in the Persian Gulf, who has obviously special qualifications for a post of this kind. Apparently he has already been approached in the matter for it is stated in paragraph 8 of the Minister of State’s note that he is enthusiastic about the scheme. Mr. Bertram Thomas has done useful work in Bahrein for the last two years and no doubt the Political Resident will be loth to lose his.services (see the papers flagged at Ext.5641, which show the very strong line taken by the Political Resident when there was a proposal to transfer Mr. Thomas to a post in Beirut in 1942). I think, however, that we may regard ourselves as fortunate to have kept Mr. Thomas for so long in a post which is not of the first importance, and it would be ungracious to stand in his way if he is anxious to take on this new work. On grounds of public interest also it could hardly be denied that Mr. Thomas is exceptionally well qualified for this appointment. In any case, we are not in a very strong position in the matter since Mr. Thomas is actually paid by the Ministry of Information, and if they are prepared to release him we should have to agree. A draft telegram consulting the Political Resident, with a lead in favour of letting Mr. Thomas go, is submitted.mr m but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,' Foreign Office, _ London, S.W.J. S.W.l London, S.W.J., IflDiXFO 17th September, 19 Sir I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a note by the Minister of State on the proposed formation of an Arab Centre in the Middle East in order to provide a body of young men with a knowledge of Arabic and Arab countries and of the problems which face His Majesty's Government in the Middle East. It will be seen that Mr. Casey wishes to appoint as head of the Centre Mr. Bertram Thomas, Director of the Public Relations Bureau at Bahrein, whose first-hand knowledge of all Arabic speaking countries makes him specially qualified for the post. It is proposed that Mr. Thomas shall receive the same salary as he does at Bahrein. 2. Mr. Eden shares Mr. Casey's view that there is at the present time a great need for officers with the training which this Centre would give them. He also considers that it would be very much in British interests that there should be an appreciable number of Arabic-speaking young British officers who would be possible candidates for post-war employment in Arab countries. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has now agreed to these proposals in principle, subject to the examination of details by the Foreign Office and the Treasury, and Mr. Casey is most anxious that Mr. Thomas should be released as soon as possible in order that detailed plans for the execution of this scheme may be worked out. In view of the importance of the task which Mr. Thomas would undertake, and of his exceptional qualifications for it, Mr. Eden very much hopes that Mr. Amery will agree that Mr. Thomas may be released to take up this appointment. 5./ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.r v ., I--, J Ji Copy. &lt;15 3074/506/65). OKCR S T ^ • ■ : UUDLi: hAOT Note by the Minister of state In order to provide l body or young men with some knowledge of the Arabic language and an adequate background of Arabic, Islamic and Middle Eastern history, as well as of the problems with which H.ii. Government is faced now in the Middle Kast and which will become more acute in the future, it is proposed to establish a Centre of Arab studies in a suitaole location in the Middle East. These officers, when trained, will constitute at t.,e end of the war, or before, a * J oul from which military, diplomatic and administrative uemands lor personnel may be met. 3 uch demands may be expected irom political missions, intelligence organisations, anu Occupied Itoeay Territory Administration, while the existence of a number of office rs with a first hand knowledge of the Middle East and its problems can be of general advantage. 2. It is anticipated that the Centre will remain in existence for at least the duration of the war and should it be found to justify its existence it seems quite conceivable that it might be advantageous to continue it after the termination of hostilities though this, of course, must depend upon future commitments in this part of the world and the general development of the situation. 3. The need for officers with such a training has already been acutely felt in the past two years and it is not likely that this need will grow any less as the direct military control tends to relax. 4. As a nucleus of students, it is proposed to draw on the pool of Political Officers set up in February 1^42 on the authority of Troopers telegram 66010 (SD2b) of 1 February 42. This authorised an establishment of twenty officers which has now been reduced to twelve. There would also be a certain number of students from O.S.T.A. and possibly from the British iCouncil, though the latter would presumably be a charge against iBritish Council funds. The total of students, however, should not exceed twenty. 5. The idea behind the formation of the political Ollicers pool was, in fact, the same as that inspiring the present scheme though the needs tobe met were more immediate. liow that the immediate threat appears to have been removed from Arabic countries the scheme can be envisaged on rather more thorough lines than were contemplated in 1^41. 6 . The officers to be selected to unaergo training must be of a high standard and one of the advantages of carrying out their training in the middle East is that in addition to the opportunities it offers to obtaining lirst hand knowledge of the peoples with whom the students may ultimately deal, it a^so enables officers, who are either found unsuitable or tnemselves find that the atmosphere and the work is distasteful, to be eliminated before they are committed to any career. 7. It is suggested that the students would, at the outset, be attached to the Centre for a period of six months to learn Arabic ana attend lectures on geography, history, religion, culture, and politics of the Middle Fast as a whole, as well as on such administrative questions as arc likely to oe mat with by them in the future. At the end of six months the students/X be students would be attached for a period to diplomatic or political organisations in the Middle Kast, returning thereafter to the Centre to resume their language studies and, perhaps, specialise on the problems of some one country. It is hoped, therefore, to produce some fifteen to twenty officers per year with at least a working knowledge both of the language and the general conditions of the Arabic speaking countries in the Middle East. 7 8 . The choice of the Head of the Centre is of importance and it is proposed to appoint, with local rank or Colonel, r * ^ local Lieut. Colonel) Bertram Thomas, subject to the consent of the Government of India and Ministry of Information. Mr. Thomas, in addition to being a notable expert on Arab affairs, has a first hand knowledge of ail the Arabic speaking countries in the Middle T Cast and, in aduition, the necessary academic background. He is enthusiastic about the scheme, a most essential point, and his name ana reputation should enable him to exercise that influence on students which will be necessary 9. A small staff will be required consisting as far as Can b forecast at the moment of an Assistant, three Instructors in Arabic, Bursar, clerks, servants, etc. It has not been possible so far to prepare a detailed budget with any accuracy, but two approximate estimates are attached to this note at Appendix ’’A”. The first of these is based on the assumption that it is possible and advisable for the students- to live out with Arabic speaking families* The second.on the assumption that they will live in a central hostel. The figures quoted are liable to considerable correction, either up or down. It will be seen that in the first estimate the cost of the first year will be in the neighbourhood of £10,600 and in the second estimate £14,700. 10. The location of the Centre is yet to be uecided. The ideal place would undoubtedly be either Damascus or Beirut, but it is realised that objections on the part of the French may make this out of the question. The possibility is, nevertheless, being explored. Failing one of these two places the most suitable location will probably be in Palestine. 11 . T consider the scheme of great value; it has tne approval in principle of the Heads of all Diplomatic Missions concerned in the Middle ;.ast as well as of the High Commissioner Palestine and the Commander-in-Chief, and I would be grateful if very early approval may be &amp;iven to proceed with the scheaie on the above lines. finitialled).
