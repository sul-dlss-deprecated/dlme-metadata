The enclosure is a report which states that the Sultan of Muscat has received a proposal from Mahammed and Ali bin Khuleefa [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah, ‘Alī bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah] of Bahrain, of a treaty between Bahrain and Muscat, in which the friends of one would be the friends of another, and the enemies of one the enemies of the other. Hamerton reports that he has dissuaded the Imam, Sa‘id bin Sulṭān al-Sa‘id, from agreeing to the proposal for now, the Sultan consenting to his suggestion on the basis that he soon departs for Zanzibar for several months.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673703.0x00001e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
