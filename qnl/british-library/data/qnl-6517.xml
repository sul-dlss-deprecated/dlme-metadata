These questions have been revived at a conference recently held at the Foreign Office. At the instance of the Prime Minister it was decided that the Secretary of State should consult the Viceroy privately on the advisability of the Imperial Government taking Aden, the Somali Coast and eveiything connected with the Red Sea off the hands of the Government of India j in which case, Lord Salisbury would w T ish to leave the direction of our relations with Persia as far as possible with India. The Secretary of State has ac cordingly placed the suggestion before the Viceroy and invited an expression of his views. ADEN. 1 Jn regard to the transfer of Aden, the Somali Coast and everything connected with the Red Sea to the Imperial Government, it appears that a similar suggestion was made in 1874. In paragraphs 3-17 of his despatch, No. 22, dated the 7th August 1874, the Secretary of State (Marquis of Salisbury) addressed the Viceroy (Lord Northbrook) as follows:— 3. “ The transfer of India to the Crown, the increas ed facility of intercourse between Europe and Asia caused by the opening of the Suez Canal, the great develop ment of the telegraph and postal communication be tween the West and the East, the growing desire of many of the great European Powers to establish oriental relations, the intricate questiona connected with the slave-trade, and other causes, have all tended to produce a perceptible change in the relative position of the Imperial and Indian Governments as regards their external policy in the East, and appear to call for some revision and re-distribution both of their political and financial responsibilities with a view to their better adaptation to existing circumstances. 4. “ In this view I am desirous of submitting to Her Majesty’s Imperial Government certain definite pro posals, on which I should be glad, in the first instance, to receive an expression of Your Excellency s opinion, having for their object, on the one hand, the tiansfer of the control and charges of Aden, and the part pay ment now made by the Indian Exchequer towards the expenses of our relations with Zanzibar, as well as towards Consulates in China, to the Imperial Exchequer, and on the other, the assumption by India of the charge and primary direction of our reations with SianT, and of Indian relations with Persia.[ 2 ] 5. “ I proceed to lay before Your Excellency the reasons which appear to recommend this change, refer ring in the first instance to Aden and Zanzibar. 6. “ Your Excellency is well aware that when Aden came into our possession in 1838 it was a decayed settlement of comparatively small importance. 7. “With the Red Sea closed in great part to the ships of rival European Powers, neither able nor desir ous of disputing our supremacy, or questioning our rights, Aden was justly considered a place more of Indian than European interest, and was retained under the administrative and financial control of Bombay. 8. “ The progress of events, however, culminating in the opening of the Suez Canal, have gradually effected a marked change, especially apparent at the present time, in the military, political, and commercial value to Great Britain of our position at Aden. 9. “On the one hand the Red Sea is open by easy access to the fleets of rival Powers, whilst on the other. Allies hitherto most friendly are questioning British rights at Aden and on the coast of Africa. 10. “We are thus involved in diplomatic action in which India has no direct voice, and over which she has no practical control. 11. “In short the occupation of Aden derives its principal importance no longer from considerations of Indian interests, but from its relation to the general foreign policy of the Empire in which it holds a position analogous to that of Malta and Gibraltar. 12. “Whilst the importance of Aden has thus increased in a political sense, the necessities of trade have rendered that settlement still more valuable in a commercial point of view. 13. “ It has become, since the opening of the Suez Canal, the key of the commercial highway to the East, the coaling station and rendezvous of hundreds of mer chant vessels of all nations trading between Europe and America on the one side, and India, China, Japan, Australia, and the Islands of the Eastern Seas on the other, rendering it a position in the maintenance of which the whole commercial world is vitally interested. 14. “ Your Excellency will doubtless call to mind that so far back as 1861 Lord Canning's Government raised the question of relieving Indian revenue, either partially or in entirety, from the charge of Aden, and the police of the Red Sea. 15. “ Subsequent events have tended to strengthen the conviction which seems to have acted on Lord Canning's mind of the wisdom of abandoning a divided and anomalous responsibility, more Imperial than Indian, which not only entails a heavy charge on Indian revenue, but obliges the Government of India to deal with remote questions, such as Turkish claims to Yemen, over which it has no actual control. 16. “Should Aden be transferred to Imperial charge under the administration .of the Colonial Office, opportu nity might be taken to raise the status of the Resident to that of a Governor of high rank and oriental ex perience, who, assisted by a competent administrative staff, should have the entire control of British relations, whether political or connected with the slave-trade, from Suez to the Muscat frontier, including Zanzibar, Perim, and the northern coast of Africa. 17. “ As a matter of cost Aden appears to entail a charge of nearly £100,000 per annum on Indian revenue. Your Excellency will doubtless be able tqobtain and furnish confidentially a detailed statement on this point, together with the estimated value of ex isting or projected works, fortifications, and plant, in addition to any other information which you may deem essential to the elucidation of this question. I enclose copy of a preliminary correspondence ou the subject of the transfer of Aden which has passed between the Foreign and India Office.” To this despatch the following’ reply was, after discussion in Council, sent by the Govern ment of India in their despatch No. 163, dated the 16th August 1875 :— 2. “ With reference to the question of the transfer of the control and charges of Aden from the Indian to the Imperial Government, we fully concur in the views Your Lordship has expressed relative to the great increase in the importance of that settlement which has been effected of late years through the opening of the Suez Canal, the development of telegraphic and postal communication between the West and the East, and other circumstances which have arisen from the rapid progress of events. Both from a political and a com mercial point of view, the maintenance of our position at Aden is of far more importance to the British Empire than it was a few years ago. But we are not therefore convinced that British interests wmuld be better served by transferring the control of its internal administration and external relations from the Indian to the Home Government. 3. “In the first place, although it doubtless holds in some respects a position analogous to that of Malta or Gibraltar, its geographical position must be considered. If the fortress w r ere menaced by a hostile power, India would have to furnish succour; and if communication through the Suez Canal happened to be cut off, Aden would almost naturally fall under the control and direction of the Indian Government, however much the place might previously have been removed from such control. 4. “Under any circumstances the native portion of the garrison of Aden must be furnished from India and be under Indian rules; and it would be very difficult to pay any portion of the troops (even those of the British army) otherwise than on the Indian scale. The Royal Artillery would probably continue, as at present, to be detached from a Brigade in the Bombay Presidency, while the convenience of making Aden a stepping stone on the road home for British regiments is so obvious, that it is not likely the present practice of dropping a relieved regiment on its way to England for a year will be relinquished. These circumstances would serve to maintain a considerable amount of con nexion between Aden and India; and, do what we might, the troops and establishments at Aden would be on much the same footing under the Imperial as under the Indian Government, except that they would be under a controlling power more distant and less suited to deal with such conditions than the present one. 5. “ In the next place we think the question of internal administration has been somewhat overlooked in the proposal. Aden is practically an Indian town ; with the exception of the Arabs and Somalees who visit the place on business of a temporary nature, the population is wholly Indian, or is engaged in Indian trade; the capital invested in the place is Indian; the[ 4 ] laws and mode of government are Indian, and the officers whose duty it has hitherto been to administer them have been selected from the Indian service. We apprehend that if the transfer were effected difficulties might arise with regard to the internal goverumeut of the place which it is not now easy to foresee; and that so long as the place is held to be an integral part of the Indian Empire, and subject to the same system of legislation as is in force elsewhere, these difficulties would not present themselves. 6. For these and other reasons we consider the pro posal to transfer the control of Aden to the Home Government to be of doubtful expediency. Nor do we consider the external relations of the place to be of such a nature as to call for a change. Whether Aden were under the control of the India or the Colonial Office, questions of foreign policy affecting European powers must necessarily be referred to the Foreign Office. It is doubtful whether the settlement of these diplomatic questions would be facilitated by the transfer; and the Indian Government, which is directly or in directly interested in all questions relating to the East, might be trusted for bringing to notice matters that required settlement, and for stating the case in a manner conducive to British interests. But should circum stances hereafter require that the authorities at Aden should be brought into closer communication with the Foreign Office, we think the preferable alternative would be to adopt the course suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and while retaining in our own hands the control of the internal and military adminis tration of Aden, and the political relations with the independent tribes adjacent to the settlement, to permit the Resident to be invested with the functions of a Consul-General for those Provinces of Turkish Arabia which are in contiguity to Aden. 2. No definite reply to the arguments of the Government of India on this parti cular point seems to have been received. Tho arguments in favour of retaining control over Aden and its dependencies still hold good. It must also be remembered that there are now protectorate treaties between the Govern ment of India and the tribes round Aden, covering the whole Coast of Hadramaut from the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb to Oman. Perim must be treated for the purposes of the present reference as a part of Aden. SOMALI COAST. It is sufficient for the present purpose to note that the first intimation received from England that Egypt .was likely to abandon Harrar and the whole Somali Coast was in the telegram of the 9th May 1S84. Between that date and October 1884, the control of the mea sures taken by Major Hunter for facilitating the arrangements for the evacuation, and for concluding agreements with the local tribes rested partly with the Indian and partly with the Home Government. f[ 5 ] On the 3 6th October 1884, Sir E. Baring wrote to Lord Granville as follows :— “ I venture to submit to Your Lordship that at present there is danger of co ,, f”- 2 ion.. l /i'y’naf to the mingled conUoi over these questions of the Indian Gov ernment and of Your Lordship through myself, and to suggest that it might be advisable to place the whole control over all questions connected with the adminis tration of that coast, and with negotiations, &amp;c., with the Somali tribes in the hands of the Indian Govern ment, and I have the honour to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to instruct me whether I may answer Major Hunter in that sense. Major Hunter would, of course, continue for the present to correspond direct with me upon all matters connected with the withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons and civil employes.” The result of this reference was that the Secretary of State telegraphed to Lord Bipon on the 7th November 1884 as follows:— “ Somali Coast. Baring suggests that, to avoid confusion, control should be in your hand. I propose to agree now as regards Coast Hafun to Zaila, and when evacuation of Harrar is completed to include Zaila itself subject to relinquishment, if Sultan accept our conditions. Foreign Office to manage affairs on Coast Zaila to Babel Mandeb and Harrar. Do you concur ?” The reply was sent on the 8th Novem ber— “ Somali Coast. Council has dispersed for autumn tours, and I can only give my personal opinion, which is that Government of India should have nothing to do with management of affairs on the Somali Coast or with expenditure incurred there.” The India Office Memorandum states “ this reply was received w r ith surprise, the “ action taken in the matter having been based “ on the absolute necessity of securing supplies “ for Aden, and in conformity with views ex- “ pressed in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 10th “ May.” The question was allowed to remain in abeyance until the 25th December when the following telegram was sent to Lord Dufferin w r ho had in the meantime assumed the Viceroyalty— “ I propose now with your concurrence to proceed with arrangements in accordance with my telegram of November 7th to late Viceroy. Our protectorate over Somali Coast Is essential for Aden, in conjunction with which it should be managed by Indian Govern ment. Have you any observation to offer?” The matter w r as discussed in Council with the result that we telegraphed on the 14th January 1885— “Your telegrams dated 7th November and 25th December. IVe agree to proposal that control of Somali Coast from Hafun to Zaila, inclusive, should be in our hands for the present, subject to understand ing that expenses hitherto incurred by us on account of Egyptian evacuation shall be refunded, and that if hereafter cost of administration should exceed receipts, Indian revenues willl be relieved of all charge.”I 6 ] The Secretary of State replied on the 21st January— Yours 14th. “ Somali Coast. Already settled Egypt defrays '’•‘U’sele^s to propose secretly second condition to Foreign Otfice. Treasury would certainly object, occupation being in Aden interest. Would also involve continued dual control, very inconvenient. I would therefore ask you to re-consider this condition so as to enable me to arrange on basis of mine, 7th November.” To this Lord Lufferin answered privately on the 22nd January that, though unwilling to admit that the conditions insisted upon in the telegram of the 14th January were not justi fied, yet, if it w r as considered useless to press them on the Foreign Office, the Government of India assented unconditionahly to the arrangement originally proposed. On the 25th February we addressed the Bombay Govern ment as follows— w I am directed to address you in continuation of my telegram No. 234-E., dated the 17th instant,, regarding the affairs of the Somali Coast. 2. “ The Governor in Council was informed by that telegram that the Government of India had accepted the control of the Somali Cost from Has Hafuu to Zaila, and it was requested that the primary super vision of this coast might be undertaken by the Gov ernment of Bombay, references on important matters being made to the Governor-General in Council. I am now to observe that the Consul for the Somali Coast and his Assistants are directly subordinate to the Indian Government in respect of the coast between Has Hafun and Zaila, and it is desirable that their position should be properly understood. The Govern- nor-General in Council is prepared to leave ample discretion in the hands of the Government of Bombay for the management of this coast, but inasmuch as it is impossible at present to foresee the character of the difficulties and complications which may arise, it is essential that all matters of importance should be promptly reported for the information of.the Govern ment of India ; and particular care should be exercised to prevent any action by the local officers which might unnecessarily increase British responsibilities oi lead to entanglements with the neighbouring tribes. In the financial administration it is hoped that local receipts will eventually cover the full cost of local administration, including provision for the liabilities of Government for pensions and leave allowances. The Governor-General in Gouncil is awaie that accurate estimates cannot at once be formed, but no time should bo lost in placing the collection of revenues aud the expenditure under such rules as may now be experi mentally applied. S. “The primary objects of Government are to secure for Aden a supply market, to check the traffic in slaves, and to exclude the interference of foreign powers. It is consistent with these objects, and with the protectorate which the Indian Government has assumed to interfere as little as possible with the customs of the people, and to leave them to administer their own internal affairs. In this view, I am to request that the Agent may be directed to furnish a full report regarding the population of Berbera, the sys tem of administering justice, if any, and other matters oft » ] interest. It may perhaps be convenient that the Agents designation should be changed to correspond with hia new position, and on this, and any other details the Gov- ment of India will await an expression of the opinion of the Governor of Bombay in Council. 4. “ In regard to Zaila, further instructions will be issued when the evacuation of Harrar is complete, and when the intentions of the Ottoman Porte relative to a resumption of its sovereign rights shall have been assertained. At present, the responsibility for the management of affairs at Zaila, and from Zaila to the Bab-el-Mandeb Straits and to Harrar rests with Her Majesty’s Government.” On the 25th June 1885 Sir E. Baring tele graphed that the evacuation of Harrar was complete, so from that date the control over Zaila itself came into the hands of the Indian Government. On the 14th January 1886 the Secretary of State telegraphed— Egyptian Government has reluctantly paid deficit of 400 pounds sterling on administration up to October last. Understood here that all expenses connected with Harrar evacuation, including cost of Zaila administra tion, is debitable to Egypt up to the date of the final evacuation in June 1885; but that from that date India assumes financial responsibility for Zaila till final decision as to its retention or otherwise. I propose, with your concurrence, to say this to the Foreign Office. Telegraph your views.” And on the 24th January the Viceroy replied— “ I agree.” 6. It may he as well here to notice that our actual protectorate extends from a short distance to the east of Has Jibuti to Bunder Ziadeh, and that the Germans have endea voured to obtain a footing in the territory between Bunder Ziadeh and Has Uafun, and apparently with the approval of Her Ma jesty’s Government, but so far the attempts have not been successful. 6. Regarding Harrar it is sufficient to remark that by the 4th article of the Anglo- Erench agreement— “The two Governments engage not to endeavour to annex Harrar, nor to place it under their protectorate. In taking this engagement the two Governments do not renounce the right of opposing attempts by any other power to acquire or assert rights over Harrar.” In this connection we have recently had an intimation that Italy assumes that the British Protectorate on the Somali Coast is confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the ports actually in British occupation; and it has been suggested that an attempt should be made to indicate the approximate limits of British authority inland. A reply has just been received from the Bombay Government which shows that it would be impossible in our present knowledge of the country to fix any such limits.[ 8 ] 7. It appears that the chief raison d etre of our control over the Somali Coast, so far as India is concerned, is to provide Aden with its meat supply and also with camel transport if necessary. If Aden remains under the Gov ernment of India, there would perhaps he not very strong objection to the transfer of the Somali Coast to the Home Government as long as we could rest tolerably assured that under no circumstances would the ports of Bulbar and Berbera he transferred to a foreign power. On the other hand India is more likely to have a consistent policy on that coast; there seems every prospect of our Protectorate paying its v T ay in course of time; and, if we were more active in securing trade routes and pushing our influence into the interior, we should not improbably find that the coast would produce a surplus. Experience has shown that, notwithstanding the efforts of the French, Jibuti is not likely to pay its way or to seriously affect the trade of Zaila. That Zaila is hankered after by the French and Italians is not improbable, and if the result of handing over the Somali Coast to the Home Government is to run the risk of losing Zaila, and allowing it to fall into the hands of a foreign Power, it would he better to leave things as they are. It seems perhaps rather absurd to a casual observer that this small stretch of territory on the African coast should he under the control of the Indian Govern ment when such an infinitely larger stretch of the same coast is under the Home Government; but on the other hand, when it is considered that Socotra and the whole of the Arabian coast on the opposite shore of the Gulf of Aden, are under our protectorate, it seems fit and natural that the influence of the Government of India should be extended to the Somali Coast as well. RED SEA. 8. The only connection that the Govern ment of India has in this direction is with the Consulate at Jeddah and the Vice-Consulate at Hodeida and Kamaran. In the former case the Consul belongs to the English Consular service and India pays half the charges. In the latter case the Vice-Consul is nominated by India, and the expense is borne jointly by the Imperial and Indian Governments. F. D. Presa-No. 217—12.6.90—54.SUMMARY. Aden. With regard to Aden. Although it is of much importance as an imperial coaling sta tion, it is of even more vital consequence to India. It must always he held partly, at all events, by Indian troops; and in view of the indifference which recurrently creeps over the British public, and the great difficulty of obtaining money from Parliament for defences, there is strong reason to believe that India will always have a more direct interest in maintaining the efficiency of its garrison and armament than England. In the event of transfer, it is not probable that England would accept the burden of expenditure at Aden and its dependencies, and if India is to pay, there seems no reason why she should not continue to control. If the Indian Government hands over Aden and the Somali Coast to the Imperial Government, there would be a greater risk than there now is of their fate being made dependent upon the transitory requirements of home and European politics. Somali Coast. Within the last few years, there has been a growing interest manifested by Italy, Ger many and France, in the Somali Coast and the adjacent portions of Africa. The Egyptian garrisons of Ilarrar, Zaila, Berbera, and Bulhar were finally withdrawn in 1881-85. We then occupied these places, but subsequently left Harrar to take care of itself, and did not inter fere when it fell into the hands of Shoa and subsequently became a portion of the Italian protectorate. Italy. Italy is now r firmly established in Assab Bay on the Eanakil Coast, and at Massowah, and she has obtained by treaty a certain right of protectorate and exclusive control over what she designates as Ethiopia (which practi cally means Abyssinia, Shoa, and Harrar), through engagements made with the ruler of Shoa before he succeeded to the Abyssinian throne, or occupied Harrar. Italy is aggressively active in this region, and, notwithstanding our very friendly attitude to her, has given rise for suspicion and re monstrance in the direction of Souakin, lokar, and Kassala; and is supposed to harbour a design to obtain a footing on the Upper Nile. She is stretching inland from Massowah as far as she can, and will there have healthy highlands, in which Europeans can live. At Assab she is hemmed in by the ferocious Danakils, who as yet have had the best of itt 2 1 in encounters which have taken place. Shoa and Harrar are dependent on the English and Erench ports for their trade, Zaila being far the most important in that respect, while our other occupied points—Berbera and Buihar concern us more as sources of supply for Aden. Italy has not yet asked for Zaila, hut there can be little doubt that she hankers after it, and that she would endeavour to obtain it in any future transaction in which we had to find a quid pro quo. Brom a trading point of view, it was a mistake to allow Brance to get a footing in the Bay of Tajoura, and it would be equally a mistake to give up Zaila to Italy, and still more Berbera and Buihar, as we should, sooner or later, have a hostile tariff in restriction of trade, as in the case of Batoum. Italy has already displayed the cloven hoof in reference to remonstrances as to alleged encroachments by us in the direction ^ of Harrar; and by claiming to include a portion of the Khor Baraka, between Tokar and Kassala, within her sphere of influence. Prance, having formerly but a nominal establishment at Obok, has now a port or landing place near Has Jibuti, from which a certain portion of the trade with the inteii- or, by caravan, to Harrar, has supplanted a portion of that which formerly passed exclu sively through Zaila. Our unfortunate proximity with Prance at this point, combined with her practice of giving protection to any one who asks for it, has already occasioned annoyance in respect to jurisdiction at Zaila. Were it not for our complaisance towards Prance, our joint renunciation of Harrar, and our tacit acquiescence in the spread of Italian influence thither, the Somali Coast would, in all probability, have been more tran quil and more prosperous. As the pretensions of Germany to the coast from Bunder Zaideh to Has Haiun ha\e apparently been allowed to drop, it is only necessary to indicate that this region includes Cape Guardafui upon which a lighthouse will sooner or later be erected, and it may be come desirable again to include it within the sphere of British influence. It is in short advisable that no other nation should be allowed to obtain any fur ther foothold upon the shores of the Gulf of Aden, which may he taken as extending from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to Oman on the north and Socotra on the south. As regards leaving Persia to India, this proposal implies that the British Minister in Prance. Germany. Persia.[ 3 ] Tehran should owe allegiance to the Viceroy and not to the British Foreign Office. That India is deeply interested in Persia is undeni able, but her interests, when they arise, will be better served by an Imperial Minister with the whole authority of England at his hack, than by the delegate of a Viceroy whose policy is subordinate to the Secretary of State for India. It would be impossible to assure the same political status to an Indian Resident in his relations with the regular diplomatic officials of other Powers, as that held by a direct representative of the Queen ; and even if the fiction were maintained, the Shah and the Corps Diplomatique would he sure to resent the subordination of the British Min ister to the Viceroy. Russia would, more over, play off the Government of India and the London Foreign Office against each other. India would he brought face to face with Russia without any direct power of exercising influence or putting pressure upon her; and without that intimate acquaintance with the ever-fluctuating secret relations of the Great Powers which must necessarily be centered in the Foreign Minister. No friction or practical inconvenience arises at present from maintaining in Persia and in the adjacent portions of the Ottoman Empire, officials who own a dual allegiance. Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran keeps the Viceroy fully informed of the course of events. The majority of questions, which arise, involve not Indian interests alone but those of the Emjoire, and but few cases occur upon which an answer or decision could be given upon an important point by the Viceroy, without re ference to the Home Government. The office of Oriental Secretary to the Tehran Legation has recently been created, and is held by an Indian officer, w r hose views upon Indian inter ests are at the disposal of the Minister. Indian Officers represent both the Minister and the Viceroy at Meshed and on the Persian Gulf. The existing system, though it may have anomalies, has w T orked w r ell in practice, and it does not appear desirable to make any radical change. Foreign Office Press—No. 2 \ 7 \ —12-6-20—54.TRANSFER OF THE PERSIAN LEGATION TO INDIA. In 1872, the question was raised by Mr. East wick, and after being discussed by Sir H. Rawlinson, and others at the India Office, and by the Viceroy and bis Council in India, was made the subject of the following remarks in a despatch to the Secretary of State for India, dated 19th January 1872. They are based upon the note recorded by Lord Mayo, who was at that time Viceroy:— “ Ou the subject of the transfer of the Persian Mission to the control of the Indian Government, we concur with Sir Henry Rawlinson as to the absolute necessity of an immediate change in the relations of the Indian Government with the British Mission at Tehran. We heartily subscribe to every word he says as to the good influence which an able and energetic Anglo-Indian Statesman would exercise over the mind of the present Sovereign of Persia. The Indian Go vernment could always supply an Officer well fitted for the responsible and important duties which he would have to perform, and seeing (as we do repeatedly) the enormous influence that a straightforward, courte ous, able, and accomplished English gentleman can obtain in very little time over the minds of Asiatic Rulers, we cannot but believe that the recommendation which has been repeatedly made by the present Indian Government would, if carried out, be met with certain and immediate success. We are not blind to the fact that Russia does exercise considerable influence at Persia. The Oriental character of her diplomacy ena bles her to employ means and influences which probably are beyond our reach. But we !&gt;elieve this can only be met, and a counter influence obtained, by the em ployment of able and experienced agents, men who have spent their lives in studying Oriental character, and who will represent their Sovereign more as the Ruler of Hindoostan than as a European Potentate/* Almost immediately afterwards (on 19th April 1872), the Government of India reiter ated these views in a despatch to the Duke of Argyll. But three years later they modified them very considerably, as the following extract No. 226 of Political A., Sept. flOm their despat 'll 1875, No„ 212-226. No. 163, dated 16til August 1875, will show :— “ We are generally of opinion that it would be inexpedient to disturb the relations that now exist between the Mission and the Foreign Office. The officers who represent foreign interests at the Court of Tehran are members of the regular diplomatic service of their respective countries, and if a different practice were followed in the case of the representative of Great Britain, it is doubtful whether he would not lose in influence and prestige with the Court to which he is accredited, and with I is diplomatic colleagues. There are also few important steps which could be taken with respect to Persia and the countries adjoining it, which would not ultimately demand a reference to the Foreign Office; while the progress of events in Persia and the evident wish which the Shah has displayed to be included within the circle of European Powers, afford•&gt;» [ 2 j some grounds for thinking that the purely Eastern methods of diplomacy which have been so ably advo cated by Sir Henry Rawlinson may, in the course of years, become less adapted to the requirements of the Persian Court than in former days. But we con sider nevertheless that the interests of India should be represented at Tehran &gt; and we are therefore prepared, in modification of the views expressed in the despatch of the Government of India, No. Zff, dated the 19th April 1872, to suggest that a Secretary of Legation and a Military Attach^ should be appointed by the Government of India. The Secretary of Legation, while subordinate to Her Majesty’s Minister, would be in possession of the views of this Government on questions affecting Indian interests, and would be recognized as the adviser of the Minister on such matters.” Again, about a year later (25th May 18/6), Lord Lytton’s Government confirmed these modified views and wrote to the Secretaiy of State :— “ The representation of specially Indian interests has, for many years, been so neglected, or at least so unsuccessfully maintained, at the Court of Tehran, and the influence of Russia at that Court has, during the same period, so greatly increased, and so firmly estab lished itself, that it would now be difficult to re-consti- tute Persia into a really effectual bulwark to this Empire, without an expenditure largely exceeding any which the Indian revenues are at present able to afford. For this reason, and also because, in consequence of the above-mentioned fact, the character of diplomatic rela tions with Persia must now be determined by consider ations subject to the general foreign policy of Her Majesty’s Government, we think that the time is past when the entire establishment, and direct management, of the British Mission at Tehran could be advanta geously undertaken by the Government of India. “ There are still, however, so many important questions in connection with which the interests of India may be advantageously, or injuriously, affected by the conduct of the Persian Government, that we deem it extremely desirable that some officer thoroughly con versant with those interests (political and commercial, as well as military) should be on the permanent staff of Her Majesty’s Legation in Persia.” It need only be added that a year ago the office of Oriental Secretary to Her Majesty’s Legation at Tehran was created. The post is held by an Indian Officer, and the intention is believed to be always to appoint an Indian Officer, so that although the creation of the post was suggested by the Minister and for the benefit of the Legation, the incumbent may in many informal ways be able to represent Indian view s, and benefit Indian interests.
