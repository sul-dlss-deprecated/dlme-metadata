Muna (Mina) is a station of the hadj, where pilgrims camp out on the 8th, 11th, 12th (and some on the 13th) of
                           Dhul-Hijjah, as can be seen in this image.Right of centre, along the horizon, eight arches are set into a pale-coloured building. Otherwise no other permanent structures are evident, however, the rest of the flat plain that takes up the middle ground is dotted with many and varying tents, people, beasts of burden, such as horses, camels and donkeys. Small flocks of sheep or goats are visible in the foreground to the right of centre.A ridge of hills rises along the horizon, with the highest point to the right of centre.Arabic script written directly into the image has been erased subtly, but is visible upon close inspection in the lower left of the image as well as in the central sky area of the image.This is the second of two photographs taken from the same vantage point, which form a panoramic view over the valley. The first is X463/11.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘XI’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
