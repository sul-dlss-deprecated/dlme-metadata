Piease see Ivir.Abell’s telegram to Sir S.Jenkins below in which it is stated that, at the invitation^of* the Governor of Ceylon, Sir O.Caroe wishes to pay nim a visit in order to discuss general questions of foreign relations, defence, etc. The Colonial Office were asked whether they saw any objection to the proposed visit and their reply, which is immediately below, places a completely different complexion on the proposal. In the circumstances, it seems that we have no alternative but to reply in the sense of l&gt;lr, Sidebotham’s letter, i.e., that the Governor, who has been consulted, states that he is not in a position to issue a private invitation since he does not know Sir O.Caroe and that, therefore, it is presumed that an official visit is in contemplation. But the Colonial Office do not favour an official visit at the present time since it^migjxt create awkward political repercussions.

Caroe’s proposed visit to Ceylon, the G-overnor has now telegraphed saying that he has not issued any invitation to Sir 0. Caroe and cannot issue him a private invitation as he does not know him. The Governor reports that what happened was that Sir 0. Caroe indicated to Colonel Johnson, a friend of his on.the C.-in-C.’s staff, that he would welcome an opportunity of sending a member of his staff - somebody of the name of Wint was suggested - on an unofficial visit to Ceylon as the External Affairs Department were anxious to obtain much more information about Ceylon affairs than they have at present. Colonel Johnson was authorised to reply that such an unofficial visit would be welcome, but nothing more had been heard of the suggestion until our telegram to the Governor arrived. The Governor went on to say that while he would naturally like to discuss questions with Sir 0. Caroe informally if he so wishes it, for the reasons explained above he cannot issue a private invitation to him to come to Ceylon, and he takes the view which we share that any official visit would require careful consideration at the present time, in view of possible political repercussions.,w\ ifcy, 154-5 Irigne d iate Dear Sidebotham, / As arraj^jed by telep/ioae, I er elose a copy of a draft telegx-air waich we propose, subject to year concunei.ee, to send to the Private Secretary to the acting LrOveraor-'^k leral. 7^ If you t’uink tliat the jc iticsJL rep# rex. sions^which ^ fear^ would be avoided if the visit were xade udl st the guise of a visit to S.S.A.CJd, ./e might put this suggestion to India in the: telegram* Yours sincerely.

He will finish his work here on November 21st and can leave any time after that. Lord Wavell is anxious that he should return to India as soon as possible after the expiry of his deputation and has stipulated for his arrival by the first week in December. Mr. Caroe has applied for an extra allotment of baggage (up to a maximum of 80 lbs. altogether) on the ground that he has had to buy replacements here of clothes which are necessary for his diplomatic duties in India but cannot be replaced there. May this be granted in principle, the ^ amount to be fixed later?DrciTt telegram sanctioning.The Government of Indians proposal that Mr. Garoe should spend three months in this country on deputation was approved in July (see minutes on Ext. 3896/43). Mr. Garoe left'India on the 8th August, arriving here on the 19 th August. He has since has to undergo a minor operation which has set his health hack considerably. Both the Viceroy and Lord Wavell agree that it would be advisable for his period of deputation to be extended for a further ironth to enable him to return to India really recovered in health. Formal sanction is therefore sou^it for the extension of the deputation by a month. Mr* Garoe would leave the U.K. towards the end of November, reaching India in early December.

This was approved. Owing to the illness of Mr. Yfeightman, however, Mr. Caroe*s departure from India was delayed till the 8th August. Recently he has had to undergo a minor operation • for antrum and teeth trouble which has pulled him down considerably. It is obviously important that he should be really fit again before he returns to take up work under the new Viceroy and it is therefore proposed that he should be granted a month*s extension of his deputation. This would enable him to stay in this country until towards the end of November, arriving back in India early in December. I have spoken to Mr. Jenkins who has ascertained that Lord Javell has no objections and it is known from personal correspondence that there will be no objection from the Indian end. Perhaps we might obtain the Viceroy*s concurrence in the first place and a draft telegram is submitted accordingly.
