Wh n the man arrived at Ras al Khaimah, the Shaikh was in Dubai and had to return with a certficate from Shaikh Humaid so as to avoid delay. When the Shaikh returned to Ras al Khaimah he worte me that the man returned to Tunb before his arrival but that he had sent for him again.

I showed the Shai :h the certficate received with your memorandum in which the name is given as Hasan bin Ibrahim and askedjhim which is correct.

I have now learnt that over 3000 persons including women and children have recently sailed for the Trucial Coast from Jask alone. 3. Although a certain amount of extra labour is welcome for the work on the Sharjah and Dubai aerodromes a large scale immigration of this sort is hound to give rise to serious problems if it continues for any length of time. 4. Persian immigration is already strictly controlled at Bahrain and it is for consideration whether the Trucial Coast Bulers should not be advised to adopt some similar measure.

Before leaving Sharjah I asked Khan Sahib Abdul Raxzak to let me have fuller information about the immigra tion of Persians to the Trucial Coast. I have not yet received a report from him, but your confirmation of what he told us verbally leaves no doubt about what is happening. 3. In anticipation of your approval I have written to the Residency Agent suggesting that he should explain t,o the Shaikhs concerned (especially Sharjah and Dubai) the diffi culties which are likely to arise in future months in regard to food supplies, and advise them, in their own interests and in the interests of their subjects, to check immediately this wholesale entry of 'unwanted mouth8 ,, . 4 . i have asked the Residency Agent to let me know whether, and to what extent, the Shaikhs concerned follow this advice. The methods they adopt to prevent unwanted immigrants landing can, I think, best be left to them. Yours sincerely, The Hon* ‘ ^ ' ' “ ” ^ ®Confidential* D.Q.No.C/604 * The Agency, Bahrain, the 6th May 1942. While I was at Sharjah you mentioned that large numbers of Persians were migrating ^ the Persian Coast in search of food and labour. The Political Resident has now informed me that over 3000 persons including women and children have recently sailed for the Trucial Coast from Jask alone. 2. At Bahrain Persian immigration is strictly con trolled, and Persians are not allowed to land unless they have legitimate business there. 3. As you are aware, the problem of food supplies for the Arab Coast is becoming increasingly acute. Exports from India are already restricted, and might, in certain circumstances, be cut off entirely. It is hoped that quotas will shortly be fixed for food supplies to the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms, but these quotas will not make provision for fresh immigrants, as they will be based on the normal requirements of past years. 4. It seems to me that very serious difficulties will be created for the Trucial Coast Shaikhs if they continue to allow unrestricted entry of Persian immigrants. Unless, therefore, you have reason to think that the Persian immigrants can somehow be absorbed into the local population without disturbing the present economic equilibrium, I suggest that you should approach the Shaikhs concerned and especially the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah - point out to them the extent to which the presence in their terr itory of these immigrants will add to the food shortage which may be expected, and advise them, in their own interests and in the interests of their subjects, to check Khan Sahib Abdul Razzak, Residency Agent, Sharjah. / immediately- 2 - immediately this wholesale immigration of Unwanted mouths’• 5.
