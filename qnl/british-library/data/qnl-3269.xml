IN my telegram No. 209, dated the 27th December, I reported that, according to a statement made to me by Fuad Bey, the German Minister at Bagdad was coming to Jedda for the pilgrim season. I now have the honour to send some details about this visit. 2. Although the application of Dr. Grobba for permission to make a direct flight to Jedda was refused by the Saudi Government, he did, in fact, arrive in an aeroplane, on the 21st January. The machine was a three-engined Junker low-wing monoplane of the Luft-Hansa, and the chief pilot, according to Dr. Grobba, was one of the best German pilots, with a record of over 2 million miles. Dr. Grobba said that he had hoped to fly direct to Jedda, but had been obliged to abandon this plan because there was no place on the direct route where the machine could refuel, and he had therefore flown to Assouan, where they had taken on enough fuel for the flight to Jedda and back. The absence of any refuelling station on the way must have provided the Saudi Government with an easy pretext for rejecting a proposal which they would probably have been unwilling to accept in any case. 3. Two journalists arrived with Dr. Grobba. but they returned with the aeroplane three days later. Dr. Grobba told me that one of them had intended to stay for a fortnight, but finding no copy he returned to Cairo. He has since said that in spite of the shortness of their stay the journalists propose to write ' all sorts of things.' 4. The only secretary who accompanied Dr. Grobba was M. W. G. Steffen, who is his Arabic interpreter. M. Steffen talks Arabic very well, and also reads and writes it. I learned from Dr. Grobba that M. Steffen was a Seventh Day Adventist missionary for many years, in Egypt, Transjordan (? Mosul), and that having become dissatisfied with that life he joined the staff of the German Embassy in Bagdad. M. Steffen wears the Nazi badge; Dr. Grobba does not. 5. Dr. Grobba was at pains from the beginning to talk about the exclusively commercial object of his mission. He professed, however, to be much annoyed at a newspaper report that the German Government had sent him to offer assistance to the Saudi Government in the development of their oil and mineral resources, and described it as a Jewish invention. In his last talk with me Dr. Grobba spoke about the possibility of exporting German goods to Saudi Arabia either on payment or under a system of barter. He also said that he had collected (though with a considerable reduction) a sum of money due to a German firm which no longer exists in Jedda, for tyres and other goods supplied many years ago. I am dealing with these commercial matters in a separate despatch. 6. Although Dr. Grobba arrived on the 21st January, it was not until the 11th February that he was able to present his credentials. The Viceroy, the Amir Faisal, being absent when he arrived, it was decided that he, and the new French Minister, should wait until Ibn Saud came to Jedda after the pilgrimage. This arrangement was sensible, but Dr. Grobba seemed surprised and slightly annoyed when I mentioned that the King had asked me to meet him at Shumaisi on the 27th January—an interview which I reported in my telegram No. 16 of the 29th January. 7. On the 16th February Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, acting, as he said, on instructions from the King, gave me an account of Dr. Grobba's interviews with him and with the King. I have given the gist of what was said, in my telegram No. 25, dated the 18th February. Dr. Grobba claimed to have no object except to establish friendly relations with Saudi Arabia and to increase German exports, [555 o—2]N t i among which he mentioned arms. When he was informed that on account of geographical and other considerations the Saudi Government regarded friendship with Great Britain as essential, he disclaimed any desire to make any arrange ment with Saudi Arabia which would conflict with her friendship with His Majesty's Government, with whom the German Government also desired to be friends, though they found that their good intentions were not always reciprocated. Dr. Grobba went out of his way to make what appears to be an incorrect statement as to the relations between Germany and Italy. He said that there was no treaty or other arrangement between the two countries except that which bound each to come to the help of the other, if the other was in danger of being ' crushed.'' 8. In a private interview, which I had with Ibn Saud the same day, he supplemented the information which had been given to me by Yusuf Yasin. He said that Dr. Grobba informed him that Germany wanted to see Saudi Arabia strong so that she might be able to maintain her independence and resist the pressure of His Majesty's Government. It was apparently this approach which impelled the King to say that friendship with His Majesty's Government was essential to his country. 9. At the same private interview I mentioned to Ibn Saud the curious fact that the Dr. Euwaiha (my telegram No. 20, dated the 14th February) who had come to him as an emissary from Fauzi Qauqji was doctor to the German Legation in Bagdad. On the occasion of his farewell visit Dr. Grobba had said, just as he was leaving, that he had been surprised to see Dr. Euwaiha in Jedda : the man had brought him a letter from Frau Grobba, from Bagdad, but had now disappeared. The Minister wondered what the man's business could be. He looked enquiringly at me, but I said with perfect truth that I did not know Ruwaiha. Dr. Grobba was evidently uneasy. He took unnecessary pains to explain that the legation employed Dr. Ruwaiha, in spite of the fact that he was a Syrian, because he had been trained in Germany and because the other Bagdad doctors were all Jews. I passed this information on to Ibn Saud. who then told me that, according to Dr. Ruwaiha, the Germans had promised 2 000 rifles to the Iraqi supporters of the Palestine revolt and had sent them 200 which had been duly transmitted to Palestine, but a second consignment had been seized m the customs by the Iraq Government on information laid by c ' a follower of the Agha Khan. I said that I believed that some cartridges had been seized in the custom-house in Bagdad, but I did not remember a seizure oi rifles. a } 0 \ I ^ 1S tl:iat tlie establishment of diplomatic relations between baudi Arabia and Germany will lead to the supplv of German munitions of war to the Saudi Government. The German Minister was asked whether Germanv could supply arms at low prices and easy instalments, and he promised to trv o arrange this.

But for its poverty, which compels it to turn to the cheapest market, viz., Japan, Saudi Arabia is the ideal country for the German exporter, since its exports are insignificant and it has free currency obtained from the pilgrimage and from royalties on oil. The revenue from oil is at present small, but within a short time it may be coming in at the rate of nearly a million sterling a year. ~~3: Saudi Arabia also suits Germany as a markef in that the King is very anxious to establish a standing army, and that Germany is able 'to supply arms and^ammunition. We know from confidential sources that the German Minister prornisecTto do his best to ensure the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia at low prices ancToii easy terms of payment, and it may be assumed that his task will be facilitafed by political considerations. So far, it seems, only Mauser rifles and ammunition have been in question, but as the oil revenues increase, orders for other munitions, such as guns and armoured cars, might well be placed in Germany. - 'Kel* • t v * 4. In my despatch No. 206'E. dated the 30th October, 1938, I reported on a transaction by which Saudi lamb skins had been sold in Germany at a good price on condition that the sellers bought German goods to twice the amount which the skins realised. Muhammad Ali Riza, who effected this transaction, stated at the time that this arrangement suited Saudi Arabia at the moment, but might not always be convenient. 5. In his final visit to me just before his departure Dr. Grobba talked a good deal about trade prospects. He admitted that the creation of a regular army would give Germany an opportunity to tender for the supply of arms. He saw only restricted opportunities for the use of the barter system with Saudi Arabia, but hoped that Germany might take a larger share of Saudi exports of skins. He said that the Saudi authorities had also suggested as suitable articles for barter, millet from Jizan and dates from Hasa; but as Germany only wants millet for fodder and dates for the extraction of spirit the prices she is likely to be able to offer cannot be tempting unless politics is to take precedence of economics. I have no special knowledge of the Hasa date trade, but I believe that the Hasa dates, which ripen earlier than the dates in Basra, command a fair price as food in India and Persian Gulf ports. But I am inclined to believe that the Saudi suggestions about millet and dates were not very serious, and that such German goods as are sold here will usually be sold for cash. 6.

His Royal Highness told Sir Lancelot Oliphant that he was very appreciative of the warm terms in which the Prime Minister's letter was couched and tnen enquired, as I recorded in my despatch under reference, in what form, and how quickly Saudi Arabia might expect help should a situation arise in which the coromunity of interests 'between Saudi Arabia, and Great Britain led to their being faced with a common ene .riy. This is a point on which you will receive instructions in due course, 3. His Royal Highness then alluded to the phrase 'potential aggressors' which occurs in the sixth pa agraph of the Prime minister's letter. He asked whether it was the opinion of the Foreign Office that, in the present unstable state of the world, some form of aggression might 'be exercised against Saudi Arabia. He was told that any act of aggression in the near future seemed very doubtful. Indeed, Herr Hitler's recent activities could not have been welcome to those who had/ Sir Reader Bullard, KGMG., CIS,, etc,, etc,, etc#, Jedda,9 2. had. hitched their chariot to his star, and tt was unlikely that any country wnich had done so would willingly undertake intensive activity in Arabia. But in Herr Hitler's case it as no longer a question of dealing with a normal, logical man, and it was always possible that he might incite those whom he regarded as his friends to follow him even now» It might, hov/ever, be doubted whether Italy, if pursuing her claims against France, would simultaneously show any aggressive action in the East. It was not possible to sa t / any more than this. 4, His Royal Highness then spoke of Koweit, and asked whether there was any likelihood of His ; ajesty's Governuient allowing its incorporation in Iraq. The answer was an HU.MWW, , ^ , emphatic negative* 6« His Royal Highness finally turned to the situation in the Persian Gulf, lie was assured that, far from it being the policy of His Majesty's Government to encroach upon the autonomy of the local yheikhs, His I'la^esty's Government had always been most careful to preserve their autonomy. He was reminded that his brother, the Amir Saud, when he had visited Bahrein some fifteen months ago, had been Impressed by the absence of any signs of dictation by His Majesty's Government^ He was also told, by way of illustration, that although His Majesty's Government had met with considerable difficulty in establishing an air port on the Trucial Coast, yet later, when the Sheikh of Debai saw that the freedom of the Sheikh of Sharjah had been in no wise diminished since the Imperial Airways service had been introduced, this Bheikh had himself ■ pressed for the air port to be transferred to Debai. 6.

S ection 1. [E 2313/177/25] Copy No. Viscount Halifcur to Sir R. Bullard (Jedda). (No. 86.) Sir, Foreign Office, March 29, 1939. THE Amir Faisal came to see me on the 24th March in order to say good-bye before leaving London on the conclusion of the conferences on Palestine. His Royal Highness was accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and by Fnad Bey Hamza, who interpreted. 2. His Royal Highness said that he had received from the Prime Minister the day before a letter which Mr. Chamberlain had asked him to convey to King Abdul Aziz in reply to the letter which he had brought to Mr. Chamberlain from his father on his arrival in this country. The Prime Minister had suggested that, if there were any points in this letter which he desired to discuss before his departure, he should do so when he saw me to-day. He was most grateful for the full reply which had been given to his father's enquiries, and for the frank and friendly tone of the letter as a whole. There were, however, certain points in the letter which were not entirely clear, and he wondered whether there were any additional explanations which I would care to give him. 3. I told His Royal Highness that I was glad of this opportunity to make certain comments upon the letter, as it dealt with one point of fundamental importance about which I would like to say something. This point was the p ossi bility of aggression against Saudi Arabia. King Abdul Aziz had asked, if T remembered rightly, what would be the attitude of this country were Saudi Arabia to be the victim of aggression. The meaning of the Prime Minister's letter upon this point was, I hoped, entirely clear, but the language used was official and diplomatic. I therefore wished to fill in the picture in language which it would be difficult to put on paper. 4. I then went on to say that I could not imagine circumstances ever arising in which Saudi Arabia was the victim of aggression by a major Power without Great Britain being at war; and if Great Britain were at war, those who were attacked by her enemies would be her friends, and she would, I was convinced, shape her policy accordingly. Moreover, the facts of geography made it inevitable that Great Britain, with her manifold responsibilities in India, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, should always regard the eastern coast of the Red Sea as an area of vital consequence. I did not think, therefore, that King Abdul Aziz need have any doubt but that, if the case arose, the interests of Saudi Arabia would be found to be the interests of Great Britain. I was not trying to say anything new which was not already said in the letter. I only wished to give additional emphasis to certain points made in the letter. 5. The Amir Faisal said that King Abdul Aziz had never doubted the objects of British policy or supposed that they had changed. But he had felt that the times demanded that his relations with Great Britain should be set out more clearly than might have been necessary hitherto. Since, therefore, the opportunity had occurred he had thought it right to address this enquiry to His Majesty's Government in accordance with the frankness which characterised all his relations with Great Britain. 6. Both His Royal Highness and I had other appointments and the few remaining minutes had to be devoted to Palestine. It must therefore be a matter for speculation whether His Royal HighnesTwould have asked for a guarantee of a more formal and binding character had there been more time for discussion. His Royal Highness did, however, ask Sir Lancelot Oliphant, whom he saw a little later, how the mechanical side of the community of interests between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia would work in a crisis : how soon, for instance, could help from Great Britain reach Saudi Arabia and what form would it take ? His Royal Highness was told that the difficulty of answering hypothetical questions of this kind was as a rule insuperable. But the enquiry would nevertheless be examined with a view to seeing whether there was any answer which could be sent through you to the Saudi Arabian Government. | 555 ff—1 ]0 2 7. Our brief conversation about Palestine was confined to a reference by me to the two main questions which seemed stili to be outstanding between the British delegates and the delegates of the neighbouring Arab States. The first Question was how soon Palestinian Ministers could become heads of departments. Could this take place at once, or rather as soon as peaceful conditions had been restored in Palestine, or must we wait until His Majesty s Government and the British authorities in Palestine were satisfied that conditions in Palestine were such as to enable this change to be effected ? I wondered whether a solution of this problem might not be found by agreeing that Palestinian Ministers should be placed in charge of departments within a period of two years from the time when peaceful conditions had been restored. The second outstanding point was the difficulty which had arisen in regard to the end of the transition period. His Majesty's Government hoped that conditions in Palestine would enable that country to obtain her independence in ten years' time, but the question arose what should happen if, at the end of ten years, His Majesty's Government were to decide that the establishment of an independent State must be postponed. My own suggestion would be that in that event we might consult with the Govern ments of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia before taking a final decision regarding the postponement of the end of the transition period. 8.

Copy No. Mr. Neville Chamberlain to King Ihn Saud. \our Majesty, Downing Street, March 23, 1939. I HAVE had the honour to receive from His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal the letter addressed to me by your Majesty and dated the 2nd January, 1939. I have asked His Royal Highness to be good enough to convey to your Majesty my respectful thanks for this letter and my keen appreciation of your generous reference to my efforts in the cause of peace. I am very grateful for the friendliness and frankness with which your Majesty is always ready to discuss all matters of mutual interest to our two countries. The Government of the United Kingdom greatly value the friendship of your Majesty and appreciate the assistance they have always received from you, more particularly oyer the difficult question of Palestine. They share your Majesty s view that their community of interests in the Middle East requires that there should be the closest co-operation between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. Your Majesty mentioned in your letter certain points on which you desired to ascertain the views of His Majesty's Government. The first of these points was the question of Palestine. The Government of the United Kingdom fully realise the importance of this question in its effect not only on that country, but also on relations between Great Britain and the whole Arab world. The Government of the United Kingdom are now considering the question of policy in the light of the conferences on Palestine, which have just been discussing the problem, and it is not possible at the moment to say more. But His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal, who has played so large a part in the conferences, will have realised, I hope, that it is the sincere and earnest desire of the Government of the United Kingdom to find a final solution which shall da justice to all parties and which shall conserve the rights of the Arabs in Palestine. Secondly, your Majesty enquires what attitude this country would adopt if Saudi Arabia were to be the victim of aggression. As long as relations between Great Britain and the Arab countries remain as they are at present, it is difficult to envisage any aggression on Saudi Arabia by her neighbours. Nor can it be supposed that, leaving aside the possibility of a general war in which the position of Great Britain as a world Power was being challenged, any European Power would wantonly attack Saudi Arabia, especially as the Government of the United Kingdom have made it clear how deep is the interest that they take in the preservation by Saudi Arabia of her independence and integrity. The declara tions of the Government on this subject correspond to one of the major interests of British imperial policy, and I personally think that these declarations are sufficient by themselves to deter potential aggressors (except, as I say, in the possible eventuality of a general challenge to Great Britain) since the nature of this policy and the grounds on which it is based must be apparent to the Governments of all other States. With regard to the proposal for mutual consultation on all matters affecting Arab countries, your Majesty is aware that the Government of the United Kingdom desire at all times to obtain your views on such matters. They will welcome every opportunity to consult with your Majesty on all questions involving the common interests of the two countries. . I n your fourth point, your Majesty asks that you may be given an oppor tunity of expressing your views before any change is introduced in the status of any Arabic-speaking country. So far as the Government of the United Kingdom can judge, there is no prospect (apart from Palestine—and Syria and the Lebanon—whose future status is now under discussion) of a change in the status of any Arabic-speaking country. But should the Arab countries at some future [555 z—1]time desire closer union or some form of federation, Great Britain would consider this to be a question for negotiation and decision among the Arab States themselves. Certainly the Government have no intention of taking an^ initiative in this question, more especially as it will scarcely be piacticabie for Palestine or Syria to participate in a federation for a considerable time. It is possible, however, that your Majesty, in framing this question, was thinking less of federation than of the future status of Transjordan. I he Government of the United Kingdom cannot tie their hands in regard to a question for which they are responsible to the League of Nations, by giving undertakings abou: this question to third parties. But should the possibility arise of changes in Trans- jordan, they will certainly remember that any changes in a neighbouring territory of this kind must always be of especial interest and concern to your Majesty and will take this factor into account in framing their policy. With regard to the suggestion that the two countries should decide before hand on the attitude to be adopted towards a third State whose policy may affect our common interests, the Government of the United Kingdom, w T hi]e they would welcome mutual consultation on such points as may arise, feel that in view of the impossibility of foreseeing what action a third State may take in the future, it would be unwise and dangerous for the two Governments to attempt now to lay down a common policy to meet all eventualities. I would, however, say this. Any action which tends to weaken the position of Great Britain in the Middle East must inevitably tend to expose the Middle Eastern Powers to greater danger than at present, for none of those Powers as yet possess the military and other resources necessary to make an effective stand against any Power which was able to usurp the place of Great Britain in the Middle East. No other Power is likely to fill the place of Great Britain without wishing to acquire extensive rights of interference in the political and, more especially, the economic affairs of the Middle Eastern countries, and the best service which those who have the interests of the Middle Eastern States at heart can render to those States is to persuade them to discourage firmly all activities, such as the dissemination of propaganda, which are likely to undermine the position either of Great Britain or of Erance. This is, however, a point upon which I may not have wholly grasped your Majesty's meaning, and if your Majesty would care to make further suggestions through Sheikh Hafiz Wahba or Sir Reader Bullard the Government of the United Kingdom will be most happy to consider them. Finally, your Majesty requests a definition of the meaning and extent of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April, 1938. This agreement is an agree ment between Great Britain and Italy alone. No other Power is asked to lecognise or to be bound by it. The relations between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia are therefore governed by their treaties and by their friendship alone, and the Anglo-Italian Agreement does not indicate the slightest pretension on t e part of the Government of the United Kingdom to restrict the liberty of action of Saudi Arabia. I am prepared, if your Majesty thinks it desirable, to reply more fully on this point m answer to the note verbale handed to bir Reader Bullard on the 13th November, 1938. I would conclude by assuring your Majesty once again how highly the Government of the United Kingdom value the relations of confidence that so happily exist between your Majesty and Great Britain. I have little doubt that Vl ; 1 - lr a J® s y wi J share my view, that this confidence and the clear community S f f ,i exlSl t ; vee !' O' 1 ' two countries are the best assurance for the maintenance of those good relations on which both countries so greatly depend. , , ^' s Royal Highness to convey to your Majesty, with my ^ compliments, my sincere good wishes for your long life and prosperity.

For an hour the ground was absolutely flat and bare; leter on lots of Arfaj bushes and herds of camels belonging to the Mutair tribe. At 1-15 p.m. we stopped for luncheon about seven miles from JARYA then vftrip on over the hills into JARYA^ depression arriving at about 2 p«m. Here we were greeted by a Guard of Honour of Police dressed in Khaki and grey Jbdpurs, and two Tn^n standing in front of a smart Indian tent of yellow and blue, one a young Syrian, slim pale and elegant, with a budding black moustache and small goatee beard, who to my surprise greeted me in fault- less French. He had been specially sent by His Majesty, who was in Camp some two hours away, to welcome us with the -Amir of J arya. *Ls, it we had only known it, we would not have had our Pionio/picnic lunch in the desert, for after a short conversation we were lead into another tent where a table was laid for four f and a six course European lunch was served, consisting of tepid soup, tinned salmon mayonnaise, chicken fried potatoes, mutton outlets, rissoles in pastry and stewed apricots with orange Jam roll* The local water of JARYA did not taste very good but we were told it had been purified, coffee, chiefly of cardamom and little coffee in it,followed by sweet tea tasting of petrol# Twefik Ibrahim el Hashim left to telegraph to the King of our arrival, so we were left alone in a tent to rest but Khalid insisted upon a ceaseless flow of conversation# At 4-15 p.m. we bade farewell to the Amir and made for Si Hamaar where the King had arrived to camp for the night, leaving in the early morning for JARYA, and so South to visit his Oil Wellso After an hour and a half motoring over a very bad sandy road between strange table top formations, sandstone hills, we suddenly saw a large camp below us# Accompanied by Ibrahim we were met by YUSSIF YASSIN the, King^ Private Secretary, and sat and talked for half an hour on very uncomfortable chairs, with the word w Welcome ft burnt on the backs. Shortly prayers took place, and it was strange sight to see hundreds of men in a long line genuflecting, giving the impression of waves in the distance o Meanwhile, we had time to wash for dinner which was served at a table in another tent# Again six courses and more were served, the party consisting of ^ussif Yassin, the King's Syrian doctor, Khalid the Interpreter, Ibrahim, lady Carlisle aid myself# The conversation chiefly turned on Palestine troubles, whic 1 ^ Yussif Yassin said ran like a poison through tiie whole Arab world, which wished to be friendly with the English, a problem he said M that was easy to deal with frcm their point of view, but he understoofl the difficulties of the English'. He employed silly arguments, such as 'how would we like Jews to be planted on us in England to govern us w and so forth. I said 'that between foreign propaganda and self-seeking politicians it was very difficult to settle, but that was convinced that if- 3 ^ , f \J s If only the people were left to themselves It would solve itself'. He said 'they were perfectly aware of Inflamatory propaganda from abroad', hut I said 'nonetheless, young people would always be influenced by it'. -After dinner me sat outsidf; and had coffee and more gossip. I mistrust wholeheartedly Tussif Yassin, whose profile looks like an ancient ^-Syrian sculpture, with his pointed beard, eyes and nose, all at different angles, i 7 Teft me shortly to see the King, and then returned to say that we would be received after 8-15 p.m. He asked me 'what particular question had I to ask His Majesty.' I replied guardedly 'none in particular', ^nd we then drove to the King's tent. I was particularly struck by his magnetic personality, charming manner and smile also his way of putting one at his ease. After the usual compliments I asked him his opinion of the European situation. He replied 'that all countries were equally, in their different ways, working towards a war but that he hoped that the democracies would succeed in keeping the peace, and that it was necessary with proper understanding that England and Arabia should progress side by side for they both needed each other, but that other Nations should not be allowed to interefere or come between them'. I had been told by Ibrahim to avoid the Palestine question as it made him sad; he also told me that he had sent Roosvelt a letter on the subject a copy of which he said he would give me but which unfortunately I forgot to ask for. Lady Carlisle asked questions about Hurl Pasha and 'Iraq, all of which were turned off in a religious discourse by the King, I praised the democratic spirit of Arabia, His Majesty replied 'that in Government, power must he used in the right way and that only re li gion could teach it and that ought not to be fanatical, but moderate, tempered with understanding'.The Moslem owed every thing to Allah, 8. the Koran gave the law as of idfe to be followed, thirdly there was the obligation to treat your neighbour Justly. eVery0ne that ** ls 3f or one who has attained know how to ::r™ in S87lng tllat feW having attain ed It time was airead^ ' ^ ^ YaSSin -me already anxious for us to » , ' e took 0U1, leave.

His Ifc lesty receives every night all the wireless reports from lender, and Berlin, as well as Arabic brleasts from all q u arters . ^ ' ni^itly reeds about fifty pages of them. I had the impression that real or polltlcal questlon was taboo&gt; and ^ that not neing able to speak or understand the language a great disadvantage # At midnight or after when we returned to our sleeping tent which Yassm had made comfortable with mattresses and pillows a slight reviving drink was necessary after the long drive a- ' emotions of th e evening. The result was that we sat and talked until 3 a.m. with the prospect of a start at dawn, 26th April , ^ Q-^Q,, At 4-30 a.m. I woke up and the camp was still there and fee beginning for the departure was being made. A t 5-15 a.m. I looked out already dressed to find that L a dy Carlisle end myself were practically the only people sitting there, surrounded only by the desert strewn wld* the debris peculiar to an A r ab in omp. Luckily in the hot dry air it was not noticeable to the nostrils. Breakfasted wiih Khalid. noticed that the servant was a Soudanese whom I recognized was one who was in the employment of ^ir -andrew Ryan our Mmister in Jedda when I was staying with him three years befo^,. He asked after de Gaury. Tuseif Tassin arrived with presents from the King of clothes and money for our servants, an i.rab dress of purple and ora^e silk he^ily embroidered in gold for Ldy Car lis*, an&lt;a an Arab oostume ^ myself and a gold dagger. We were shortly Joined by ibrahim who had come to say good-bye to Lady Carlisle who unfortunately was still dressing. YUSSIF YA3SIN told me the King Would ^ ageln at Oarya and say good-bye if we would leave shortly after hir We eventually leCt. al Hamaar at 7 a m , 8-30 On t * rea0hed Jarya at about n the way I changed into the Kafigv, filnp . ,, oloek the t the Ki ng had given/given me, and also wore the dagger. The cloak was big and heavy, big enou^i to have been made for His Majesty, which made it awkward to wear® The drive to Jarya was even worse than on our arrival, for the road across the sands had been well cut up by the I r ord lorries and cars moving camp, which I believe consisted of some seven hundred men and two hundred and sixty or more cars % ?he s igiit on arrival at tbe Sort of Jarya gave one the impression of a large market place enfete, everywhere groups of people looking happy and proud, masses of various cars driving all over the place# 0 u r car was immed iately surrounded on all sides by many A r abs, handsome Bedoilin with flashing teeth and long curls, enormous niggers with bandoliers and rifles, and young boys laughing with gay open smile, all wishing to have their photo graphs takeno Yussif Tgssin sent a message that the King was ready to receive us, and we drove under the gateway into the courtyard of the Fort* His Majesty was holding his diwan on the roof - Lady Carlisle and myself had great difficulty in walking up the stairs in our unaccustomed clothes chiefly because the stairs no longer existed, being built merely of mud they had disintegrated# I very nearly tripped up over my cloak, put my foot through the skirt, and nearly lost my sandles# I saluted tkm H}s Majesty and squatted down on ^his right with Khalid the Interpreter# As usual Yussif Yassin had placed himself so that $one had to look at him when talking through IQialid, and always hftd the feeling of his baneful eye upon me, waiting to signal the moment that I should withdraw. A clerk was reading the wireless news from Various capitals - it was interesting to hear that compulsory service for boys from 18 to 21 had been decided upon in England, in these surrounding, and the more extraordinary as tlE t on my return to Kuwait that evening, they did not yet know there, and only heard it on the Kadio at that evening as being in Chamberlain's speech that afternoon# One would think that a vast desert country practically closed to all Eurppeans would be away behind other Arab countries that have touched Western civilization and ideas, Mc like Iraq. On thethe contrary, His Majesty has so organized his people that withou loosing their individuality as Arabs, keeping a pure Arab civili zation, he yet manages to have the best information which, couple with his om judgemoit, to him a natural instinct, and rare gift, he is able to sum up the situation all over the worlds In every way it struck me how excellent his organization must be* The fac 4 ' that he took the trouble to send a young Syrian clerk who spoke French to meet us hours away, with a tent to resst in, and the compliment of a European meal to eat, shows what meticulous care to detail is to be found in this desert Kingdom. The King agreed with the idea of conscription, and seemed extremely pleased, and again reiterated how necessary was for us both the friendship between his country and Great Britain^ I thanked him for his present and said the gold dagger would always remain a treasure in my house, thecn said good-bye as he was obviously busy* Outside the diwan was a flat open roof with warriors grouped about on it - lady Carlisle asked Yussif Yassin if she could photograph them. He rather demurred and said that His Majesty was in a hurry, and would shortly be coming out® Nothing daunted she took the camera from Khalid and started to focus the group through her veil, not noticing that at that moment the King appeared in the doorway, and stood looking on wilh a smile on his face. I could but admire the courage of women in such circumstanc 3 where even without the presence of King I should have hesitated to photo graph« We left Jarya about 9-30 a .mo reaching Kuwait just before 4 p.m* In spite of lack of sleep and motoring for hours through great heat one did not feel any special fatigue - the air of Hie desert must be so invigorating* How right the Arabs are to know the King as EL SHEIKH SS SHOUKH the Sheikh of Sheikhs* The people seem happy and admire and look up to the King as their leader and he has the monopoly in his Kingdom of all wireless and motor cars, which gives him both a full warning of any revolt there might be and a means boT and a monopoly of ^swiit counter action, which is not possessed by anyone elseo Th«. seems to be no reason tha t on his death the Kingdom of'j , * - 7 - of Saudi Arabia should not continueo The King and Nejdi in general seems to me to be a person who could be relied upon in war, if his word were once given, he is not like saiie other Eastern nations who I believe would always be treacherous, if events went against us, whatever their professions^ I was very greatly impressed, not only by the radiating personality of the King, which I had been led to expect, but the sense of great control from the centre, an3 reliability, which even the short glimpse of his Court gave one* A good friend for England to have and one worth taking trouble with I felt* 5 3 \ j&gt; No* 75 British Legation# (925A72/14) Jedda. April 20th.t 1959. Lord, I have the honour to submit some itejne of infor ??mtion ahout the recent Japanese mission to Saudi Arabia, to - ' -- -' ir ™ p. I, supplement those given in my telegram Mo. 49 dated April 13 th. 2. According to Shaikh Yuauf Yasin, it ie with the object of compelling Japan to buy part of the naea date crop that the quota proviBion has been inserted in the 8audi counter-draft. S» Shaikh Yusuf also says that the treaty ie to contain an undertaking by Japan to encourage the pilgrimage. The Japanese interest in the pilgrimage is confirmed by a certain Yahya i usa Bokhari, who tvae mentioned in paragraph . - rn -—— 160 of the Jedda 'Report for April 1938 ae having been sent to Janan by his father ^to become an expert in electricty% and was referred to in the local press later on as having arrived in fokio to engage in propaganda for the pilgrimage. 4. The information obtained from this Yahya is as follows. The Japanese Minister was well satisfied with his visit to Kiyadh. The main object of the mission was to arrange for the opening of a legation in Jedda: the Japanese not only wished to strengthen trade relations, but soon they would be the friends and guardians of the Moslems in China. On his return from Tokio, where he saw officials at the Japanese Foreign Office, Yahya called at Cairo and saw the Japanese Minister. As the result of these talks / he Right Honourable the Yiscount Halifax, K.G., ^c. &amp;c.,, 'N &gt; ^ he eubrnitted a report to the Saudi Covernment saying that the Japanese were great friends or Islam and ware very anxious to 'be friendly with the protector o. the Holy laces* 5. Y bhys expects that a J apaneee negation will 'be established in Jcdda shortly. The Japanese inieter in Oftiro will be i inieter to Saudi Arabia also^ but when he is in Egypt there will be someone in charge of the negation. Yahya* ^ho now knows some Japanese as well as Italian end inglish# is apparently hoping to secure a post of some kind in the legation# and hie father# who is a pilgrim guide* is expecting to reap a hr rveet ^hen pilgrims begin to arrive from territories for which the Japanese are responsible# 6» It would be easy for the Japanese to carry pilgrims at low price© in yen in their own ships* but to provide each pilgrim with the foreign currency necessary for his mainten- jnc^ in this country and for the payment of the pilgrim dues would be leoa easy. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His i jesty 1 n mbaecadcrs at Cairo (lio. 9^6/773/14) and Bagdad (Ho. 927/772/14) and to the Honourable the Political esident in the Persian Qulf (iN0.9S&amp;/77'&lt;i/i4).

You may inform Ibn Saud in confidence that His Majesty's G -overnment have learned with interest of his views, as recorded 'by Sheikh Yusuf Yasiiiy and that the following are their views • upon the points which he has raised. 2 0 As His Majesty's G-overnment have already explained, they do not think it in the least likely that Saudi Arabia will be wantonly attackedo Even if general hostilities should begin it is unlikely that Italy would attempt to occupy positions on the Saudi-Arabian coast 9 since they already possess bases in Eritrea which are in a more favourable strategical position from which to threaten British communications in the Red Sea^ Nor is it likely that Italy will wish to add Saudi Arabia to her enemies» But in the unlikely event of Italy taking such action, His Majesty's G-overnment in their own interests ? if for no other reason, would take steps to restore the positiono 3^ His Majesty's G-overnment have no reason to suppose that Iraq has any hostile designs against any other State, even including Koweit, The recent Irao L i propaganda about conditions in.o c o,S) in Koweit has certainly been troublesome ? hut His Majesty 5 s Q-ovem inent have repeatedly made it clear to the Iraqi Government that they will not tolerate any modification of its status and this being so they find it difficult to take this propaganda seriously in the sense of supposing it will lead to any deliberate attempt to secure •such a modifies Gion by force. His Majesty's Government would., however, welcome any further action which Ibn Saud might feel dis posed to take to impress upon General Nuri the folly of the agita tion and propaganda dire:ted against Koweit. 4,Apart from Kuweit question^ Iraqi Government may possibly look forward to the day when Irao^ will? they hope s play a leading part in a federation with other Arab States. But here again His Majesty's Government have no reason to suppose that Iraqi Government expect to create this federation by any but peaceful means.. Certainly no such federation could be reated except after prolonged discussion in which Ibn Saud would be able to make his views fully known« 5* In the opinion of His Majesty 1 s Government the Turkish Government have no intention, apart from the Hatry, of attempting to recover any portion of former Ottoman empire. Continued unrest in Syria s especially in parts adjoining Turkey may. howevery make the Turkish Government feel that some action similar to that whih has N already resulted in the virtual cession of the Hatay is necessary in Turkish interests 0 In the interests of Syria two things are im portant if this is to be avoided. One is an agreement between France and the Syrians. The other is that the politicians of Damascus, who have hitherto dominated the Governments of Syria and have successfully managed while in office to antagonise most of the minorities ana many of the Arabs (e.g. of Aleppo), should in future adopt methods which will van the confidence and goodwill of all sections of the population.o By Mail.

THE impression which I had the honour to report to you in my telegram No. 72, dated the 3rd June, that his Highness the Amir Faisal would like to see me at Taif, was borne out when I saw his Highness, who wished to deliver to me the letter from Ibn Saud which I summarised in my telegram No. 1 from Taif, dated the 13th June, and also to talk to me on the same subject, viz., the attempt of Iraq to secure a leading position in the Arab world at the expense of Ibn Saud. The Amir also spoke about Palestine (see my telegram No. 78 dated the 17th June), and several other subjects of smaller importance were likewise discussed. 2. In spite of the fact that his Highness has been Minister for Foreign Affairs during the whole of my time here as Minister, this was the first occasion on which I had been able to talk business with him. Hitherto, there had always been someone like Fuad or Yasin at hand, reporting to Ibn Saud direct rather than to the Amir Faisal. I was agreeably surprised by the readiness with which his Highness replied to considerations which I put forward. Perhaps the part he played in the London discussions has given him greater self-confidence, or the soundings taken by the French High Commissioner in Syria about a possible Saudi candidate for the Syrian Throne have awakened him from the lethargy in which he usually seems to be plunged. 3. His Highness spoke with high appreciation of the treatment which he had received in London, and with admiration and gratitude (if I may be allowed to mention this) of the patience and sympathy with which Mr. Malcolm MacDonald has presided over the Palestine discussions.

Telegraphic Message received from His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the Mh Jumad-al-Awwal, 1358 {June 22, 1939), and communicated to the Italian Minister at Jedda on the Same Day. (Translation.) THE friendly relations existing between us and Italy make it necessary for us to be frank in all matters concerning our two countries. The Italian Govern ment are aware of our general political position, and of our attitude towards the present European dispute. We, as far as possible, wish to avoid interfering in this dispute. It has happened that certain news has been broadcast from Italy and Germany concerning certain events such as the visit of Ibn-al-Waleed (Khalid Garqani) to Germany and the visit of Sir Bullard to the Amir Faisal at Taif. The two broadcasting stations have taken advantage of these two events to make propaganda against Great Britain. We, as the Italian Government are aware, wish to remain on friendly terms with all parties and have no wish to have our position exploited by one party against the other.

My Lord| Jedda, July 18, 1939. ^ I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a record of a conversation which I had from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin this morning. The sheikh reached Taif a few days ago, just in time to greet the French Minister when he arrived on a two days' visit beginning on the 11th July. I had already heard from M. Ballereau that he had had important conversations at 1 ait with His Roval Highness the Amir Feisal and Sheikh Y usuf \asin. The latter arrived in Jedda last night and requested me to call on him this morning. 2. The sheikh's statement, which was evidently communicated to me by express command of the King, shows how deeply His Majesty feels on two mam points viz., the Turkish menace to Arab independence, and the proposal to place a member of the Hashimite family on the Throne of Syria. M. Ballereau himself told me how keenly he appreciated the King's point of view on both these subiects and how he would use every effort to convince the French Government that it was essential to satisfy His Majesty about them both. As for the lur vis menace M. Ballereau spoke bitterly of recent Turkish broadcasts which had referred to the Hatay Agreement as something which merely returned to turkey what had been hers all the time and had emphasised that there was no question of the Turks being grateful to the French for this correction of an obvious injustice. The French Minister proposed to speak to his Turkish colleague with a view to arranging that the Turkish broadcasting service should at any rate cease harping on this particular note, which gave great offence to many local listeners. As for the Throne of Syria, M. Ballereau had toid me that he had explained that that question had merely reached the stage of a series ot vague proposals, which had originated with M. Puaux himse . e ci no tell me tJhat he had told the Amir that he personally (M. Ballereau) regarded the Amir Feisal as the ideal candidate. No doubt the King would like His Majesty's Government to be equally complimentary; the only comment f made on this question was to express hearty agreement when the sheikh saic, that whoever sat on the Throne of Syria would shoulder a heavv burden. 3. I have reported separately on the subject of arms. Sheikh Yusut Yasm told me that he had not told M. Ballereau that the German Government had opened a credit of half a million pounds sterling for the purchase of arms nor that they had presented to the Saudi Arabian Government 4 000 rifles and 8 mi no rounds of ammunition. The conversation with M. Ballereau at Taif, however, turned on tihe subject of arms owing to the French Minister s enquiry concerning the activities of Khalid-al-Hud. It was M. Ballereau who first suggested that the French Government might well supply such munitions as guns, machine guns and tanks M Ba ii er eau that some details of the letter sent by the King to Nuri Pasha A1 Said early this year were given to him. 5. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin proposed to stay m Jedda for some days, and expressed the hope that a reply from His Majesty's Government giving their comments and advice might arrive before he had to return to Riyadh I Pointec out that such matters take a considerable time to consider The sheikh said that the King was always glad to have the advice of His Majesty s Government and that His Majesty also thought that His Majesty s Government might to communicate what he had said, in some way best known to themselves, to the French Government. . , n i tt - at • ^ ' 8 I am sending copies of this despatch with the enclosure to His Majesty s representatives at Cairo and Bagdad, and to His Majesty s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus. _ .

Ballereau, French Minister at Jedda, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and the Amir Feisal.—{Communicated by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Trott at Jedda on July 18, 1939.) IBN SAUD realised that it was extremely important that the relations between the French and the British Governments should be close and cordial Their own interests prompted this policy. It was therefore to be hoped that both the British and the French would be friendly with all the Arab nations, especially with those which border or are very close to Saudi Arabia; in fact, with Syria and Palestine. Ibn Saud has therefore done his best confidentially to help to settle the question of Syria and Palestine in an amicable way. For instance, he sent his letter to Nuri Pasha A1 Said. But the Saudi action was conditioned by four main principles :— {a) Ibn Saud did not wish to intervene in the Syrian dispute in any way. (5) But, if he felt in danger, he would feel obliged to change his attitude. (c) There were two events which would make him feel in danger :— (1) If the Turks penetrated any further into the Arab countries, Ibn Saud would regard that as a threat to his independence. (2) If the Throne of Syria was granted to a member of the Hashimite family, and still more if it was granted to the Amir Abdullah, he would consider that a hostile act and a threat to his independence. (M. Ballereau, in reply to point (1), said that the recent treaty about Hatay had no clauses other than those which were well known; there were no other conditions or engagements about further acquisitions of territory by Turkey. As for (2), he said that it was not possible to appoint the Amir Abdullah to the throne; and that he would make sure on this point by referring to his Government for their confirmation.) {d) Ibn Saud realised that it was to the interests of the British and the French Governments to have a peaceful state of affairs in Syria and Palestine, especially with the present situation in Europe, and Ibn Saud was prepared to co-operate to that end, and to help as far as he could to settle the Syrian question on the basis of securing French interests and protecting those of the Syrians. Trouble in Syria had repercussions in Saudi Arabia, and for that reason Ibn Saud wanted to help towards a just solution. M. Ballereau spoke at some length about the Throne of Syria. He pointed out that the idea originated with the High Commissioner, who made certain tentative enquiries in a vague way. The personal opinion of M. Ballereau was that the best candidate for the Throne of Syria was the Amir Feisal. He knew that that was also the view of M. Puaux, and of several other prominent personages in the Government of Syria. There were, however, other opinions; some took the view that the appointment of the Amir Feisal would be unacceptable to His ivlajesty s Government m the united Kingdom, because in that case the rule of King Ibn Saud would gradually extend to'Trans Jordan and Palestine, bneikh Yusuf Y asin did not know whether what M. Ballereau said on this point was true or not. But he was authorised to say that, if it would help towards a general settlement in Syria to have the Amir Feisal on the throne, Ibn Saud would accept that solution, though he knew that such an extension of his responsibilities would be a heavy burden. Sheikh \ usuf Yasin told 1VI. Ballereau that the King quite saw how essential it was from the French point of view that an agreement should be reached with Turkey so as to settle the question of the northern neighbours of Syria. The King could not help saying that as an Arab he had no confidence whatever in any treaty or other engagement signed by the Turks, who would attack Syria and Iraq to-morrow if they felt that there was any chance of success owinff to any weakening by France or Britain. It was not that the Arabs hated 'the urks. They wanted to live m amity and in neighbourly relations with them. But they felt that the Turks were not to be trusted, and the Saudi Governmentwelcomed any help in securing the Arab territories from aggression by the Turks. Ibn Saud was able to assure M. Ballereau that, if the Syrian question ,/,&gt; were settled to the satisfaction of the Syrians, he would be willing to support H r' the French in resisting any Turkish attack. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin wished M. Ballereau to know that a Syrian named Adil Adhmi, a brother of Nabih Adhmi, who had been an important member of 4. Jamil Mardam's Government, was now in Riyadh. The King was giving him : good advice about the advisability of keeping order in Syria. ^pedlii ) natii ■in ft ideitii fay, ft te fai iider ft ut Half no ol ■ Turk dial; igtot andi 3 alesti ;pareil: ,e Sjii seofft for ii j poiitt e ceiti reau ® He ^ roin®' opinii ccepte that 3 alesti 8 1 OD^ iiild ^ e t¥ ensio^ essei liedf •ia. ^ ate^ 0 owm?: itl* 1 00/v this document is the property of his britannic majesty's government rify-Up'r September 13, 1939. ?, i S ections. EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL. . ^ l - &lt; - ■ • • co iifij [E 6M7/549/25] —— Copy No. Mr. Trott to Viscount Halifax.—[Received September 13.) My Lord Jed da, August 22, 1939. I HAVE the honour to report that during the last few days several events r have brought into prominence two matters which are already well known to your Lordship : viz., the apprehensions of the Saudi Royal family lest the throne of Syria should be given to a Hashimite candidate such as the Amir Abdullah, and the feeling, expressed on several occasions by King Abdul Aziz, that he is being subjected to organised attacks from certain elements in neighbouring Arab countr es^ ^ the King's secretary, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, brought for my inspection a postal bag containing a great number of letters addressed to prominent persons at Jedda, Mecca and Medina. Each letter was franked with Syrian stamps and postmarked at Bloudane on the 29th July. Each contained one or more copies of a printed circular headed in large type ' The Party ot the Free Hejazis,' followed by the words 'The first issue' and a long manifesto appealing to the Hejazis to exert themselves to expel their Saudi rulers, who as instruments of British Imperialism, had expelled the country's rightful rulers and were busily engaged in sucking the country dry and oppressing it m many ways. I enclose herein the text of the manifesto with a summary translation. It appears that the Saudi authorities were vigilant enough to intercept all these circular manifestoes. The French Minister was informed about them and is understood to be taking appropriate action with the authorities m Syria. Sheilm Yusuf, in drawing my attention to the seriousness of this form of propaganda, endeavoured to prove that such a document bore obvious traces of Hashimite authorship, and said that it was his firm opinion that the Amir Abdullah, tor whom he expressed the greatest dislike, was the real author of the circular. I made it plain to him, however, that I personally could not see that his suspicions about the Amir Abdullah were supported by any actual evidence. 3. On the 21st August the Qaim Maqam of Jedda brought to me a long document which he had received from the Amir Feisal. ^ His Excellency instructed to communicate to me the contents of a letter which, he said, had been intercepted. The original was with the King. What he then read to me was a copy • it purported to be a letter from the Amir Abdullah to the well-known pan-Arab propagandist. Sheikh Kamil-ul-Qassab, who, it will be remembered, paid a visit to His Majesty at Riyadh in the summer of 1937 with the object of persuading the King to intervene openly on the side of the Arabs m 1 alestine. A summary of the contents of the letter in translation is enclosed. It wi e seen that the writer of the letter lays down certain desiderata for the good government of this country. His Majesty was evidently excessively annoyed at reading these criticisms of his system of government, and the Amir reisa instructed the Qaim Maqam to protest to me most vigorously against t e intervention which the Amir Abdullah was making in the internal anairs oi a foreign State. I replied that all I could do was to communicate tne letteiand His Royal Highness's remarks to your Lordship, and to send a copy to the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan in case he could throw any light on the matter. I am also sending to the High Commissioner a copy of the^ actual Arabic text of the letter said to have been sent by the Amir Abdullah m case it may be possible for him to form an opinion on the genuineness of the from the Arabic style in which it is composed. I am sending to your Lordship a summary translation only of the Amir's letter, as it is full of historical references, and other anfractuosities. In his letter of instructions the Amir Feisal made the point that the similarity between the expressions in the latter [705 n—3] 's iv P 07tBWBM * n ■x i j i part of the letter and those used in the manifesto supported the Saudi theory that the Amir Abdullah was responsible for the letter. I must confess, however, that there is in my view no very obvious connexion between them. 4. These matters serve to illustrate and emphasise the Saudi-Hashimite feud which appears at present to be one of the main preoccupations of the King. During the recent visit of the Amir Feisal to Jedda I elicited from His Royal Highness the fact that he felt that one or two questions which had been referred to His Majesty's Government for decision or for advice had not yet been dealt with : and when I pressed him for details he said that he was not referring to such routine questions as Koweit (though he would be very grateful to get these settled) but that he was thinking more particularly of the letter from His Majesty which had been communicated to Sir R. Bullard at Taif last June. I imagine that His Majesty's way of looking at the matter is as follows. He feels that the Hashimites are being allowed to intrigue against him. The limits of his patience have been reached. Therefore he wants one of two things ; either that His Majesty's Government should declare their policy towards him in such a way as to ward off these attacks (which implies a hint that by appropriate representa tions to Nuri Pasha, the Amir Abdullah and others we could stop the anti-Saudi campaign if we tried); or that His Majesty's Government should agree to give him a free hand in retaliating. But hitherto His Majesty's Government have not dealt with the King's dilemma. And now the campaign of anti-Saudi propaganda seems to be gaining strength. The news that Nuri Pasha blocked the ratification of two of the agreements signed at Rivadh in July, together with the constant newspaper reports that Abdullah is a most favoured candidate for the Syrian throne, have irritated His Majesty bevond measure. As an instance of recent newspaper reports I may cite the Cairo Illustrated paper AI Lataif-al- Musawara of the 7th August; on its front page was a large picture of the Amir Abdullah headed ^ The new Arab King.' That paper is popular here but I hear that the issue of 7th August was confiscated by the postal authorities on arrival. 5. Such is, in my opinion, the King's attitude at present, and, though I see no sign of His Majesty's relaxing his fixed policy of referring to His Majesty's Government any question in which they are interested or in which he would like His Majesty's Government's advice (on the contrary I think that policy has been even more prominent than usual this summer), T am sure that the Kino- would welcome any help which His Majesty's Government might feel able to give him with regard to the suppression of anti-Saudi propaganda by anv means which may be withm His Majesty's Government's power. ^ am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's representatives at Cairo and Bagdad; to the Middle East Intelligence Centre at Cairo; to His Majesty s High Commissioner at Jerusalem; to His Majesty's consular officers at Beirut and Damascus To Damascus only I am sending the original cover of some of the circulars from Bloudane, in case they may help him to trace the real origin of these pamphlets.

(Salutations.) I WAS very pleased to receive your letter dated at Damascus, 3rd JumadaT ula, 1358. You mention that my letter has reminded you of the time when we used to talk so much together about the future of the Arab nation. You say that I am well aware that you were the first person to develop the idea of uniting the Arabs, and that you put this idea before His late Majesty more than once when you were in Mecca, begging him to communicate with the Arab Princes and offering yourself as an intermediary. The late King was not inspired to adopt the idea, but, nevertheless, we are grateful to you for your efforts. (Here follows a recapitulation of the history of the Arab revolt against the lurks, the prominent part played therein by the addressee; King Hussein's attitude towards Ibn Saud, the Idrisi and British interests in Arabia at that time.) Regarding your proposal that, should the moment be opportune, we should make a general pact with the Saudi Kingdom, the Yemen and Iraq of such a nature as to guarantee the independence of these States and of Transjordan, in which proposal (you say) you have no doubt that His Majesty King Ibn'Saud will assist us, he being so sincere in his piety and devotion to the national cause, I tnank you warmly and declare that I am perfectly prepared to follow your advice on condition that you request His Majesty in your name and in the name of the religion and nationalism to which he is so devoted to institute general reforms m the Hejaz and Nejd by granting a Constitution such as will ensure a regular constitutional Administration in the country, as in Iraq and Transjordan^ and will protect the people's liberties, draw up a public budget, set up a Ministryi responsible to a general Assembly, organise ^. defens ^® a ™['Xv blTreafa^d up a proper machinery of government.

In the past month something like half a million riyals have been brought into Bahrain and exchanged here for rupees, while at the same time heavy exports of rupees have been made to Kuwait, whence presumably they will find their way into the northern part of Hasa. The Saudi Government buy back these riyals through the Eastern Bank, and as there is no prohibition so far on the export of rupees (coins) from India, I suppose all this does not matter very much. Nevertheless I understand it is a fact that the riyal has nothing like the same silver content as the rupee, and it is not altogether desirable that the Manama bazaar should be flooded with these coins.

I HAVE the honour to submit a brief report on the situation as seen at Jedda. 2. The German attempt to represent the visit of Khalid-al-Gargani, the envoy of Ibn Saud. to Berlin as having great political significance did them more harm than good in the eyes of Ibn Saud, who has no wish to be tied to Hitler's chariot and to fly from known to unknown evils. It was reasonable that he should try to obtain from the Germans arms which we could not supply, especially if they were willing to grant favourable credits. Ibn Saud communicated to His Majesty's Government the correspondence in which his envoy related the progress of the negotiations with the Germans, and requested their advice when the Germans asked for a neutrality agreement in return for the facilities promised. The advice being rather long in coming, he on his own initiative sent a polite refusal to enter into a neutrality agreement. It is interesting to learn that the Germans hastened to accept Ibn Sand's point of view. Unless the correspondence communicated to us has been falsified (and there is no reason to believe this), Ibn Saud told the Germans openly that his interests prevented his taking any step which would involve him in difficulties with His Majesty's Government. The outbreak of war brought the negotiations to an end, and on the 13th September Ibn Saud sent Khalid a telegram instructing him to return home. Khalid had not enough money for the return journey, and as Ibn Saud considered it impossible to send money to Germany, he instructed Khalid to go to some neutral country, preferably Switzerland, where he could receive money from Saudi Arabia for the journey home. Khalid is said to be due here soon, but I have no official information on that point. 3. As Mr. Trott reported to you at the time, towards the end Khalid gained the impression that the Germans were not anxious to supply the arms in any case. If the Germans expected hostilities to break out soon, that might well be the case : they would need all the arms they could get; Ibn Saud could not be relied upon not to be sympathetic towards their enemy. Great Britain; and the foreign exchange to be paid for the arms in instalments would probably never reach them. Later, however, they seem to have been keen to supply the arms, and the agreement was signed. Ibn Saud, however, seems to have taken it for granted that the outbreak of war destroyed all hope of his getting the arms. I have received your telegram No. 126, dated the 13th September, in which it is stated that if the Germans are still willing to supply the arms without unacceptable conditions, His Majesty's Government see no reason why Ibn Saud should not take advantage of the offer, though as to the method of payment, about which His Majesty's Government could make suggestions, they would deprecate the transfer of gold to Germany. The agreement, a copy of which was transmitted in Mr. Trott's secret letter of the 6th September to Mr. Baxter, provides for the sale of 10,000 Mauser rifles complete and 10 million cartridges for the sum of £119,962 3^., c.i.f. Jedda, payment to be made in seven equal instalments at dates from four to seventy-six months after delivery of the goods. 4. It was to be expected that when the German Minister was handed his passports by the Iraq Government he would try to make for Saudi Arabia, where from the shelter of his other legation he might be a thorn in the side of the Allies, and, in fact, he applied to Ibn Saud for permission to travel to Saudi Arabia by land from Najaf, with several cars. Ibn Saud did not want to have Dr. Grobba [730 s—2] EASTERN (A rabia) BUSHiREn|P^55X] No CONFIDENTIAL. ! Dsfo.in his country at all. He. could not refuse to receive him altogether, since Dr. Grobba is accredited to him, but he found a good excuse for refusing to allow him to come by land : he alleged that the tribes on the route, excited by the talk of hostilities, and particularly by the news that Iraq had entered the war, migiit make some regrettable mistake. It was expected here that after reaching Syria, Dr. Grobba would make an attempt to reach Jedda by sea, but I have no news of his movements or intentions. 5. The situation in Jedda is much more tranquil at present than I had reason to expect a year ago. It seemed almost certain that Italy would be against us if we went to war with Germany, and this would have turned Jedda into a centre of propaganda and brought the war much nearer to Ibn Saud. Moreover, at that time it was not foreseen that a conference would result in the adoption by His Majesty's Government of a Palestine policy which not even the Arab extremists could deny to be an improvement from their point of view, and which would enable the Arab States to side with us whole-heartedly in case of a European war. The Italian wireless broadcasts are carefully neutral and the Italian Legation are not distributing any objectionable propaganda. Among certain sections of the populace the violent German broadcasts, professing love for the Arabs and disinterested wishes for their independence and their liberation from the Jews, are not without effect, but on the other hand, it is the pilgrimage that matters to Jedda and, indeed, to Saudi Arabia as a whole, and for that the country is largely dependent on Great Britain and not at all on Germany. Moreover, public opinion here has little or no effect upon Ibn Saud. who steers his own course. 6. Ibn Saud defined his attitude in a message, which was reported in the last paragraph of Jedda telegram No. 119, dated the 3rd September. In this message Ibn Saud assures His Majesty's Government that he would never give any undertaking or take any secret or open action with any Moslem or (other) foreign Government which might damage British interests or affect his relations with His Majesty's Government. This assurance is of a piece with Ibn Sand's policy for many years past. He does not claim that he has any greater affection for us than any other non-Moslem foreigners, but only that his interests are in essence identical with ours. 7. It is early to say what course the war will take. The attitude of Italy and Turkey must naturally be of great concern to Ibn Saud, and what policy they will eventually adopt is at present unknown. All that can be said is that for the moment the task of His Majesty's Legation in Jedda is easier than I expected it would be. Ibn Saud is impatient to see me to discuss matters of common interest, and in my telegram No. 123, dated the 13th September, I suggested that, in the first place, I should pay him a visit at Riyadh; as an alternative, he seems much to prefer to a suggestion that Captain de Gaury should visit him. It was I who originally proposed that if war broke out it might serve the interests of His Majesty's Government well if Ibn Saud would allow us to have a representative at Riyadh, and suggested Captain de Gaury as the ideal officer for this purpose, but from the comments of Ibn Saud, some received before and some after the despatch of my telegram No. 123, it is evident that if this project is still desirable, and is ever to be realised, it requires preparation by a visit from the Minister at Jedda, which, as Ibn Saud says, would be generallv considered natural and not, like a visit from Captain de Gaury, a highly abnormal event. I am expecting to receive at any moment your instructions whether I am to go to Riyadh. 8. The Foreign Office were aware, before I left England, that Ibn Saud had decided to establish a legation in Paris and that Fuad Hamza had been selected for this post. My French colleague, M. Ballereau, who is as active as his predecessor was supine, claims that this step has been taken as a result of his insistence. He declares that the Quai d'Orsay do not understand the Arab point of view, and that he urged upon the Saudi Government their responsibility to enlighten the French Government on this subject. It is more than probable that Ibn Saud s main object is to urge the claims of his family to the ! hrone of Syria and to counteract the influence of the Shereefian family, but M. Ballereau. whether conscious of that fact or not, did not allude to it. But whatevei is behind the appointment, it can hardly fail to be advantageousto the Allies that the only legations maintained by Ibn Saud abroad should all be in Allied countries—Great Britain, France, Egypt and Iraq. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, his Excellency the Governor-General of the Sudan, his Excellency the Governor of Aden Colony, the Political Agents at Bahrein and Koweit. the Commissioner at Port Sudan, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre at Cairo.

Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received Nooemher 9.) (No. 150.) My Lord, Jedda, October 24, 1939. DURING my recent visit to Riyadh I sent brief telegrams on the various matters discussed, and on my return to Jedda I have the honour to submit some general remarks, in the light of my visit, on the relations at this critical moment between His Majesty's Government and Tbn Saud. 2. I found the King not at all inclined to sit on the fence, waiting to see how the war in Europe would go, but outspoken in his sympathy for the Allies and anxious to do all he could to ensure that there should be nothing to prevent the Arabs of the territories with which Great Britain and France have special relations from co-operating with them. One of the first remarks of the Amir Saud (in the presence of an American doctor, too) was : '' We are on the side of the Allies,' and he said something of the same kind when I called on him to say good-bye; but his father was just as outspoken. Nor has Ibn Saud been content with assurances to us. Apart from his general support in the Palestine question and his remarkable frankness in communicating to us over the last two years some at least of the particulars of negotiations with Iraq, Italy, Japan and Germany, we have recent evidence of his decision not to proceed, while the war lasts, with the negotiations for the supply of arms and ammunition from Germany, and of his consent to receive a representative of His Majesty s Govern ment to reside at Riyadh for a considerable time. 3. Ibn Saud's' desire that His Majesty's Government should be on the winning side in the present war agrees with the tenor of his previous words and acts, but is none the less satisfactory, in view of the relative insignificance of the material help we have been able to give him in contrast to the greater generosity (as it might seem) of the Italians and, more recently, the Germans, in letting him have, in part at low prices and in part as a gift, arms and ammunition which he badly needs and which we are unable to furnish on any terms. Ibn Saud estimates Danaan gifts at their true value, and accepts them without illusions. On the other hand, we know, from copies of correspondence which he has shown us, that he has not secured the German arms by protestations of exclusive friendship. He seems to have told the Germans flatly that his interests weie too closely connected with those of His Majesty's Government for him to adopt a policy hostile to their interests, and in the end to have forced the Germans to accept the position and to sign the agreement for the supply of arms without insisting on the condition that Ibn Saud should agree to observe neutiality in case of any dispute which might arise between Germany and Great Britain. So eager were the Germans to conciliate Ibn Saud that, after the outbieak of wai, Herr Woermann gave Khalid-al-Qarqani, the King s envoy, an official icttei offering to supplv the arms now, to be exported to Jedda on a Nethei lands steamei at Saudi risk, or to hold them, in the safe-keeping of the German Government, at the disposal of His Majesty. The King decided, however, not to proceed with the transaction during the war. He was grateful to His Majesty s Govemment for the suggestions as to the best means to overcome the difficulties oi finance, but he felt that the political objections were insuperable. He feared that, if the arms were shipped to him, the fact would be used as a basis foi exaggeiated claims bv the Germans, whose wireless propaganda about Khalid s visit to Beilin will be remembered, and that his action might be misinterpreted^ in Aiab countries and elsewhere. This decision is satisfactory to His Majesty s Go^em- ment, who do not wish to see even £120,000 in gold or free exchange pass into German hands. With characteristic frankness, Ibn Saud did not claini that political considerations alone underlay his decision; on the contrary, he said with a grin that after the war German arms might be going for nothing. Nevertheless, [755 i—2] Sf Copy No. 1^5I am sure that he did not wish to give the German cause even the small fillip that the confirmation of the order might have given it. t , - i- u 4. It might be expected that Ibn Sand, as a dictator himself, would sympathise with the totalitarian States, but that is not so. Ibn Sand does not regard himself as a dictator of the Hitler order, but as a monarch limited by the precepts of the Quran, On one occasion he accepted as correct a suggestion I made that he ruled under a ' religious constitution. To him ere is a fundamental difference between the theocracy of feaudi Arabia and the depotism, tempered neither by the fear of God nor readiness to listen to human advice, of a man like Hitler. But he frankly says that Hitler is mad, and quotes an Arabic proverb which affords a close parallel to Quem deus vult peideie. As a nnal proof of Hitler's madness Ibn Sand cites the pact with Soviet Eussia, which he believes will be one of the causes of Germany's downfall. His own hostility to Soviet Russia is intense. Self-interest, injured by the cessation of the stream of pilgrims from ]V^Eosl6in commuiiitiGS now iindGr Soviet rule, niciy hcive something to do with this, but Ibn Saud also dislikes a rule which can find no room for the religion and the social system of Islam. The prolonged negotiations between Soviet Russia and Turkey gave him acute anxiety. His suspicions of Tuikey, as nursing an undying grudge against the Arabs, are well known to His Majesty's Government, and it was not surprising that he should imagine Soviet Russia as offering Turkey a free hand to the south in return for a free hand for Russia in the ^Balkans The news of the signature of the pact between Great Britain, France and Turkey, which arrived just before I left Riyadh, did something to reassure His Majesty. 5. Having taken up an attitude of neutrality so benevolent towards the Allies it is natural that Ibn Saud should desire that Palestine should cease to be a cause of irritation to the Arab world. Although he ridicules German propaganda as overdone, he fears lest the Arabic broadcasts from Berlin, conducted with vitriolic skill and force by such people as Yunus Bahri, may have some effect on Arab minds, and he considers that the restoration of peace in Palestine and some form of open support by the Palestinian Arabs for the Allied cause would be the greatest blow to Germany. I found him still in the stage of the armistice-amnesty idea. One can understand that, having no obligations of alliance towards His Majesty's Government such as those of Iraq and Egypt, he should be unwilling to make yet another appeal to the Palestinian Arabs unless he has something to offer. Nevertheless, he accepted the statement which I gave him, based on Foreign Office telegram No. 133 of the 2nd October, explaining the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the Mufti and towards a possible appeal by the Arab States to the people of Palestine. He conveyed this statement to Jamal-al-Husaini, who was then in Riyadh, and telegraphed it to his representative in Bagdad, with the suggestion that Iraq should approach Egypt and he himself the Imam of the Yemen, with a view to concerted action to bring about peace in Palestine. 6. We need have no fear that Saudi Arabia may become a centre for anti- British intrigue during the war. Anti-British broadcasts will be listened .to. but only in private houses; wireless broadcasts in coffee-shops are not permitted, and a Royal decree forbids the populace to discuss the international situation, with which, it says, they have no concern. The ground for the decree is stated therein to be the inherent unsuitability of the Holy Land of Islam for propaganda. This decree suits His Majesty's Government very well, since we cannot compete with our enemies in vituperation. Dr. Grobba, who, on having to leave Iraq, wanted to make for Riyadh by land, was deflected from his purpose by an ingenious excuse, and Ibn Saud told me with great vehemence that he knew Dr. Grobba only wanted to engage in propaganda, and that he was resolved not to have him in Riyadh at any cost. We know that Ibn Saud also refused to allow Dr. Ruwaiha, the doctor to the German Legation in Bagdad, to come to Saudi Arabia. He showed me a number of papers about Mizhir-al-Shawi, whose journey from Iraq to Saudi Arabia had excited suspicion; they tended to show that the main, if not the only, reason for the journey was to escape vengeance or punishment for a tribal murder, and proved in any case that Ibn Saud was keeping a close watch on the man. He declared with great vehemence that he was entirely opposed to having to receive the Mufti in his territory—a man whom he despises as a shifty self-seeker. Jamal-al-Husaini, who had gone to Riyadh from Bagdad to see him, was received in audience onlyonce (so the King said), and then only to be told the latest decision of His Majesty's Government about the Mufti and the Palestine situation, and to be dismissed back to Bagdad; and when, just after Jamal's departure, Ibn Saud learned through me that Jamal was considered by the High Commissioner of Palestine to have invented and spread abroad unfounded tales of ill-treatment of returning Palestinian refugees by the Palestine authorities, he telegraphed to his representative in Bagdad in very strong terms, to urge Jamal and the Mufti not to engage in any propaganda or other activities against Great Britain, as that would be ruinous to the Arab world. 7. It was after this that Ibn Saud went over with me the history of his efforts in connexion with Palestine during the last year. He claimed that if, some little while after the issue of the white paper, hostilities in Palestine died down, it was partly owing to his efforts, and he instructed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to show me the correspondence. Sheikh Yusuf produced a sheaf of corres pondence, direct and indirect, between the King and the Syrian and Palestinian leaders. It began with a letter to the Saudi Consul in Damascus, through whom, together with Bashir-al-Sadawi, Ibn Saud was in touch with the leaders. This letter was rather on the lines of the letter from Ibn Saud to Nuri Pasha, which the latter showed, perhaps in a mutilated form, to many Arabs, in an effort, it would seem, to discredit Ibn Saud as anti-Arab. It advised the Arab leaders to become reconciled to Great Britain and France, lest the British and French Governments should grow tired of unceasing opposition and join with the Turks and the Jews against the Arabs; and suggested that if only the question of Palestine could be settled, a solution of the Syrian problem would follow. I was shown individual replies from Jamil Mardom and Shukri Quwatli and a joint letter signed by them and five others. Shukri served as go-between with the Mufti. It is not necessary to take at their face value the protestations in these letters, promising to be guided by the King's advice, but the correspondence did show what efforts the King was making in the interests of peace in Palestine— not, he was as anxious as ever to explain, to give pleasure to His Majesty's Government, but because he felt it essential in the interests of all Arabs. His interest in Syria was doubtless prompted in part by his desire to obtain French support for the Amir Faisal as a candidate for the Syrian Throne. 8. Ibn Saud showed no sign of wanting anything from His Majesty's Government in these days. He is not of the blackmailing type, and he would probably admit that the defeat of Germany, whom he regards as a danger to Islam and to the East in general, will be a reward in itself for his benevolent neutrality. He seemed grateful for such action as we have been able to take to temper the wind of war to his country. His immediate preoccupation in these days is the pilgrimage, which, as a result of war conditions, is likely to be a small one and so to affect his budget and to arouse discontent in the Hejaz. I was able to give him some consolation by reporting that the resumption of sailings of Indian pilgrim ships was being actively considered, and by reminding him of the very helpful attitude of the Government of India on the matter of the export of food-stuffs to Saudi Arabia. I also told him that we were appealing to Egypt to allow the export of certain machinery parts required by the gold mine at Mahd, and to Transjordan in connexion with his desire to import food-stuffs from there in spite of the general prohibition of export. But what Ibn Saud valued most was the statement in which His Majesty's Government say that they know of no ground on which the Amir Abdullah could possibly suppose that he is likely to be chosen for the Throne of Syria by the French. His cheerfulness after this statement lends support to his contention that he doesn't want Syria himself, but doesn't want to see a Hashimite there. 9. The proposal that Captain de Gaury, until recently political agent at Koweit, should go to Riyadh as a representative of His Majesty's Legation, threw Ibn Saud into a panic when first broached some weeks ago, but was eventually accepted with manifest pleasure. Having got used, during my visit, to having someone at hand to talk to, the King did not like the idea of my leaving, but he was easily persuaded to accept Captain de Gaury as a substitute. To fill an interval of several weeks I left behind Mr. Wall, who knows Arabic exceedingly well, to serve as liaison officer, and Ibn Saud seemed much pleased with this arrangement. He waved aside the suggestion that other Powers mightwish to have representatives at Riyadh. Who was there ? he asked ^e French wouldn't mind and that left only the Italians, fd hey had no business to speak of that would justify their sending ^^J^h interv ie W 10, When talking -^b^t the course ^^rd ^Ihat that battleship ™urs m had been^unk I felt as though one of my own sons had been drowned.' n woidd be possible to belittle this statement as '''^''^/ke^rtfe'dtSn' perhaps as the remark of a man to whom la son ^nore oHess makes Me d^fierence but I am sure that the utterance was genuine. The King has gone so tar in supporting us that a blow to us is a blow to his own pride and honour. We must win not onlv in our joint interests but to vindicate his reputation as a ^atesman- and he is cheerfully convinced that we shall wm. 11 f am sending copies'of this despatch to His Ma]esty s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre.

IN my telegram No. 153 of the 13th November I reported the approaching departure of Captain de Gaury and Mr. Heber Percy for Riyadh. They left Jedda on the 14th November, and arrived at Riyadh on the 18th. Mr. Wall, whom I left at Riyadh as liaison officer, left for Jedda on the 20th. 2. Enclosed is a copy of the instructions which I gave to Captain de Gaury to take with him. 3. As I reported in the ninth paragraph of my despatch No. 150, dated the 24th October, the King waved aside my suggestion that the presence of a British representative at Riyadh might lead other Powers to ask for the same privilege, but the Italians have, in fact, already raised the question. According to a message from Ibn Saud which I have received through Mr. Wall, the translator of the Italian Legation referred to the journey of Captain de Gaury to Riyadh in a conversation with Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, Minister of Finance, and asked whether the King would allow other Governments to have representatives there; whereupon the King instructed Sheikh Abdullah to let the Italian Minister know, in some suitable manner, that the King himself had asked that a British repre sentative should stay temporarily at Riyadh ' because of the frequent necessity for business discussions in connexion with neighbouring British territories,' and had wanted Sir R. Bullard to stay, but that being impossible. Sir R. Bullard had offered to send someone else as representative and the King had accepted the offer. 4. My French colleague, far from objecting to the presence of a British representative at Riyadh, where France is not represented, declares himself delighted, and has asked whether, in case he should have some message of special importance to send to the King, he may send it through the legation and Captain de Gaury. M. Ballereau is a very good colleague and is anxious to show a united Allied front in this country, and as I share his desire, I am not only exchanging information with him, but have promised to convey to the King any messages with which he may entrust this legation. 5. It is impossible to forecast how long it will be possible to keep Captain de Gaury at Riyadh. If this were a normal year, Ibn Saud would come to Mecca towards the end of December and stay for two months or so, and that would be a signal for Captain de Gaury to leave the King, since he could not go to Mecca, and, in any case, so long as the King is in the Hejaz. it is always possible to arrange an interview for a minister in case of urgency. But it is possible that the King may not come to the Hejaz this year : this would be an obvious economy, in cost of transport and of hospitality to distinguished pilgrims, for the King to make while his finances are straitened. If he does not come to the Hejaz, it will be for Captain de Gaury to discover whether his presence is becoming irksome to the King in any way. The object of sending a British representative to reside near the King being to induce the King to maintain a favourable attitude towards us, the arrangement loses its point if it ceases to be agreeable to the King. 6. I am forwarding copies of this despatch, without enclosure, to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [780 t—1]Enclosure. Instructions to Cwptain de Gauvy. Captain de Gaury, IN accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in foreign Office telegram unnumbered of the 11th September, you are proceeding to Riyadh to reside there as the personal representative of His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, in order to be in a position to supply His Majesty King Abdul Aziz day by day with first-hand information, and also to act as liaison officer with the legation. Mr. Heber Percy will accompany you as your assistant. ^ 2. The Foreign Office have arranged that you should have the local rank of first secretary, and Mr. Heber Percy that of honorary attache, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are being informed accordingly in a letter of which a copy is attached.Q 3. As you are aware, the object of the plan by which you are to reside at Riyadh is to help to consolidate the good relations between His Majesty's Govern ment and the King, and to ensure his remaining friendly to us during the war. This being so, there would be no point in your staying at Riyadh if it appeared that your presence was becoming irksome to His Majesty in any way. Please keep this in mind and let me know for the information of His Majesty's Govern ment how the plan works in practice. If the King comes to the v Hejaz for the pilgrim season, as he usually does, it will be natural for you to return to Jedda, at any rate for a time, since, when the King is at Mecca, it is always possible to arrange an interview with him. 4. Any dangerous dogs that are sleeping should be allowed to sleep on, e.g., Khor-el-Odeid, and I trust that you will also be able to damp down any fresh questions that arise that do not seem to call for action. On the other hand, where, as in the case of the islands between Bahrein and the mainland, there is a possibility that friction may arise, please inform the legation at once so that His Majesty's Government may be warned in time. 5. The principal objections raised by the Sheikh of Koweit to the King's counter-proposals for the Trade Agreement have been received by telegram and communicated to you so that you will be able to discuss them with the King at once. There is, however, a despatch on the way which may contain other points. 6. During my visit to Riyadh last month I kept a full diary giving the essential parts of all talks with the King and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and any items of news that I managed to pick up. I should be glad if you would keep a similar record and send me a copy of the current portion whenever there is an opportunity.

THE foreign policy of this country, that is to say, of Ibn Saud, has been fully dealt with in despatches written since my recent return from Riyadh and a brief note on the armed forces of Saudi Arabia is being sent by this bag. I now have the honour to submit a short report on the internal situation, to round on the position of Saudi Arabia before leaving for another post. ! here is little m it that has not been said before in despatches from Jedda. 2 Few countries in the world can have a better record for the maintenance of law and order than Saudi Arabia has at the present time. The only crime ot violence that I have heard of for months was a case of rape and murder, wliich was recently punished at Riyadh by the execution of three men m the public square. Theft and robbery continue to be punished with a Quranic seventy which makes the immunity enjoyed by highly-placed embezzlers of public moneys rather repulsive. What is most remarkable is the complete suppression ox the tribal raid and blood-feud. There is no evidence of the effect which this is havmg or may have in the long run. ft may be suppressing feelings which will bieak out as soon as the hand of Ibn Saud is weakened or removed. It must be causmg an increase of population, which sooner or later must find a livelihood out. the narrow limits of desert pasturage. The oil industry in ^® sa ^3 ^ f r JJ considerable number (I believe that it already employs over and attempts are being made to utilise existing water supplies to f to find fresh ones, so that there may be a demand for more cultivators. How fa the new opportunities for making a livelihood will keep pace with the expected orowth in the population must be a matter of speculation. 3 I have reported more than once, as a matter for regret, the weakness of Ibn Saud's regime in the matter of administration. Ihe King is evidently a past-master mdesert politics and in the maintenance of aw and order even in places so unruly as Asir. and. in spite ot his !ac „ k / f .P® rs °^^ v e ^S ®'^ egs the outside world he grapples with the problems of foreign policy with success.

Over a year ago I suggested that the gradual replacement of income from the pilgrimage by oil royalties, paid direct into a bank abroad by a foreign company, as the main item in the State revenue, should increase the independence of the crown, but this process has been interrupted by the war. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company are confident that the Hasa oil-field is going to be one of the most important in the world, and that it will not be long before Ibn Saud receives from it much more than he ever received from pilgrims, but the increase in the revenue from oil royalties, plus the lump sum received for the new concession granted to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company this year, has been more than offset by the war slump in the pilgrimage, and Ibn Saud has just obtained from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company an advance of a million dollars on account of future royalties. No one, except the King and one or two others, know what the financial situation of Saudi Arabia really is and, above all, whether there is a considerable reserve at home 6r abroad, but the impression made on me is that the King's cheerfulness about his finances is due to his belief that the war will not last more than another six months or so, and that, if the low figures of this pilgrimage should be repeated next year and perhaps the year after, Ibn Saud might be in serious financial straits. The Minister of Finance is said to have urged the King to have economies made in the public departments, and to have proposed that the King should not come to Mecca this season, but economise in transport and entertaining by staying at home. There was little sign of economy when I was in Riyadh, but it is stated that the King has, in fact, agreed to the division of all estimates into urgent and non urgent and to have ordered the latter to be suspended. 5. It is unfortunate from the moral point of view that the new form of revenue in this country is almost as demoralising as the old. The exploitation of pilgrims is not an elevating means of livelihood, but it is also demoralising to draw a large revenue from a natural product whose extraction depends entirely upon the technical and organising skill of foreigners. But just as fate has given Saudi Arabia a perfect monopoly in the possession of the shrine at Mecca, so it has given them a share in the limited quantity of oil in the world, and one cannot expect tnem to worry about its effect on their character. I am toid that the demoralising effect of easy oil money on the Saudis is already apparent, in that whereas ten years ago the rent of 5,000 gold pounds was counted out with the greatest care, to-day an expenditure of 50,000 gold pounds is con sidered nothing. But the estect is visible to any observer at Riyadh, where there is a strong contrast between the poverty of the common people and the sprawling waste and extravagance of the Royal households. The huge new palace, built )y the King himself without any proper plan, is typical of evervthin^. It is said that 2,000 or 3,000 people feed at the King's expense, and this is probably not an overstatement. There are the brothers and uncles and cousins, and the Kashids, and the twenty-five or more princes and their unnumbered sisters, each one the nucleus of a group of idle servants and slaves and expensive cars, and the men with wives and concubines in addition. And there is no education or mora i aming or experience to keep a check on the indulgence in pleasure and or.

It is impossible to know whether any community of feeling is growing up between—say the Saudi tribes near Koweit and the once-turbulent population in Asir. Probably not. But it can be stated with certainty that there is no community of feeling between the Hejaz towns and Nejd. ' The King speaks with a contempt which must be admitted to be well deserved of the people of the Hejaz, and while he claims to rule with the approval of Nejd, he cares nothing for Hejazi approval. It is probable, however, that no ruler'would be popular in the Hejaz who did not leave to the Hejazis their traditional liberty to exploit the pilgrims for their own advantage. The necessity to find money to subsidise the Nejd tribes, both to induce them to refrain from raids and to be ready to wage war for the King in case of need, has driven Ibn Saud to raise pilgrim dues to unprecedented heights, and not only does he leave the pilgrim little to spend in the Hejaz, but he represses the grosser forms of extortion by which the Hejazi might still squeeze a living out of the ' respected guests of the Holy Land.' The Hejazi likes to regard himself as exploited by Nejdis, Syrians and other ' foreigners,' and for this view there is some justifica tion. Whether the Hejaz, if independent, could support and defend itself is doubtful, but the Hejazi will think of the evil from which flight at present seems impossible rather than of the alternative ills. It would be sufficient for a pretender to the throne to promise a lowering of pilgrim dues and to hint at a freer hand for pilgrim guides, for him to win much popularity. As I have suggested before, it is conceivable that Hasa and Nejd may one day be the richer half of the peninsula, but whether that would induce the Hejaz to desire to maintain the present connexion would depend upon the policy of the Govern ment. Should Ibn Saud live long enough, and should the oil revenue increase as it is expected to do, it would be possible for him to create for the Hejaz such favourable conditions that even the Hejazis might realise their value. The dues on pilgrims would be so greatly reduced that the visitors would be able once more to spend largely in the Hejaz to the benefit of the local people, while the menace of the desert tribes would be kept in check by subsidies paid out of the royalties from Hasa oil. Whether such a situation, which would help towards the unification of the peninsula, would be allowed to develop in peace, would depend largely on the attitude of the northern neighbours of Saudi Arabia, and at present there is little evidence that the rulers of Iraq and Transjordan wish to see a strong, united and independent State on their southern borders. 7.

IN any country where the power is concentrated in the hands of a personal ruler the extent to which his word can be relied upon is a matter of supreme importance to the foreign representative who is called upon to deal with him. We have assurances from Ibn Saud which, taken at their face value, lead us to believe that we can count upon his benevolent neutrality in this war—unless, as I have frequently said, the Allies should be defeated, when at the last moment he might well try to absorb some of the smaller Arab States on the Persian Gulf in order to forestall a similar advance from Iraq or Iran. On the other hand, when the war began the Amir Abdullah seems to have believed that Ibn baud was threatening his territory, and although the Amir subsequently stated that lie was satisfied on this head, it is always possible that the recent movement of Saudi forces to the north may revive his suspicions. It seems probable that the movement is towaids the Iraq frontier, however, and some local wiseacres forecast an attempt to seize Koweit while His Majesty's Government are busy elsewhere. The fact that an emissary of Ibn Sand's visited Herr Hitler just before war broke out was bound to give rise to speculation. The Germans gave the visit a political tinge in their news, and Ibn Saud was not in a position to divulge to the world the information he gave to His Majesty's Government about the object of the visit. Hence a belief in some circles in Jedda (the Turkish Legation, for instance, who have little direct contact with Ibn Saud) that the Saudi Government are pro-German. 2. My own belief is that, if we take Ibn Sand's assurances at their face value, we shall not be far out. The behaviour of Iraq in the matter of Koweit early this year, the assumption of a sort of moral protectorate over the smaller Arab States in the Gulf by certain political and journalistic circles in Iraq, and the conduct of Nuri Pasha as seen through the eyes of Ibn Saud, are sufficient to account for the despatch of Saudi forces towards the Iraq border, even if the King had not had trouble there from tribes which, he believes, try to play off the two Governments against each other. I do not believe that he would welcome a German victory, even if Germany had not allied herself with Russia. The attitude which he has held towards His Majesty's Government during the three years I have been here seems to me consistent with his wider interests. His attitude was well described to my French colleague recently by Fuad Hamza, who said that the King would never quarrel with His Majesty's Government about the Mufti, for instance, for while it was a Moslem and Arab interest for him to support the Palestinian claim, he considered that the wider interests of the Arab and Moslem world compelled him to remain close friends with His Majesty's Government. 3. Ibn Saud has never pretended that his attitude towards His Majesty's Government is due to mere affection. He claims, for instance, to have told the Hadhramis, who came fishing for sympathy, that if the British were not in the Hadhramaut some other Power would be, and that they might think themselves fortunate to have secured the best of the Powers.. He has often said that, as an Arab, he sympathises with any movement for Arab independence, but next to independence he considers British rule or protection to be the least galling arrangement. When justifying his support for Great Britain in the East, he points to the independence of Iraq and Egypt and the constitutional development in India, saying that, while His Majesty's Government have doubtless acted in accordance with their conception of their own interests, no other European Power would have shown such consideration to the peoples concerned. Finally, he alwavs [780 y 2]asserts that his friendship with His Majesty's Government is based on his convic tion that his own country stands or falls with Great Britain. It would be possible, of course, for a statesman, and not merely an oriental statesman, to create and maintain this attitude as a facade, and behind it to be working for our undoing, but I think that the King's actions for the last few years are sufficient to dispose of this hypothesis. There was reason to believe that when the Palestine revolt was at its worst he was persuaded into agreeing to let the malcontents have some rifles and ammunition, but when one realises what pressure must have been put upon him, by the Arabs and by his own religious convictions, one hesitates to judge this harshly, especially when one remembers the efforts he had made to keep the peace while the question was being studied, and the advice he had frequently given to His Majesty's Government to move in a direction in which, with the issue of the White Paper of 1939, they have now moved. The perfect friend would, of course, have refused all help to the Palestinians and, if necessary, risked his own position, but I consider Ibn Saud comparatively, as he considers His Majesty's Government, and 1 find him, as he finds us, able to stand comparison. In particular, after reading some ten years of the Persia print as a preparation for a new post, my opinion of Ibn Sand's qualities has gone up rather than down. 4. Ibn Saud has certain grave faults. His attitude towards slavery, and especially towards women slaves, is difficult to excuse; his treatment of his huge family of sons is unwise and must lead to embarrassment, if not in his own time, in the reign of his successor; and his indifference to the financial side of administration is a serious defect in a ruler. But, on the whole, he has shown himself a great ruler. No man who had not had a firm hold over himself, as well as over his people, could have steered the course in regard to Palestine which he has steered for the last two or three years. It is not that he is cynical : the depths of his personal feelings could not be doubted by anyone who had heard him repeat some of the Quranic texts about the Jews, or seen him trying to suppress his tears at the wireless announcement of the hanging of an Arab for participation in the armed movement in Palestine; but he is not led away by his feelings, but keeps his eyes fixed steadfastly on the main lines of the policy which he has adopted. I do not think that the possession of a certain greatness of mind can be denied him. 5. I am aware that there are English men and women who ' adopt ' some foreign country whose real or alleged virtues they never cease to praise, and whose interests they support exclusively, and that I risk being classed in this respect with the Aubrey Herberts, the Miss Durhams, and the Gertrude Bells. But no Englishman who has lived within 45 miles of Mecca for five years could have any illusions about the 'noble Arab,' though, perhaps, the exploiters of the pilgrimage have keen competitors in baseness in those Iraqi politicians, who, it appears, sponsor the view in the local school-books that the independence of Iraq was won, not from the Turks by the Allies, but from the British by the Arabs. No, my good opinion of Ibn Saud is not part of an illusion about the Arabs, but is based on my experience of his actions for three years and of some other countries for various periods. For instance, all orientals are supposed to be highly suspicious, but I have found Ibn Saud less suspicious than the French in Morocco; again, the Soviet officials with whom I had to deal for nearly four years serve to elevate the character of Ibn Saud by contrast to a high level of probitv and ^ood faith. 6. The personal relations between Ibn Saud and the British officials with whom he litis been bi ought into contact over a period of nearly thirtv years have been almost uniformly good, and I should be glad to know that my official relations would always be as easy in future as they have been here. I feel a real regret that I have probably had my last talk with ibn Saud, and shall never a^ain listen to one of his long monologues, rambling and repetitive but by no means pointless, and none the less sound on European politics because all foreign names but the most simple are beyond his capacity, so that even the familiar Inghilterra becomes qandara, which in the mouth of any other Arab means ; Czecho-Slovakia is a despairing wave of the hand; and a eertaraMiss O Looney who flits in and out of the talk like some engaging friend of Mr. Flurry Knox s, turns out to be an eminent Italian statesman f _T. Ibn Saud being a firm and capable ruler and. as I think, a loyal friend to His Majesty s Government, it is naturally a matter of great importance howlong his effective rule will last until cut short by death or by incapacity. I can only say that in October this year he seemed less heavy in his movements than a year ago, and that in spite of Mr. Philby's gloomy prognostications I see no sign of mental break-up in him. 8.

Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—{Received November 21.) (No. 154.) My Lord, Jedda, October 29, 1939. AS I informed your Lordship in Jedda telegram No. 135, dated the 16th October, Ibn Saud showed great satisfaction at the statement which I made to him on the lines laid down in Foreign Office telegram No. 140. The statement was read out in Arabic, and at the request of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin a copy of the Arabic was given to him. A copy of the English original is attached. I included the opinion of His Majesty's Government that the letter purporting to have been written by the Amir Abdullah to Sheikh Kamil-al-Qassab, if genuine, was unwise and discourteous, but thought it well to keep in reserve the phrase '' and they will, if necessary, convey their views to the Amir/' 2. The essence of Ibn Saud's reply is given in the second paragraph of my above-mentioned telegram. The King said emphatically that he did not want anything—Syria, Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq or any other territory—outside his own dominions, but he feared lest the addition of Syria either to Iraq or Transjordan should facilitate Hashimite designs against the Hejaz or even Nejd. The King compared his own policy (with apologies for comparing small things with great) with what he conceived to be the policy of His Majesty's Government in Europe; Great Britain wanted a balance of power in Europe, and he wanted a balance of power in the Arab world. So long as no Hashimite became ruler of Syria the Syrians, he said, might choose for themselves what form of govern ment they wanted—whether to remain under mandate or to have a republic, or to choose a king from outside. The will of the people ought, after all, to be taken into consideration. He himself would not wish to retain his kingdom if the people of Nejd did not wish him to do so. As for Abdullah ('saving your presence '), but for the support of the British Government he would not be even Amir of Transjordan for another day. 3. My impression that Ibn Saud was pleased with the statement was borne out by Sheikh Yusuf, who informed me next day that the King had said that all he wanted was to be secure in his own possessions, and had expressed satisfaction at the statement I had made to him (' very pleased indeed ' was the expression used). I see no reason to modify the opinion which I gave in my telegram No. 140, that so far as Ibn Saud is concerned it would be better not to add anything to the statement made to Ibn Saud on the 13th October, but to re-examine the question if either side should continue to push its claims. It would appear from reports from His Majesty's High Commissioner for Trans jordan that the Amir Abdullah has given up any hopes of the Syrian throne that he may have had, while Ibn Saud has renounced any claim to it so long as it is not given to a Hashimite. 4. A copy of the secret despatch on the subject of the letter to Qassab and the Bludan pamphlets, which was addressed by His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Colonial Office on the 29th September, under No. TC/58/39, reached jedda in time for me to receive a telegram from Jedda on the subject before I left Riyadh, and I spoke to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin about the matter. I said that the Lligh Commissioner considered that the Amir Abdullah had had nothing to do with the Bludan pamphlets. As to the letter, I said that not only did the Amir admit he had written it, but he claimed to have written several others to Qassab, and to have written them knowing that Qassab was one of the chief supporters of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in Syria, and that they would infallibly be communicated to him. Sheikh Yusuf was a little taken aback at this, and I thought it well to say that while the letter was unwise and discourteous, as His Majesty's Government had said, Qassab was perhaps something of an [755 x—2]aqent provocateur in carrying on the correspondence and cominunioating it to another party. Eventnaiiy Sheikh Yusuf admitted that had Qassab been an ordinary person his action would have been improper, but he maintained that as Qassab had formerly been in Saudi employ as Director of Education he was 0I1 ly doing his duty in transmitting the correspondence to the King. Any now, said Sheikh Yusuf, His Majesty's Government said the letter was unwise and discourteous; what were they going to do : I pointed to the general assuiance at the end of the statement which I had made on the 13th October, and when Sheikh Yusuf pressed for mention of some specific action I said I thought that His Majesty, as a ruler himself, would realise that His Majesty s Government might not find it convenient to say exactly what action they would take with another ruler in such circumstances. Sheikh \usuf Yasin left that point and said that Ibn Saud was in a difficulty in that the Amir Abdullah, whom the King could easily deal with had the Amir stood alone, had attacked the King from under the segis of the King s friends, the British Government. I said that His Majesty's Government had specifically recognised their responsibility in the statement which I had made. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin then said that they were convinced that the Bludan pamphlets must have been prepared with the know ledge of the Amir Abdullah ; he repeated that the pamphlets were conveyed to Bludan by Fuad-al-Khatib, and suggested that Fuad-al-Khatib even arranged for the printing at the press in Damascus to which the pamphlets had been traced. I said it seemed to me that if the Amir had been behind the pamphlets he would have chosen a less prominent emissary than Fuad-al-Khatib, and I made light of Sheikh Yusuf's argument that the Amir's complicity was established by a similarity between the tenor of the Qassab letter and that of the pamphlets. The tenor of the pamphlets, I argued, was common form; every attempt to stir up a revolution, or internal political discontent, used the argument that someone was enjoying someone else's money. I should have liked to add that the pamphlets might have been written by a Syrian, since they mentioned only the Nejdis as blood-suckers, whereas the Hejazi classes Nejdis and Syrians together in this respect, and has no more use for the greedy and corrupt Syrian Director of Works than for his Nejdi chief, the Minister of Finance. The following day Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that he had conveyed to the King what I had said; the King had listened attentively, but had made no comment. I am certain that Ibn Saud would do more justice than Sheikh Yusuf to my argument that Qassab was asking for trouble. At any rate, when I saw the King a few minutes afterwards, for my final interview, he was as cordial as ever. Indeed, it was then that he made the statement which I have recorded in another despatch, that when he heard of the sinking of the British battleship he felt as though a son of his had been drowned. 5. Since my return to Jedda I have received a copy of the telegram, No. 373, which the High Commissioner at Jerusalem addressed to the Colonial Office on the 21st October. I at once telegraphed instructing Mr. Wall to inform Ibn Saud of the Amir Abdullah's personal assurance that he had no knowledge of the pamphlets until the British Resident brought them to his notice. 6. I notice from the High Commissioner's telegram just quoted that his Excellency is inclined to believe that the relations between the Amir Abdullah and Ibn Saud are definitely improving, and that he cites in evidence the exchange of telegrams about the accident to the Amir Saud and the beginning of Ramadan. I should perhaps share the views of Sir Harold MacMichael, had' not Ibn Saud stated the contrary opinion on this point. In the course of the conversation on the 13th October the King said that, superficially, relations with the Amir Abdullah were friendly: the moment the Amir heard of the accident to the Amir Saud he sent a telegram of condolence; he always did that sort of thing, but it made no difference to his real sentiments and aims. Abdullah's fine words, in fact, butter no parsnips with Ibn Saud. The King probably regards it as inevitable that the Amir Abdullah should resent the loss of the Hejaz to the Hashimites, and should cherish a feeling of revenge for the personal humiliation he suffered when the Hejazi force he nominally led was annihilated by the Wahabis and he himself escaped in his shirt. Moreover, Ibn Saud must feel that his own rule over the Hejaz is not popular. On one occasion during my visit he spoke with contempt of the Hejazis, and I noticed that when he claimed to be ruling with the consent of the people of Nejd he said nothing about the people3 of the Hejaz. The Hejazis are a scurvy lot, who will judge any ruler by the amount of money he lets them make out of the pilgrimage; and as Ibn Saud takes most of the profits of the pilgrimage himself he is bound to be unpopular in the Hejaz. 7. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin referred one day to Hashimite intrigues from Iraq in the days of King Faisal. Faisal, he said, was an intriguer beside whom Abdullah was a child. Abdullah left written evidence against himself all over the place; Faisal never committed himself in writing, but he never ceased to intrigue against Ibn Saud, and the King knew all about it and had never forgotten it. The King has frequently mentioned to me his suspicions of Iraq, though never the alleged intrigues of the late King Faisal. His suspicions attach to living Iraqis, especially Nuri Said, and what with the attitude of Iraq towards Koweit a few months ago, and to Nuri's conduct at various occasions in the matter of Palestine, these suspicions are not unreasonable. On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that there is any foundation for the suspicions of the Iraq Government referred to in the fourth paragraph of Foreign Office telegram No. 138 of 6th October, that Ibn Saud has designs against the Iraq dynasty, unless his recent counter-propaganda about the throne of Syria affords ground for such suspicion. It is believed that Ibn Saud enjoys among the tribal elements of Iraq a personal reputation which the Bagdadi politician or official cannot hope to equal, and that doubtless tends to awaken jealousy, and from jealousy to suspicion is a short step. But according to the telegram from the High Com missioner at Jerusalem, No. 373, of the 21st October, even the Amir Abdullah is now convinced from the reports received from Bedouin visitors to Transjordan that Ibn Saud has no hostile intentions against him. If that is a genuine con viction there is some hope for better relations with Trans jordan, if only what the High Commissioner calls the Amir's almost childish indiscretions can be kept in check, and that may perhaps improve the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 8. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, His IVEajesty s Ambassadors at Cano and Bagdad, and to His Majestv's Consul-General at Beirut. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Statement made to Ibn Saud at Riyadh by His Majesty's Minister on October 13, 1939.

' WITH reference to your Lordship's despatch No. 2231 of the 7th September, I have the honour to report that M. Fuad Hamza called on the President of the Republic on the 4th November and presented to him his letters of credence appointing him Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary in Paris of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. 2. In the course of his speech on that occasion, M. Fuad Hamza said that the honour conferred on him in appointing him Minister did not consist exclusively in the fact that he was thus inaugurating a new era in the relations between France and his country, but also in that the appointment, which was made in such grave circumstances, was a material and manifest proof of the friendship and esteem of his Sovereign for liberal F ranee. Those relations had become closer when His Majesty the King had become pi otectoi of the Ho y Places of Islam and he had extended his kingdom over the greater part of Arabia. France had a large number of Moslem and Arab nationals, which made it necessary, and even indispensable, that the relations between the two countries should be strengthened and based on a sincere friendship and mutual interests^ It was indisputably of great importance that Saudi Arabia was a neighboui o France in her capacity as mandatory Power in Syria and the Lebanon. Racial, cultural and religious, not to mention political and economic, considerations ga\e a special character to the relations between the two countries. 3. In the course of his reply, the President of the Republic said that, as tne traditional friend of Islam, which places so high a value on family unity and the obligations of hospitality, France knew to what extent Mahometans were indebted to him to whom it fell to guard the Holy I laces of th 011 ' faith Wherever her authority extended. France endeavoured to assure to Moslems the means of conforming to the precepts of the Koran. She was well aware of the solicitude with which Saudi Arabia welcomed those who were called to Mecca and to Medina for the accomplishment of the most sacred of their religious duties. France was also bound to His Majesty the King by the mutual interests created by the proximity of their territories. Convinced that the bene i s o i ei y wei only fruitful when combined with those of order, she sought to place on solid foundations the prosperity of Syria and the Lebanon.

My dear Lacy, Jedda, December 26, 1939. I SEND you herewi th a copy of an interesting letter dated the 16th December received from de Gaury. In telegraphing to me two days later about Ibn Sand's apprehensions concerning rumours of tension between Iraq and Iran de Gaury referred to this letter and said that Ibn Sand was pressing him for a reply to his recent declaration and his offer to co-operate with us, emphasising the need for early preparations against coming events. So I hope the letter will enable you to form a clearer idea of what Ibn Sand really had in mind in his recent long statement, on which Bullard commented in his despatch No. 160 of the 13th November, 1939.(') 2. Perhaps the truth of the matter is, as Yusuf Yasin says, Ibn Saud regards himself as always at war, and wants to do his bit in the present conflict, without quite deciding what that bit is or ought to be. At any rate there is a good deal of material for you and our new Minister to think over. 3. The state of the Saudi finances seems to be worse than we had thought, and, with a small pilgrimage inevitable, the immediate outlook is not rosy. It is a good thing that Bashir as Sadawi, a man of increasing importance, has been instructed to go into the question of cutting down expenditure. 4. As for the methods in which we might help the King, there is one which de Gaury does not mention : it is the formation of a National Bank. You will remember that the Minister of Finance raised this difficult question with me as recorded in my despatch No. 135 E. of the 22nd August, 1939. No doubt what he was really contemplating was getting British help in straightening out accounts which it is impossible to balance, so that the onus of failure could be cast on someone else. The functions and the powers of the bank would have to be very carefully thought out ; but it may be possible, with goodwill on the Saudi side, to devise some means of British assistance in getting order out of chaos in Government finance. One great difficulty would be the control of the expenditure of the court. 5. As for the provision of meteorological data, we have already endeavoured to get the permission of Ibn Saud for the importation of meteorological instru ments offered us by the Sudan Government, without much success. Yusuf Yasin seemed to think that instruments erected on our roofs would be liable to misinter pretation. However, de Gaury's proposal to train the Saudis to record their own meteorological data is on a different footing. The difficulty might be to ^ persuade the Saudis of the necessity of having such data at all : perhaps when some of their ancient aeroplanes crash in bad weather (which God forbid) they might see the need more clearly. Yours sincerely. ALAN C. TROTT. Enclosure. Mr. de Gaury to Mr. Trott. (No. 8. Secret.) My dear Trott, Riymdh, December 18, 1939. I HAVE had, as you will have supposed, many audiences of the King since I have been here. Some of them have been very long, and Sheikh Yusuf told me that His Majesty had spoken at greater length than usual. He himself said that he had not talked to anyone so much since his talks with Sir Percy Cox. (') Eastern (Arabia), December 4, 1939, Section 2. [805 p—1]2. In point of fact he has not so much given me new material as embroidered the theme given in his recent ' declaration, a copy of which Sii Reader Bullard enclosed with his secret despatch No. 100 of the 13th November to the Secretary of State. . . i • • 3. We have, in our talks, made many excursions -into history, the politics of neighbouring States and so on—and the King s similes have been vivid and apt—but always he has returned to this same theme, which has, nevertheless, remained imprecise. I have come to the conclusion that it is meant to be so. In all his prolonged talks he has never come to a precise conclusion except that once there was mention of ' practical aid to us in case of need. I was interested to note that Sheikh Yusuf has now added to his oft-repeated remark about our giving of 60 million to Turkey and not 60 piastres to Saudi Arabia, , We are ready to be helped.'' 4. His Majesty left me at Kharj alone with his Minister of Finance and the hope that we should spend several days together. He must have been disappointed that I showed little inclination to investigate the murky depths of the State's finance. 5. With regard to Arab federation I feel sure that if Ibn Saud felt it were practical he would not so constantly emphasise to me his dislike of the Iraqi Government. He would gloss over their mutual troubles; not fasten on to them. 6. I believe that it is his intention to plant in our minds something like the following idea :— ' Iraq is unreliable, the French are mismanaging things in Syria, Palestine is troublesome. The only strong man, Ibn Saud, the c friend of Britain,' who can put this right and bring the Arab States into line, so that they can make a stand against our enemies is powerless because he has no modern army and insufficient money. If we give him £1^ million a year and some modern equipment he would save the day for us when the time comes.' 7. I give one and a half million as a figure because that is the sum Yusuf Yasin suddenly mentioned one day as likely to be the State's deficit in the coming year. 8. Sheikh Yusuf also gave me another hint. A promos of quite another subject to this he said : 'You know the King is really always at war. He has campaigned so much, and had to deal with so many sudden changes in politics, due to war, that he is quick and impatient even in small things.' 9. It would obviously be irksome for such a man as Ibn Saud to continue evenly on the way of peace without any engagement in the ' great opportunity ' now presented. 10. Some remarks dropped in conversation by the intelligentsia of Riyadh, the North African and Syrian officials of the King's Diwan, lead me to believe that the Government s finances are in an unhappv condition, but that with boirowings trom the C.A.S.O.C. [California-Arabia Standard Oil Company], against tutuie royalties and with economies, with the making of which one of the officials, Bashir-as-Sadawi, has been specially charged, it should be able to keep going until the oil royalties begin to come into the Treasury in full ilood m about two years' time. 11. Subject to any new revelations in this field, I am not of the opinion that it is necessary to subsidise Ibn Saud, although I think that we should keep i m mind. If the prices ol food-stuffs rise much we may have to do so, or come o some helpful arrangement I am writing to you separately about this, a subject raised by Sheikh Yusuf Yasm. J &gt; j 12. With regard to the bigger issue which the King has raised, I do not su PP ( f e oJ 10 I f oir J ent ti:iat Hls Majesty's Government intend to go all the way with him. Should they go part of the way with him ?

The Government should be moving to keep pace with these changes and Ibn Sand knows it. He has recently brought to Riyadh a large number of soldiers and police in uniform. He flouted the priests and there was no resistance. It was a test case and important. Since then there have been many incidents of change which are startling to anyone who knew Riyadh even three years ago. There is talk of the first aeroplane coming to Riyadh, piloted by a Saudi pilot, Abdullah -al-Mandili, from the Hejaz. But with the relaxation of the stern Wahabi code to suit changing conditions, there must be some concomitants of the new order. There must be something like regular pay for State officials and soldiers, and a better organised army and police force. Even rigid economy will not provide a large enough margin for this. 15. This is not of great consequence to Great Britain, it seems to me, unless there is some possibility of our requiring facilities from Ibn Saud later. In that case we should do well to help him put his house in order now. It will be at least two years before he begins to become richer and richer from oil royalties. 16. With regard to the facilities, those which occur to me are— {a) The use of the lateral road along his northern frontier, from Koweit to Transjordan, and either Haifa or Akaba. Repair of this road could be carried out now if lie had the money and an engineer. The King, if provided with these, would not object, as it would be advantageous to him to have a good frontier road, as long as he felt our holding in the Koweit Bay was unimpaired. If part of it were ceded by Koweit to Iraq he would no doubt think differently. (b) The use of landing grounds in North and North-Eastern Arabia, the grounds being provided with petrol reserves. This would be advantageous to the King, and if he were provided with the money he might not object to making the necessary improvements and building petrol tanks during the coming year, for the use of his own air force. (c) The provision of meteorological data. His own air force will, or should, presumably require this, and I do not see that there could be any grave objections to a few Saudi Arabs being trained for this work in Egypt, so that in case of need the Saudi Arab Government could arrange to furnish the information to our air force, or, perhaps, to the Bahrein Government for transmission. 17. There are probably other facilities which we might like to have given to us. I have mentioned those which have occurred to me, and the preparation for which need not affect Saudi Arabian neutrality, since they are consonant with a normal programme of modernisation, which the King seems impatient to begin. 18. I believe that His Majesty is genuinely anxious to help if he can, but at the same time he hopes that there will be incidental advantage to him. If we do think that sooner or later we may require facilities, I suggest that the matter be considered and dealt with expeditiously. Everything takes a long time in this country. 19. If the possibility of our requiring Ibn Saud's ' practical aid ' is very remote, I think we should lead him to understand this. It will make a difference to his plans, and perhaps still the mind of that restless old campaigner, whom we courted in the last Great War. Yours. &amp;c.

My Lord, Jedda, February 6, 1940. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 21, 22 and 23 of the 5th February, I have the honour to report that, on receipt of your Lordship's instructions, I addressed to Ibn Saud two communications, of which copies are enclosed. 2. As immediately after the translation of these letters had been completed the King called for me, I handed them to him in person, explaining that I did not expect any reply until the following day, when he was also receiving me. 3. Ibn Saud, however, preferred to read the letters at once. He read the letter about Dr. Grobba first, and expressed gratification at its terms. He made no immediate reference to the question of guarantee. 4. The letter about arms and a credit was, I fear a bitter disappointment to him. He said, immediately after reading it: 'I cannot accept £100,000. My people and my enemies outside my borders will say that that is all I am worth in the eyes of my friends the British.'' Still, let His Majesty's Government rest assured that, even if he did not accept this sum or get the sum he wanted his friendship was unalterable and. however much they might try, no foreign Power could shake his friendship. I thanked him for this further mark of friendship and said that our friendship for him was also so great that, had he felt obliged to have a German Minister here, much as they would have deplored the necessity. His Majesty's Government would not have allowed their relations to have been affected by his action. Ibn Saud then touched on the question of the danger of his position if the war spread and the need for him to be strong and well prepared. £100,000 would be of no good to him. The point was not so much that he had immediate needs as that he must know and be able to tell his people that there existed funds on which he could draw if the need arose. He then got down to details, and said that what he would like was for a sum of at least £800,000 to be earmarked for his use during the war if and when he needed it. I replied that His Majesty had seen from my note that I had been authorised not only to offer a credit up to £100.000, but to state that His Majesty's Government would also consider sympathetioally suggestions for the further strengthening of the economic position of Saudi Arabia. His present request differed from his original request, and I could only submit it to His Majesty's Government. As I was to have the honour of a further interview on the morrow, we could talk again on this matter. As regards the danger of his position, I said that his best assurance lay in the fact that his interests and ours were identical; we had the same interest in seeing a strong, united and independent Saudi Arabia as he had. 5. He then touched briefly on his relations with Iraq and Koweit, and suggested that his Ministers, Sheikh Yusuf lasin and Sheikh Hafez Wahba, might, if I agreed, conveniently call on me and try to reach an understanding on the outstanding questions. I agreed and, as the time for prayer was approaching, withdrew. 6. Before leaving the palace I asked Sheikh Hafez Wahba to call on me in the afternoon and discuss the matter of credit, on which by then the King might have expressed further views in private. I wished to discuss before my next interview whether Ibn Saud had any intention of suggesting security for the much larger loan for which he was now asking. 7. Hafez Wahba duly called, and I asked him whether, in his opinion, the King would persist in his rejection of the offer of £100.000 credit for purchase of food-stuffs in India. Hafez Wahba said yes. Ibn Saud was very sad. The sum he had received would be compared with the very large sum loaned to Turkey, and he would lose face in the eyes of his own people and his enemies alike. I explained that no possible comparison could be drawn between the two transactions. The [3—86]2 loan to Turkey was a business transaction entered into because the exigencies of the moment and considerations of self-defence demanded it. e oan to Ibn Sand was the loan of one friend to another who was temporarily short of cash. No guarantee had been asked, and questions of repayment, &amp;c were treated as of secondary importance, to be settled later. I thought that the King oug to feel very pleased that within ten days of his asking for temporary assistance £100,000 was offered. Sheikh Hafez knew that finances were not conducted in the United Kingdom as they were here. Ihe Secretary of State could, not, as could the King when he wanted to offer a present or a loan, dip his hand 1I ^o a box andl produce the sovereigns. Revenue in England was contributed by the tax-pa\cr, who had an uncomfortable habit of wanting to know how his contiibution was spent. I hoped that Sheikh Hafez would be able to make the King lealise that ? the production, almost at a moment's notice, of so large a sum was in itself a remarkable proof of His Majesty's Government s reaciiness to help. Me and the King could interpret my note. It seemed to me that it meant that £100,000 was the immediate response, and that more might be hoped for later if there was any real need for it. I hoped the King would not refuse it. Sheikh Hafez said that the Kino* could see the scoffing references in the Arab press : ' Ibn Sand bought by the British for £100,000.' I replied that it was ridiculous, anyhow, to talk about 'buying,' as Ibn Saud was known to be on our side. lies, said Hafez Wahba, but the Germans were prepared to pay £400,000 to have him on their side, or so Khalid-al-Hud had told him. What the King wanted was a credit for £800.000 to be open for the duration of the war and to be used as and when required, repayment to be made after the war. It was not so much that he had immediate need of this sum, but he wanted to be able to tell his people that his friendship with Great Britain had resulted in his having something to fall back upon in time of need. Pilgrimage receipts this year were bad; next year they would be worse, and he did not want to have to be perpetually coming to us, like a Bedowi with his hand out,' asking for small sums. 8. I told Hafez that I feared that, if we got up high among the hundred thousands, the transaction might cease to be a transaction among friends, but would become a business transaction. Awkward questions of security for the loan, interest, repayment, &amp;c., would have to be settled in advance. What would be the King's reaction if asked for security ? Turkey, whom they were so fond of citing, had exports, raisins, tobacco, &amp;c. I raised this point, as Mr. de Gaury had told me that he thought the King expected a bargain. 9. I asked Hafez Wahba whether he thought the King could be induced to accept the £100,000 if it were placed to his credit freely to use as he liked. I felt that I was justified in the light of paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 10 in making this suggestion. An alternative suggestion made by Hafez W r ahba was that not only the £100,000 food credit but the £85,000 arms credit which, on my own showing, could not, at any rate for the moment, be used for the purchase of arms in Great Britain, should be freed, and that to the resulting free credit of £185,000 £15,000 should be added, making £200,000 in all. It would be understood that the assistance so afforded was for this year's needs, and that it would be open for him to submit for the sympathetic consideration of His Majesty's Government an application for help, if needed, next year. I asked why there'should be magic in £200,000 if £100,000 was so derisory a figure in the eyes of the outside world. Hafez Wahba explained that the magic would lie in Ibn Sand's ability to say to his people that he had been given all the help he needed this year, and felt confident that His Majesty's Government would help him, if necessary, next year. 10. Hafez Wahba said that the real reason for the King's statement to Sir R. Bullard that he wished to await the end of the war before purchasing arms was that in view of the publication of the amount of the loan to Turkey he did not want news to get abroad that he was being offered so meagre a credit compared with that given to Turkey. I repeated that it was unreasonable to compare Turkey with Saudi Arabia in this connexion. If we were spending millions in Turkey there was, as I hadl said, a factor of self-interest. Turkey was for the Allies an outpost, a bulwark against the spread of the area of hostilities. The money was being spent not to help a friend in immediate need but to secure our own defence. The loan could almost be classed as expenditure on coastal defence. One could not conceive that Saudi Arabia would ever be called upon to act as a bulwark against an invader. If it did, against all present hope and belief, come into the war zone then, as I had informed HisI lilllHItHMHHH Majesty that morning, our interests were identical with his own—it was of the hignest importance to the British Empire that his kingdom should remain strong and independent and its integrity be unimpaired. 11. What, said Hafez Wahba, about a possible threat from Italy? I repeated what I had been authorised to say : namely, that it was unthinkable that Italy would break her agreement with us and risk war for the sake of annexing a portion of territory which could be of little value to her. I added that I had recently spent two years among the Italians in Italian East Africa, and that my personal opinion was that Italy had her hands full and could not afford to launch forth on new adventures. If this war was a tragedy to the rest of the world it was a god-send to Italy, who could hope, if she remained neutral, to repair some of the serious gaps made in her financial structure by her adventures in Italian East Africa. Moreover, if Italy wished to keep her empire, it was vitally necessary for her to have unimpeded access to the Red Sea for the purpose of restocking herself not only in petrol and food-stuffs which could perhaps be stored but in man-power which needed, owing to the climate, to be constantly renewed. Hafez Wahba thought that this would interest the King and help to allay his apprehensions. I hoped, though I refrained from saynig so to Sheikh Hafez, that it might head the King off from the snag of his request for a specific guarantee against aggression. 12. As reported in my telegrams Nos. 21, 22 and 23 I saw the King again on the morning of the 4th February. 1 spoke first about the question of credit in the terms of my conversation with Sheikh Hafez Wahba, reported in para graphs 7, 8 and 9 above. The King talked for some time about the large sums we had spent on King Hussein during the war of 1914-18 and of the part that he, Ibn Saud, had played in the war. His share in the reward was not great, but he had been happy to receive it as a present from a friend. He was a very old friend, the Turks were new friends acquired for the needs of the moment. Ibn Sand's point is, I gathered from this conversation and from my talks with Mr. de Gaury, that in time of war the potential enemy gets the money and the friend whose loyalty and co-operation are assured gets an expression of gratitude. He said that if he were to remain strong in his own country, as His Majesty's Government wished him to be. he must be generous in his distribution of food and money to his tribes. As I knew, the revenues of his country were insignificant and even in a good pilgrimage year barely met necessary expenditure. However, as long as he felt that he could rely on His Majesty's Government to afford material assistance if he required it in future years he would like me to put forward my suggestion about an unrestricted credit for £200,000 to be repaid after the war. He would spend the money on the purchase of food-stuffs and some perhaps on arms which His Majesty's Government might perhaps sanction his buying in the neutral market if they themselves could not supply his requirements. I thanked him and said that whatever assistance it would be found possible to give he must not regard the sum as he had appeared to do yesterday as a measure of His Majesty's Government's appreciation of his friend ship. The value of his friendship could not be reckoned in terms of sovereigns. 13. He then wished me to talk to him about the guarantee of non-aggression for which he had asked. I replied that His Majesty's Government trusted that he would have confidence in them and would not press them for a specific guarantee. I used the arguments with which your Lordship was good enough to supply me and repeated much of what I had said to Hafez Wahba regarding Italy's position in the present struggle. The King appeared to be entirely satisfied! and Hafez Wahba, whom I saw after the interview, confirmed my impression that he would not press for a specific guarantee. 14. I feel that Ibn Saud, by his rejection of Grobba, by his acceptance of a general verbal assurance in lieu of a specific guarantee, and by his readiness to accept a much smaller credit than he felt the safety of his position required, has shown both loyalty and understanding and I sincerely trust that I may be authorised to inform him that His Majesty's Government have agreed to my proposal for a £200,000 credit and a promise of further help if and when required during the period of hostilities. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD.Enclosure 1. Mr, Stonehewer-Bird to King 'Abdul Aziz. Your Majesty, Jedda, February 2, 1940. HIS Excellency Sheikh Hafez Wahba on the 18th January conveyed to me at your Majesty's command an acknowledgment of my letter of the 17th January regarding Dr. Grobba and at the same time requested me to communicate to the Government in the United Kingdom your Majesty's views on this matter. On the 21st January Sheikh Hafez informed me that permission was not being granted to Dr. Grobba to return. I am authorised to inform your Majesty that the Government in the United Kingdom have learnt with interest of your attitude to Dr. Grobba's visit and applaud the resolution with which your Majesty has acted. They feel that having taken this stand it is necessary for your Majesty's dignity and from every point of view that you should abide by it. They are convinced that you need have no apprehensions about the consequences. It is almost unthinkable to suggest that Italy would break the Middle East Agreement and risk war with Great Britain for the sake of German representation in Saudi Arabia. The Govern ment in the United Kingdom have always tried to advise your Majesty in your own best interests. In this case the advice was based on the sincere belief that the misunderstandings to which the reception of a diplomat of Dr. Grobba's reputation would give rise and to the offensive which he might attempt would be as embarrassing and dangerous for your Majesty as for the Government in the United Kingdom. Had they had the slightest grounds to suppose that a refusal might have serious consequences they would certainly have warned your Majesty. If, nevertheless, your Majesty feels that Italian retaliation is possible they invite you to read again paragraph 6 of the letter which the Prime Minister addressed to your Majesty on the 23rd March and also paragraph 2 of Sir Reader Bullard 's letter of the 30th April. The Government feel that these two messages will show that they regard your Majesty's interests as their own. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIED. Enclosure 2.

And I arranged with the Bahrain people to make the arrival as unofficial as possible. 3, I enclose herewith for your information copies of telegrams from and to the Government of India about the visit. The Amir 3aud was most grateful for anything we could do for him and conveyed a personal message of thanks from Ton 3aud also. Most of my call on him was taken up with arrangements 5 but he was good enough to return it though I certainly did not expect him to do so as he was here for so short a time. On the return call I introduced the Senior Naval Officer who very kindly arranged lor one oi the sloops at the mouth of the Gulf to collect any message the Amir wanted to send to Ibn 3aud. A message arrived yesterday morning and I passed it on to the King. 4, The Amir 3aud was as charming as ever and even found time to visit the new Bahrain Government Hospital while he was here. He told me that while the King and he had to be Honourable Lieutenant Colonel rather G.G.Prior, C.I.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire.rather careful about what they said in public they were *j _ %j both very much on our slie. 1 thought it was rather unfair to try to draw him into any lengthy conversation on t is occasion but possibly I shall have an opportunity for a longer discussion when he comes back, 5. The younger brothers who are accompanying him are undoubtedly out to enjoy themselves. They started with a tremendous party in Bahrain, and were cast into some confu sion on Saturday morninp when &gt;haikh Hamad said he hoped they had slept well.

The Secretary of State recognises that the gravity of the statements which Mr, Philby is reported to have made since the outbreak of war lies in the embarrassment which tney naturally cause owing to their being made in a foreign country where he is well known. Lord Zetland is giving careful consideration to the question whether he would in consequence be justified in withholding in whole or in part Mr. Philby's pension., on the ground of grave misconduct, The matter is however not without difficulty., partly because of the absence of precedents known to th^t? Office for interfering for like reasons with an officer's pensionj and he would be glad to be informedj for his guidance ? whether any comparable case has occurred in which the activities abroad of the holder of a Foreign Office pension have been a source of embarrassment to Government, 3.

In the meantime, however ? he would be willing, if such a course commended itself to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that Mr. Stonehewer-Bird should be authorised to make an oral communication to Mr. Philby as from the Secretary of State for India, to the effect that his reported statements have come to notice, and to ask whether he has anything to say regarding them, since such statements, if in fact made as reported, might raise the question whether the pension should be reduced or withheld. It seems possible that such a communication might serve as a warning and a deterrent of further objectionable activities on Mr. Philby's part, I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sjsti.)

His earlier activities are explicable on the theory of his devotion to Ibn Saud, but his later utterances go to prove him a traitor to his country&gt; ana one whom apparently his Arab hosts can no longer stomach. XHe question of threatening the stoppage of his pension was mooted here as long ago as 1925 &gt; but not pursued as it was believed he had commuted most of it.

We would urge that if the amount of pension which Philby is still drawing is substantial and if there are no le ^al objections the earliest possible steps should be taken to threaten him with its stoppage and to implement the threat should he refuse ....refuse to mend his ways. We consider that he has been i iven enough rope already and that as imaediate action as possible should be taken to curb his activities. If it is not found possible to stop his pension, we hope that in any case His Majesty's Minister, Jedda will be authorised to call upon him for an explanation of his conduct and tell him quite plainly what we think of him, 3# With regard to Prior 's proposal that his passport should be cancelled, presumably nothing can be done unless he sets foot again somewhere in the British 'ire* As soon as he does this, we hope it may be possible to take steps by cancelling his passport preferably by still stronger action to prevent him from return in., to Arabia or any other place in the liast where his presence would be noxious* 4* We are sending a copy of this letter to . rior# Yours sincerely, Gd/- W.

This paragraph was based on a sentence in Bird's letter ^hout Phi lby which read w De Oaury had been w in structed to explain to Ibn Saud that the plane, which 'carried no armaments or bombs, had made a forced 'landing* Philby arrived at Riyadh a few days later M and gave it as his opinion that the plrme had been sent 'to bomb the village and that the natives* action in 'killing the occupants wss fully justified'. 3. We do not know whence Bird got the information on which he gave these instructions to de Gaury, but Blaxter has now written to me to say that the official explanation is not really correct, since the Colonial Office information is that the machine was on its way to inflict punishment on tribesmen for previous incidents, and had to turn back before reaching its target. 4. This correction seems rather to invalidate this particular charge against Philby. Yours sincerely, (Sgd •) • iSyres.

After the Amir had said how much he had enjoyed the journey and how grateful he was to the roverni.eiro of India for the assistance given to him while in India Shaikh Hamad asked for the latest war news. I told hem what I had heard on the last news bulletin from London and mentioned the bombing by French planes of factories producing war materials in the suburbs of Berlin. The Shaikh a speared much perturbed by the whole situation and the Amir Saud reluctant to expand on the subject. I'he Amir asked me whether I had heard that the British Ambassador in ;ome had left for 7 ondon and also that Turkish troops had been sent to Syria to relieve French troops required in France. I said that I had not, and the idea of Turkish troops in Syria seemed to worry the Shaikh who enquired anxiously whether I thought President Inenu was a man who could be trusted. I said that I thought that Turkish relations with the Allies were excellent and gave no cause for worry. The discussion then centered on the influence of the Pope in Italy and the attitude of Russia if Italy interfered in the Balkans. The Amir had heard of the Russian broadcast to the effect that Russia would intervene on the side of the Balkans if Italy attacked any one of them but said that as It was not an official announcment his view was /~- 2 - 1 J- was that no great attention should be oaid to it. The Shaikh then announced thauthe object of German prooag ndi was clearly to create disturbances in as many 'olaces rs possible which would require the presence of Allied troops for their suppression and which would result in the weakening of tne -f-ilitjed Forces in France* The Amir agreed with this* The Amir then stated that although the position in France was serious ne was ouite certain that in the end the Allies would win. He further stated that if Italy entered the y ar it was equally certain that America would come in on the ..ide oi' the Allies. j uch time was then spent in endeavouring to explain to Shaikh amad the position in relation to Germany of countries affected by the war. 3.

The Italian paper's reoort gave the impression that the Ikhwan movement was still of great political importance in this country. Mr. de Gaury, however, went through trie list of settlements and made certain comments which rnay interest Your Lordship's department, and I now have the honour to submit a short note on the present position of the Ikhwan movement in the light of Mr. de Gaury f s report and such other information as is available. I must however confess that accurate information from Arab sources on this subject is almost impossible to obtain. 2. It will be remembered that the religious settlements of the 'Ikhwan 51 (brethren) date from 1912. A general description of their character and objects is given in !, Pield Notes on Saudi Arabia', 1935, pages 32 and 33. The original idea was to establish agricultural settlements throughout the various tribal areas, peopled by the more fanatical elements of Wahhabi Arabs, in order not only to break up the existing nomad and tribal organisation for the benefit of the state, but to retain the services of the fanatics and divert by degrees army. Mr. and Kuweit, territorial of Arabia', forming them and national published in into Iraq them from raids into the nucleus or a Philby's book 'The Heart 1922, contains many references to Ikhwan settlements and to the hopes which were then cherished as to their national,non-tribal, usefulness. 3, Mr. de Gaury, however, now informs me that in the opinion of many Arabs with v/horn he talked recently at Riyadh the Ikhwan movement is dead. Appendix IV, page 130, of 'Field Notes' draws attention to the gradual lowering of the strict religious standards which had been the boast of the first settlers in 'Ikhwan' co:nmunities. It appears that this deterioration of religious zeal has gone on at an increasing rate. Such settlements as remain are no longer purely religious colonies: the increasing tide of^prosperity and security against tribal raids has resulted in a good deal o~ tribal settlement, and the Ikhwan colonies have become merged, into, and. swallowed, up by, tribal settlements which nave little or no connexion with strict Wahhabi tenets. ^ In some cases Mr. de Gaury knew from personal experience that settlements Mentioned in the lists no longer exist at all: lor example, ^ the colony called 'Ureira' in the Ajraan tribal territory, wuicn never had more than about four houses, is COin 2 . deserted. The tendency towards tribal settlement is v ^ . shown by such schemes as the agricultural aeye opmeno a . ^ ? about which a separate report has been submiotet . I have, etc. (Sgd.) P.H.W.

In my telegram No. 76 I had the honour to report that 1 had thought fit to make oral and semi official representations to the Qaimmaqam of Jedda, as representa tive of the 3audi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding alleged anti-Allied feeling and talk among the Hejazis of Mecca and to a less degree those of Jedda. 2. ihree of ray Moslem colleagues had confirmed the report originally brought to me 'by the Indian Vice-Consul that a section of the native population of Mecca seemed to oe unfavourable to the Allied cause. My Egyptian colleague attributed this to the presence of so many oyrians for the most part ill—disposed towards France, Awad el Bahrawi Bey saw a remedy in the employment of Egyptians, 'all of whom loved England' in place of Syrians but for so long as Sheikh Yusuf Yasin holds his present position of trust with Ibn Saud he agreed that oyrians could not be ousted. My Iraqi colleague thought that the feeling was one of 'schadenfreude'. Arabs thought they had a grievance over the treatment of their kinsmen in Palestine and Syria and liked to see the Allies take a knock or two. There was no love of the Germans and every thinking Arab must realize that if the Allies / were ^ignt Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G. , , &amp;g. &amp;c.

He had explained that the JavanGSG could not stand on their own feet and ? that being so, profGrrGd the rulG of their present masters whom they know and rGspected to domination by a totalitarian power. 3. I personally feel that the unfavourable attitude of certain elements in the Hejaz is due in some measure to the fact that they are personally affected. The war has inevitably caused and will cause even more next season a serious falling off in the pilgrimage, a traffic on which the Hejazi fattens. They may feel like Mr. Philhy that a war which adversely affects Arabia should have 'been avoided even at the price of breaking our pledges and giving Herr Hitler a free hand in Europe. 4. My Moslem colloagUGS aro unanimous in thoir firm belief that Ibn Saud is genuinGly wgII disposed towards the Allies and that the large majority of his counsellors share his sentiments. 5. As regards the press, the Qaimmaqam assured me that there had 'beon no change in Ibn Saud's policy: the pross was to 'be strictly neutral and was to publish only / news' &gt;0 news and no comment. When I asked him whether he had not ■ h;Lmself noticed that in certain recent issues there was a preponderance of news of German and Italian origin s he replied that he never read the foreign news in the local papers and he did not believe that any one else did, as every educated Arab had a wireless set and listened to the news * ' L asked h±m how lie thought British compared with German and Italian broadcasts in popularity. He replied that what people wanted at the moment was straight and accurate news; tiiey didn't like tendentious comment such as Bari gave them. Germany had lost much ground during the s Norwegian campaign when their news was patently false even uo an untrained Arab intelligence. British news was felt ^ uo be accurate ? it was more detailed and;, most important ? the Arabic was better, was better pronounced and reception was better from England than from either Berlin or Bari. 6. Although I had impressed on the Qaimmaqam that I was not making official representations at this stage but merely wanted him to look into the matters I had raised and give me in due course his opinion, he must thereupon have reported the whole conversation to the King for he called on me a week later bearing the message which I summarized in my telegram under reference and of which a full trans lation accompanies this despatch. 7- I requested the Qaimmaqam to thank His Majesty for his message the terms of which would I was convinced give His Majesty's Government as much pleasure and satis faction as they had given me. In bringing this question to the Qaimmaqam's notice I was not actuated by the slightest suspicion that Ibn Saud had changed his policy or his / sentiments.^ 'J. I sentiments, l3ut I felt that the continuance of anti-Allied talk and the giving of greater prominence in the press to German news however unimportant they might be from the purely local point of view might when reported and read in other countries give a false and undesirable impression of this Government's attitude towards the Allies. 8. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Cairo (1137/1348/7) and Bagdad (1138/1348/^), to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine (1139/1348/7) 9 to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1142/1348/7) ? to His Majesty's Consul-General at Beirut (1140/1348/7) and to .His Majesty's Consul at Damascus (1141/1348/7).

The question which would have to be decided in such a case is whether epecific conduct on the part of &amp; retired of ficer ajaaountea to grave misconduct justifying the exercise of this power. Mr. Secretary Asoery feels doubtful whether at present the case is sufficiently strong- to justify such action, particularly as it is now unders'tood from .kr.iyTes'e ,!i| ' -d.o. letter of 21 i&amp;ay that the first of the charges quoted in the &lt; .leu • memorandum enclosed vith your letter of 1 April, No.E. 1426/710/25, has since been to some extent invalidated; and he understands from the last paragraph ol your letter of 1 April that Lord Halifax also is not yet fully assured that the time h&amp;s arrived for taking such a step, moreover, until the case for withholding the pension is more securely established, it would seem premature to call on Mr. , hilby officially to furnish an explanation of his conduct, since to do so would make it difficult to withhold the pension if a plausible explanation were furnished. 2. Cn the other hand iar. Amery suggests that there might be euvantage in action on the lines suggested at the end of the India Office letter of 3 Jfey. Action on these lines might take the form of an informal intimation to &amp;r. fhilby to the effect that, if the reported statements were in fact made as reported and if he should continue to conduct himself on these lines, the secretary of State for India would have to consiaor tho question of the continuc.noe of his pension, having regard to the rules under which it is drawn. Mr.Aiaery suggests that it is possible that such a preliminary warning, might serve the purpose of inuucin^ Mr. hilby to reform his conduct, and it would also be in accord with the principle of the practice normally adopted in the case of a serving' oiiicer, in fairness to the officer himself, of giving him an informal warning and opportunity to amend before disciplinary action is taken. 3. hx .Amery woulo accordingly suggest that .Mr. btonehewer Bird, it he sees no strong objection, might be asjted to speak privately to Mr.Pha.lby on these lines, making it clear, however, that he does so vvith the authority of the Secretary of State for india.

From this it will De seen that, except in the case of felony, which is provided for by a separate &gt;.ct, there is nothing in the superannuation i .cts which provides for the suBpension of a pension, anc I should ^udge that the Treasury would decline to do so for fear of action being taken against them by Petition of Right. In any case, I should strongly advise against any threat of this kind being used in the case of ir Karry Armstrong, seeing that the total pension which he is drawing is £236.5.1.

I received tnis morning a message from Ibn Saud informing me that Phi 1oy was leaving country and asking me to facilitate his journey. Philby was King thought mentally deranged, he never ceased heaping curses and insults and scorn on British Government. He had told Ibn Saud that ne wished to travel to India and U.S.A. for purpose of conducting anti-British propaganda. Ion Saud has given orders to Saudi authorities to keep close watch on him pending his departure and to inform him that if he indulges in anti-British talk he will be imprisoned. He has already been given warning to this effect by Qaimaqam. 2, Before this warning was received Philby remark ed last night in my presence and in that of British subjecto and foreigners tnat news broadcasted from London was 'contemptible rubbish'. On my calling him severely to task he became so violently abusive that I had to tell him that he would not be received in future either by my self or in any British house. ^ ^3.

Sir, Mr. Eden to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird {Jeddd). Foreign Office, January 7, 1941. THE Saudi Arabian Minister paid me a first visit this afternoon, when he said that he had received the previous evening a telegram from King Ibn Saud asking him to convey a message of personal friendship to me. Ibn Saud also wished to congratulate His Majesty's Government most warmly upon the victory at Bardia. All the Moslems, who were now on pilgrimage, would be earnestly praying for a final British victory. They knew how the Italians had treated Arabs in Tripoli and they rejoiced at the Italian defeats. 2. The Minister continued that he had a further message for me from Ibn Saud to the effect that, if at any time the King could assist us in our campaigns in Abyssinia through his influence with Mohammedans in the Harar area, he would be very glad to do so. 3. The Minister then spoke of the actual operations in the Western Desert. He wondered whether we were making full use of the Arabs for the desert part of the warfare. He felt sure that they would be only too glad to help by raids into Cyrenaica. I thanked the Minister for his message and said that I knew that Arab forces were being organised by General Wavell, and I had every hope that they were playing their part in the victories which we both welcomed so cordially.

IN accordance with the instructions contained in Viscount Halifax's circular despatch of the 4th November, 1939, I have the honour to submit the following- brief review of the situation in Saudi Arabia in 1940: — 2. Until the entry of Italy in June the war seemed to the Saudis very remote. The chances of the combatants were weighed; a few felt that Germany must win, the majority thought that neither side could win, and a minority, consisting mainly of King Ibn Saud himself, were confident of a final Allied victory. There were few, if any, who wished to see Germany win the war, there were many who rejoiced to see France and England, who, in their opinion, were holding down the Arabs in Palestine and Syria, take some bad knocks. 3. When France collapsed, public opinion veered round very sharply in favour of Great Britain. The French are unpopular with the Arabs, who compare the British policy of educating the populations under their protection and eventually granting them their independence, as in the case of Egypt and Iraq, with the exactly opposite system adopted by the French, whereby territories protected by France become slowly but surely absorbed, as have been Algeria and Senegal. There was much disappointment that, when the French authorities in Syria declared for the Vichy Government, His Majesty's Government did not immediately take over Syria and declare its independence. King Ibn Saud, the Amir Faisal and a few of the more intelligent understood the difficulty and delicacy of His Majesty's Government's position as regards Syria. 4. Whilst some may have favoured the Germans in the belief that the de\ i! they did not know was better than the devil they knew, no Arab here has anything but hatred and bitter contempt for the Italians, and Mussolini s declaration oi war turned many in Britain's favour. One of the effects of Arab contempt for the Italians has been to minimise the difficulties with which ^ His Majesty s forces have had to contend in those theatres of war where Italian forces ha\e been operating. The overrunning of British Somaliland did nothing to increase Italian, and little to diminish British, prestige. It was realised that this nev territory was only of value to the Italians from a propaganda point or view— tor they had merely acquired a port which they could not use and a population wnicn they could not feed—without command of the sea. _ i i _ ^ 1 5. Britain's cause has also undoubtedly been much helped by Italy s choice of representative in Jedda. Signor Sillitti has on more than one occasion mistaken arrogance for forcefulness in his representations to the Amir Faisal who has, in consequence, a deep personal dislike for hirm a lan ver a propaganda (Ibn Saud has prohibited all written propaganda) has aiso been particularly futile—a mixture of easily detectable lies and idle boasting. A v are not only amused, they are offended that so low an opinion their intelligence. The bombing of the Dhahran oil-fields no less than the self- contradictoiy explanations of the incident, which Ibn Sand took to be meant as a warning to him to remain neutral, did not help the^ Ttahan canse. matter 6. The feelings and opinions of the population . of f r ^ la little as far as the Government is concerned. There is r '° word is understood elsewhere. King Ibn Saud is e ^ ws 0 f ^ chief dictates foreign policy, paying little or no hee counsellors, Yusuf Yasin and Khalid -al-Qarqam nrlmirahlp pnd 7 King lb. S.u&lt;r. that 1, [17—59]2 S ! his desire for, or of his confidence in, a British victory. He has made it clear in his conversations, in his letters and in his actions that he fnlly realises that his interests are identical with those of His Majesty's Government. ? r3 8. The first action which proved the King's genuine intention to loyally $ serve British interests was his refusal to allow Herr Grobba, ex-German Minister J to Iraq and duly accredited minister to Saudi Arabia, to take up residence in Jedda, in spite of strongly-worded representations by Signor Mussolini. Although Ibn Sand asked for a British guarantee in the event of Italian action against him, he eventually expressed himself as satisfied with a reaffirmation of the assurances already given him that His Majesty's Government regarded his interest as their own. On the withdrawal from Dunkirk and on the collapse of France, the King sent messages of sympathy and expressions of his confidence in final British victory. 9. It is perhaps more by his attitude towards problems nearer home that the King has been of greatest value to His Majesty's Government. He stands almost alone in his sympathetic understanding of the difficulties which face His Majesty's Government in the matter of Palestine. Whereas the Amir Faisal and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin hanker for further declarations of British intentions after the war and for the immediate grant of a greater share for Palestine Arabs in the Administration, the King realises and has advised Arab statesmen in surrounding countries that present efforts must be concentrated on winning the war, and that it is the duty of all Arabs to refrain from any action which might impede Britain's effort. He has refused to consider joint action with neighbouring countries, a section of whose statesmen have thought that advantage should be taken of Britain's present difficulties to further Arab aspirations. 10. Though an economic survey is outside the scope of this review it is difficult, in a country which lives from hand to mouth and where, consequently, any departure from the normal has an immediate effect, to dissociate economic from political considerations. The reduced size of the 1940 pilgrimage placed the financial situation of the country in a precarious state and necessitated an appeal to His Majesty's Government for assistance. The loan by His Majesty's Government of £200,000 was eventually raised to £400,000, with a promise of a further £400,000 in 1941. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company advanced 3| million dollars in 1940 and are being hard pressed by the Saudi Government to advance a further large sum in 1941. The 1941 pilgrimage was, thanks to the action of the Government of India and the naval authorities, larger than could reasonably have been expected, but it fell far below normal, and the revenue it produced was proportionately lower still owing to the total absence of the more profitable pilgrims—Javanese and Malays. In addition to loss of revenue, Ibn Saud had greatly increased expenditure on subsidies to his tribes, who he feared might grow restive if not convinced that the war had in no way lessened his strength and wealth. 11. The country was cut off, except in the Persian Gulf, from all sea communioations for some six weeks after Italy entered the war and from communication with Egypt for about twelve weeks. The Italians were telling the world that they were in command of the Red Sea, and Saudi authorities and merchants were badgering the legation daily. They were inclined to place the responsibility—not where it lay, on Italy—but on British authorities, who should, they felt, run all risks in order to assure the well-being of the Hejaz and the profits of the merchants. When regular services to and from India and Egvpt were established the Italian Legation explained the safe passage of British ships by stating that the Duce, in his love for the Moslems, was prepared to allow ships to proceed to Jedda unmolested. This statement was greeted with derisive laughter and an enquiry as to why no Italian ships had been seen in Jedda harbour. There has been no lack of food at any time, nor have prices increased as much as was expected, but Hejazis have been hard hit and in many cases reduced to beggary by the reduced pilgrimage. The Government has on several occasions distributed food. 12. Relations with neighbouring States were on the whole good. The old- time disagreement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia about members of the Nejd Shammar domiciled in Iraq was settled by Rashid Ali in King Ibn Sand's favour. The trade, hon-voisinfige and extradition agreements with Koweit were put into force early in the year on an exchange of letters between His Majesty's Political Agent at Koweit and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, though at the end of the year thereI were still points of difference as to the final text and the agreements had, consequently, not been signed. Frontier incidents reported to King Ibn Saud in exaggerated and distorted form caused a few somewhat violently-worded protests against Transjordan officials, and there was a marked tendency on the part of Saudi Arabia to lay claim to territory which by any interpretation of agreements and by the reading of any map was well within the Transjordan frontier. Distrust of the Amir Abdullah is so deep-rooted in Ibn Saud that he will, it is feared, invariably take a biased view of frontier incidents, but, as he has frequently asserted, he will not allow his feelings for the Amir Abdullah to lead him to take any action which might embarass His Majesty's Government. 13. I have sent copies of this review to the Government of India, to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, to his Excellency the Governor-General of the Sudan, to his Excellency the Commander-in-chief, East Indies Station, to his Excellency the Governor of Aden, to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre.

Stonehewer-Bird 6th March, 1941 (Jedda) 4,00 p, m, Your tele/ram No;43 (of the 22nd January; Ibn Saud's request for increase in his subsidy). that Ibn oaud's attitude has been very advantageous I agree — _ _ . _ - to us, but he is already receiving a substantial subsidy from^us. ,/hether or not it v *ilj. be necessary t»o consiaej- increasing txiis assistance, I tnink it would be a mistake to offer anything at present. The position, as I understand it, is that, whereas only a few years ago the total income of 3audi Araoia was about •f*6Q0yC'C'vi' - -gv'-! &lt;, tiie increased i*e v enueo s. rom Lxie Oxi x oyalties n^v 0, during recent years, led to rising extravagance, so that the esti mated expenditure for the current year now totals £2,000,000 gold, whatever sums we -ave Ibn Baud would therefore soon disappear, and we should be faced with further appeals, difficulties about provid If, hoi jwever, we now make difficult!-s about providing more money, there is at least some hope that necessary economies may be introduced, and that any concessions we may make later will be .the more appreciated and put to better uses. 1 I i- i 2. I think therefore that you should reply to Saudi Arabian Government that I greatly regret to learn from you that they should be experiencing financial difficulties owing to fall in pilgrimage and customs receipts as the result of the war. There are unfortu nately many other Governments which in these critical days are suffering similarly from acute financial difficulties, and are having to impose drastic restrictions and hardships on the peoples of their countries. I had hoped that Saudi Arabia might have been largely spared these troubles since she at least remains at peace and is not burdened with the necessity for incurring vast war expenaiture. Moreover, although Saudi Arabia was, only a few years ago, dependent to a great extent upon the pilgrimage and customs receipts, she now receives substantial sums annually from oil royalties^ His Lajesty's Government had taken these matters into consideration when last year they offered Saudi Arabia on advance of £300,000 of which half has already been paid, while a further £200 ,000 will be payable in nprii, and the remaining £200,000 payable in October; and they trusted that these sums, when supplemented by the oil royalties and the other revenues still at the Saudi Arabian Government's disposal, would prove sufficient to enable then to carry on the administration of the country on the reduced scale which is appropriate in these difficult times. The £200,000 payable in April, together with the large sums recently by the Galifornian Arabian Standard Oil Company, should in enable Government to carry on for some months, during which necessary steps can be taken to adjust level of expendi- advanced any case time any ture to that o. receipts. You may add, i ' you think it authorities, necessary ? having taken that if, in the autumn, the Saudi Arabian adequate steps to set their finances in order, wish to approach me again, I shal: of course be ready to consider any facts which they may desire to bring to my notice, but I should hope that position may by then by greatly eased as the result of the measures which they will have taken.• (ihM 17 7 ? 61/11 Q Telegram From To No&gt;T/608 Dated the 10 th Sep tern 'ber 1941.

'Iter 2. I see certain advantages in -withdrawal of Italians from Hejaz. They, v.ith their compatriots in Yemen, are only remaining link between the Near East and Azores. Though their influence is nil at present they might if Germany advanced further east prove useful as a channel of communication with controlO) centre for fifth coiumnists, who might spring up if German forces appeared to be approaching. 3. As against this I see a possible disadvantage. I^o secrets are kept here. It will be known that H.m.G. are helping Saudi Arabian Government financially. It has already been said by Inb Saud's detractors that reals minted in India were payment by His majesty's Government for his opposition to ha-shid Ali it will be said that Inb Saud has been bribed to expel Italians. It seei s to me that much of Ibn Saud's influence with Arab world and perhaps Loslem world in general depends upon the fact that he is generally regarded as an independent monarch whose actions are not dictated oy any Christian power. Ibn Saud's value to us residents (gr.unu.) undoubted influence with Arabs of almost all shades 01 opinion The Italians are, of course, generally hated in the Near East but German propaganda would not be slow in endeavouring to reduce Ibn Saud's prestige by presenting him as a puppet in British hands 4. So Gaury has formed opinion from his talks in Riyadh that Ibn Saud would be prepared to Join the Allies openly and that military values of such an alliance would outweigh considerations in paragraph J above.

Political Agency, Kuwait, 24t]i DecenlDer, 1941. u On your visit to Kuwait this month I mentioned that I would like to visit Eiyadh and Hofuf, I am anxious to examine the road from here to Hiyadh and I would like to make contact with the authorities in Biyadh. Cooperation 'between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia is becoming closer day 'by day to, in my opinion, the mutual 'benefit of both countries and I feel that the Political Agent in Kuwait should know and he known to the Saudi Arabian officials, I do not suggest that my visit to Eiyadh should 'be in any way 'official' it would 'be better if it were not but I should like to have an opportunity of meeting Ibn Saud, I suggest that the most practical way of obtaining Ibn Saudis permission to visit Hiyadh would be for me to make a suggestion to the Saudi Bepresentative here explain ing that my visit was a private one and that I was not in any way associated with an official mission but rather satisfying my perfectly legitimate curiosity in regard to a very famous man and a weiijknown city. I do not anticipate that any objection would be raised and if I were successful in favourably impressing the Ruler it is probable that freedom of movement might be accorded to His Majesty's Representative in Kuwait. I suggest that I should return to Kuwait via Hofuf and the coast road, possibly crossing to Bahrain for a day or two en route, I should prefer to attempt this journey towards the end of January or the beginning of February and I do not anticipate/ he Hon'ble Lieut-Col.
