P olitical D epartment. From, 1 To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. The Commissioner in Sind, Kurrachee. Political Superintendent's Office, Jacobabad, Vlth August 1870. Sir, Political Superintendent's letter No. 1126, dated 4th August 1870. Political Superintendent's letter No. 1127, dated 4th August 1870, paras : 6, 7, 8 and 10. Political Superintendent s letter ^ o. 1151, dated 13th August 1870. Political Superintendent's letter No. 1154, dated 15th August 1870. In continuation of the correspondence noted at margin, I have the honor to forward another Diary of Captain Harrison s&gt; dating from the 11th to the 17th ultimo con taining copies of further correspondence between the Khan of Khelat (' or Khan of Beloochis- tan' as he is again styled,) and certain Sirdars in Seistan, other than those mentioned in the previous Diary. 2. Even a person unacquainted with the ramifications and restless ener- rr'ies of Khelat policy, would think it strange, to say the least of it, that at this particular moment, the latent devotion and fealty of many generations, should spontaneously be expressed by these Seistan naturalized subjects, towards Khe lat. It is a matter of great satisfaction to me as Political Superintendent on on this Frontier that the movement has been discouraged by my letter- No. 1126, to Captain Harrison's address, because whether Captain Harrison sees the design of it all or not, no possible good can come of a mushroom cor respondence, which might, at the pleasure of Khelat, trouble our Persian and Affghan policy at any moment. I look upon the matter in a very serious light when I bear in mind what adepts these Khelat officials are at secietly thwarting ' what they may wish to oppose, and I feel sure that though no defioed plan may yet have developed itself, yet that the position generally was assumed to be held in hand as a useful card to be played or not as might hereafter suit the Khelat game. 3. It was not without very good reason that in 1854 the late General Jacob, c. b ., wrote to the Khan ' From the first day of my receiving charge' charge of the Frontier of Sind, I have exerted every effort in my power to ' to bring about the establishment of order and good government in your ' Hio-hness' neighbouring dominions. But I laboured to little or no purpose, &lt;c for I was always secretly thwarted by your Highness' officers.' 4. Khelat history from that day to this shows that precisely the same system of ' secret thwarting' is now rife, whenever it suits Khelat officials to have recourse to it; and I am convinced by the multitude of facts that have come to light in the present correspondence, that the old spirit is still at work ; and what makes it the more dangerous and difficult to counteract now, is, that Captain Harrison fails to see it, and will not regard British Frontier policy from any but an exclusively Khelat point of view. 5. In addition to others the Government Resolutions as per margin afford proof of what 1 now state, and it will No. be I'' 46 impossible to successfully carry out Department. the policy therein advocated, if the Political Bombay Government Kesolution jW en t at Khelat continue to go dead against No. 2244, dated 16th July 18/0. ^ &amp; &amp; it as he has hitherto done. 6. This Seistan move on the part of Khelat bears a striking contrast to the impotent efforts of that Government at Kedj, and other parts of the Perso Mekran border. There where such expressions of devotion, as those reported from Seistan, would be especially useful to us, if verified by acts, the Khan has failed to carry duo weight with the most powerful of the border Eelooch, and but for your own diplomatic efforts in that quarter, the Persians, who evidently hold KHelat in supreme contempt, would unquestionably have long ago passed their legitimate bounds, and done us an almost irreparable injury. 7. It would appear too from this example, that Khelat influence is strangely subject to the rules of contrariety—-just where, it would eminently serve British interests, as in Mekran ; it is weak, if not abortive, and on the other hand where the Khan's intervention is utterly useless, nay actually mischievous as in Seistan, he is made to appear in a light that throws the King of Persia and the Ameer of Caubul into the shade entirely. If it were not so serious, it would be ridiculous. 8. Under these circumstances I submit that the sooner the Khan of Khelat is advised to look to his home administration and policy, and to look for influence and popularity in that, the better. Let him, by adopting the principles of an enlightened rule, elicit expressions of affection and loyalty from his own instead of Seistan subjects, and then we shall have practical proofs ol improvements, that may be recorded with satisfaction for the information of Government. 9. I observe from the Diary that something has occurred at Lus Beyla, the particulars of which are not given ; but it must be an important cause thathas moved the Sbagassee Goolamjan, the newly appointed E-uler, and Misree Mull, to unite in urging the immediate removal of Naib Meer Mundoo. 10. I notice also that in the last para, of the Diary Captain Harrison reports the Murree raid on Poolajee, but does not attribute it in any way to Captain Sandeman's proceedings at Maree, as His Highness the Khan ventured to do. 11. I cannot help remarking, in conclusion, that the whole contour of Khelat proceedings at the present moment, indicates that she is getting out of hand, bearing in fact the fruit of undue and unqualified support. I have, &amp;c. R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, F. U. Sind. Diary hy Political Agent, Khelat, from 11th to 11 th July 1870. Monday. —Letter from Sirdar Moostuffa Khan and Surfaraz Khan, re sidents of Chaga Seistan, to His Highness the Khan of Beloochistan. After Salutation. —It should be known to you that we have always con sidered ourselves your subjects, and look to you for support and help. We heard of your kind feeling towards us through the Zuggur Mingul, Sirdar Abdool flehman Khan. Your Highness knows that we Sunjranees were for many years your faithful servants, now we are scattered about the country, and being surrounded by enemies, day by day our lands and possessions are wrested from us. By your Highness' prosperity we took Chaga from the Seistanees ; these low-bred people will not leave us alone, but if your Highness will aid us, we can easily defeat them. At the latter end of August, the Belooch and Seis tanees are coming to attack us ; our fate, whether for good or evil, is on your head, for, without support, we cannot defend ourselves against the Gujjurs. If you will either send your Shagassee or come yourself to our support, we shall be thankful, please reply to this letter. If you cannot arrange to assist actively, please allow us to settle in your country, and give us food and water, otherwise the Gujjurs will make us and our families their slaves. Please think over the matter ; if you would only assist, we could clear the whole country up to Seistain and place it under your rule. Though I have written briefly, you will see how anxious we are ; we both wish to make our salaum to you, but the Gujjurs necessitate one of us being always present and on ihe alert. We have therefore arranged that Moostuffa Khan should pay you a visit if possible.Ibralilm Khan and Surfuraz Khan are brothers, and Moostuffa Khan is their cousin. Ilis Highness replied to this letter, and to those quote'd in last week's Diary, to the following effect :—That as Belooch, he should always take a lively interest in their welfare, but as they had settled in Patan country, he could take no active part in their disputes. His Highness pointed out that unanimity and a defensive policy might ameliorate their present condition, but that a^erressive acts would add to their troubles. In conclusion. His Highness said Oo ' o that he should be very happy to hear from them, whenever they felt disposed to write. Tuesday. —Visited His Highness. His Highness received information from Seebee that Shahan Murree had O brought a letter for Sirdar Moola Mahomed's son, which had at once been forwarded to Kandahar. The same correspondent mentioned that a house was about to be built on the Shum Plain. Wednesday. —Nothing to record. Thursday. —Sirdar Faquir Mahomed, Naib of Kedj, arrived. Friday. —Wuzeer Khan Raizanee, a proscribed outlaw and murderer, was arrested by the Naib of Quettah, agreeably to instructions issued by His Highness in November last. On being searched, twenty or thirty letters from Sirdar Moolah Mahomed were found. His Highness informs me that amongst the number is a voluminous document for Captain Sandeman, the Deputy Commissioner of Dhera Gazee Khan, which shows such uncalled for inter ference in his affairs, that he proposes writing himself and claiming the protec tion of the English Government, forwarding original letters for information. Saturday. —His Highness informed Sirdars Ala Deena Tvoord and Inde ral! Adum Khan that letters were found on Wuzeer Khan, proving that they were still in correspondence with his rebel Chiefs ; that if they acted with such duplicity, he could never acknowledge them as Sirdars of their tribes. The Sirdars positively denied having had any correspondence of the kind. His Highness said that he had no wish to withdraw what he had granted, and that it was quite optional with them whether any enquiry should take place ; if innocent, it would be a very simple matter. These Sirdars were glad to avoid all investigation on this subject, and quite satified at being permitted to resume their lands. Sunday. —Sirdars Ala Deena Koord and Wudera Adum Khan visited His Htghness and left for Murow. His Highness also gave them a letter to His Naib at Dadur, ordering him not to interfere with them in any way.f Merchants lately arrived from Kandahar state that the water in the Helmund is very low, J less them usual. His Highness received two telegrams from Beyla; one from Misree Mull, the other from Shagazee Goolam Jan, 'both of whom request the immediate removal of Naih Meer Mundoo. The Murrees made a raid on Poolajee, in Cutchee, killing several people and carrying off cattle and sheep,-—with these exceptions, the week has passed in the usual quiet manner. C. H.
