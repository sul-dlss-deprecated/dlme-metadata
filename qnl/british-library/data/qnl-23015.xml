Sir, I have tne honour to state that a number of new sections have had to be opened in this oilice from time to time ih recent years, to cope witn increase oj work. This has necessitated considerable reshuffling and redistribution of -works amongst the various sections'., ' Doing partly to the changes referred to .above and partly to the inexperience of staff, bills, letters etc, received in this .office are not always -narked for. the proper sections concerned with the re sult that -their linal disposal is delayed. sometimes, documents are,, even mislaid in the course of their movements from sections' to sections. In order to avoid mis-marking'or at least to minimise it, it is considered desirable that the Departments etc. should be aware of the distribution of work amongst the various G.A.D. and IWM.D. Sections of this b lice and that tne names of the sections should be shown in bills letters .etc. sent-to this'office. Accordingly a list showing the G.A.D. and the T.a.D. sections oi this office, dealing respectively with Gazetted E.T.O.and non-Gazetted Government servants of the Various Departments etc. is enclosed. it is requested that instructions may kindly be issued to all concernedj to show, in future, the names of the G.A.D. and T.A.D.Sec tions as indicated in the list, in all bills, letters etc., as far as possible, to facilitate correct marking of such documents and thereby to ensure their speedy disposal. This opportunity is taken to point out that reminders in the form of cards, . letters, ordinary or express and telegrams do not always indicate the subject of the previous reference or where the subject is given, it is not. sufficiently informative to.enable'this office to determine the sections C J concerned. It is, therefore, requested that in furure, subjects may in variably be stated clearly in all reminders and if possible the name of the Section concerned* as indicated in the enclosed statement may be shown. The G.A.D. deal with the pay, T.A.,leave, leave salary, passage etc. of Gazetted Officers and the T.^.D.

Joining time for persons joining posts in remote localities is governed by FR. 105 (d) which reads as under:- 'F.R. 105- Joining time may be granted to a Government servant to enable hiips XXX (d) (i) to proceed from a specified station to join a post in a place in a remote locality which is not easy of access: (ii) to proceed on relinquishing charge of a post in a place in a remote locality which is not easy of access to a specified station. Mr. Joshi joined his post in Bushire and was therefore on joining time under F.R. 105 (d) read with Supplementary Rule^ 294-A and as such he is entitled to draw pay and allowances as though he were on duty in his post as laid down under F.R. 107 (c). The view of the Accountant General, Central Revenues, in considering him on joining time under F.R. 105 (a) is therefore incorrect and I request that the above provisions of the Rules may please be brought to his notice, with a request that he pass the preaudit bill sent herewith.
