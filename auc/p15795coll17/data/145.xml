She recalls growing up in Middle Egypt, and her university and graduate education at Cairo University.  She tells of her mentor Professor Akila Said, and following her to AUC in 1965.  Fleita describes AUCâ€™s Science Department over the years including its separation into the Chemistry Department and other departments. She mentions colleagues, Chairmen (like Adli Bishay), Deans and Provosts, and upper administrators, as well as notable students/graduates of the program. Developments in the chemistry program and curriculum are covered, as well as facilities like the downtown campus Science Building (and facilities pre-dating it), and in the School of Sciences and Engineering Building on the New Cairo campus. She also compares students at AUC when she arrived with later generations, discussing issues like academic dishonesty and how it was facilitated by mobile phones. </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
