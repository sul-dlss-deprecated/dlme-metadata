Tehran, December 19, 1908.* This Document is the Pr operty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] gj r India Office, December 2, 1908. IN reply to your letter of the 13th October, 1908, respecting the inquiries of Messrs. F. C. Strict and Co., Limited, as to mining Concessions in the Islands of Sirri, Moin-ut-Tujjar, that the island is covered by the Firman from the Persian Government under which he mines oxide on Hormuz. A separate communication on this point is being addressed to you in reply to your letter of the 24th November, 1908. °As regards Nabiyu Farur, over which Persian sovereignty cannot apparently be disputed, it seems not impossible that the Moin may claim that this island also is included in the terms of his Concession. If such a claim can be established, it would be impracticable to support an application by Messrs. Strick, and it seems desirable to ascertain the precise terms of the Moin’s Concession before encouraging the firm to approach the Persian authorities. . . i n With regard to Little Tamb, Lord Morley concurs m the view that the island may be regarded as belonging to the Sheikh of Shargah. But the Government of India suo-gest that, before Messrs. Strick are authorized to approach the Resident at Bushire with a view to obtaining a Concession from the Sheikh, an examination might be made of the Islands of Dalmah, Sir Abu Nuair, and Halul, to ascertain whether they contain deposits of oxide. ^ n ^ £ j a- There appears to be no doubt that Dalmah, as stated by the Government ot India, is under the Trucial Chief of Abu Dthabi, while Sir Abu Nuair, according to informa tion given on p. 1292 of the recently received geographical and statistical volume of the “ Persian Gulf Gazetteer,” belongs to the Sheikh of Shargah. The status of Halul on the other hand, presents some difficulty. The papers forwarded with the letterfrom this office, dated the 2nd October, 190G, show that the island* (which is uninhabited) has no definite owner, but that any assertion of rights beyond the present customary usage of the island by Arabs from Bahrein, the Tiucial Coast, and El Eati, might lead to claims being raised by the El Katr Sheikh to which the Turkish Govern ment might possibly lend their support^ . Lord Morley would suggest, for Sir E. Grey s consideration, that before Messrs. Strick formulate their demands for a Concession on Little Tamb, their attention should be drawn to the possibility of oxide deposits being found on the Islands of Dalmah and Sir Abu Nuair. But as regards Halul, he doubts whether it would be expedient at PLEASE refer to your telegram of the 20th ultimo regarding Concessions for mining oxide in the Persian Gulf, telegram from Resident, Bushire, states that flag has been flown on Greater Tamb Island, but not on Little lamb Island, b\ sheikh of * Persian Gulf Gazetteer,” Geographical and Statistical Volume, p. 617.

I am to inform you, however, that a copy of the Moin’s Firman has now been received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and this document, as you will perceive from the copy inclosed,'-' contains no reference whatever to Sirri.

A' Secret Department. c Previous PapersNo. 189, dated Bushire, the 23rd January (received 2nd February) 1909 (Confidential). From— Captain A. P. Trevoe, I.A., First Assistant Resident, in charge current duties, To—S. H. Butlek, Esq., C.S.I., C.T.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 3620-E. A., dated the 23rd December 1908, on the subject of the oxide at Sirri Island, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a memorandum on the subject, drawn up by the brother of the Residency Agent at Lingah who recently went to Sirri to get samples of oxide. 2. From this memorandum it would seem that not much oxide is likely | to be obtained on this island, and that, before taking any further steps in the matter, any intending concessionaire would do well to prospect the island thoroughly. 3. I privately communicated this information to the local Agent of Messrs. F. 0. Strick &amp; Oo., who has recently been interesting himself a good deal in the matter. Memorandum drawn up by Agha Ali, brother of the Residency Agent, Lingah. As directed, I proceeded to the Sirri Island on the 27th Shawal 1326 (22nd October 1908), and inspected the oxide mines there, the samples of which I have duly taken and made over to you in four bags, viz.) Nos, 1 to 4. I beg now to give a description of the said mines. Sample No. 1 has been dug from the surface of the mountain up to 3 feet depth. Sample No. 2 was excavated from 3 to 7 feet depth. When the excava tion is carried on to a depth of 10 feet, only white sand is found. The distance from the mountain on which this oxide is found to the sea-shore is 2,100 feet; and the sea is deep enough for lighters to ship the stuff and for vessels to anchor there. The mountain is situated on the north of the island. Sample No. 3 is dug from a place near the sea. The spot is washed up by sea water during flood tide. I he sample was excavated from a depth of 3 feet, but white sand is found when a depth of 7 feet is reached. Sample No. 4 is from a mountain near the sea which is washed up by waves in a high tide. This mountain is near the mine from which the sample No. 3 was obtained, and both these mines, vis.) Nos. 3 and 4, are opposite to those Nos. 1 and 2. The Sirri islanders believe that the samples from these two mines which are near the sea (viz.) Nos. 3 and 4) are of the same quality as that of mountain No. 1, and that good oxide will be found if the said mountain is worked. I have inspected and dug several (other) oxide mines on the island ; but I did not find any oxide which could be worth working. White sand had appeared in several places which had been dug to a depth of 1 or 2 feet. I was detained at the island from the 27th Shawal 1326 to the 17th Zilkadeh 1326 in consequence of a severe storm which did not at all permit the jolly boat to leave the island. S. G. F.

With reference to your letters of the 2nd ultimo on the subject of oxide concessions in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir E.Grey to trans mit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a telegram, as marked in the margin, which has been received from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran respecting the claim of the Moin-ut-Tujjar that the island of Sirri is inclu ded in his concessions. It appears to Sir E.Grey that the inability of the Moin to produce the original firmans upon which his claim is based is fairly satisfactory proof that the claim is not well-founded.

Sir E.Grey would be glad, before replying to Sir G. Barclay^ telegram, to be furnished with the obser vations of Lord Morley on the situation which has now arisen.

C 7668 .(42046) (COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT), 7, WHITEHALL GARDENS LONDON, S.W. 1st December, 1908. ; I a r n directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th November, stat- ing that a telegram, dated 23rd November, had been re ceived from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to the effect that the Mouin-Utt-Tijjah claims that under the Firman of 1S04 the island of Sirri is included in the concession granted to him by the Persian Government, adding that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive the observations of the Board of Trade on the situation L J which had arisen, more especially as to whether any further steps could be taken to expedite an agreement with regard to the export of Oxide from the island of Hormuz. In reply I am to say that in view of the attitude adopted by Mr. Strick at his recent interviews with the Department - notes of which have been sent to the Foreign ! ^6 Under Secretary of State Foreign Office. |rr Office - and also having regard to the result of the more recent Interview between Mr. Strick and Mr. ELlinger to which Mr. Ellinger refers in his letter of 20th November, a copy of which is enclosed, the Board are of opinion that it is not possible at the present time to induce Mr. Strick to enter into a contract with the Mouin, through Mr. Ellinger, for the purchase of Oxide in the island of Hormuz, unless the Mouin is prepared to meet some of the objections raised by Mr. Strick to the terms which have been offered to him. Mr. Strick appears to think that there is more Hormuz Oxide available for sale than can be marketed for some time, and that, accordingly, the Mouin is not in a position to drive a hard bargain, and may presently be obliged to modify his proposals. Mr. Strick has also expressed some doubts as to whether the quality of the Hormuz Oxide is as good now as it was. In the meantime, as the Foreign Office are aware, Mr. Strick is making in quiries as to the possibility of securing concessions for working oxide on other islands in the Gulf, doubt less with the object of entering into competition with Hormuz should he not be able to come to terms with the Mouin. The_ The Board consider that it would he very desirable if Mr. Strick made a contract for the purchase of Hormuz Oxide, because, among other reasons, it would result in the freight being secured for British vessels a matter of considerable importance in view of the com petition of the Hamburg Amerika Line in the Gulf. But, if this is not possible, the Board think that should oxide of a somewhat similar quality be found on other islands.in the Gulf, the next best course would be for Mr. Strick to obtain concessions there, and thus en sure that a monopoly of Persian Gulf Oxide does not fall into foreign hands. The Board recognise that in certain circumstances it may not be possible for Mr. Strick to secure a concession on the island of Sirri, but one advantage in his doing so would be that the oxide would always be carried in British vessels. With regard to the formation of a British Company for the purchase of oxide from Hormuz, the Board think that there would be advantages in such a course, be cause the trade would then be carried on in British in terests for a considerable period. They are, however, of opinion that Mr. ELlinger will riot be successful in getting up a Company in this country, unless the recent scheme•»&gt; scheme suggested hy the Mouin is considerahly modified, and, even if more reasonable terms were offered by the Mouin, the Board think that, if Mr. Strick were hostile to the promotion of a Company, his active opposition might make its flotation very difficult, if not impossi ble. In their opinion Mr. Strick is more likely to enter into a contract with the Mouin, than to take part in the promotion of a company. With regard to the telegram, dated 23rd November, which has been received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, assuming that the Firman of 1904 does in fact include the island of Sirri, then it would appear that the Mouin has a bad title, at any rate to that part of the concession, as the Persian Government had no power to grant it, the island being claimed by the Sheikh of Shargah, who is under British protection, and the British Government never having acquiesced in the Persian claim, but, on the contrary, having protested against the Per sian occupation of the island in 1888. The Board presume that the Persian Government is hardly likely to take up the position that they had the right to grant a conces sion of Sirri in 1904 to the Mouin. AccordinglyAccordingly the Mouin may have a cause of complaint against the Persian Government, hut not against His Majesty’s Government, and, having regard to the history of the case, if the Persian Government have definitely granted this concession to the Mouin, it would appear that His Majesty’s Government have a cause of complaint against the Persian Government. But it is difficult to understand how the Mouin could regard the proposed action of His Majesty's Government as regards Sirri as hostile, if he is fully aware of the attitude His Majesty's Government have always taken up with refer ence to the disputed territorial ownership. The case would, of course, he different if the Mouin was under the hona fide belief that the Island of Sirri is right fully included in his concession, and that, notv/ith- standing this. His Majesty's Government is ignoring his title, and treating the Persian Government as law fully entitled to grant a concession for working the oxide on Sirri, and perhaps pressing for a concession to he given hy that Government to a British subject for the express purpose of injuring the Mouin's interestson Hormuz. The Board assume,however, that the position of His Majesty's Government in this matter will be fully ex plained to the Mouin, and they suggest for Sir E. Grey's consideration that he might also be informed of the assistance which has frequently been given by His Majes ty’s Government to his Agent Mr. Ellinger in connection with his negotiations with Mr. Strick, and in his efforts to form a Company, and that this assistance will be con tinued. I am to add that, naving regard to all the circum stances of the case the Board see no reason why the general line of action proposed with reference to Sirri should be modified, unless it transpires that the Per sian Government claim a title to the island, and have granted a concession to the Mouin on that basis. The Board are, however, of opinion that it would be desir able that any applicant who seeks the approval of His Majesty's Government for a concession for v/orking oxide on the island of Slrrl should be bound to work it under certain conditions to be agreed to by His Majesty's Government, and that it should be understood thatwm ; » a i J €D n lr i|. V that it such conditions are not complied with during the continuance of the concession. His Majesty’s Govern ment would demand its revocation, and also raise the question as to the territorial status of the island. I am. Sac . , (Signed) Arthur Wilson Fox. FI M W;A P © 28, OXFORD STREET, MANCHESTER. 20th November, 1908. Dear Mr. Wilson Fox:- I regret to hear that you are confined to the house for some time, and trust the rest may completely restore you. I saw Mr. Strick last week in reference to the contract for the Oxide, but I am sorry to say that I could make no progress. Mr. Strick refused to contract on the terms which he accepted in August last, and on being asked to state on what terms he would contract he gave me to understand that in his opinion his best policy is to sit still and wait until the Mouin is in such a posi tion that Mr. Strick can dictate to him his own terms. He also informed me that one of the conditions of any future contract must give him the right to terminate the contract at any time and should the quality of the Oxide deteriorate. I am of the opinion that the Mouin will • Wilson Fox, Esq., Board of Trade.will not accept any contract containing this condition, nor do I sec- any reason to suppose that any necessity wiil arise lor him to allow Mr. Stride to dictate to him his own terms for a new Oxide contract. Probably wnen Mr. Stride realises this in course of time he will i becorae raore reasonable and in the meantime we have again written to the Mouin, strongly urging upon him tne advisability of making reasonable terms on which a Company could be formed, or failing this, of concluding a contract of some years’ duration. In accordance with a suggestion made by Sir Richmond Ritchie in our last interview, we have pointed out to the Mouin that although he can rely upon the absolute protection of his property j.r. the event of a Company being formed, and upon the benevolent protection of the British Government during the currency of a bona fide contract, he cannot count upon our being able to Induce His Majesty’s Government to protect him should the necessity arise if we base „ our application upon a contract made after the urgency has arisen and having the appearance of being made for the purpose of securing this protection. We are afraid that there is nothing more to be done at the moment and regretrife B' 3 5CV \4 n regret that your kind offices and your trouble have not had a more satisfactory result.

In accordance with your suggestion I have sent the letter to Strick in an informal way, and I inclose a copy of the precise terms. Strick and Ellinger are corrupting my morals very considerably. WHEN you were last here you spoke to me about a letter which you had written to the Foreign Office, dated 7th October last, relating to iron oxide in the Persian Gulf. I have ascertained that the Concession to extract red oxide from the Island of Sirn may have to be given to a Persian subject, and it is understood that a Company entitled Messrs. Hadji Ali Akbar and Son (Limited), of 111, Portland Street, Manchester, are contemplating, if they have not yet actually made, an application to the Persian Government for a Concession in Sirri. . . . , . In these circumstances, you may possibly think it desirable to make an application yourself to the Persian Government or to communicate with the Persian firm in question, with a view to coming to some arrangement with them. As regards Tanb, Nabiyu Farur, &amp;c., about which you ask, the information we have shows, as far as it goes, that Tanb belongs to Shargah, the latter and the islands adjacent to Persia. The Government of India have been consulted on the subject by telegraph, and I will let you know the result when their answer is received. There will not, I anticipate, be any difficulty about your submitting an application for Concessions on islands belonging to Shargah through the Resident at Bushire.

We enclose extract from the Captain's letter, from which you will notice that the Inhabitants of Sirri consider themselves, and the Island of Jezirat Mabiyv.

Paton of the steamship 'Tabaristan' re Little Tanb, and Cirri Islands. As per your instructions, I called at the Is land of Nabiyu Tanb on the 21st, arriving at the anchorage 3.0, p.m. I at once went ashore, taking some of the crew with me, and took some samples of the Oxide from several spots. As far as I can judge they do not seem to be of bad quality, but appear to be mostly on the surface. On digging down, we cameto loose stones, which seem to be mixed with it. The getting of these ’7 samples took about 2| hours, and just as it was getting dark, we noticed that there was another hill of it, away at the other end of the island, but the heat was sc intense, and the walking so bad, that we were almost quite overcome, and had to return to the ship. There are no inhabitants on the island, and no wells of fresh v/ater. I do not know if it is possible to dig any, but, during the cool weather, the island is pretty well covered with vegetation, so I should think it possible to doThe next morning I left at 2.45 for the Island of Sirri, arriving at the anchorage there 5.50 a.m. I intended to go on shore myself, hut was still feeling the effects of the dreadful heat at Nabiyu Tano, so I sent the Chief Officer, with the Serang, one fireman, and a Persian Steward (to interpret). After being away some tv/c hours, they returned, and had found it so fear fully hot, that the Chief Officer fairly collapsed on the deck, and the others were nearly as had. However, they brought four samples from one place where there | was a good lot of the Oxide showing. The Chief Officer tells me that on digging down to more than a depth of 2 feet they still found the Oxide the same, sc that I should think it v/ould he a likely spot. I have rubbed out some of the samplos and as far as I can juoge, the colour and strength is fairly good, but of course I am not an expert. We were anchored off the Southern village of Sirri, in about 7 fathoms of water, the holding ground moderate ly good. There is plenty of water on this Island, and quite a number of inhabitants. When we were there nearly allall the men were away pearl fishing, and only the women and one or two of the old men left. They said the island was under the Government of Lingah (Per sian) as is also Nablyu Tarib. I do not think that Oxide nas ever been loaded there. These men also said that there was plenty of it at the 1'Torthern end of the Island, but the sailing directions state that there is very bad anchorage there. When leaving the island, I steamed round there, and found that there were a good many reefs sticking out of the water, to a distance of about half a mile from the shore. However, there may be an anchorage between them. After leaving Pirri, I passed within a few miles of Nabiyu. Farur, and by the look of the land there, I should say there is Oxide also; This is under the Governor of Lingah, the same as Farur, and most of the other islands in the neighbourhood.

IN the course ot conversation some weeks ago on the subject of the acquisition of a Concession for mining red oxide in the Island of Sirri, Eftekhar-et-Tujjar, Tehran representative of the firm of Haji Ali Akber and Company, stated that the Persian Government derived an annual revenue of 100 tomans from that island. As the matter seemed to me to be of some importance as bearing upon the Persian claim to sovereignty over Sirri Island, I requested the Acting Consul-General at Bushire to endeavour to verify the truth of the statement. &gt; Captain Trevor has now furnished me with the following information on the subject:— More than 150 years ago the Jowasmi Sheikhs appear to have crossed over to the mainland and to have taken possession of Lingah,'and down to 1887 members of their ruling families were Sheikhs of Lingah. They gradually came under the domination of Persia, though at first practically independent, and having become Governors, or Deputy Governors, of Lingah, subordinate to the Province of Pars, paid as much revenue to the Governor of Ears as he could extort from them. During this time, however, they continued to collect revenue from Sirri Island, and continued to rule it in their capacity as Jowasmi Sheiks. An expedition which occasioned a protest on the part of His Majesty’s Government was sent to annex Sirri Island to Persia in 1887, subsequent to the deposition by the Persian authorities of the Sheikh from the governorship of Lingah. Since that date the Deputy Governor of Lingah, now a Persian official, has collected the revenue, at first in kind, at the rate previously exacted by the Jowasmi Sheikhs, i.e., half a bag of rice for a small pearl fishing-boat, and one bag for a large boat; latterly this has been converted to a cash payment of about 100 tomans (20/.) a-year.
