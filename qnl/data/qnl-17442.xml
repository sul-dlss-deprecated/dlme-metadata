However, it is suspected that the former Governor of Bushire, Shaik Abdel Rusoll Khan [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān], is likely to return.Enclosed with the letter is a Royal firmaun [firman] from Hossain Ali Meerza, Prince at Sheraz, received at Bushire 10 March 1813. It conveys the regard and respect that the Resident is held in by the Prince; the Resident believes the firmaun to be designed to allay any alarm caused by the sudden seizure of the Governor of Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x000172#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
