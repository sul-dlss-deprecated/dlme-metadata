H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHREIN. MEMORANDUM:- In February last a boom arrived at this port laden with firev/ood, in charge of one Ahmed bin Saleh, a Persian holi. After the cargo had been discharged, a violent gale sprang up, and, the craft being moored at Mazruya, dragged her anchor and was pitched upon the Fesht al Zarv/an near the Customs Pier. It became a total wreck, but the Nukhudha and crew saved themselves. Ahmed bin Saleh duly communicated with his master, the owner of the craft, who lives at the Batna district, and-he was ordered by telegraph to remove everything possible or valuable from the craft, and abandon what could not be moved. The vessel is immoveable because the keel has been ripped away by its concussion upon the reef. I considered that the wreck ought to be removed or broken up; so in April, I boarded it, and formally declared salvage on it, and to give effect to my claim I removed a small mast. Since then I have tried to arrange for the wreck to be lifted off the reef and brought ashore, but so far without success. The best course seems to be to break her up before the winter storms begin. About a month ago one Aly bin Sukhuna, a Zubeyri, trading locally as a tobacconist, a person of not very good repute, came to me and said that he had bought the wreck, and would remove it. I told him that he was not permitted to do this. On 14th November, I observed Abdulla bin Hajy Ahmed and Yusuf bin Hassan at the wreck breaking up the deck, and I stopped their efforts. Thereupon Aly bin Sukhuna came and told me that he had bought the wreck from Mir Kutub al Din, a wood dallal of Kaharaq. for five hundred rupees. He produced a letter purporting to be written by one Khamis bin Juma bin Sahu, stating that this person had sold the wreck for Rs 136/-, but the letter neither indicates the complete date, nor the purchaser. I enclose it here with. I should be obliged if you would very kindly inform me if my action in declaring salvage upon this wreck was in order; and/if so, as this fact was commonly known, whether this Aly bin Sukhuna by his agents has committed a trespass on commencing to u&gt;/.crypNo. / Sres of 19 og # The Political Agency , Bahrain. Dated the 31st December 1929 To The Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer, Bahrain Memorandum. Please refer to your letter No. PA/G/78/304 dated the 17th November 1929. , rom your letter it does not appear that any notice was served on the o\mer of the wreck or his agent before salvage was declared upon it. In the aosence of any notification to the owner giving him a tiiie limit to remove the wreck, or of any communication to the Port Officer by the owner of his intention to abandon it, your action in declaring salvage appears to have been irregular and the tire ownership of the vessel, in the absence of any local rule to the contrary, would still vest in the original owner, he would tnerefore be entitled to dispose of it by whatever method was most convenient to him.THE CUSTOMHOUSE, BAHRAIN: 0 Ho 2nd Januar &gt;'- 1930 • H.B.H's Political Agent, BAHRAIN: ivSKORANBUM : - I than!: you for your No. 1805 of 1929, which relates to the wrecked boom lying on the Fesht al Zarwan.

We still believe that the craft is yet afloat and is plying in Arabian waters and that the tindal and crew have made a good thing out of it % We will thank you to send the correspondence to us through the right channel viz., the Shipping Laster Commander Page and then we will deal with the question in its proper legal aspect. Thanking you for your call and requesting you to cause private inquiries from proper authorities about this alleged loss. Y our* s faith f u 11 yKeauiari Karachi, 23ra February 1$31. To The insFector of Police ( Harbour) ( Keauiari). Dear Sir, With reference to the allegea loss of Our Sailing Craft 'Sorab” the crew has arrived today and on questioning the TincLel M Treecum Poonja, we were informed that he met with a storm 24 hours after he left Busrah and the Craft's bottom burst and it san±: and they were for four aays in a boat and they had no oars and no sail ( these were all sullied to them before leaving Karachi) and they drifted about for four days and the boat drifted away tfc some Persian village where they were picked uy from boat in senseless conditi on and were attended to by Persian men and women and from there they went to another village and the Sheik of this village sent -hem in a small craft to Bahren. I have just learnt that these fellows have a cart load of luggage vith them. It sfrou-d' very strange that in a little boat they could not only stow 16of their number but also a cart loan of luggage and that too in the midst of storm l nd also that they could lixxcL time to land all these in the fcreerrTT and .hat is more according to his tale they were all senseless tthen they were picred up. well on these coasts if they were found in senseless condition they would have been robbed of all their belongings and if not robbed it sounckJ still more strange that they could carry about their luggage from the village to village. we fear some foul play and we fill feel obliged b^ your kindly inquiring into this before these people leave for i^athiav.ar Coast by 'ChaKla' or by Country crafts. x t seems avery serious matter.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No:19453-A dated the 1st April 1931 regarding the recovery of repat riation charges of the ship-wrecked crew of the country craft 'Surah” and to enquire whether the amount advanced to the crew has been recovered from the owner of the vessel. 2. I notice from the application of the owner,which was attached,that he considers that there has been foul play and that the crew returned bringing a cart load of luggage with them. Whatever the truth the truth regarding the foul play,it is quite certain that when the rescued men were brought to Bahrain they had no such quantity of luggage,in fact they were patently destitute and I was obliged to supply them with clothing and blankets from our Hospital for which, incidentally,no charge has been made. 3. Since the owner made this allegation on the 23rd February 1931 I have no doubt that the matter has been cleared up by now and I would be glad to receive the money advanced by this Agency as soon as may be convenient.

TO The Political Assistant to the Cviumissioner in Cind. Sir, In returnrnt the file forwarded for opinion un officially toy you on 4th June 1931 and the compilation sutosetiuently forwarded on 16th June 1931, I have the honour to state as follows:- The Political Aeont Bahrein unuoutotedly acted unuer the provisions of suto clause (2) of section 75 of the Indian Merchant Shipping AOt whxch Becomes applicatole to Bahrein toy reason of section 5 (3) of the Indian i ercbant Snipping Act read with section 264 of the Merchant Chipping Act 57 and 58 Victoria Chapter 60 (1894). (jader section 78 of the I n uj.an Merchant Shipping Act toe British maia Steau Navigation Company is entitled to toe paid toy the secretary of state in respect of sutosistance and passage of the distressed seamen such sum per diem as the Governor General in Council may fix. The rules framed toy the Governor General in 16 Council do not cover cost of passage for distressed seamen• Unuer section 79 and 80 of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act when any expenses are incurred on account of distressed seamen for sutosi stance, necessary clothing, conveyance home etc such expenses arerecoverable frou* the Master of the f5hii&gt; or the ou,ner thereof in the manner indicated in section 80 and the following sections. This to my mind is the lav applicable to the facts of the case. The following expenses appear to have ueen legitimately incurred on the 17 distressed seamen who escaped from the wreck of the 'Surah' a Country Craft, ouner Pestonji Bhicaji:- Subsistence allowance in nahrein. Bb 25- fa-0 Passages per S•3. 'Bauxura ' charged by the British India Steam Kaviga- tion Company. Bs 325- 0-0 Subsistance allowance from Bahrein to Karachi at regulation rate of 1-2-0 per man per day. Ba 114-12-u total. Bs 465- 4-0 This amount therefore is recoverable from the owners of the Country Craft 'Sorab'. It is tx’ue the political Agent could have despatched these ship-wrecxea seamen under a conveyance oruer free of cost to Karachi leaving it to the British indiayi Steam Navigation Company to recover their charges from the secre^iy of State but inis is not a ground on which Messrs; Pestonji Bhicaji could fairly contest the claim against them. It is also true that the rules framed by the Governor General in Council do not provide for the payment of passage money, but the rules cannot override the clear provision in this respect contain ed in section 78 (i) of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act. The result is that in my opinion Messrs Pestonji Bhicaji are responsible and may be sueu for thepayment of Bs 463-4-0 under section 80 of the Act No remedy seems to he available in respect of the balance of Bs 72-4-0.

Uhen about twenty miles from Bahrain near a reef called Char Chus, I struck a rock causing a leak in my boat through which water flowed rapidly inside, so that the craft betaine water-logged, and grounded on the reef. I therefore dropped my anchor, and waited for help. After three days I observed a small fishing boat, which came to my assistance and landed me at Manama. Immediately after landing, I reported the accident to the Port Officer who immediately rendered me very valuable assistance by sending motor-launches to my boat, which lightered all the cargo, and afterwards towed my boat ashore to Manamah. 1 then discharged my cargo on the Pier at Manamah with the kind assistance of the Port Officer, for which timely assistance of his, I am very grateful to him.

As instructed, I explained to the nakhuona that he should not expect any liability by the Company before he preiers a claim and proves his case as the accident was apparently caused by his dhow showing no lights. He insisted as all the other crew did - that he showd light ana in addition to that, beat a mortar in order to call the ship f s attention to his dhow but all these proved futile as the Fast Mail dashed through his dhow ana drowned it and then saved the crew one by one and brought them to Bahrain tne same night. They claimed that they had a sum of Rs.500/- in cash on board being the sale proceeds of their catch of pearls whicn they had recently sold. They emphasised on , knowing what the Company was going to give them as compensation.

Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co.,Ltd., Agents, B.1.3.K.Co.,Ltd., BAHREIN. Dear Sirs, herewith a fuller report about the sinking of the Dhow outside your port. I have to report sinking a small fishing Dhow on the night of the 29th August off Bahrein Latitude 26.24 , N. Longitude oO.bO’L. All lives on board the Dhow were rescued. filter clearing the outer Buoy in Bahrein on my voyage to Karachi, I set my course and wrote ni fe ht orders. Fart of my night orders related to keeping a sharp lookout for native Cralt. About twenty minutes after leaving the bridge, I was walking up and down on my deck when the Third Officer, Mr. Ground, who was on watch at the time, sholed down to me 'there is a dhow very close sir' I immediately went on the Bridge and stopped the Engines - a sail of a Dhow was under the port bow'. Mr. Ground had already put the helm hard a starboard. The Dhow then scraped down on uhe port side and I ordered the helm hard a port in order to get the Dhow clear of the stern. After the dhow had cleared the stern, I turned the vessel short round and lowered a life boat which out away in charge of Mr. Machon, Chief Officer. Mr. Machon reached the Dhow which was in a sink ing condition. lie took eighteen men off her. The Crew of the Dhow could not speak English so I got an interpreter amongst my passengers', who informed me that all that were on the Dhow were present and that they had no cargo on board, but alleged tnat Rs .500/- in cash was lost in the Dhow. They belong to an Island 'Guttar” close to Bahrein and had been fishing. As I was about a 20 miles from Bahrein I decided to return and land the men which I did and left Bahrein again on Monday morning after reporting- the accident and handing over the crew of the Dhow to your goodselves. As the bow 6£ the Dhow when I left her was 4 feet aoove water I sent out wireless signal to all stations re-0 / 0 ^ reporting the position of the Dhow and also that she may be danger to navigation. that all he saw was a light practically under the 'fow and that he put the helm hard a starboard to clear and that the time was under 30 seconds from seeing the light to striking the Dhow.

One of (British)X n dia steamers met this dhow and, in spite of the fact that the people of the dhow showed signs by means of torches etcetera to draw the attention of the people of the steamer to their existence there in addition to the light which was on the dhow as stated by its owners, the steamer came into collision with it and caused it to be drowned in one moment. When the Captain of the ship came to know of this, he stopped the ship and performed the dity of picking the crew of the dhow and saving them from drowning. He then brought them to Bahrain where they were placed on board one of the boats of the Company at sea and detained there in a lamentable state of nakedness and hunger. These wretched people endeavoured and requested to come to the Agency so as to show their condition and to report their matter but the Pier officials prevented them fbom doing so.

The Pier officials aid not take any notice ana paid no attention to the letter which he showed them as if the correspondence exchanged between me ana the Representative of 8 G-reat Government were of no value in the eyes of those who prevented the Nakhuaha ana expelled him by force. 1 am really astonished to hear this ana at a loss to understand why this should have happened. I do not know how to compare the official correspondence which took place on this subject with the action taken by those who prevented the man without thinking of the consequences. This is a very strange matter which tends to show contempt and disrespect and injures the feelings and hurts the sentiments. This incident had such a great effect on me that I sent you a wire on^* 14th November 1937 explaining what had happened ana requested you to sena me a reply which I have not yet received.

Ah Issueu^ietter i&lt;o.412/v.0.a&amp;teu 18/li/3Z to the Ruler' 1 ^ 37P.U.C.36. The petitioners are Iranian subjects, they say they were bringing cattle and some sheep to Bahrain for sale. They met a storm, their boat capsized and was a total wreck. The cattle and sheep were drowned. They escaped in the dinghy. They have now been sent here by the Port Officer as distressed sea-men. Iheir boat they say is beyond salvage. They / only want to return to their home a village near Lingah.^ They say the^re are some boats here bound for their village or to some place nearby but that they will not be allowed to go by those boats unless they paid their passage. Their case falls under section 75(1)(c). I think the matter should be referred to the Bahrain Government who will no doubt arrange for their repatriation. They will be a burden on the Bahrain Government if they are allowed to remain here in this condition as destitutes and presumably they would prefer to repatriate them. The alternative would presumably be that we pay their passage, take down their statement and an undertaking that they would refund the amount in Iran, send this statement and the undertaking to Bushire for transmission to H.M.Minister Tehran for the recovery of the amount. In this case the recovery seems doubtful, as the Iranian Government may find an excuse that the distressed sea-men were in their own country i.e. in Iran and that there was no need to repatriate them. It would be presumably the Port Officer who will inform the shipping agencies about the ship-wreck. May be submitted to P.A. for orders? The petitioners are here in case yo i wish to see them. % /“'s 's/ Statement of Ramji Narsi, Nakhuda, sailing craft w tn Fateh Karim, belonging to Haji Hassan Abdul Ghani. I am unable to trace any definite ruling as to whether the Indian Merchant Shipping Act 1923, is applicable to Bahrain or not. K.R.2 of 1925, as far as I can understand, is meant to afford relief to pilgrims only, and even then I cannot trace any record of P.R. having delegated this authority to Bahrain. 2 . I suggest that we may treat them as ''destitute's' only and ask Bushire if they can be provided with passages to Karachi at-theip-expenee by debit to Bushire. We will forward the statements and undertakings for the refund of the amount to Bushire as udual. This is the usual procedure, when Indian destitutes apply for repatriation etc. ° ^“aft submitted.- 1 K •z. Repatriation of Shipwrecked crew. K.R. No. 1 of 1925 and 2 of 1925 are in connection with Pilgrim ships only. Article 2 under K.R. 1 of 1925 and article 5 under K.R.2 of 1925 clearly state that the 'Act' shall only apply to pilgrim ships with British Registry. The instructions at page flagged 'D' in the B.O.C. also are silent regarding relief to destitute shipwrecked crew. As it is doubtful whether we can act under the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, the crew' have been repMriatd by debit to Bushire. Merchant Shipping Act 1894 applies as far as Part XIII i s concerned which is irrelevant here. Indemnity bonds have been taken from all the crew and the statement of the Nakhuda is also recorded.

I dicharged the goods there and shipped dates and reed mats. The dates for me and my crew for their families at Dubai, but the reed mats for Haji Salman bin Ahmed bin Salman of Bahrain. On Friday the 9th of April 1943, I left Basra in ray jollyboat with 10 crew, all of whom are Dubai subjects. On Saturday morning while I was speaking to the coaxwain one of the crew drew my notice to the fire v/hich came out between the mats in twoplaces - one near the mast and the other near the beam of the stern deck- and v/ithin few minutes the fire rose high in the sky. The sailors began to throw v/ater on the fire and jettison mats in the sea, but that was of no avail, becuase it spread all over the deck and the boat broke into pieces. One hour before sunset the sailor hauled down the small jollyboat in the sea and they put out the fire, which caught it. Seven of the sailors clung to a floated piece of the boat, and I with three others got into the small jollyboat. Before sunset I saw the seven crew, but lost sight of them after sunset. XXk We remained in the jollyboat 28 hours, and then we were drifted by the tide to the shore of Bushire. The accident took place off Khari. We were taken to the Con$ulate-General, ^ I''”'' * Bushire, where we reported the matter. The Consul arranged for a launch to go out to the seas and bring the missing sailors, but unfortunately a strong gale blew, and the Nakhuda of the launch could not risk Tit. The gale continued for five days, after which there was no hope of reovering them. All these days we were in Bushire waiting for a lift a steamer. We weresent by yesterday's steamer to Bahrain because it does not call at Dubai. If you approve I will allow the Nakhuda to go to bazaar and report the matter to the consignee of the matfe, and.then arrange for them to leave to Dubai by a launch leaving today (if it has not left) Such arrangement will save us the trouble of expenses until they are picked by another steamer. yMt ' E i- f</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00006b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1372</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00006b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1372</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 12/5 Wrecks of sailing boats and vessels in the sea and salvages’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1929/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-10-01T21:01:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">per</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (282 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.

The correspondence relates to: reports of the initial incidents; the salvage of cargo; rescue and repatriation of crews; the recovery of costs incurred by salvage and repatriation; insurance claims. The principal correspondents in the file are: the Political Agent at Bahrain (numerous incumbents); the Director of Customs at Bahrain (Claud Cranbrook Lewis deGrenier); the Residency Agent at Sharjah, who reports on shipwreck and salvage incidents on the Trucial Coast, or involving boats from the Trucial Coast.The file includes details of numerous individual cases. The most significant cases in terms of paperwork involved include:the sinking of the
                              Surabnear Bushire in February 1931, with correspondence relating to: the repatriation of the crew back to Karachi; the Karachi authorities’ demands for repatriation costs to be paid by the
                              Surab’sowner, leading to a dispute between the two parties (ff 8-30);a collision between the British India Steam Navigation Company steamer, the
                              Varsova, and a fishing dhow in the waters between Qatar and Bahrain, with correspondence relating to: the recovery of eighteen crew from the dhow, which sank after the collision; failed attempts by the dhow’s owner, a Qatari subject, to make a claim in Bahrain over the loss; the Ruler of Qatar, Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī’s intervention in the affair (ff 95-124);the foundering of a vessel, the
