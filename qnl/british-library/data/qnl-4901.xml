A connected and authoritative history of the East India Company's con nection with the Persian Gulf is still a desideratum, which this Summary and Selections are intended to meet to some extent. The period covered by them is exactly two hundred years beginning with the enterprises of the pioneers of the East India Company in Persia and closing with the Embassies of Mehdi Ali Khan and Captain John Malcolm to Maskat and Persia, with which there dawns a new era in our dealings with the Persian Shah and the Arab Chiefs of Eastern Arabia, a political as well as a commercial policy superseding a purely commercial policy that had been pursued previously. The Summary of Events from 1600 to 1800 is taken from the following materials: — (1) Turchas Bis Filgrimes. —[Purchas, the first histriographer of the East India Company, brought out the materials supplied to him in this work, out of which we have utilized the journals of Monox and the Company's other Agents in connection with v Persian affairs,] (2) jBruce's Annals of the Bast India Company&gt; three volumes (1600 —1708).

In wading through these volumes I have found the Press List of the ancient documents preterved in the Record Office, 1646—1700 prepared by the Bombay record office, useful in putting my finger on the papers connected with Persia. The Catalogue of the Secretariat Records, Bombay &gt; 1630—1780, is of some use in putting one in the way ; but it is far from being exhaustive, and omit to indicate the pages of the huge volumes, most of which are not blessed with an Index oi List of Contents. : L[ m ] A few of the Selections are reprinted from Forrest's Selections, which con tain, however, a meagre collection concerninsr Persian affairs. About 25 of the extracts are reprinted from the Bombay Government Precis in regard to Turkish Arabia, mentioned above, in which all the extracts except one have been adapted to our modern mode of spelling. This accounts for the fact that the Selections are intermixed with extracts that bear the stamp of spelling followed at the present day. The letters and extracts printep in this volume are numbered consecutively with Roman numerals, which are also shown in the Summary. We might draw attention here to the following appendices printed at the end of the Selections :—• Appendices A —^.—Farmans and statements of farmans, etc. Appendices F, G and Zf.—Important reports on the Commerce with Persia and Arabia. Appendix I, —List of Company's Agents. Appendix J'.—Glossary of words. The list A collection of translations of farmans dating from June 1627 to July 1629, given by the Persian Kings and Governors, which appears to have been sent by the Agent in Persia to the Company, is printed as Appendix E to the Selections. From a letter, dated 24th February 1756, addressed by the Agent and Council, Gombroon, to the President and Council, Bombay, it appears that a translation of all important Persian grants and Phirmaunds was forwarded to the Presidency in 1756; but no trace of this can be found in the Bombay records at present. From paragraph 248 of the Bombay Government's despatch to the Court of Directors, dated 8th April 1758, it is evident that a translation of all the important grants and Phirmaunds obtained in the East India Company's favour relative to the Bombay Presidency and its subordinates was forwarded to the East India office in 1758, including it is presumed the Persian Grants and Phirmaunds. This collection cannot, however, it is reported, be found in the India Office records. The history of the East India Company's connection with the Persian Gulf divides itself with the following periods, which aie indicated in the Summary 1—1600—1613. —The preparatory period, when attempts were made by Sir Bobert Sherley to induce the British, particularly the East India Company, to open tr ade with Persia, and the proposals on this subject were discussed. JI~~1614—1617. —The period when the first steps were taken to open this trade, which ended with Edward Connock, obtaining the first important grant of our commercial privileges in Persia. The progress of Connock's mission was considerably obstructed by his second Barker, who was greatly responsible for the sus picions and fears with which Sir Thomas Roe regarded the mis sion. The bickerings between Connock and Barker and the misapprehensions of Sir Thomas Roe gave rise to much corre spondence, which throws side lights into the state of Persia and the enterprising spirit and character of the pioneers of the Bri tish commercial enterprise in Persia.[ IV ] 111—1618—1622—^1* period is occupied by the missions of Barker and Monox to the Court of Shah Abbas. They could obtain for the East India Company hardly anything beyond the grants given to Connock, though they were backed up with all the assistance that Sir Thomas Roe could command. The wily Per sian monarch by grand promises entrapped them into an agree ment to assist the Persian in the capture of Ormuz from the Portuguese. This important event gave a death blow to the Portuguese supremacy in Persian Gulf and paved the way for the establishment of the British and Dutch as rival commercial powers in the Gulf. Period IV, 1623—1629. —During this period was opened the East India Company's factory at Gombroon, which was the centre of British enterprise in the Gulf until 1763. Shah Abbas deputed Sir Eobert Sberley and a Persian Ambassador to King James. In response King James sent Sir Dodmore Cotton with Sir Eobert Sherley to the Shah. Sir Dodmore Cotton's Embassy from King James to the Shah ended abortively owing to his death in Persia in almost abject poverty, neglected and uncared for as he had been from the beginning by the East India Company. The project of this Embassy was opposed by the East India Company, who had more confidence in their own Agent Burt than in Sir Dodmore Cotton, a friend of Sir Robert Sherley. We find in modern times a parallel of this case in Sir Harfard Jones' Embassy from King George III to the Shah in opposition to Sir Malcolm's mission to Persia on behalf of the Governor-General of India. Feriod V, 1629—1642 corresponds with the reign of Shah Safi, a King who was a liberal patron of foreign enterprise in the country. But the London East India Company's affairs suffered much from the intrigues of the Dutch and the rival enterprise of Courten's association. To protect the trade from both these rivals the Company sought a more secure port and found it in Basrah in Turkish Arabia. Feriod VI, 1643—1657. —During this period the London East India Company had to carry on a severe struggle with the Dutch, who become the predominant power in the Gulf. The civil war in England ending in regicide was deftly made use by the Dutch to lower the prestige of the English in Persia. Feriod VII, 1657—1681. —The wars in Europe, the embarrassments in Persia and the obstructive tactics of Persian authorities, contributed to depress the English trade to such an extent that the Court determined in 1663 to with draw their factories from Persia, leavnig only a few servants at Gombroon for the purpose of collecting their moiety of. customs. The exertions however of Mr. Rolt appointed agent in Persia in 1668 under the advice of Gerald Aungier, the able President at Surat, helped to revive our trade with Persia. Feriod VIII, 1681—1698. —A new plan of trade was now tried with a view to bring about commercial intercourse between the Gulfs of Persia and Arabia. It was determined to send an armed expedition for the purpose of enforcing our privileges. Though the expedition was diverted in order to quell rebellion in Bombay, the vigorous measures taken to check the Dutch intrigue ssecured us the confirmation of our privileges and the favour of the Persian Kings and Governors. The Armenians, who commanded the silk trade in Persia, were given a share in the Company's business. The Company opened a permanent agency at Ispahan. We hear now for the first time of the formidable power of the Maskat Arabs on the sea. Period IX, 1698—1708. —During this period the English influence in India suffered much by the struggle between the English and London East India Companies, but it was a period of comparative progress in the English trade in Persia. In 1697 Ispahan was made the chief settlement of the Company in Persia, to which a visit was paid in July 1699 by the Shah who had renewed their privileges. Period X, 1708—1736. —Anarchy and confusion reigned in Persia on account of the Afghan occupation of the country and the English trade suffered considerably and their Agencies at Ispahan and Garmania were withdrawn. The Basrah trade deteriorated on account of the wars of Tamasp Khan (afterwards Nadir Shah) against the Turks. Period XI, 1737—1747. —Corresponding with Nadir Shah's reign, when the Company s affairs on the whole prospered. Their agencies were re-estab' lished at Ispahan and Carmania. The East India Company was very much exercised over the pressing demands of the Shah for naval assistance against the Turks and the maskateers to evade which it had to resort to many subterfuges. Period XII, 1718—17o7, —Nadir Shah's death was followed by anarchy and civil wars, and the Englisn trade suffered immensely. Their agency was finally withdrawn from Ispahan in 1750. The Carmania trade came to a standstill. The Dutch opened a factory on the Karrak island in 1754 and the British one at Bandar-Ig in 1755; the latter was destroyed within a few months by Meer Mohana after murdering his brother Meer Hossein, who had been favourably disposed towards the British. We now hear for the first time of Mullah Ali Shaw, the famous Persian admiral with his head quarters at Gombroon. The star of Karim Khan was at the close of the period on the ascendant in Persia. Period XIII, 1757—1762. —The struggle between Karim Khan and his rivals ends in favour of the former. The islands of Kishm and Ormuz, and the port of Gombroon become the scenes of constant disturbances owing to feud between the Beni Main Arabs and Mulla Ali Shaw. The oppressions of Jaffer Khan, a brother of Nasir Khan, the chieftain of Lars, leads the English to decide to abandon Gombroon. In 1759, the Erench, who were at war with the English, capture and destroy the English factory at Gombroon. Period XIV } 1763—1769. —The East India Company's Agency and Council was withdrawn from Gombroon and established at Basrah in 1763, and a factory and residency established at Bushire, under a grant of pridieses from Sheikh Sadun, a brother of Sheikh Nasir of Bushire, and a fresh grant from Saduk Khan confirmed by bis brother Karim Khan. The Dutch Factory at Karrak was destroyed by Meer Mohana in 1766, while the English Residency was withdrawn from Bushire in 1768. During this period the English con ducted operations— firstly against Ormuz ; then and against the Kaab in co -operation with the Turks and for some time with the Persians.[ VI ] (2) Against Meer Mohana in co-operation with the Persians, which was however so half-hearted and ill-managed that our forces effected nothing, while a revolution drove away Meer Mohana from Karrak, and opened the way for its occupation by the Persians. Period XV, 1770—1779.—This was the most eventful period in our connection with the Persian Gulf. We may mention here the leading events of the period :— (1) negotiations with Karim Khan rendered abortive by the antipathy displayed by Agent Moore against the vakil and against Mr. Skipp, who was deputed to Shiraz to conduct the negotiations ; (2) plague at Basrah in 1773—74, when the agency was withdrawn from there; (3) seize and capture of Basrah by the Karim Khan's forces under Saduk Khan, 1775—76; (4) re -establishment of the Residency at Bushire in 1775 ; (5) reduction of the Agency at Basrah to a Residency in 1779. Period XVI, 1779—1792.—On the death of Karim Khan, Basrah is abandoned by Saduk Khan and the country becomes a prey for several years to civil wars. The East India Company's trade thrives both at Basrah and Bushire, though its progress was much retarded by changes in the Govern ments. The British influence becomes now paramount in the Gulf. Period XVII, 1793—1800.—^ Kajar dynasty comes into power in Persia. The French scare opens a new epoch in our Persian and Persian Gulf affairs and Embassies are sent to establish our political influence as against that of the Erench at Maskat, Tehran and Baghdad.

The Summary and Selections, with the appendices and the works referred to above will, it is hoped, supply a complete material for writing an exhaustive' and connected history of the East Indian Company's connection with the Persian Gulf from 1600 to 1800, when the foundation of the British com mercial supremacy in the Gulf was laid, that paved the way to the establish ment of political preponderance in the 19th century. The Selections give us vivid pictures of the struggles, anxieties, troubles, victories of the sturdy Britons that fought their way through the most tremendous difficulties, and obstacles, that would have unnerved and driven back but the most enter prising and doggedly persevering characters. It was a long hard obstinate struggle of nearly two centuries, from which only the bulldog tenacity and courage of the British nation could have emerged successful. At the beginning of the 17th century the British could get a footing on Persia only through a distant outlying village, Jask; the beginning of the 19th century found them the masters of Persian Gulf. It is the drama of this interesting period of the British connection with the Persia and the Persian Gulf, that will be found unfolded, however inadequately, in this Summary and Selections, J. A.

THE SECOND PERIOD 1614—1617. STRUGGLE WITH THE PORTUGUESE. THE CONNOCK MISSION TO PERSIA. When the English Factors first repaired to the Mogul Court, their broadcloth found a ready sale and in consequence a large quantity ordered from England, which was more than could meet requirements. Demand falling to a mere fraction of the estimate ; Aldeworth on the lookout for markets and he discovered one in Persia. There, he was told, they might be sure ' of the vent of much cloth, in regard their country is much cold and men, women and children are clothed therewith some five months in the year.' This information obtained from one Richard Steel, who had come overland in pursuit of a run-away debtor and had been persuaded to await at Surat the coming of the expected fleet. The matter was brought before the Council of Factors at Surat and it was resolved to despatch Steel to Ispahan accompanied by a Factor called Crouther to procure further information and to solicit a/amaw 'for the fair and peaceable entertainment of our men, ships and goods in all such ports as they shall arrive at.' The two gentlemen were to go to Ajmere and thence proceed to Ispahan with the necessary funds for their expenses ; they were furnished with letters of recommenda tion to Sir Robert Sherley, who had recently returned to Persia by way of Sindia (Lahari Bandar) and Ajmere from a roving mission to the various European Courts (1608-13) as the Shah's representative ; after fulfilling their mission Steel to go to England with their report to the Company and Crouther to return to India with a duplicate thereof. Jasques a convenient pe«% ' a little within entrance of the Gulf of Persia at a headland ... and not so much in danger of the Portuguese as Barreen'. King of Persia likely to fall out with the Poituguese and favourably disposed towards England; Sherley ill-treated by Portuguese at Sindia, is received at the Mrgul Court very honourably, and told Kerridge that if the English did not come to Persia, he would bring the Dutch. Captain Dawton refers to his former meeting Sir Robert Sherley and appeals to their friendship, recommends Steel to his consideration and entreats him ' to move the King, and know His Majesty's pleasure, whether he will grant and give his firm and chop for the subjects of the King of England to have free intercourse and peaceable commerce throughout all his dominions, which if His Highness will grant, then it may please him that Jasques may be prepared by his directions for the courteous entertainment of the English, when it shall please God to send any of our ships thither, as also for their quick transportation from thence to the Courts and other places as occasion shall import.' (1) ' Jasques' —Net fortified and ' is only a fisher town,' and 3 leagues ofE is the seat of the Viceroy of the province (Ormuz province). (2) Damone ' (Bandar Abbas ? )—best and strongest among Persian King's dominions; lies 3 leagues off and opposite Ormuz, (8) ' JBatan' (Bostahfch ?)—35 miles within Ormnz with a good road and a small island near it protecting from winds. (4) ' Bareyne Island on Arabian Coast, taken from the Portuguese by Persians, who keep a garrison there. (5) ' Rashire ' (Eeshire)—80 leagues from Ormuz, well fortified with five fathoms of water on one side, 7 on the other; 100 frigates and galleys kept here to cut ofi all passengers that offer to go from Ormuz to Bassora ; hath a navigable river for boats of burden to go to Sharase in eight days. iV.JS.—(a) All ports of Persia are free from dacbe or customs, but only toll on beasts of burden leaving the country.

Prospects of Jasques as a port for trade on the Indus, its mouth being the Sindhu (in Sind), and for Persian trade. Sir T. Roe proposes to ascertain the possibilities of the Persian trade to send an agent to make enquiries and if he gets a commission from His Majesty to proceed to Ispahan to settle the matter personally. Shah Abbas expels Portuguese from Ormuz (Gombroon), where they had established themselves in 1512 to secure provi sions for their settlement at Ormuz ; Shah Abbas overrun Georgia with fire and sword. Farman (printed t page 524 of Purchas Pilgrims, Volume I), procured by Steel and Crouther from Shah Abbas ordering the Governors of seaport towns to receive and assist any English vessels that might present themselves. [Copy of this farman sent with letters of Steel and Crouther to Aldeworth and Kdwards, reached Ajmere on 10th February 1616, but former dead and latter had left for England. Sir Thomas Roe opens the letters and writes to East India Com pany.—See introduction to the work mentioned in column 1, page XLVIII.] In Sir Thomas Roe's opinion the benefits of this farman overestimated, as there was no provision for fortifying a port, and there was no possibility of securing trade. The Persians expelled the Portuguese from Bandel (Gombroon) before intelligence of the Turkish invasion, but now the latter event happening and Sir Robert Sherley having returned from Spain, was heartily welcomed by the Shah, and was now being sent on a second mission to Spain to conclude a treaty, by which whole monopoly of silk trade given to Spain (the object being to divert its transit by way of Turkey) with right to re-fortify Bandel and some other ports, and Spain to send yearly a fleet with spices, pepper, Indian linen, etc., in exchange partly, but for most part ready money. The danger to the English trade is very great, if Sherley succeeds. Roe has written to the Shah. Sir Thomas Roe thanks the Shah for his farman, refers to His Majesty's mission to Spain with instructions to permit Spain to fortify ports in the Gulf which only recently the Shah had purposed to free from bondage and open to all nations. If monopoly be given to one nation the English would be compelled to force their way by arms and thus there would be disturbances in the Gulf and ruin of trade would follow, advisibility of opening a free mart on the Gulf open to do all nations. Sir Robert Sherley's previous mission a failure. He had pro mised much more in England than he could perform. He had left Spain in discontent. His present mission to Spain was the consequence of the war between Turkey and Persia, the success of which the sequel will declare. The benefits expected by trade with Persia ' I know no more than he (Sherley) promised.' t Reprinted as Append ix A.V- IV summaryt. Kame of the book or Volume of the Beoorda.

It would be useless to send a mission to Persia until the issue of Sherley's mission to Spain were known; the farman obtained by l&gt;teel and Crouther was of little value, as it con tained no undertaking on the part of the Shah to aend down silk to Jask, and no merchandise was obtainable at that port in the ordinary way. Opening of trade with Persia by .Task.—Its advantages, as com pared with the Portuguese monopoly of sea trade and the route by liahari Bandar and bind to Persia. The Surat Factors determine to open a factory or factories in Persia inspite of Sir Thomas Boe's opinion to the con trary as expressed in his letter brought by Pepwell. Reasons : {a) Present opportunity a good one, seeing that Sherley was away, who would either be a troublesome enemy or an expensive friend ; (5) the war between Turkey and Persia having blocked commercial intercourse with Europe by Turkey, there must be plethora of silk, and dearth of cloth in Persia ; (c) it was necessary to find vent for the large stock of goods at Surat; (c?) the port of Jask conveniently situated and one ship would suffice for defence against a Portuguese attack; {e) the ship that comes from Europe might go from Surat to Persia and return in a few weeks without extra cost to the Company ; {f) the ship that oomes from Bantam with spices might after landing spices required at Surat, discharge the remainder at Jask, where spices were supposed to be in demand. Roe's opinion set aside with the remark that ' in regard His Lordship in other particuWs of his said letter is far transported in error of opinion con cerning merchandising and merchants' affairs in these ports makes us assured that he is no less transported from and concerning his Persian employment'. Edward Connoch, cape merchant of Pepwell's fleet was chosen ' chief over all Factors and factories that shall he in the said Persian employment until the Company's pleasure be further known therein,' Thomas Barker his principal assistant, and George Pley, Edward Petters, William Tracye, as other assistants, aud Robert Gipps as linguist. The James, under command of Alexander Child, was told to convey the party to Jask with the goods ordered. The expedition in the James to go to Jask, and under the authority of the Shah's farman land the goods there, after consulting the local Governor. Thence remove the goods to a town of greater safety against the Portuguese and robbers ; then Connock to proceed to Ispahan with all speed and after presenting the Shah with His Majesty King Janoes' letter (blank letter filled in), and offering him suitable presents try and obtain grants of privileges. If two factories are to be established, the Chief to be under Connock with Pley as second, the other to be under Barker with Petters as second. N.B, —The Surat Factors call Jask a small maritime village and are aware of its disadvantages. The above mentioned party with cargo to be conveyed to Jask, or next most convenient port, adjoining thereunto, and on arrival at that place, Child should not keep the James there more than 25 days, and return to Swally Road. Answer of 'William Robbins from Ispahan, who informs that 'Sir Robert Sherley hath confirmed a peace with Viceroy at Goa,' that 'except Shah Abbas be assured that we will fetch all his commodity by sea, he will not lose his other ways,' and that there was no use fending him such goods as he disliked, and prejudicing him against us, and driving to the Spaniard or Turk. Had Sir Thomas Roe been made privy of the projected expedition to Jask, he would have prevented the hazzard they ran.' He would now inform the Shah through his Ambassador at the Mogul Court that the English ship went to Jask only to ' see the port and show our forwardness;' Sir Thomas's grounds for objecting to the project: (1) great expense of carrying silk from North western Persia (Georgia andGilan); (2) the dangers to which the caravan would be exposed through Lars and Baluchistan ; (3) charges and troubles at Jask same as at Surat; (4) on the close of the Perso-Turkish war, the silk trade would pro bably take the shortest and easiest course to Enrope through Turkey by way of Aleppo. It is of importance that Sherley's mission to Spain should be brought to nought; Spain should be warned that exclusion of other nations from the Persian Gulf in its trade would be a casus belli.SUMMARY.

Summary, Sir Thomas Roe to William Robbins at Ispahan, 17th January 1616 (—17). bsxibxb. Jask too remote from centre of Persian marts of silk trade etc.; no profits could be expected this year ; for future suc cess all silk must be purchased from King's hands half with money and half with commodities. To secure this very costly, as Sherley who leaves Goa for Europe (in December) is trying to obtain this monoply to Spain. The Factors received Crouther's and Steele's joint journal of their observations in their travels, but neither particular or general advice of hopes or despair of trade in^ Persia. The Factors acknowledge Roe's ' honourable care in the further- ence of the Persian business.' Sir Thomas Roe's reasons against the Persian Mission- la) Jask is a small town—with absolutely no trade ; (6) the way to Persia from Jask is dangerous on account of banditti; (c) goods taken except cloth not vendible ; (d) the port exposed to Portuguese attacks; (e) Jask too far from the fountain of silk trade and other marts ; {d) Connock not an honest man, as Roe thought from reports received (see ). It would be advisable to recall the mission or to let it wait at Jask, until Roe obtains the necessary privileges through the Persian Ambassadar at the Mogul Court and by writing to the Shah. Roe not disposed to wrangle—'I had rather he (Kerridge) proved a wise man to the Company s profit than rash to their loss and his own aharae and so will study how to prosper his designs, rather than demonstrate his folly ' (pa^e 319). It would cost an euormous sum to transport the goods sent by the James from Jaak to Ispahan—there are no merchants in Persia who would purchase whole-sale. ' This experience made me deal with the Ambassador to agree with the Shah as for our cloth and silks at a rate ; that if he desire our com merce, he send to port' (page 330). A note of three laud soldiers taken out of the James to serve the Factors in Persia: Thomas Stevenson 20s. mo., Nic. Russell, 15s. mo., William Blundeton, 10s. mo.—the first as cook, and the two others as apprentices for being merchants. The James to return to Surat Roads, but if weather unfavour able for that purpose to proceed to Bantam. Roe visits the Persian Ambassador at the Mogul Court and ' propounded to him the settling of a trade, the conditions we required, the commodities to his master and our forwardness in sending a ship this year to J ask upon his master's farman.' The Persian Ambassador answers that his King would welcome all Christians, but that Sherley had been sent with offer of the ports to Spain. When the dangerous conse quences of this were pointed to him he decides to write to the Shah about them and also the wishes of the English. Sir Thomas Roe acknowledges receipt of letter from Robbins (jeweller at Ispahan), explains that the purpose of the des patch of the ship to Jask only 'to show our forwardness,' not purposely to settle at the place, 'but to try and settle our entertainment' (Note. —This was Roe's diplomatic way of explaining the despatch of the James, the cargo of which, he feared, would disappoint the Shah, see his letter to Sir Thomas White, dated 27th November 1616, above noted). It was necessary in the first instance to defeat Sir Robert Sher ley's mission by warning Shah Abbas against selling his coun try to a nation like Spain. What the English desire is (1) a port open to the English alone or to all nations indifferently, where they may land goods, and such privileges as are requisite in such cases ; (2) ' some agreement be made and set of prices indifferently on both sides according to the conditions of the commodities ; (3) the King's silks be brought to the port or some convenient town in the interior not far up as a staple mark. Sir Thomas Roe appeals to Robbin's nationality as an Englishman and his religion as a Protestant versus Sherley's religion as Roman Catholic and ' in hie Practices but luke warm ' and presses him to use his influence in the interests of the English. ■, I ^SUMMARY. vii Name of the book or Volume of the Becorde.

George Pley, to Thomas Kerridge at Surat (Ispahan), 15th May 1617. Proceedings of the Persian Mission after despatch of goods from J ash to Magustan. Detention at Magustan by the dodges played by the Governor ; after receiving several presents from the English he seems to have received bribes from the Purtuguese with a view to detaining the English. Connock immediately proceeds to Shiraz to procure orders for release of goods at Magustan from the Khan. Letters received by East India Com pany, Volume V, pages 137—-140 (page 139).

The party then leaves behind two broad cloths and is allowed to depart. 11th March. —Party arrives at Lar, staying there 9 or 10 days. Had Barker visited Governor at once, not more than 5 days halt wonld have been necessary. 2nd April. —Arrives at Shiraz, where well received by the Khan ' Barker having been appointed to make his residence there with some quantity of goods to make trial of that place, immediately seen.ed no longer to be commanded but to have sole power of himself to do as he listed,' disobeys Connock's orders and detains goods at Shiraz for 25 days, camels were then laden with some goods but the best of the goods were detained at Shiraz, which were, badly required at Ispahan for being taken as presents to the King. Private trade in which Barker is engaged, details of which transaction are summarized on the introduction to Volume V. ' Thomas Barker had taken with him from Surat to Persia a quantity of ginger, etc., on his own account. In the course of the journey from Jask to Shiraz, his fellow Factors needing money for the hire of camels, agreed with him that part of this siock should be sold on account of the Company, and the price obtained should be credited to him and paid from the first funds available. This bargain gave Barker a clear profit of 150 per cent, on his outlay. On reaching Shiraz, however, he found that prices there ruled so high that had he retained his stock he might have doubled his profit; whereupon he claimed, and endeavoured, though vainly, to enforce payment from the Company's cash at the rate of 300 per cent, profit, in lieu of 150 he had before agreed to accept.' As George Pley remonstrated against this bargain, he was abused by Barker being ' called threadbare, beggarly, prying knave, puritan knave,' etc. Petters, who had been appointed second to Barker was ordered by the latter three days after Fley had left Shiraz to go to Ispahan, Barker preferring to keep William Bell, whom he liked. Fetters at first refused, but as Barker threatened to tie his legs under the horses belly and send him away, be left to join Pley on his way. Petters describes Barker '* He is so turbulent and proud a fallow and hath so overweening a conceit of himself, that at Surat they were right glad to be rid of him. He presumed much on my Lord (Sir Thomas Roe). I must confess he is a man of good abilities, but so proud that no man he thinketh to be his equal.' Speaking about Connock, Petters says ' May it please you my opinion is that Mr. Connock will effect the business, is employed about to the King gracefully, to your worship's credit and content and during his time here the charge of an Ambasador may be saved. This boldly I daresay of him: he is a worthy, able and sufficient gentleman and forward in your negotiations. Much wronged he hath been by Mr. Barker, who hath left' no means unattempted (yet cunningly) to hinder his honest designs in your affairs and to overthrow his credit.'

Points the great danger to the English trade if Sir Robert Sherley s mission to Spain succeeds. Connock, in anticipation of orders, proposes to warn the Shah of the danger and dishonour to Persia of the proposed agreement with Spain, to point out that silk being the chief trade of the English by way of Aleppo they would challenge Spain's pretensions to divert it to their sole benefit, to shew to him that English shipping being more powerful than that of any other nation. Connock hopes by these arguments to induce the King to sell the English a large quantity of silk, and urges a commis sion being sent to him to conclude a treaty with the King. Connock also proposes to urge the Shah to possess himself of Ormuz Island which could be easily done. Page 193 . . George Pley, to Edward Connock at Ispahan (Shiraz), 4th April 1617. Pley brings to Connock's notice the charge hurled against him (by Barker and his faction) (a) that Connock styles himself Ambassador ; (i) that he is extravagant in expending Company's money ; (c) that he on some difference caused one of Company's servants (Bell) to be treated with violence by the . native people.

(2) The charge of prodigality is an invention of William Bell, his (Connock's) accounts will show the truth, necessity only has compelled him to borrow, he has been sparing, but discreet in his expenditure so as to maintain his dignity and reputation. Connock urges Pley to hasten to Ispahan ' for till then I cannot depart to the King, nor peremptorily will I engage my life by delivering an old letter and treat a counterfeit business, except you enact it there and confirm secrecy by your oaths. The King is a tyrant and cuts off heads every hour,' It was necessary to anticipate the Spanish Ambassador. Page 200 • Sir Thomas Eoe, to Thomas Kerridge at Surat (Mandoa), 25th April 1617.

Portuguese (Spanish) Ambassador (Don Garcia DaSilva) has airived at Ortcuz, which place he will probably soon leave on account of its heat. The writers yet reside in the forepart of the ruined house (King's), which is inconveniently situated, and have asked the Darga to give them the house wherein Connook had put up ; no presents yet given to Khan's Vazir, orders asked o£ Conoock. Danger to a single ship coming in these parts, as the Portuguese are bent upon confentrating their whole fleet against the English, necessity therefore of warning the next fleet coming of the danger, commoditiea vendible in Persia, etc. Refer to several previous letters. Their charges against Barker :— (а) Barker's delays and wasting his time in frivolities, notwithstanding Connock's repeatedly writing to expedite his journey, and remitting 600 dollars to Bell, in order to enable Connock to visit the King with necessary presents in due time before Spanish Ambassador arrived. (б) Though the party had to borrow money, 'Barker exacted out of the cash and of George Pley at that money's arrival, the value of 180 reals of eight, pretending the same for commodity of pepper, cloves, ginger and other his private trades (to me formerly unknown) and left not one other hundred dollars to serve all our occasions.' (c) Barker ill-treated Petters for disapproving of his ways and sent him to Ispahan, though he was desirous of staying at Shiraz as his second according to the commission (see above) and detained Beil to serve his own ends. (d) Barker detained at Shiraz the best of the goods which would have been suitable for presents to the Shah, or would have had a good sale at Ispahan. Connock desirous that the next English fleet should come to J ask and land all the cloth it brings with the ready money and certain other articles. {See list.)

Refers to his previous letters—which were also in alphabet (cypher P) to secure knowledge from Portuguese who lay in wait at Bagdad to intercept English letters. They have asked the Consul of Aleppo to send one or two trusty Arabs for carrying letters. ' By them we may from time to time boldly and securely direct our letters to that Consul, to whose conveyance we can hut recommend them. ' Sale of the goods at Shiraz, and Ispahan. Some cloth sold at Shiraz, but the goods at Ispahan reserved for a whole-sale bargain with King's treasurer ' he lately came and hath offered us one-fourth money and three-fourths silk ; but he cometh not near our price of cloth. Our cloths are too high priced or too dear bought for this country.' As to prospects of future trade they have proposed to send 4 or 5 hundred bales of raw silk to Surat, for which they expect to get in ex change sugar and other Indian commodities, an exchange which would yield 300 per cent. From Bantam, they have called for a yearly ship of 500 tons of spices—of English com modities there would demand in Persia for 1,000 broad- cloths, 1,000 coloured Kerseys, of all fresh colour, 1,000 Devonshire Kerseys, 100 tons of tin, 20 chests of quick-silver, 20 barrels of vermilion, which the factors request to be sent in the next fleet. They desire also that a ship drawing 10 or 12 feet of water should be sent with the fleet of ' good defence against frigates or two or three galleys.' Connock proposes to hasten to meet the Shah in 6 days in anticipation of the Spanish Ambassador (Don Garcia DaSilva) who had come to Persia, with many and rich presents.

Page 286 Edward Petterg, to Robert Middleton, merchants, London (Ispahan), 2nd June 1617. Describes the movements of the Factors in Persia. 'Ispahan is the chief and principal city of the Empire and seat of the King, to which place the subjects and merchants of border ing princes, by land as well as by sea, from most parts of India {Ormuz the port town) have commerce and trade. The Portngals do receive thereby a great custom and benefit by report worth more than the toll they have in any of their towns in India ; yet of late years much impaired to what it was. I hope to live to see their pride to have a fall and that town to come to nothing, which is the desire of this people. They are generally hated here ; the reason they have been so perfidious base lying people. By reportt the King ha + .h spoke publicly that they never yet told him a true tale. There is better expectation for us. We have more courteous use ol the common people than ever they had, and more respect of the great ones.' The friars in Ispahan are trying their utmost against the English prospects of trade in Persia. * One Rohbins, a jeweller, misrepresented by Steel, very influential at Ispahan, has proved very useful to the Factors.

Describes the reception of the Persian Mission by the Shah ; the Spanish friar having stealthily left Ispahan for the Court, about which Connock got intelligence only five days after his departure. Connock hastens himself thither with Robbinp, Tracye following with the goods; Connock and Robbins, arrive there two days after the friar's arrival ; after a good deal of bribing of the King's officials, audience is given by His Majesty to the Mission, only after ten days' waiting. King James' letter presented in presence of the friar and the Shah satisfied as to its genuineness ; the Shah drinks to King James'health. A few days afterwards Tracye arrives with the goods and presents are offered to the King, who accepts them with joy. The Shah replies to King James and gives a farman which granted nearly all the English demands * The Shah offers to give credit to Connock for 3,000 bales of Royal silk to pay for them in goods and moneys even after their own manner, whereby to give life to our trade's beginning ; asks for certain articles to be sent for presents to the King. [Read the whole of this interesting letter.] Above despatch sent to Aleppo by a trustworthy messenger and Consul asked to send it carefully and with all speed by way of Marseilles or Holland at any cost. Asks for certain kinds of cocks, Turkey cocks and dogs to sent for presents to the Shah. The Persian Ambassador Mahomed Razaberge left the Magul Court on 10th January 1616-17. Referring to Connock's Mission, Koe warns Robbins that the King should n^t' judge ns by this attempt, which was rather to show our affection than any proof of our abilities' inasmuch as ' Connock was sent from Surat, as a factor to begin and make offer of the amity unprovided either of instructions, goods or means fit for such an enterprise ;' no trade conld be started by the English 'unless a port he secured, a mart established, prices agreed for such quantities on both sides as that neither be deceived, a straggling, peddling, uncertain trade will neither profit nor become so great nations.' Sir Robert Sherley is not a friend of the English and enemy of the Portuguese, as Bobbins supposes. His actions belie his professions, ' nor that we will take Ormuz and beat the Portu gal out of these seas; these are vanities. The Company intend a trade, not a war, but in their own defence and that bravely and honestly.' It is proposed that Pley should proceed at once to Jask in advance to meet the fleet if it comes there, to give warning to it if there be likelihood of Portuguese attack, etc. Roe quotes the opinion about the Persian trade of an Italian, who had long resided in Persia and met him. The Italian thinks that Persia is not tierra de negocio ; all the traffic lay between Aleppo and Casbin for silk and money ; the English cloth will not have a good sale. 'The disposition of the King is to be very familiar with strangers if they be in cash. In hope to get, no man can escape him, when he hath sucked them, he will not know them.' The Company has entrusted Roe more than he is willing to undertake. In regard to Persia the Company wishes to follow a cautious policy, so that he was not willing to send a fleet or goods to Persia before he received more advice from a soberer man than Connock (Connaught), who has been sent there without his knowledge. ' I am of a nature not to hurt,' 'so Roe prefers ' to help out' a rash venture undertaken by the Surat Factors. RoeSUMMARY, xiii Name of the book or Volume of the Becords.

(iVo#e.—This fleet_ brought the despatch from the Company with the commission and instructions to Roe about trade in Persia and King James's letter to him. M ore powers given to Hoe especially in regard to Persian trade. He proposes not to send any ship or goods to Persia having received no news of Connock's mission. [Mote. —The letters which Connock despatched from Ispahan in May did not reach Ahmedabad until February 1618.] Roe there fore intends to send a ship to get news of Connock and i Commission as to conditions to treat on. The enterprise of Persian trade not to be neglected, but as nothing had been heard of Connock's mission, it was not desirable to send any goods this time, but if the Surat Factors preferred otherwise he had no objeotion. ' But that we must not let the project slip. I am resolute in, first not to disgrace our nation, next to relieve our oontrymen, who will expect us, and to take a judicious experience of the profits and possibilities of that trade.' Roe prepared to consent to and confirm whatever Captain Pring, Kerridge and other merchants shall think it requisite to be done. Authorizing Connock, Barker, Pley and Pell to conclude a commercial treaty with the Shah according to instructions that will be duly forwarded. Principal points to be observed-— (1) To have special regard to the Company's limitations and to weigh well the objections out of England to the trade [e.g., that it might ruin the trade by way of Turkey in the hands of the Levant Company]. (2) To consider whether Jask or any other port be fit and secure for ' our ship ' under a fort and to contract to have such forts repaired and maintained at the charge of the Shah, for which they may consent to pny an import duty of 3 per cent. (8) To consider well the strength of Ormuz, whether one ship may safely trade, as the charge of a fleet to defend her will not be borne ' lest you fall into our in commodity of Surat, and this one thing I fear alove all other.' (4) To contract for a settled residence within one month's journey at farther from the port, whether the silks may be brought; for this Shiraz supposed to be most convenient for the sale of English cloth and other commodities. (5) To contract with Shah or his merchants for the price of silk, all that commodity belonging to the King and they may venture to give 7^. §d. sterling per lb. for it. (6) The goods of any Englishman dying in anv part of the Shah's dominions to be free from molestation. (7) To contract for guards for the transit of their goods in places of known danger. (8) No English to be imprisoned for debt, except it be proved. (9) Ships to be supplied with provisions at reasonable rates. (10) To inform themselves of the prices of all sorts of jewels, drugs, etc. Articles for their private directions [a) Live soberly and frugally. (&amp;) Be sparing in presents to every Governor ' nor at Court flourish and brave atfor the King, however affable and courteous, will suck you and when you are left empty will not know you. (c) The charge of house-keeping cannot be limited, but five could live on £100 a year. ((?) The proceeds of goods to be shipped regularly. (e) Only one to carry the above commission and instruc tions ' it being just and reasonable that the)-, who have begun this negotiation should be esteemed as most worthy and sufficient to continue it,' (f) If Connock or any other has taken the title of ambassa dor or spent Company's money prodigally or misbe haved himself outrageously, he should be removed from the service. Roe 'not so in love with mine own opinion ' gives discretion to Captain Pring and Kerridge to modify the above instruc tions as they think it fit.xiv SUMMART.

True inventories of the estate ,of the Factors dying in the Company's service parti cularly of William Tracye, and the goods and moneys or debts of the late Edward Connock to be seized for the use of his creditors and the Company. Roe orders a ship designed for the Red sea to bring off silk from Persia ; ' What is passed I will not asgravate nor tread on the dead, whose vanity and follies, waste and irreligion I did too jus ly suspect. To the business your freedom and admittance is very fair; the next consider is how you may securely use this trade hy want of a port and compass it without export of great quantities of money ; for, doubtless, if to be done, it is the best of all India and will yieid you most certain profiV. Roe advises ' composition ' with the King of Spain, without which English trade would be preca rious on account of the Portuguese influence and opposi tion in the Gulf ; Spain could not rightly exclude England from free trade in Persia. Conditions on which trade could be carried. Eoe acknowledges the King's letter dated 4th February 1617, which he had received in October 1617. 'Negotiations begun last year without his knowledge by Connock's mission; supplemented by liis own letters to the Shah in which he had communicated to the Shah His Majesty's desires; have resulted in a very noble letter of the Shah to His Majesty and the grants of large and ample privileges to the English, which were procured by Connock. There are, however, other difficult points on which negotiations will be necessary. Portugal is not wise enough to know its own weakness, ' who would rather enviously hinder us than like noble enemies hurt us.' Want of a peace between Portugal and England ' makes all these trades ot India and hopes of Persia heavy and dangerous to the undertakers.'SUMMARY. XV Name of the book or Volume of the Becords.

Summary, Our Eaat India Company have contracted with King of Persia to bring their silk by the Persian Gulf, paying one- third in money and two-thirds in commodities. This will undo the Turk, who bring that for 150,000 C., by the year which costs Christiandom 800,000 C. News from Aleppo that the King of Persia had overthrown the army of the Turk and slain most of his men, the rest escaping with great difficulty back to Turkey, that the Persians had prohibited the sending of any more silks into Turkey and refused to deal with the Spaniard for the same, but continued constant in his promises to the English. Letters to be written to the Factors in Persia to capitulate with the Emperor that no nation should intercept the English but that he would forbid all others trade by sea, and to let him know that the trade shall be furnished. Arrival of the Sophy at Ispahan in June 1819 ; presentation of King James' letter with presents in time of ceremony at a magnificent State banquet to which were invited all Foreign Ambassadors resident in his Court, viz., the Spanish, Indian, Turkish, Russian, Tartarian and Uzubeck. The Shah promises to adhere to the treaties with England or Spain, but this assurance he limited to the term of his own life. After the retirement of the Ambassadors the Shah promises to redress the English grievances. Great attention shown to the English at the Court; ' sometimes he would secretly whisper unto us that he had a secret resolution to take Or muz from the King of Spain and deliver it wto the English naiion.' The Armenians and others who had previously exported silks and other Persian goods by way of Turkey use all their endeavours to hinder the English in their trade. A profitable trade may be made in Persia without dealing in silks; privileges granted to them (the English) by the King ' that they may have the whole trade of his gulf for silks, that they may surprise Portuguese ships, that the real of eight shall be current at the mint value and not as heretofore at a sixth part thereof, that the house they live in be confirmed to them that they may freely buy silks ot the King's subjeots.' Two English ships (Bart and Eagle) proceeding from Surat found Jask blockaded by four gailions, large galley, 16 frigates of Portuguese under command of Admiral Ruy Frere. The English ships return to Surat, joined by the London and Boebuck, attack the Portuguese ships—indeci sive engagement—Portuguese ships proceed to Ormuz and return with reinforcement—obstinate conflict—English victorious but lost their Commodore Captain Shillinge. This victory raises reputation of English. Mr. Monox, Agent, despatched caravan from Ispahan, which was stopped by Khan of Shiraz at Magustan with the object of inducing the English to join against the Portuguese. At Jask in Decem ber 1621, ships prevented from taking cargoes. The English then agree to comply. Terms proposed by the Agent and Council, Surat, in con nection with the projected capture of Ormuz. ' First, in case God shall be pleased to deliver the Island and Castle of Ormuz into the hands of the Persian by our aid, the moity of the spoil and purchase of both to remain to the English, the other moity to the Persian. Secondly the Castle of Ormuz to be delivered to the possession of the English, with all the ordnance, arms and munitions thereto belonging, and the Persians to build another for themselves at their own charges. Thirdly, the customs to be equally divided, the English to be for ever Custom free. Fourthly, that all Christians captives should be at the English'disposing, the Muesalmans at the Persian. Fifthly, the Persian to be at half the ships charge for victuals, wages, wear and tear, and to furnish them at his charge with sufficient powder and shot. Divers other articles were concluded to be presented to the Shaw; after his coming to Mina, Master Bell, and Master Monox, the eight of Januaire were sent to him and entertained with a sump tuous banquets, a greatfeast and triumph was also made for the joyful news of the King's taking in of a great country in Arabiaj and of Awaia, the chief city of that country.'SUMMARY. xvii Purchas: his Pil- grimes, Volume II page 1793.

The third granted, provided only, that the King 's and Duke's goods from India should also pass Custom free. To the fourth, they made reservation of the two principal Captains, Ray Frera, Captain of Kishim Castle, and Simon de Mela, Captain of the Castle of Ormnz, till the King's pleasure known. Other articles agreed on, and ordered also that no change of religion should be admitted on either side ; and charges of powder and shot to be divided. The Duke and Master Bell signed, and presently the English goods were laden on the Duke's own camels on hire cost, which before no money could procure. * An expedition consisting of English ships and Persian army sent against Ormuz. Attack chiefly conducted by the English and the city and castle taken on 22nd April 1622. The surrender was made to the English and the Portuguese Com mander Ruy Frere and the principal officers were sent prisoners to Sarat. The English received portion of plunder, grant of the moiety of the Gombroon customs, treaty of 1615 made by Mr. Connock was renewed, phirmaund f granted by the Shah allowing the English to purchase whatever quantity of Persian silks they might think proper in any part of Persia and bring the goods to Ispahan without paying duties. Claim of King and Duke of Buckingham (Lord Admiral by right of his office) former to a proportion and latter to j^th of the prize money taken at Ormuz and elsewhere from Portu guese. The Company resist the latter claim as they had acted not under letters of morgue from Lord Admiral, but on the charter. Evidence taken and prize money ascertained at £100,000 but not taking into account the cost and losses of the Company, Claims compounded by paying the Crown and the Duke £10,000 each.

The Dutch interference and presents to King, but withont effect and prejudice against the English. Sir Robert Sherley in England proposes a commercial treaty between England and Persia on the basis of the English supplying materials to the Persians to construct armed vessels to protect trade, tonnage to the Persians to transport silks to England, give them vessels on hire. The Company opposed because the character of the Persian Government shifting and naval support of the English might be turned against them selves ; Persian credit low and any mutual transactions of fnrnishing tonnage or lending ships on hire inpracticable. The Persian trade at low webb, exorbitant prices demanded bv the Persian merchants for silks and other native goods. The Agent and Council at Ispahan resolve to wind up. The King intervenes and offers to present them with two out of ever) 100 loads of silk and purchase all the Company's cloth. The Agency resolve to wait orders of the Court.

' Consultations of the agent (Thomas Kerridge) and Council at Gombroon, January, to February 10, 1625. ■' ]_$t % —Question as to whether trade with Persea should be renewed, decided in the affirmative having regard to the Company's affairs and privileges and to the fact that the Dutch had intruded themselves and ' scanda lized our intendments unto the Sophi.' 2nd. —The Persian Government had abandoned Ormuz (except the castle) and proposed to make Gombroon the chief port. The Portugals burnt boats along the coast. The Khan of Shiraz demands English assistance against the Portuguese at Muskat, on the basis of the agreement at the taking of Ormuz, by which it was stipulated that the English shipping should clear the passages of the Gulf and sustain moiety of the charge. The Persian Government had paid moiety of the cnetoms of Gombroon for two years, the Dutch only refusing to pay the customs. For the ptesent the Persians were occupied in the siege of Basrah, and the English did not expect they would proceed against Maskat. So it was resolved not to deny the assistance demanded, especially as the Dutch had solicited the Sophi to eive Ormuz to them and might anticipate the English by assisting the Persians. 3rd, —The Sultan of Gombroon demanded English aid with ships against Basrah. This is denied by the Agent and Council, as being against the Turks. The Persians contend t^iat the aid is required against Portuguese frigates hovering about Basrah, but all being of opinion that it was a mere device to engage them in wars against the Turks, it was resolved not to give any aid in this design. ^A.-—The Sultan of Gombroon then urged the performance of the articles in which the British agreed to secure the ports and passages against the enemy, who would shortly make an attempt at regaining Ormuz. In answer he was told how the Persians themselves had greatly failed in performance of the said articles, particularizing the unjust division made at Ormuz (60,000 tomans accounted for as moiety of the Shah, while the English got only 6,000 tomans. They received only three months' pay while entitled to 8 months, the ordnance taken, 165 brass pieces, was treble that accounted for to the English). Promised to write to the Khan of Shiraz after their return from Shiraz, whether they were repairing; in the interim Barker to know of the Sultan, what he would give per month for the stay of our fleet till August. The Sultan profers half the expenses, which means victuals only. # After two days' fight with the Portugals, the Sultan of Gombroon appeals to the Dutch and English. The latter decide to stay on the same conditions as the Dutch, if the latter agree to stay upon an agreement of salary. The Dutch refuse to make any longer stay. The Sultan agrees to pay 500 tomans per month to the English. But the Commander of the fleet shows that there was no sufficient powder and that only three of our ships could not stand against eight Portuguese ships. So it was decided to set sail with the Dutch to Surat, leaving Barker, (chief Agent), Pureflc (second), Benthal (third), Robert Loftus (fourth). 6th. —The Agency to endeavour to get moiety of Gombroon customs, as compensation for past services not future services. If Ormnz is offered to the British, an express to be sent to Surat and orders awaited from England. 119. Captain John Weddell to the East India Company, 27th April 1625. Ormuz beseiged by the Portuguese fleet under the command of Euffaro. Bravery of the Persians in deferding Ormuz. Ruffaro ruined many of the forts between Gombroon and Park.

Letter despatched with Nukud Ali Beg, Ambassadar, who is sent to King James to desire nothing but His Majesty's love and that he would command his people and merchants to come freely into Persia to buy or sale or do what they please and none should dare to force any bargain upon them. The Persian Ambassador had audiance with the King on 6th March and should have had it fortnight earlier but for his outrageous assault on Sir Eobert Shirley, on the plea that the latter was an imposter and abused his Prince's name. Sir Eobert Shirley had arrived previonsly with a commission from the Persian King, and had been received as an Ambassador, when arrived Nukad Beg who disavowed Sir Eobert Shirley as an imposter. The King had resolved to send Sir Robert Shirley with Sir Dodmare Cotton to Persia at the expense of the Com« pany, as great danger was apprehended to their interests in Persia and as Sir Robert was greatly exasperated on account of the treatment he had met with from Nukud Beg, attributed by him to the incitement of the Company. The Court petitions the King not to send Sir Robert Shirley on the proposed mission and not to qualify him in any sort. The King answers that this resolution is constant to send Sir Eobert to Persia ' for he coming to England as an Ambas sador and being received by His Majesty in that condition, he conceives lesser favonr cannot be afforded him than to return him thither to clear his honour.' The Company would have to bear only the charge of his passage. The Court resolves to undertake to pay none of Sir Robert's debts, but only to transport him, his wife and servants to Persia. The King had resolvred to send Cotton as Ambassador with Sir Eobert. The Court does not wish to undertake expendi ture of an Ambassador, but would undertake to carry him as a private gentleman. Negotiations with the famous Persian merchant, who has brought large quantities of silk for sale in England. He maintains his independent right to deal with the silk without reference to the Persian Ambassador. While the Court tells him that Mr. Cotton was to be sent as King's Ambassador, but that the Company had no intention to employ him, and had entertained one Mr. Bart, who had ample powers to conduct their business. The Persian Ambassador in straits for money, and the Persian merchant refuses to advance him funds. Assuming the character of Ambassador from the King of Persia Sir Eoberc Shirley applied for compensation of £2,000 for his exertions in endeavouring to establish trad# between Persia and England. The Court of Directors, however, contended that instead of services, they had experienced only injuries frotn Sir Robert Sherley. Sir Robert then requested the Privy Council for permission to return to Persia, stating that in that country he would discharge his duty to his new Sovereign (King of Persia), without forgetting his obligation to his natural Sovereign (King of England^. Necessity of building a fortress in East Indies greatly felt, not practicable to build one at Ormuz or to get independent hold of Maskat in Portuguese lands. The situation of Company's affairs in Persia very precarious. The Shah defending Baghdad against Turks. The Dutch allowed a proportion of silk trade on more favourable terms than the English. Company receives 300 tomans or £900 as moiety of Gombroon customs. Sir Dadmure Cotton arrived at Swally Eoad with Sir Robert Shirley and his lady. The Persian Ambassador died a day before the fleet arrived at Swally Eoad, and the Persian merchant a few days later. The late coming of the fleet prevented the ambassador from going to Surat. He left in the William for Persia, leaving Sir Robert Shirley in the Star. Pour ships (the Exchange, Star William, Hart) sent from Swally Eoad to Persia, which carried nearly 300 passengers mostly Persians.XX SUMMARY. Name of the book 6t :p Volume oi the v-&gt; Records.

Death of Sir Dadmure Cotton on 23rd (P) in the city of Kaghin after only presenting King Jame's letter to the Shah. His extreme want in things befitting his dignity. Death of Sir Robert Shirley also in extreme want. SAa/i Safi renews the Company's* privileges, but valuable presents (worth about £1,500) had to be given him annually. Shah's reply to King Charles's letter ; 20,000 tomans worth of silks had to be bought by tbe Company from the Shah. Rebellion in Persia and plunder by a Georgian Prince affected silk trade, no stock of silk kept by Shah as by Shah Abbas. Large diffusion of silk over Turkey and Russia. Gombroon becomes a large dep6t for silk. Moiety of Gombroon customs 550 tomans. Dutch incur displeasure of Shah. The project of inducing merchants to bring silk to Gombroon fails, as the goods purloined are on transit. Want of funds and cloth to meet liabilities on purchases, especially Maslipatam cloth for which much demand. The English against their wish obliged to co-operate with the Khan of Shiraz against the Portuguese at Maskat, or otherwise the Dutch would. Agents to avoid similar embarrassment ask for powers to occupy a place, where they could retreat in an emergency. Trade in JPersia •practicable only by contracts with the King ; private individuals having neither credit nor being trust worthy. Large quantities of silk carried into Turkey, notwithstanding phirmaunds, moiety of Gombroon customs 242 tomans. Shah given up to dissipation and little prospect of his protec tion. The Dutch offer high prices and profuse bribes. The Persians, it is feared, would insist on cash payments, as Indian cloths not much in favour. Moiety of Gombroon customs 342 tomans. Proposal to give up the claim and accept an specified allowance. No encouragement to be given to interlopers from England. Truce between the Portuguese and the English concluded at Goa. Convention between English President of Surat and Portuguese Viceroy on 20th January 1635-36 on basis of treaty between England and Spaurof September 1630. JVew experiment of sending a pinnace, with a small investement to Basrah (under Turkey). On account of uncertainty of the Persian King's phirmaunds, proposal to try and' secure Persian silk in Persian ports by sale of Indian and English goods. Mr. Gibson, Agent at Ispahan, however succeeded in renewing contract with the Shah for 3 years and for Ghilan silks. Mr. Gibson died, and it was found from his books that he had applied Company's money to his own profit and lent £12,000 to Dutch, enabling them to bear down English trade; neces sity of a reliable Agent felt. The Dutch, however, indebted to Armenian merchants to the amount of £100,000 and export of silk by them stopped until debt discharged. President Methwald returns to Europe, and the new Presi dent Mr. Premlin stops at Gombroon on his way, reports Persian trade not rightly understood, broad cloth better sold at Snrat than Gombroon, purchase of silks on ready cost system more profitable. Proposes new set of regulations. * Customs at Gombroon inconsiderable from the low state of trade and from collusion between the English Commanders Factors on share and Persian officers (which Agent suspected) Ettaman Dawlat Vizir favourably disposed but Shaw- bandar inimical to the English. King Charles' letter and pictures of English Eoyal family presented to the Shah, which produced good effect and secured new contract for silk, and a phirmaund to recover debts due under an old contract. Effect of the new Regulations introduced by the new President at Surat and his orders to sell off furniture at Ispahan and concentrate trade at Gombroon began to be felt. Persian Government rot likely to enter into a new contract. Customs at Gombroon had annually decreased from fraudulent dealings of Shaw-bander and from misunderstanding between the Shah and the Great Mogul, who had prohibited his subjects from trading to that port. bbmasks. * Far man -printed on page 293 of I ett e r s received by the B.

Captain Swanly despatched to the Persian Gulf with a fleet of five ships to act against the Portuguese and increase trade with Persia. The fleet conveyed the Mogul Ambassador to Persia. Trade injured by the Ambassador carrying frds of goods on the fleet as presents to Shah, by which payment of customs at Gombroon was evaded and Company's moiety reduced. FIFTH PERIOD, 1629-1642-SHAH SAFI'S RElGr NT- STRUGGLE WITH THE DUTCH- FACTORY OPENED AN BASRAH. The Portuguese make vigorous attempts to revive their influence in Persia and the Gulf. Two phirmaunds obtained by the English to bring silk from Ghilan to Ispahan, but rebellion against the new King and the Company's goods plundered. Phirmaunds of Shah Abbas rendered void by his death. Order from his successor for 200 soldiers to defend Gom broon against the Portuguese, who obtain license to trade to Cong, while the English get license only to purchase 1,000 bales of silk. Mr. Thomas Rastell on his way out from England to Surat to assume the office of Chief of the Company there, proposes to visit the Persian Gulf and consult the Factors there. Measures for improving the Company's trade in Persia in competition with the Dutch. Instead of making Surat the last port of the fleet's final ' disport' for England, they are determined for this year only to alter that course by appointing Persia for their last port. The first Persian voyage. Sharp action between the English and Portuguese off Swally Roads. Collection of Gombroon customs. Defeat of the Turks by the Persians. Small preparations of the Portuguese in matters of trade and against the Company. The Dutch obtain preponderance at the Persian Court by bribes and large stock. Necessity of maintaining the Agency at Ispahan, which was continued pending Court's orders. Necessity of fixing Residency at Siraz on account of intense heat at Gombroon, where great mortality among the Company's servants. Moiety ot customs 500 tomans, which, if force were employed, would increase to 6,000 tomans. Courteu's association greatly detrimental to London East Indian Company's interests. To protect trade from the Dutch and Courtens association Messrs. Thurston and Pearce sent to Basrah, under Turkey, where the Dutch influence would be counteracted. They arrived at Congou April 1640 and at Basrah on 3l8t May 1640. License obtained from Pasha to land goods. Not very good prospects for Europe goods as Portuguese had landed large quantity. Permanent factory should be estab lished to gain Pasha's confidence. Civil war in Turkish Arabia renders project of a factory at Basrah difficult. Customs at Gombroon yielded the Company 7LiO tomans, though real moiety ought to be more. The Dutch intrigues and rivalry of Courten's association, situation of Gombroon factory, irregnlarities there, continued burden of making presents to Shah to procure phirmaunds on each distinct subject had frequently made charges exceed profits, yet the Agents determined to preserve right to customs at Gombroon. SIXTH PERIOD, 1642-57, KEEN STRUGGLE WITH THE DUTCH. Death of Shah Saphi in May 1641: He is succeeded by Abbas. Attempts to renew Fhirmaunds {according to usage) on the whole successful, despite the Dutch intrigues. Dekkhan and Coromondal goods more profitably sold than English produce, in the disposal of which East India Company undersold by Persian merchants who got English goods direct vi&amp; Alleppo.

Presidency at Surat resolved to maintain the trade in the Gulf owing to these circumstances. Persian trade decreased from silks not being so much worn in England on account of Puritanic influences. Customs income to the Company 600 tomans. Factory at Basrah unmolested by the Dutch, prospering by exchange of English luxuries for the wealthy people of Turkey for goods commanding sale in England. Quantity of goods sold amounting to R811:96:50. The markets being bad, the stock will not be sold till the beginning of the next monsoon. Pattamar (cossid or messenger) has been despatched to Aleppo with the letters direct to the East India Company. The Dutch employ a large fleet in the Gulf and attack castle of Kishm. Persians offer to make peace and grant favourable terms of trade. Dutch Commander Block proceeds to Ispahan (where he dies afterwards). Shah gives license to the Dutch to purchase silks anywhere in Persia and export them free of customs. The Dutch despatch fleet of 8 ships to Basrah and almost ruin English factory. Factory at Gombroon in very precarious condition, customs income 616 tomans. Dutch influence paramount in Persian Court. Dutch Commander (Block) demands restoration of 4,900 tomans extorted from Dutch Agents on former occa sions. To avoid consequences of war with Dutch, Company's ■property removed to Basrah. In spite of almost exclusive grants of the trade the Dutch obtained by force in 1645—46, the English persevere and obtain in 1646—47 three phirmaunds from the Shah (1) releasing them from payment of 4 per cent, on goods sold at Ispahan, (2) authorizing to re-build their house at Gombroon, which had been destroyed by an earthquake, and (3) for regulating the payment of custom's at Gombroon. These favours attributed to appointment of a new Vizier. Trade at Gombroon might have revived but for arrival of one of Courteris ships there ; for Shaw-bundar received the Com mander and allowed him to land goods without paying customs. 0 Trade in Persia more precarious than at any former period on account of expense for phirmaunds and failure of imports of pepper and spices from Surat, so necessary to facilitate purchase of Persian produce. State of the trade at Basrah. The pattamer (cossid, messenger) sent to Aleppo has not yet returned. The despatches that shall be received from the East India Company will be for warded to Surat with all speed. Trade between Surat and Basrah unproductive from superior means Dutch possessed in engrossing it ; an approaching war between King of Persia and Mogul diverted Persian land trade by the Gulf and provided much shipping to Dutch and English. Factory at Gombroon precarious. Customs income 635 tomans. Persian trade affected by war between King of Persia and Mogul decreasing demand for English cloths and spices not having been received at Surat from Bantam for the Persian market. Yet profits more considerable than in any preceding season (4,000 tomans or about £12,000). The Dutch para mount in the Gulf and obtain additional phirmaunds. Customs at Gombroon deficient. The Agents ascribe this to rumours of civil war in England and the execution of King Charles, which disgusted the Persians with the English, and which it was apprehended would induce Persian Government to break off league with the English and stop moiety of customs based upon treaty made with the King of England and collecte in his name. bekabes. fV Summary. xxiii Name of the book or Volume of the Records.

King of Persia invades Mogul territory. The rumours of the Company's dissolution induces the Books of Pasha to seize the English Factory ; Trade in the Gulf at a stand.* In this state of things the Surat Presidency propose to obtain possession of Maskat ; as this would give the English command of the Gulf and provide a vantage place to overawe Gombroon; negotiations commenced with the Governor of Maskat. It was proposed to place a garrison there of at least 100 soldiers. But the negotiation did not result snccessfully State of the accounts at Goombroon. Trade at Basrah. Certain demands from the Bashaw of rah. Dispute regarding the Companys* house. To convey George Cranmar and Robert Sainthal to Gombroon. The Surat frigate to sail to Basrah with cloth, pepper, lignum. Advice as to conducting sales at Busrah, etc. Eequire&amp;ents of the shipping in the Persian Gulf. Death of Mr. Foster and return of Agent Buckeridge. Appoint ment of Kichard Craddock, Agent in Persia, George Cranmer, his second, and William Eolt as another assistant. InBtructions as to how the Agent should proceed. He is to proceed to Gombroon in the Hopewell, make himself acquainted with the Company's affairs there, inform the Shah-bander his arrival, so that he might be received with due respect; insist on payment of the moiety of the customs at least 1,000 tomans. Death has been so familiar among the Company's servants at Gombroon on account of the heat and unhealthiness of the place, that the Agent might absent himself either at Shiraz or Ispahan during Summer. Instructions as to sale of goods at Basrah and Gombroon. Interruption in Persian trade on account of war in Europe and political embarrassments in Persia on restoration of peace. The Court forwarded a letter from the King to the Shah and ordered translation of collection of phirmauds made by the Agent, and attempt being made for a new phirmaud from Shah ; 1,000 tomans received as moiety of Gombroon ens boms much below the expected amount. Carmenia wool to be more strictly inspected before being despatched. the Il0ndon East India Company with the merchant adventurers shortly afterwards (1657) put an end to oneSUMMARY.

For several years Company had in a great measure relin quished Persian trade, and only intercourse kept by Gom broon Agent to keep up claim to customs. In 1668—1669 Mr. Rolt appointed Agent in Persia, to receive instructions from Surat Presidency, which was instructed to make an estimate of the number and kind of armed vessels which would be required in Persian Gulf to protect trade and enforce payments of Gombroon customs. Persian trade still precarious but considered of such import ance that the Agent in Persia recommended grants of land in Bombay Island to Banians as inducement to open commerce on large scale between Persia and Bombay and Surat. For purpose of recovering moiety of Gombroon customs armed ships should be sent as did the Portuguese to enforce payment of moiety of customs at Congo. The Company's rights in Persia cannot be enforced without force. Mr. Rolfs Mission to Persian Court a failure. Services of Rolt duly acknowledged. The Persians can never be brought to do justice by presents or forbearance. Demand of the Khan of the Company's ship for carrying troops rightly refused; charges of certain factors of ill-usage by Mr. dhild; molestation of merchants by Persiar officials; trade in certain articles. 8883 F.

Trade between Surat and Persian Gulf in 1677—1678, had worn better aspect, imports and exports, to and from Gom broon, having turned out more profitable. Mr. Aungier having died, Mr. Rolt, Agent at Gombroon, appointed to the Presidency and for the agency at Gombroon. Great regret expressed at death of Mr. Aungier, for it was due mainly to his talents, integrity and zeal that carried a succession of difficulties, that the trade in Persian Gulf and elsewhere was preserved for 16 years.

The Presidency preferred negotiation and treaty to hostilities, compounding of customs for 3,000 tomans to appropriation of customs. In case of hostilities mere blockade was the only course left.SUMMARY. xxvii Name of the book or Volume of the Beoords. Name of documents or papers. Summary.

EIGHTH PERIOD 1681-1698 NEW PLAN OP TRADE. ARMED INTERVENTION. THE ARMiiNIANS. THE MASKATEERS. New plan of trade to connect the trade of the Gulfs of Persia and Arabia {Bed Sea) projected ; Dragon (180 tons) to proceed from England early in season to Socotra whence three country vessels with aloes and vendible English goods to proceed to Mocha, and after disposing of English goods and securing cargo of coffee and olibanum there, go to Gombroon to meet Dragon and receive instructions which were to be sent overland. Dragon not to remain at Gombroon more than a dav, but to proceed to Hasrah and having disposed of English goods and coflree and olibanum, return to Gombroon and having taken in Persian goods sail to Surat. John Gibbs appointed agent at Persia to superintend this trade, with a council of fonr, who were to succeed by seniority in event of death or removal. Persian trade on the decline for series of years from superior naval force of Dutch and from hesitation of the Company to try anything hut negotiation. But this season they determined to adopt more spirited measures and to equip a fleet to second representation to Shah. Letter of remons trance addressed to Shah, with a threat to employ force if treaties and phirmauds should be continued to be violated, and moiety of customs and debts (£1,000,000) are not paid. Company decide to send large stock in furtherance of new scheme, also one ship of Berbadoes sugar sent to Persia to be refined and sold as purer and more pi'ofitable than Bengal sugar hitherto sent. Court's scheme of combining of Persian and Mocha trades found impracticable, as Mocha supplied with Europe cloth by Armenians from Surat, Basrah with cloth from Aleppo and Gombroon and by French and Dutch ships, and in the circumstances Mocha coffee and Busrah silks could more profitably become part of Europe cargo, obtained by pur chase. Appearance of a small ship like Dragon lowered reputation of English, while the two large Dutch ships annually sent to Gombroon tended to increase their reputa tion, hence necessity of sending two large English ships to the Gulf well armed and well stocked, and manned by Europeans like Dutch ships to impress Persians with security. Court decided to send armament to Persian Gulf (1) to recover arrears of Gombroon customs (estimated at 150,000 tomans or £450,000) and (2) to make King of Persia to fulfil existing treaties between England and Persia. Minister of Persia favoured this project in order to resist Portuguese who had offended him by their insults ; at this time English armament sent to East Indies to restore old King of Bantam and English factory ; a portion of this fleet was to proceed to the Persian Gulf under Sir Thomas Grantham [as to instruc tions to Sir Thomas Grantham, see page 501.

The object of the expedition to Bantam having been answered by peaceful settlement, the squadron intended for Persian Gulf, was diverted to proceed against interlopers. Company's trade at Surat and Bombay having been unhinged by the revolt in Bombay, Persian commerce a disconnected subject. As to the new project of combining Mocha and Persian trade, the agents at Gombroon and Ispahan reported that basis of thia project or sale of English produce at Mocha, Husrab, etc., had failed, or was impracticable. Further they stated that the orders foi Persian goods at Ispahan and Gombroon could not be complied with, for the exports could not be despossd of to purchase an investment of silirs Carmania wool, etc., but if proper agents with sufficiem, stock should be employed at Ispahan, these articles might be procured, for the ships of the following season under the risks of interruption of privileges, and the uncertainty of their being renewed. Orders of the Court that two of the Council at Gomhroon should constantly reside at Ispahan to attend to the Company's interests there. The East India Company were ready to send ships and an adequate stock provided Persian goods should be embarked on English bottoms only and that the customs should be regularly paid. Company fits out a large ship, the Charles the Second with 60—70 guns, Commander Sir Thomas Grantham, with a King's Commission, and to have a vote in the Council at Surat while at that port ; object to recover Bantam, or if this be found impracticable to proceed to the Persian Gulf and by the appearance of force to endeavour to establish the Company'n rights at Gombroon, etc. At this time Bombay undergoing convulsions of a revolt, to suppress which Grantham was called after visiting Gombroon. Hut before this visit to Gombroon the Dutch had blockaded tbat port in consequence of a dispute with the Ettaman Dawlat (Prime Minister) about their silk contract and stopped the Mogul vessels going to port and taken Persian goods. Owing to this interruption customs not recovered. On Sir Grantham's arrival off Gombroon, the Dutch fleet bad left, while presence of Persian troops prevented him from using force, so he set sail to Bombay. A small quantity of Carmama wool sent to England. Agency at Gombroon of opinion that refined sugar from West Indies could not compete with sugar brought from Bengal and in a refined state from Maskat. A considerable force having been collected in the preceding season for the reduction of Bombay, discretion allowed to the Presidency to utilize it to inforce the Company's rights in the Gulf [but it was not so employed]. Salt ordered to be sent to Samatra from Ormuz island in ships coming from Persia; Agents in Persia censured foi not informing the Court about the war between the Persians and the Dutch and for neglecting to let out the Company's ship on freight during the war which would have yielded consider able profit. Regular information to be sent to England by way of Aleppo every six weeks, as the Interlopers secured earlier intelligence of events. Application to be made to King of Persia to encourage shipping of Persian trade on English bottoms, with an offer to contract for -whole of the silk and Carmania wool purchased formerly by the Dutch. The Persian Agency, however, to be guided by the President or the General and Council at Bombay. Intrigues of the Dutch to create a misunderstanding between the Persian Court and the English ; but by the efforts of the Company's Armenian linguist at Ispahan, protection to trade and confirmation of the -privileges at Gomhroon, had been obtained. Company s affairs in critical state on account of Interlopers, favoured by the Mogul, and the intrigue of the Dutch. Sir John Child despatches two of the largest ships to Mocha and Basrah to seize all Mogul vessels, under the command of Captain Charles Andrews ; one Interloping and six Mogul vessels under Dutch colours detained by Captain Andrews.ZZJ SUMMARV.

In the state of hostilities, trade at Gombroon could be carried on a limited scale: provision was made of various kinds of guns, and English cloths (had they been of proper colours and qualities) might have been disposed of 1,000 half pieces annually; but as the Armenians bad brought cloth from Turkey in exchange for silk, it was inferred that silk could be procured more advantageously by barter for cloth, than by money. Encouragements were' to he held out to the Armenians to settle in Bombay, by offering them protection, and a profit able market, and allowing them to send their goods in Com pany's shipping. [iVote—Armenians at this time carried on trade in India on their own funds and credit and travelled largely.] The Armenians being also principal merchants in Persia, similar encouragements were to be held out to them to bring silks and Carmania wool to Bombay, to be sent to Europe, as part of the Company's investment, by which means they would receive greater profits than by sending Persian produce, through Turkey to Aleppo. This system was expected to create a large stock ready to be shipped to Europe and arrive to pre-occupy the market, before the Dutch imports could depress the market. Every exertion made to obtain exclusive trade of silk, by bartering broadcloth for it, imitating the Dutch practice of exchanging the finer spices for silk. Similar method being tried in case of Carmania wool, thereby hoping to dispose of 2,000 pieces of English broadcloth. The Dutch were rivalling the English in the market by imports of Indian goods, but they were not respected much by the Persians and the English hope to check their trade in Carmania wool. English trade checked by appearance of an English pirate vessel in the Gulf, the crew of which had plundered the Portuguese factory at Cong. The Company's ship Cms cur sent to capture it, returned unsuccessful; Persian Govern ment refused to stipulate customs. The war between the Company and the Mogul did not affect the Persian trade to the extent feared ; English superiority at sea, the Persiacs expected, would secure the ultimate victory, Carmania wool and Persian silks to be purchased by barter for English cloths. Demand to be made for arrears of Gombroon customs. The Armenians to he allowed to load their goods on the Company's ships-, pur chase to be made of whatever quantity of wool and silks as coald be obtained with a proportion of warm seeds, rhuburb, lapis lazuli, and surplus stock to be sent to Bombay. Though the Dutch had made a common cause with the English in Europe, their oppositition to the East India Company's trade in the East continued ; after the war between the Company and the Mogul had ended, the Persian Government, though admitting the Company's right to the moiety of Gombroon customs, pleaded that during the late war trade had been diverted to Cong (a Portuguese port) and the customs had decreased at Gombroon ; The agent fearing that the Persian Government demand compensation as a set off against the moiety of customs, fought only the payment of the arrears and obtained from the Shah-bandar promise to pay one year's customs and the remainder when it might be practicable; the Agent received 1,995 chequins and again 1,500 more, though two years' customs were still due. Arrival of a Dutch Ambassador on Persia, who represented the English situation in a very unfavourable light, that the Stad-holder of the States General, now ruled over England, that their phir- maud for Surat trade was a poor grant, etc. He sought the monopoly of the wool and silk trade. Agent proposes that the Company should obtain a letter from His Majesty to the Shah and send it with suitable presents to refute the lies. The Agent to use every endeavour to prevent the Dutch Ambassador obtaining exclusive monopoly of Persian wool and silk trade and to extend the British trade. If the Armenians engross the silk trade, they were to be allowed to transport the silks to Europe in English bottoms. Sale of broadcloths should be pushed through the Armenians ; 3,000 pieces of broadcloth were imported at this time to Persia. Their sale to be extended by selling them more cheaply. The Dutch Ambassador did not succeed in obtaining the mono poly he had sought, but had so far gained on the Shah-bandar and the broker, as to obstruct sale of English produce at Gom broon, which obliged the agent to despatch the goods brought by the Rebecca to Ispahan. No payments of two years' customs received.XXX SUMMARY - . Varne of the book or Volume of the Records. Nature of docnments or papers. Brace's Annals, Volume III, page 123.

Agent to proceed to Ispahan in order to concert measures with the Chief of the Armenians for promoting Company's interests and to provide accommodation for certain young men who had left England for Persia for acquiring Persian and Armenian languages and qualifying themselves in the Company's business. The Civil Establishment in Persia was augmented and was to consist in future of a Chief, four Factors and four writers, and the factories at Gombroon and Ispahan to be permanent. The Chief was to reside at either place. Thp writers of this season were to reside in the houses of Armenians and study their language and study their business methods. This increase of establishment was necessitated by more extensive operations required for vent of English goods for which sale had become restricted in India. King of Persia had offered the sale of the whole of silk to Armenians for yayments to be made within three years. The Agent empowered to purchase ^rd of the silk from the Armenians, provided they would agree that the remainder should be put on the Company's ships for the Europe market. The reason for this order was the increase of prices of silk on account of interruption of the Turkey traffic by the French war. English cloth to be sent to the Armenians at Julfa for being bartered for silk, or ready money, or for even ^ in money and f in silk ; as much wool as possible to be purchased. The Company's ship Berkley Castle having been sunk by the French in the channel, which had prevented the despatch of the Ist ship this season, the Court ordered that the Company's ships were not in future to touch at Cong, but to go direct to Gombroon, and all the lower country vessels were to be sold, as they had been attended with an immense expense and risk. Though insinuations against the Armenians had been received, the orders for fulfilling the contract with them were continued, because the Court conceived that the Armenian shipping in India would be of material advantage as the duties which they paid at Fort St. George alone amounted to a larger sum than what had been received from the Consulage at Gombroon. Capture of the English and Dutch Turkey fleet by the French, 1693, was a further incentive to increase the Persian trade of the Company and to try to divert the course of the silk trade from its old route, by concentrating it at Ispahan and thence conveying the silks by way of Gombroon. The price of cloth sent to Persia to be increased 50 per cent. Death of the King of Persia; necessity to apply for phir- mauds to his successor Sultan Hussein [for in Persia small grants like commercial privileges cease with the King's death]. The Agency propose to ask the Shah to exempt them from paying large presents to the Khans and Shah-bandar. Two years' tribute due to the Khan of Carmania who had inter dicted purchase of wool beyond 700 maunds a year. Gom broon customs paid only up to 1791—92. Formidable power of the Arabs qfMaskat. This fleet consists of 5 large ships manned by 1,500 men. The Arabs plunder Cong, capture an Armenian ship and threaten Gombroon, and the Sbah-bandar asks that the English ship Nassan should be detained for 20 days to assist in the defence of the port, which request is complied with. The Armenians refuse to comply with the English demands for larger quantities of silk in exchange for English goods, on the ground that the traffis by the Turkey route had not decreased. The Sub-Agent at Ispahan represents the character of some of the Armenian broker in bad light and the Agent proceeds to Ispahan. Page 183 The Couit, to the Agent and Council in Persia, 15th Janu ary 1695—96. Half of the goods shipped for Gombroon should be forwarded for sale with all despatch to Ispahan ; List of goods expected in England, Carmenia wool, Ispahan Chintzes of the finest and varied kinds, of at least 20 pieces of each sort, to the amount of £20,000. Reason for this exertion—the quick sale of these goods. The freight of the first ships of the season had risen to £34 per ton, and of the latter ships to £40 per ton,SUMMARY. xxxi Name of the book or Volume of the Beoords. Nature of documsafo or papers.

List of JRogoms renewed and granted to the English by Shah Sulta?i Ruttein, dated 18th June 1697. Apprehensions entertained of a war in the Gulf between the Arabs and Persuus, in which the Dutch expected to assist the Persians with a view to s^iin monopoly of the Persian trade ; bat the English General Sir John Gayer (Commander of the English fleet in the East ladiesl did not see the etpediency of interfering as the Arabs had not hitherto offered any obstruction to the Eusjlish shipping or trade. The Armeniaus prove false to the Compaav, as they supported also the trade by way of Turkey, purchasin? for instance the English produce imported by way of Aleppo. The Dutch obtain the privilege to import into Ispahan duty frej goods to the a nount of 20,000 tomans while the East India Com pany, only up to 5,000 tomans. Customs at Gombroon not recovered for three years. The navigation in the Gulf had become more difficult from the growing power of tbe Maskat Arabs still acting against the Persian trade. Captain Brang- win who had succeeded Agent Gladman (dated 14th Novem ber 1695) wrote that c&lt; they would prove as great a plague in India, as the Algerines were in Europe.' War between the Maskat Arabs and the Persians. The Maskat Arabs having found that the Portuguese had offered assist ance to Persia, fitted oat expeditions against their settle ments in Mozambique and at Mangalore and burnt them. The East India Company overawed by this think it the best policy to keep aloof, especially as they had not sufficient shipping with which to assist the Persians, and therefore gave evasive replies to Persian requests for assistance. Death of Agent Brangwin in September, Mr. Owen appointed to succeed him. Two additional Factors sent to Mushat and Tauris. Application to the Ettaman Dawlat for payment of 1,000 tomans of the customs (Gombroon) annually and for exemption from payment of the duty called ' Sudeah.' Hopes held out that the application woald he granted. Though sales of cloth proceeded slowly owing to market being glutted by cloth imported by way of Aleppo, the sales at Ispahan and Gambroon produced 30,000 sequins. The Court of Directors being under an obligation to export a large quantity of cloth from England, approved of the endeavour to dispose of it at Tauris, Mushat and other inland towns, and resolved to make Ispahan their chief settlement in Persia and that G-omhroon should be subordinate to it. As large quantities as possible of cloth to be sent to Ispahan, Gombroon and Shiraz, with a view to undersell cloth brought from Aleppo, by keeping prices lower than those fixed by the Turkey Company. The ' Ahtnama ' or phirmaund, granted by Sultan Hussein, dated the 18th June 1697, conferred particular priviledges on the English nation, and proceeded on the phirmaund ori ginally granted by Shah Abbas the Great, in 1615 (? 1617), during the reign of King James I, which was afterwards renewed by Shah Sephi, and, subsequently, hy 8hah Selimon,(?) in the reign of King Charles II. This new phirmaund stipu lated, that an English Ambassador, or Consul, should reside in Persia, and, if required, a Persian Ambassador should pro ceed to England, that the English might bring their ships to whatever ports in Persia they pleased, and he furnished with carriages for their goods, and pay the same price for provi sions, as the natives ; that, in case of shipwreck, they should be assisted in saving their goods, and persons embezzling them were to make restitution; that they should not be obliged to sell their goods at any particular port, but might purchase what they chose, with ready money; that they should not be compelled to abjure their own religion, 'it being G-od's business to turn men's hearts that they should be entitled to wear arms, to defend themselves against ' rogues' attempting to steal their goods, and not Joe punishable for killing them; but if the offender (being a Persian) be seized, he was to be carried before the chief officer of the place, who was to punish him ; but if English, ' they might kill him themselves that the English Ambassador should be allowed a house, and if any of his people offended, he should be the Judge ; and the English Consul, in absence of the Ambassador, was to have the same respect and privileges; that if the Persians should commit any injury on the attendants of the Ambassador, application was to be made to the Cazi for redress; that the linguists of the Ambassador should be privileged ; that the English should be allowed to employ people of everv cost, who might be willing to serve them, and if an English slave be brought from Turkey, he should be liberated, on the repayment to his master, of the sum paid for him ; that, on the death of an Englishman, his countrymen might dispose of his effects, according to their own Christian law ; and if he should have married a Christian, and have children, and the mother be dead.xxx ii SL'M-siARY.

The Eogoms, or particular privileges, granted to the Company, included the nineteen, formerly conferred by the successive sovereigns of Persia, with two additional ones. By the former grants, the Company had a right to possess a house at Ispahan; to recover goods taken from them on the road ; to be exempted from ' Roddarage' in the Persian dominions ; to receive civil usage ; to export twelve horses annually ; to export two thousand maunds of goods, free of duty ; to convey their goods in safety to their house in Ispahan ; to have a right of bringing water to their house; to have guards to their Caphilos, or caravans; to make, drink, and export wine; to employ assistants in making wine; to levy what Caramania wool they might have occasion for ; to have the power of judging of the offences of their own people; to sell to the Governor of Gombroon for ready money, he being prohibited from employing any force in compelling such sales ; to take possession of their own house at Shiraz, which the Governor had dispossessed them of { not to be compelled to give presents to the Khans, or Governors; to be protected against hindrance in bringing goods on shore, at Gombroon ; and no custom, in future, to be paid on ' Biing ' and sugar. The additional Rogoms now granted by Sultan Hussein, were, first, that the English should, in future, be exempted from payment of the duties of ' iSudeak ' and ' Havoy, ' through out the Persian dominions ; and, secondly, that the arrears of the customs, due to the English, should be immediatly adjusted, and paid by the Governor of Gombroom, Order of the King to the Khan of Carmania to permit the Company's purchases of wool to be made to the full extent. No rogoms could, however, be obtained for exporting silk by way of Gombroon, as this request was opposed by Armenians, whose trade by way of Aleppo with the Turkey Company would thereby suffer. The Charles the Second arrives at Gombroon with large quantities of cloth, which were sold to shopkeepers at 18 months' credit, notwithstanding Armenian opposition. Proposed re-employment of ' Daud ' the Company's former broker. The Charles Second is offered to convey the Persian Ambassador to India, the English being anxious to have the credit of this service rather than the Dutch.

The Agent submits a petition to tha Ettaman Dowlat praying for payment of the arrears of customs, exemption irom certain dues, permission to export siquins and silver and an order to the Shah-bandar at Gombroon, prohibiting him frona molesting the English. The Dutch try their utmost with bribes to officers to get the King visit their factory, but fail on 2nd September 1699 ; the English Agent is presented by the Shah with a Khelat (vest of honor), a rich sword and a horse. The Shah-bandar of Gombroon paid 1,000 to mans of arrears of customs and promised to pay 2,000 tomans more of the arrears on the ensuing March. On account of the favour granted by the Shah, the Com pany send him presents (optical glasses, sword blades, etc.). Though satisfied with privileges obtained the Court regretted that no petition had been presented for the right of exporting raw silk. Mr. Oliver {appointed Agent) and Mr. Bruce, hia second, ordered to present a petition for this privilege which had become all the more important from the prohibi tion of import of Indian wrought goods and the necessity of having a large supply of raw silk to accommodate the manufacturers in England. Rogom obtained from the King for payment of arrears of Gombroon Customs (982 tomans), which was obtained on payment of 50 tomans to the Shah-bandar. Agent Owen goes to Ispahan to settle a claim about rank between Agent Bruce and the Armenians and brokers. Agent Owen sug gests that if force be used on the Gulf, the island of Barrein should be oocupied, a station which would not only afford a proportion of Persian produce, but enable the Company to overawe the trade. The Persian trade was on the whole good; appearance of a Ship the {Montague) belonging to the English Company (to be distinguishad from the London Company, the old East India Company). When its Captain was informed that an Act of Parliament had been passed for continuing the London East India Company he behaved correctly and made purchases with mercantile propriety (conduct rare in the English Company's officers). At the commencement of the season, when the prospects of the Union between the two Companies were uncertain, the Court allowed discretionary powers to their agents in Persia in regard to the English Company's ships, should they interfere in the Persian trade, but the London Com pany's agents were to explain to the Persian Government that the London Company would continue to enjoy exclu sively the rights on which the English Company were not to participate. After however the plan of Union was adopted, the London Company's Agents were instructed to observe the most friendly intercourse with the English Company's Agents on the completion of the Union. The Court of Directors of the London Company informed the Agents and Councils - in Persia, as well as their General, President (Sir John Gayer, Mr. Colt) and Council at Bombay, that they were to hold their appointments and allowances till next year's investments, after which the utmost exertion would be used to continue them. Sir Nicholas White (Chief of the English Company at Surat) sent agents to Basrah and received information that trade was practicable at that port on the Company's agreeing to pay customs at the rate of 8 per cent, ad valorem. Sir John Gayer (appointed Governor 'of Bombay) instructed to send a confidential agent to Persia to investigate into the disputes that had subsisted between the Company's agents and factors in Persia, and also to wind up the separate accocuts of the London Company and report.xxxir Summary.

Orders of the Bombay Govern ment, 6th April 1724. The Court of the London Company explained to Sir John Gaver that the existing war in Europe, alone, prevented their obtaining men-of-war to clear the Indian seas of the pirates or sending a supply of soldiers for the garrison of Bombay, but they would employ every effort, when peace should be restored not only to render that garrison respect able, but to equip armed ships to clear the seas and to root out that nest of pirates, the Muscat Arabs. The tight to customs at Gombroon 1,000 tomans transferred to the United Company by the Act of Union. Mr. Prescott appointed Chief at Ispahan, Mr. Owen next on Council and Chief at Gombroon. Mr. Prescott to carry Queen's letter to the Shah with presents from the United Company to get trade settled on old basis and arrears of customs. Sir Nicholas White (President at Surat, representing the English Company), reports that on hearing Mr. Owen's death, he had appointed Mr. Lock to he Chief at Ispahan. Mr. Lees to be Second, and Mr. Crowe, Agent at Gombroon. Mr. Prescott deputed with the Queen's letter and the presents to the Shah and dies on the way at Asseen. Arrears of Gombroon Customs 981 tomans. The oppressions of the English by the Moguls at Surat had lowered the English prestige. The capture of Ormuz by the English on which the right to the moiety whs mainly based, was forgotton, because the naval force with which the English had protected the Persian pilg&gt; iwis going to Mecca had been withdrawn and the ships conveying them had been taken by the Arab pirates.

A^ent Look obtains a rogom for J.,000 tomans of Gombroon Customs and arrears 5,981 tomans of which the proportion of the London Company was 2,306 tomans. The agency received 2,219 tomans worth of silk in part payment. Trade promising. Arab and Mahratta Pirates make many depredations. King of Persia propose? to send a merchant to Bombay, and a nobleman as Ambassador to Hatavia for obtaining assistance against the pirates. The British not in a position to render adequate assistance by themselves, but anxious to prevent the Dutch from making themselves prominent. Promise was ttiven that as soon as war in Europe should cease, a sufficient naval force would be sent to destroy the pirates. Arrears of customs due to the London Company up to the date of the Union (22nd July 1702) recovered as also other separate debts. TENTH PERIOD, 1708-1718.

Persia overrun by enemies and trade in 1726-—30 at very low ebb. Sheikh Rasliid establishes a port at Bassidore in opposition to Gombroon. As this affected the customs receipts at Gombroon, the Agency fitted outan expedition in April 1727 under the command of Draper consisting of the Brittania frigate, the Bengal galley aud two trankeys and recovered from Sheikh Rashad the share of customs due to the East India Company. Differences between the Dutch and Afghans at Gombroon in 1728.- Ormuz captured by the Dutch but surrendered and amicable arrnngement arrived at through the good offices of the English Agency.

The French ship at Gombroon received invitation from Thomas Caun for the French to re-settle at Gombroon. Pressure brought to bear upon the Agency to furnish shipping against the Turks and restrictions placed on the Company's trade. As there is a prospect of conclusion of place between Persia and Turkey, there is likelihood the Company's affairs will improve, no likelihood of having to recall Mr. French from Basrah or sending ships there against the Turks. Thomas Caun's intrigues to establish himself as King, in which case the Company's prospects gloomy. ELEVENTH PEEIOD, 1737-1747. . SHAH'S BEIGN. NADIR Visit of Mr. French (Resident at Basrah) to Bagdad to obtain redress of grievances against Mussalim of Basrah. Thomas Caun accepts crown under title of Shah Nadir, renews East Indian Company's privileges, but expects the Company to furnish ships for his fleet, which it is determined to increase. Mirza Togghy Khan's son and brother invited themselves to the Agency garden at Asseen and had to be entertained at great expense and sent away with large presents. Merchants having been severely treated by Gov ernment had left the town, but were prevailed upon to return. State of the trade in Carmania and Nadav Shah favourable to the English. He expects them however to assist against Maskat. Present of a ship to him. Mr. French recouped his charges for doctor and for paying the Bashaw for reducing customs. Great dearth of silver money in Karmania and difficulty of making sales. Reported establishment of a Russian factory at Astrakan and import of woollen goods from there. Shah Nadir assures the English of his protection and his gratification at getting a ship from them, but expected them to assist his fleet against the Muscateers. A French ship arrived from Bengal, and two Dutch ships from Batavia. The Persian fleet under Latifa Khan with 5,000 men and 1,500 horses sailed on Ist April for Corju* khoon lying about halfway between Maskat and Gombroon. The alleged object of the expedition was to assist Imam of Maskat against his rebellious subjects, though, if it be found practicable, the Persians would not hesitate to seize the Imaum and subject Maskat to Persia. The English were not pressed for assistance, but the Dutch were so pressed that they sent one ship, Beglerbegy arrived at Gombroon on 13th February, having given many fair promises that nobody should be molested, which he broke soon, though propitiated with rich presents. He renewed the Rogums to the English, excerpt as to 1,000 towards out of the customs. He agreed, however, to give one-third of the customs on the freight brought by our own ships. This privilege cost the Agency the sum of 150 tomans in the shape of a present and other expenses to entertain him. He extorted money from the Agency for preventing him to stop the East Indian Company carrying copper and blask money and other things besides wool from Carmania. The Arabs in the Persian Marine Service had revolted and carried some of the ships, at which the Dutch were prevailed t 0 ,. at , tack tIie re bpls with two of their ships, but they eiiected little. The English were then appealed to, as being bound by agreement to assist the Persians in the Gulf. The Persians were greatly agitated at one of English ships having taken pass from Imaum of Maskat, and at the Commander of a British vessel having sold it to the Imaum. There was a great demand for English woollens notwithstanding the confusion in Persia.summakt. XXXVU Public Department Diary No, 17, page 89. Public Department Diary No. 17, page 142.

Agent had reconnoitered all the ports on the an ^ considered Bushire the best—because (1) it was full of inland merchants and there was much freedom. There would be a good sale of woollens and tin, (2) there it was not necessary to gratify anybody but the Sheikh, (3) three parts of the town were surrounded by water and the factory could be easily defended against attacks.

Utmost endeavours would be made to recover Nasir Khan's debt. Hadji Ali had been removed from Governorship of Gombroon and Jaffer Khan returned. The latter sent against Julfar Arabs, assembled at Loft. Great disappointment felt at Jaffer Khan's return by all classes, as Hadji Ali was a good ruler and many people had settled at Qombrocu, especially the Beni Main Ar^bs. The Gombroon Agency to be witJidraucn and only a linguist to be left there to keep up the British flag. Trade was stagnant in Carmania.

He was believed to be privy to the oppressions of Jaffer Khan, his brother. Pressing the East Indian Company to establish a factory at Bushire. Affairs continued to be in much the same situation at Gombroon. Jaffer Khan rectilled from Gombroon by his brother, Nasir Khan, and replaced by his father-in-law, an avaricious man.

Operations against tbe Eaab. Ttie Pasha promises 1,000 tomans a month to meet the charge of the Company's fleet, and orders pajment of Haji Yusuf's debts. Promising strict compliance with the orders* of the Court of Directors. It would have been well bad his predecessors observed the above rule and not attempted to get Sheikh Nasir removed.

Summary. Orders from the Presidency for deputing an agent (Mr. Skipp preferably) to Shiraz to conclude an agreement with Karim Khan for obtaining redress for the losses inflicted on the Company by the Kaab and for obtaining certain con cessions. Giving an interesting history of the Kaab tribe, their wars with the Persian and the Turks. The part played by the East India Company in these wars. The Turks now afraid to wage war against the Kaab, without the permission of Karim Khan, who questions their authority to carry on warlike operations in what he claims to be Persian territory. Instructions to Mr. Skipp, on his mission to Earim Khan. Points to be insisted upon, in addition to those specified by the Bombay Government (1) Karim Khan should co operate with the English to reduce tHe Kaab, (2) the Kaab Gallivats should be handed over to the English. Karim Khan would insist on the English assisting him against Meer Mohana. Detention of vessels. Mission of Persian ambassador Agasy Khan to the Kaab. Its failure. Karim Khan had demanded 4,000 tomans annually from the Sheikhs of Hushire and Barreem, and had countenauced ' Jankseer Government' to take np arms against the Sheikh of Bushire. Con goon captured by Zackey Caun (or Tackey Caun, brother of Karim Khan). An order received that every merchant with his family should leave Bushire and prohibit ing all trading there or exporting specie in future, which caused great stagnation of tr^ide. The Resident had written to Mr. Skipp at Shiraz to apply to the Karim Khan to get the orders revoked. The Residency had received orders from the Agent and Council that they should on the arrival of Mr. Skipp from Sheraz ship the Company's property and seize the ships of Karim Khan and the Sheikhs ot Barreem and Bushire, upon which they should repair Basrah. Expressing regret at the precarious and unsettled affairs in the Persian Gulf, and the great probability of the Company being involved in war with Karim Khan, in case the orders, which could not be anticipated, of the Agent and Council were carried out. Karim Khan accedes to most of the English demands, no objection to any operations against the Kaab in which he, however, will not himself nor allow the Turks to co-operate. Meer Mohana fleeces the coffee fleet. Operations again,t the Sheikh of Ormuz decided upon grounds for this step stated. The disastrous end of the expedition against Ormuz.

Letter from the Committee ap pointed to report on the advantages or otherwise of removing the agency from Basrah to Bushire, dated 3id November 1769. Meer Hussein Sultan, Sheikh of Karrak, seemed to be wavering between his fear of Karim Khan and his desire to keep pos- sessicn of the island : various reports about his intentions (1) to deliver the island to Karim Khan, (2) to ask the English to establish a factory there, (3) to request the Imam of Mnskat for aid. Karim Khan reported to have asked the Kaab Sheikh to send his fleet to join Persian fleet against the Meer, or even against the English fleet should any attempt be made against carrying the riches from Karrak. It was unnecessary and inadvisable to keep the English fleet any longer near Karrak. The Agent and Council therefore ordered the main portion of the squadron down the Gulf— unless there was an opportunity to destroy the fleets of the Meer, the Chaub and the Khan. Meer Mohana was murdered by order of the Pasha. Orders passed on letters from Agent and Council, Basrah, dated '^Oth December 1767, 8th March and 21st April 1768. Disapproving of the Agency proceedings, their omission and their failure to keep the fleet waiting for the troops of Karim Khan or to place at their disposal the remaining ships for being transported to Karrak. It was cleur that Karim Khan was disposed to offer favourable terms to the Company, notwithstanding which the Agent ordered Mr. Skipp to leave Shiraz, a step which was disastrous in the Company's interests in the Gulf. The President and Council were of opinion that the disagreeable situation arose from the Agent Mr Moore's antipathy to Karim Khan, and his pique against Mr. Skipp. The proceedings of the Agent and Council were most extra ordinary and unwarrantable. They ought not to have attempted to stop communication between Karrak and the mainland or set on foot negotiation with the islanders. They ought to have approached Zackey Khan, who had he gained quick possession of the island would have compensated the Company for its losses. The Agent and Council should now obtain the best tern s possible from Khan preferly, if not from the isiauders. Skipp re-instated on certain conditions. It would probably in the iuterests of the Company to establish the Agency at Bushire and only a Residency at Basrah. A Committee consisting of Messrs Wrench, Jervis and Martyn is appointed to report on the advantages and disadvantages of the two piaces. Karim Khan had sent an expedition against Maskat, as the Imam had relufed to comply with certain demands. The Agency try to keep aloof because (1) of the orders of the Presidency not to commence hostilities against Karim Khan, (2) to do so would impede the plan of drawing trade to Basrah. The Agency was however anxious for the safe arrival of the Maskat coffee fleet because (a) some benefit would accrue from customs on the coffee to the Company, (6) they would oblige the Basrah merchants, (c) they were friends of' Maskateers. The question was whether the Company's ships could act as convoy to the Maskat fleet. Turkish expedition against the Montefiks. The Kaab joins the Turks. The Arab tribes that join the Turks and Montiflks respectively. Reporting in favour of an agency at Bushire, because there would a larger sale of woolens in exchange for Ghilan silk, which Kaiim Khan {iot in lieu of revenue on account of scarcity of specie in Persia, and few of the Persian Merchants would go to Basrah for the woollens with all the disadvantages the Persians would have to suffer in repahiBg to Basrah, viz., (a) religious bitterness of feeling of the Turks against the Persians, (6) charges of freight, export and import duties and tolls, etc., (c) insecurity of life on account of Arab depre dations. The Persians could get woollens from the Russians at less trouble and expense, and they would prefer to pay 20 per cent, more at Bushire than at Basrah on account of troubles they would have to undergo by going to Basrah. A fortified factory at Bushire would be as powerful against attack as one at Basrah.lii SUMMARY. Name of the book or Volume ol the Becorda. Nature of documents or papers. Suwmary.

PLAGUE AT HASRAH. BASRAH TAKEN BY TH^ PERSIANS. RE-ESTAB LISHMENT OF FACTORY AT BUSHIRE. BUSHIRE RESIDENCY SEPARATED FROM THAT OP BASRAH. It appeared to the Governor and Council that the establish ment of a factory in Persia would be necessary in the interests of the Company. No direct request should be made by the agency to Karim Khan, but they could secure an invitation from him through Sheikh Nasir, who had recently written pressing the English to resettle at Bushire. Mr. James Morley recently appointed as an assistant should in that case be sent to Karim Khan to negotiate the terms. In the opinion of the Governor and^ Council the loss the Company suffered by the recent expedition against Karrak was due mainly to the agency having precipitedly returned the fleet to Bombay without waiting for Kadm Khan's forces. Karim had be haved in a friendly manner towards the English in several instances. The Court entirely disapprove of any measurs towards re establishing the factory at Bushire or elsewhere in Persia for these reasons : (1) it would be open to dangers as recent- ly, (2) the pale at Basrah would decrease as from the Committee's report it appeared that one-third of the woollens sold at Basrah found their way to Persia, while there was not a very good prospect of large sales at Bushire, and (3) there would not an increase in prices at Bushire in proportion to the expenses attending a settlement theie, (4) a fortified settlement was a most extravagant notion. The agency had been under the necessity of deferring any measure for entering in to negotiation w : th Karim Khan as ordered by the Presidency for want of suitable presents which it was necessary to send him in the first instance. For the same reasons the application recommended to be made to Sheikh Nasir had been put off. The Eagle and Dolphin w^re sufficient in the present situation of the Gulf. The expedition was therefore sent to the Presi dency, but i's ear'y return was required to relieve the Eagle. A guardship was necessary at Basrah. Karim was engRged in makinsr large warlike preparations probably against Ahmedshah, King of the Afghans. Capture of an English vessel [Brittanica), a Gosro ketch under English colours and a Maskat vessel by Hussein Khan, Admiral of the Persian fleet. Proposal to despatch a squadron to the Gulf and have recourse to arras against Karim Khan. Proposed deputation to the Kaab for obtaining restitution for English losses. Condemning the proposal for an expedition to the Gulf to obtain redress by force of arms, and incurring an expenditure which cannot be justified. Break ont of plague at Basrah. Basrah for Bombay.

Expedition getting ready at Bushire supposed by some to be intended against Maskat and by others against Basrah. Soleman Agha appointed Mussalim in the room of Essuf Agha. Sheikh Mohomed, Governor of Gomhroon, being at Shiraz, his son offers the Dutch factory to the English. The Maskat fleet burns two Persian gallivats at Gambroon. The position of the fleets—Messrs. Beaumont and Green at Bushire. Sheikh invites the Agent to the shore at Bushire. Mr. Abraham lands and is received with great politeness—Aga Kutohook, a merchant of Persia and Sheikh Nasir's Attorney, makes certain purchases. Reporting his return to Basrah—Calling the attention of the Pasha to the wretched condition of the merchants—Proposal to send a caravan from Basrah to Aleppo direct—2 vessels brought from Bombay for the Pasha. Pasha asks the Agent to man and manage the ships. The caravan is to go from Baghdad not from Basrah—asks the Agent's aid to bring thecofee fleets to Basrah from Maskat. The Pasha presumably refers to Karim KVan's request for the English and Turkish ships to assist him against Maskat Arabs, on default of which he threatned to attack Basrah— Mr. Moore advises the Pasha to send troops and order the Arabs for the defence of Basrah against the tbreatned Persian attack. In view of the probable Persian attack on Basrah. Agency going to leave the place. Designs of Karim Khan against Basrah —Differences between the Turks and the Kaab—Hyder Ali's embassy to Karim Khan for obtaining a settlement on the Gulf. Beaumont and Green on their way to Bushire. War against Imam at Maskat—Zakey Khan (brother of the Vakil) decoyed by Sheikh Abdullah of Ormuz and coniined as a prisoner. Terms of treaty with Persia proposed by Imam of Maskat. Mr. Green sent to Basrah to negotiate terms of agreement between the Company and Karim Khan, which the Agency would not accept. Orders as regards the affairs of the Gulf. Serious incon venience had been caused at the Presidency by the detention of the Eagle and Success at Basrah. The heavy expense involved in this was owing to the differences with Karim Khan, which had their origin in the antipathy of Mr. Moore (agent at Basrah) to the Khan. This disagreeable situation must now cease, and the agency must take every measure to come to understanding with Karim Khan. It was neces sary to obtain the release of Messrs. Beaumont and Green — but ' as from the their representation we have reason to conclude that the enlargement of Mr. Beaumont, cannot be obtained without re-establisliing a settlement at Bushire and as humanity dictates that we should devise some means to effect his release, we have therefore to acquiesce in the measure, notwithstanding it is prohibited by our Son'ble employers, provided a peace with the Caun and the enlarge ment of Mr. Beaumont, can be obtained on no other terms ; for as we observed above, the interest of the Company will not admit any longer of their crnizers being stationed in the Gulf.' Mr. Garden (member of the Council) proceeding to the Gulf on his private aflairs is authorised to treat with Persian authorities with a view to obtain release of Mr. Beau mont and make peace with the Persians, and if to obtain these purposes he has to agree to re-open the factory at Bushire, this agreement should be respected and carried out. The property of the Company to be sent to Busbire should be limited. Mr. Beaumont to have the option of being Resident at Bushirer—failing whom Mr. Green appointed to the place.liv SUMMARY.

Karim Khan had ordered a report to be sent to him of the sta'e of the Arabian coast from Grain to Maskat. The people of Grain alarmed and leaving the place. The Imam of Maskat reported to have in view to send a deputation to Karim Khan for accommodating matters and agreeing to pay him a tribute, being very anxious not to loss the trade of Basrah, on which Maskat depended much. The sale of woollens very limited at Bnshire, though with the commencement of the trading season in September, there was a prospect of large sales. The gulivats of Sheikh Abdullah of Ormuz had captured a dow belonging to his people, but richly laden with goods from Maskat, and they chased two trankeys up to Congoom. They had orders from the vakil to seize all Maskat property and cut off all communication between Maskat and the Gulf. Sheikh Nasir was too much of a merchant himself, purchasing one-third of the Company's goods at Bushire to assist them in maintaining high prices. Sadu Khan encroaches on the Company's privileges.SUMMARY. IV Name of the book or Volume of the Becoids. Basrah Diary No. 20 3 1775-77. Tactory Jiof Basrah Factory Diary No. ^ of 1775-77.

They entered town when It was carelessly guarded and occupied it after little opposition on 30th of June. They set fire to several houses. Sheikh Saddun (Sheikh Nasir's brother) tamely submitted. The next day, Bagar Khan marched into the town and during 11 days sacked the place of its effects of the value of 3 or 4 laos of rupees.

They were further joined by Sheiks of Genowa and Bunderik, and the people of Dhasistan add the allies besieged Bagar Khan in his fort. Reduced at last to extremeties, he threw himself at the feet of Sheikh Nasir, but was murdered by the people of Genowa, who had a blood feud with him. XM SUMMARY.

Wee met not with any accidents in our passage hither that is worth your notice, nor did wee touch att all at the Cape, having before most happilie fallen upon the Island of Trinidada lying in the latitude of 20 and 40 ms., where wee had both safe rydinge and very plentiful refreshment, both of fish and fowl in great abundance, and where I should wish all our outward-bound fleets might endeavour futurely to stay, at a place more safe than the Cape, and more easie to get off without the least tardiness or difficultie, the water being excellent good, though a little troublesome in its conveyance into our boats. The further description whereof, as of the island itself, together with the reasons of our not fullie wateringe therefore that tyme, I referr unto the Commander's relason hear (sic) with all, and proceed to other advice following. Att this island wee arrived the 20th day of May, and sett sayle againe the 25th ditto; and having doubled the Cape without touching there as aforesaid, I saw fair likelihood on a great proportion of tyme to be advansfc unto us serving to no other use in your benefit than fruitlesslye to be cast away on eating and drinking att all the islands, and therefore fell into con sideration how to make use of their advantage unto your behoust; and that in communicating my mynde witu the Commander in private, and afterwards to the rest in publique, how greatly it would redowne to the convenience, strength, and benefit of your trade and state and fleet that possibly Persia might be reasonably attained before our arrival at Surrat; but so as the adventures of your business in the one might no way prejudice the other.

That in respect of your commission, in ordering the next years's silk, to be down at port in that year's 1st August at the furthest, it would be a great forwarding thereunto by the advance this way of four or five months' time for the furtherance of that mayne design, which otherwise, in my opinion, may runne some hazard of prolongation; that I myself shall have a faire opportunity of conference with the factors there, whereby to be informed of many parti culars which by letters at so far a distance as India from thence they will either neglect or peradverture not dare at all to advise; and lastly the advan tage of forestalling of the Duttch in our markets, chiefly in the choyse and accomodating of ourselves with the fittingest assortments of silk, and so leave the refuse upon the Duttch, which I consider to be a point of weighty consideration. On these foundations we have built our resolution (at the least to endeavour our purpose) for Persia, and shall hasten the prosecution thereof with all possible diligence, than what the winds and faire success in our voyage shall administer, for in case of anything occurring in the passage to crosse, we shall then disturb this inttention, and apply ourselves for Surratt first as other fleets hereto.

The pepper is all landed and agrees with the Invoice in amount of bags, but not a merchant yet will proffer more than 3 rupees, Bussora maund which if we would make sale of it all at that price, it should go, but they who proffer it will not have more than 2 or 3 maunds at most, so that perforce we must keep it; we hope for a better time; In case we should have broke the price at 3 rupees then we must be forced to sell the remainder at a lower rate to prevent which, we determined to make sale of it after the ship s departure.

Reed. ye. 29th Deer, 1656. VIII. Augustin Swallow (Gombroon) to the Chief and Council at Surat. Worthy Good Friends, It is my grief that this my Letter should be the Messenger of such bad Details of newes as of pe. death of Mr. Tho : Reynardson, who departed ys. transitory world Keynardsons deatir ye. 20th Novr. 1656 at halfe an hour past one in the afternoon having laiden enoed^n^Hn^ sick 12 dayes of a feavor, being troubled first with an excessive vomiting for aSd making one day and a halfe. Ye. Lord fitt us for our last end, in the time of his their i nventar y' sickness August in Swallow severall times desired him to make his will when slightingly answered that he did not intend to die, likewise I demanded of him how ye. Company's business lay that during his sickness I might look after it, and indeed urged him the more thereto that in case it should please ye. L®rd14 to take him to himselfe I might know wt. to demand of ye. breaker in ye. Hon'ble Company's name; but he was not pleased to acquaint me therewith. Yet howsoever so soone as I perceived Mr. Heynardson to be dead, I thought it my dutie to take care yt. nothing of his or ye. Company's should be stolen, therefore demanded all ye. kees yt. were in Gordeys possession, ye. which were delivered over. The 21st Instant I performed his funerall rites, ye. Dutche &amp; myself accompaning him to ye. ground in a decent manner after my returne to ye. Company's house I call for Tockerse ye. Company's Breaker and in ye. presence of Mr. Rayman demanded of him ye. Company's Accounts and Mr. Reynardson's (for he enordered him to keep ym. apart) but he very permantorie denied to give me any. With all asked who I was that I should require them or him and so in a railing manner slighted mee asking me how I durst take ye. dead man's kees in my custodye before he had put his Chopp on them. I presume this his haughty carriage was because he could have no opportunity to make any thing away, this his pride I did beare with untill Mr. William Milward arrived and so acquainted him therewith ye. 25th of this month he being that morning come to the Bunder, wt. Tockersee's intent was not to deliver me ye. Accounts as they stood in his book at yt. time I cannot judge, but to be dishonest, for who can disprove what he shall put to Mr. Reynardson's account, for he by ys. action has had time enough to frame new accounts as it is Banian fashion so to doe after ye. death of any one, whereas had bee rendered mee ye. accounts when demanded he could not have hud opporrtunity to have played to knave. Since Mr. Milward's arrivall voice of Mr. Renardson's things hath been taken and likewise his account intended to be taken from Tockerse wch. when all is accomplished Augustine Swallow doth proposed to voyage wth. all his things on ye. first shipp of the Companys yt. shall come to this porte; and at his arrivall God sending himselfe to Surafct thereto deliver all to ye. Wopll. etc. Councell seing he dyed intested. The 16th Instant here arrived a Dutche shipp whose burden is 60 Tonn it is reported yt. she from Cape Bonspeva with Letters to Generall of Battavia, being sent only to yt. port, but meeting with cross winds and stormes att sea and wanting provisions was forced to come to Gombroone to trim her &amp; take in what she wanted, the dutche sayes that yr. was no letter to any of them, therefore newes they had none. This at present is all yt. is worthy of yo. notice therefore wth. tender of my humble service I take leave, &amp; remain. Yours Most Observant Servant at Command, (8d.) AUGUSTIN SWALLOW.

Commission and instructions given b unto our loving friend Captain now oy God s permission bound from thence to the Porte of ApriTllwmT' ^ Cmnnier and Robert You being now laden with most part of the Hon'ble Company's goods and fctothill to Basrah, completed with freight, we desire you on sight hereof, wind and tide permitting to weigh anchor and set sail directing your course for Gombroon, there to deliver our letter to our friends there resident, which we hope may be done in one or two days at the most, which done, make what haste possible to obtain the Port of Bussorah, where arriving you are to set on shore, Mr. George SubeVt, r EObert 1 S f thm deCently ' affordin S u P on all occasions that the Hon ble Company's business requires it, the use of the boats well manned17 and to observe their order in the unlading of your vessel, and lading any freight ^oods, &amp;o., from thence upon her. As also in their passage thither the use of the great Cabin wholly, and to receive your dispatch from them, which we enorder to be by the 20th September without fail. Mr. Sainthill return ing with you in the vessel, in your way touching at Gombroon, there to take in 30 or 40 Tomans of red earth for the homeward bound voyage. XII. t Commission and instructions given hy us the President in Council of India, Persia, etc., unto our loring friends Mr. George Cranmer and Mr. Robert Sainthill to be observed by them on thexr voyage to Bussora and return to Swally Bole. Bated on Swally Marine, the 13th April 1661, The Surat Frigate arriving so late from her intended voyage to Cale * * * * The Surat Frigate though she obtained not her Port, yet with a great deal ot trouble, and charge wiftL'rl^owb. brought up hither the cloth made there for the market of Ensland, but in »»^ 3 ' conducting sales at opening and overlooking found it not so fit for England, being a slight made Basrah, cloth, therefore have laden that, and Pepper, Cassia Lignum, Rice, etc., to make up a considerable cargo, and have appointed you Mr. George Oranmer Chief, and Mr. Robert Sainthill to keep the account of the voyage, now intended upon Frigate Amerita to Bussorab, there when arrived to unlade first the freight goods now shipped, and in that time to salute the Bashaw from us, delivering our letters, acquainting him with our expectation of his making good his last year's promise of furnishing you with a better house than that taken from the Hon'ble Company, but if you should not obtain our desire you must hire a convenient house for the loding of merchandize. But take care not to land more of the prementioned goods than you can sell to advantage because of the paying of customs, and if the Bazar of Bussorah affords not a price considerable that is profitable, then keep them on board ship, returning them upon the ship to us, and when you dispeed the Amerita from you, which we desire you to keep no longer than the 20th September at farthest, let Mr. Sainthill come upon her giving him order that at his arrival at Gombroon he proffer to sale the said cloth also, at your now going if opportunity presents of a word to profit let not slip the opportunity which you may make trial of by carrying on shore musters at your arrival, for we desire you not to stay longer in the road of Gombroon outward bound, than two days at most, in this business we would have you careful, because if the cloth cannot be sold to profit we intend it at last home, the rest of the goods being wholly for Ithe Bussorah Bazar we make no doubc of their sale and therefore consign them to you for the best disposal. There is dispeded you two packets ror our Hon'ble Employers, the first of which send away as soon as arrived, the other send days 10 after, with a letter to the Consul to hasten them forward. Mr. Cranmer we have enordered to take his passage unto us upon the ' Ormus merchant 5 which may stay some time after the 4 Amerita,' and suppose he may have occasion so to do by reason of the slow coming in of money and we positively enorder that none may be left behind nor bad debts made. Copy of the commander's commission is included you, therefore needless to rehearse any thing concerning it, but only to require your assisting him in what he is commanded, if opportunity fact of matter of presents. We have here paid ********* Pradre Barnaby's bill of exchange but desire him hereafter to forbear that practice, for if any charge of letters t See 2nd foot-note to No. XVI. 2578 P. D.18 has not in your absence we desire him to forbear his money till arrival of some of our nation, in the time of the monsoon to pay it him and from Gombroon take off two chests of wine to present him, as two also you may take off for your house expences to our friends there, wo have wrote accordingly as also that you may have the use of the carpet and chairs. What monies that they have in Bunder you receive for goods sold convert into gold ***** * *, those that are stamped * with the effigy of Prince and none other there being of late many counterfeit of the other sort, concerning the obtaining of the house we must leave you to use such argument as may best prevail and take notice we shall not allow of any money to be spent upon it, we say any considerable, that is the amount of 3 or 400 rupees for, it would be cheaper for the Hon'ble Company to hire a house for their occasion than to lay out any quantity of money for that which is their own, and afterwards it will be charge enough to keep it in repair. Therefore endeavour so to act in this affair that the Hon'ble Company may have the least charge. We have not more to enlarge but wishes for your good health and a safe arrival unto your aforesaid friends. MATH. ANDREWES, JOHN LAMBTON. S wally M arine, ISth April 1661. XIII Consultation in Sural ye % 25th October lh61 The season of the y eare approaching wherein the Persian affaire was Persian Gulf. further to be considered, &amp; as promised proceeded on, the President conveen'd his Councell, &amp; thereunto called M_L Henry Revington, who latelie arrived here out of Persia, did read unto him the Hon^l® Compi^L Commission concern ing the Persian affaire, with severall letters from the PJL etc^ Councell in answeare to the said Commission; &amp; then they jointly proceeded &amp; fully debated the said affaire, from whence arose the following considerations: 1 st . That Whereas our Hon 1 ^ Employe were pleased (in their last yeares lett-I-) to promise a supply of three shipps this yeare for the prosecution of the aforesaid affaire and on further consider ation have sent fourth only one, our want of shipping is first &amp; principally to be considered. No less then eight being requisite for so great an undertaking, of wi^ number wee have at present but two, vizA the ' Constantinople MerohJ- ' &amp; ' Surat ' ffrigat: the ' American ' being required home, and the ' Eagle ' not capable of staying another yeare in the country through her defects &amp; discontent of her marriners : the ' Vine ** on a winter voyadge in the South Seas not expected untill may the ' Hopewell ' not yet arrived from Maccassar, &amp; the Wellcome ' lost in this river. 2 ly . The want of necessaries for the shipping. No supplye of salt meat for the men, or accoutrement for the shipps being here procure- able, nor any Port to friend (when our shipping shall lie in the Gulph) where fresh water may be obtained. 8 ly . The want of men for the shipping, first of Mariners, many being deceased, particularly of the &lt;s Eagles ' Company &amp; of those sent out by our Hon^ Employers for the better accomplishing this affaire. 2 ly of Ffactors, of w&lt;* here are but few, &amp; fewer of19 eminency, &amp; such this affaire doth require, at least two on each sbipp. 4 ly . The small burthen of our shipping, w£lL cannot containe J part of the goodes those Jounks carry, w 0 ^ must be taken out to find the goodes of the subject of the King of Persia. 5 ly . The power of the Dutch is too great to be overruled by our small force, the number of their shipping in Persia the two passed yeares assures us they are acquainted w^- our designe &amp; await an opportunity to affront us. 6 ly . The danger of our Employers Estate remayning in Persia undisposed off, to the amoA of ster, as wee were lately advised by the Agent at the Port, w^L upon approach of our shipping will certainly be seized on. 7 ly . The danger of those persons shall remaine here while the designers acting. Por wee cannot block up the Per sian Gulph, but this King will be sensible of the injury done to his Port; &amp; if wee have lately recA so great injuries from these people without offence given, what may wee expect when they have a pretended cause. Lastly, The want of a place or harbour for security of our shipping to winter in at our retourne from Persia, w^- at soonest will be the latter end of May &amp; then this coast w r ill be too dangerous to adventure on. Prom all w^ considerations there was this conclusion gathered (each person first declaring his readiness to undertake the designe had they but so many shipps as were nominated in the Commission, vizX six) that a force being wanting to goe through the works w^-honour &amp; repute to their Nation, pro- vissionof goods should be ordered for the lading home the Oharterparties shipps, &amp; this Persian affaire referred to our Masters furthA consideration for a larger supply of shipping &amp; men. The former business being determined the PresidX propounded the Comp^L Commission for the taking of Danda Rajapore Castle, but there was the same want of men &amp; shipping objected. The P^- also having a Commission directed to PJL Wyche, w^ was not to be opened untill the Persian action was finished (&amp; yet remaines sealed) supposing the same may give further instructions concerning Danda Pajapore that affaire lies dormant untill a greater force awake it.

A considerable quantity of Scindia goods being returned hither from Persia and Bussora as improper for those markets, we conclude it most for the benefit of our employers to send them to the market of Mocha. XV. Commission and instructions given, hy us the President ty Couneell of India, Persia, etc, unto our loving friende M^L. Richard Cradockproceeding as Agent in the negotiating of the Hon 1 ^ Comp~ Affaires in Persia fy are to be observed hy him there. Dated on Swally Marine yl^ 3J~ day of March Anno Domini 166^. Wee being sufficiently experienced of vojl abilities in yJL despatch of our Masters affaires in those employmii you have been put upon, have now con cluded &amp; appointed you Agent in Persia, death having deprived us of those ffriends wee sent thither last yeare ; wee also ordered Mjl George Cranmer your second &amp; to keepe the accompil, yourself having constant inspection into them, that there may be no mistake nor delayes as the former yeares have produced, nothing but promises no performances, yJL wee are ignorant of those passages most necessary to be knowne, w^ irregular course wee desise for the future you will prevent to be practiced. This wee here hinted first because of so much concernmJL it being 3 yeares almost since wee recA any accomp-L though Pfiower, who is at this tyme (wee know nothing to the contrarv) there resident &amp; hath but little of our Masters business to hinder y 6 accom. plishing of the rehersed, w^ is so material ; and though M jl Pflower may expect y_®-quality of seei_, yet for this maine reason, &amp; some other, wee conferr it on MJL George Cranmer, bee to succeed as third, or leave Persia for Surat. FooeXn the Wee sha11 now come to ac q usint y ou what needfull in order to yJL. Gomhroou'and see answer ' n S our HouS® Employers desires and our expectation. The ' Hope- rece'pmperly well' »ee having full laden w-ii freight goods, the great Cabin is reserved for sSbunder.' 'y our accommodation, therefore desire your repaire on board upon receipt of these, hoping in a months tyme it will please God to arrive you safe to the port of Gombroon, upon w'; h . giye notice unto Mi Mower, requiring his repaire a board unto you, informing you how affaires stand, &amp; that hee retourne to informe the Governour, Shawbunder etcJL officers of the towne of your arrivall, and in wi quality, that as accustomary they may give you a respective reception, w done their vissitt will follow, their custome being to be punc- tuall in ceremonies, wSt by you must be retourne, and will be soone passed over. In yi meane tyme you may be unlading the shipp of her freight goods &amp;ifa considerable freight for Bengala &amp; Metchlepatam is procurable, to cleane her at Ormuz &amp; send her thither. Wee say a considerable freight y± is more yi can be probably procured for Surat, w* wee would not have less valued yi 30U Tomaunds, if shee proceeds to those parts, but if shee retourne hither you need not make her cleane, but dispeed her wi^. what flreight procurable so soone as possible, hope in 10 dayes shee may be dis patched, you must not forget a large proportion of wine &amp; some fruit. or.tleastTooo 11 0n her Wee sha11 expect a P ort!on of Customes, so much as you can per- tomans for o'astomfi. swade the Shawbunder to part with, the practise of the Persian for these many yeares hath been still to cut off as much of the HonHs Companyes due as they could perswade our friends there to rest silent with, for w«A reason and many other not here mentioned, the Hon!# Company resolved of another course ton be taken them, besides faire words, yet hath not been put in practice, yet they feare w_L tbey deserve, &amp; hope it being civilly urged &amp; the advantage made use of may cause them to comply &amp; beget a more open hand then formerly, so yX wee shall not expect less then 1,000 Tomaunds, though get what you can, 400 or more on this shipp wee desire you to retourne. Robert Manly wee have now entertayned into wages in yJ- CompJL service at 6 Tomaunds salary yearly. Hee hath been a constJ- servant in the howse, &amp; now wee send him to wait on you, hee being not only furnished wJ^L language enough y_L qualifies him for an employment as Interpreter, but experience in treating wi 1 * the Okaun, Shaw-bunder &amp; officers of the towne, enables him to tell you what hath been the practice of your predecessors, besides Mjl Fflowers yeares Residence there, will render him to be Master of hy^ custome of the place, of both w^-you may make use, as you shall see occation, desireing you to be as frugall both in presents &amp; howse expences as possible. So much hath been the villanies &amp; baseness of Tockersee yX long since wee tourned him out of the Hon^? CompH- EmploymA and then sent for him to repaire hether y-X hee might have justice done him as on y^- side also of the Hon^ Company; but those wee employed failed us, &amp; M-^- Buckerridg promised to bring him but sickness prevented. Wee sent therefore Cap^- Middleton to force him hether, but if our expectation be not answered &amp; y4 you cannot procure his mission so much desired, wee doe by these presents discard him the Companyes service, and forbid him coming, into their howse, or any employmX in referrence to their affaires, having for the dispatch of w^i- affaires of theirs of jJ- nature as shall present, sent another along with you named Suntockee VetcherJL, having had experience of his abilityes, both here &amp; there also, as good security for his truth, therefore shall recommend him unto you for his encouragement. Death hath been so familiar in those parts caused by ill aire staying so Agent and Council long in it in Gombroon, to remedy it wee cannot deny you lycense of ^ r h a t z PJ' r 0 J e g ®^ n absenting your self out of it, either to Shiraz or Espahaun, &amp; though in during summer, either there will be but little of our Masters affaires to be acted, yet your presence will cause respect unto the Nation, &amp; in the spending of some few monthes in absence from Gombroon, recovery of yoZ- health, w ^ l cannot be obtained in yi place, but as before wee earnestly desire your frugality, j± the Honble Compi may not complayne of a costly factory. Much wee must leave unto yoA discretion, &amp; therefore desire your frequent advices, yJL in w4r y ou ma y wanting of information may be retourned &amp; supplied from us, w^, what our experience can furnish you. Our Masters advices are day lie expected, w^ wee give you libertie to open, &amp; take copies of keeping the contents very private, because wee suppose affaires of great consequence will be treated of in them, not fit for the view of all.

' Wee read in the front of yo _L. letter yJL great expectations you have of being better dealt with in Persia grounded upon a Letter from Gombroone of y— 3rd May subscribed by MJL Cradocke and M^. Cranmer, that y^ King had commaunded the Shawbunder to pay you y_^' full moyety of y4- Customes and that both hee and the other officers were more then ordinarily respective to them. Sure wee are there hath been nothing of reall p.formance in any one particuler and wonder they so little understood j J l temper and dispositions of those people as to thus highten your hopes, w^ certainly they would not have done had they thouroughly conversed wJ^ the perfidious practises of yAnation all along w ^L yoJL servant, who think themselves not at all obliged in honnoi to make good what they engage to you in verball expressions by way of complement. And of this M_L Cradock hath since felt y4- sad experience in dishonnours and affronts put upon our people, the Shawbunder lately commaunding to seize upon yoJL Broker and in his presence to bee most grieviously beaten y± hee was carried away doubtfull of life.24 And yet yA was not suffitient, whilst bee was in his cure of brusses bee had received, hearing there was hopes of recovery, sent for him againe Ruffins yJL dreg's him out of his bouse adding to bis sores &amp; afterwards laded Mm w~ irons and kept him close prisoner untill bee bad satisfied bis covetuous desires with some hundred of tomaus, all this while Mi Cradock not being able to helpe him in least, soe insolent they are being as it is said annimat'd by y_i Dutch, wbo are in great esteeme derived from tbeir power, having 3 or 4 great sbips yearly in yJL Eoad fro' y Bay and Coast y V come richly laden wi^ all sorts of commodities, as well from tbose parts, as Spices, Copper, Tinn from Battavia, Japon and Samatra, w^ makes them esteemed, but wee a dis- pised people. Wherfore since it is soe, and yJL in O-L oppinions nothing but a visible power can possibly redeeme and bring us to our former repute, wee would not that those large expences should outlive our liberties, whereby it is made yet a greater loss to you, your composition for last yeares cust_?_ was 650 tomans which is not so much by some hundreds of pounds as hath been spent in y_?_ solliciting for it. For other bussiness they have none, now y^_ you have forbidden us to trade for yoJ 1 , in y_!L or any other parte in India wherfore whilst yo r business is soe small there, there will need only a factour or two to be sent yearly at y4- latter end of yi Monzoones to demand the Customes as formerly adviced, but because it may be conclude doubtful whether any thing will bee paid when they shall see yJL ffactory drawne off, wee are resolved to enorder them at yJ^- time of heats and pestirouss aires to retire up into the Country some 15 or 20 miles and there reside and to goe no more to Spabaun, especially since it hath been so very expencive w^out any fruites, for although Ettamon Doulett should consent y^- Kjl should grant a mandate upon his serv^l at port in your favour, yJL procury whereof hath been both too frequently and suffiriently expencive to you wee doe not find it regarded makes us beleeve there is private contradictions given out in such cases, eloe would they not dare to disobey them so publiquely. All this considered &amp; weighed nothing can possible bee done to y^_ purpose, unless you express your dislike in a hostile way w^ Mi Cradock hath often solicited us too, giving bis opinion y^ with small force it is very facile to bring them to a speedy sence of their wronges done you, and doubts not of a conclusion to consent, but wee doe differ from him in judgment conceiving it to bee much more difficult then bee opmn's it, for wee doe conclude it may involve you into these following inconveniences and bee likewise expencive. Ffirst, it may bee very reasonable suspected whither yi King will so suddenly conclude an article with you, nay wee beleeve if there bee any demands of moneies for arreares, bee will stand out it may bee two three or more yeares, for bee hath no shipping and yi merch^ that resort thither are generally natives of yi country, and yet a ffleete must bee maintained if you once engage to block up his port that no bennefitt bee made off. Secondly, your force must bee considerable that yi Dutch may not bafle you which their insolency and pride will undoubtedlv attempt to doe to make themselves appeare great and to ingross the whole trade, for if so strong they will transport all merch*L goods, and then what need of amity with our nation. Thirdly, it may cause a breach betwene these dominiones and you, when this King shall bee acquainted with yJL obstructing his merchants m their trade and ruine of his port, w for a while will certainlv happen, and therefore must bee provided for if y^ King should bee by their meanes incensed, w.?_ the Dutche will forward what possible to a breach leaving noe stratagemes unattempted to bring tbeir ends about, and also to keep us out25 when they have done, which will bee ^ery destructive, when it shall bee con sidered that you have no manner of footing or settlement here in India, soe yJL your trade out and home may bee stopped for a time, w^ having well con sidered had wee (as wee have not) shipping sufficient for such an enter- price, we should not presume to engage you in a business of so great moment as things may succeed without first having yo_l. possetive orders for it, and so much wee have advised M^- Cradock etc. wishing them to informe you in all matters which wee hope hee hath or will doe. As also will bee able to main- taine his charge against M_ r r Andrewes in yS- abuse done you in giving his shipp yJL start of y-A. ' Hopewell ' soe much to your prejudice. Y_?- ffreight yA hee made of your pepper laden aboard yA. 'Ormous' you will find entered in folio 33 in your Journall P ; for which hee is accountable to you and likewise yx ingrossiug y^- freight backe, but here not having y±- copie of Mjl Cradooks to yoJ?- wee know not w_L furthJL to ansJL.

We like well also yi. yo^ aid not comply with the Caans unreasonable request of the ship to carry guns or soldiers; for it would have turned much to the Comp .r detrimn! in he demurrage, w?i we question whether ever the Caan would have satisfied fr it.

These matters, if true, are of evill con sequence such as we judge it our dutys to take cognisa^? of; shall not pass Or censure thereon; we will hear what Mr. Child hath to say in his owne vindication hoping he hath bin more prudently just and faithfull to our Honn^ Masters reputation &amp; interest then this information hath presented him to be; It having pleased God to restore Capt. Young in some measure to his health he now takes his passage on this ship Charles to your port to take charge of the Comp^ affairs as second to Mr. Bolt to whome we hope he will- be very useful assistant; and for that you write the merchants are generally discourage by ye molestation they receive from the Caan &amp; the Sbawbunder Wr we also are much sensible of from y t complaints of the merchants in genS. w c r come hither we desire you effectually to represent to yi sa: Cann &amp; Shawbunder as also to the King &amp; Ettamon Dowlett the very destructive consequences of such proceedings assuring y? yt HonnM® Comp a - will resent as injurious to themselves &amp; if they continue therein will not faile to doe y™ selves right in such a way as will not be pleasing Honn b i? or safe for the King of Persia or his Port. Wee have already advised yo° the HonnM? Comp* order that on Capt.

Wee take notice of yoJL want of tymber, and would gladly furnish you therewith if wee know how, for noe ships will carry itt, but at excessive rates, such as would make it unreasonably deare, its prime cost being 50 p. c± dearer y * formerly, and therefore wee desire you to supply yA defect yJL best you can there.32 Wee observe what you write about the Carpetts formerly desired for y^- Appollo and have reason to consider why you make soe great a dificulty of things soe feizablebut seeing it is a trouble to you wee shall ease you of it. Wee have furnished you with Europe wine and other refreshments for y^- Padrees &amp; yoJLselves according to yoi desires. John Floater And as to John Moats slave boy, it was very ill done in 0ap4- Clarke to (slave boy). ^ ^ ^ ^ p adrees If you can reC over y^. money for him you may, if not you must give John Efloate creditt for y^- value of him, and charge your accoii of presents therewith, for it is not reasonable he should suffer. Misbehaviour of You write of John Pfloates debt to yJL Company, but you do not tell us Johnson and Fifiid. | :)een C0I1 (; rac ted nor what it amounts unto nor have wee any of yoJL bookes to specific y^- particulars; thereof wee can only say y4- it will concerne you to secure y-^ Company what you can, for they will not approve of such irregular debts; what wee received here for his account is sould, and the proceed thereof brought to his credit in our bookes. Wee observe what you write touching y^- very imprudent carriage of M-i- Johnson and Pfeild w^ tended soe much to y-i- prejudice of yJL Hono% Company &amp; Nation, touching wj ^- wee called yH- here to a severe examina tion, before the Commanders of j±. Hono b i® Compel ships and others, and caused Cap4- Clarke, Mjl Limbery Englishmen to deliver their deposi tions on oath. But they declaring their ignorence thereof as to their owne knowledge, and saying they only heard it from you, and you alsoe not sending ns any other attestations of y^- English there with you yJL were of any weight, and Johnson and Ffeild utterly disavowing whatever you alleged against him, wee durst not undertake any rigorous proceedings against y^ without sufficient vidence, but have referred the case home to yJL Company to whome wee have sent charge, together with their answerr, &amp; j±- depositions taken coppies whereof wee herewith send you, and wee desire that you employ yoJL utmost power &amp; authority to forbid such naughty practices in y ±. future, for they are of dangerous consequence &amp; ill practice and may tend to y^- utter losse of o-L priviledges in y± Port. According to yo desire y _i.

Wee have recA noe meane trouble from y^. complaints of Young presented us in seviL petitions by her brother Lewis Gerverida, touching which wee have had sev_« meetings, &amp; upon the maine doe conceive yjL you might have adjusted all those differences without giving us further molestation; wee have perused y^- particulars of overcharges w^- you have taken out of Captain Youngs Bookes, which wee now againe returne unto you, for seeing you have recA sufficient ordii from y «- Company touching that affaire and are best Judge what charges are to be allowed and what not, wee leave y4 determination thereof wholly to you desiring you to doe Justice to y m G Company as alsoe to y_i_ widdow and orphans surviving. Death of fcha Wee now supply you with paper, ink &amp; quills, as much as oJL small linguist. stores will admit of. Wee are sorry for yJL death of Leny yJL Hono^? CompJL Linguist who wee judge was a good servant to them &amp; wee hope that Agga Donde and Issa Ckaun will well supply his place whome wee recommend unto you.33 Wee observe what you write about Tockerseys refusall to make good yJL united stookes demand. According to yoJL desire wee doe now confirme thei r said demand, &amp; you would have done well to have let us knowne what answer he made you, &amp; what he bath to say in his owne vindication, for it is not enough barely to deny, but he ought to give in answer to every article, w^- if he hath not done you will doe well to press him unto it, that these worthy gentlemen concerned may be y _?r better sattisfyed with yJL proceeding. Mi Samuell Carleton Ohyrurgeon hath made his applications to US for Leave and wages &lt; seviL months pay due to him, w c V he sayth was retained by you upon y-i. Surgeon Carleto11 ' apprehensions of some unkindnesse you thought good to conceive against him as if he were a sider or partaker in the irregularities of Oap_L Young of w£^ he declares himself totally innocent ; &amp; that he hath and ever had a true honour &amp; respect for you &amp; to yJL utmost of his power did serve you in yoi voyage outward bound and since in your dangerous sickness, &amp; never was wanting to doe his duty in obedience to such commands as you thought good to lay upon him. He much laments his hard fortune yA notwithstanding all his labours and services you should take soe severe a displeasure against him; lie hath therefore desired us to intercede with you that he may againe be readmitted into yoJLfavour and yJ- Companys service there, for w ^ l he was appointed by y_5_ Comp^ s generall order at 50 ILi per month as appeares by the clauses of their GeniL letters herewith sent you. Now seeing that yX said Doctor Carleton doth soe earnestly desire yo-I_ excuse for what is past, &amp; doth solemnly promise to behave himselfe to yoJL consent hereafter, and seeing the Compx have continued him in their service, and that he was chosen for yoJL- factory, and that noe other Ghyrurgeon can be procured, wee have thought good to recommend him againe unto you, and desire that you would receive him into y^ Compel service, and make good his wages to him from y^_ time of his first entrance at 50 R per month ; for during y^- time of his continuance here he hath been always serviceable either in Surat, Bombay or Hajapore ; for to such persons who have noe lively hood to depend upon but their wages it is not allowable by Law or Justice to detaine them from it pro vided they doe performe their dutyes to jS- best of their abilities of failure whereof wee doe not remember that ever you complained; and as to other faylings or indiscreet heats it will become yo^ prudence &amp; charity on his submission to passe them by, w^- alsoe wee shall take kindly from you if you receive him affectionately into yoJL favour upon oi recommendation. In a former letter wee advised you yX in obedience to y^- Comp^ express Appointment of orders wee have appointed James A dames to assist as second in their Adamassecorid * Pfactory of Persia who now takes his passage on ship ' Returne,' and wee desire you to receive him in said quality &amp; to deliver the Compf 8 bookes unto him; wee have alsoe appointed MJL Samuell Darnelly to be third, and would have James Adames and him to signe the GeniL letters and have cogni zance of all their affaires it being their expresse order, and seeing there will offer little businesse in Persia this yeare &amp; y^- ship 44 Keturne ' being bound to Bussorah with ffreight goods and will require an able person for y_?_ man- nadgement of yX affaire wee have thought good to appoint MJL James Adames for that service &amp; at his returne from Bussorah to stay at Gombroone as before. We desire you to furnish him with all things necessary for his voyage and stay at Bussorah with bridle and sadle, semeanoes, canatts, what disbursements are made thereon must be charged to y^ ships acco-1. 2578 F D.34 Wee have endeavored to procure some old ffashion silver lace for y4- Ckaune of Larr but none could be found in all yi towos, it any can be got by y4- next ships it shall be sent you. The ' Sied Pore ' Merchant hath stole away without taking o^. passe, w^- is a slight and disrespect wee shall not admitt off; wee therefore desire that in case any of oX ships be in Port when she is there y4- you. order some Englishmen to make a pretended seasure of her, &amp; threaten to make her a prize; but upon their submission, and acknowledgemi of their ffault, you must surrender her againe, and take care that noe damadge in the least be done unto her by oJL men. This wee designe onely to preserve oS- repute &amp; respect with these Merchants, who otherwise will neglect &amp; grow bold and despise oi nation and the Comp^?- authority. Accounts.

It is now 4 yeares since wee received any from you and therefore wee desire you not to fayle to send us yoZ- accounts by y^ first ships; the excuse you make for want of Paper is noe waye to be admitted off, for surely you might have been supplyed for yJL money a y e Dutch house or yJL lffrench, for yo . r r bookes are but a small bulke, &amp; will not require much. Wee are frequently disappointed of Paper from the Company but should be ashamed to make that a pretence not to send home their bookes of acco-ii. We are necessitated to mind you of yi particular in regard the Company doth severely chide us when they have not the bookes of each ffactory yearely sent home, wherefore wee desire you not to fayle us hereafter. The HonoM? Company have enordered us to send some 400 bales of Carmania and have ordered it to be picked very cleane &amp; well packed, w5k wee desire you to provide and send us by ship ' Returne ' or ' Selymony,' for wee shall want that full quantity for y±. lading of 0- r - ships home for England, and therefore doe expect that you will not fayle us therein. Gombroon customs. TIie HonoM5 Company having strictly required of us to send oi opinions touching the present state of their affaires in Persia, &amp; to propose some meanes whereby the King of Persia may be brought to allow a more equall share of y.A. customes of Gombroone to them, wee have thought good to communicate to y?^ oJL Judgement, thereof in a paper, w^ wee have sent them by the last shipps, copy whereof wee herewith send for yo^ perusall, &amp; wee desire that you will afford us yoJL sence, whether or noe what wee have proposed be practi cable or noe or any wayes prejudicial to y-i. Hono^ Company. In case that y^ &lt;£ Selymony' or ' Returne ' should not returne from Bussorah timely enough to bring the Compel wool to be laden for England on yJL yeares expected Meet, yJL wee would have you send it on y^- first ship that presents for yi port the beginning of next Moonsoon. Wee are at present in greate want of horses having disposed of ox 2 best to yJL Governour. W ee therefore doe desire you to provide &amp; send # by yJL returne of y^- ship 5 very good horses as well for presents to Gov-L. and others as for o^ owne use.35 Wee had once contracted a bargaine with some Armenians here for all Compel perpetuannaes to be delivered in Gombroone free of all charges, but since they have broke off wee desire you to satisfy us whether they are in request in Persia and whether you would have us send you any, &amp; upon rec -i- thereof wee shall supply you with what quantities, &amp; colours you desire. The enclosed GeniL to y ®- HonO^® Company wee desire you after porusali to send forward to y-i- Consull of Alleppo, together with yJL list of Europe commodities vendable here, commeoding them to his particuler care for further ance ; soe committing you to jS.

XXIX. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 2 OF 1723-1724. Consultation of the Pkesident &amp; Governor in Council. Bombay Castle, 6 April 1724. Read and approved our last consultation. The President acquaints the Basrah affain. Board the occasion of this meeting is to consider of the state of our Hon'ble Master's affairs in Persia and the needful directions to be given that agency by the Compton now under despatch for Gombroon and first our settlement at Bussorah, where it is observed there is nothing yet done for the advantage of our Hon'ble Employers, more than a promise obtained from the Bashaw that we shall pay but three per cent. Duties on the Broad cloth none of which being disposed of at the time Mi- Houssay dispatched those advices, The prospect he gives us of selling it seems rather an amusement than any real application to serve bis Employers while he continues so much involved in private Trade. The President further informs the Board thathe has several representa- Affairs of the late tions made him from the claimants, inhabitants of Gombroon, on the Estate of Mr * WngIlt - Edmund Wright deceased, that there are also other demands on him here and from other parts of India that the said M^ Isaee Houssay has carried with him to Bussorah the greatest part of the said M^ Wright's effects without giving the parties any satisfaction, neither has he transmitted us copy of the deceased's will, whereby he might be authorized to act therein or given us any account of the deceased's Estate. That it is reported to him, the Resident, which * One of the then Members of the Bombay M ?f John* Hope also declares to have Government. heard, that the said M^ Houssay will not return to Gombroon, but go from Bussorah to England, all which taking into consideration, and apprehending our Hon'ble Master's credit may he38 affected by any of their chiefs withdrawing without adjusting the accounts of those who have demands on them, and it being also the positive orders of the Hon'ble Company that none of their servants shall repair to England with out leave first obtained from hence or their coming hither. It is resolved that Isaec Houssay be recalled from Bussorah to Gombroon, in order to adjust the accounts of the creditors of the deceased Edmund Wright and himself, but be allowed to take his station there according to his standing in the service. And for the better establishing that settlement, resolved that we recommend it ^o the Agent to repair thither unless his stay at Gombroon shall be found more necessary, that then Edmund Edlyne go to Bussorah and take with him such assistance as can be spared. Signed likewise a notification to be made at Bussorah requiring all the subjects of Great Britain Trading under the Hon'ble Company's protection to be conformable to the Rules of the factory and positively forbiding them to treat with the Government in any matters relating to their Trade but through the factory. XXX. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 3 OF 1727-1728. Bombay Castle, 16th January 1728. The Bussorah letters brought us by the Brittannia are dated the l^th ^gth 0 f November. In the former Mi Erench confirms the hopes he European houses« before gave ue of a parcel of woollen goods being to be disposed of to advantage Basrah. Friendly the auantitv does not exceed sixty Bales of Broad cloth , and one disposition of the J , i i « , . » Pasha. News from hundred of perfects. He advises that soon arter the date of his former letter King Gforge e i! h of the Bashaw made a demand of five cruz a Head from the Persian Servants in the European Houses—the Dutch who were first called upon could not evade it, and therefore discharged their servants, but he thinking it inconsistent with the reputation of our Hon'ble Masters to abandon those under their protection, or comply with the demand, positively refused either, pleading and insisting that by the Phirmaund granted to the English, they were exempted from such impositions, offering to deliver up the same again if it was not intended to be conformed to, which at last had the desired effect. That upon the arrival of the Brittannia, the Bashaw sent to Venow the reason why he did not hoist the English Flag as usual seeing he bad given liberty for it, upon which Mr Erench took occasion to let him know it was because the late Khya insisted upon a present which he could not answer giving. The Bashaw replied that the Khya had used both him and us very ill, but as he was now dead and past his resentment, desired every thing may be buried in oblivion, at the same time sending an order by the Deputy Khya to our former Landlord to let us have his house, directing him not to return till he had seen our Elag hoisted which was accordingly done; Afterwards at the Bashaw's desire French paid him a visit who received him very kindly, giving him many assurances of his friendship and good inclinations to encourage the British Trade to that art. As house rent is very dear there, he offers it to our consideration whether a part of it should not be borne by the private goods that shall here after be lodged in the factory. He further advises that they have certain news of the Turks coming to an agreement with the Ophyoons, and that Achmat Bashaw was expected to arrive at Bagdat in a few days. That Consul An important regulation. Demand for tax from Persian servants in39 Purnell writes he has received advices from Constantinople of the Death of ^ igt His Majesty King George* at Osnabrug in his way to Hanover, and that the siege of Gibralter was raised by the Spaniards.

The Hon'ble Company's Account curr^ and List of the outstanding debts at Bussorah, also manifest of Preight laden on the Brittania for Surat and Bombay amounting to fifty six thousand five hundred seventy five Shahees and five guz and if a vessel comes thither in the month of October and is permitted to remain there till the middle of December, he says he does not in the least doubt meeting with good Freights annually. The Boats from Bagdat and the caravan from Alleppo generally arriving about that time. Concerning the outstanding debts he * observes that for want of notes being taken from several of the debtors they pretended they had paid them, and some of them are ready to swear to it which gives him a great deal of trouble, however he promises no endeavours shall be wanting on his part to recover t^em, and has got security fpr the payment of ^wede shrophV debt in five months' time which is the best composi tion he was able to make. His short Letter of the 18 th advises that a Cossat was arrived from Aleppo with a confirmation of His Majesty's death. That the preliminarys to a Treaty were signed by the Emperour and the allies, one of the articles whereof is, that the Ostenders shall not trade to the East Indies for the space of seven years, and it is not doubted but at the designed congress at Aix la Chappell the same will be for ever laid aside. That a cessation of Arms is agreed upon between Spain and Great Britain, and it is not questioned but the War is at an end. XXXI. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 3 OF 1727-1728.

That Iron is at present in no demand occasioned by the troubles of Avive and Sanstere which are the places that take off that commodity. That the Government continues very favorable, and the Bashaw in very strong terms has again renewed his assurances of protection and encouragement to the trade of our nation, but he much fears he shall not be able to preserve the present good disposition if any further demand is made on account of former extortions. He encloses the account consulage collected at Bussorah from the 31^ July to the January, amounting to Mamoodies twenty six thousand, nine hundred and four, and nineteen Goz with the Hon'ble Company's account current, the Balance whereof being mamoodies eleven thousand, eight hundred, sixty two and four Goz he will wait the Chief and Council's orders how to dispose of.40 Mahomet Pasha ■ . j tt - C ^ 0se his Letter he advises that Mahomet Bashaw was appointed Bashaw appointed Viceroy ! rr of Baghdad of that place, whose Khya or second was just then arrived to take possession of the Government for him.

They (the Chief in Council at Gombroon) enclose copy of the last Bussora General (letter) to Gombroon and of Mi Stanyan's letter to the British Traders at Bussora, enclosing the Sultan's order to that Bashaw for complying with the terms stipulated with that Government on M^. Houssage's first arrival which M^ Trench accordingly delivered to the Bashaw, but it referring to the capitulations which neither of them had, he said he could not comply with regard to the customs until he heard further from Court, where upon M^ French addressed the Ambassador by an express acquainting him therewith. XXXIII. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 5 OF 1727-1728. Bombay Castle, the 9 t J! December 1728, Imported the Fame Frigate and Fort George Galley from Surat By the Fame we received Letters from Bussorah and Gombroon dated the 12^ &amp; 31^ October The former advises in substance what the Resident had before wrote to Gombroon, copy of which was sent us by the Fort S ■■ George Mr. French think ing himself affronted by the - » - o- Pasha leaves Galley, and further that in the month of August last, the Government seized Ijairan and retums - on apology being made. upon his Linguist, and put him in Irons, on pretence that he had taken upon himself to act as Trustee to a deceased Armenian's Estate without an order a usual from the Cauzy. Mi French thinking himself affronted in the person of his servant thought fit to resent it by retiring with the rest of the English on Board the Brittania, where he had not been long, before the Captain Bashaw sent him word that his servant was released and desired he would come ashore to receive him, but he insistad on his being delivered up aboard, which was accordingly done, and the Captain Bashaw sent his second, to invite him to bis House. M^ French then went ashore and the Bashaw gave him assurances of all the favour and protection he could desire, and a Phirmaund, that in case any of our servants for the future commit any crimes we shall have the liberty of punishing them ourselves, and when any disputes shall arise about debts or contracts with the country people the Cauzy shall examine the affair in presence of our Resident, and in case he (the Resident) shall think the sentence not equitable it shall not bind till the Bashaw upon a fair hearing confirms it, so this affair ended much to our advantage. He advises further that the Boats from Bagdad not being arrived at the date of his Letter he fears he shall not be able to dispatch the Brittania before the 1 *1 December, but hopes to obtain a very considerable Freight for her before that time and that late advices from Aleppo say that war is likely to break out in Europe ; the King of Spain had renewed his pretensions to Gibralter and Port Mahon supported therein by the Empi 8 of France and Russia, and that the Dutch seem inclinable to stand Keuter.41 XXXIV. PUBLIC DEPAETMENT DIARY No. 4 OF 1731. Bomlay CaHle, the 21% November 1731. Substance Gombroon, The Phirmaund obtained by Mr. French from the Bashaw of Bussorah Phirmaund for the English paying only three per cent, customs on all goods sold at that French at Port, will be highly advantageous to private trade, and as he has been at so Ba8rab - large an expense in obtaining it purely out of regard to the public good. We are willing to grant him all the Relief we can, and we direct them to order him to open a head on the Bussorah books of charges in procuring a Phir maund in favor of the English Trade debiting it for the whole amount of the expense with the growing interest thereon, and in that expense let be included, 3,000 cms as a gratuity for Mi French's trouble, and let him credit the paid account by accountant consulage for the consulage annually collected, until the Principal and Interest is paid; by tnis means the debt contracted for procuring the Phirmaund becomes the Company's and for their reimbursement we direct an additional Duty of one per cent, be laid on all trade carried on by the English to the Port of Bussorah as well by the Company as private persons trading under their protection until the said sum in Principal and Interest thereon, according to the custom of the place, is fully cleared and no longer. XXXV. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 6 OF 173.5. Bombay Castle. On the 30th August 1733, the Agent in Council at Gombroon, informed Letter f rom the Bombay Government that they had just received a letter from the Resident Gombrooo! 11 at Bussorah containing the following intelligence; 'The Grand Vizier had^masp)^7' defeated Thomas Caun near Bagdat and killed 50,000 men on the spot shahr^ 8 ^ that the engagement lasted with great fury several hours, and that the Troops, Thomas Caun left to Blockade Bagdat were almost all cut off by a sally made from the Town by Ahmud Bashaw, a small party excepted, with their General Mahmud Caun Bullouch, and that the Vizier had sent a Bashaw with a detach ment of horse to pursue Thomas Caun as far as Ahmadoon and there to stay until further orders; about a month before this news came they had, they say, received Thomas Caun's answer to Mr. Home's remonstrance and the Agent's letter, couched in very complaisant terms, in which he sent an order to the Shawbunder and Supravisors to desist from their demands of the arrears of customs and told them as soon as he had taken Bagdat he would grant our gentlemen a renewal of all their ancient privileges. They moreover advise us that they had ordered Mr. Geekie in case the Turks should march to Spahaun to retire to Gombroon with all the Company's Rogoms, Books, Papers and valuable moveables, but not to quit the city until they were sure of their being near. The troubles at Bussorah occasioned by the neighbourhood of the Persian Army has, they say, prevented a bale of goods being landed out of any of the ships, so that there will be little or no Consulage this season.' 2578 F.

Entry of Tamftsp The Agent in Council at Gombroon in a further letter, dated the 20^ Khan into Basrah. geptember 11S4i} ^ted that in their last advices from the Eesident at Bussorah they had been informed that &lt;c Thomas Caun after making a magnificent entry into that City (spreadings being laid in the same manner as for the King) gave audience to a Turkish Envoy, and presented him with a cullat and two hundred Tomands in money, which Minister on his taking leave publicly declared that the Grand Seignior would never consent to a peace unless Shaw Thomas was again set upon the Throne ; Thomas Caun made answer that he designed it, and had already sent for him, but he only ordered the King should be removed from Mazandroon to another Palace.' XXXVII. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 9 OF 1735-1736. Bombay Castle , 6 October 1735. Threatened second The Persia advices received by the Robert are now read which gives us a SSnst Basrah^ 1011 very melancholy account of the state of affairs in that Kingdom and as the gentles Sngdrfggfd^to men by remaining on shore would have more immediately exposed themselves the war. Da to resentment of Thomas Caun and they might have also been surprised when the Persians would have insisted on such terms that we could on no account comply with ; whereas by their retiring this evil will not only be prevented but the Persians convinced of our resolution to leave the Kingdom when we can no longer remain there with credit, and the clamours of the merchants may have such an effect, aa to induce Thomas Caun to believe our continuance is of service to the Kingdom and to hearken to a considerable treaty for fixing of our privileges ; we think the proceeding of the gentlemen on this occasion to be prudent and well calculated to avoid the evils as well as obtain the advantages proposed. But as they are of opinion that the Persians are fully bent upon a second expedition against Bussorah, and that Thomas Caun will insist upon our assisting him by sea against the Turks, and that he will be pacified on no other terms. We are apprehensive that the Agent arriving there in the Queen Caroline during this confused situation of our affairs may be at a great loss how to proceed at so critical a conjuncture, and as it is possible the Queen Caroline may not yet have passed by this Port in her pas sage to Persia. The President proposes dispatching a boat in quest of her with positive orders to Captain Wilkie to return into this road, and that copy of the Persia advices be sent to Mr. Cockell that being apprized of the state of affairs his experience may furnish us with helps for giving the necessary orders on this important occasion, proposing to send him to Gombroon as soon as possible after his arrival, but should the boat not meet with the Queen Caroline and she have proceeded on her voyage, it will be proper to dispatch a vessel to Gombroon towards the latter end of this month with such instructions as shall then seem necessary to be given which being entirely agreeable to the opinion of the several members is unanimously agreed to.43 XXXVIII. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 9 OP 1785-1786. Bombay Castle, 22 October 1735. Proceedings of a special Council held hy the Bombay Government for the purpose of determin ing upon the measures which it would he proper to adopt as regarded the Hon'hle Company's affairs at Bussorah and at the Factories in the Persian Gulf, with reference to the then unsettled state of affairs between the Persians *and Turks. Resolutions passed. The President acquaints the Board that by the advices he has received from Goa he apprehends the Queen Caroline has missed the orders that were sent for her returning hither and consequently passed by this port in her way to Gombroon, and therefore he has desired this meeting to take into consideration the last advices from Persia, and to resolve on some proper instructions to be given the Agent purposing also speedily to return the Prince of Wales Galley with Mess' Waters, Wettwell, and Ray to the Agent's assistance. We find the Persians seem bent on demanding the assistance of our shipping and men in their second enterprize against Bussorah, and we fear they will very stifly insist on this point as the only reasonable raparation we can make them for preventing the success of their first attempt against that city. Tho' in Europe any power can stop the shipping of any nation in their ports, and employ them for transports, or other services, and the same not be esteemed any breach of the peace in the party thus forced, yet we are very doubtful what may be the consequences of our making such a condescension to the Persians, since we are strictly cautioned not to commit any act of hostility or give any extraordinary umbrage to an European state in amity with his Britannic Majesty, as in either of these cases we apprehend our Hon'ble Master's Charter would be greatly affected ; besides, the Turks being a people soon irritated to extravagant revenge, they might in the first transport of their disgust at our appearing against them make such seizures of our European Merchants' effects in their country and even treat their persons so ill as would bring upon us a very severe resentment and therefore we must positively forbid the Agent, &amp;?., lending our vessels to the Persians for this service on any terms. But if the Agent, i n debating with the Persians on this point find that the selling them of a ship or two is the only means they have left to soften them and induce them to waive their other demands and that it fully appears the Hon'ble Company's estate and privileges in that Kingdom cannot be secured on any other terms, we think in such case we may give them a liberty to make use of this expedient, which however is not without its inconveniences and therefore they must be cautioned not to make use of this liberty, but at the last extremity, and to look on it as a medium proposed to prevent a greater evil. As the Persians have not yet been able to remove their Ambassador's effects from Scindy which, we understand, are very valuable and now lie ready to be embarked for Persia. The President proposes that the Galley be ordered to call in there and that M^ Waters be allowed to offer the transporting of the Ambassador's people and effects to Gombroon, and as the Galley will be near full of provisons for herself and the Rose and may be able (if the Persians44 consent) to take in but a small part of the effects; he further offers on this extraordinary emergency in behalf of himself and the other owners of the Robert and Jenny that those ships the former of which is to proceed in com pany with the Galley and the latter now at Scindy be both employed on this service if it shall be found necessary, desiring no more than fifteen hundred rupees freight for each ship which is not more than their sailing charges, and if from an absolute necessity they shall be detained by the gentlemen in the Gulf a demorage of four hundred and fifty rupees each per month, and he will also empower the Agent, to sell one or both of said ships to the Persians under the limitations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The President is induced to offer and we to accept of these proposals on considering that if Mr. Waters, &amp;l a ., should succeed in this point a very considerable pledge will be secured in our own hands, and must, we think greatly contribute towards ending our differences on more reasonable terms besides as it was hoped that the Hose Galley would be sent from Gombroon to Scindy on this service, should she be there, the Galley and other vessels return ing with her, must put a better face on our affairs, and if the Agent, &amp;£? are pressed with such hard conditions that they cannot consent to these effect will be more easily secured, and if matters should come to such an extremity and that no good is to be done with the Persians but that the Hon'ble Com pany's effects and private concerns are seized, we think it our duty, and accordingly, it is agreed to give positive orders, to the Agent, dfe, to take and secure not only the Ambassador's effects, if on board our ships, but the Arab ships that are known to be now in the Gulph, and all other vessels belonging to Persian sujbects, and in particular to make what reprisals they can on the Persian fleet and obstruct as much as in them lies any trade from being carried on in the Gulph, and that we give the Agent, permission to send our vessels up to Bussorah, that if the Persians do attempt it by land and are likely to take it, they may being away what they can of the merchants' and their effects, by which something considerable may be earned, and it is these considerations which incline us to think the countenance of a ship or two more than the Galley is really necessary, and it is the number of vessels not the quality (which the Persians are not well enough acquainted with to distin guish) that will sensibly affect them and prove advantageous to the gentlemen in their negotiations. We have thus considered the worst side of our affairs; but the gentlemen in their advices seem to hope that the step they have hitherto taken may cause a more favorable turn and produce some good effect, perhaps a motion from the Persians themselves to compromise this unlucky business, and if it should so happen that it would naturally draw after it a treaty for fixing the Hon'ble Company's privileges on a better footing than they have been for some time past, to obtain which, all solicitations hitherto have proved ineffectual, but this, we apprehend, will occasion some charge and whether we shall in this case ascertain a quantum or leave it to the Agent's, prudent management strenuously pressing them to reduce it as low as possible, is here to be con sidered ; we are sensible the Hon'ble Company will little care to be at any considerable expense for obtaining a confirmation of their grants while the Empire is in so unsettled a state, and, on the other hand, their affairs bein^ brought into confusion by such unforeseen incidents, it cannot be expected they will at this juncture be in any manner retrieved without some expensewhich we must leave to the Agent, discretion, being persuaded, their best endeavour will be used to reduce the same as low as possible. But as the unlucky affair at Bussorah (of which the private traders only reaped the advantage) first gave rise to these troubles. We think it but reason able that the expense occasioned thereby should be repaid by the trade of that Port, and therefore it is agreed that the additional duty be continued till our Hon'ble Masters shall be reimbursed the whole charge they have already and shall hereafter be put to on this occasion. Should our gentlemen succeed so far as to commence a treaty fo r fixing of our Hobble Masters* privileges, we apprehend that our insisting on the grant of one thousand Tomands per annum out of the customs may greatly retard if not put an entire stop to this good work, as we cannot suppose the Persians will consent to pay us such a sum when we are well assured the whole net customs of the place have not furnished the Royal Treasury with that sum for several years past, and we find that when Mirzah Togghy was down at Gombroon he very frankly told the gentlemen that the enjoyment of this emolument for upwards of one hundred years past has very amply com pensated for any services we may now offer to put in the scale on this account, and the reason of this argument is more strongly enforced against us when the Persians plead their inability to assent to this proportion from the extra ordinary calamities their Country has so long suffered and which entirely deprived them of the very advantages on which this grant is founded, we must therefore give the Agent, &amp;®*., a latitude to alter this point of our demand, and if they can prevail with the Persians to grant a reasonable moiety of the customs to be paid us directly on any freight goods brought to that port on English Shipping. We think it will be obtaining a more beneficial article for our Hon'ble Masters than persisting so tenaciously on our old grant; &amp; we hope his offer will be readily entertained by the Persians as it will convince them more than any other arguments can that our interest and theirs are inseparable, and that if freight offers for that port we can never be supposed to refuse it which at present they entertain an extreme jealousy of, and think we not only neglect it but influence every body to carry their goods to Bussorah, and if our gentlemen succeed in this point and the Persians shew any distrust by our continuing a Resident at Bussorah. It is agreed to permit them to recall M * French to convince the Persians of our sincere intentions to increase the trade of their ports. The remarks made by the gentlemen on Captain Robert's proceeding to Bussorah immediately after what had been done there without consulting them, makes it necessary for us now to consider how far the Agent, should be empowered to act in the like emergencies. If the affairs of Persia should be again settled on any tolerable basis, we think we ought to endeavour effec tually to prevent our being embroiled in troubles of the like nature again which as long as this war lasts between the Turks and Persians we may con tinually be liable to, and therefore it is agreed that during the contests between the two Empires we give the Agent, &amp; C A, a discretional liberty to hinder all ships trading under the Hon'ble Company's protection from proceeding to Bussorah if they shall find it necessary so to do for the preservation and security of our Hon'ble Masters' effects and privileges in Persia, or to prevent any detriment happening to their affairs, but they must be cautious of making use of this liberty without an apparent necessity, and if done with any sinister views they must expect a severe punishment to be inflicted on the transgressor.46 XXXIX.

The Queen Caroline appearing in the offing from Gombroon, the Com^ sent ashore a letter from the Agent, &amp;c. there dated lA* December acknow ledging the receipt of ours of the 25^ August by the Queen Caroline who arrived there with the Agent the 20^ of November, also our letter of the 26^ October by the Prince of Wales Galley, who arrived the 29^ &amp; advising that they have laden on the Queen Caroline one hundred and eighteen bales of Carmenia Wool, two hundred bags of copper goz, forty bags of lump copper &amp; fifty chests of Shyrash wine. That the French ship mentioned in their last did not sail for Bussorah till the 6^ of November, having sold her cargo &amp; paid four and a half per cent, customs and before the Supra Cargo went away, she received a letter from Thomas Caun insisting the French to resettle their factory at Gombroon &amp; as they pay customs will give them great encourage ment, &amp; they are afraid this example will in the end induce him to oblige the Dutch &amp; us to do the same. He has lately sent a strange Uogom to Mirza Togghy concerning us, wherein it is said we shall be free as far as one thousand Tomands value per annum or as much more as Mirza Togghy shall think lit. That the Rose Galley sailed the 15^ of September to bring the dece'^ ambassador's effects with Seffy Oaun Begg &amp; Mahmud S'ued Begg on board whom the Commander had orders to treat in the best manner he could and to convey back such boats as they should hire to bring the Elephants and horses, notwithstanding which be disagreed with them and returned without them or the boats and they on their arrival complaining of this treatment the Gentlemen were obliged to make them a present to prevent their complaining to Thomas Caun which might have had a very ill effect. Their view in this proceeding is to keep the Persians easy and thereby gain time for recovering what they can of the Hon'bl? Company's effects and outstanding debts till they see what turn this storm will take. That they did not think proper to risque the Woollen Goods sent them on the Queen Caroline ashore, but as the broker had given them hope to dispose of them in a short time they have transhiped them on board the Rose. The merchants complaining very much of the last parcels. They send us two musters of the fine which are not better than the cloths charged fifty per cent, less &amp; the Drabs are very bad. That on the Agent's arrival they at first thought of not going ashore till they should be invited but considering that they might have remained some time on board &amp; thereby occasioned the Queen Caroline to be very late despatched &amp; perhaps at last been obliged to come and leave the Hon'ble Company's broker &amp;c., and their effects at the mercy of the Persians they went ashore and the Agent was visited by the Shawbunder, &amp;c., with abundance of compliments as if nothing had happened when Mahmad Zamen Beg delivered him letters from Mahmad Togghy Caun &amp; Mirza Togghy desiring him to supply Thomas Caun with Shipping for which he would pay the full value they thought it not proper to disoblige but told them they would write to procure two ships of twenty Guns each provided they would first deposit the money which would amount to eight thosand Tomands with which answer they seemed well satisfied, and they desired the Agent would write answers to Thomas Caun &amp; Mirza Togghy47 Caun's letters which he has done and reminded the latter of his promise to get our Eogoms renewed if we furnished them with shipping which they say they are far from expecting and only look that step in order to know the Persians' intentions towards them. That when the Robert arrives if Thomas Caun continues his solicitations for ships they will sell her to him for the money they can get in hopes by setting a great price on her that he will be tired of thinking to keep up a marine force in the Gulph when he finds it attended with so great an expense. They reply to the several par^-! of our Hon'ble Masters' commands relating to that age ncy, which being chiefly remarks on the expenses, they assure us all possible frugality is observed* They say that as 8pahaun Factory is withdrawn &amp; their garrison sent away } they hope their settlement will shortly become a gaining article to the Hon'ble Company. As the Persians were concluding a peace with the Turks^ beS^he T^ks they believed they should have no occasion to recall French or to hinder ^ any ships going to Bussorah and they also hoped the Persians would not want will not be recalled, the assistance of their ships against the Turks, but should they demand them for that service they are resolved not to comply &amp; will, if possible, get out of their power by retiring on board. Four days after the date of their advices they received a letter from Mirza Togghy promising to get thei r Rogums renewed and enclosing one from Thomas Caun acknowledging the service they had done him in carrying Seffy Caun Beg to Scindy &amp; desiring them to come to an agreement with Mirza Togghy about supplying him with shipping and after that they received advices that Mirza Togghy's son was coming down to Gombroon with only one hundred and eighty men whose errand they believed was to negotiate the affair of buying ships or to enquire into the reason of assisting the Turks at Bussorah, but as they apprehended he will endeavour to extort a present from them they are resolved to be upon their guard &amp; when the Caroline is despatched to lade what they can of their Effects with three months' provisions on board the Galleys and if they find they have good grounds for their apprehensions they will retire on board themselves and write to Mirza Togghy's son and the Gov^ that they are resolved to leave the settlement unless Thomas Caun will confirm their ancient grants and privileges &amp; they will also write to him &amp; wait his answer which they think must open a treaty &amp; at once discover his inclinations towards us, for to remain any longer under the uncertainty they now do after having so often threatened to leave the place will be only exposing the Com pany's affairs &amp; their own persons to more insults &amp; oppressions and in the end they will be forced to retire. However they will, if possible, wait to know ^ r0S P g e p t ^ f an the event of a General Council of the Governors of provinces, Cities &amp; Chiefs being elected m of tribes he has summoned to meet him at Casbin with whose advice and con- sent he designs as he pretends to establish a form of Government to be observed over the whole empire. The king, it is said, is to be present but whether he is to be reinstated in the Throne or not is not declared, the most reasonable of the several conjectures upon this head seems to be that Thomas Caun after having made a long Pration of the services he has done the nation by the wonderful success that has attended his Arms will demand their opinion, who they think the properest person to sway the Empire the King or himself as regent in expectation that the people (as no doubt they will with one voice) through fear immediately elect him king, which they think he will readily accept of &amp; seat himself in the Throne &amp; when he has done that 'tis reasonable to suppose he will govern in a different manner from what he has48 hitherto done. But should the king be restored there fears are at an end as the former rogoms obtained of him will be in force. They enclose an Indent of sundrys still wanting to complete the factory repairs. The work at present is at a stand except the wharf which they are finishing. That the Persians may not suspect the apprehensions they are under. They have opened a head on their books of Bussorah troubles which shall be cleared by the additional Proposal to send duty at Bussorah. If they come to an agreement with the Persians they will CarmanL. 0 send Whitewell to Carmenia, otherwise it will be better to decline carrying on the Wool Investment than by doing it to give the Persians room to think they are satisfied to remain in the kingdom without our privileges being renewed. Geekie will take passage on one of the Galleys when they will return M^Veaelst as the number of servants there without him will be sufficient. XL. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 9 OF 1735-1736. Visit of Mr, French to Baghdad to Bombay Castle April 1736. Received also a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon, dated the letter from 20th March, forwarded by the Prince of Wales Galley advising that Gomb^oon • Mr. Waters having completed his enquiry into Mr. French's conduct and fully acquitted him of any fraud either in the Consulage or Sale of Cloth. They enclo. Cops of Mr. Water's letters to the Company on that occasion. That Mr. Prench had been at Bagdat to complain to the Bashaw of the treatment he had received from the Musseleem, which has been redressed and as such an undertaking must be attended with a considerable expense they had allowed Mr. [French One hundred Tomands in part thereof directing him to charge it to the head of Bussorah Customs since the traders in general will find the benefit of this proceeding. The freight of the Galley from Bussorah for Surat amounts to mamoodies eleven thousand six hundred and forty, and sixteen goz, and they have laden on her Treasure and Wine to the amount of Shahees one hundred ten thousand sixty seven &amp; three goz. They designed to have sent Capt. Harris &amp; the other prisoners on this Vessel, but the Com mander intimating that he had some men whose principles he had reason to suspect, they resolved to detain them till another opportunity. The Northumberland &amp; Sarah Galley sailing up the Gulph and they not having accounts of a peace being concluded protested against the Supra Cargoes, &amp; if the Severn (who they are advised is bound to Bussorah) touches there they shall practice the like in regard to her. They have certain advices that Thomas Caun has accepted the Crown &amp; is stiled Shaw Nadar; &amp; they have Crtg?un!ooo g P rivate in^rmation that all our privileges are enewed, * even the thousand Tomands per annum, but if this is true it can be owing to nothing but their promise of furnishing him with ships &amp; he has actually given positive orders to the Govt, of Shyrash &amp; that place to furnish the agent with eight thousand Tomands or One hundred &amp; sixty thousand rupees to pay for them; The Gentlemen say that as Thomas Caun is firmly bent upon increasing his fleet &amp; has accepted of this offer (which was only meant as an amusement) they desire we will permit two or three ships to be sent, for they think a failure in their engagements at this Juncture must put an end to their residence in that Tamasp Khan accepts crown under the title of Nadir Shah and renews the Company's tomans for enstomB * See Appendix G for list of Rogoms granted by Nadir Shah.49 Kingdom, as Shaw Nadar will be so highly incensed that they cannot hope for any future favour from him.

This circumstance shews tbe impossibility of the Brokers getting money from them to pay off his Debt, hut as they intend to send Mr. 'Whittwell up to Carmenia &amp; the Broker will furnish money for tbe Investment there, his debt at the end of the season will not be very considerable. XLI. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 9 OF 1785-1736. Bombay Castle December 1736. Imported the Wyndham Captain Richard Shuterz from Gombroon by Letter f whom we received a Letter from the Agent &amp; Council dated the 7th instant Gombroon! 11 answering ours of the 23rd September Duplicate of which they received by stateofthetr the Cowan &amp; Robert the 19th November &amp; the Wyndham imported the next ^ arman i a ' day. They advise that they have not since their last received any Complaint from Lettifas Caun about the condition of the Northamberland sold him bv Captain Milne, but if they do or find cause to apprehend that the Company may be put to expence in compromising any dispute about her they will attach the effects left there by Captain Mylne &amp; shou'd anybody offend in that manner hereafter tbey will strictly put our orders in Execution. They have delivered the small freight per Wyndham &amp; taken up the Cittamees &amp; now return the ships with three hundred ninety two bags of Carmenia wool amounting to Sha^ two hundred three thousand one hundred eighty seven &amp; two goz which is unpack'd as for want of large timbers they could not set up their Press, that a further quantity of six thousand maunds was sent out of Carmenia early enough to have arrived at Gombroon in time, but the Beasts bein? all seized to carry provisions to be lodged at proper distances for the King's Army in their March to Candahar no more wool was then come in. They had purchased about fourteen thousand maunds which they think will come under thirty five shahees per maund Clear of all Charges. They say that Seawax tho. a very honest man ought not to be trusted alone in Carmenia as being a Gaber he is liable to be fleeced by the Government who would oblige him to make presents or lend the Company's money on any pretext by which his Expences might be greater than would be occasioned by the Conti nuance of a Company's servant which will be necessary if they send any Woolen goods up there. That the broad Cloth &amp; Perpets now sent them is a very good sortment if it proves agreeable to tbe Musters, but as they have not had time to examine it yet they will send patterns of woolen goods proper for that Market with the necessary remarks to our Hon'ble Masters by the first Overland conveyance after they find how the Merchants like the quantity sent them. That about two months before the date of their advices 2678 F. D.50 one A-a Tarr arrived there as the King's &amp; Beglerbeggy's Merehant &amp; brought a letter desiring the Gentlemen to supply him with a large q^tity of Cloth &amp; perpets but as he proposed no other way of paying for it u y Bills on the Shawbunder, they refused hearkening to any contract with him tho the Duoh &amp; some of the Merchants sold him goods to the amount ot fifteen hundred tomands to be paid in that manner. That they will send up as much Cloth &amp; Perpets to Carmenia as will he sufficient for tha, Marke heinc as they judge about two thousand Tomands worth per annum, but they think it will be better to send it at once than in small Parcells tho. they believe it would be more for the Company's interest to dispose of it all at once at Gombroon provided the money could be got for it in any reasonable time, which is impossible as Copper and Goz are so very scarce that neither the Broker or Merchants would be able to pay for the quantity now sent m those species those two years. Nor could they obtain such prices to be paid in Abasse and Mahmoodies as would be equivalent to the difference of Exchange which is fifty per cent. &amp;they are afraid should the King's Merchant return as expected he will offer to pay them in white money &amp; expect the woolen goods cheaper than they were formerly sold to the Broker, but tho. he may give them trouble upon their refusing the King's Coin at the Current rate they are resolved not to consent. That the new King seems hitherto Nadir shab seems ver y favourably inclined towards our Nation &amp; they hope that now we have towarShe 11101111 ^ sent them so fine a ship as the Cowan to be sold to him, he will without delay ^avfngreoeiveda renew the remaining principal rogoms without expecting any new agreement »hip from them f r0m them or assisting the Muscattees, etc. They have sent the President's *.heir privileges. congratulatory Letter to the New King with another from the agent desiring him to order his officers to take Charge of the Cowan &amp; hoping His Majesty would be pleased to send the remaining rogoms his answer to which will let them see what his real intentions are, for if he does not comply now they have satisfied his desires in every respect they think he never will. That they are again called upon to transport another Embassadour to Scindy one Mirza, Mossein a relation of Sadat Caun the Mogul's Vizier, this service was also required of the Dutch, but they not being able to furnish a ship &amp; our gentlemen thinking it would be imprudent at this critical juncture to disoblige the King &amp; that it might have furnished him with a pretence for delaying the Rogums Ithey consented to let them have the Eobert, tho. they have remonstrated the unreasonableness of being continually obliged to transport Embassadours at a great Expence without ever being paid any thing for it. That when Aga Tarr came to Gombroon he brought with him an obligation given the late Mahumud Ali Caun when Beglerbeggy of Tars, &amp;c., under the Hon'ble Company's seal to pay him one hundred Tomands on his giving a Telligaw to receive our fine proportion of one thousand tomands per annum out of the freight brought on the drake from Bengali but only five hundred tomands being received out of said freight they offered fifty to the relations of said Mahmud Ally Caun, (who was then gone Embassadour to India) which they refused &amp; the said obligation being now in Muhamud Toggy Caun's possession they fear they shall be obliged to pay the whole. That the repairs of the Factory would have been finished if a sufficient quantity of timber had been sent them. They enclose an indent of what is still wanting which however they will endeavour to supply themselves with from the Dutch &amp; advise us in their next. They desire a supply of two writers, there being sufficient of Council for other stations.61 XLIL PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 10 OF 1786-1737. Bombay Castle, 25 February 1736-1737.

They advise that the Jame arrived there the 14th December, and sail'd the next day for Bussorah by whom they acquainted Mr. French that they had adjusted his account with the Agency and as he had for several years been at an expense for Doctor, Reduction of and been four years out of the money he advanced the Mahomed Bashaw to cu8tom8 at get the Customs reduced, they permitted him for the first to charge two thousand cruz, and one per cent, per month on the latter in his next accounts, and to charge his own and Mr. Dorrils Diet and Salary at Ten Shahees to the r upee. That by the Carolina who arrived from Bussorah the 27th December and sail'd the 29th for Surat, they sent the Chief and Factors at Surat a chest of Treasure reced. by her from Mr. French amounting to Sh^ forty five thousand nine hundred and thirty four. That the Richmond Messrs. Sutcliff &amp; Cuittendon from Bengali arrived there the 13th January, and sail'd the 30th for Bussorah, by whom they gave the Hon. Company a full account of their transactions. That on receiving advices from Mr. Savage at Carmania that silver money was at one hundred per cent. Exchange, and desiring that» for part of the cloth they should send him he might be permitted to make returns in Abasses or Mamoodies, they found it wou'd not be proper to send up more woolen goods than he cou'd barter for copper and black Money Sales and pmchases. as it wou'd be impossible for him to raise the price of the goods in any degree proportionable to the difference of the exchange and on old copper there wou'd arise a loss of the Carroy besides the difference of the price which at Carmania was twenty nine Shahees that maund, and none of the Merchants at Gombroon cou'd be prevailed on to purchase except the Broker unless they had sold to the Government who wou'd have obliged them to take silver money at fifty per cent. &amp; at length they agreed to let him have four-fifths of it at the following prices reserving the other fifth to be sent to Carmania to be paid for either in Abasses at five Shahees, or Black Money or old Copper. Half in six months and half in twelve months' time, viz.:— Coarse Cloth ...... Twenty five Shahees per Guz. Fine Drabs and fine Cloth one with another . Sixty three Shal do. And the winter which is the proper season for disposing of the woolen goods, being almost over rendering it necessary to get rid of the large parcel they had on hand as soon as they cou'd and there being again of upwards of Forty five thousand rupees on the sale they hope we will approve hereof They say the large balance due from him on close of their last books is considerably reduced by his advancing Money for the Investment of Woo]. Fine Medleys Coarse and Middling Medleys Perpets . . . . . Seventy five Shal do. . Forty five Sha^. do. . Two hundred twenty five Shai per Guz.52 A Russian factory reported to have been established at Astrakan. .Nadir iShah assures the English of his protection, and {(leased at our etting him have a ship. Nadir Shah expects the English to assist the Persians against the Maskateers. and they hope to remit us the whole amount of the parcel of Woolen Goods now sold a? the same becomes due. That Mr. Savage advises them some Georgians were arrived at Carmania with some cloth from Spahaun that come by the way of Astracan where some Russia Merchants have lately established a Factory with the design to supply the Persian Market with all sorts of Woolen Goods, he adds that the Carmania Market would not take off above one thousand or Twelve hundred Tomands worth that season (which is less than they had reserv'd for it) and what is and may be imported from Muscovy would then and always affect the price of that article. They enclose Shaw Nadir's answer to the President's letter, and the Agent has rece'd several from him, wherein he makes assurances of his favour and protection, and extremely pleas'd at our letting him have a ship, and says when the Beglerbeggy comes. Affairs will be finish'd to our satisfaction, but he desires the Agent to listen to his proposals, from whence the gentlemen seem to think he wants their assistance to his Pieet and Forces daily expected at Gombroon, to go against the Muscatters but should that be the case they will duly regard our orders for refusing them. That the Agent's ill-state of health having obliged him to leave Gombroon the two last seasons he had been to a considerable Expence for travelling charge, etc., while he was absent and as some of the other gentlemen were with him and the disbursement of the Factory during that time lessened thereby they had consented to his charging forty eight thousand four hundred and fifty six Shahees and four Goz to the Hon'ble Company's account which they hope we will approve assuring us that it cost him considerably more. That Mr. Cockell takes passage on the Robert leaving the charge of the Agency to Mr. Gechie agreeable to our orders. They send on the Robert the soldiers taken of the Rose and enclose a list of necessaries for the use of the President's Table amounting to Shahees Fourteen hundred fifty one and two Goz. XLIII. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 10 OF 1736-1737. Bombay Castle, May 1787. Imported the Robert Captain Walter grant from Gombroon by whom we received a letter from John Geekie, Esq., Agent, etc., &amp; Council there dated the 26th April, owing the receipt of ours of the 13*i March and advising that the James called in there from Bussora the 19th of February sailed the 21st for Surat. A French ship called the Herene commanded by MonsL Beaumont arrived there from Bengali the 11th March who sent his boat ashore to complain of Mr. Boisroll and treatment last year, and desiring to know how he should be received. The Beglerbeggy sent a messenger on board with many fair promise on which the Frenchman went ashore, but he had not been paid the Money stopt last year from Boisroll and, which they design to allow him out of the Customs (of four and a half per cent.) he had agreed to pay on his cargo ; of which he had then sold but little. Two Dutch ships were arrived from Batavia, and one that came last year returned thither.@ 53 Our Hon ble Masters ship Pelham arrived the 31st March, on whom came Mr. Peacock to receive the goods left there by Captain Milne and himself the year before, which before the rece't of our orders they had permitted him to ship off ; for tho' the Persians think the Northumberland a dear Bargain they had not given the gentleman any reason to apprehend they expect any satisfaction from the Hon'ble Company, and as the goods were perishable they had declared the protests given last year still continued in full force, they hope their permitting the goods to be shipt off will not be esteemed any Ban to the Hon'ble Company's receiving what damages may hereafter accrue. F er8i ^ e f pe ? itioQ mi -p, n , i -i ^ t 0 assist the Imam J-lie l ersians neet under the Command of Ijetiffah Caun having on board ^ man against about five thousand men and fifteen hundred horse sailed the 1st April for subjects, Corjukhoon lying about half way between Gombroon and Muscat. It is given out that this force is sent at the Imaum's request to reduce his rebell subjects to his obedience tho' it is thought if they find it practicable they will make themselves masters of that Port bring the Imaum under subjection to the King of Persia. Our gentlemen were not called upon for their assist ance in this expedition, but the Beglerbeggy was so pressing with the Dutch that they thought proper to lend one of their ships. The advice mentioned in their last that a parcel of cloth was brought to Carmania by way of Astracan is confirmed, and if this new trade increases it must cause a WoolleQ cloth rivalship between our Hon'ble Masters and them who shall sell cheapest byw^of Per8Ia They have not advice that the parcel of Woolen goods they sent up in Pebruary A8trakaa • was arrived in Carmnnia, which delay they think is occasioned by the Chanwardars Beats being seized to carry provisions and necessarys to the camp before Candahar. The French have this year brought some Broad Cloth which they sold cheap ; and the Broker being apprehensive he cannot possibly get off the cloth and perpets lying by him before a ship may arrive from hence he hopes, we will not send a farther parcel till he has cleard his ware house. They have one hundred ninety seven loads of wool in the house and few more on the road, but great numbers of their beasts being been seized for the Kings service they are obliged to advance money for hiring others to bring down the wool they hope to be able to purchase only the Red wool within the limited price, as the Dutch have this season given the like orders with us; tho' Mr. Savage advises them four or five foreign Merchants were come to purchase that commodity, being as they judge for the Aleppo Market. The King having beat the Ophgoons they had retired into the Castle, and he was then besieging then in Candahar. That the Beglerbeggy arrived at Gombroon the 13th February having given many fair promises that nobody should be oppressed or molested which however he very ill kept notwithstand- The ing the presents made him by all ranks upon his arrival; They deferr'd doing Beglerbeggy so till they found they should highly disoblige him, and create a certain Gombroon, impediment to passing the Eogums if they longer delay'd, and considering ^ 0 C eptag O to ^ogum,, the rank and power they gave him as little as possible which was one hundred and fifty tomands; They advise that he has since renew'd all the remaining Bogums except that for the one thousand tomands out of the customs which he told them they must not except as the same was not consistent with the King's dignity, and we were amply rewarded for former services and the utmost they could bring him to grant with all their arguments and persua sions was a Rogum for one third part of the Customs on the freight brought by our own ships, wherein they got inserted that at such times they shall have a person in the Custom house and the Merchants who took freight on cur54. ships be civilly and justly treated. These being the terms they could get after four years continual solicitation they hope we will approve their accept' ing them, as tbeir business which since the late revolution has been so uncertain will be carried on without interruption and the present king being so fast on the throne as in all probability to leave it quietly to the posterity the Hon'ble Company they say may enjoy the priviledges for many years. The Beglerbeggy is very solicitous to have the sum he is to receive on the Rogum being confirmed paid him in band, but they are determined not to part with so much money till they are in possession of them, they say the Beglerbeggy is resolved to continue at Gombroon till he hears what success Lettifah Caun meets with and that he talks of spending some time at Asseen on the approach of the Hot weather, where they can do no otherwise then entertain him in an handsome manner for two or three days tho' it will occasion a further expence to the Hon'ble Company. That the Beglerbeggy desiring them to give him a bill on Carmania for two hundred Tomands silve^ which they endeavoured to evade complying with. He thereupon gave them to understand they must not expect the liberty of bringins anything from thence but Wool and has given the Shawbunder an order to detain any copper, Black Money or anything else they may bring from Carmania except wool, alledging that if we did not bring those articles other merchants wou'd and pay a large duty on them; That formerly we brought down nothing but Chegums and silver which we might still continue to do, but the gentlemen observe that the extravagent exchange between those species and Black Money would render it to no purpose to send up Cloth without liberty of making the returns in Copper. They have therefore Consented to give him a Bill for two hundred tomands which they are to receive of the chief Banian at Gombroon, in hopes he will recall his orders to the Shawbunder tho' they fear he will not drop this affair without a present, and should not that prevail on him they desire our orders relating hereto. They hafo News that lulphar and theShaiks along that Coast have submitted to Letifah Caun, the Beglerbeggy was gathering more forces, the Dutch having promised him their large ship for a transport he had hinted as if he intended to go over himself, and that we should carry him which, if true, wou'd occasion a great deal of trouble. I Letter from Gombroon. Rising of the Arabs in the Persian Marine Service under Sheikh Abdullah and Sheikh Bama. XLIV. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 4 OF 1740-1741. Bombay Castle, Pebeuaey 1740-1741. By this vessel received a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon of the 10th December last which was prepared on notice of the Pame's in tended departure from Bussorah and designed by one of their Trankeys to have intercepted her in her passage down the Gulph. They inform us that on the 26^ August news was brought that the Arabs in the Persian Marine Service had risen upon the Persians whom they killed with their Admiral Mir Ally Cawn, and carried away the whole Fleet consisting off three ships, a Grab and a Brigantine which were afterwards divided &amp; placed under the respec tive commands of Abdull Shaik and Shaik Rama Arabs of different Casts. Whereupon the Dutch having two ships of about twenty guns each in the Port the Government prevailed upon them to go in quest of these Rebells A- u55 who accordingly fell in with Abdulla Shaik's squadron, and on their firing at them the Arabs run the Grab in Shoal Water which the Dutch might car-^ith^hips, but 8 to tainly have retaken. But instead of that they drove by her with the tide and Q0 P^po**- returned the 13!r September from this shamefull enterprize, without having effected anything for the Persian Service. At which time was arrived at Gom broon the new Admiral ordered from Shawoon Shan to assume the command of t he Pleet who brought the gentlemen a letter from the late Beglerbeggy wherein he recommended him the Derreah Beggy to their favour and added that His Majesty wanted us to provide him another ship in the same manner the Cowan was &amp; that they would keep vessels constantly in the Gulph for his service according to agreement. For the first the Admiral who had never seen a Ship or the sea in bis life was very pressing for them to effect immediately and made several other propositions of the like easy nature, which were all evaded by their referring him to the Dutch for Ships and lending him their salute guns with t heir gunner and Coffree Soldiers for the Equipment of a Small Ketch he had lying there and on which he obliged them to hoist our Colours. The 23rd September this Ketch joined by two Dutch Ships a small Grab and about Twenty Trankeys, under the Command of the New Admiral sailed on an expedition against the Arabs with whom they had a small Skirmish at which the Admiral was so terrified that he returned again the 12^ October without having done anything, being pursued as far as Cong by the Eebells. These fruitless attempts have so dissatisfied the Persians that they have The English aid . n it ± ^ £ demanded. now turned their expectations on us &amp; even say that the very appearance ot our Grabs would intimidate them to a surrender. The Surdar or General of the Hot Countries will by no means suffer the Dutch to send away their Ships altho' they have fed him very handsomely with presents. He has also much insisted on the Pames being ordered from Bussorah in order to compose another Fleet for himself to go in and chastize these people. Affairs being thus in this perplexed situation the Gentlemen desire we will give them the requisite Instructions for their Government. Especially as it is apprehended His Majesty will issue some strange and severe orders on this accident reaching his knowledge &amp; hereupon desire we would re-establish their former garrison with an officer in lieu of the sepoys, who are useless. The Arabs who were at first divided have since reunited and the Imaum of Muscatt was preparing to join them but they are as averse to trusting him as they were the Persians and it is reported their Designs was to seize an Island in the Gulph and consti tute themselves a state Independent of him. Erom whence they intend to plun der Gombroon. Shaw Nadir has subdued that part of Tartary which bordered on Persia and taken their Cham or King Prisoner. Many strange alterations are threatened to be introduced on his return from thence, such as shaving his sub jects beards and, changing their habit to that of the Turks. His aversion &amp; revenge still continue against Shaw Abbas's Race. It is said the late Begler beggy has so far merited his favour as to become his Ahtamadoulet and have the Liberty of setting in a Gold Chair of State according to the new mode. Notwith- standing the many troubles throughout this kingdom which might naturally be presumed to have put a stop to trade, the Gentlemen assure us the demands for Woollen Goods still continues owing in some measure to the Caravans from Alleppo to Bussorah, being forbid their intercourse at which Port Mr. Dorrill likewise advised them a small parcel may be disposed of to advantage. The want therefore of this commodity put His Majesty upon the Expedient of supplying his army with coats and caps wrought of Carmenia Wool, which somuch inhanced the price of that article as rendered it impracticable for M 4 Savage to purchase any within a tolerable reach of the limitation, Advices from England in May mention the equipment of a Portugueze Fleet for these parts. The death of their Surgeon Mr. Rose occasions the request of another as useful in his stead. The Persians fra a n tl En a S t 8h ted ^ tlle Same tim6 Came to lian(1 ailotllier of the of last month with a ship taking a^pass Postscript of the 13^. They own the receipt of our letters of the 12th JNTov- MaskaTand at the em ^ er &amp; 14^ December last and esteem our precautions in regard to the reitefto n hfm Sli8h Ellttee ^oulett Grab highly necessary to be continued. The Sardar having heard the English ships had taken the Jmaum of Muscatts Pass was greatlv enraged &amp; asked the Agent whether we thought the friendship of such an in considerable Person more eligible than that of his master's ? As he was greatly dissatisfied with the fruitless proceedings of the Dutch, he urged many rea sons for our assisting them against the Rebells and said that we must look upon the ships thus run away with as taken from ourselves, who ought to be accounted for every thing that passes in the Gulph according to former agree- ments, &amp; more especially now as we had no alliances to infringe, or friends to quarrell with but a parcel of weak inconsiderable wretches, whose mention he was almost ashamed to use in Discourse of two such mightly Kings, as ours &amp; his. The King has sent positive orders for the Europeans to assist all in The King's demand their power, which the Sardar said could be only done through us providinu th em With ships hy way of sale for the present, the payment whereof he made tb e Arabs. no scrapie to promise on Delivery. But on a difficulty heing offered to this proposition he added that we must then aid him with our Fleet, TTpon a disagreement of two Shaiks who put themselves at the head of the Revolted Arahs, a Ship and Grab were delivered to the Imaum of Muscat, which hav« increased his Fleet (a growing nuisance) to nine Top sail Vessels. The Dutch having been taken notice of by the King for being so extremely ready to help the reduction of the Arabs &amp; particularly distinguished by the Sardar, Thev do not stick to say that there is a ship now on her passage purely for Bis Majesty's Service &amp; that they have waited thus long inactive to be joined by our Ships which when the King had no occasion for were always in the Gulph, but now had deserted him. The Treatment our Gentlemen 'have met with of late at Gombroon has left them no room of Complaint, as the disposi tion of the Government seems to be much changed, and the good of the subject more considered than before. The King was returned from Tartary at Arreck where he has ordered a general meeting of his Games, whose accounts were to be taken and beheaviour examined into during his absence and the late Beglerbeggy still continues in great favour with him. The demands for Wool len goods as yet remain large, but the means of their Transport they leave to us, altho' they think it would be better secured in a defensible Vessel which should also serve to bring back their returns in moneys. They enclose State of the Eesident's (at Bussorah) charges and appointments, by which the latt appears deficient of the former. Thirteen Thousand Eighty Eight (13 0881 mamoodies, besides an unavoidable Expense, He must be at in Horses Furni ture, Be. On assuming the Post, which the advantage of the Customs collected there of late does not requite &amp; his place otherwise giving him no Superior- ity in Trade above a private merchant makes the preeminence very eostlv and not to be born without loss. They have detained Gattivat Detachml and in its stead returned the seapoys. Their Postscript of the 13$ was oocasior.ed by a message the Surdar had sent them Importing that he had certain »dvioe67 of the commander of the Shawallum's being on the point of selling his ship to the Imaum of Muscat, but bad not done it through some Disagreement on the terms. This imprudent step has prodigiously inflamed him with a suspicion of our veracity &amp; instilled such a notion of jealousy in him, that the gentle men were apprehensive some expense will attend their making it up to his satisfaction, altho' as far as such a palpable Circumstance of Truth would admit, they endeavoured to persuade him of the unreasonableness of said re port. They desire therefore our strict prohibition to the owners of all Ships that come in that Gulph to avoid the like disputes in future. The Surdar has desired them to encourage all ships from Bussorah &amp; other places to touch at Gombroon in their passage upon his assurance of their being unmolested, In hope this complaisant behaviour will avail on us to comply with his other demands. / ■ .: ' : ' XLV. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 17. Bombay Castle, March 8th, 1744. Arrived the Nancy Grab Duncan Watson Master from Gombroon. That Gombroon, Letter vessel brought us a Letter from the Agent and Council dated the 29th January hoiD ' owing recet. of ours of the 15th April &amp; 11th October by the Resolution with the woolen goods consigned them. The greatest part of the Woolen Goods sent to Spahaum 8f Carmenia had been disposed of &amp; the resettling at the former place had been attended with the good effect of putting an entire stop to the Russia Traders in those parts, who had not since been able to make Resettling at any sales, &amp; Our Gentlemen had thoughts of settling at Mushat as what sold Ispalian ,! nd ,, . „ . , . v proposal to settle there is cnieny carried into Corasoon, &amp; the Russia traders can have recourse at Mast iat. stop nowhere else for sale of their cloth &amp; consequently will have but little Measnrertakento encouragement to carry on their scheme. As the Gentlen. at Spahaun could fo^niandberg not content the customers by a present in lieu of the Customs, they W ere free of dllties • 0 obliged to risque an application to Court for the rogoms wanted for our inland trade being free of dutys, which only produced a letter from the Secretary of State to drop the demand for the present. They had since given them a lafctitude to go to the expence of seven or eight hundred tomands, if they could be procured for that sum; &amp; the Secretary had given them assurance their business should be done, but should it fail a publick application must be made to his Majesty, the expence of which will be about thirty thousand rupees. The troubles in the country had prevented their getting in any part of the account sales (which came enclosed) &amp; now became due, but on the whole of the sales there would be upwards of thirty per cent, gains. They shall watch a proper opportunity to bring, if possible, the method observed here in all sales, into practice there; but while they have in view the getting off a large quantity of Cloth, &amp; to oppose a party set up in opposition to them, it will be a difficult matter to break through what has been the Custom of the Country for many years, but they should not have given the large Credit they have, had there been a prospect of getting off the Cloth any other way. The woolen goods for Bussorah were sent thither by the first Conveyance that could take them in, &amp; they shall take every opportunity of supplying them according to their advices. The agent was ready to make good the amount of the wine we rejected &amp; only wanted to know whether an equal valuable quantity of goods will be acceptable. They were daily receiving the amount of Seawaxes Debt 25 V 8 F. l&gt;.58 Seiga of Basrah, raised by order of Nadir Shah. Mr, Dorill, the Agent trying to remain neutral is ill-treated by the Turks and proposeg to leave Basrah. Orders to him. Charges for repairing Gom' broon factory. Relief of the military at Gom broon. The Carmania factory. in money wool &amp; copper and had it not been for troubles in the Country, ere now the whole would have been received. The wool in the warehouse amounts to Four thousand six hundred and fifty maunds &amp; stands at under twenty- eight Sha: per Maund clear of all charges. They enclose Musters of three sorts of raw silk that are carried into Europe &amp; shall order a small parcel to be brought agreeable to the Hon'ble Company's Orders. The Persians laid siege to Bussorah with twelve thousand men which continued from the 28th of August to the 27th November when it was raised by Shaw Nadir's orders &amp; the Army with their artillery marched away the 6th of December. Mr. Dorill at the beginning of the troubles took what precaution he could not to have any vessels there that might assist either party &amp; accordingly sent away a small brigantine of his own, but the lascars who were Bussorah people obliged the commander to return and being determined they should not be of any assistance, he was ordered prisoner and confined to a tent upon the walls two days, when from the people's insinuations to the Janaizarees of his being in the Persian interest and fearing a general massacre of the Europeans he was obliged to comply but at the same time ordered the Commander to bore holes in her bottom &amp; make her in such a condition that if not immediately run ashore she must sink, which the Turks seeing permitted her to be brought on shore &amp; Mr. Dorill was then released. But the insolence he had met with from the Mussoleem even before this dispute was such that if passed without obtaining justice from the Bashaw, it will be impossible to remain without continual affronts whenever he refuses to advance loans. Therefore when the publick &amp; private concerns are wound up, he proposed retiring on board ship remon strating the grievancies, which if not redressed to leave the j place. But as it will be some time before all private Concerns can be got in &amp; might be of ill consequence to the private trade, they had referred him to the orders sent from hence under the 15th April 1738, until they receive our further directions. That the charges repairing Gombroon Eactory on close of last books amounted to Shahees five hundred thirteen thousand three hundred eighteen and three goz &amp; to finish it they judge will be wanting ten or twelve thousand rupees more. Ensign James Mackenzil died the 19th November intestate &amp; his Effects had been sold at outcry. Mr. Savage would remain at Carmenia to settle some private affairs till after the winter when they propose sending him to settle a Factory at Maushat &amp; request two assistants more may be sent. That the Military having been there upwards of two years request to be relieved &amp; till the present commotions are settled they think it will be proper to have an Ensigns Command. In a Postcript they advise the return of Mr. Pack from Carmenia having left Mr. Savage .in Charge of that Factory &amp; he informs them the greatest part of the Woolen Goods sent thither in March &amp; July last were disposed of, the particular accounts of which were dispatched by shotters the day he left that place. Gombroon advices &amp; Orders thereon. XLVI. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 17. Bombay Castle, 3ed April 1744. Perusing the last advices from Gombroon the following remarks and Orders were passed :— From the success that has attended and from the desire of our Hon'ble Masters to extend the vend of their Woolen Goods59 we doubt not but they will approve theiv settling at jfrfushcit likewise as from Settling a factory their advises it may be a means of frustrating the Russia Traders' scheme wo'? and we think Mr. Savage a proper person to be employed on that Design. Accepting of bills on Madrass or any other place in part of their Sales may be attended with very ill consequences unless the drawer gives sufficient security for answering the sum with Interest on any default; It is the more necessary to give them this caution from what they write of the last drawer of a bill payable at Surat having withdrawn, so that they could not obtain satisfaction for interest &amp; the difference of time it was Actually payable in interest of what the drawer assured them and at last was paid only by transfer. If the agent will send good Wine in lieu of what was rejected it will be accepted. The orders given Mr. Dorril are conformable to those of the Presidency, Orders to Mr. and if he can remain at Bussorah with submitting only to a small expence, Dori11 approTea - We are of opinion it will be preferable to withdrawing from thence. That to relieve their Military It is agreed we send a Serjeant drummer Relief of the and twelve topasses as a common Watch, but cannot see any occasion for an at G(m) * Ensigns Command at that Factory. XLVII. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 17. Bom bat Castle, April 20th, 1744. In the Evening imported the Jenny Captain Leonard Mr. Cristophev G(lmbrooI1 , Cradock Super Cargoe from Gombroon. from. By her received Letter from the Agent and Council dated the 2nd Confadon in tho Instant and advises that the confusion in the Countrv on revolt of Toekev uti c ' ,lntr y o n a™' 1 ' 1 ' i i? i.-i -i i j. ^ -it revolt of Tockey as also some or the bead tribes m Corrasoon and Sharrdoom had put a stop to Khan - Bad debts. all business and prevented their getting in any part of the cloth money, but as it is now said the King had made a truce with the Turks, &amp; Toggy Caun was surrounded at Shyrash whom they expect soon to hear has surrendered it may be hoped things will be quiet. But his revolt is likely to cause a bad Debt to Our Hon'ble Masters due from the Calentar of Shyrash of four hundred Tomands and another of five hundred &amp; seventy (570) from the Government tho. for the former Mr. Savage had taken an obligation from three Persons to pay half in Money and half in Grain in five months, and for the latter two Banians past notes. But the Calentar being taken up, his eyes put out and effects seized on suspicion of being concerned with Toggy Caun, the Banjans refused payment alledging they were forced by the Calentar to pass their note which obliged Mr. Savage to apply to the Government and had some hopes of recovering it out of the Callentars effects but should he sacceed it will be attended with some expence. They had procured the merchants Notes for the cloth Lead and rice, they let the Beglerberggy have, for which he gave assignments on His Naib, but as it is on account Customs due from those merchants, it may hereafter be disputed as not having the King's authority to pay his money for what Toggy Caun had taken. They had received from Carmenia the greatest part of Seawaxes last Balance and Mr. Savage would remit what he had got in of his sales as soon as the roads were safe they enclose two Bills of Exchange one for fourteen thousand60 eight hundred (14,800) Eupees the other for six thousand (6,000) rupees drawn on one Sultan David at Madrass as also an Invoice of Treasure laden on the Jenny and had permitted Mr. Grendon to return on that ship for the recovery of his health. By the last advices from Spahaun they find it will be impossible to send more goods up country till a renewal of their privileges are obtained, for the customers there had procured an Order for the payment of customs on what sent last year, which with diffi culty was staved off by the help of a present to the Governour this with the troubles every where in the Country had induced them to put off their design of sending a parcel of cloth to Corrasoon, or indeed any where else till the times are more settled and they see what turn the King's affairs are likely to take. They had lately received from Hamadoon a rogom from the King sent by one Meer Ally Sultan directing them to assist in seizing Mahmud Toggy Oaun, which was accompanyed with a Letter from the Sardar at Shyrash to seize the Governour &amp; Shawbunder and advising his having sent Meer Ally Sultan and some forces but to do nothing without their advice. The Dutch receiving a rogom and letter to the same purport immediately sent to Meer Ally to come with his forces and he entered the town the 27th at night with the King's Ohoppars, but instead of having the King's Orders to seize the Gover nour and Shawbunder they brought rogoms confirming them in their Posts the Shawbunder went out to receive his but the Governour not going for sometime they sent about forty people to attack his house, when the Dutch began firing on his House and Eort, and our Gentlemen finding the Dutch design was not to deliver him the King's rogom but seize him according to the Sardars which they had an equal to do they sent to him and he delivered him self up to them the agent has wrote the Sardar that as they would not deliver him the King's room they had seized him according to his Commands. In a Postcript they advise their having sold Mr. Craddock some Dates and enclosed his Bill for the amount being rupees two thousand one hundred and forty one two quarters and ten reas (2,141-2-10). XLVIIL PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 17. Imported the Sallamander Ketch William Browne Master from Gombroon. Gombroon, Letter jjy ^ rece iy e( i a Letter from the agent and Council dated the 22nd July acknowledging receipt of our's by the Nancy Grab with a Packet enclosed for the Hon'ble Court of Directors which was forwarded to Bussorah the 19th June. That having received a Duplicated Letter from Messrs. Dorril and Graves advising a warr being declared between England and France to give us early Slandand notice thereof they had got the Commander of the Salamand to proceed with France. Persian these advices and enclosed copy of his Majesty's Declaration. The Prench at demand for cnstoms w o * at Ispahan. Bussorah had no advices of the warr, nor at Aleppo when the Messengers came from thence. That they had frequently urged the necessity of putting the Hon'ble Company's affairs on some footing with the Government to pre vent a stop being put to their affairs, as there were demands for arrears of Customs and in their last mentioned an order which the Custom matters at Spahaun had obtained for paying Customs on Goods sent there last year and which Mr. Pierson with difficulty and a present to the Governour staved off but they on a second application procured an order for the English and Dutch61 to pay the inland dutys and the account to be made up for five years past which gave the Resident great trouble, no less than three thousands tomands. thro, the Governours being brought over to the other parties interest not withstanding the King's Orders were to take what was actually due (which would not have amounted to two hundred Tomands) and in future to take the same customs from the Europeans as other Merchants. They add that if some measures are not taken to prevent it, they may except the same where ever the Hon ble Company have* carried on any trade from what has thus happened. They have taken some steps for getting redress, but from the precarious accounts they have of the King's circumstances, it would be proper to wait till some judgment can be made of the turn affairs will take before they go to any expence. Eor the present they had directed Mr. Pierson to. petition the King in the Agent's name which they believe will be a means of getting restitution for what more they had taken, than they had a right to. They particularly urge the necessity of obtaining a confirmation of their privi- ledges and on a supposition, we shall not be against what is so absolutely necessary, they enclose a list of goods proper for presents, which, if they should not have occasion for, they can always sell to advantage. That the troubles had prevented their getting in the Cloth money, but they had taken as security to the amot. of nine hundred fifty tomands in goods and were about getting in the remainder, when Choppas arrived to levy four thousand tomands on the merchants of that place which was executed with that severity, that few escaped the country discipline. Theirs and the Dutch Brokers proportion came to upwards of six thousand Rupees which not having immediately ready they shared the same fate as others. Tockey Caun after a long resistance in Tockey Khan ghyrash against thirty thousand men, made his escape from thenoe but was takeD - afterwards taken in a shepherd's dress, and they hear the King had ordered the punishment of him, and his accomplices according to t heir deserts. The City of Shyrash had severely suffered on his account, no less than twelve thousand men having been cut off and their wo men and children given to the soldiers. The report of Seffe Mirzas had entered the Kingdom with a Turkish War between ihe Army was daily more and more confirmed. The King was collecting his troops j-rom all parts and by what they learn the Turks were advanced to meet him, defeat, they had a report, he was beaten by Suffe Mirz a between Tabreez and Casbin, but do not give Credit to it, certain it is his defeat is wished for and expected by every body and it is the general opinion his soldiers will go over to the other party when he engages should there be such a person a Suffe Mirza in the Turkish Army. From the uncertainty of the times they do not think it proper to return any of their Military and desire an Ensign and two or Detention of the three Europeans for Coprorals may be sent as also their indent of stores at Gom ' complied with being in great want. That the agent had a parcel of wine on the road just before the troubles commenced, but not being yet come in, he supposes it has been carried off by the soldiers, in that case he shall comply with our orders in regard to the wine formerly rejected. XLIX. Extract from a letter addressed ly the Chief and Council at Gombroon, to the Bombay Govern ment, dated the 10^ April 1746. As your Honor in Council were pleased to judge Mif Grendon a proper Grendon succeeds person to succeed to the Residency of Bussorah, we accordingly sent him there Don11 at Ba8ral1 ' 2578 P. D.62 on the Rose, and by the last advices from thence we expect Mr. DorriU in a short time, who was taken up in settling his affairs. Our last letters from up Country advise of Shaw Nadir's return from Callat and that he had appointed all his Governors to meet him at Tehraun, a place about ten days from Ispahan, from whence he intended to go against the Turks with an Army of Two hundred thousand men. During bis stay at Ispahan he treated our Resident Nadir stab calls as Civil as could be expected from the tyrannical disposition he was in, the time be was there, but we believe it was owing to the help of a present amounting to Jetption of?nr tiTil Shahees 70.169-9 which could not be avoided without running the risk ot his resentment.

They are apprehensive that the 6,000 weight of Carmenia Wool indented for cannot he procured, as from the oppression of the Government the people are obliged to sell their goats in the market to raise money for their tax &amp; the village circumjacent had been plundered &amp; their goats destroyed. However they shall recommend to M' Graves to procure the quantity last ordered exclusive of former indents. Nadir Shaw was then at Carmenia in his way to Sistoon which place had revolted. He had been at Spahaun where he had used the people with great cruelty in order to extort m'oney from them, to carry with him to his castle where he says he intends to stay to resthimself &amp; some think he intends to put one of his sons or grandson upon the Throne. While the King was in his camp at Spahaun he Wanted an European Doctor and sent a Eogam to the Rogom obtained Agent to procure one for him &amp; upon their being informed that a capable man exempting English or about Spahaun they had ordered the Resident to get him for that eo 0 untry r duties P service and the Linguist while at the Camp had procured a Rogam freeing the ' English of the Up Country Dutys, which they say was well worded.

M.r Grendon at Bussorah had sold thirty Bales of cloth to an Armenian for four months' time, who being a very trusty &amp; Wealthy man he hopes it will be approved especially as there was no other way to dispose of that article.

Interest and likewise our Reason for ordering the Agent and Council at Gombroon not to discharge that Bill otherwise than at the Legal interest of the Country nor to accept any other which might be drawn by those Gentlemen. But by the Sphaun Books received since we wrote them last, we find exclusive of the Bill above- mentioned Messrs. Pierson and Blandy had taken up several sums of Money amounting to Rs. 14,300 for which they gave bonds some at 10 others at 15 per cent, per mensem and which is the money mentioned by the Agent and Council in their letter to your honours of the 1st July 1747, that the Gentle men at Sphaun were obliged to take up an exorbitant Premium, tho' no mention is made or at what rate, and we llnd upon comparing those books with their diary, and those gentlemen have been studiously fallacious in their accounts which with several gross irregularities we have now pointed out to your Agent and Council for them to enquire into, but as they are likewise very culpable, as well in passing by such neglects as for not having been more fully in their advices to your honours abovementioned the want of which was most probably occasioned your honours to give them the lattitude you did, in your Commands to that Agency per ship Oxford, we have therefore by this first opportunity duly censured them for the same.

Beperused the advices from the Agent and Council at Gombroon dated Gombroon, Advices the 9th October, 10th November and 8th December last, which being now taken fr0m ' reperused • into consideration the Board came to the following resolutions thereon. Resolutions thereon. The Company having been pleased to order a provision of fifty thousand pounds weight of Carmenia Wool, as much of it red as may be procurable, and as cheep as possible, without any limitation as to price which we noticed to the Agent and Council per Boscaiven notwithstanding they seem Gombroon Agent &lt;fc to be in some doubt concerning the purchase of this article, it is therefore ^ p^a^of for ^ directed that the same be again repeated to them in our next advices. Carmenia Wool again repeated to In regard to the Agent and Councils desiring to know the produce in our them - Mint of the different species of money from Persia it is observed that they surely cannot be ignorant that in all Mints regard is only had to weight and fines. However it is agreed that we send them by the next conveyance a List Gombroon, a List of of sundry Gold and Silver coins as they produce in our Mint, and that thev be the , P ,odu « e of Gol d , . -i ji j y-, i-i • • . and Silver coins in advised that trold in comparison with Silver, rises and falls, but that they may our Min t. to be sent in general receive it as paid List, when it will answer as well as Silver. There being a vacancy at our Board and Mr. Danvers Graves the next in Graves Danvers, standing it is agreed that he be admitted thereto, and that the Agent and Council A g e nt at Ispahan, to , _ _ , i i proceed to the be directed to send him hither by the first conveyance for that purpose. And Presidy^ to take if the circumstances of their affairs at Spahaun absolutely requires a Covenant and 8edt in&lt; '' UECl1 Servant to continue there some time longer, Mr. Dalrimple must be appointed hL^ 6810 to relieve Mr. Graves till such time as he can be recalled, for we would have no SSfXiw require Covenant Servant reside there any longer than the necessity of those ill con- it - ducted affairs may unavoidably require. The Agent and Council write us that they had paid Mr. John Hope thirty Gombroon-the Rupees for his passage as was usual for a writer, but. as he was one of their p' s 0 8 ^ 0 0 f r G h 0 e v t Council he ought to have received the customary allowance of fiftv Rupees; s T ervant6 bet weln T -i n ,i . . that Agency and for altho we disapproved or the:r paying Lieutenant Levick, a Military tlle Presidy, to be Officer, more than thirty Rupees, yet it was strangely straining the point in 'snaUoo'liog td them to understand it as relating to the Covenant Servi' in general, whose fSlfr!John'So^ allowances in such cases are to continue on the usual footing, they must there- Se g ^ moeny fore be advised that the sum of fifty Bupees has been made good to Mr. Hop;;70 for his passage he having declared to ns that their steward omitted to y)ay him anything on that account and for which they must give this Presidl credit. In cur consultation of the 16th Jan J last it was agreed to return Mr. John Pierson to Spahaun for the reasons therein particularly set forth that Ilon'ble Bkndy'* affairs. Company have since heen pleased in their commands dated the 30th August last to dismiss him from their service and to order him home by one of the first ships; hut as there appears to us from the Persia advices as likewise from other circumstances sufficient reason to suspect that they have been notoriously injured by his management it is agreed that we adhere to our former resolution for returning him thither, and that the Agent and Council be advised this Board will expect from them a clear and distinct statement article by article of every Item whereby the Company sustain a .Loss, with the amount theieof and their reasons annexed to each and also that they be very carefull, impartial and explicit in this Affair as they value the Hr Company's service after which Mr. Person is to be returned hither by the first conveyance and such effects as he may have in Persia must be secured and sent hither with him. It is observed that the greatest part of the Spahaun creditors of whom Messrs. Peirson and Elandy took up money at such exorbitant rates of interest and exchange, to answer the Bill extorted from Mr. Graves at Carmenia have been paid off within a small sum, with money taken up partly by Mr. Peirson and partly by Mr. Graves by the Agent and Council's permission, altho* they have since thought proper to refuse payment of the Bills they drew in consequence thereof by all which from first to last, that extorted Carmenia Bill of twenty-two thousand Rupees does not stand the Company in much less than one hundred thousand. The Agent and Council well know our Orders were positive for nat paying any more money on that account than was actually received by Messrs. Pierson and Blandy with a legal or reason able interest for the time the creditors had been out of their money, nor does, in our opinions, the Company's Commands to them p. Orford altogether warrant their proceedings therein. It is further observed that as soon as we became fully acquainted with the nature of Messrs. Peirson and Blandy's transactions in this affair we duly represented the same to the H?r Company by the first opportunity that offer'd which advices we do not find they had received when they wrote us last as before mentioned. But as they must have reached them before their dispatch of the Ilchester it is not doubted but the Agent and Council will receive immediately from them by that ship, if yet before particular orders for their guidance therein. It will, therefore, be only further necessary for us now to observe to them that we cannot sufficiently admire at their refusing payment of such Bills as Mr. Graves was obliged to draw on them for his necessary expenses which they were directed by us to allow him, and for no better reason than because we forbid them answering Mr. Peirson's exorbitant Drafts. Gombroon Agent In respect to what the Agent and Council wrote the Chief and Factors Mqnaini tbat in S ura t under the 14th January last concerning the Persian Mahomed Beg, ^P^to^Maboin^^ will be necessary to advise them, that long before the Chief and Pactors Factors at Surat received those advices the GovL of Surat had plundered him of his effects much'as'iay in and given him other ill usage and would likewise have seized a Ship he had, their power. bought, as he says, for ninety one thousand Bupees, had we not upon his application used such measures in their favour as were consistent in a place71 where we have no other authority or power than to maintain the H° Com pany's privileges agreeable to our Phirmaund, however, that at his request we caused his ship to be towed hither, as he had no main mast, few people and is now in want of all kinds of stores. In consequence of what the Agent sometime since wrote the President, of its being Moolah Ally Shaw, the Persian Admirals advice, to detain what money was owing the Persians here for goods they sold out of the two ships that came to his Port in April 1746 we did secure to the amount of about twenty thousand Rupees, about half of which sum has been delivered back to Mahomet Beg to clear him of Surat, and for the use of his ship, nor will the remainder be sufficient to maintain him and his followers and put the ship in a proper posture for proceeding to Gombroon at the next fair season, as she must be navigated by Officers and people hired here, as he has none. It will be needless for us to repeat to the Agent and Council how unjustly and to what great amount the Company have suffer'd, particularly from the late Nadir Shaw's oppressions who dispatched these Persians hither, and altho* it Gombroon Agent would not be unjust to detain this ship in part satisfaction yet before we be resolve on such a step it is agreed that we wait to be informed from them what be greeted consequences might ensue therefrom to the Company's affairs under their PieSncy what management, and it will be well if they could obtain a proper written authority for our so doing of which due notice must be taken to them.

The Agent and Council must likewise be directed to return the Brake Gombroon Agent &amp; to us as soon as they can, putting on board her such Copper, etc., as they ^TornThe D»ke may have in warehouse, and also what treasure they have, reserving sufficient KeUh with wI » a t for their necessary expenses; but in case the ballance of their cash should be Tie. sme they have considerable and the Ilchester in readiness to sail, with the Drake, they X^Ve^eidyT^ must divide its amount equally on them otherwise consign the whole hither on f ai '^1? ^ the 1 I ? 1 ^ 0 to divide it equally the Drake. on them and ' ——t- consign it to Bombay.

By the first conveyance they shall send it all to Bombay w ith Copy of their examination, &amp;o. That the shores with their King Achmat Shaw have been so successful as to take Shyrash, which gave so much credit to their affairs that thousands joined them from all parts, this gave them great apprehensions tho' Gombroon lay at so great a distance for from the usage Messrs. Graves &amp; Dalrymple received at Spahaun, they had no reason to expect any curtesey would be shewn them, should they come that way, &amp; soon after chappars arrived there with orders to take great quantitys Confusio m Persia ^ ra ^ 11 ^ mon ey from the Head People in Government &amp; 50,000 Tomands, after Nadir shah's or ten Lack of Rupees from them &amp; the Dutch, but the Drake Ketch &amp; a shah captures Shiras. jarge Dutch ship being in the harbour, they had not as then made their demand Messrs. 1 Graves and public. This, however, obliged them to come to an agreement with the Dutch Epahan^Gombrooo ^ Ally Shaw for their common safety, which was that the Europeans threatened. The should ship off all their most valuable effects on board the Drake, &amp; Dutch Agency prepare to . ., _ leave. ship, &amp; if they were not capable of taking them all in, then Mulah Ally Shaw should lend them one of the Persian Ships to take in the remainder, &amp; to be manned with English and Dutch sailors also that all their subjects whether Europeans or others should have liberty to transport their effects to the islands for security and then to remain in their respective habitation till the enemy draw near. That on the 13th December arrived there one Abdulla Oaun, with orders to receive the aforesaid money, but having only ten men with him, he had not dared to give the least disturbance, nevertheless as he was a sharp Cunning Eellow he had so far prevailed on Moolah Ally Shaw as to make bim entirely alter his notion of the shores, &amp; were preparing a petition to his Majesty representing the poverty of the subjects thereabouts, &amp; that they are unable to pay the whole amount laid on them, but would consent to pay one year's revenue, from which proceedings they judged he is entirely flown off from his engagements with them &amp; the Dutch &amp; they bad therefore come to a resolution to pnt him in mind of his promise to lend them one of the Persian ships, by which they shall at least see how he stands effected, &amp; in case he denies them, wait till they have a conveyance from Bombay or a large Dutch Vessel daily expected from Bussorah unless the near approach of the enemy obliges them to pursue other measures. That by the freshest advices the Bactiary's had subdued, Eessan Dorab &amp; Taroon all places of great strength and held the Bui work of the hot Country s which gave them no hopes to expect they'll not come that way, nor do they see any hopes of relief before summer. That the breditors are still there and very uneasy at the delays they meet withj they therefore desire our determination on this head as soon as possible, &amp; as the present prospect of subsisting Troubles gives great room to apprehend they shall at last be obliged to leave the shore, they request we will immediately transmit them Orders how to act, whether to proceed to Bombay or repair to any of the Islands in the Gulph. The Dutch give out they will go away for jndia immediately on embarking tho' by private information they find they have thoughts of seizing upon the Island of Carrack near Bouchier, &amp; this73 theythink will be a fine opportunity of executing the proposal they made in their last of seizing the Persian Eleet &amp; settling at Bahreen. That the 11- December Mr. James Dalrymple departed this life never having recovered the fatigues of his journey. That the Drake had exhausted all her stores &amp; was short of her full Compliment of men which they desire we will take into consideration. That the ballance of their cash last Month was Shahees which was all ready packed up in order to ship off on board the Drake as occasion requires &amp; they shall use all endeavours to prevent as little loss to the Hon'ble Company as possible.

Major Mackenzie indisposed. Eead and approved our last consultation. Read the letter from the Agent &amp; Council at Gombroon, dated the 11- ultimo as per abstract in the Diary under the 23^ Instant. In respect to the Agent &amp; Council's request for our directions in regard to Orders on the their future proceedings, the Board now takes into Consideration, the present fro^Gombrofn*^ 1 situation of their affairs, &amp; after maturely weighing &amp; deliberating on the measures most proper to be pursued, resolved that a Letter be wrote to the Agent &amp; Council to the following purport as what appears most eligible for their own security &amp; the H?- Company's advantage &amp; that the same be sent by a Shybar Express, which the Marine Paymaster is directed to get in readiness as soon as possible. First the Board presumes the Agent &amp; Council will not be so indiscreet as to abandon the H?r Company's Factory at Gombroon till their Estate &amp; their own Lines are in danger, fe that in such case they will retire on board the Shaftesbury with the most valuable of their Effects, &amp; despatch the Drake Ketch hither immediately with their Treasure, &amp; advices of their proceedings, after which they are to endeavour to come to some terms of accommodation with the prevailing party for preserving the H 0 - Company's Priviledges &amp; resettling themselves there again in quiet. But should they find it impracticable to come to any agreement or to return to their Factory at least till the Government becomes settled under one head, and have any good encouragement to settle on any Island up the Gulph near Bunder, Bushire, or Bunder Bique where they are sure there is water and provisions &amp; the inhabitants will permit them to land &amp; join with them for their mutual defence. The Board is of opinion it will be most eligible to settle there, till the Troubles in the Kingdom of Persia are subsided. But in the meantime they must use their endeavours to dispose of the Woollen, &amp;c., Goods they have on hand, at the several ports up the Gulph, eveo should they be obliged to go up to Bussorah for that purpose, for sending them hither will only put the Company to the expence of carrg. them back again as they are proper for that market only. That, however, in case of their leaving Gombroon the 67 b'. D74 Gombroon, L. from. Anarghy in Persia. Trade at a stand* atill. Russian trade. Hnla Arabs and Mullah Ali Shaw. His insolence towards the English. Board cannot approve of their carrying away the Persian Ships with them, for the reasons given them in our advices per Shaftesbury. LXI. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 25—1752, Bombay Castle, February 17th, 1752. Imported the Mamoody, Captain George England, from Gombroon and by her received a letter from the Agent and Council there dated the 17th January advising receipt of ours of the 23rd November per Rose Galley, which imported there the 21st December, and acquaints us that they had forwarded our advices for the Hon'ble Company to the 10th ultimo. That the stores and stationery we consigned them per Rose Galley turned out agreeable to invoice, and that they were sorry to acquaint us, that the unsettled state of the country would not admit of their supporting our expectaU with regard to what they wrote us concerning woollen goods; at that time they were in hopes of a successful winter from the advices received from inland of many large caffilas being on the road for that place, but upon their arrival, they found that the Government in all parts was grown so bad that most of the noted Merchants were afraid of risquing their lives and effects under it any longer for which reason many of them had invested, their money in Jewels, etc., and were gone with their familes to Mecca, where they proposed to reside untill the Country was brought under some regular authority. Those that remained behind had purchased in cloth and perpets to the amount of 60,000 Rupees &amp; had con tracted with them for the amount of 50,000 more which would be paid for and carried away sometime that month. That since the arrival of the above men tioned caffillas it had been currently reported there that the Russians had opened a trade in woollen Goods between Astracan and Orange, a City in Tartary, to which a large navigable river led directly from the Caspian sea, from which very bad consequences might be expected as it would greatly prejudice our Hon'ble Masters Trade in the woollen manufacture. That their Carmenia Linguist acquaints them in his last advices that there was no likelihood of procuring any quantity of wool this season as it was extremely scarce in all the villages round about and not to be bought under 60 Sahees per Maund which would turn out upwards of 110 when picked and cleaned, but that their endeavours should not be wanting, to procure all they canat the lowest price. That the Kingdom continues in the same unsettled state as it had done for some years past. That towards the latter end of September the Hoola Arab sent over 16 trankeys with a great number of soldiers under pretence of paying some compliments to Moola Ally Shaw on the marriage of his daughter, but their real design was to carry off the Persian fleet, however he by some means or other prevailed upon them to withdraw in a friendly manner taking with them one ship and two Gallivatts, so that Moola Ally Shaw has now but one ship remaining. Nevertheless the expectations he was in of seeing his other ships arrive, and well fitted from hence, made him very insolent towards them * by threatening to force money from the people under their pro tection, taking up their servants and encouraging his people to abuse them, but as Moola Ally Shaw himself made daily mention of the cause from whence it proceeded, they therefore acquaint us, that Mahomet Beg Shamloo wrote him a long letter by the Rose Galley, giving him a circumstantial account of our misfortunes at Surat and Tellichery enlarging greatly on the despicable figure he says we make in the military way. He therefore desires him not to be any * The English.75 longer ignorant what poor sort of people we are, when put to the trya] assur ing him that if he was to exact the same Customs from them as he did from all the Armenians it would never be resented from hence. Por these reasons he hopes that in future he will keep up the dignity of a Persian Governour, and not to demean himself so far as to make them any more personal visits at the factory, but he should defer saying further, until he arrived with the Shipping } Proposal to detain when he would put him in a method to deal with them. That if we would Jbipg^Sm'at 8 therefore prohibit all assistance being given to Mahomed Beg, and his people they were of opinion it would be a means of keeping the Persian Ships here, for that if they should arrive at Gombroon, Moola Ally Shaw would certainly put some evil scheme in practice against them. That they had been under some apprehensions from a strong party of Ballooch which came that way in quest of plunder, but after remaining some time considering what route they should take marched off by way of the hot waters without doing any further mischief than carrying off the Cattle, belonging to the people therabouts. That the two eldest sons of Soliman Shaw, having escaped from Muscat had paid a visit to the Agent, and after a short conversation on the troubles in the country, they intimated how serviceable a large sum of money w T ould be in their present circumstances, but finding they could expect nothing of that kind from them, took their leave seemingly well satisfied, and were gone to Bussorah to head forces which Mustafa Caun was raising for them in Turkey upon whose departure they made them a small present. That enclosed where their General Books for last year, calculate of Quick Stock, Invoice and Bill of Lading of the Mamoody, etc. Papers as per List of the Packet. That Mr. Robert went having commenced factor desired permission to take his seat at their Board. That agreeable to our permission, they had entertained Mr. George Forbes as Surgeon of that Factory and Mr. Samuel Wilsion, one of England's midshipmen, they had ordered on shore, in the room of Daniel Sherman, who went away on the Drake. That Lieutenant Nicholas Wardman with his Detachment, returned by this Conveyance also Serjeant Maddox whom they had exchanged for Serjeant Hunt and Corporal Roberts for Corporal Oright who had received pay to the 1st December and Henry Thomson the European Gunsmith, who had been paid to the 1st instant. They request a drummer may be sent them by the next Conveyance. That the Subedar of the Bombay The doiachment at sepoys being much out of order, they desire he may be relieved and that all their sepoys, who have families here, were desirous of returning from the dis advantage they were under of receiving no pay, and that their allowance of provisions was not sufficient without it, and request we would send them single men in their room. That as their General Books could not be copied time enough to go by the Sector, they had sent calculate of Quick Stock over land to the Hon'ble Company. That there had been still continued so many evil conjectures in regard to the Weights of that Factory that they beg we would, in consideration of the characters of all those that were concerned, order all kinds of Goods to be weighed by the English Hundred Weight, reckoning- 16 maunds Fabrez of 7~ to each and to send them a compleat sett of Hund^! Quarters and Pounds with the clerk of the Markets Stamp upon them to prevent Disputes in future; That their Topasses having peti tioned them about their pay, only receiving 4 Rupees per month whereas by the new Regulations, those at Bombay received 5, which they desire our Orders about. That inclosed was an Account of the provision and Stores supplied the Mamoody during her stay there, also tneir Surgeons and Storekeepers Indents., ■which they desire may be complied with by the first Opportunity.76 •&gt;• LXII. PUBLIC DEPARTMENT DIARY No. 25—1762. Bombay Castle, June 12th, 1762. Gombroon, L from. Received a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon dated 24«tli February enclosing Duplicate of their last and acquainting us that some time N *} ir r l ch ^' ( ? h,ef after the Mamoocjy's Departure, One La', wtackg _ 0 f ' r Gombroon. Hw • Nasseer Caun * bad come down there oppremon. and seized on Moola Ali Shaw, his Ship Eamily and all his valuable effects and Factory! daily plundered all the wealthy inhabitants, extorting money from them by Torture, and that one of them had died under their tortures a few days before. That after Nasseer Caun had possessed himself of the Port, he made them a visit at the Factory where he professed a great deal of Friendship for them and acquainted them, he would appoint any one Governour, whom they should nominate which the Agent had evaded, as genteely as possible; That as he acknowledged noSuperiour, they had been obliged to make him and his Officers a present to the amount of 100 Tomaunds, and that tho' he had taken upwards of 80 tomans from the Factory Banians, they thought it most advisable to say nothing of it, as he had taken above six times that sum from the Dutch. That from these instances of his opperession, they were afraid he might send to borrow money ar goods of them before he went, when it would be to no purpose to refuse him, unless they resolved to leave the Factory, which would be attended with a much greater loss as the goods in warehouse and on board the Rose Galley, were more than any common ship could carry and that it would be rash to attempt defending it against him who had all the country under his Command and could soon bring them thro' want of water and Provisions to his Own terms; That the kingdom was farther than ever from being under any r egular Government, Every Province being under subiection to a dilferent people, who are independent of one another, and that therefore they humbly presume it would be more for the Hon'ble Company's interest to remove to one of the adjacent Islands, such as Kishme or Angar, and beg leave to lay before us the advantages that would accrue therefrom. First that our property would be secure without the expense of presents to every new Persian Governour, which for many years past had amounted to a large sum annually. That that security would bring many merchants to reside there under our protection, so that the Customs alone would in a few years be sufficient to maintain a garri son, and the profits on trade remain a clear gain, That they apprehend our greatest objection to removing, would be the relinquishing the Factory, afte r its having cost so much money to which they answered that as it would require two ships and 300 soldiers to settle them, they could easily with their assistance remove all the usefull timber from thence which would be almost sufficient for their new habitation. That a great expense in building Gombroon Factory was the bringing stones and mortar, from Kishme and Ormus, whereas it was found by experience that bricks dried in the sun, answer as well and turn out a great deal cheaper. That for many years past, the merchants had complained of the great oppressions of the Government, which convinces them they would come and settle under the Company's protection, and that then every petty Governour, where they landed their goods, thro' the hopes of accumulating all the profit to himself would treat them with great civility, whereas now the shawbunders or customhouse Officers, without fixing any percentage on goods exacted frequently 16 or 17 per cent. That this Difference to Merchants would certainly establish the center of all Trade between Muscatt and Busaorah of that Settlement, /77 LXLII. Francis Wood , agent at Gombroon, to the Hon'ble Richard Bourchier , Esq., President and Governour, etc., Council on Bombay. H on'ble S ir &amp; S irs, The Bombay Frigate imported here the 18th of May, when Captain Prettie delivered me a Packet from your Honour, etc., inclosing a letter to the Hon'ble Court of Directors, which was forwarded to Mr. Ellis the 20th of that month under cover of a General Letter from hence, wherein I acquainted them with every Thing of Importance relating to this Settlement ; and by- he Drake Ketch which arrived here the 16th ultimo, I recvd. your Honour, etc., command dated the djth of July, with the Packet inclosed, which shall be transmitted by the first safe conveyance with particular advices concern ing the Hon'ble Company's Affairs in Persia. As there does not appear to me to be any extraordinary Necessity f or Detention of onij keeping more than one vessel here for the Security of the Hon'ble Company's one 70,361 re&lt; i uir0&lt;1 - effects, I have taken the opportunity of despatching the Rose Galley, in Company with the Bombay Frigate, and a small French ship, in hopes that by a mutual Defence they may be able to resist Angria, or any other Enemy that may chance to encounter them, and esteeming them (in this situation) to be safe conveyances I have laden on board the Rose four chests of Treasure each containing ten thousand Rupees, and the like upon the Bombay Frigate, with four Bales of Carmenia Wool ; the whoel amounting to Shahees, eight hundred and thirteen thousand, seven hundred and seventy eight (813,778) as pr. Invoice and Bills of Lading icclosed. Upon removing the Hon'ble Company'a cloth from the Rose Galley, in order to tranship it on board the Drake, many of the Bales were found to be extremely rotten, and the Package of all of them in general very much impaired, therefore to prevent any further Damage, I have ventured to take them all on shore, judging it more advisable to risque them in the Factory Warehouses than to let them remain on board Ship, where they are obliged to be unstow'd and stow'd sometimes twice or thrice in a month to come at such particular Bales as are wanted for the Marchants, which not only destroys the Package but is also a very great inconveniency. I am sorry to acquaint your Honour, etc., with the large quantity of o 00 ^ 8 The market dull&lt; that still remains unsold out of the Hector and Prince Henrye's cargoes ; but on account of the troubles up country this market has of late been extremely dull, and in order to encourage the marchants, I have hitherto suffered them to take any colour or sortment of goods which they liked best, without regard to giving out a proportion of each as customary, for which reason I now inclose an indent of such Articles as are wanted, which I beg your Honour, etc., will comply with pr. first Opportunity. In the month of April last we supplied Bussorah Residency with sixty bales of cloth, and sixty four bales of Perpets, which I hope will effectually put a stop to the Dutch Trade in these Commodities between Aleppo and that place as we gave78 Mr. Ellis particular Directions to undersell them, and endeavour to render this Branch of Trade disadvantageous, by all fair means that he could possibly invent. I have done all that laid in my power to procure the Quantity of Carmenia Wool indented for by the Hon'ble Court of Directors pr. Prince Henry, but have hitherto been able to collect no more than two hundred and seventeen maunds, though by a Letter which I reced. from Carmenia the 2nd instant, four hundred maunds more is upon the Eoad ; and your Honour, etc., may be assured of my best endeavours to provide all that may be procurable, so as to have a considerable Quantity in readiness to transmit pr. next safe conveyance. It gives me much concern to advise your Honour, etc., with the melan choly news of the agents, Mr. Went's, and Mr. Perceval's being dead : We had an extremely unwholesome season from the Beginning of March last, until the latter end of August during which time great numbers of the country inhabitants died, as did several of our Sepoys, and Topasses, and I myself was twice so far gone that the Surgeon did not imagine I could recover ; nor indeed I can't say I am yet, (though the weather begins to be pretty tolerable) as I am still troubled with an ague and fever, which comes upon me every third day. All the deceased persons* effects were put under the Hon'ble Company's seal immediately after their departure, in the presence of Captain Kerr, and Doctor Eorbes, and I have wrote to the Register of the Major's Court concerning the disposal of what belongs to Messrs. Went and Perceval, as they both died intestate. ^ ^ ^ All the Rogoms, Orders, and Grants, that are of any consequence relating tranektion of to the Hon'ble Company's priviledges in Persia have been carefully collected, rogom» and firmans. hitherto I have not been able to get a capable person to translate them, which obliges me by necessity to defer executing this Part of your Honour, etc., commands longer than I should otherwise dare to do, though as our Linguist's brother (who arrived a few days ago from Bundereck) is a sensible man, and speaks the English and Persian Languages exceeding well, I hope through his assistance to have this Business performed in a correct manner. Time enough to transmit pr. first conveyance. Description of ^ a c ^ scr ip^ on Angar which your Hon 1 etc., direct to be given Bahrein and I shall mention it Word for Word from a Letter which the Agent wrote me when he was upon the Spot in the month of March last.^—' It is an Island somewhat larger than Bombay intirely covered with Rocks, destitute of Inhabitants or animals of any kind, Sandy, and barren of all Vegetables excepting two Trees, and tufts of hard prickly Grass, and the water is intoler ably bad unless it be a small quantity contained in two or three old tanks which stand toward the Kishmiss side of the Island.' From this account I humbly apprehend your Honour, etc., will esteem angar a very unfit place to settle at, and your objections to our taking possession of any of the Per sian Islands, (which I have maturely considered) are certainly founded upon the strongest Probability ; therefore with great Submission, I presume to give it as my Opinion, that the Watering Place at the South-East Poiat of Kishmiss without having any thing to do with the other part (called by the Persian Tezera Draws) would prove more convenient, and answer the Hon'ble Com pany's Purpose, (which I take to be the Security of their Effects and Servants) far better than a larger Place, provided Matters could be managed so as to procure a Grant of it from the King or from Nesseir Caun, who is at present79 Governour of the hot Countries, as there is a good small Fortification ready- built to our Hands lying within Sight of Gombroon Factory, which might be defended by 40 men and an Ensign against any Country Enemy, excellent Water in Plenty, and Prov e very cheap, so that there would be no Occasion to risque any considerable Part of the Hon'ble Company's Goods or Money out of the Castle ; and a small vessel, such as the Content Sloop, would be suffi cient for all services between Gombroon and Kishmiss. I can get no better Intelligence relating to the Island of Bahreen, than its being a Place held in superstitious generation by the Hoolah Arabs, and that it is very fertile, abound g with Springs of fresh Water, but both the Air and W ater are extremely unwholesome according to the Account of several Persons who have been formerly Inhabitants of that Place. Ishmail Shaw still bears the Title of King, though being Young, and Ciyil war in Peraia. greatly kept under by Careem Caun, he has no Share at all in the Government; and indeed Careem Caun himself is little better than Governour of Spahaun, as the Country remains in the same distracted Condition now as, it has done for many Years past, every City with the Adjacent Villages, being as it were a distinct Principality at Variance with the next, and I really can't see the least Appearance of the Countrys being settled.—As to Shawrook Shaw, here- sides in Mushat without any Shew of Royalty at all, and being entirely Blind seldom or never appears in publick, so that in his present unhappy Circum stances, the Persians esteem him as nothing. I am sorry to acquaint your Honour, etc., that our Revenues this year and considerably less than they were last, the Consulage amounting to no more than Shahees, thirty two thousand, six hundred and ninetyeight, five Goz, and a half (32,698-5^) and Export Duty to Shahees, four thousand, eight hundred and forty six Goz and a half (4,840-6J) which of Course is occasioned by^ the Difference of the Trade at this place. All the Stores, Weights, and Gunpowder, which your Honour &amp; con. signed us p r . Bombay Frigate, have been received agreeable to Invoice; and our Gunner Stephen Young now returns on this Vessel, in whose Place Matthew Crawley is entertained here; Serjeant Phillip Lemire having requested Permission to return to Bombay, proceeds also upon the Bombay Frigate, and Ensign Martin Burrage is entertained as Military Officer at this Factory. Herewith your Honour, &amp;c., will receive the following Books and Papers by the Rose Galley, viz\ No. 1, two sets of Diarys and Consultations, No. 2 two sets of Steward's Account, No. 3 Monthly Account of Provisions and Stores supplied the Mamoody, No. 4, Monthly Account of the same supplied the Rose Gaily No. 5 List of the Arrival and Departure of Shipping.

No. 8 Indent for Woollen Goods to supply the Gombroon market No. 9 General Letter of this Date, No. 10 Duplicate of the Bombay Frigate's Invoice, No. 11 List of Money stopt from the Soldiers belonging to the Mamoody's Detachment, No. 12 Indent of medicines for the use of the Factory.—And by the Bombay Frigate, viz h . No. 1. Duplicate of the General Letter p r . Rose Galley, No. 2 invoice and Bill of Lading No. 3 Duplicate of the Ros« Galley's Invoice. The General Books of this Settlement could not possibly be got ready. Time enough to go by this conveyance, which seeming Neglect I beg your Honour, &amp;c., will be pleased to pass over, as they shall be transmitted by the next secure con veyance.80 Having mentioned every thing of importance that I can at present recollect, I shall here conclude with great Respect. Hon'ble sir and sirs, Your most faithfully, and most obedient servant, Gombroon. The 17th September 1752. FRANCIS WOOD. LXIV. Francis Wood , agent at Gombroon to the Hon'ble Court of Directors &amp; Co. Mat it please tour honour. Russian trade. Carmania wool. Disadvantages of withdrawing from Oombroon. In regard to what we wrote to your honours under the 31st of December last concerning the Russian Trade in broad cloth, &amp;c., Europe Commodities upon the borders of Persia and Tartary; I am in great Hopes that their Scheme has proved disadvantageous, as upon a strict enquiry (which I made) of several persons lately arrived from Mushat and Spahaun, I could learne no other News of these Adventurers than that they have brought only and Vessel to Eahst since Captain Elton's death (which happened near three years ago,) and sold their goods on board Ship for ready money, not daring to trust either themselves or Effects on shore; but I have not been able to get Intelligence of what particular Species their Cargoes consisted, which I will endeavour to learne (in case they proceed any further) and advise your Honours p r . first Opportunity, it being a Matter of considerable Importance to affairs here. On account of the great Scarcity of Goats in the Carmenia Villao-es I have not been able as yet to procure any more Wool than what I have already said has been laden on board the Bombay Erigate; but yesterday evening I reced. a Letter from Carmenia advis 8 . me of four hundred Tabreeze maunds being ready to send down p r . first Caphila, and your honours may be assured of my utmost Endeavour to compleat the quantity ordered p r . Prince Henry with all possible expedition. I have carefully perused every Thing that has been wrote from hence (both to y r . honours, and to the Governour and Council of Bombay) upon the Subject of removing from Gombroon, and have maturely considered the Advan tages which according to our Conjectures would proceed from such a Step but find many weighty Objections that may be made thereto, and the Benefit expected from our having possession of one of the Persian Islands are in general very precarious, and not all adequate to the Certainty of breaking Friendship or perhaps of maintaining a War with the I'ersians, on whom the sale of our Woollen Goods entirely depends; and the Dutch (who still keep a resident here and have Thoughts of resettling their Factory in it's former Credit,) would not fail to aggravate them against us from the fix't jealousy that they have of our Success. In Regard to your Honours' Effects, or Servants falling into the hands of the Shores, &amp;c.. Freebooters, the danger of it is now nothing like so great as it was, the Shows being all returned to their former habitation in the mountains, excepting a few who are entertained at Spahaun in Ishmael Shaw's Service, and the Hot Countries being kept under pretty good subjection by Nasseir Caun, so that while we have a Factory close to the sea-side with81 men and Guns to defend us, a guard-ship also lying constantly in the Eoad, I really can't see any cause to leave Gombroon through Fear even of the worst that a body of undisciplin'd Rabble can do. It is certainly requisite to keep a Vessel of Force upon this Station until the Kingdom be throughly settled, for however improbable it may seem, it is not impossible that we may at last have Occasion for such a Eetreat, and those (if there be any) that have evil Intentions towards us will never think it worth their while to attempt the taking our Factory when we have an Opportunity of leaving the shore with all the most valuable Effects, whenever we find Occasion for so doing. To conclude, what I have here troubled your Honours with on this subject, I shall take leave with the greatest submission humbly to offer it as my opinion that the Scueme of settling upon any of the Islands is in no wise advisable, unless the King's Phirmaund can be previously obtained and even then it might not perhaps answer the expence of building Fortifications and maintain ing a large Garrison. Shahrook Shan resides still at Mushat, in the same manner as if he was only Governour of that city. Your most obedient Servant FRANCIS WOOD. G ombeoon. The 28tk September 1752. LXV.

Inclosed under No. 2 &amp; a monthly account of Provisions &amp; neces saries supplied her from 1st August to the 22nd June was particularized under No. 3. —That in the Month of October last Nasseir Caun received82 Governor of KiBhm I n ^ e ^o enoe Abdul Shaik (Govr of ITisma) had agreed to sell the Persian. His proceedings. Ship which came from Bombay in March 1752 to the Sciddee of Muscat whereupon he dispatched two choppars express with letters to Mr. 'Wood requesting his assistance in very positive terms to prevent the said ship from falling into the hads of the Arabs declaring that he would shortly be down himself upon the occasion &amp; should highly resent it in case of its being carried off, as their late Agent had engaged to use his utmost endeavours to protect the King's fleet against the Arabs or any other enemies &amp; therefore he ought not to have suffered Abdul Shaik at first to have carried her into Lhoft River, from whence he then insisted on their bringing her back. That Mr. Wood not chusing to interfere in matters of that kind if possible to avoid it, made use of all the arguments he could invent to excuse himself, but finding them to no purpose &amp; that he must inevitably involve the Hon'ble Company in immediate troubles with the Persians by an obstinate refusal he thought better to comply &amp; therefore sent the Drake in Company with the Uamamy upon that expedition when Abdul Shaik delivered her up in a friendly manner without the least resistance or even firing a single gun on either side. That the Nancy Grab belonging to the Dutch Gentlemen at Surat arrived there the 23rd April but being in expectation of better marketts up the Gulph proceeded immediately between Kismis &amp; the main without waiting to take in a Pilot &amp; shortly after run ashore upon the Rocks near old Lhoft where she was intirely broke to pieces &amp; most of her cargo seized by Bfties of cloth, etc. Abdul Shaik. That broad cloth &amp; perpets were goods so particularly adapted to the Persian taste &amp; so necessary for their dress in the winter season, that there must be at all times a great demand for them up country as there was at that time, but the merchants were obliged to run such great hazards from robbers on the roads &amp; suffer so many impositions from the people in Govern ment that for sometime before very few of them had had courage venture down. That they had sold since the 31st July last 312 bales of cloth with all the perpets they had in warehouse &amp; having still 340 bales remaining out of the Hector, Prince Henry &amp; Mamoody's Cargoes, their Indent to the Hon'ble Court of Directors for next year's supply had been but very small &amp; if we would complete the quantity of perpets requested by Mr. Wood in September last it would conduce greatly towards the speedy vend of the above remains which from being frequently transhipped from one vessel to another had not only suffered in the package but had taken a damp into them which occasioned a continual decay tho' they had for several times had them out to air in the sun &amp; still continued to do all they could to preserve them. That they had disposed of the cochineal consigned them B Hector part at 60 and part at 60 Rupees Br. Fabreze Maund which was but a little more than prime cost but they were glad to get it off at those prices rather than lay &amp; spoil in the warehouse as it was a very bad article for that as well as the Bussorah Markett where they proposed to have sent it last year, had not Mr. Ellis assured them it would by no means answer. That the merchants of Persia imagined the double coloured drabs were invented by the Europeans to save the expense of scarlet dye and therefore esteemed them, much less than if they were of one colour only, for which reason they now consigned us nine chests of them by that vessel to prevent their being rendered of no value thro' the heat of the warehouses there where they had remained at that time near two years. That the medley cloth they found was more apt to receive Damage than the0 83 other sortments in so much that generally four and sometimes five Pieces in a bale were spotted with mildew from one end to the other, the coarse cloth also particularly that by the Mamoody was in very bad condition upon which account they had sold and still continue to sell them at much lower rates than the usual prices as they must otherwise lay and be entirely destroyed by the Worm which in spite of all their care could not be kept out of them. That the twenty-five bales of perpets which we consigned them by the Bose were landed the day after her arrival and Mr. Ellis had also received those goods that we sent him Per Neptune Galley for the amount of which they had given us due credit. That by the Bombay frigate we received 217 maunds Fabreze of Carmenia Wool and they had laden on board the Drake 12 Bales containing 720 Maunds more which was all they had in warehouse tho' they were in great hopes by that time to have been able to send us a much larger quantity as their Linguist acquainted them (in a Letter that came to hand the 25th May) that he had purchased nine hundred Maunds, 690 of which were then upon the road towards that place under the care of a trusty Person accompanied by a strong Caffela, and that he had a fair prospect of collecting above a thousand Maunds more in a short time. That they had been parti cularly careful in giving proper directions from time to time concerning that business and in making the necessary remittances for carrying it on but the Village People from whom the Wool was brought up in small Quantities sus tained so many losses in their cattle from the Government and small bands of robbers who were continually traversing those parts of the Country where anything was likely to be got that that Government could not be expected to go on agreeable to their wishes or to be completed so soon as it might be in time of peace. That the 24th JNovember Nasseir Caun arrived there from Lhor with „ . ^ . .. 1 Nasir Khan s visit 2,000 Offgoons and Persian Soldiers in order to regulate his affairs among to Gombroon and the petty Governours of the countries adjacent to that place and to settle ex 0r 10nS, Moolah Ally Shaw again in his former station of Admiral of the King's fleet which he has obliged to do having no other person about him so capable of that trust. The Sultoon's Presence being absolutely necessary at Hodjeeabant to keep the Offshan Tribes thereabouts from revolting he remained there until the 29th January and then returned but during his stay he contracted a debt with the Factory Brokers to the amount of shahees 99935:5 in broad cloth, fabbies and sattins probably to make Apparel for his Families and Dependants which they by no means could avoid supplying him with as the hazard of a refusal would have been far greater than that of trusting to his honesty in regard to payment. That some time before the Caun's departure Mr. Wood (being alarmed with the Eeport of the soldiers making ready to march and also with Mynheer Scondeiwoerts being obliged to accept of bills on several discreditable Persons for goods bought by the Oaun at the Dutch Factory) sent the Head Broker down to the Castle to settle accounts with Messey Sultoon who managed all his affairs, directing a handsome present to be offered if occasion required, to induce him to pay them in ready money but he returned for answer that cash was so very low with them and their expenses so very great that it was impossible to be done, tho 5 as he had not then come to any agreement with him ; for four brass guns sent on board the Drake some time before he would give him another, which the Caun found too heavy to carry up country if he would be satisfied to take them for the balance of their accounts without giving any further trouble. Therefore after consulting with the Linguist and both the Brokers who were of the same opinion that it would84 be better not to refuse that offer for fear of losing the whole, Mr. Wood consented and the five guns which were then on board the Drake they had included in her Invoice as also 997J Maunds of old copper, consigned to us upon the Honourable Company's Risque and account. That by the latest advices from up-country they learnt that the Offgoons were making great preparations at Candahar to invade that kingdom (Ahmad Shaw their General being resolved if possible to possess himself of the Throne of Persia) and in the month of March last he sent a Vackeel to Carmenia to demand a large sum of money threatening utterly to destroy that city with all the inhabitants in case of their non-compliance at that time they were relieved from the appre hensions they were under on that account affairs of Consequence having since state of Persia. that time drawn most of his forces towards Muscat, where Meer Allem Caun murdered. Karim and Jaffer Caun had murthered Sharrook Shaw and thereby got possession of immense Riches with which it was to be feared they would prove very trouble some if Ahmet Shaw did not Occasion some sudden alteration in their Affairs as they could have no just Pretension to set up for themselves being of mean Pedigree and formerly Domes tick servants to the King tho' it was not certain whether Ahmet Shaw was really going against those Gauns or not, and it was much to be feared if he would succeed in case he was to go upon that conditions as his soldiers in general were led into Persia (where they had little or no hopes of Plunder) quite contrary to their inclinations, and many of his principal Officers lately entered into a conspiracy against his life which being discovered (tho* many hours before it was to be executed) the said officers were immediately put to death and orders dispatched with all expedition to Candahar to seize many others who were concerned with them in the affair, which had occasioned great confusion in his Army as well as among the great men who held the Government in his absence. That Careen Caun some months past marched from Spahaun with about 10,000 soldiers against several Tribes of Cadjars, who having united were become exceedingly powerful in those parts but being jealous of those unto whom he must commit the charge of the city until his return he carried Ishmael Shaw with him who was unfortunately taken Prisoner by a Strong Party of the Enemy who lay'd in Ambascade at the Entrance of a narrow pass in the Mountains and fell upon him after the greatest part of the Army had entered the Passage. He Still remained in their hand at Mazandroon where he was then almost forgotten and Careen Caun with about 500 of his soldiers whom he still kept in pay being afraid to return to Spahaun supported himself in the Countries thereabout by rapin and plunder. That Shaw Sultan Hossein who it was thought would have been established on the throne by the Turks as then had made little or no advance ment towards bringing the kingdom under subjection, tho' on account of his being the lawful heir to the crown, most of the Persians were inclined to favour his party and would be well satisfied to see him quietly seated in the Government, but thro' want of true Loyalty or the fear of being called to an account for the revenues of the countries under their command, none of the Great Men chose to lend him any assistance, so that it would be in all probability many years before that country came to be settled, tho' when things were brought to the worst, there was almost some hopes left of their changing for the better and at that time they really seemed to be reduced to as low an ebbe as possible but there was no judging how long they might be before they rose, they beg'd leave to assure us that that country was in85 as much confusion then as it had been for many years the Spahaun was then in the hands of Careen Oaun's brother independent of any other person, Ghelam Mushat and Kirmoonshaw the Fabreze and Carasoon Countries and indeed all Persia in general was divided under the jurisdiction of different Oauns who had taken possession of all the strong Forts and Cities of importance throughout the .Kingdom—That it was true the Hot Countries were kept tolera bly quiet under Nasseir Caun upon whose friendship their safety there entirely depended and in case of his death there was no other Person in proper Auth ority to keep the soldiers and petty Governours under due command, who imagined the European Factories there to be immensely rich, and that great Treasures were to be obtained by the plunder of them, so that it was not to be doubted they would bind all their force towards them at such a juncture especially if they knew they had no means of escaping or securing their valuable effects by means of Shipping, however they had no Cause to be under any apprehensions of Danger for that or any such like accidents so long as a Vessel of Force remained upon that station, which they begged leave to assure us, was quite necessary until the Kingdom was settled. That the sea had of late years gained considerably upon the lands about Gombroon ^ T oo n - which occasioned the surf to break with greater force than usual against the factory wharf at the time of the spring tides, whereby the stones were in many places quite washed away and the whole shaken in such a manner that a thorough repair was absolutely necessary to prevent its falling into ruins in which as well as all other expenses we might be assured of thei r utmost care and frugality. That upon the Rose Galley Alexander Douglas JBsqr., came to take charge of that Agency which was delivered over to-f Iexander ® 0 ! lgla8 ' , » , . _ Agent at.Gombroon, him, and the Hon ble Company s cash on counting turned out exactly right. The remains in warehouse and accounts of dead stock, etc., were also examined shortly after and proved agreeable to the General Books allowing for what was actually expended and worn out last year and omitted to be wrote off, excepting the following particulars, tabbies and sattins Per Boscawen each two pieces, one silver inkstandish, twenty nine and a half guz of cut cloth and 17 old iron guns. The former four articles Mr. Wood assured them were never delivered into his charge neither had he seen them in the factory since his arrival and as he suffered considerably on making up a deficiency of old remains as would appear from Journal Y'. Y. Folio 32 under the 31st July 1751, tho* they were missing a long time before he came to Gombroon and the warehouses were entirely empty when he arrived upon the Drake he hoped we would not deem him answerable for the above articles. That as to the old Guns he recollected that in July 1750 the Agent and Council intending to dispatch the Drake for Bombay ordered 17 useless guns to be returned upon her, and they were accordingly sent on board but on account of the Lhorrs plundering Spahaun, and troubles breaking out in different parts of the country about that time she was detained at Gombroon for about 12 months afterwards and the guns remaining all that while in her hole were quite for gotten and of course not taken notice of in their accounts or advices to us. That this transaction also appeared in their Inventory Book as Mr. Wood had related it from thence they had drawn out an Account particulars of them which the inclosed under No. 4. That Messrs. William Sedgwicke and John Parsons came to the assistance of that Agency by the Neptune) as did Mr. Eichard Seeker from Anjingo upon the Boneta Ketch but Mr. Sedgwicke was taken ill of a nervous fever and fits shortly after his arrival and died the86 9th June therefore they requested we would supply them with another capable servant in his stead. That we having been pleased to permit Mr. Francis Wood to return to Bombay he beg'd likewise to present us his sincerest Thanks for the same and should take the first convenient opportunity of leaving Gom broon. That Mr. William Shaw arrived there by the Guardian to succeed imcSu Inirat Mr * Brabazon Ellis in the Residency of Bussorah but the time to expect any Basrah. English Vessel bound up the Gulph being passed they had obtained a passage for him on a Dutch ship which was to sail for Bushire in a few days when they should give him proper instructions for his guidance and direct Mr. Ellis to deliver the charge of the Hon'ble Company's affairs to him so soon as a convenient opportunity should offer for returning to the Presidency. That two officers and 10 Sepoys came upon the Judith Ketch by which Vessel they had returned two officers and only 8 Sepoys five of their old Detachment being Dead. The Defence Ketch with those we designed them by her they had^lost all hopes of seeing till next season as there was then no news at all of that vessel. That they had then in garrison one Sergeant, one Corporal, Twenty four Topass Soldiers and Twenty-two Bombay Sepoys. Ensign Bunage Died of a fever the 11th of November and the soldiers who had continued at that Place for several years having desired Permission to return to their families at Bombay they re quested that we would send them.that Number by the first Conveyance to relieve them with an officer also to supply the place of Ensign Bunage and asitheir gunner was so much addicted to liquor, that for some time they had been obliged to entrust another person in the charge of his post a sober capable person was much wanted to keep their stores etc., in Order. Their carpenter also who was a Gentoo, and had a family on B'bay having suffered much by sickness was rendered almost incapable of service and therefore beg'd to be relieved. That we would receive from Captain Kerr one large hulee of diamonds marked A. R., belonging to a Zezd. Merchant named Aga Eizan who took his passage on the Drake, it was valued at above a Lack of Rupees, was sealed with his own as well as the Hon'ble Company's seal, and was taken in security for Broad Cloth sold him to the amount of 24,500 Rupees for which his bond No. 7 was inclosed. That at the time when the above goods were delivered him he promised to pay for them in four or five days at farthest and gave the above Diamonds into their hands, being then in expectation of receiving upward of 30,000 Rupees for pearl sold to the Dutch Chief who contrary to the agreement obliged him to take goods instead of ready money and as he was not able to dispose of his Diamonds upon any other conditions they had prevailed on him to go on that Vessel to Bombay with a promise that they would be delivered by us on his discharging the aforesaid. And as the Risk was no greater in the present case than if that Transaction had been concluded there, and the Remit tance made in money, they hoped we would not disapprove of it. That their gunner proceeded on that Vessel and had received his pay to the 31st May. They sent us two setts of the General Books for last year, etc. Papers as Per List of the Packet enclosed. By the Neptune received a short letter from Mr. Ellis at Bussorah acknowledging receipt of ours of the 12th November and 31st December P Neptune Snow on the 28th past and had duly received the Broad cloth and perpets consigned him from us by her and advised that our Packet to the Hon'ble Court of Directors when forward the 5th May by a Messenger express on the Occasion and requested his Majesty's Counsul at Allepo to give it the quickest Dispatch from thence after reaching his hands. That Pursuant to our Orders he would return to the Presidency on the Rose87 and deliver over to the William Shaw the charge of the Hon'ble Company's Affairs there. LXVI.

Gombroon; 27th October 1753. LXVII. Bombay Castle, 2Ut December 1753. Per the guardian received a letter from Agent and Council at Gombroon acquainting us that the 19th Instant they received our Commands P, Swallow ^om^ 000 ' letter and inclosed us duplicate of their last address per Bose Galley that they were theSLar- concerned they had incurred our displeasure by detaining the Guardian there dian at Gombroon, longer than the limited time and they should not pretend to vindicate them selves in regard thereto but should make it their chief est care in future strictly to obey all such commands as we might be pleased to lay upon them. That they had been as expeditious as possible in dispatching the Guardian and the detachment which were sent them by the Swallow were all entertained at that Settlement in their several capacities and they returned us by the Guardian one Sergeant, one Corporal, 23 Topass Soldiers and Indian carpenter, an Armourer and a Drummer, they had all received their pay to the last of that month excepting those mentioned in the inclosed list and provision for one month and a half that as the Salisbury brought them a supply of ^040 pieces of Perpets88 and the demand for them not appearing so great at the time of her departure as it had since they did not think it necessary to repeat their request in regard to completing Mr. Wood's Indent, hut in their address the Rose Galley they had done it and had also indented for an additional quantity of 2,000 Pieces which they heg'd we would be pleased to comply with by the first oppor tunity. That in their advices to us they requested we would supply the Eesi- dent at Bussorah with one thousand pieces of perpets of an equal proportion of colours as they were then unable to do it from thence but as he had since that time sent us a list of the particular colours that are proper for the Bussorah Market desiring that the said one thousand Pieces might be choosen according to that list they then inclosed us copy thereof that by that ship they consigned us 9 chests of treasure containing eightytwo thousand Rupees (82,000) and 5278 Pound of Carmenia wool upon the Hon'ble Company's account and Risque amounting to Sahees eight hundred and twentytwo thousand one hundred and sistythree and seven Goz (8,22,163-7) that they had already endeavoured to excuse themselves twice upon the Occasion of not specifying the Price of Carmenia Wool and they were sorry they were obliged to do it again for notwithstanding all that they could say to the linguist he would not transmit them an account thereof who in the last letter they received from him alleges all the Wool he had remitted them since the Month of May last was part of what He had Collected from the Village People in small quantities and at difFerent prices and that he had then a considerable quantity of it uncleaned therefore could not say how it would turn out. That Messrs. William Nash and William Hughes arrived there on the Swallow and that Mr. Francis Wood then returned to the Presidency on the Guardian and that conformable to our Reasons for detea- o^ers any vessel that might in future be stationed at Gambroon should be Honoftte Guar- included m their charges General. They allow our Remark in regard to the Guardian to be very just, but in excuse say that the principal motive tor thei detaining her was that so long as the Country People knew it was in their power to leave the shore at any time with everything belonging to the Hon'ble Company they would never make any attempt upon them which it was very necessary to guard against, as Nasseir Caun's situation has been for a long time very precarious, whose army tho' it oonsits of above twelve thousand men is scarce sufficient to resist the Arab Party from TJssurping- the Government and that by four messengers who passed Gombroon in their wav to Lhor with letters from Toggy Caun Syrozee to Nasseir Caun they were assured that the report of the Offgoons invading Persia was actually true Thev are also informed by the latest advices from Spahaun that all those parts of the country are in the greatest confusion imaginable, the City being in p®ssession of Ahzud Caun one of Shaw Sultans Hussein's General Officers, he being bv the Treachery of Ally Mardin Cauu, a prisoner among the Tribes in the Mountains of Loarastoon also that Carmenia has suffered a change of Govern ment and that they don't see any likelihood of the Kingdoms being settled for Movements ol Baron KnipnLXVIII.

Per the Rose Galley reced. a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon acquainting us that they transmitted their last advices to us Per Gombroon, letter Salisbury and took the opportunity P. the Rose Galley of forwarding their ^ and trade in General Books Stewards accounts and Diary ending the 31st July last, that Persl ' a - Settled they having already acquainted us with their reasons for detaining the ^ Guardian. They thought it needless to trouble us any further on that head than to assure us no consideration should induce them to keep her a day longer than .appeared for the flon'ble Company's interest. That in their Address of the 22nd June they requested we would take the first opportunity of completing Mr. Wood's Indent for Perpets and at the same time acknowledged the receipt of 500 pieces of them P. Rose but the demand for that article being greatly increased they bad inclosed an indent for 2,000 pieces more as they would be a great help to them in disposing of the large quantity of cloth remain- ing in warehouse which the merchants would not purchase without an unusual proportion of Perpets and the supply reced. per Salisbury would not be suffi cient. That under thel4ithof June last Mr. Ellis indented to them for IjOOO Pieces of perpets but being unable to comply with his request beg'd we would be pleased to do it. That they had heard nothing from their Linguist at Carmenia since 81st July when he acquainted them that the Dutch Vackeel (having orders to Engross all the Carmenia wool) had raised the price to above 80 Rs. maund, which with loss in weight clearing and other incident charge must turn out at least Es. 11. Therefore he desired them to direct him how to act in regard to the investment not chusing to proceed on such extravagant terms without our previous consent whereupon they took that affair into con sideration and after perusing the Hon'ble Company's and our orders to them concerning it which lay them under no limitation as to price they determined to continue purchasing till our pleasure was known and gave the Linguist orders accordingly. That not doubting than an invoice of the Wool consigned us P Salisbury would have been transmitted them from Carmenia long before that time they promised to send it us P the next Conveyance but the Linguist having been so negligent as to omit inclosing one in the above letter and as they had then received no answer to their repeated orders they remained under a necessity of deferring it to another opportunity. That Nasseir Caun still continued in the Government of the Hot Countries, tho' not without much Govl^enVo' the Difficulty as he was in a manner surrounded with enemies both Arabs and Hot Countries Persians with whom he is obliged to have frequent skirmishes and in order ^ ^ to deter others from revolting and those that fell into his hands with the greatest severity. That it was a considerable time since they had any certain Accounts of the state of affairs up Country but 'twas generally believed that Ahmat Shaw Affgoon would at last reduce the kingdom to Obedience and settle the Government as it was before the time of Nadir Shaw, Sharrook Shaw (as they advised them a long time since) was killed at Mushat by Jaffer Caun; Shaw Sultan Hossain who it was thought would have been placed on the Throne by the Turks remained with a great number of soldiers in Ade r Cajune but as then had done nothing extraordinary unless the report was true of his having defeated Carean Careem Caun's brother who advanced against him from Spahaun with a powerful Army in the month of June lastand Ismael Shaw continued in the hands of the Cadjars so that the prospect of peace seemed to be at as great a distance then as it had been for many years that they inclosed us a calculate of their Quick Stock to that L ay that Mr. Ellis took passage on the Rose having deliyered the charge of Bussorah Residency to Mr. Shaw, he had received his salary and Diet to the 21st August.

That the Hoolah Arabs having defeated Nassiers Caun's Forces several times be had been obliged to make peace with them, lhat Shawrook Caun, Governor of Carmenia, had been assisted with a body of troops from jSassier Caun against the former Governor and is an interview had solemnly promised serving him to the utmost. However Shawrook's enemies offering large sums of money, Nassier Caun had invited the former to a banquet and confined him prisoner, besieging Carmenia immediately after. But Shawrook C aun escaping into the city had obliged him to raise it; Nassier Caun laid waste all the country to Coroon and was then watching the motions of Azad Caun at Shyrash, and to prevent his making their province the seat of war, had sent him a large present. That by advices of 1st instant from Carmenia the principal men were set out with large presents for Azad Caun at Shyrash, and that Rustum Eangel Baumy, and Mahomet Eaza Caun, were constantly plundering round Carmenia. That Azad Caun took possession of Spahaun the 10th September aud immediately levied insuportable taxes on all the inhabitants there and at lulpha, and committed great cruelties, had near ruined Yezd massacred great numbers at Colbar &amp;. Ardacoun, and they were advised, he next designed pursuing Careem Caun to Cozaroon and return to Spahaun which they hoped would prevent his coming near them. That Careem Caun had often been defeated by Azad Caun, but was determined to make another effort, and had wrote Shaw Sultan Hossein, that if he would put Ally Mardan Caun to death he and several other leading men would serve him all in their power which .Ally Mardan Caun being advised of, had, it was reported, put out the eyes of Shaw Sultan Hossein. However Careem Caun had destroyed Ally Mardan Caun and seized his treasures which were considerable since when many powerful men had joined him defeated one of Azad Caun's generals, and designed to march to Spahaun. That Ahmud Shaw, the Offgoon King, had taken Hiraut and become master of the whole Corassoon country, Mushad had likewise submitted to him and he had taken the route for Spahaun.

That Kni- hoiSaflagf phausen had brought a letter from the General of Batavia for Soliman Bashan of Bagdad, demanding payment of the money taken from his Resident, and in case of non-compliance that he had sent a proper person to force him and restored .their affairs at Bussorah but the principal inhabitants there being very inveterate against Kniphausen had petitioned the Bashaw not to permit of his returning as they should all in that case quit the place, that they did not object to any other Dutch resident, and would themselves if necessary pay the money, which added to the General of Batavia's threat, induced, him to return . ' for answer that he would neither admit of Kniphausen's return, or refund &gt; anything alledging that he ought to have taken the whole amount of a Caravan set on by the Resident which he passed over only on account his former friendship which the Dutch, and for no other reason, was willing to re-establish their factory if he would send any other Resident than Kniphausen and then not by compulsion which letter was sent open that Kniphausen might take his measures accordingly. But in July he sent two ships to block up Bussorah river which would not allow any vessel belonging to the Country Powers to pass them, that they had stopt Ohellaby's two ships at Oarack on accot. some differences between them and Shaik Nassier. That they had quitted Bushier first destroying their house and gardens and retired to Carack. That in March 1753 the Council sold Anga Abdellah woollen goods to the amount of ten thousand rupees and took a parcel of diamonds valued, at sixteen thousand for security which were to remain as a deposit, till the Resident at Bussorah advised of receiving the money, when the diamonds were to be delivered to the Proprietor's order, or remitted to Bussorah on his account but the Resident had advised them, Anga Abdellah Sons Attorney alleged they were to be sent at the Hon'ble Company's risque, and he would not agree to any other condition. That they had in spected the Bond, and found the Diamonds were to be sent to Bussorah before redeemed, but not at the Hon'ble Company's risque, however they had resolved to wait our Directions regarding them, especially as the late Resident advised that he could expect nothing more than the deposit, which he hoped was an equivalent. ****** LXX.

S ir. l ly .—The Hon'ble the Court of Directors in their Command of the 5th April last, having left it to our Discretion to settle a servant at Bunderrieck in the Gulph of Persia, and we having carefully attended to such matter as has been delivered to us on this subject, deem it of advantage to them to fix a Factory there, and have pitched upon you to carry this our design into execution. You are therefore to take your passage on the Indian Queen, Captain John Demare (who has orders to receive and entertain you in a becoming manner) and follow the instruction hereafter mentioned, and all such others as you shall from time to time receive from us, or the Agent and Council at Gombroon, who have our Directions to give you their best advice and assistance, whenever necessary. 2 l5r .—Your utmost abilities and attention must on all occasions be exerted to promote the consumption of the British Woolen Manufacture at92 Bunderrieck, which is the Chief reason of your being employed there. In order therefore be careful to make yourself well acquainted with the sortments, that are most proper for that market and frame your indents to Gombroon accordingly. 317, Large sales, though at a moderate profit will always meet with the Hon'ble Company's approbation, you are therefore to take all proper methods to hinder the merchants from dealing in Erench or any other Foreign Woolen Manufacture, and likewise to discourage the Aleppo Adventurers from dealing in these Commodities as much as possible. 4iy # —No consideration whatever, will be deemed sufficient to warrant your lending goods or money to the Government upon the Hon'ble Company's account, and all your bargains with the merchants must be for ready money only, receiving the amount of the goods before they are delivered. Hereby all bad Debts and disputes will be effectually prevented. 51^—Embrace all opportunities of advising the Agent and Council at Gombroon, with the state of affairs under your direction, transmitting an account of your sales, remains in Warehouse, and Ballance of cash, by every Conveyance, you must avoid keeping any quantity of money by you, but embrace every good opportunity that offers for conveying it to Gombroon. 6 ly .—As it will be for the Hcn'ble Company's Credit and Honour, and a means of alleviating their expences, to collect customs at Bunderrieck, you must ensist on this Priviledge from the Shaik or Governour, and we hereby empower you to levy a duty upon all Imports and Exports by People trading under the Hon'ble Company's Protection, in the same manner. As at Gombroon, of which a particular account must be annually sent thither agreeable to the practice of the Resident at Bussorah. 7 ly .—Upon your arrival at Bunderrieck the Purpose of your coming must be notified to the Shaik or Governour, in the plainest and openest manner that no disputes may arise hereafter through misunderstanding, and all Controversy whether with the Government or Dutch, who have now a great Influence in the Gulph, must be carefully avoided, and as we do not at present think it necessary or advisable that the Hon'ble Company should have any Dead Stock at this place, you are to hire one of the most commodious Houses in the Town unto which may be added such conveniences of repairs as in moderation may appear requisite, so that the Hon'ble Company's goods and servants may have a safe and proper lodging. We wish you success in this undertaking and are Your Loving Eriends, RIOHAED BOTTRCHIER. HUGH SYMMONS. WILLIAM SEDGW1CKE. THOMAS BYEELD. BRABAZON ELLIS. WILLIAM HORNBY. WILLIAM ANDREW PRICE.

In our address by the Experiment Snow we informed your Hon. etc., of the battle between Nasseir Caun and Ally Caun Shahesmand (one of Carem Caun's Officers) since which time there has been another engagement between p ositioilo{ tbe them when Nasseir Caun was again defeated and obliged to retreat to Lhor rival parties in ^ where he is at present and as he has only a small body of troops with him he is of Karim Khan's unable to take the field so that Ally Caun Shahesmand lays the towns and officerB ' villages under heavy contributions and has wrote the Agent of his design to beseige Lhor.

Agent and Council at Gombroon to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors for affairs of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies. M ay it please your H onours, We paid our last bumble respects to your honours under date the 10th October at the same time we forwarded its Duplicate to Bussorah directing the Resident there to desire his Majestie's Consul at Aleppo to forward them by different Conveyances,— On the 28th Ultimo imported a Dutch Ship from Batavia but last from Bombay, she brought us the enclosed packet for your Honours, which we have hired Cossids to carry it to Bussorah directing the Resident to forward with the utmost expedition. Since our last address we have received no further supply of Woolen Goods from Bombay and our superiors under the 10th October last acquaint us it not will be in their power to send us any till the arrival of the Edgecote and Houghton from England. Agreable to what we wrote your Honours under the 10th October we loaded on the Warren Ketch one thousand two hundred Maunds (1,200 mds. Carmenia Wool and dispatched her to Bombay the 11th, our remains at present of this Article is three thousand two hundred forty Maunds (3,240 mds.) and we shortly expect a further quantity from Carmenia of seven hundred fifty Maunds (750 mds.), our remittances to Carmenia on account this year's Invest ment is upwards of sixty nine thousand Rupees (09,000 Rs.) from whence we flatter our selves we shall be able to give your Honours Content, We have likewise sent to Carmenia for the provision of the next years Crop Rupees five thousand (Rs. 5,000) We shall be glad to see a Vessel from Bombay with you Honours' Consignments of Woolen Goods for this Agency and hope she will arrive us 'eer the Cold weather is over as few merchants are here in the heats should our superiors send us one of your Honour's Charter ships it will give us an opportunity of forwarding to Bombay our large remains of old copper as likewise what Carmenia Wool we may have ready. We have enquired regarding the Imbost Cloths in Carpets, and find they will not answer at present, the Dutch have had some for this long time in their Factory and though they offer them at three Rupees a yard they are unable to dispose of them they are two Guz broad; but should we find here after they are likely to turn to account we shall not fail of advising your Honours, we have directed our Resident at Bussorah to acquaint us whether they will sell there. Accounts from Spahaun mention that Azad Caun left that place in October last for Farse and that he has an army with him of Forty seventhousand men, he wrote the Agent a letter last September from Casbin advising that he was then on his march towards Spahaun, where he proposed staying only five Days and then proceed to Shyrash, Nasseir Caun has acquainted the Agent that five thousand of Azad Caun's Soldiers are coming to his assistance. By letters received from Carmenia the 23rd Ultimo we learn that Ahmed Shaw is returned to Oandahar, and it's reported that he has left with Sharrook Shaw at Musshad five thousand five hundred offghoon Soldiers. It s reported that Fattally Caun with a large body of Troops is arrived near Shyrash which obliged Carem Oaun to order Ally Caun Shahesaman to return thither and that he left Lhor the beginning of last month, the towns and villages that were dependant on Nasseir Caun, he has ravaged in in a terrible manner. Our last advices from Nasseir Caun were received the 9th Ultimo, he writes that Patally Caun with fifteen thousand men was soon to leave Spahaun for Shyrash and that Azad Caun was shortly to follow with an army of fifty thousand, that when he arrives he will lay waste the territories of such people as join'd Carem Caun, that he has received orders from Azad Oaun to have in readiness fifty thousand Horse Shoes, so that if these forces come to Parse your Honours will easily judge how much the Inhabitants will be oppressed. Your Honours have been already advised of Moolah Ally Shaw's besieging Loft which at last has surrendered to him, intirely owing to the Death of Abdul Shaik, on his return to this place he raised a tax on the Multanny and Banksally Merchants of Eupees three thousand (Rs. 3,000) to give to the Arabs who joined him. We duely acquainted your Honours of Mr. Wood's leaving this place in March last for Bunderick, but instead of proceeding thither agreable to his Instructions from the Presidency he stayed at Busshire and made proposals to Shaik Nasseir for settling there but when he came to talk about our Collecting Customs on all Goods Imported &amp; Exported by the English he would not Consent thereto unless he was paid an annual Sum of Rupees one thousand five hundred (Rs. 1,500) in Consideration thereof, and as Shaik Nasseir bears the Character of a designing Man and regards no one but for Wood's attempt to the sake of what he can fleece them of. We wrote Mr. Wood that he ought ifproce^toopen first to have proceeded to Bunderick and that if he had found it impracticable Bi 5 ( I orj A a r t a ® andar . or unadvisable to settle a Eactory there that he might then have tried Busshire tio V Rogom P fi 0 o S m and that we would have him still see what could be done at Bunderick, settling a f^otory agreeable to these orders he proceeded thither in June, and advises us under th0re ' the 9th August that on his arrival he found the place destitute of Marchants ; and that Meer Hossan the Governor was upon the point of departing for Shyrash, but that he deferred his Journey for three days and very freely granted all priviledges that our Superiors directed him to demand without making the least objection but fearing the bad appearance of his affairs might induce Mr. Wood to return and settle at Busshire he made him promise not to do so before he came back from Shyrash, and he was certain the credit of the English would very soon draw all the Merchants back again to Bunderick and restore the place to its former flourishing condition, these encouragements and the general affection the Merchants have for Bunderick in preference to all other ports in the Gulph on account the good Climate and Convenient Situation for Caffilas from Spahaun as well as the northern provinces of Persia made Mr. Wood conceive great hopes of establishing an96 advantagious Settlement for the vend of British Manufactures, and he says he does not doubt of its answering in the end tho* he fears it will be some time first, afler Meer Hossan's departure for Shyrash the Arabs were so insolent that Mr. Wood was oblig'd to leave the place and proceed to Bussorah were he stayed till July and as Meer Hossain was not returned from Shyrash he went to Busshire where he proposed staying until Meer Hossain might come back and reassume the Government, but his having obtained a ro^om from Carem Caun for settling a Factory at Bunderick he proceeded thither the 9th September and by his letter of 23rd of the same month he acquaints us that his arrival gave the Inhabitants much Satisfaction, but that he had not been a sufficient time to make his arrival know to the Inland Merchants. He has Indented to us for eighty Bales of broad Cloth and seventy of Perpets, which we acquainted our Superiors of desiring they would supply him, as we had not the sortments in Ware house and they have acquainted us it was not in their power to comply therewith till the arrival of the Edgecote and Houghton from England when we might be assured of their doing it by the first proper Conveyance as nearly as they were able. We beg leave to assure your Honours that since Mr. Kniphausen's arrival in the Gulph we have kept a watchful Eye on his proceedings to prevent any encroachments on your Honour's priviledges in this Kingdom, and should he have any designs that way we hope it will be in our power to prevent him. As the Resident at Bussorah from his near Situation to Garack is able to give Your Honours a perfect account of the proceedings of the Dutch we have constantly directed him to be very full on that head and hope he has from time to time not omitted it. Nothing further occurring at present, We beg leave to subscribe our selves with great deference and respect. May it please your honours, Your most faithful and most obedient humble Servants, ALEXANDER DOUGLAS. JOHN PARSONS. G oombroon ; 2nd December 1755. Gombroon, Letters from.

Imported our Hon'ble Master's Ship Houghton Captain Richard Walpole, from Gombroon by whom We received advices from the Agent and Council there bearing Date the 24th Ultimo, and owning the receipt of our commands of the 10th October, since tlieir last address Warren likewise those of the 12th December &amp; 3rd Jany. They then mentioned the arrival of Shipping at their Fort. That they had informed on enquiry the sale of Imboss Cloths in carpets would no ways answer at their markets, and had advised the Hon'ble Company accordingly. That they had directed Messrs. Wood &amp; Shaw to inform them what Vend they promised at their places and the former97 had requested musters without which he could not explain the nature of the cloths to the merchants. That as their Linguist at Carmenia received the wool in very small quantities and made the merchant advances accordingly, adjust ing their accounts annually. It would be impossible for them to transmit an accot. current by every conveyance. That the amount of their remittance to him for last year's Crop was 74,000 Rupees. That they had not been able to supply him with any money for the provision of this year's crop, having no silver ^ Eupees, which was the only coin the merchants there wou'd accept, and it ( having been out of their power to negotiate Bills of Exchange in regard to which they wou'd in future observe our directions of the 10th October. That our consignt. per Houghton turned out agreeable to invoice, which ship they now despatched to us having laden on her wool and copper amounting to Shahees 1620, 987, as per invoice and bill of Jading enclosed. They informed us the same troubles still subsisted in Persia, and particularized the success of the several Competitors for that Empire. That no inland Merchants of any great substances were then there, but they wou'd on their arrival shew them the Seiges and advise us whether they wou'd answer. That Mr. 'Wood had according Mr ' Wood had to our directions, which they had communicated to him began to settle at Bandar^ig^ 16 ** Bunderick, where he had been received very kindly. That by a calculate they had received from him his monthly expences would amount to 300 Rupees &amp; that he had charged on account of his passage from Bombay 6,935 Shahees relative to which they requested our orders. That the detachment of soldiers for Bunder ike proceeded thither on the Ali Booha Grab. That they learnt by the Prince Edward, Mr. Shaw had lately had some disputes with the Government at Bussorah in Consequence of which, he had pro ceeded to Bagdad in company with the French Resident, where they heard of his safe arrival, but that he had not on his departure, given Mr. Garden whom he left on board the Neptune any orders to remit the balance of his Cash or annual Accounts to them. That they had not received lately any public advices, from him but that he mentioned in a private letter dated the 26th December, he had not then heard any news from Aleppo. They further added no Europe advices had reached Bussorah the 29th January when the Prince R tb . Edward left that place. That since Mr. Shaw's departure from Bussorah, the 1'utch factory at Dutch had re-establish fid their Factory there at the request of SAyman Bassa. Sspatoh of copy That they had duely forwarded our two Europe packets &amp; now sent in a an^PhfrLauads. separate Box, copy of translation of their grants &amp; Phirmaunds. That the Commission received from the Mayor's Court had been duely executed. They further advised the death of Mr. Parson's and the return of Ensign Henny, and their armourer and that they enclosed sundry papers as per list of the packet.

The Letter to the Agent &amp; Council at Gombroon acknowledged the receipt Goinbroon LetteE of their advices per Houghton with translate of their Grants &amp; Phirmaunds. ^ ^ d That tho' for the reasons they assigned it may not be in their power to receipt o/Grants transmit by every conveyance, a general accot. of their wool investment, yet and Phlri,lannds '98 we enjoined the Compliance with our orders as often as possible. That we were informed they refused accepting a sum tendered by Capt. Baillie, on account Mr. Seeker's estate &amp; giving him bills, tho' at the same time they in- Satisfaction ^ formed us our directions on that head shou d be observed and they owned obtaining rogom themselves in want of silver Rupees to advance for the Wool investment. We Banda^Ei^ mentioned our satisfacrion at Mr. Wood's having obtained a rogom from Careem Caun for settling at Bundereek and the reception he met with there. We re commended to them to regulate with the strictest frugality his expences and as the sum charged for his passage was exorbitant, they must enquire into the circumstances that occasioned it, and if the account prove satisfactory, discharge it, that we must await further information from them before we cou'd form any judgement relative to Mr. Shaw. That we shou'd by the conveyance comply with their indents, We advised in regard to Jacques Charles Hermet, agreeable to Consultation of the 23rd ultimo and directed them to forward the accompanying packet to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors, likewise to advice them of everything material as well relative to Mr. Shaw, as the Dutch re-establishing their factory at Bussorah. Despatched per boat a letter to the Chief at Fort Victoria, advising our then complying with his sevl. indents, but desired he would in future give us earlier notice, in regard to the provisions, as a boat was not always immediately procurable. LXXVI. From— F iuncis W ood , Resident at Bunderick, to A lbxander D ouglas , Agent &amp; Council at Gombroon. Eight Worshipful Sir &amp; Sirs ; Conformable to your W 0 &amp;c^, permission I have began to build a house for the Hon'ble Company's servants at this place, and shall be particularly carefull regarding the expenee as well as the Compleatness of the work, tho' by means of the Dutch who employ all the poor people they can get in Constructing Hummums, Houses, and Carravanseroys at barrack, I find a good deal of difficulty in getting Labourer but when the reapers return from the Harvest I hope soon to finish the Business, of which your W2, &amp;ci shall be timely advised, and as the present troubles in the Country render the place very unsafe. I beg your W^ &amp;ct won't think of making me any Consign ments till I am in a better Capacity of defending them. The 2* of March I forwarded your packet (which came by the Commander of the Ally Racky Grab) to Bussorah under the care of M^ Roger Shaw, and that sent by the shotter accompanying your commands of the 7th March shall be entrusted to Erancis Walker, who proceeds to Bussorah the 5^ Instant with the most valuable of my Effects which I don't chuse to risk in Bunderick till the Commotions among the neighbouring powers are ili some measure subsided and mercantile affairs also bear a better aspect. I advised your Wa. &amp; ci by the Prince Edward that I shortly proposed spending a few days with the Dutch at barrack, to enable me to speak with more certainty regarding their affairs, in pursuance of which resolution I went over there upon the Neptune Gall'y the 6^ ultimo and did not return till the 15^ after making the f ollowing remarks whirh for the sake of brevitv I s^hall here lay before your W° &amp; C ! l without Confining myself to the fluency of an exact Connexion.99 The day after my arrival I made a tour round the Island with the two Description of the Cap*! of the Dutch Ships and Mynheer Vanderhulst, who sherved me the KnJhausSf ak an&lt;i particular Lands that were allotted for the Chinese, to Cultivate, and &amp; c e a hods of trade ' Confirmed what I had before heard of their intending to settle eighty Families of them upon barrack, when the Arab Inhabitants are all to be sent off. Mynheer Kniphausen constantly employs eight or ten small trankeys with divers (whenever it happens to be a Calm day) in fishing for pearl of which there is great abundance round about the Island, he sends Coffree Slaves in each boat who receive all the oysters the divers take up and deliver them to Mynheer just the same as they come out of the Sea, so that unless a man could be present to see them opened (which is always done in private) there is no judging what success he has in this particular branch. Their Warehouses are full of Goods particularly, Sugar, Sugar Candy, pepper, Eice, Leather, spices of all kinds, Tin Toothenague, Lead, Iron, Perpets of a double breadth and broad Cloth of different sorts. They bring the two last articles in Chests and what I have been able to get a sight of are very improper both in Colour and Fabrick for the Persia Market, tho' having procured the musters of some medley Cloths which Mynheer told me he had Indent'd for, I now enclose them to you, and am very sorry to say they are exceedingly well chosen. The Dutch leave no means untry'd to engross ev ery branch of trade into their own hands, and if an obstinate perseverance in selling their goods at low prices in order to encourage the merchants, and a steady resolution in carrying on Fortifications and Buildings at almost an incredible expence, may be esteem'd parts Conductive to success, they are certainly in a fair way of attaining it, but for my part I could see no trade going on, nor do I believe the place will in any degree answer the Charge they have been at, till Persia comes to be settled, ■when barrack will no doutl;, from the very situation ofit } became a flourishing populous place. As I wrote your Wo (feci, in my last, the Dutch (if there is any credit to be given to what they say themselves) were invited to settle again at Bussorah by the Bashaw, and Vandarhulst and Nicholo went thither for that purpose, but finding the City involved in troubles, the Mussaleem upon the point of being recalled to Bagdat, &amp; no prospect of speedy or advantageous Sales, they thought fit to defer it till a more favourable opportunity. A Hundred Europeans is the established number of Soldiers, allow'd from Batavia for the defence of barrack fort; what I have seen, I take to be about sixty including seven or eight petty officers, and they are all neat handsome fellows, kept under the strickest Discipline, besides these Mynheer Kniphausen has above a hundred Coffree Slaves well armed according to the Country manner with swords and Targets, who from his manner of treating them, are likely to remain faithful and contented under their Bondage, he takes care to supply them with plenty of dates. Fish, and Bread, gives them decent Cloathing, cools the natural Fervour of their Constitution, by allowing a Considerable number of Coffree women to live among them, in Common, and never Controls, or even advises them in regard to Religion, but when they commit a fault, he punishes them very severely, and whenever he has occasion to drab any of the Arabs or Country people he orders two or three of the Slaves to take him in hand, which service seems to be peculiarly adopted to thek Capacity and in my life I never saw people acquit themselves in a duty of this kind with greater dexterity and Judgement100 The Ship Houstendina is certainly intended to be broken up, tho' Mynheer pretends not to have come to any such resolution, the Sails, Topmasts, yards, and running rigging are all taken ashore, and the Commander himself told that he and his officers were to return to Batavia upon the Ship Krabbendyke. The T. Loo Sloop of Ten Carriage and six Swivel Guns, the Dragon Gallivat mounting six three pounders and four Swivels, with three new trankey's are all the marine Force that properly belongs to the Island, and I have done all in my power to learn whither the Dutch really intend to take Possession of Bahreen or not, but can get no intelligence to be depended upon, if they have any such scheme in their heads they are very secret, and will not put it in execution I believe, till the Chinese are well settled at barrack. Inclosed is s plan of barrack Eort, which I had leisure and opportunity of taking to the greatest exactness, as I lodged in it the whole time I stay'd upon the Island, they don't intend to have any wall round the Town, but instead of it a Deep Toss, with draw Bridges, capable of receiving and proving a safe Harbour for the Gallivats and Trankey's. This Mynheer Knipsausen himself told me, he had orders to make, and computed the expence of it would amount to about five &amp; forty thousand Rupees. Hassain Caun Cadjar having driven Ahmed Shaw Ogwan from the province of Mezandroon and Casbin pursued him several days Journey towards Musshad, but receiving advise of Carem Caun Zand's being in possession of Spahaun he immediatly returned, fearing the King, who lay encamped with part of the army between Gelaun and Tauris, might also fall into his Hands. The 20th of March two of his Choppars reached Spahaun with letters advising Carem Caun Zand to evacuate that City and return again to Shy rash, where, provided he would acknowledge Ishmael Shaw for his lawful Soverign 'and do his endeavours in Conjunction with him to settle the Kingdom, he should be ©stablish'd Begler beggy of the hot Countries, but if he refus'd, no favour should be shewn to him or any of his adherents, which Terms being made publick all the Arabs in general and the people of Destastoon (not thro'Loyalty but fear) declared for Ishmael Shaw, and Carem Caun Zand finding himself thus deserted by the only people he depended upon, left the City with about eight hundred veteran Soldiers as soon as Hassain Caun Cadjar's advance guards approached the Village of Harrand, which was on the 27* March, and the 10* last month he arrived at Sbyrash, where he is now preparing to invade Dastastoon and the Countries adjacent in revenge for the peonies Treachery, but holds his Hand for the present to see what turn affairs may take at Spahaun. The 1^ April Hassain Caun Cadjar entered Spahaun and was so far from treating the Arabs as they expected, that he suffered his soldiers to strip and plunder them of all they had, Shaik Nassier of Busshier remains in prison, the Caun having insisted on his rendering an account of the Kings Ships and paying also 5,000 Tomaunds for the last three years' revenues of Bahreen, but Meer Hossain and his Brother Manna in Consideration of their known poverty were permitted to return, which Journey they perform'd on foot in Company with Kiad Kydar (Shaik of the Coast between this^place and Cape Dillom) and a vast number of the Busshier people, they arrived here the 20* ultimo, when being quite bare of provisions, Cloaths and money I was obhg'd to make tbem a present Consisting chiefly of Rice aild piece ds to the amount of near three hundred and sixty (360) Rupees, whieh I assure your101 Wo. &amp;C* was not only necessary but quite unavoidable. If your Wo &amp;c* when you supply the soldiers with arms could spare a Couple Barrels of fine Gunpowder, and a dozen of Europe Padlocks, as also a thousand or fifteen hundred Flints they would be very Convenient, these particulars being very seldom to be got for money in this place. So long as the Shotters have remained here they have been allow'd two Shahees a day for their provision, the reason of my detaining the two that first arrived was the hopes I was in of their proving Serviceable in overseeing the Bricklayers and Carpenters employed in Building, and now upon their departure I have advanced each of them five rupees for their Travelling expences.

The 8^ ultimo a letter from Baron Kniphauson cautioning me to be aware of the impending danger, for that he himself had at last come to a Resolution of Chastising the Meer and I might expect Bunderick to be involved in troubles very suddenly, upon reading this I immediately began to Consider what other advantage the Dutch could promise themselves from coming to an open rupture with Meer ITossan than preventing an English settlement's being established here, but could find none of any weight or im portance, and recollecting the many low underhand practices they had before made use of to obtain their ends. I began to suspect, and indeed to be very much afraid their intentions against me were bad, therefore I judged it advis able for my own safety to retire from hence for a few days, and return when the storm was over, rather than to attempt the danger of falling into the hands of his people, who are more abjects than slaves, and from the slightest hint would be encouraged to dispatch me, which might have been easily performed in such a manner that my death could be laid to no particular person, the want of arms for my people also was some inducement to my taking that step, as well as the necessity I was in for Timber and Stores to finish the Building, which I was very anxious to have in a posture of Defence before the Dutch party in favor of Shaik Ally Mossoom and Meer Manna might come to a head sufficient to disposses Meer Hassain of the Government, but to my great concern and disappointment, when I returned (which was the day before102 yesterday) I found all their designs fully accomplished, Meer Hassain with several other of my friends were killed and the Company's house almost levelled with the Groundt for this service its currently reported that the Dutch gave Meer Manna two thousand Rupees and Shaik Ally Mossoom having also received twelve hundred Rupees and four Sharols from them, sent his people and struck the English Colours (which I had ordered the Corporal to hoist in my absence) and had it not been publickly known that I had carried all my valuable effects away with me to Bussorah my Carravansery would certainly have been plundered by the Arabs, Meer Manna in Conjunction with a pack of drunken Idle wretches who were his accomplices both in the murder of hi s Father and Brother, are the persons under whose petty Tyranny this village is 'now oppressed, and from their loose indiscreet behaviour, there is no reason to doubt that Revolution will soon happen, tho' having provided myself at Bussorah with arms for the soldiers I am in hopes to defend my Habitation if attacked or at least to retreat from the place without any Considerable Loss, more than what has been already sustained, from their demolishing the Hon'ble Company's House. Thus I have fully made known to your W 0 ^ &amp;ci the cause of my late voyage to Bussorah and also the present state of the Government at this place, Carem Caun is in daily apprehention of Hassan Caun Cadjar's surrounding him in Shyrash and Meer Hassan being killed, I have now no further prospect of success in this undertaking, as the Dutch by the force of their presents are able to do just what they please with Meer Manna, I must therefore beg your 'W° &amp;c* speediest orders in regard to my further proceeding, for the people look upon me to have been, in some degree, the occasion of Meer Hossain's death, and I ? really believe he would not have come to so untimely an end, had he not been a man of too much obstinacy to break his promise with me tho' the Dutch did all in their power to seduce him.

S ir, On the 21^ came to hand your letter of the 29^ ultimo, and is given me great concern to find that the troubles at Bunderick prevented your taking on shore the Consigoment of Woolen Goods and Tin ^ Ship Betsey, as from our former advices to this Agency had the place being in a state of tran quillity an advantageous sale for our Hon'ble Masters might have been expected. I observe your greatest motive for going to Bussorah was on the receipt c (i t f w of a letter from Mynheer Kniphansen, who no doubt wants to engross the b leaving Bunder ^ trade of Bunderick and Busshire to himself wherefore our having a settlement ^iiianimoM. 88 at either of those places can't be agreeable to him and as much you might expect he would fling all the obstacles in his power in your way to prevent it and give you frequent alarms, tho' I see no reason whatever that should induce him to attempt your life which you seemed apprehensive of when you proceeded to Bussorah, nor do I perceive by your advices that any violence was committed on the people you left behind, therefore I think that if your apprehensions had not be so great and that you had stay'd at Bunderick, communicating to Meer Hassain the advices which from time to time you might get of the designs his Brother or Dutch had against him, in all probability he might have avoided the fatal stroke which happened to him when our Hon'ble Master's House would have been secure, besides I much doubt whether the Arabs would have demolished the House had you been present, but finding it was left in charge of only a corporal they had the less restraint on them. The want of arms for the military and Timber and stores for finishing the house ought io have been no inducement for your leaving Bunderick, as you104 until orders are received from the Preeidency. had indented hither for the arms which were sent you by the first vessell that Bailed hence after its receipt, and you could have applied to the Resident at Bussorah to have procured and sent you on the Hon'ble Company's account such materials as you stood in need off. „ . „ As the Hon'ble the President and Council direct that everv nroner He should not leave j-iiiip i- again the place expedient be tryed for making a settlement at Bundenck and conceive great hopes from the promises you formerly wrote were made you by several mer chants at Bussorah, as also you having wrote hither that you doubted not, but it would answer the Hon'ble the President and Council's expectations shall not give any directions for your quitting Buuderick untill I receive their further orders on that head, nor would I have you take such a step unless you apprehend your and the peoples lifes in danger, or something very material happens that I can't at present foresee. You ought to represent to Meer Manna the advantages it will be to Bunderick our Hon'ble Masters having a settlement there, on the other Hand that he may depend the Hon'ble the President and Council of Bombay will take satisfaction for any insults offered the Hobble Company or their Servants. As Hossain Caun Cadjar is now in this Kingdom with a large army and having taken possession of Spahaun some time past and now besieging Shyrash a revolution may soon be expected, and if his designs are to keep possession of the Country he will undoubtedly appoint proper persons to reduced these petty Shaiks to his obedience and give encouragement to all merchants whatever and then it may not be in Meer Manna or the Dutch their powers to give any obstructions, a little time will show, is real Inten tions. It's currently reported here that Meer Manna on your return to Bunderick from Bussorah made an offer of rebuilding the house at his own expence which, if true, I am surprized to find no mention made thereof in vour advices. ^ I am.

That their Carmenia Linguist had to that time been advanced to 62,507, Shahees, from whom the Agent learnt that the Dutch Vakeel at Oarmenia, had promised to give ten Shahees per Md. more than him, which would inhance the price and convince the Persians that Article was much wanted in Europe. That the Eesident at Bundereek advised that the Dutch had imported great quantities of all sorts of goods at Carrack but that their woolen goods were improper for the market, except some nedleys which were well chosen. That the troubles in Persia continued, another competitor for the Empire having started up alledging himself the son of Shaw Thomas. That the Resident at Bundereek had communicated some observations he had made when at Oarrack on that settlement, and the Dutch Government, &amp;ca., the particulars of which he related. That the Dutch gave out, that they had 'been invited to resettle to the at Bussorah, hut on the Mussoleem's being turned out fy expecting to Kasrah!^ 10 meet with some difficulty they had declined it. They enclosed a plan of Carrack Port, taken by Mr. Wood during his stay there also copy of a letter from him advising the state of affairs in Bundereek and his apprehensions from, the Dutch on which he as he requested our directions, and the Agent gave it as his opinion that had there been a possibility of handing his consignment of tin, &amp;c., there, advantageous sales wou'd have been made. That the sum offered by Captain Baillie was very small and mostly in gold, which occasioned their refusal of it, not thinking it worth while to beat the charge of sending such a trifle to Carmenia. That, the reason of their not making Jacques Charles Hermit an allowance, was our judging the account charges of being his family from Spahaun very exorbitant, which made them dubious of what sum we meant shou'd be given him. That since the troubles in Persia, many families had been brought from Spahaun &amp; the expences very great, but as in all probability the Agent wou'd want money for other services, he requested we would make him an allowance here. That on inspecting the Uesident at Bussorah's Lre's—to the Ho. Co. It was observed he had under the 27th July 1755 (copy of which Letter was enclosed) wrote them Mr. Wood had express fears of meeting with little success at Bundereek &amp; the preference that shou'd in his opinion be given to a settle ment at JBushire which was absolutely contrary to what Mr. Wood had wroth to Gombroon a few days after on which accot. orders had been sent to both Resident's to assign their reasons for said intimations to the Company, that Mr. W ood had given his answer in the last paragraph of his Letter under the 29th June last (as per copy enclosed) and when Mr. Shaw's answer arrived it should be forwarded for our inspection. Enclosed were sundry papers received from Mr. Shaw, relative to his despute with the Bengali Gentlemen &amp; his Journey to Bagdad. The Agent likewise forwarded by this ship one set of the Diary &amp; Consultation brot. up to the Day. That 15,000 Rupees wou'd be that evening forwarded by Carmenia Linguist &amp; the A^ent hoped, not with- standing the Impedimts. from the Dutch, to purchase a sufficient quantity of wool. He mentioned, Mr. Pomfret's Death and Mr. Holmes's request to be relieved ; That the Carmenia Linguist had petitioned for leave to build ware houses there for cleaning &amp; securing the wool, having hitherto been obliged to use his own on this accot. on which the Agent requested our directions. That106 Captain Baillie had paid into their Treasury 41,245, Shahees, for which he receiyed Bills and the Agent likewise had given Drafts on us for 46,390 Rupees Value reed, there, the particulars whereof &amp; in whose favour drawn he then advised.

That the Linguist had to that time been advanced 712,507, Shahees, and had delivered 1,680 Maunds. He particularized the quantity of woolen goods and Europe staples he had sold since the 1st August 1755 and assured us his greatest attention should be given to encrease the vend of each. He mentioned the political situation of affairs in Persia and contradicted Mr. Adams's assertion of his not knowing he shou'd proceed so high in the Gulph as Bundereek (in Excuse of his Mr. Adams's refusal of a passage to Mr. Wood, observing that both he and the Commander had declared the Ship was bound to Bussorah and the Agent believed had then on Board some freight Bales for Bundereek). That the Secretary had wrote Mr. Adams a letter in consequence of that gentleman's public declarations Mr. Seeker &amp; Parsons, that Mr. Wood shou'd not go on his Ship. That in obedience to our Commands he shou'd send the Swallow and Drake to demand satisfaction of the Shaik at Congoone, whenever the former returned from Muscat whither the Agent had dispatched her with some Europe Packets received from Bussorah. That he had advised Mr. Wood of his intentions regarding the Drake and Swallow directing him to proceed to Congoone and await their arrival there and likewise permitted him to proceed with those vessels to Bundereek, to reestablish the Factory or obtain satisfaction for the demolition of the Hon'ble Company's House there which step he hoped Mr. Wood's favourable report of the advantages that might accrue to the Company from the trade there wou'd induce us to approve. That not having received Mr. Wood's accounts for July, he cou'd not inform us of the expences he had been at in building a Factory there. That 22,000 Rupees had been remitted him since his arrival at Bundereek, and his Expences to the 81st July 1755 amounted to 2,796 Rupees. That he cou'd not Comply with the Ho Compy.'s orders for sending them a muster of Dutch draps, as the Dutch had then none remaining but wou'd as soon as procurable. That he had recovered the amount of Mr. Parker's Customs Bill and adjusted and received of Caot. Williams the amot. of the Hector's damaged Goods.

LXXX IL Public Department Diary 29, 1756. Bombay Castle, BOth October 1756. The Letter acknowledged the Eeceipt of his advices under the 5th August Letter to 6fch and 29th Ultimo with the Packets, etc., therein mentioned. We expressed our Concern for the ill success Mr. Wood had met with at Bundereek which we imputed to the Underhand Practices of the Dutch, That he Mr. Wood approved, if Wood .1.1. oiiL-i. -r-ii • -i • v cannot establish a was the best judge of the possibility of establishing a Factory there, m which fac tory there or case we wou'd have him persevered in order to extend the vend of woolen goods, but if he cou'd not succeed there nor make a settlement in any other return, part of the Gulph he might as well return. We signified our approval of his directing him to carry the Drake and swallow to Bundereek to demand satisfaction of the Shaik at that place. That we shou'd send a Covenanted servant to the Agent's assistance by the first Conveyance. That we cou'd not permit of his building warehouses at Carmenia, He must therefore continue to rent those belonging to the Linguist, and make him some allowance for the necessary Repairs. That the sales of Europe goods for the last year were very agreeable to us and we relied on his endeavours to promote the vend of the Woolen articles as he wou'd Observe by the enclosed paragraph of our Hon'ble Master's Commands of the 31st March respecting that agency. They had strictly enjoined it. That we should by the first proper opportunity transmit sundry goods, we had received by the Clinton and Eoyal Duke for that market. We observed his inability to send home a pattern of Dutch draps, but took notice that he had not mentioned whether he had found any sort of medley cloths that Mildewea more than others, of which the Hon'ble Company also required patterns. That We had discharged the several bills he drew on us the 5th August &amp; 29th Ultimo, we inform him of the reasons of this vessel's despatch directed him to address the Hon'ble Company and to order the Eesident at Bussorah, to forward the packet for them in the most expeditious and secure manner and that the vessel might be returned to us without Delay. LXXXIIL Francis Wood Alexander Douglas , EsqL., Agent &amp; C A Council at Gombro^m, Bight Wo Sir and Sir's— I am now to answer your Commands of the 24th July, 8th and 14ith of September and 9th and 15th October, which I shall endeavour to do in a plain and concise manner, the principal subject I have fco treat upon being very disagreeable.108 During the time of Meer Hossan's Government at Bunderreek I could hardly have wished for a more favourable prospect of establishing an advan- Meer Mohana'g op- tageous settlement there, which induced me to give your W &lt; l &amp;c . as tabiishaentof 64 we ^ as Hon'ble the President great hopes of success ; but afPairs have factory at Bandar n o W taken a quite different turn under Meer Manna, as I fully represented to you in my advice of the 29«i June, and I am sorry to find myself obliged again, to contradict Mr. Shaw with respect to these matters, for Meer Mahana after the murder of his brother and my flight to Bussorah was so far from inviting me back again or offering to rebuild the Honourable Company's House that he refused to allow me the privilege of Collecting Dutys from merchants trading under the English Protection, unless I would agree to pay him two thousand Eupees a year, and in spight of all my solicitations he constantly employed a great number of labourers in carrying away the materials of the House, to build a Wall round his town to the very day I left the place, had the case been otherwise your Wz &amp;&gt;c* may be assumed I should not have omitted to acquaint you with such material Circumstances; I have taken all opportunities of setting forth the great advantages that would accrue to the Shaik of Bunderreek from our having a settlement, but he is a young indiscreet man wholly given up to the most destructive vices, and so extremely Revengefull that it's dangerous to give him even the slightest occasion of offence, therefore I judged it neither safe nor prudent to interfere so much as with my advice to Meer Hossain, for fear my name should be brought in Question, and as I have not been able to prevail on him to desist from carrying away the ruins of the Company's House, neither by means of presents, nor by conforming to his intemperance in point of Drinking at frequent, nay almost daily visits, I humbly apprehend my presence would not have brought forth the good effects your Wo seem to imagine, and any person that is acquainted with the dangers and Incon veniences attending a voyage from Bunderreek to Bussorah in an open Boat in the month of May, would want but very little persuasion to convince him that I went thither by the strongest impulsions of Necessity. The Bengali Supracargo gave me good reason to believe he could not supply me with Cash, and notwithstanding what Mr. Shaw writes your W^ &amp;ca under the 9th June, I assure you his letter of Credit upon Hodiee Ibrahim for 6,000 Rupees came very unexpectedly, therefore I must beg you Wo not to impute my taking up money of the Dutch to any Disregard of vour orders. &amp; Concerning the purpose of the Drake and Swallow's coming up the Gulph l a T really of p opini I'. that „ thcii :, force is by 1101063118 sufflcieDt * ^0.^1;^ for roJucing Bandar ' ' u P on Consulting the Commanders I And they are not able from both g ' tlle ahi P 910 la nd above 65 or 70 men, and the Town of Bunderreek is situated in such a manner that a larger vessel than our Bombay Callivats can't com within two miles of it, the Meer has also upwards of 500 armed men of hi! own tribe always within an hour's warning, who are tolerable good Soldiers when stationed in houses or behind Walls according to their manner of fighting, but, if I might take the liberty to offer my opinion of the matter I don't esteem it in the least advisable to come to an open rupture with the people of Bunderreek; for the Meer himselt is miserably poor and the Inhabit ants have only salt fish ana Dates to loose, unless we should seize upon a few dol Trankeys and three Callivats belonging to the Meer whereby all our hopes /109 of settling there again would be totally destroyed, and we ourselves should We8l i 0U U . ^ ^ p a |, e ^ jjy completely accomplish what the Dutch have been hitherto so strenuously building a defensi- endeavouring at in oa'der to engross the trade of that Port intirely to them- bIe house, selves, which will certainly be the case provided we are not before hand with them in building a defenceable house for the Hon'ble Company's Servants that may be appointed to reside there. In regard to Shaik fladjar at Congoon, many of the freighters as well as Wood's objection the Commander and officers of the Pasterenia signed an agreement with him pe^tion'agSt 6 *' to share equally all that might be saved, so that what he has done bears in Con s an&gt; some degree an appe arance of Justice, though I can't say that this is my Chiefest objection; but the village lies so straggling, and being extended along the Coast among Date Gardens as far in length as between Alenelham's Point and Mallabar Hill, our Cannonading it from the ships can give the inhabitants but very little annoyance, it also ly's so near the mountains, that in case of landing, the Arabs can easily secure all their valurable Effects in less than half an hour's time, and after destroying a number of innocent People at the hazard of lossing many of our own, we should be obliged to return without any profitable satisfaction, leaving the Arabs so exasperated against us as to prove of very unhappy consequence to those of our nation who hereafter may chance to fall into their hands, these are the Considerations that have prevented me from commencing Hostilities against the Arabs of Bunderreek and Congoon, and I have no more to say on this head, than to hope they may meet with your W z &amp;c^ approbation. 1 intended to have dispatched both these vessels the 8^ instant in com- Expulsion of the pany with the Dragon, and it is with great concern that I now relate to your dar^ig.^ 0 ™ Bam * Wthe unfortunate occasion of my detaining them here so long; The 6^ instant between 10 and 11 at night Meer Manna sent a guard of Arab Soldiers under Shaik Channon to turn me and all the Europeans off shore immediately, who insisted very abruptly on our leaving the place in less than half an hour, without giving any other reasons than that the Meer suspected us to be his Enemies, and although Mr. George Purnell who spoke the Arab Language assisted me in persuading them we were Eriends, yet they would not be prevailed on to let us remain untill morning. I then offered Shaik Channon Forty Rupees if he would send for Hodjee Hossain Saffary the Meambashy of the Tribe a sedate well disposed man but he assured me the Meer's orders were so positive that he and all the Soldiers that came with him run a very great hazard in Parleying with us so long and if we did not depart directly he must oblige us to do it by force, whereupon he ordered his People to surround the Gateway, their matches being ready lighted and then he asked again in a peremptory manner whether we would go or not, when it was thought imprudent to argue with them any longer and we went off directly on board the Dragon, leaving every thing behind us but the cloaths on our backs, as soon as we were gone they disarmed the Topasses, took possession of my effects and carryed off 27 Carraboys of 'Wine, threatening to kill my servant Mahomet if he did not discover my Treasure, after midnight the Meer sent another officer named Bossbooz Zachley, who opened my great Cloaths Chest with the Key of the Gate, he also broke the lock of my writing Desk from whence he stole a Bag containing 700 Rupees in silver, and besides all my stock of Barley, Hay, Firewood, Charcoal, &amp;ca, he Carried away three months' provision that 2578 F. D.110 I had Jaid in for the winter season, consisting of 24 bags of Eice, 40 md®. of Ghee, and 20 md^ of Oil, good part of which I have since recovered. This happened within the first twelve hours after my departure from the Carravansery ; and the next day Meer Manna sent Aga Mahmood to write me and M l Hughes ashore again; but the Arab officer having said many malicious Falsities of me to Mr. Purnell, in the Meer's name, particularly that I had combined with the Dutch to plunder the Town and was not so quiet of Innocent a man as strangers would Imagine from my outward appearance; upon this as well as other Considerations. I did not care to trust myself in his hands again, knowing that in so short a time he could have no substantial reason to think better of me; I therefore detained Aga Mahmood, and desired him to send one of his servants with a Letter to the Meer acquainting him that without orders from your W® &amp;c?, I could not answer returns after receiving such Ill-treatment from him and his soldiers, neither could I answer giving Aga Mahmood his liberty until my money and Goods were restored which I desired might be done with all possible expedition that the ship might not be kept here longer than was necessary; I sent him two Barrels of Gun powder supplied by Captain Bailley, with the best and most Friendly Council I was able to give him, and in ten days I received every thing on board the Swallow that could be conveniently brought off; as near as I can at present recollect, excepting what I mentioned to be stolen the first night; for which I could get no other satisfaction than an offer of the Lives of the two persons who were entrusted with the Charge of my House; but this I looked upon as only a compliment, and therefore did not accept it, resolving to keep Aga Mahmood to oblige the Meer to make good my loss, which I would have persisted in if I had not been well assured that he would rather let him remain in slavery than pay so much ready money, &amp; c ? l , to redeem him, and did not chuse to make bad worse by exasperating the Arabs against us, and detaining the vessels up on so great an uncertainty, however, T am in some hopes of not being so considerable a sufferer as this misfortune seems to threaten; and must beg permission of your Wt &amp;ca, to include the particulars of my losses in my account Current with the Agency; humbly submitting them, to the Candour and Generousity of my Superiors at Bombay. As I intended to depart from hence this Evening in order to pay my Eespect to your Wt &amp;ct i in Person, it is not necessary to add any more to this address; I shall therefore Conclude with assuring you that I am Right Sir and Sirs, Your most obedient humble Servant, FRANCIS WOOD.

SlE, In a letter delivered me yesterday you mention your fears of the Enquiring how a Dutch ingrossing the trade of Bunderick unless the Hon'ble Company build a could be built at defensible house there, you ought to have pointed out to me the methods you Baildar ^ judged most expedient to accomplish the same, the expence you thought might attend building such a house with the annual Charges maintaining, &amp;c^, that I might have represented the same to the Hon'ble the President and Council of Bombay, however, you are now directed to do it. My Superiors in their Commands of the 30th October last are pleased to Orders of Govern- acquaint me that if you were able to continue at Bunderick with a prospect ^o^LXXXiifto of success they would have you persevere in order to extend the rend of be Woolen Goods but otherwise and as you seemed liable to a resque of the Hon'ble Company's Effects as well as your own person, if you thought that you could Establish a factory either there or at any other port in the Gulph you might wait for a more favourable opportunity but if that was not practi cable you might return, you are therefore to let me know whether you can put in execution part of the aforesaid orders. I am, S ir, Your Loving Eriend, ALEXANDER DOUGLAS. Gombroon. December, 5% 1756. LXXXV. Francis Wood to Alexander Douglas , Esqi W oeshippfl S ir, Your Commands of this date has just now been delivered Bander Rig eligible me by the Secretary, which your Worship shall have an immediate Reply to. wWcVt^Dutch By the Hon'ble Company's establishing a secure Habitation, or erect- EngilXdo not be ing a small fort at Bunderick (if the opinion of merchants, and most apparent ^ advantages in point of situation may be depended on,) they would greatly augment the Consumption of the British Woolen manufacture in the North ern parts of Persia, and all their settlements in India might at all times be supplied with Grain and wine upon moderate terms. By such a step the Dutch would be prevented from settling there, which I am well assured they propose to do both on account of Trade and the Convenience of getting pro vision, as in the winter season they have no certain supply from any other Port, they find also that the Persian Merchants are very averse to risking their Goods over thither in Boats, (as in case of a southerly wind) without112 which tbey cannot well go from Busshier; it's an even chance that they are dashed to pieces upon the Rocks; and if we were able to supply them with Goods upon the Continent not a man of them would ever purchase of the Dutch; and their schemes of that Island must of course be totally translated. But the Hpn'ble Company have not (according to the best of my judgement) anything near a sufficient force in the Gulph to render an undertaking of this kind advisable, for notwithstanding the Meer of Bunderick migh make all the fair promises that could be desired, yet his word cannot he depended upon ; and it's hardly to be doubted that he would throw many Impediments in our way through the Instigation of the Dutch before the work is half finished, unless we have, at least such a vessel as the Swallow with 200 able men; and a couple of Callivats properly mann'd to lie in the Eiver; and the Arabs may see that we have power to resent an Injury and Carry on our designs in spight of all opposition ; in which case the Meer would also yield his assistance and the Building be accomplish'd between the months of April and September provided timber and stores were ready prepared and a proper person appointed to oversee and direct the Work. I have already communicated my reasons for leaving Bunderick ; which I still believe to be by far the most proper part of the Gulph to settle in, but even there (while the Kingdom of Persia continues in this state of confusion and Anarchy). I can't pretend to give your Worship any great hopes of advantage, and as the winter is now at hand nothing could be done with regard to settling supposing you had a force equal to what I have mentioned until the latter end of March, as to the expence of building a commodious and defensible house at Bunderick, I think it might be done for twelve or fourteen thousand Eupees; and had not the murder of Meer Hussain un luckily prevented me, I dare say, I should have finished that which I had began for much less ; your W?r &amp; c ? h , will be able to judge of the annual charges of such a factory from my account of Expenses during the time I resided there. I am with the greatest Eespect, Eight Worshpful Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, PR ANCIS WOOD. Gombroon. December 5tJi 1756. Qombjoon, L. from. Abandimment of the prejected ex pedition against Bandar Rig and Congtuu LXXXVI. Public Depabtment Diaby No. 30—1757. Bombay Castle, 6th January 1757. The letter from the Agent was under the Yth ultimo, advising his last respects came per Dragon and on the 27th November his Eec-i of our com mands p. Theenix Sloop which vessel he despatched the next day to Bussorah. He advised his hopes that the gross purchase of Carmenia wool this year wou'd he 10,000 Maunds. That he had to that time received 2,580 Maunds,1,680 of which he forwarded per Rector and the remaining 900 now by the Swallow. That he had remitted the linguist since the 29th of September 32,000 E/upees, ten thousand on account of this years investment and the rest for the ensuing one ; The whole advance on account of this years investment being Shahees 822,307. He mentioned his apprehensions, that a refusal to take the black sort of wool, wou'd be attended with bad consequences, as the Dutch made no exceptions to any colour, and used every means in their power, to engross the whole investment. That no colour in the Medley cloths was particularly subject to mildew, but different colours in different bales, proved damaged. He took notice of what he had found damaged in those rec% by the Eoughton and Rector, That he learnt from Mr. Shaw the Bashau of Bagdad had granted him a Phirmaund to take off the heavy anchorage charge on all ships at Bussoraand the same to the French Resident, who in return had made a present of six thousand Cruz, which imprudence Mr. Shaw was apprehensive, wou'd oblige him to he at the like expense. That he had proposed to the Agent continu ing to levy the same anchorage duty as the Government did till the amount which he hoped to reduce to 4,000 Cruz, was discharged, in reply to which, the Agent had informed him he should write for our directions. He enclosed Mr. Shaw's answer, respecting what he wrote the Hon'ble Company about Bunderika, also Mr. Wood's Letter, advising his Reasons for not demanding satisfaction of the Shaiks of Congoon &amp; Bundereke; who having no further hopes of making any settlement in the Gulph returned with Mr. Hughes in the Swallow. The Mr. Wood in his Account Current with the Agency had charg'd 10,069 shashees for the losses he sustained when he was forc'd from Bundereke A . ccount s between the allowing of which sum he referred to us; That on comparing the said Account with the Books of the Agency, he found that he had only given Bussorah Residency credit for 4,000 Rupees, whereas Mr. Shaw had debted Bundereke Factory for 6,000. That he had called upon Mr. Wood to account for the deficiency and enclosed bis answer. That the linguist had examined the Persian writing mentioned therein, and found by the indorsement, the Ree. of only 4,000 Rupees acknowledged : That the Agent had informed Mr. Wood of the Paragraph of our Commands under 30^ October, and as in his letter, under the 18 th following He expressed his fears, that the Dutch would engross the whole trade of Bundereke unless the Hon'ble Company wou'd build a defensible House there. The Agent had enquired of him the best method to be taken for that purpose, whose answer he enclosed, also an invoice and Bill of lading for Sundries shipt on the Swallow amounting to Shahees 150,263-3. That the Bundereke detachment of soldiers returned by this conveyance. LXXXVII. Pdblic Dept. Diary No. SO—1757. Bomlay Castle, 13th December 1757. Imported the Dragon Captain Richard Moore, from Bussorah and Gombroon by whom received a Letter from the Agent at the latter place, Letter dated the 23rd ultimo, advising that the wool Investment went on so well that Mulla Ali Shaw he was in hopes this year gross Purchase wou'd be twelve thousand Maunds, feave Gombroo^for of which he had then received 3,570, which added to his last Years Remains iriS and 0tlier 257 8 F. D.114 made 7,800 Maunds ready to send hither. That the Eesident at Bussorah had sent him on the Dragon Rupees 63,980, which not being enough for his various demands, he had taken up of sundry persons, the sum of Rs. 25,750-0-0 and hoped soon to procure what further sum might be necessary, as without ready money, he could make but little progress in the wool investment. That by his Calculate of Quick Stock, we shou'd be informed of his Remains, and those of Broad Cloth and Perpets being so triffling made him impatiently ^expect the arrival of the Prince Edward which he hoped wou'd take away all the wool as he was much straitned for warehouse room. That Babehoun had submitted to Carem Caun, who was returned to Shyrash, to go 'twas said against Yezd and (if Hossan Caun did not send an Army to Spahaun) to Carmenia. That Nasseir Caun had taken Homady and Shimiel, and was on his return to L'hor, which it was reported Carem Caun intended to attack and the Nasseir Caun had assurred the Agent, he had not the least intimation of any such design, yet it was the general opinion, the Peace said to be made between him and Carem Caun wou'd not be lasting. That on the Caun's arrival at Hamady, Moolah Ally Shaw, and his son-in-Law went to Ormuse and obliged the principal inhabitants to go to the Islands when they still remained, and tho' he had often promised, to give the Caun 1,000 Tomands &gt;nd two brass cannon, yet he had not done it, nor did he seem to have anv intentions of ever doing it, which had so disgusted the Caun, that it was to be feared, if he cou'd lay hold of Moolah Ally Shaw, he wou'd treat him severely as well' as the inhabitants, for quitting the place, after he had given them assurances of treating them well. That by the last accounts Ahmed Shaw was returned to Candahar, and had ordered 40,000 Of goon families to remove to Hiraut, where he intends going to reside in March next. He enclosed Copy of Sundry Papers he had received from Mr. Shaw relative to Mr. Baldrick acknowledged receipt of ours of the 28ta October, and requested some Gunnies and Stationery Ware by the first Conveyance.

The Gentlemen of that Committee for the present Season are Roger Drake, Peter Godfrey, Oristopher Burrow, John Payne and Jones Raymond Esquires. 4. Being determined to send as early as possible the full amount of yours as well as the Bussorah indents, We now consign to you on the Hector as large a part thereof as she can carry, the remainder if there shall be any will be sent to Bombay to be forwarded from thence by such conveyance as the Governor and Council shall think fit.

Upon comparing this account therefore with the Heotors Invoice you will know what may be expected by the way of Bombay. 5. We shall depend upon your utmost Diligent in disposing of the said Consignments and to the best advantage and your constant care and attention to take every favourable opportunity for encouraging and promoting this advantage as well as national branch of our commerce and in particular by getting the best information you can whether any, and what further channels can be found out for extending the import of woolen goods into Persia or the neighbouring country to the Persian Gulph and by communicating the same as well as to the President and Council of Bombay. 6. It being observed that some sorts of medley Cloth are more liable to mildew than others you must send it for our information, patterns of such as you find more particularly under that circumstance. 7. You must be careful to transmit to us by every opportunities an exact list of remains of every article woolen goods, with their value, as likewise your indent as an early information of these particulars are extremely material for making the necessary provision of goods for your markets. 8. We observe there is an unusual quantity of drab remaining for which no reason is given, you must be very particular in regard to the woolen Trade, and by every conveyance acquaint us, if there are any objections made to the Quality, Colours or any other particulars, which We shall endevour to prevent. 9. The three Bales of drab now sent have been made as near as possible to that which the Dutch send both in quality and list, let us know by the first opportunity how it is approved of. 10. Send by this ship a quarter of a yard with the List on of the drab imported by the Dutch the best sort you can procure, and let us know the price. 11. We have sent a few horse cloths, carpets and cushions of imbost cloth of different colours and sizes ; when you have shewn them to the mer chants, let us know whether they are approved of, and what^objections if any, and what quantity of each sort you think will sell. 12.

We hope you will be able to forward to Bombay by this conveyance a good proportion of the Oarmenia Wool which may have been provided in consequence of the Order you repeatedly receive from the Presidency, and We recommend to your attention the purchasing to the utmost of your orders any Quantities of this commodity whenever it to be procured at reasonable prices. 16. Since writing the beforegoing, We have received through the hands of Mr. Drummond at Aleppo, Your Letter of the 27th of December 1754 and 6th of March following, as likewise our Resident Shaw's Letter dated at Bussorah the 20th of May and 27th of July last. One of the packets now received Mr. Drummond informs us was accidently found in the Desart and brought to an imperial subject who came along with the Caravan, which arrived at Aleppo on the 30th of November last, whence he concluded the messenger had died or been killed upon the road. This accident led us to the observa tion made in the 1st paragraph and although you are excused thereby from neglect, yet We expect the directions therein given are carefully and punctually complied with. . 17 - Hostilities are still carried on between the British and Prench nation Amerioa His Marty's ship* continue to take there as well as in Europe all the ships of that nation they meet with, by way of reprisal great numbers of which now lay in the several ports of His Majesty's dominions, but none are yet condemned ; The Prench are using their utmost diligence to fit out a great Marine Force, and are drawing down to the Sea Coasts numbers of their Troops with which they threaten an invasion. The British nation on the other hand was never better prepared to baffle their attempts as well as protect its honour and trade than at this time both by land and sea. Nothwithstandin^ an this no Declaration of War is made by either nation, no Commissions for privateers or letters of Marque have been issued or granted here nor are We informed that any have been issued on the Part of Prance. All British Merchant Ships were suffered to go in and come out of their Ports without any hindrance or molestation until the end of the last month, when it is said all the English vessels at Dunkirk (about nine smaU ones in the whole) were stopped, but we do not hear whether the like has been done in the other ports of that kingdom, or that they have made any other reprisals in Europe since the commencement of the present differences. It cannot well be imagined that affairs will remain long in this situation therefore in all events you must stand well upon your guard; and you are to give such informations to the commander of the Hector if any occur, as may be necessary for the safety of the ship and cargo in her passage from Gombroon to Bombay. Pi a117 18. Since writing the beforegoing, advices have been received, that the French King's orders were published at Dunkirk, for all British subjects to quit his dominions before the 1st of next month, except such as may obtain his permission to remain, another Edict was published inviting his Subjects to fit our privateers, promising a premium of forty livres for every gun, and as much for every man they take on board our ships, with a further promise, that in case peace should be concluded soon, the King will purchase the said Privateers at their prime cost. We are, Your Loving Friends, HENRY SAVAGE and others. London ; 11th Felruary 1756. LXXXIX. From the Court of Directors to the Agent and Council at Gombroon. 1 'We write to you last season under date of the 11th of February I'ZSG by ' t Agent aad the Hector, since which time we have received your several Letters together Council at with those from Our Eesident at Bussorah as follows, viz.* Gombroon of the peSia. 24th June and 16th of August 1755, the 5th of January and 7th of March J^ 831116 sub3eets 1756. From Bussorah of the 17th of August and 27th November 1755, dupli- No - i ^ xxviii . cate of one without date, supposed to have been written the latter end of the March, and the 7th of June 1756. 2. The President and Council at Bombay have sent us Copies of several letters, the originals of which they advised had been transmitted to you to be forwarded to us by the way of Aleppo, some of which were upon matters of the highest import, but as none of them are come to our hands by that channel we are very apprehensive they have been intercepted by the French. We cannot likewise avoid being in pain for fear the dispatches sent as well from His Majesty's Ministers as Ourselves immediately upon the Declaration of War against France, may have also fallen into their Hands; the last Advices from Mr. Drummond informing us that so long a term had intervened between his forwarding them to Bussorah and the date of his Letter, without his having heard anything from thence, as might reasonably be expected; that he was in doubt whether they have not miscarried, or been likewise intercepted, by the enemy. 3. Mr. Drummond at Aleppo has assured Us he will make all the necessary enquiries into the reason of these miscarriages or interceptions and will do every thing in his power to prevent them in future. Our resident at Bussorah must do the same and give us an account of his Proceedings herein. 4. You are not to be discouraged however in sending as friendly as possi ble, all such packets as shall be transmitted you from our Presidency of 2578 F D118 Bombay or elsewhere, and your own advices together with those from Bussorah, but you are to be very cautious in such advices that nothing be inserted therein that occasion any prejudice to^the company, in case of their being intercepted and you are also to give the Resident at Bussorah directions of extremely careful to employ none but the most trusty Messenger. 5. Erom the information we gave you in your letter of Season, an Open War between the British and French Nations might easily be foreseen, it has proved so in the event. His Majesty having proclaimed War against France on the 18th of May last which was returned in a very short time after on the Part of the French King, some of His Majesty's Declarations are now sent for your Information, not but we hope you will know long before this reaches your by the Dispatches sent immediately overland by His Majesty's Ministers and ourselves or if they have miscarried by the Triton Man of War and our own ship the Prince Renry Packet, the first of which left England on the 17th July bound to the Mallabar Coast and the other the 5th of August for Fort St. George, both charged with the news of the important Event to be communicated to all our settlements in India. 6. The French have prepared a great armament at Port L'Orient, and have embarked a Number of Regular Troops the whole being Destined as there js the greatest reason to believe for the East Indies, the necessary advices thereof have been sent to our several Presidencies in order for their being on their guard the part you are to act for the security of that part of our Estate which is or shall fall under your management, must greatly depend upon the advices and orders you may receive from Bombay and your own prudence and we shall accordingly expect that you take such measures as are the most likely to answer the desired purpose. 7. Should you by this oonveyance or at any time hereafter, receive any orders or directions from the Secret Committte for the time being you are to pay the same regard to them as if they were signed by the Court of Directors The Gentlemen who compose that Committee at present, are, Peter Godrey' John Payne, Christopher Burrow, Roger Drake, and Jones Raymond, Esquires any Three of whom are a Quorum. 8. We herewith transmit for your Information Lists of the ships taken into our Service for the several Parts of India this Season, and of the Arrival and Departure of Our Shipping. 9. That you might have an early supply of the Goods proper for the Persia Market, we have ordered the P to be got ready sooner than the other Bombay ships, and do now accordingly consign her to you with a Cargo agreeable to the accompanying Invoice and Bill of Lading consisting principaHy of about five hundred and Fifty-nine Bales of Cloth and Long Ells and some few other particulars for Gombroon and for Bussorah about seventy nine Bales of Cloth and Thirty two Bales of Long Ells. 10.

The Drap Cloths Invoiced at £14-10-6 and £12-19-6 the half Clotbs are of a New fabric, and appear equal, to the sort of the Dutch used to bring to Persia, which sold for about one hundred and sixty shahees per Guz, you must be very particular in the sale of these, and we hope the prices will be muoh advanced as great care has been taken to make the List the same as theirs as well as the Cloth, You must inform us if there should be any differ ence in the Quality of the Cloth or List, and send Us Patterns every year of what they Import and the Prices they sell for. 12. With respect to the Cloth Neftees, you are to send us the particular account whether the Colour, is liked or not, the price the cloth sells for and of such other remarks as occur which may be material and necessary for our information. 13. You are to be very careful and particular in making the Indents for Woolen Goods, and to send Patterns every year of the Colours most liked in the different Sortments of Cloth. 14. We shall depend upon your care and attention in disposing of the Consignments to you by this Ship to the best advantage, as well as transacting all the Companys Affairs which fall under your management, with Integrity and Diligence. 15.

Should there be any Damage on or Deficiency the Cargo Consigned to you on the Prince Edward you are to adjust the same according to Charter- party, and you are to Demand and receive of the Commander the amount of such Damage or short Delivery. 18. As We leave it to Our President and Council of Bombay to make the necessary Remarks upon your Conduct and Proceedings in general, and to give such Orders from time to time as are expedient for the Interest of the Company in the various Circumstances of Affairs, We shall not interfere with them by entering into Particulars in this Letter, but should any thing material occu r we shall communicate it in our General Letter to the Presidency, from whence you will receive Notice thereof with the President and Council's Sentiments and Directions which from their Proximity will most properly be their Province. 19.

Since the date of the letter we have received the following Letters from you and Our Resident at Bussorah, by the way of Aleppo viz. Your letters of the 1st and 25th May, 8th, 14th and 15th of September, 20th and 28th November 1756, 25th February, 15th 30th April, 25th June, 14th and 20th July 1757.

Whatever packets or Letters you send by the way of Aleppo which are directed to us must be put under a Cover directed to the Consul thereto, sealed with your own seal to prevent as much as possible their being known and stopped or opened in the way from Bussorah which at this time they are more particularly exposed. 5. Our Committee of Secrecy this Season consists of JohnFayne, Laurence Sulivan, Peter Godfrey, Christopher Burrow and Jones Raymond, Bsqrs. whose Orders or those of any three of them (if they shall think proper to send any) are to meet with the most punctual Obedience, as are likewise ail such Orders as shall be sent you by the Committee of Secrecy for the time being, a new one being always appointed annually after the Directors for the ensuing Season are chosen. 6. We now enclose for your information a List of the Ships taken into the Company's Service this season together with an account of the Arrival and Departure of Our shipping in general since the date of that transmitted you by the Prince Edward. 7. The war between Great Britain and France continues, and likely to be carried on this year with vigour. You were informed by the Prince Edward of the formidable armament making at that time at port L'Orient for an Expedition to the East Indies, the public newspapers as well as private and certain Intelligence have confirmed the same, and mentioned the sailing of 17 ships from thence under the Command of Monsr. Danche on the 30th April last with 3,000 Land Eorces on board to be commanded by Monsr. Lally; We have lately been informed by certain Advices from the Brasils the part of this Armament consisting of 7 large ships with a great number of men on board put into E&gt;io De Eaneiro for the refreshment and Recovery of their numerous sick, having lost many men in their Passage thither, the Ships were left at Eaneiro the end of August when the advices came away proposed to go forward for India the month following. 8. All our settlements have been so well apprized of this Armament to which adding the probability of Commodore Steven's getting to India before it with 5 Men of War to join those already there that we are in great hopes this formidable effort will in a great measure be frustrated it is necessary you should have this Information, but the use you are to make of it for so far as the Company's Estate or Interest under your Care and Management may be affected, must be left to your prudence, and the Orders you may receive from your superiors. 9. The Woolen Goods provided and intended for the Persia Market this season consist of about Nine hundred Hales of Cloth, twenty five of Shalloons and two hundred and thirty Bales of long Ells together eight cases of Imbossed Cloth, We have laden as large a proportion there on this ship the admiral Watson as she can carry, together with some other Consignments, for the particulars of which We refer you to the accompanying Invoice and Bill of Lading in which are distinguished such as are for sale at Gombroon and those intended for Bus sorah. The remainder of the Bales will be sent to Bombay in order to be for warded to you; as Conveyances offer We dispatch the ship Admiral Watson this early and so long before the Bombay ships that you may not be under any disappointment, and We hope she will get to Gombroon goon enough to answer Our Intentions. 2578 F. D.122 10. The Medleys brought this Year for your Market and Bussorah have more of the fine sort amon? them than usual, which upon the whole 'We judge will be batter than any of the Dutch will send, We have before ordered you to send us Patterns of all the sorts of Woolen Goods they may import We now repeat, and if possible you must do it by this Ship. 11. You will receive by this ship 16 Bales of Shalloons with variety of Colours such as are usually sent for the Turkey Market which We think will please the Merchants you must be very particular in finding out those that are best liked as well as those that are disliked, and sending Patterns of each distinguishing them and giving us at the same time such Observations and Remarks as shall occur to you. VI.There are also a few Bales of Long Ells of the above Colours bv wav of Trial. ' 13.

In Your Letter of the 20th November 1756 you mention the great Damage m the Medley's which We observe has always been the case altho* ail methods have been tried here to prevent it. but some of those that *o this Year have been pressed by New Workmen wbom We learnt were more knowing tban those We employed before, their Bales will be distinguished in the Invoices you must acquaint us by the first Conveyance whether tbey come out better than the others, and by this ship send us about half a Yard of anv sort nf Medleys that is most spotted. 15.

We are sorry to observe such large sums advanced T • Carmania for the purchase of Wool in these precarious times we rZ 1 it to you to be no more in advance from time to time than shall 1 0 ^ me ^ d necessary, and indeed considering the directions in the preoedil A^raf h very small Matter will be sufficient. a 1S '' aph a 18.

Returned the Revenge from Gombroon, hy which we received a letter from the Assent and Council there, &amp; one from the Resident at Bussorah. Gombroon (Letter ^ from). The former was dated the 23rd ultimo, and acknowledged receipt of our comp^y-fsifips letters of the 15th March and 20th April, and our consigmueut for Revenge &amp; Drake, which turned out right. They advised the import of ships there since the 12tli May, &amp; mentioned their having been informed that the Hon'hle Company had taken up seventeen ships this season, with their destinationsj but particularized those intended hither. That they returned the Revenge and Drake with their remains of Carmenia wool amounting to Shas. 113,839 A 2 Goz &amp; as our Orders were so positive for having those vessels here by the middle of this month, they durst not presume to deviate therefrom, but hav ing consulted their Commandars in what time they might make their passage &amp; they being of opinion they could not exceed twelve days, ^ e y Agent 0rder8 to &amp; Council had permitted them to cruize for the Bristol till the 3rd Instant movements of the as from their advices, they having sent them before for that purpose, agreeable to our Orders would have been of no use, and therefore judged the only chance they had of meeting the French ship, was to permit them to cruize, as long as our Orders would permit of, which they bad communicated to Captn- Cleugh, and directed him to make the best of his way hither after the 3rd, that Mr. Shaw had acquainted them under the 19th May, the Bristol was to leave Bussorah in 15 days and by other accounts they judged she came over the bar the preceding new moon, &amp; was to lay at Carrack to complete at her cargoe of Wheat from Bushire &amp; Bunderick, &amp; if it could not be done from those places the French Resident was to make up the deficiency from Bussorah. That they would not fail to advise the Hon'ble Company how the naftonss a Goods are esteemed by the Persians, as soon as any inland merchants should arrive. That Hossan Caun's severities &amp; cruelties to the inhabitants of Spahaun had been confirmed, &amp; that he had ordered the Governor of Yezd to come to Kha^anTHo^aiiT him &amp; wrote an Order to the Governor of Carmenia to send him 1,0D0 horse- Khan - men, &amp; by a letter the Agent had received from JS T asseir Caun they were advised of his arrival before Shyrash, &amp; of a battle between his and Carem Caun's troops in which the latter were defeated &amp; obliged to retire into he City, which was besieged by the former, &amp; that these t wo competitors drew the attention of every body the fate of one of which they thought must ere long be determined. That the last accounts from Nasseir Caun mentioned his being at Toutioun, where Carem Caun had created him sufficient distur bances, tho' he wrote that he had defeated both Nasir Caun &amp; Hossan Suttoun, &amp; that a Body of 500 men were come to his assistance from Hossan Caun, &amp; that he soon expected a reinforcement of 2,000 more. That Meir Mastally bad surprized &amp; taken Shamill Fort in the night, which gave the Caun much uneasiness, as that garrison was a check upon their place &amp; minoe. That Mooley Ally Shaw had on the hearing of the news, caused guns to be fired by way of rejoicing &amp; ordered presents to be given the Choppars who brought him the account. That he had lately rejoiced at any misfortune 2578126 which happened to the Oaun, and shewn him slights, &amp; fro n what they could perceive, was the Caun to be defeated he would soon create them troubles, of which he was always speaking to his Crew of Arabs, &amp; bringing up the affair of the Persian ship carried thence by Mahomet Beg Shamloe. However, they hoped, should he act as he did last year, or otherwise annoy them, that we would take such steps as would convince him, we had it in our .power to resent an injury &amp; humble him, without which it would be difficult to carry on their affairs or to remain in any degree of security. That on the 18th Moolah Ally Shaw sent a party to attack Asseen Fort which they took, the Commandant having sav'd the few men he had by retreating thro narrow Pass, which Capture with his publick Rejoioing for that of Shamiel, surprized every body, and no one could account for it, but which would in the end occa sion troubles there, as the Caun would not put up with such treatment. That Moolah Ally Shaw had brought the Persian ships from Ormus with a Design, 'brings Persian as he says, to assist his son-in-law Shaik Rama who is at W ar with the His intention! 2 Immaum of Muscat, but they thought if such was his Design he would be more English vesseHo expeditious in getting them away as he knew the Immaum's fleet left Muscat the imam during month for Dubba. That they had been informed the Commander of a demned iesCOn ' Ketch, belonging to this Place had let out his vessel to the Imaum of Muscat to assist in his Present War, which they thought necessary to.represent, that none who trade under the Hon'ble Company's Protection may be suffered to interfere, or aid any of the Country Powers in their Disputes with each other, as it might embroil their affairs particularly in the present case, when one Party is so nearly related to the Govr. of the place, where the Hon'ble Company have a Factory. That their Surgeon having represented his ill state of Health &amp; desired permission to return hither, they had complied therewith, on Captn. Cleugh's acquainting them he would leave his surgeon there if theirs would act in the vessel, during her passage which he very readily agreed to. That Mr. Holmes having also laboured under a very bad state of Health, and the Surgeon representing his remaining there might be attended with bad consequences, they requested we would permit him to return hither. That they sent seven European Recruits on the Revenge and had taken out of her a Sarjeant &amp; Drummer in lieu of those who were dead, &amp; had also exchanged a Corporal and one European which they would pay their whole Pay from tho 1st ultimo, &amp; the Drummer only half pay from that time, those sent hither had received theirs to the 30fch ultimo, &amp; that as they might have occasion to land men from the Cruizers, they desired to know whether they should apply to the Commander of the Vessel or the Military Officer, as they seemed both to have pretensions thereto. That they had granted Bills on us for Rs. 6,000 in favour of John Parker. XCIV. Public Department Diary 31—1758. Bombay Castle, 23rd December 1785, Gombroon (Letter Imported the Dragon Captn. Richard Moore from Bussorah &amp; Gom- from.) broon, by whom received a Letter from the Agent &amp; Council at the latter place, dated the 10th Instant, &amp; acknowledging receipt of our Letter of the127 20th September. That they would immediately have returned the Viper Ketch, ^ahomed^Veliy had not they heea prevented by the Troubles occasioned in their neisrhbourhood KarimThan 7 by Carem Gauns having sent Mahomed Velly Caun, with 4,000 men, who pluSera^h^ 001 seized and plundered everything they met with, particularly a caffila from tZToFtbe'r^. Carmenia worth about 40,000 Rupees, and pretended they were sent to reduce those parts under Carem Caun's obedience, but as from what they, the Agent &amp; Council, could perceive, their principal view was to plunder, and as they had been for some time, within a few Days' march of that Place, they had deemed it necessary to detain the Viper, till they were certain of Mahomed Velly Caun's Designs, as the Commander of the Guard Vessel informed them he could only land an officer, &amp; six men to their assistance, which we hoped they would not therefore disapprove. That Moolah Ally Shaw was retired to Ormus and that it was reported, Sherriary had laid a Tax on the Inhabitants of Menoe, of 30,000 Rupees, for a present to Mahomet Velly Caun, &amp; his princi pal officers. That in October Nasseir Caun sent a party to guard some Passes near Hodjeland, where they had an ensragement with Mahomet Velly Caun who killed their Commanding Officer, since when Nasseir Caun had not moved, &amp; they thought he would have enough to do, to defend his own Forts, &amp; had for some time been fortifying Lhor. That Carem Caun had taken Yezd and laid a Tax of 26,000 Tomaunds on the inhabitants, besides obliging them to supply his army, with 22,000 maunds of provisions daily, &amp; that Tyrannv &amp; oppression was got to such a Height, as to threaten the ruin of all Trade in that Kingdom. That they had a Report of one of Carem Caun's Officers having been defeated by Hossaun Caun, &amp; that he was gone to his assistance. They advised the arrival there, of our Hon. Master's Ship the Admiral Watson, with goods for that &amp; Bussorah Market, &amp; as the Company had permitted them to send her up the Gulph, with the Goods for Bussorah, &amp; as they had a Quantity of Woollens laying there for that place, they had laden on her 337 Bales of Cloth, Nine of Shalloons, two of Camblets, 185 of Perpets, one case of Imbossed Cloth, Iron 197 cwt. 2 qrs. 3 lbs. ten Tons of Lead and one Bale of Musters, and would have sailed as soon as her Crew (32 of whom were unable to do duty on her arrival) recovered from the scurvy had thev not received a Letter from Mr. Shaw advising that he had agreed with Captn. Parkinson, to proceed to Gombroon and return to Bussorah with such Woollens as they might put on board him at five Rupees per Bale, esteeming it better to pay one Rupee extraordinary, than let so large a Quantity of Woollens lay a whole season unsold, &amp; as a further inducement to said Parkinson, he had agreed to allow him the Hon'ble Company's silver freight to Bussorah, &amp; six Rupees the Bombay Candy for metals. That as there were several particulars in Mr. Shaw's Contract, which they were unacquainted with, they had come to no resolution, regarding the Admiral Watson, and, if possible proposed complying with such Indents, as the Resident might make them. That they heard the Dutch intended to withdraw their Factory from Gombroon, &amp; that a ship was daily expected from Carrack for that purpose. That our Packet for the Hon'ble Company had been sent per Boat Express to Bussorah, but its safe arrival at Aleppo seemed doubtful, from the frequent Robberies on the Desart. They mentioned Mr. Holmes' Death, and advised their sending one sett of their Diary brought up to the Day, &amp; one sett of their books, ending the 31st July last &amp; hoped we would excuse their not sending the usual paper by this ship, as the Hurry of her Dispatch, prevented128 them. That the Admiral Watson left England the 18th May, with the Drake and True Briton, &amp; that the Eastoourt &amp; Stretham, also designed hither, were at Grave's end, when she sailed. xcv.

XCVI. Public Department Diary No. 32. Bombay Castle, 23rd January 1758. (L^terXom) Imported our Hon'ble Masters' own Ship, named the Admiral Watson, Mahomed v^iiy commanded by Captn. William Cooke from Great Britain but last from ah Shaw's move- Gombroon by whom received a Letter from the Agent and Council under the 7th instant, acquainting Us, that they had laden on her sundries amounting to Shahees 643,175, and that from Mr. Shaw's advising he had agreed with Captain Parkinson, to carry the Woolens, etc, to Bussorah, they had let them remain on board the Admiral Watson for the more easy transhipping them on Parkinson's arrival, but he to their great surprize not having appeared and as the detaining this ship, might endanger her Passage to England, they had resolved to tranship the Woolens on board the Cruizers, to land the Staples and dispatch her hither, which they hoped We would approve, &amp; not pass any Censure on them, for her long Detention, which proceeded entirely from ^he Dependance they had on Mr. Shaw's Letter, that they proposed letting the Goods remain on board the Cruizers, till Parkinson's arrival, as in Case of Velly Caun's Arrival there, they might find it difficult to remove them from the shore, the Inhabitants being mostly retired to the Islands, that Carem Caun's soldiers, commanded by Mahomet Velly Caun, were within six days* Journey of them and as it was judged they would pass that way. Moolah Ally Shaw had sent Boats, to transport the Inhabitants &amp; their Effects to the Islands, &amp; it was reported Velly Caun had made a Demand of 2,000 Tomands &amp; 100 Soldiers on Sherriary of Mino and that demands had also been made on Meer Mastally, and Meer Ally Doud, and that while he staid in that Neighbourhood, no Trade could be Carried on, nor were people in any degree of Safety. That Sharook Caun, Governour of Carmenia, had obtained a0 129 Rogom from Carem Cauiij appointing him Sardar of the same Province &lt;fe as soon as he received it, he marched with 5,000 men to Girofte and Messengers were constantly passing between him and Mahomet Velly Caun in order to adjust matters, which they had heard was effected tho' afterwards contradicted, as each endeavoured to deceive ; &amp; the Governour of Bam had joined the former with 1,000 men, as had also a small Body of Nassier Caun's Soldiers, and the two armies were within five Miles of each other, that Nassier Caun continued putting Lhor in the Best Posture of Defence, and had wrote the Agent of his having sent assistance against 'Velly Caun, and in case they did not succeed, he advised the Agent to be on his Guard, as Carem Caun's Soldiers committed great Havoc, wherever they went, that their Gunner, having requested to proceed hither on account of his Health, they had acquiesced therein and taken a Man out of the Viper to act in that capacity, till another could be sent from hence. That in a Bale of Medleys received per Bevenge and Drake, they had found Town Pieces mildened, and worm- eaten, tho* the outside Package appeared good and whole and therefore sent the Worm-eaten Pieces for own Inspection. That agreeable to their last a Ship had arrived from Caracl and carried away most of the Dutch Go'&gt;ds and Surplus Cash, and another was expected to take the Gentlemen, Guns, etc., and the Linguist to receive Charge of their Factory with some Brimstone, they proposed leaving there. That as in case of Troubles they might find it difficult to supply the People with Meat, they had landed a Cask of Europe Beef from this Ship, which, if they did not use, they would send by the Pirst Conveyance. That they had just heard Carem Caun's Troops, were advancing towards Minoe, That Sundry Papers and a Set of their Diary and General Books accompanied this, That they had received 9 Pigs of Lead from the Admiral Watson, which Captain Cooke promised to deliver to us. XCVII. Public Department Diary No. 32. Bombay Castle, Sunday, 11th March 1759. Camp in the Elizabeth Ketch with a Letter from the Agent and Council Gombroon (Letior at Gombroon dated the 6th Ultimo owning Beceipt of Ours of the 18th frorD), December and advising that in consequence of having learnt that Captain Parkinson was still at Bussorah the 16th January, they imagined, their Letter of the 21st November, advising the Besident of their Intentions, to send the Admiral Watson thither, had occasioned his getting off his Contract, &amp; there fore came to a Resolution of sending the Swallow with 535 Bales of Woolens, and all the Lead, &amp; if they had therein committed an Error, they hoped we would overlook it, as they were induced thereto, to prevent so large a Quantity of Goods lying there unsold, and the sending them to Bussorah, on Merchant Vessels, was very precarious. That Mr. Thomas proceeded hither agreeable to our Permission, and bad received his Salary to the 31st July, and as they had only one Assistant, they desired Two Junior Servants, might be sent them. That Mahomed Velly Caun arrived at Minoe the 12th Janry. and by his Khan's^wemeuts oppressions during 15 days he remained there, they learnt, that Place was entirely ruined. He left it on the 28th &amp; arrived the 30th within Ten 2578 F D130 Leagues of them, and they imagined lie would either take that, or the Asseen Koad, as Nasseir Caun had well guarded the short Koads thro' the Moun tains which lead to Lhor, the siege of which Place according to the Appear ance of Affairs was resolved on, That as their Hoads had been stopped for some time, they could speak with iittle Certainty of Affairs Inland, but if Careem Oaun and his Generals continued to act as Mahomet Velly Caun, had done, they bid fair for the Ruin of that Kingdom. That a Dutch Ship arrived there the 26th January, to carry away all their stores and that the Gentlemen had embarked the 3rd Ultimo. XCVIIL Public Department Diary No. 32. Bombay Castle, 17th April 1759» Gombrdon (Letter Eeturned the Viper Ketch with a Letter from the Agent &amp; Council at Gombroon under the 2nd instant, advising their having despatched our Packet to the Hon'ble Company under the 2nd February on the 17th ultimo. That as the Hon'ble Company had given them no Directions about the Admiral Watson's Packet, they were afraid to risque it on a Country Vessel, but desired our Instructions for their future conduct in like Cases. That they had given the Resident at Bussorah the necessary Directions regard ing the Medleys mentioned to be pressed by new Workmen, and that as the sale of the Cloth for their Market, was precarious, they had not unpacked it, but when the^ did, should advise us of all Particulars. That the Dutch had imported no Woolens since the year 175and as no inland Merchants had been there for some time, they could not comply with the Hon'ble Company's Directions regarding the new Manufacture of Woolen Stuff, nor send Patterns of the Shalloons and long Ells. That we had been duely advised of the Motions of Mahomed Velly Caun whom Carem Caun had appointed cardar of the Hot countries, and who having once approached so near them as Agency linguist Nabam, they had judged proper to send their Linguist to pay him their Com- Mahomed'velly pli^ents, whom he received very gentesly &amp; presented with a Coat of Khan, who is pre- Honour. That he publickly declared his Design against Lhor, and his inten- Gombroo^and tion, if successfull, of subjecting all their neighbourhood to Carem Caun's obedience, and till affairs were settle 1 between him and Nassier Caun, they aoprehended that part of the Country would be in a most confused state. That Mahomed Velly Caun being muoh dissatisfied with Mullah Ally Shaw, had sent a Messenger to acquaint him, he was greatly deceived if he thought to escape, as tho' his affairs called him to Lhorr, he would rather return or send a proper Person to be Governour of Gombroon, at the same time taking care to have a sufficient force to attack Gombroon, in which the case the Agent and Council were apprehensive, he would insist on the assistance of our Vessels, and if refused, might act as Taugy Caun had done in the year 1738. That Moolah Ally Shaw while he could bold Ormuse and collect the Revenues of Gombroon, &amp;o., seemed regardless of the continent in time of troubles, but generally returned as soon as they were blown over, behaving with the greatest arrogance; that he had applied to the Agent for the loan of 4,000 Rupees, and seemed' greatly displeased at being refused, which made them apprehen sive of his creating them troubles. That all their inhabitants except the131 ^Factory's servants being absent at the Islands, the Arabs had broke open their Attack 0 f Araba houses and carried away doors, timber, &amp;c., of which complaint was made by Se r tant8' g hou»es the Agent to the Deputy Goveruour, who desired its being his people, but desired the agressors might be seized, and he would punish them ; that our People accordingly catched some Arab soldiers and were leading them to the Deputy Governor when they drew their swords, called for assistance from the Fort, and cut several Men, among whom was one of their Shotters, and tho* application was made several times, no redress could be obtained, as they understood, they were part of a Tribe nobody but Shaik Eama dared to punish and who joined to the Charack Arabs had fitted out armed trankeys, under pretence of cruizing on Shaik Hatten and Meer Manna, the latter of whom as well as those Arabs, seized every Vessel they could lay their hands on, so that it was probable, the Gulph would soon be full of Petty Robers. That Mahomet Keza Caun formerly Governour of a District in the Carmenla Road had come into Town under pretence of paying the Agent a visit, but whose real Design was to borrow 500 Tomaunds, and as he was a man who had some Influence on Mahomet Velly Caun, they had treated him with the utmost Civility, but had given him a Refusal in as easy Terms as possible. That Carem Caun was at Tarroun endeavouring to reestablish Spahaun in order to encourage people to settle there had exempted them from taxes for three years. That Shyrash was governed by his brother Shadduck Caun, and that Nasseir Caun was still at Lhor, whose chief dependence was on it's strength, and the fidelity of his men. They enclosed a Copy of a letter from the Commander of the Guard Vessel, which they hoped would convince us of the necessity for their detaining the Viper, which as we seemed desirous of having her, and Mahomet Velly Caun was retired, they ventured to return, but submitted to us, whether their Garrison of Blacks was sufficient during the then situation of affairs in that Kingdom. That as the Speedwell had lost several of her People, they had supplied her with a corporal and ten topasses, and as the Commander had represented she was very leaky, which had prevented their sending her to Bussorah they desired to know if they should lade on her any Carmenia Wool on her being relieved. That they returned the old Detachment of Military except the above Corporal &amp; Topasses and the Seepoys which were sent on board the Swallow at the Commander's request. That they had delivered to Captain Juce, the Cask of Beef received from the Admiral Watson &amp; that Captain Crichton of the Speedwell died the 12th ultimo. XCIX. Public Department Diary No. 32. Bombay Castle, Saturday, 7th July 1759. Arrived the Swallow with a Letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon Gombroon and one from the Resident at Bussorah. ' L i The former was under the 9th ultimo, and advised that they had laden on the Swallow, sundries to the amount of Shahees 933,202-1 Goz. They enclosed copy of a Paragraph from Mr. Shaw, by which they said, we would perceive the reason of Captain Parkinson's not coming for the Wcolens, as was expected, also Mr. Shaw's request for a fresh Supply of Goods which they132 had partly complied with and should compleat as soon as they received those intended by our Ships, for the Bassorah Market, That as silver Rupees began to be scarce at Bassorah, and Mr. Shaw had requested Directions regarding his future Remittances, they desired to know what species of Gold would answer best that they might ootnply with his request. That inland advices Karh^Khan'^ mentioned, one of CUrem Oaun's Generals, having taken Istraband and forces. Mahomed Velly Oaun was near Lhor, where he was positively ordered by Carem Oaun, to remain till reinforced, and that the latter intended to be about that time crowned at Spahaun. That they consigned us the Gold sent thither by Mr. Shaw, and tho' he had only acquainted them, with the Prices of two Sorts, yet as there were several different kinds, they imagined it to be an omission of his, and had wrote him accordingly. c.

As to the Topasses and seepoys, few of them would stand to the Guns, about 11 o'clock being high water, their ship of twenty two Guns, hauled within about one quarter of a mile of the Pactory, and began to play on us, at the same time, they ashore played on us, with their mortars and guns from the Westward. At about half an hour past three in the afternoon, a summons was sent from the Prench Camp, upon which the Agent called a Council of 'War consisting of himself William Nash, Lieutenants Bembou and Evans and Ensign Johnson, wherein the strength of the House was considered, with the People we had to defend it, and our being sure of having no succour from Moolah Ally Shaw. The Military Gentlemen were of unanimous Opinion that the house was not tenable upon which it was unanimously agreed to make the best terms we could, and that night the same was agreed on, as p. copv of the capitulation herewith enclosed, but sorry we are to remark the same has not been observed, in the manner we might have expected from Europeans, they have gone so far as to take away a few liquors we bad for our use and many other things unnecessary at present to trouble your Hnour, etc., with, to be brief they comply with the articles just as they like. The Prench are at present embarking the old copper, and unloading the Mamoodie, whose cargoe consisting of Dates they have given to Moolah Ally Shaw, who supplies them with every thing in his power, at present by what we can perceive their stay here will be no longer, than needs must, and will go to some Port in India.133 The Prench had on shore, when tbey took possession of the Factory according to the best accounts we cou'd take, about four hundred and fifty Europeans and one hundred and fifty Co (Trees, they had brought Bamboes with them and made scalling ladders, and were determined to have scaled the House, on tbe 13th at night. On the 12th we had Intelligence of the French, having been at Muscat, and were bound further up the Gulph, upon which Lieutenant Bembou was ordered to carry the Speedwell to loft, but before he cou'd get under weigh, the French appeared, and prevented his complying with orders, which being perceived, he was told to run the ship ashore, but being pursued very close by the Twenty two gun ship, and the Tide flowing and having two sails set, she floated, and the French sent People, and took possession of her so they have now Five ships. On the 12th while the French ships were standing into the Road, Moolah Ally Shaw came to the Factory and gave the Agent all imaginable assur ances, of his affording us assistance and that if the French attempted to land he would do what in power to prevent it but on his being sent to in the morning and acquainted that they were approaching the shore in order to land instead of performing his Promise he remained quiet in his Fort, and tho' about ten o'clock the Agent requested he would send a few men to our assistance, yet not a man cou'd be got, the reason he assigned for not doing if, was that one of his ships which was at anchor in the anchor was in their Power, and that if he afforded us assistance of men, they would certainly carry her away; tho' to be brief, he was really afraid of the French, and not long after their landing, sent them such refreshments of greens and fruits, as the season afforded, telling them he would supply them, with whatever in his Power and the Place afforded. Out of the few number of Europeans we bad, we beg leave to acquaint vonr Honour etc., tbat Ensign Johnston, and Serjeant Ranseommon. were so much indisposed as to be able to do no duty, the day we were attacked. The French have sent tbe Europeans and Topasses on board their ships and have given liberty to the seepoys to go where they like. Accofdiu.' to the best Intelligence, we can get the Erench have positive orders to demolish the Eaotory saying the English demolished their Settlement at Ohardana^ore, itho' for the present to keep thing smoothed with Moola Ah Shaw they tell him a they will make him present thereof, at the same time they tell our gentlemen, they have no such design, and that its only done to luse him for the present, being in want of his assistance Messrs Bembou Evans, Johnston and Mainwaring, now repair, at their own particular icquest 10 BO The a Two French Ships were fitted out from the Islands, and as they say. on purpose for this place, and had been just five weeks from thence, when French are gone, we shall endevour to get down this year's investment of wool, and endevour to P -ure money o the lingmstfo toTfyTor the same, and shouldany Guard Ship have-left Bombay with woolen foods for this place e'er this reaches your Honour etc., we shall take those ashore for market, and afterwards send the vessel to Jiussorah; at present Woolens are in demand in the inland Farts, according to the information we have received. 2/58 F.D134 At present we reside at the Dutch Factory.

Came in a Dingey, with a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon dated the 8tb ultimo, acquainting us, that the Erench left that place the 2nd136 The French leave and they believed were really gone to the Islands. That on the 30th October Gombroon setting , ^ . i . e, l ,* ji j . xt , fire to the English at night they went on board their ships alter setting lire to tne Jcactory thfpilcehyMufia wherein they had dug mines and placed combustibles, by which means great people aW and bl8 part of it was destroyed, but had it not been for the villainy of Moolah Ally Shaw, they believe much might have been saved, for when the French quitted it, not a Door of the Compound was touched, but no sooner were they gone, than he set fire thereto, in order to get the Iron Work, and they also left behind, upwards of 30,000 maunds of Copper and other Goods, but notwith standing their repeated applications to him, for People to Guard them, he gave them up to a general pillage and was so barefaced, as to confess, in a visit he made the Agent, that he believed there was none but what had a share in the booty. However, they hoped he would be convinced, the English could resent an injury, which might easily be done. That they concluded he had gained on the whole, about 60,000 Eupees, exclusive of the guns, etc., left him by the French &amp; his whole tribe of Arabs had profited in proportion and that he had entered into an alliance offensive and defensive with the French, the obligation being signed by Monsieur D'Estaing and wrote in French and his was wrote in Persians. That they had mentioned the little re gard shewn to the articles of Capitulation, and believe of Monsieur D'Estaing had not been there. Des Essars would have deprived them of every common necessary as he publickly avowed his aversion to all Englishmen, and acted in such a manner, as to dishonour the name of a Commander-in-Chief. That they had burnt the Speed well, and as from what the Agent and Council could learn, they were bound to the Islands and Serjeant Kanscommon being unable to undertake so long a voyage they had wrote to Monsieur D'Estain^ for his being sent on shore, which he had granted and only desired one of his countrymen, might be released in his stead, which they hoped we would comply with.

Letter from Imported our Hon'ble Masters' ship Godolphin, Captain William The Ormnz people Hutchinson, with a letter from the Agent &amp; Council at Gombroon, dated the Muiia lirshaw 31st ultimo, advising that they had landed the Woolens sent on this ship, and SoleTthe^nsur. that inhabitants of Ormuz had revolted and seized on Moolah Ally Shaw and gents seize Gomb- ft. tw at sam e time that some other of his subiects possessed themselves roon and refused to 5 give it up to duffer 0 f \^[ s ;p or t a t Gombroon and obliged his Deputies and tribe of Conjees to fly to Khan' b 'b rot her). the Islands, that Nassier Caun's* brother being at that time in the neighbour- fa'n'attem^to 8 ' hood with 200 men, had demanded the fort of that place in behalf of his ZTproMelTto brother as Lord of Farse which was soon agreed to.

People had given up to the Charrack Arabs the Ship Furzaraboony which was brought into that road and delivered to Nassier Caun's Brother. That the Benimine Arabs being apprehensive their Families on the Island of Kishme would be plundered by their enemies, had marched thither joined by 100 of Nassier Caun's Men, and proposed undertaking the siege of Loft, as soon as * Jaffer Khan.137 they could be reinforced, and were then within six miles of it. That the Arabian population of it had wrote several threatening letters to the Caun to prevent his interfering and the Roumania not being; in his hands gave him much, uneasiness, which had induced him to desire the Godolphin might be sent to take her, but as she lay in Loft River they did not chuseto spare the Godolphin as she drew so much water, tho' when the Drake or Swallow arrived they would be obliged to assist him as while affairs remained in that unsettled state little Business could be done. That the Inhabitants of Ormuse kept Mullah Ally Shaw close in the Fort, and seemed not inclinable, even to deliver him to the Caun who had demanded him and proposed their dividing his Plunder with him, but they alleged he had nothing remaining and tho' they outwardly professed an obedience to the Caun, they seemed to be careful not to be enslaved by him. That had Mullah Ally Shaw continued in the Government, suitable remonstrances would have been made him though they apprehended it would have been to no purpose. That his strength consisted only of about 200 Men and that he had no alliance with any on the Continental, till last November when he married his Daughter to Moolah 2%^ s Masson who could raise about 400 men, that his Chief connection formerly was l r abs. with the Shaik of Julfar, who always made him pay weU for his assistance, and that his Sea Force consisted of two ships, one large Galliwat and one armed Trankey, and when they went to Sea the soldiers on board their were part of the aforementioned. That the Dutch Factory was left in charge of the Linguist, who having no authority either to let or sell it, the Agent had wrote the Chief of Carrack regarding it whose answer when received should be com municated to us. That they had hired two houses to lodge the Godolphin's Con signment and to live in, and strengthened one, as well as they were able. That as they had received only one short letter from Bu^sorah, since May last, they could give us no account of Mr. Shaw's Journey to Bagdat or of the consequence of it. They enclosed Messrs. Nash &amp; Lysters Covenants, and represented their inability to return any part of the Military sent them, till affairs were in a more settled state, when they would not fail to do it. That they had notified the Godolphin's arrival with Woolens and tho' the heats were set in, they did not doubt but some merchants would come dowu. They requested the supply of perpets and that two writers might be sent to their assistance. That they had receired no wool from Carmenia, and when any came down they would be obliged to send it as received, as they had no screws to pack it as formerly. They wished the Drake or Swallow had arrived before the Godolphin s depar- ture, but as our orders were positive to have her returned, they had done it as soon as possible for having no place to lodge her consignmeut m on her arrival they did not venture to land it as the Juffar Arabs had often threatened ^ ^ a descent there.

Beceived by her a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon, dated the 16th ultimo acknowledging receipt of ours of the 25th April and 27th May, and advising the Swallows having left that place for Bussorah the 30th April with positive orders to the Besident for being immediately returned, but she was not then come back, nor could they account for her detention as they only know she remained at Bussorah the 16th August on the 23rd of which month they were advised by the Broker at Muscat of five Prench ships being in the Gulph which they directly communicated again on learning from the Broker that the Eeport was false. That only one Dutch ship was arrived in the Gulph, the Commander of which had wrote the Agent that he left Batavia the 13th June when the French under Command of the Count D'Estain had taken possession of all our settlements on the West Coast from whence several English gentleman and ladies were come to Batavia and that it was not known whether the Trench ships would go there or return to the Islands. That they were concerned to observe their sales were not near so large as they expected a139 Karim Fhan's owing to the Province of Corazonn being involved in Troubles, but as they heard matters were going to be adjusted there they hoped Trade would again flourish. That they had received from Carmania, the Wool investment being 3,000 Mauuds, 2,820 of which was the red sort, 13fr white and 45 Grey, the las* of which they proposed returning to sell for what it would fetch. That the interior parts of Persia were till in the utmost confusion and that Carem Gaun p 0g j t i 011- who bad been endeavouring to bring the empire under his subjection met with so many powerful competitors that he really believed he would not succeed and that some of his Generals had been lately defeated. That there had been very little Trade carried on at Carmenia for some months past and that the lulfar Arabs bad been endeavouring at the recovery of that place and Ormuse tho without success. That the ship Poozeraboony which belonged to Nassir Oaun, the Binimine Arabs left at Muscat, and it was believed that the Imaum would never return her, but send her here to be repaired, on his own account. That ^ on the 24th June 1000 lulfar Arabs with Shaik Eachid and Moolah Ally Shaw Ml 3 la at their head landed within about 500 yeards of the town of Gombroon which seiz ' Gombroon, they entered and took possession of the same evening and tho' they continued firing at the Port where the Oaun's soldiers who also fired in return till the 28th. No execution was done on either side and the Xulfar Arabs reimbarked again, and returned to Kishme duing their stay at Gombroon, the Inhabitants were plundered, both by him and the Cauns people. That Nassir Caun had made an attempt upon Linga, but found it better prepared than he expected and they learnt of his affairs did not take a bad turn, he intended visiting Gombroon and that he in August attempted to plunder lulfar, but finding it too well prepared he proceeded to Kishme and laid waste and plundered every where he came to. That Jaffer Caun's Oppressions prevented the merchants MerJW. comins there, and from his behaviour to them, and the Impediments they met with on his account they doubted not he would plunder them if he found an opportunity, but as coming to a rupture with him they thought not prudent while his brother Nassir Caun was so near with a considerable force they had nrivatelv sent to him, to know if his Brother's behaviour was with the approba- tion when they learnt Jaffer Caun had wrote him many Palsities which had occasioned his giving him leave to create them disturbances, but on their messenger's Representations he was greatly appeased, and promised soon to m o if mi hk o-oino' to Gombroon. That he had requested DrakeKetlhto'convey the Binimine Irabs * who were desirons of settling the ^ A £ brought there and from what information they could get he was much displeased ft their refusal. Besides their having no Porce to with 6 tand hi S army which consisted of 2,500 men should he be induced to plunder te, him . had occasioned their at last consenting and she accordingly sailed the 11th September on that service. Property then there and their Inability to res.st beptemoer to geize it wh i 0 i 1 he might easily do, as they had nTplace of Defence to lodge it in. had also induced them to comply with - j inan of 1 000 Tomaunds tho they had used every method'fn the^TJer to evade it. as they believed Jaffer Caun capable of fW thev desired. Our directions for their future proceedings and wished ZrcCLdTen there, that they might be at a certainty, about what footing they were to be on. That on receipt of our Commands they had taken t! consideration the most likely means to get possession of the Island Ormuse and judged none so likely as doing it thro' the inhabitants and as a constant —o ondence had been kept up with the Commanding Officer, the ~ ' * To Gombroon from Ormuz P140 \ Agent accompanied by Captain Baillie went over and had a conference with him, when he expressed himself well pleased with our getting on the island but would be by no means consent to delivering up the Fort and tho' as he was an avaricious man a sura of money was offered him, he would by no means hear of it. Captain Baillie was therefore consulted as to the expediency of AstotakingOrmuz, ^ tlie force tlien lia ^' C0 Py wllos e answer they enclosed, NaT?Kh^wf' ai1 ^ re P reseilte( l tlie improbability of getting possession of it, thro' Nassir let the Engiisk Caun, as he was too sensible how much Gombroon benefited by their being th^pi^e^The 1 for there and would therefore never be instrumental in their removing, and tho 5 place was barren, the Ormuse people acknowledged him for their Chief, they had not yet paid a due obedience to his orders and it was rumoured they and the Binimine Arabs had agreed to reside on the Island together, and that the latter desiring to remove to Gombroon was only a cloak to their design, and to get away from Carack. That the Island Ormuse was quite barrren. Moolah Ally Shaw having had his chief supplies from the main. That there was one well on the Island and that two league distance from the Fort about which, however there were several Eeservoirs for water but were out of repair, and in it they were told were two Tanks capable of holding a twelve months' water, for two hundred men. That the parapets of the Eort were much out of repair and the buildings in a ruinous condition and the Agent was told it would cost 80,000 Eupees to put it in proper order. That there was on the Island about 300 people, 100 of which were soldiers for its defence. That their sepoys had received no testimony alledged they received at Surat but as Chief and Council there sent them no account and they had received no directions from us, they had deferred paying till they had our orders. They advised Mr. Mash's being dead and desired more Assistants enclosed a list of stores wanting in our consignment per Godophin and men tioned their having received the perpets per lively and their having had very seekly season. That by a letter from Nassir Caun they imagined he was then within 10 Leagues of them, and they learnt he had ordered Jaffer Caun to attend him, as also the Governor of Hodjiaband, with what force he could raise, as from thence he intended sending troops of Kishme and would soon be at Gombroon. They enclosed copy of a letter just received from Mr. Shaw at Bussorah, and desired we would send no more woollen goods till we heard from them as their remains were large. cv. Public Department Diary No. 35. Bombay Castle, 17th October 1760. Imported the Drake Ketch with a letter from the Agent and Council at Gombroon, dated the 3rd instant, advising that the Resident at Bussorah had acquainted them under the 15th April, that rupees not being procurable he had sent Veneatins Nadarees which they now forwarded thither and desired to know how they turned out, that they might advise the Resident accordingly. That the Resident had advised them, several of the Goods sent per Admiral Pocock, were damaged and that he had protested against the Commander for the same and returned his Bill of Lading for its being adjusted by 'hem which they had not been able to do, as the Commander only said141 there a few Hours, but as he alledged the goods were forty two days in ware- ^ t ^enr C0 *. house, before he was called upon to see them examined and that he did not received the protest till he was on board bis ship to sail, they had noticed these Khan. The latte* . , t t a ^ T\ disapproves ot nis particulars to the Resident and enclosed us the Bill of Lading, Account Uamage brother Jaffer and Protest. That the Resident having desired to know whether he should ^LnTJii'inF.nd continue levying the shipping present etc. Duties of the English vessels any longer than was necessary to reimburse the expenses the Honourable Company had been at, on that account, they had directed him to discontinue the same, and desired to know, if we approved it. That since their last Nasseir Oaun had sent for Jaffer Caun and had shewn him many slights disapproving his conduct there and proposed to send one of his officers to be a check upon him. That Nasseir Caun had promised soon to put the Loan made him in a course of payment and assured them nothing but necessity could have made him so pressing for the same. That he had lain encamped for some time at Gamier and sent over Troops to Kishme, which had effectually plundered it, and that he was endeavouring to settle matters with Carem Caun, which if he agreed to certain conditions they believed would be brought about, in which case he would reign sovereign of the Hot Countries, and which made him very anxious to get to Lhor, but in order to keep affairs quiet there, during his absence he was endeavouring to clap up a peace with Mooly Ally Shaw, but whether ho would succeed was not known. That Sheriary had been very desirous to get Moola Ally Shaw's Pamily released, but without success, and that Nassir Caun had sent some Benimine and Charrack Arabs to Ormuse, for fear of Sherriarys getting possession of it, by which they imagined some formal agreement had passed between these Arabs and the Ormuse people. That they had heard nothing of Carem Caun but as some letters mentioned the arrival of two Coffilas from Cazaroonm they hoped Trade would again begin to flourish. That Lieutenant Nack had applied for leave to return here on account his health and as they were convinced of the necessity for it, they had granted the same. They enclosed Invoice of Sundries laden on the Drake to the amount of Shahees 6,1909 and advised their having sent by her, their books and diaries, and that they would not have dispatched her before the Swallow's Return from Bussorah had not Captain Baillie urged the necessity of it, on account the badness of her cables, and as most of their Europeans were dead, they had detained five of her compliment. That the Euzeraboony, and a vessel belonging to the Imaum of Muscat were arrived off Ormuse with a view of assisting Nasseir Caun and the Benimine and other. Arabs against the lulfar Arabs and that he was set out for Lhor without coming to any terms with either them or Moolah Ally Shaw leaving things in the greatest con fusion, and in short, that there seemed to be nothing, but deceit amongst the governing powers in those points, CVL Public Diary No. 36 of 1761.

They must be acquired that our intention is to wait for our Hon'ble Masters' sentiments and directions before we can think of laying out much money any where for security, especially at Gomhroon, and our present views regarding the French will not permit us at present to recur to hostile measures, should such from subsequent advices be thought necessary on all which and as to the most proper places for a settlement, wo must demand the Agents clear and explicit sentiments tho if any other place is fixed on we still think, a House with a servant at Gombroon will be necessary in order to preserve a communication with Carmama, and also to keep open an intercourse with the Caravans, that may come from the interior Provinces of Persia.143 Resolved that we enjoin the Agent and Council to keep no more money than is necessary, for the current expenees, and Wool they may have a prospect of procuring, as we shall, before the close of the season, send another Conveyance to bring away the remains of treasure, copper, wool and, other goods they have on hand.

Draper and Boddam. That they learn by advise from Carmenia of Carem Oauns Governor oppressing the inhabitants in which they were sorry to acquaint us our Linguist was not exempted. Therefore the Agent would write to Garem Caun about it and order the Linguist to forward the wool investment with expedi tion, and if he should find impracticable to live there in any Degree of security he might by his sending away the Wool be ready to embrace the first opportunity of returning there. That Carem Caun had ordered twenty thousand Tomaunds to be taken from Carmenia to pay the Military, five thousand for himself, and five thousand for his Choppars: That when the distribution came to be made, it was found to be seven times more than the usual Tax; That the Kingdom seemed to go very fast unto Ruin the Great Men paying no regard to the Subject, but only the gratifying their soldiers and Dependents and they much feared the Euin of Trade would be the conse quence : That affairs there continued in the same Situation as we last learned from them. cix.

The Dutch at Kamk. received a Letter from the Chief and Council at Gombroon dated the 9th ultimo wherein they acknowledged our's by the Swallow which Vessel they had dispatched to Bussorah. That they judging by the Orders for getting Posses sion of Ormus being of a prior date which he now desired might be^eferred till his return from Bussorah as he intended viewing all the Islands some of which he imagined would be better than the Continent where daily Importations and the Hon'ble Company's Property being unsafe rendered it too heavy an expense for the Profits arising on the Woollen Trade and if they could not carry on affairs without a Military Force a loss in the end must ensue, and even on an Island they thought it would not be secure without some force especially on their first settling. That the Dutch by the best accounts they could get, had always at Carrack about 160 Europeans with some Coffrees : They remarked if Jaffer Caun the least suspected their Design of removing he would use the utmost of his power to prevent it, therefore should we on the Hon'ble Company fix on any particular spot they requested such a Eorce as would prevent the Government there seizing either the Hon'ble Company's or their property : That the Loan made to Nassir Caun they begged leave to assure us was not thro' choise but necessity to prevent the whole of the Company's Property being put to a Bisque as they were convinced if it was refused he would have given his Brother leave to have attached them, thus affairs were situated there thro' the avafitious disposition of the present Government whom they endeavoured to keep on terms with, but which they found impossible unless they at times complied with his demands, or could they tell how to avoid it and notwithstanding their utmost care he was 3,718 Rupees and 18 Shahees in their Debt: That it having always being a Custom for all145 Commands and Supercargoes belonging to English Vessels to reside and life in the Factory and eat at the Public Table, the Enorease and Decrease of that Tcltlo 6XD6DS€8» Article did not depend on the number of Company's servants but as we thought the table expenses run high, they should only continue it to the end of the month and allow every junior servant 40 Rupees per Month, but the Agent submitted his allowance to be settled by us. That we should observe the great Danger in the Woollens was mostly in the Medleys, and which they said had been so for many years and imagined that not only what was sent to them was so spotted and mildened, but likewise what we received from Europe that our Hon'ble Masters had been several times addressed on this subject, to which they referred and mentioned every piece being examined by the Ware- Mr. Douglas, house keeper previous to the delivery and his Eeport entered in their Diary. Satf 006 ** That agreeable to our Commands the Agent now proceeded to Bussorah and ^™g h h a a n Q and should fully comply with our Commands and had delivered the charge over to Mr. Lyster : That affairs were much the same when they last wrote us that thro' Messengers had been frequently going and coming to and from Shyrash affairs were not settled between Carem Oaun and Nassir Caun and Chat at their place oppression went on, in its old Channel. That 100 Bales of Broad Cloth were shipped on the Swallow for Bussorah and we would perceive by the Commander's Letter she could not take in more. That their Remains of Broad Cloth were 55 Bales and 5 pieces Medleys, 16 Bales and 2 pieces Drabs, 45 Bales and 2 pieces coarse, 18 Bales Middling, 6 Bales and 8 pieces Superfine, 21 Bales and 8 pieces fine, a bales and 8 pieces cased Medleys and 1 Bale French Fabrich. That Nasser Oaun had not cleared any part of his Debt and Nasir Khan 's debts. notwithstanding all his Promises they were dubious of him, and as this was the time for collecting the annual Revenues of Tarrsun, and he did not put it in way of payment, they should think they had some Grounds for their suspicions; That the People of that Kingdom and its Coasts being of a bad a Disposition, Europeans would find it difficult to live amongst them as formerly, unless they were determined to resent affronts. That they continued to keep their charges as low as possible, but from the Situation the Country was in at present the found it impossible to reduce them, without requiring the Hon'ble Company's Property, especially as they lived amongest People who only regarded the present and has neither honour nor honesty, who kept troops at the expense of the industrious and who paid no regard to the fair trade. That there want of cash obliged them to take up 12,000 Rupees from the Agent whom they had given Bills on us for the same and that they had received 900 Maunds of wool from Carmenia. ex. Public Department Diary No. 37—1761. Bombay Castle, 18th September 1761.[ Came in the Nancy Ketch John Oraggs Master from Muscat hy which Gombrooii, fetter received a letter from Mr. Dymoke Lister at Gombroon dated the 11th May Moid., ai. advising toat Jafler Oaun being informed the Arabs were making preparations146 Arabs preparing to attack Gombroon. Jaffer Khan preparing for defence, and asks for British gune, a request evaded. Karim Khan's movements. to attack that Town, had begun to make an inner wall to it the old one being too large to defend with the Troops he had, that the new wall joining to the House they dwelt in Jaffer Oaun insisted on their defending that part of the Town in case the Arabs came, which was not the only Inconvenience attending it for as the wall was to be as high as the house he, Mr. Lister, should be obliged not only to keep the major part of the Military under arms but also to raise the wall of the house, lest Jaffer Caun should be induced to make an attemp t on them. That Jaffer Caun having sent to him for two Guns for the Defence of the Dutch Factory, he had informed him whenever disposed of any and that there were no more than just sufficient for the defence of the factory but he was very pressing he wou'd return them, but as the lending them must irritate the Arabs he endeavoured to evade complying therewith by putting him in mind of the solemn Agreement he made with the Agent continue in Friendship, on which he seemed to be easy but said if the Arabs did come he believed he must be under the necessity of having one at least, and that he was afraid he would oblige him to let him have the one if not both, as it was in his power without using hostile measures to compell him to a compliance, by depriving him of wood, water and all kinds of necessaries, but that to prevent either him or the Arabs reducing to immediate want he had lain In one month's wood and water. That he had received advice from Carmenia, that Oarim Cauns general using great oppressions caus'd many villages to revolt and that on sending most of his troops to reduce them, Tagueby Sultoun one of the revolters took the opportunity of surprising the city and that Conde Moured Caun the general assembling what men he could in the city was kill'd in the skirmish and Mirza Allassen with the consent of Taguegby Sultour was appointed Governour. That Carem Caun was at Tairoun and Hussan Caun Governour of Istraband had revolted from him and as troubles were also broke out in Tairoun they imagined under its present Governour would be restored to its Former Tranquility and Trade that since the Agent's departure for Bussorah he had read, a letter from Nassier Caun apologizing for his not having any part of the Loan and acquainting him of his intention of coming to Taurom to collect Tairouns taxes, out which he said the loan should be paid and men tioned by private advices from Lhor, that Nasseir Caun had received the news of Messey Saltouns death who resided on Shyrack on his part, and that the Ohoppars who came from thence to obtain a hostage for the treaty the negotiating were received very coolly by him, and refus'd to send any of his relations there on that account, who thereupon went away much disgustes leaving no hopes of an accommodation between him and Caun taking place. That no opportunity had offer'd of disposing of any woollens. CXI. Public Department Diary No. 37—1761. Bombay Castle, 27th December 1761. Gombroon, L. from. Came in a Dingey from Mascat by which received two letter from Mr. Dymok Lyster. The first bore date the 1 October and advised that the Banimine Arabs had for some time been endeavouring to procure Jaffer Cauns Eemoval from147 that place and bad sent some of their Chiefs to obtain the same from Nassui Caun that they might bring their families from Ormus where they coald not subsist for want of water, and Nassur Caun being desirous of having them under his Government hearkened to their proposals of sending a person which he knew to be faithful to him and Friend and relation to the Benimines, all which circumstances induced Jaffer Caun rather than be order'd out of bis Government to write to his brother for permission to see his family at Lhor which was readily granted him and Hodgee Ally Morviagin sent to take charge of the Government during, as they then said, his absence and that JafPer Caun set out accordingly with money and rich presents to present Nassur Caun hoping to regain his Government, he having a little before his departure forced great sums from the inhabitants, particularly our Brokers and had since his being at Lhor frequently wrote he was coming, but Nassur Caun did not seem willing to grant him permission &amp; by private letters to your present Governour and Chiefs seemed convinced that his proceedings there had injur'd the place for which reason he did not intend letting him return and recommend it to him to recover the place out of its drooping stage by encouraging the merchants and as many Arab families as possible to settle there at same time desiring him to send him any sum that the Chief of landun might pay as tribute to him which had been complied with notwithstanding Jaffer Caun had wrote to Governour there to keep it on his account and by appearances there seemed tio be no likelihood of his return, and hopes if the place being able to recover itself under the present Governour, he being the very reverse of the former. Nasir Khan That Nassur Caun had concluded a peace with Carem Caun whereby he was S K^im Khan. confirmed Beglerbeg of the Hot countries on conditions of annually paying two thousand Tomaunds and keeping 100 Musquetteers as Shyrash also employing his Forces for the service of Carem Caun in the Hot countries. In consequence there of having collected all his troops he sett out for Lhor and reduced the people of Naatpaschavar and Ajchanoum to his obedience compelling them to submit to such terms as he prescribed and then returned to Lhor and from thence wrote the Chiefs of lairoun to pay him his tribute immediately or he should serve them in like manner as those of Anatt and that hitherto they had only returned evasive answers sending small sums of money and presents hoping to delude him, which he seem'd determined not to be, having in several letters wrote he should set out the 18th October for Tauroun. That the Benimine Arabs in consequence of their agreement with Nassur Caun had brought most of their Families to that place and as they were reduced to poverty by their war with the Jalfar Arabs. They were continually on the watch to plunder Beni Main Arabs anything that might come in their way and was it not for such a wary Man fS^foom as the present Governour he said, they wou'd soon play some tric k there specially with the English as they had not been backward in using their endeavours for that end. That Moola Ally Shaw was gone to Juffar in order to get the assistance of the Arabs there in the recovery, as his family were kept prisoners in the Castle and that Carmenia by the latest advices Mulla Ali Shaw continued to be in confusion as the Calentar who was made Governour of the 10 Htv Tending several disaffected people to Jangy Beg Sultaun, endeavoured Ja ] far Arabs in v •' * 0 , . j i , order to capture to sett up for himself, but in an engagement was defeated and taken Prisoner Ormuz. the merchants were chiefly ruined and the Linguist finding it impracticable to stay there with any degree of safety requested he, Mr. Lyster, wou'd write to Tangy Bego give him permission to come to that place which was granted148 and the wool being 3,000 Maunds all chiefly come to hand and that learning by- inland advices of some differences having arose between Fatally Caun and Ally Caun which came to an open rupture and that the former went against the latter and Shaik Ally Oaun, Gaum Cauns General embraced that opportunity and surprized Tabreez and of Gaum Gauns being at Saboulouse, Fattaly Oaun and his troops at Ardevelle and Shaik Ally Gaun with Gaum Gauns Forces at Hame- doon watchg each others motions but that no engagement had ensued. That advices from Gorazoon gave an account of Ahmed Shaws having given orders to his general to have the Sijtoun roads cleared for troops for that he intended coming into Persia in consequence of Tangy Gaun having put himself and Garmenia under his protection and that he had confirmed him Sardaz and his be other Ahmed Sachyabar and Gaun of Garmenia and that the Agent stay at Bussorah being much longer than was imagined they had left him quite bare of cash and had therefore taken up four thousand Rupees to defray the current expenses having received advice from him that neither the affairs of Bussorah * nor his health wou'd permit of his quitting that place till the beginning of that jf month and that he had given Bills for the same in favour of Messrs. Drapor f and Boddan and the other was under thtj^l9th November enclosing duplicate of the above which the war between the Arabs had prevented being sent that in his last he acquainted us of the Garmenia wool being all safely arrived but that the Linguist there being so dangerously ill as not to be able to translate the Garmenia Linguists Accounts which accompanied it and that the Garmenia Linguist had not advised him in his letter of having drawn for Shas 162, 495 5 on account the Wool Investment and which had not come to his knowledge till the Bill was tendered him for acceptance and the Linguist there delivering a translate of those Accounts, he had deferred bringing them on the Books till the Agents arrival that he might consider them but the Bill on Account the Honourable Company's Gredit he had excepted and had taken up of the Agents cash 16,250 Rupees for which he had given Bills on us in favour of Messrs. Draper and Boddam and that he had since been informed that the reason of his the Garmenia Linguist not noticing the drawing of said Bill was owing to the hurry and trouble he was in getting from Garmenia. That he daily seeing money paid to Nassur Gaun and no notice taken of any part of the Loan made him he consulted with the Linguist whether or no it wou'd be prudent in him to remind Nassur Gaun thereof by sending a Gossid to Lhor with a Latter setting forth, that as he had directed him to make application to him for any assistance he could give and he had great occasion for money. Trade very dead and the Agents stay much longer than expected requested he wou'd give him an order on the Governor there for some, which the Linguist was of opinion would have no bad effect whatever it might have on the contrary, when accordingly a Gossid was sent who returned with an Order upon the Governour for 50 Tomaunds and which he accordingly received and also an Offer of Supply of Grain or any other Produce of his Territories if there was a Want of it. That Moolah Alley Shaw had with the assistance of the Julfar Aii te Shaw 0 on Iulla -^ ra ^ 8 made an attack on Ormuse, but after some skirmishes with the Benimine Arabs and 0rmllse P eo P le w a s oblig'd to quit the place, that the Julfar ^M d ^ArabB y Arab . s . notwithstandin g tllis check after hariug supplied themselves with and Ornmz people. Provisions made another attack on the Castle and had been obliged to quit the place. That during the above transaction a dingey from Muscat laden with149 goods belonging to several Merchants of that place, also 2,400 Bags of Eice PIrac y t&gt;y which he, Mr. Lyster, had ordered to be purchased there for the Hon'ble Arab8 Company's use, also a Leaguer of Arrack which the Agent order'd to be caught for the use of the ^Factory before the arrival of the Swallow, was taken by the Julfar Arabs and appropriated to their use tho* he immediately applied to Moolah Alley Shaw on the occasion, who denied any knowledge thereof and declar d that whatever property fell in his hands belonging to the English shou'd be faithfully restored. Being sensible tho' too late what hurt he had done himself in breaking with the English, notwithstanding which on arrival of the Muscat ships our Broker rec £ an accot of said Rice and Arrack with the dingey and Noquedahs Name and in sending a person privately over to Kishme found the Leaguer of Arrack on the Beach and learned that Moola Ally Shaw had turned the Rice to his own use taking and destroying all letters and papers which the Noquedah had but which Mr. Lyster said was not all, of his proceedings for that whenever their Trankey went for wood he made her first supply the Romania with it afterwards with water. That Moolah Alley Shaw having seized the above mentioned Rice obliged him to apply to Nassur to give him an Order for some Rice of his that laid there or send some from Lhor, and as he said there seemed to be but little probability of his recovering his debt in money thought it prudent to do it, in any commodity he could get, as Rice was an article he was under an absolute necessity of procuring for the garrison and hoped the difference of taking it from him wou'd not be so great which from his former letter he did not doubt of being supplied with. He said that in respect to the Government there it was much alter'd for the better as it was certain that Jaffer Caun was not to return and Hadjee Ally publickly confirmed Governour, who certainly answered the character he had given him in his last and mentioned small Coffilas of provisions coming in delay as they were permitted to sell their goods to the best bidder, had nothing extorted from them, the Governour being very careful himself of not setting a bad example. That by the last accounts from Carmenia they were in much want of merchandize and the demand for goods was great and it was thought some merchants wou'd come down to carry Goods notwithstanding the great risque they run in carrying them up Country and as perpets was now generally in demand and we shou'd send there any more goods, he commended our sending some as there were none in warehouse except a few pieces of such colours as were not to the liking of the people the colours in demand he said were the several Green Scarlet Purple and Blue and that the Broker had told him that Iron and Lead was also wanted there. He mentioned Mr. Walter Douglas having died there the 7th November enclosed his account Remains of Woolens in Warehouse. That he had with difficulty procured a boat to go with these advices to Muscat as he thought it necessary to acquaint us with the situation of affairs there not having wrote us for a considerable time when he said was entirely owing to want of opportunities and that it would have been impossible to get the above mentioned Boat out of that port if it had not been for the Muscatters being there. That he had directed Narrotun to forward these advices as soon as possibly and as the season for vessels going from thence to Bombay was come hop'd he wou'd soon have an opportunity of sending it without being obliged to freight a Boat on purpose.150 CXII. Public Department Diary No 37 of 1761. Bombay Castle, 8rd November 1761. We approve the Agent's intentions of removing to an Island in the Gulph upon his hearing from Bushire and impatiently expect his sentiments about removing from Gombroon and as by the last letters from thence, affairs appear to be in as bad or rather a worse situation before, we leave to them to remove to wherever in the Gulph they may think proper, should they find absolutely and immediately necessary for the security of the Company's property, and as Gombroon is so very unsettled they must endeavour to promote the vend of woollens as such as possible at any other port or ports in the Galph.

CXIV. Public Department Diary No. 87—1761. Bombay Castle, 25th November 1761. Gombroon, L. to. Sign'd our address to the Hon'ble Company to be transmitted in dupli cates via Bussorah the material Parts being as usual disguis'd in the large Cypher also letters to the Agent and Council at Gombroon Messrs. Douglas and Stuart at Bussorah, Messrs. Erskine and Nalsey at Scindy and sailing orders to the commander of the Drake. Our Letter to the Agent and Council at Gombroon acknowledged receipt of theirs of the 28th February and 9th April also one from Mr. Dymoke Lyster dated 11th that the Drake now pro- Nwir Khan b debts, ceeded to relieve the Swallow which Vessel was immediately order'd to return hither we expressed our concern at the little prospect they seemed to have of recovering Nassier Cauns Debt, but shou'd depend on their doing everything/Ts (hf) 151 in their Power for the recovery thereof and directed to avoid leading my money to the Country powers as much as possible. That agreable to their desire we had not sent them any Wollens, but would have them transmit an Account of what Goods they might have a prospect of setting in the present unsettled state of the Country, we ordered them to send the Drake Ketch immediately to Bussorah with an enclos'd packet for the Hon'ble Company, the original of which we ordered to be sent over the Desart and Duplicate by the way of Bagdad to Aleppo and order'd them to advise the Hon'ble Company of all occurrences worthy notice.. We order'd them to proclaim his most graci- Proclamation of ous Majesty George the Third and enclos'd them Copy of the Form use'd on George 0 iii. King that occasion and order'd them to take the oath of Allegiance to him and to administer both that and the oath of fidelity to all the Officers there, both Military and Marine, we enclos'd them also a Copy of our Hon'ble Masters Commands of the 5 November and 31 December 1760 relative to their Place and directed Mr. Walter Douglas to remain there as Bencoolen was in the Enemy's possession. Their remains of Wool we ordered them to send per Swallow, but as old Copper was very low and likely to be still lower, We directed them not to send any if they cou'd avoid it and if they shou'd have remittances to make we directed them to do it in Gold or silver.

That from the Agent &amp; Council was dated the 24ith ultio. &amp; advised Gombroon, Letter their despatching the Swallow with all the Carmenia Wool in warehouse from ' amount to Sbahees 223 &gt; 667'7. That the Hon'ble Company's Orders not reach- ino- Carmenia till more than half the Investment was sent away, occasioned the red sorts of the quantity now sent not being separated &amp; by the best information they could get Broad Cloth &amp; Perpets were in demand in the Inland parts though the Bevolutions at Carmenia had prevented any merchants The b«t_ te comins there. That two Bales of Hing which were forced on the Carmenia Persian Gulf Linguist by the Government was now sent and agreeable to our orders the Bu9h,Ie - Agent bad reconnoitered all the ports in that Gulph the best of which for Trade was Busbire, which at that time was full of inland merchants who seemed to have entire liberty to buy sell or export their goods when they thought proper &amp; he was of opinion by sending a covenant servant there it would turn to account, the present Governonr bearing an excellent character and seemingly desirous of our settling there &amp; had wrote the President on the subiect, which letter was inclosed. The Agent mentioned one conveniency tending Bushire, that a Person there need have no connections or caress any ^e but the Shaik himself and proposed having no very considerable amount sent at first until some trial had been made how affairs would turn out. That Sen ,, 0 { the Town was surrounded by water &amp; that towards the land with a wall &amp; mounted with good cannon he thought the expenses152 could not be great. They remarked tliat was the Government of Gombroon in proper hands, it would be the best port in the Gulph fer the inland tradei its situation being proper for supplying many places with Woollens. They judged the Tin would sell from 20 to 25 Shahees the Eabreez Maund, as it was liked by the Persians, but as that commodity was imported by the Dutch and Private Traders they could not speak with certainty tho' believed that 1,500 maunds Fabreez might sell annually &amp; recommended its being in caps. That Marn Arabs° £ BeD1 the Benimine Arabs had brought all their Families from Carrack to Ormuse, but as to their settling at Gombroon it was doubtful. They said Carmenia was in no flourishing way, the village people being greatly oppressed &amp; was imagined would side with Nassir Caun. That they had returned by this vessel all the Military &amp; Artillery except one of the train and a Topass and were paid to the 30th ulto. &amp; by the first conveyance requested a supply of rice for their monthly expenses. By the last accounts from Bussorah they informed us Messrs. Shaw &amp; Garden had discharged no further part of their Debt the Balance being the same as advised &amp; Fort William &amp; by accounts trans mitted us from Bussorab. We would observe seventy two Bales of the con signment &amp; Admiral Pocock were remaining in Warehouse which the contractor had refused clearing alledging that they were paid for, which the late Resident denied so that until their accounts was settled, it could not be cleared up tho' they assured us it should be done as soon as possible. That Lieut. Stennett of the Swallow had left her at Bussorah and sent the Agent his commission. That not being able to supply the Swallow with Eice &amp; Ghee they had directed Captain Nesbitt to call in at Muscat, &amp; had wrote Narrotan to furnish her with those articles, taking the Commander's receipt. Adyantages of Gombroon. Gombroon, Letter from. Agent's proposal for settling at Bnfbiroconsidered. With respect to the Agent's proposal for settling at Bushire, we are of opinion, it will be more for our Hon'ble Masters' Interest and much more suitable to the present Situation of our affairs for the Agent either to proceed thither himself or to send Mr. Lyster with such goods as he may judge will answer, tho' if there be a prospect of a good Market and the Company 's Property not endangered thereby, he may be permitted to stay there in such a house as he may able to hire &amp; on being advised of the success which may attend this measure we shall then be able to judge of the expediency of settling there, tho' we are rather inclined to think the sending a vessel thither occasionally with such goods as may from time to time be in demand will answer better than having fixt residence of which however the Agent and Council must be directed to give us their sentiments. The President lays before the Board a Translation of the Letter enclosed to him from the Shaik of Bushire as entered hereafter, which is now read &amp; a copy thereof ordered to be sent to Mr. Douglas, in order for his settling such articles with him as he may be able &amp; it must also be remarked.

With the sincerest wishes for your Priendship I declare that the principal Motive to my writing this letter# is to enquire after Your Honour's health, and as I have always heard of Your Honour's good conduct^ I have enter tained a regard for you in my bresl, for which reason I have made the first advances and beseech Your Eriendship, some time ago I wrote a letter to Your HonourWAvhich I never received any answer^ though I always expected and EngUsh^to ^ttw ^30 still except onelacquainting you t^atas our Friendship was sure and lasting^ Buahire it would be proper to appoint the residence of the Agent for the English Company to be at Bushire; I only desire to manifest my regard for the Company's people : Now that Mr^ D^glas, Agen^for the English Company, has been in his return from Bussorai^at Bushire/ when we met and consulted together 11 have agreed sincerely, without dispute and with my free consent with the said Gentleman that the Company's Factory be established at this place, as it was formerly the goods of the English Company and those of their servants shall be exempt from paying Customs, every Branch of Trade shall be carried on as formerly. My wishes are for nothing else than the strengthening our Friend ship, and acquaintance or for the Company's profit, because all their goods are proper f (Sr this country. At present all the roads of Persia are by Bushire, merchants come from both coasts, to trade at this Port, yet oa account of their having no merchandize they go to other places and return to their own countries through this port. Had the Company a Factory here, they would enioy all the trade and dispose of all their goods, for thank God ta the Port of Bushire is in entire security, quiet and flourishing, and the roads for the Caravans are quite free from molestation. At present I have only thought proper to put your Honour in mind of me and invite you by the blessings of God bn the receipt of this letter, to accept my offers of service, and that you will please to appoint one of the Company's Agents to reside at this place, to carry on their Trade, with assurances that He may sell to^whom he will and buv from whom he will, you may also be certain that the affairs shall be carried on as you judge best for the Company's advantage. The desire of this Friend is that your Honour will by letters of encouragement and by your services remember me^that this Business may with the Blessing of God be put in execution tlmF whom I wish you all Honour and Riches, dated the 11th Beby of Sany 1175. CXVII. Public Department Diary No. 38 of 1762. Bombay Castle, 5th May 1762. Imported our Hon'ble Masters' Ship Eoyal Captain, Captain Nathaniel Gombroon, letter Tanner from Gambroon, by which received two Letters from the Agent and fr&lt; ' m ' 2578 P. D.154 Council &amp; one from the Eesident at Bussorah, with the several Papers as Per List of the Packet. The First from the Agent &amp; Council was dated the 13th February advising Eeceipt of our commands by the Drake Ketch, which they despatched to Bussorah the 2l8t January. That there was no Inland Trade carried on Bush^e^a port, in any Port in the Gulph between that place &amp; Bussorah except Bushire and that the other Islands on the Persiarn shore excepfcing QuisH and Bussel were uninhabited &amp; not one of them had an harbour to shelter ships from southerly winds &amp; therefore were at a loss on which to fix, tho' apprehended the more adjacent to Gombroon the better on account of its situation for trade» and if we come to Eesolution of removing to one of the Islands, we would send such a force as would prevent impediments &amp; obstructions from the Persian Government of which they wrote us under the 9 th April 1761 &amp; requested that everything else necessary might likewise be sent and that until the Inland Ports were a little more settled and the Roads open they could not write us for any certain Quantity of Woollens, &amp; by the best Advices they could get if the country was a HtMa settled the quantity remaining there would soon go off. That with regard to the Expenses of that settlement they beged leave to observe that there were no other constant Monthly charges than had been for many years past, and that if we should think anything unnecessary they would order them to be struck off. They enclosed a state ment of the monthly Expenses of that garrison with a List of such servants as were kept in monthly pay, and that any orders we might issue for the Reduc tion of their charges should b© strictly adhered to; and that their utmost endeavours would be exerted to recover Nassir Caun's Debt who had been at Lhor some time past which had prevented their applying to him as the doing debt' Khan 8 it when he was in the Fields was of no signification tho' as soon as he returned the necessary application would be made. They informed us that the Resident at Bussorah had been directed by the Drake to send attested copies of the 'Accounts. We had ordered, and transmitted us copies of such accounts as had been sent thither at Times. That on the 3rd February Jaffer Caun came to Gambroon. IS either Hadjee Ally, the late Governor, or any one else knew of his coming &amp; could not learn the reasons of Nassir Caun's replacing him in the Government of that place, tho* after having taken the most Solemn Oath that if the Benimines would bring their Families to Gambroon; he would never admit again of Jaffer Oaun's being Governour &amp; on that con sideration alone, some of the Chiefs had brought their Families there, and to their great surprize found themselves trepanned and what turn afPairs would take on that account, they could not pretend to say, however Nassir Caun for the present on hearing the Julfar Arabs had assembled a large body of men at Loft had sent Jaffer Caun &amp; that as he himself proposed coming to Gombroon had directed Jaffer Caun to provide provisions for his troops tho' that appeared to them all a deceit they being well assured he was to return to Lhor. That as from the prudent management .of Hadjee Ally, people daily return to Gombroon, they had great reason to think that place would again flourish &amp; remarked that Nassir Caun was not to be relied on and that Hadjee Ally was much shagreened at the change, as he was a great means of getting the Benimines to settle there. They acquainted us they had received no Inland Advices since their last, &amp; requested a supply of a stationary. In a Post- cript they mentioned that in the year 1752 or 1753 when Nassir Caun came twice to Gombroon there were accidental charges on that account &amp; which Eemoval of Hadji Hi, late Governor of Gombroon, and return of Jaffer Khan.165 they had been liable to of late years from People Ie Government, which however should be avoided as much as possible. CXVIIL JExtract, paragraphs 77 and 78, of Despatch, dated 16th April 1762, from the Court of Directors. 77. We are sorry to find Nasseer Caun has forced from our Servants at Gombroon 1,000 Tomaunds under the pretence of a loan which they say was ^Te^thdriwn 7 complied with to save what effects we had there. We are now thoroughly and onl y a convinced from all the advices that the continuing a settlement at that place keep up the British must under the present circumstances be attended with such risk as will be no flag ' ways adequate to any advantage we can possibly receive, all that we apprehend necessary for the present is to keep a Linguist there in a small house to be hired from the Country People. The vessel that carries the cloth to Bussorah may call there to carry advice from thence of the situation of the country to the Presidency. The Captain or no one else are to land any goods from the ship, nor is he to go on shore as our views are only to keep a footing that the first opportunity may be embraced to resettle when we see tranquility prevails in the country. 78, We observe from your advices that you had empower'd the Agent and Council of Gombroon to remove to any place in the Gulph where our property may be secure, and in the Gombroon letter of the 9th of April following it appears the Agent intended to view some of the Islands in his way to and from Bussorah for that purpose, but whatever his report may be, we hope you have not proceeded therein, as we expect and direct that you take no step of this kind without first obtaining our permission, there being no encouragement at present to be at any expence in making new settlements in that Gulph, and therefore until you can establish our affairs at Persia in safety, tranquility and with prospect of advantage we recommend | that you totally withdraw that Agency and maintain only our Linguist at Gombroon who may keep up our flag as was done for many years at Carwar. ***** ^ CXIX. Public Department Diary No. 39 of 1762. Bombay Castle, 2nd September 1762. Imported the Monmontli Ketch Joseph, Price Master from the Gulph of Persia by which received three letters from the Agent &amp; Council at Gombroon, dated the 9th May, 5th &amp; 6th ultimo. The Eirst was purposely to advise their having received Notice of a Gorabroon ' Spanish War from the Kesident at Bussorah and in order that we might get * this intelligence as soon as possible, they had directed Narrotan at Muscat to Carmanta a . gnant transmit it by a Boat Express should no vessel offer from thence for this place. The Second advised their having sent to Bussorah the goods received by the Eoyal Captain for that market and that very few merchants had been at Gombroon from the inland parts. As the amount sales to them from August last did not exceed 25,000 Rupees and the sum total of their sales for that time was only 36,020 Rupees the Multan merchants who used formerly to deal largely156 Jaffer Khan's oppressions. ' Nasir Khan's debts. Basrah affairs. in Woolens having of late made no purchases owing chiefly to the badness of the Government at Garmenia to which place all goods purchased for Corazoon Mushad, Candahar, &amp;c., first went, and as the Government people there had for some time past taken from the merchants the goods carried from Gombroon at their own prices, giving them in payment what they pleased, and with that &amp; other oppressions discouraged the merchants and did not find the Oorazan or other merchants had been at Oarmenia for many months past &amp; there seemed to be a stagnation of trade there. That Ahmad Oaun, brother to the Sardar of that place with about fifteen hundred men had made a tour round those territories fleecing the farmers &amp; in April returned to the city &amp; by the last accounts from thence mentioned his being against Barn. That the country powers round them were still at variance destroying &amp; plundering each other and Jaffer Oaun, the Governor of that placs, still continued his oppressions and only a few Mullanees having anything remaining it fell very heavy on those who served the Hon'ble Company and if tkey were continued it would be impossible for any people of Credit to stay at Gombroon, as they seemed particularly pointed at and the Agent had used every method possible to remove these oppressions but unless they were in a condition to protect the Hon'ble Company's Property and those serving under them they were afraid they would still be continued as at present nothing kept them within tolerable bounds. Knowing they had it in their power to oppress, &amp; not being sure their Government would continue long which had reduced the town to a few Oajan Huts &amp; not many wealthy people remaining nor sea customs coming in and lent a trifle from the land, &amp; the Governor wanted to maintain the grandeur of a Persian Caun, send money to his family at Lhor and answer the Demands his brother Nassir Caun made on him. That Nassir Caun had made many excuses for not discharging his Debt &amp; they thought no dependance eould be placed on him, &amp; they believed the former oppressions as well as those then practised, were with his approbation and consent. They acquainted us they had received no advices from Bussorah since May but mentioned that a Eeport had been spread there of the Portuguese have joined us and they were assured of the death of Soliman Bashaw of Bagdad &amp; that the people were waiting for orders from Constantinople for appointing a new one. They requested we would send them some Elints. The Third mentioned that a Boat had arrived there with a Letter from the Resident at Bussorah, copy of the Material Paragraphs of which they enclosed us, as also the Musters of Broad Cloth brought by an Aleppe Caravan, but in Letters the Agent had received from thence no mention was made of the Portuguese having joined us. That Shaik Suliman had blocked up Bussorah Eiver with his Gallivats, declaring he would let no Boats go up or down. In a Postcnpt they informed us that Messrs. Shaw and Garden had not discharged any more of their Debt to the Company to the 9th July. cxx. Public Department Diary No. 39 of 1762. Bombay Castle, 26th October 1762. Translate of a copy Translate of a copy of a letter, endorsed inEcglish purporting to be from the Shaik of Bushire of Letter from the Shaik of Buehire. of Letter from the to Mesander Douglas, Esquire, and received at Gombroon the 9 th September and at the 19th October, but there arc no names, in Persian writing from whom, and to whom is wrote nor is it dated.157 After compliments,— I was honoured with your friendly letter together with one from the Governor, in good time and am greatly rejoiced to hear of your welfare for the better cultivation of our Friendship. When you and I was met we had talked about your settling an English Pressing tbe E. Sarkar Factory in this Port of Bushire and we both did then write about it to BusWref leat the Governor who was pleased to write me a letter in answer thereto, saying that it was necessary for him to know what sort of an Agreement I would make and what immunitys I would grant; which I should inform him, and that he had left this business to you, and you would send a man to me to know my offers or agreement, but Sir, this is a long time since I have seen your man. I did write an answer to the Governor of this purport, ms., that the Agreement is this, that the English Sarkar's goods are freed from this Government's customs, and no body here would have anything to do with their goods. That this port of Bushire they might take to be theirs, and is in no shape stranger to them. Further more that this Port and Eran, has a concurrence goods are always coming from Eran to this place and going from this place to Eran. Several sorts of the goods that go to Bussorah are always purchased by the Eran Merchants and carryed to Eran thro 1 Bushire it bein» their road for their coming and going. Please God when you have a Factory here, you will be convinced that it turns to your great advantage. I now send enclosed herein a letter to the Governor, which I desire you will please to forward to him, and write him what you may think most proper on the subject. Believe me we are fast friends and such you will always let me know your welfare, and lay any of your Commands this way on me, that our Friendship may be more and more fast. CXXI. Alex. Douglas to the Presidency. Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, My last respects was under the llth September via Muscat, and the Gombroon, L. Nancy Snow calling in here gives me an opportunity of sending sundry from * Acco^L. Books and papers as P List of the Packet. Your Honor, etc., was advised in my last of the situation [of the Hon'ble Company's Affairs at Bussorah on the death of the late Resident, and in the Diary page 182 you will please to observe, what the Provisional Eesident since that time wrote hither on the subject enclosed goes two acco^. currents between the Hon'ble Company, and Mr. James Stuart drawn out at different times by Messrs. Garden and Lyster and the enclosed Bussorah calculate of quick stock shows what he stands indebted the 10th ultimo the accompanying Bussorah cash accounts likewise shews what has been rece'd since his death. By Acco-Ls. from Bussorah it appears no money has been rece'd on account Messrs. Shaw &amp; Garden their Debt to the Hon'ble Company. For some time past we have heard nothing material regarding Carem Caun, he is said to be before Boumia where he has besieged Fatally Caun.158 Affairs this way continue much in the same situation as for some time past and most of the inhabitants reduced to a very low ebb. Jaffer Caun after many fruitless attempts to avoid going to Lhor was obliged to set out the 10th ultimo and Nassir Oaun now makes a merit of removing a man who was odious to the whole place, but the real cause was he wanted to get from Vn'm what he had fleeced the inhabitants of, and its generally thought he will not leave him worth a single Eupee, after which its not improbable but he may send him here again to get more it appears to me that Nassir Caun and all his relations are a bad race of people, neither oaths or any thing else are the least binding, and their chief art consists on chicanery, and if any one in their districts is possessed of a single rupee, they will have part of it, in short its difficult to manage with them. Nassir Caun for the present has appointed Jaffir Caun's father-in-law Governour here a man of an avaricious disposition and one who, I am apt to think, would not let slip an opportunity of enriching himself and as we have such a set of people to deal with am obliged to act with greatest caution to prevent many evil and bad consequences, its the same to them who they fleece so they but get the cash. Peace is concluded between Moolah Ally Shaw, the Julfar and Benemine Peace concluded Arabs, the latter are to keep Ormuse and be put in possession of Loft Eort and Shaw MidtheJtd&amp;t to ^ ave ^ ands ® aBsi(iore an( i tt 16 revenues of the Island this time to A~abf eDiMain divided between the three. The Shaik of Julfar keeps possession of the Ship Eahmanny. Last month the Benemine Arabs surprized Custack a sea Port belong ing to Sherriary and immediately wrote Jaffir Caun to send some soldiers to garrison it, as they had taken it for his brother. This affair was done to show their attachment to Nassir Caun in hopes he would give them the Government of Gombroon but by the best accounts I can learn he has no such designs, nor will he part with this place. It is said Nassir Caun has agreed to allow the Benimine Arabs an annual pay on condition they carry on no trade but only cruize in the Gulph and act according to his orders which, if true, they will soon become common free booters, and it is further said in order to secure them to his interest, he is to marry a daughter of the late Abdul Shaiks and that 'eer long he will come here for that purpose. I have received no wool from Carmenia but by what the Linguist writes it may be soon expected. Tou will please to observe that all letters rece'd from Bussorah since the death of Mr. Stuart to this time are entered in the Diary pages 164, 165, 182, 190,194,199. I am with respect, Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, Your most obedt. hble, servant, ALEXANDER DOUGLAS. G ombroon. 9th Felruary 1763. Rec'ed 2nd March p. Nancy. No. ft7. Jaffer Khan recalled from Gombroon.159 CXXII. Alex, Douglas to the Presidency. Hon'blb Sir and Sirs, Your Commands by the Prince of Wales and Drake I received the 26th Withdrawal of the ultimo and shall now proceed to advise your Honour, etc., of all transactions GombroonT since that time. The small packet for the Hon'ble the Court of Directors I despatched per Boat express to Bussorah &amp; the other was enclosed to the provisional Agent &amp; Co. per Swallow. The Hon'ble Company's woolen goods remaining at Gombroon at the time of the abovementioned vessel's arrival was 326 Bales and cases which have been all loaded on board a Tranky and consigned to Bussora and amounts to Shahees one million three hundred and seventy four thousand five hundred and thirty two and one Goz as per Invoice entered in the journal, p a 42. I called on Captains Lindsey and Nesbit to know the quantity of bales each cou'd receive on board the vessels they commanded. The former informed me he could receive none and the other mentioned he could take no more than four hundred and as there was between eight and nine hundred to be sent to Bussorah in obedience to your orders freighted two Trankeys to carry the remainder and the accompanying account how the number of packages delivered by the Commander agrees with your accounts. Having in cash a parcel of Mamoodies which we had been obliged to receive from people in power and knowing they would not pass current in India, I thought it most for the interest of my Hon'ble Masters to send them to Bussorah and accordingly consigned them to the Provisional Agent and Council per Swallow and amounts to Shashees forty five thousand and five hundred as per Invoice entered in the Journal p a 43. Not being able to sell the Hon'ble Company's Trankys I sent one of them per Drake Ketch and gave Mr. Jervis directions to dispose of her at any port he might touch at and account with the Provisional Agent and Council for the produce, the other I have directed Captain Court to take under his convoy in hopes of being able to sell her at Muscat where I learn he will call for water. The two Trankys loaded with the Hon'ble Company's goods I dispatched the 16th for Bussorah under convoy of the Drake and gave Captain Lindsey peremptory orders not to part Company with them till his arrival at the afore said port. The Swallow I dispatched the 18th and to this time have no advices of the Tartar Snow. As your Honour, etc., mentioned your designs of sending the Prince of 'Wales to England I judged it prudent to make as much expedition as possible and therefore dispatch her to you having loaded on her in cash to the amount of Shahees one million three hundred sixty one thousand one hundred sixty one nine Goz and a quarter as per Invoice and Bill of Lading enclosed. Such stores as was sent on board her from the Factory the account is enclosed and for which the Presidency is debted as well as for what on board the Drake as per journal p 8 47 &amp; 49. The present Nayeb or Deputy Governor declaring publicly he would impede to the utmost of his power several under our protection from leaving be place likewise hinting we should not remove ourselves and positively160 refusing to pay any part of what he and others in Government had at times forced from the Hon'ble Company tho* they had wherewith to do it &amp; my being well informed, the said Nayeb and others in Government had the major part of their effects in the house formerly belonging to the Dutch, but which for near three years past had been garrisoned by and in possession of the Persians made me come to a Eesolution of getting possession of it in hopes thereby of being able to secure something to the Hon'ble Company for the late oppressions they had met with as also to secure a safe retreat for our people should the Persians endeavour to impede us, which would have been difficult from our house it being distant from the water side and surrounded with houses and walls. Accordingly on the 4th instant an attempt was made and after about an hour and a half contest our people succeeded but unluckily for us the Persians during the attack got most of their valuable effects away thro* an embrazure at the west end of the house the Nayeb's wife and family escaped the same way, which proved a great disappointment being well convinced if they had been secured, I should have been able to have got the Hon'ble Company sufficient recompense for all past oppressions, they being very rich having been associates with Jaffar Gaun in all his oppressions and I may say this Nayeb was a great promoter of all tbe hardships we went through in Jaffer Caun's time. The European Military being few it was judged necessary to have some assistance from the Prince of Wales accordingly Captain Court was called on to land agreeable to Charter Party which he readily complied with and brought his ship into two fathoms and three quarters at low water but it proved too great a distance for the guns to do execution against the Persian Port. The Drake and Swallow anchored about three quarters of a mile from the shore and bombarded the Port, till the 5th in the morning when the Persians evacuated it and retired to Serou village distance of about one and a half on which our people took possession but found nothing of value in it they there fore spiked the Guns and burnt the carriages not being provided with materials to blow up the walls. We had killed three of the Prince of Wales Crew, four of the Military one of the Train and five sepoys. On the arrival of the Prince of Wales and Drake the Nayeb dispatched an express to Lhor to acquaint Nasir Caun that the English were upon some schemes but could not then discover their real designs. However, he requested that Caun would with the utmost expedition come himself to Gombroon with body of men or else send his relation to Cutwal, the day afterwards he dis patched expresses to Zeniel Sultan at Hodjeeab and requesting he would like wise send some soldiers. However none arrived so soon as was expected and it was not til the 7th in the morning that Captain Palmer sent me a message by Mr. Natter to acquaint me of his discovering about two hundred and fifty Horsemen. I therefore judged a reinforcement was arrived and accordingly ordered Captain Palmer to embark that evening with all his people and to send off whatever he could and as Captain Court had declared he could not get off the Cannon they were all except two spiked up and the carriages burnt which was no great loss most of them being honeycombed. Enclosed you will please to receive an account of what was taken from the Persians and give such Directions thereon as you may judge proper, they are Captain Court's care and the bags sealed with my seal.161 Knowing that Moolah Ally Shaw had spent all his ready money in main- aining for these three years past Shaik Kachid and his tribe of Arabs and that there would be nothing got by attacking him in his Port at Kishme made me determine to endeayour to get the ship Biahmanny, which vessel with her gun 8 would produce something accordingly I gave Captains Court and Xindsey orders to proceed to Loft in which harbour she lay and take her, but when we came to an anchor about the distance of two miles from her those gentlemen examined the pilot as to carrying in the vessels where she lay and after the examination Captain Court wrote me the enclosed Letter, and he representing the risque and dangers to be very great, I thereupon came to a Eesolution to dispatch the Drake with the two Trankys immediately to Bussorah and the Commander of the Prince of Wales was directed to return towards Gombroon where I had left the Swallow to advise the Tartar where we were gone to. Had we made an attempt on the Eort at the last end of Kishme we should have run great risque of miscarrying in the undertaking, the mortar on which we chiefly depended and which made the Persians evacuate the Port being unserviceable as you'l please to perceive by Lieutenant Durnford's Letter to me. The Drake and Swallow's Cannon we found at Gombroon did little or no execution against the walls, the weight of metal they carry not being of a sufficient bore for battering. Captain Nesbit having represented to me by letters of the ship Swallows being weakly manned and requesting a detachment of sepoys, I accordingly put on board her thirteen of the seepoys who came on this vessel from Bombay. The sepoys, etc., belonging to this place now return they have received their fish, etc., Money to the 20th ultimo and pay to the 31st January last. Enclosed is Captain Lindsay's receipt for—on board the Drake. I have received two pipes of Madeira wine from the Drake which I have not paid for not being advised of the price. My constitution being greatly impaired thro' my long residency in this Eetirement of Alex, unhealthy place which I have little chance of recovering but in my native Dougla8 ' climate and Your Honour, etc., not having thought proper to put in immediate excution the Hon'ble Company's orders regarding me, these considerations have induced me to return to my standing at the Presidency and to decline going to Bussora under a Junior servant, and on the Terms you have been pleased to mention I have received my salary to the 31st July last inclusive and servant's wages to the 20th ultimo as to Diet Money I have received none since the Public table was taken off in April 1761 and therefore leave your Honour, etc. 5 to make me such an allowance as you may deem reasonable. I have received nothing for passage money and as such desire you will please to order what has been usual to persons in the same post. I am with respect, Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, Your most obedt. humble Servant, ALEXANDEE DOUGLAS. Ship P rince of W ales, G ombroon R oad, 10th March 1763.

I am, Sir, Tour most humble servant, THOMAS DUNFOKD, Lt., Fire Worker, G ombroon; 16th March 1763. cxxiv. Extract * of a letter from Commission &amp; Instructions to Mr. William Andrew Price, Provi sional Agent of Persia, dated 22 January 1763. The conduct of Mr. 'William Shaw, late Eesident at Bussorah, havino- SI r ofMessrs® r endered it necessary to order an Enquiry into the situation of our Hon'ble Shaw and Garden .i Masters' affairs there to be set on Eoot, a Committee of the Board was ap pointed for this purpose, under the 13 th Tebruary 1761, and in consequence of their Report laid before us the 27 fh of the same month, we deemed Ml- Shaw so highly culpable in the detention of the Drake and Swallow contrary to our express orders, that we resolved to remove him immediately, from the management of affairs there, and appointed MJL James Stuart, to be his successor therein, but as our Hon'ble Masters had severely censured MJL Shaw's conduct, in respect to the transmitting Overland Advices, and ordered an enquiry to be made into the cause of their miscarriage, which as well as the necessity of his journey to Bagdad, could only be properly done upon the spot, we ordered M^ Alexander Douglas to proceed to Bussorah, to make the necessary Enquiry into these points, and to acquaint us with the result ; Mess£L Douglas and Stuart accordingly proceeded to and arrived at Bussorah Note.—On. the 2l8t July 1762, James Stuart who had been placed by Alex. Douglas in the month of Ostober preceding in temporary charge of the Bussora Eesidency, died suddenly ; On receiving intelligence of this event. Alex. Douglas on the 11th August 1762, sent Dyraock Lyster, one of the Council of the Factorv of Gombroon, to Bussora, with instructions to conduct the management of the Company's affairs at that place until a successor to James Stuart had been appointed by the Bombay Government; Oa receiving this intelli gence Government appointed William Andrew Price, then in Bombay, &lt;c Provisional Agent of Persia ' and directed him to proceed forthwith to Bussorah. Orders were at the same time issued for the removal of the Gombroon Factory to Bussorah.163 the May 1731, and acquainted us, under the 13^. July following, that the Balance due on their arrival from Messli Shaw and Garden to our Hon'ble Masters was Tomans 15,078-25-50 in part of which those Gentlemen had to that time made good the sum of Tomaunds 2 J 760-46ms -40 fence and were then indebted Tomaunds 12,317-79-10, and which by advices since received, we find has been reduced to Tomaunds 11,807-2-10, and whicl by Letters and accounts hitherto come to hand appears to be the Balance due from Mess r JL Shaw and Garden at this time. Afiairs being thus circumstanced at Bussorah and Ml. William Shaw having represented that the only means of enabling him and M L. Garden, to discharge this very large debt to the Honorable Company was to afford him proper countenance and support in adjusting his outstanding concerns there, we have determined that you shall proceed to Bussora, to endeavour to recover the said Debt, and to afford M 1.

You are accordingly invested with the Presidents' Commission for these Purposes and Ml. Benjamin Jervis (who now proceeds) and M r ^ Dymoke Lyster already there, are as Factors to assist you in the management of affairs, agreeable to the Rules of the service, and for your better carrying our intentions into execution. 1 M y Douglas having on his arrival at Bussorah suspended M^ Robert Garden, from acting in the Hon'ble Company's affairs there, on account the large Balance of Cash due to our Hon'ble Masters, which we have since confirmed, he mutt continue in the same situation, until his and Ml, Shaw's affairs are finally adjusted, but he must be present at all examinations, wherein he may be in the least concerned, and be permitted to urge whatever be may deem necessary in his own defence. 4 Our Hon'ble Masters having been pleased in their commands of the Removal of the 16 — April last, to recommend to our consideration the removing the As-encv a g enc y from ' t-» i i o J Gombroon, from Gombroon to Bussorah, we have determined thereon, and agreeable to their commands now give M_L Douglas the option of being Agent, but as Ml. Shaw has through the whole of his correspondence, taxed that Gentleman in such a manner, as if just, renders him by no means a proper person to be concerned in the adjustment of Ml Shaw's Affairs or in the Enquiry you are ordered to make into some points of his conduct, and as his being Agent while these affairs are depending, might give Room for Mi-Shaw to allege hereafter, that his influence, and the countenance and support, he has all along shewn to Hodgee Eusuph in prejudice to him, was an insurmountale obstacle to the settling his affairs, and setting his conduct in a clear and just Light to us, we have determined that your shall take charge of our Honorable Masters' Affairs at Bussorah immediately on your arrival, and continue to manage the same, until your presence may be no longer necessary for settling M JL Shaw's affairs, or until further orders from hence, but as Mr. Douglas may accompany you to Bussorah, to produce such proofs, as he may judge necessary on the spot, for vindicating his character from the Aspersions thrown upon it by M1. 'William Shaw (for which purpose we now send him attested copies of the several charges laid against him by that gentleman), you are to behave to164 him in a polite and friendly manner, and afford him all the aceommadation which his Rank and station in the service entitle him to, affording him at the same time all the assistance he may require of you, in order to clear himself of the imputatioas la id to his charge, either by examining witnesses or by you interposition with the Government or others for procuring such proofs, as Douglas may represent to be necessary for that purpose, and the same conduct you will observe, with respect to MessH. Shaw and Garden—Mess£2.. Benjamin Jervis and John Tortesse now proceed to your assistance, having received their diet to the end of last month, salary to the 2nd instant, but not the allowance for their passage. MessIL Dymoke Lyster and John Sebastian Natter already in Persia, are likewise ordered to assist you agreeable to the Eules of the service, but as MJL.. Torlesse is only ordered tp accompany you on account of his bad state of health he is not to be concerned in the manage ment of affairs, notwithstanding his being a [Factor, but only to assist you, as you may see occasion, and to return with you to the Presidency; You are to embark on the Tartar whose Commander is orderd to receive, and entertain you in a manner suitable to your Hank and station in the service, and to proceed on her to Bussorah, with all expedition, to set about the enquiries ordered, carry ing with you as many of the Hon'ble Company's woollens, as you may be able touching however at Muscat for intelligence, and at Gombroon, to give any assistance which may be wanted there, which you are to afford, on M r Douglas' applying to you for the same, provided it may not require above a few days. While you are employed on this service, we permit of your keeping a Table at the Hon'ble Company's expence, in part of which you have been advanced four thousand ( 4,000 ) Rupees, and directed that at Bussorah every body live in one House, (if it can be done,) eat at one Table, and in everv respect keep up a perfect harmony, and as presents to the Government will be necessary on your first arrival, and perhaps too on any applications you may have occasion to make, we must acquiese therein, though at the same time, we must enjon you to the utmost frugality, in this, as well as in every article of expense, whatsoever, avoiding as much as you can all pomp and parade of any kind, which is constantly attended, with a very heavy charge as our Hon'ble Masters.'

From him I learnt that the English had taken and burnt Gombroon Fort, and pillaged the Town, that M £ Douglas afterwards proceeded to Loft on Kishme» with the Europe Ship and Drake to attack the Rahmanny, but had retired without attempting her, and made the best of his way to Bombay ; under these circumstances I was apprehensive, that Moollah Ally Shaw would not permit of our having a Pilot, nevertheless as the Vessel's going without the Island, instead of between Kishme and the Main, might make a material difference in her Passage, Resolved to attempt it, weighed anchor accordingly and proceeded to Kishme making the usual signal for a Pilot, in about half an hour, I was agreeably surprized by a Boat coming on Board from Moollah Ally Shaw, with a present of Fowls, almonds &amp; c ^ and a Pilot who conducted us between Kishme and the Main, with great skill and safety, of which I gave him a certificate, as we approached the Persian Ship, she politely hoisted her colours.'

SlE, The Honble the President and Council of Bombay having recommended Appointment of it to me to fix a Residence at Bushire in order more particularly to introduce J er ^ is Resi ^t at the vend of Woollen Goods into the Kingdom of Persia, I now appoint you ^stmctions for Resident and deliver you a copy of such articles as have been settled between ^ guldauce '166 me in behalf of the Honble Company and Shaik Saddoon to which yon will shew a due attention taking proper care that they are not infringed as one point given up in the beginning will draw on further encroachments, though these people seem so sensible of the benefit that will accrue to the place from the English having a Factory here that I have reason to hope you will not meet with impedement or molestation in the course of your business. Being advised that a large caravan is shortly expected from Shyrash I have been induced therefrom as well as the pressing entreaties of the Shaik to land 384i Bales of Broad Cloth 148 Bales of Perpets and 4 chests of Tabbies and sattins being the sortments proper for the Persia Market Invoices of which are enclosed which I recommend to you to dispose of at the prices such goods usually sold for at Gombroon an account of which is enclosed but as it may be for the Honble Company's interest on our first settling here as well to invite the merchants from up Country as to discourage the Dutch at Carrack and others from bringing Wollens into the Gulph to lower those prices I must leave it to your discretion to act in the manner most conducive to these ends, observing in general that a large vend though attended but with small profit will always be satisfactory to the Honble Company which is very desirous of extending this valuable Branch of its Trade. As the money for your sales will be paid in different species both of gold and silver, a Shroff will be necessary to prevent any imposition. You are accordingly empowered to entertain one and in order to encourage him to a faithful discharge of his duty a shroftage of J per cent. A duty of 3 per cent is to be collected on all goods imported and exported by those trading under the Honble Company's protection, which you are to levy accordingly and carry the amount to their credit and in order to prevent any frauds or deceits in this respect you will observe by the 9th Article of the Agreement made with Shaik Saddoon that in case the Bushire merchants should purchase goods from any persons trading under the English Protection from the Factory a due account thereof is to be rendered to the Eesident for the time being, for which purpose one of his people is to attend at the weight and delivery of all goods so sold, and by the 11th Article none of the Shaiks subjects are to purchase goods from English ships or vessels in the Eoad. As the securing the Collection of the Hon'ble Company's Customs depends upon a due attention to these Articles, you must take care that you are properly enforced upon all occasions. The Honble the President and Council of Bombay having further permitted the collecting a Consulage for one per c 11 . on all English Trade, you are to levy it accordingly. Half the amount is allowed you and the other half is to be carried to the credit of the Agent of Bussorah. For protecting the Honble Company's Goods and giving a credit to their affairs I have landed an Artillery Officer 7 soldiers and Artillery People I have not any account to what time they have been paid at Bombay, but you may advance them money occasionally for their Expences. As I shall have occasion for your service at Bussorah I hope you will be able to dispose of the Goods now lodged with you upon the arrival of the Carravan or at least the greatest part of them. I shall send a vessel to carry you up on which you are to ship all the Company's Cash in your Hands but if any good conveyance offers in the interim you may put it on board and consign it to the Agent and Council. I leave in your hands Rs. 2,000 for carrying on your expenses in which you are to observe the utmost frugality and as from the observation I have167 made liere the people in Government are devoid of all Pomp and Parade it will be entirely unnecessary in yourself. You must be careful to procure a list of all woollens proper for the different parts of Persia together with the annual consumption which you are to transmit to the Agent and Council as opportunities offer with your monthly accounts. Quick Stock remains in Warehouse and Account of Goods wanted with such advices as may appear necessary. Stephen Hermit the late Linguist at Gombroon being a proper person to be employed in the same capacity here you are to entertain him accordingly his allownces must be left to be settled by the Governour and Council of Bombay. I have been informed that the Eussians import into the Northern Parts of Persia a sort of Medleys which are much esteemed : it will be of service to the Honble Companys if you can procure Musters of these Goods which I am led to think you may by means of the Linguist connections at Ispahaun, The Shaik having applied to me that an account of all goods bought or sold by the English may be rendered to him in order for his levying the customs on the Persian merchants, you are to take care that this is duly complied with not only as an act of Justice to the Government but to prevent all room for complaint or suspicion. I have directed the Linguist at Carmenia to send the Carmenia Wool in readiness directly to Bushire. You are to receive it according taking an exact account of the weight upon its arrival, I have also directed the Linguist to put a total stop to any more expenses on acct the H 0 Company.

Hon'ble Sir akd Sirs, I paid my address to your Honour etc.* last the 6th instant Duplicate of B^e. wh ich is enclosed, nest day Shaik Saddoon 's son coming on hoard the Tartar to invite me on shore I accompanied him according hemg treated with great rioliteness and civility he acquainted me it was the earnest desire of his father Khan brother of Karim Khan.Grant of priviipgea into consideration this proposal of the Shaiks together with your Honour etcs. (brother of shaikh instructions and having made the necessary enquiry into the state of affairs Nasu of Bushire). . n j ail( ^ an( j fl n di n g the whole country from Bushire to Tsphaun under the Command of one man ( Carem Gaun) which wou'd probably make the expense of Oarravans more easy and being likiwise assured of the merchants of Bushire themselves that there was not any risque in landing our goods there. I accordingly entered into a negotiation with the Shaik's son which as usual from the delays of these Eastern People took up several days and after all when we came to the point he confessed to me that he could not agree to some of the articles particularly that the Honble Company should have an exclusive right to trading in Woolen Goods without his .Father's consent, I therefore, dis patched the late Linguist of Gombroon Stephen Hermit to Shaik Saddoon with a set of Articles writing him a suitable letter upon the occasion directing the Linguist to insist strenuously upon that article regarding the Woolen Goods and in short to acquaint the Shaik I could not recede from any one of them, I have now the pleasure to acquaint your Honour etc. that although the Shaik started objections to some articles yet at length signed the whole writing me a letter at the same time in confirmation thereof. Copy of these * articles is enclosed and as I flatter myself they are advantageous for the Honble Company hope will meet your approval. The Shaik's son representing to me that some Bushire Merchants were gone to Juddah and other places to purchase Wollens I was obliged to consent to that part of the 2nd Article the Englisk being at liberty to sieze and confiscate any Woolen Goods which might be brought clan destinely to Bushire should not take place until four months from the date of the agreement. It being your Honour etc. intentions that in case of factory was established at Bushire the woollen Goods proper for the Persia Market should be taken on shore there myself and Mr. Jervis agreed to land the Broad Cloth Perpets Tabbies and Sattins being what remained at Gombroon and what intended for that place as more particularly mentioned in our general address to which I beg leave to refer to your Honour etc. and as a large Carravan was shortly expected from Shyrash and the Honble Company having a property so considerable at Bushire determined me to leave Mr. Jervis tbere in charge thereof together with an Artillery Officer and twelve Military for protecting the Honble Company's Goods and giving a credit to their affairs on our first settling which I hope your Honour etc. will approve of together with my instructions copy of which is enclosed. Bushire from its situation being about fourteen days from Shyrash and thirty from Spahaun promises extremely well for opening a large vend for woollens into the kingdom of Persia and the whole country in that route before noticed being under the Command of Carem Caun whose arms at present make a considerable progress and whom its generally allowed governs with great justice and moderation gives us good hopes of success. The people at Bushire are very different from most in the Gulph being of a mercantile turn and have several vessels of their own and as the Shaik has two ships two Gallivats and some Trankies, I think the Honble Company's property does not run any risque for in case of inquiry or oppression it is in our own power to obtain satisfaction. Moreover our landing the Woollens proper for Persia at Bushire instead of carrying them to Bussorah there is room to think will keep up the price there. The above considerations together with the advantage * See Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. X.169 offered by the Shaik added to the little expence attending a Residency at Bushire where all Pomp and Parade is quite unnecessary appeared to me too inviting not to be embraced and therefore I hope your Honour etc. will approve the steps I have taken I have only to add thereto that the Rains in this part of the world not being periodical and no vessels to be procured for transporting Goods but Trankies which are not only open but wretchedly bad in any blowing weather a vessel of about 100 tons Burthen with a Deck and Pique sail like the Dutch luggege Boats at Surat appears to me very necessary and as she may be made capable of defence by mounting 8 or 10 carriage Q-uns upon her she will be very serviceable in many respects especially for removing our surplus Cash at Bushire to Bussora as occasion requires. I have not been able to finish affairs at this place until now tomorrow morning I shall embark for Carrack and as soon as the vessels are watered (the water here excepting what is brought upon Asses and Camels at a distance which would be expensive being very bad) and wind will permit make the best of my way to Bussora.

JBasrah, October' 1763, Wednessday 1^—The Chaub having landed a number of men in the Doings of the Dawasha country and drove away the inhabitants, the Swallow returned with Kaab ' Shaik Ali on board without having been able to procure any dates in part payment of Mr. Shaw's debt. Thursday 13th —Understanding that the Chaub's people have got possession of the dates at Dawasha, which they will probably carry off and thereby prevent Mr. Shaw's getting his interest therein, I notified to the Government my intention of sending down the Swallow to prevent it, but the Mussaleem and all the Jans begged I would not have recourse to violent measures and they would give me a letter to the Chaub, with a Mumbashee on their parts. He wag despatched this day with a suitable letter from me upon the occasion. Saturday 16th —News arrived that the Bashaw's army was marched towards Hauisa, where they defeated part of the Benaleem arabs, and that the Bashaw was in person at a place called Uscn, from whence he proposed coming to Bussorah and. then proceed to attack Shark Soliman the Chauk Monday 17th —Not having received any answer from the Chaab, and being advised chat his people on heariug of the Bastaws approach ha7e quitted S883 F. D170 Dowosha, and left the dates, and many other effects upon the spot, which may be made away with resolved to despatch the Swallow to prevent it, at the sametime desired the Mussaleem would give me an order cn the present sub ject for delivering up our just rights and also some of his people compell them thereto, he gave me for answer that as the Bashaw was not so near, he had very little power as Governor and prudence would direct him to leave the authority of ordering to his superiors and as the Government of the city was now in the hands of Hodgee Esuf, if I could agree with him, whatever should be resolved upon, he, the Mussaleem would carry into execution. In con sequence of which I sent for H odgee Esuf, and having represented the affair to him and the necessity there was for coming to an immediate determination he instantly ordered one hundred soldiers to be got in readiness which with an order to the inhabitants of Dowasah to deliver the dates were sent away in company of the Swallow, Captain Nesbill having orders not to suffer any dates whatever to be carried from Dowasah untill Mr. Shaw's demand was first satisfied. -i - cxxx. Translation of a letter from Ali Bashaw, to Andrew Trice, received tie 18th Octoier 1863. The Pasha asks for Tlie receipt of the two letters you wrote me not long since gave me the EngiiXshfps highest satisfaction, the contents of which I understood. In answer then to against the Kaab. the first—I see clearly from Mr. Shaw's pretensions on Dowasah that you are well acquainted with the hostilities Sheikh Sulaiman the Chaab has committed, and from the exact relation which I have received from my Mussaleem, by which it appears that Shaikh Sulaiman acts in every respect with the highest insolence. I think it fitting to bring him to reason. I am gratefully sensible of the assistance, you (on account of Mr. Shaw's pretensions afforded my sub jects in delivering Sheikh Ali, in consequence of which favour) the motive of which I am sensible, was the sincererety of your friendship for me. I have vested the said Sheikh Ali with a coat of honour. This affair has increased and stung the regard I had for you, may God preserve your health and continue cur friendship. You have by your manner^of acting confined the friendship that has ever subsisted between the Sultan and the British nation, on which account, I on my own part shall not miss any opportunity of convincing you of my hearty friendship, I hope however in consequence of the accounts sent me by my Mussaleem of Sheikh Sulaiman's hostilities, that you will continue to assist with your ships without any excuse, as it will not only be highly agreeable to me, but likewise to the Grand Signior, to whom I shall not fail to notice it. I had intentions before the arrival of Shaikh Ali to march towards Hovisa but have now (depending on the assistance of your ships) taken the road for Basrah, and my desire is, as the well being of my Government depends upon it, that while I march with my army by land, you will send your ships to block up the mouth of the river, and you have full power to take, burn and destroy whatever you may meet with beloiiging to the Chaab, in short make yourselves masters of the Gallivats, as they will no doubt endeavour to escape to sea, and this my letter shall be a sufficient warrant for anything that may happen. The demolishing the Chaab will be a gbry to your nation, and171 not to me, and you may be persuaded that this your ready assistance will be well known, and I doubt not recompensed by the Sultan, it remains now with you, as soon as my letter arrives to despatch away the ships, as besides the glory that will accrue, 'tis ever meritorious to demolish, those who molest the least of our friends. The success therefore of this affair, depends on your deligencej friendship and sincerity. CXXXI.

Aga Mahomet having very strenuously entreated me thereto assuring me that Sadoo Ohaun would be so highly pleased by an European gentleman being sent to compliment him, that he would grant anything we could in reason desire.

J. ^ privileges by Saduk agreement 1 had entered into with Shaikh Sadoon but as I found he was Karm^ha' wL a servant Sadoo Caun, the Governor of Shyrash, I directed Mr. Jervis to eondrsos them. apply to him for a confirmation thereof that the articles might be more full and extensive for which purpose I wrote him and he expressing a desire that an European might he sent him. Mr. Jervis not thinking proper to disoblige bim, despatched Mr. Dumford with the Linguist I have now the pleasure to .. ,. Ll ., m acquaint your Honour that Sadoo Caun t See Aitchison s Treaties (1892), Vol. X, 'U™ . , , , . , page 33. has given a new f grant by which our trade in the Kingdon of Persia is settled in a very advantageous manner. It is sent to Carem Caun for his confirmation which I do not the least doubt of. Nothing now remains to secure our trade on a solid footing but the reduction of Meet Mahanna, Governor of Bandareek, who having it in his power to stop the caravans coming from Shyrash or at least greatly to intimedate then. The Persians, some months ago, sent an army against him the Shaikh of Bushire being ordered to join them but as it's said he has private intelligence with Meer Mahanna who having also his port open the Persians have hitherto been able to do little of consequence. The Governor of Shyrash therefore wrote to me to desire we would assist him with our vessils from the Sea and at the same time sent one of his principal men to Mr. Jerrvis to settle the terms I having previously agreed with the Caun to give us Rs. 22,000 annually for maintain in a Guard Vessel at Bushire in case of your Honour, etc., should approve it. I am, etc., ANDREW PRICE.President and Governor and Council, Bombay, to William Andrew Peice and Dymogk Lyster. Gentlemen, ^ * We shall now proceed to reply to the several Letters received from the Orders on the Agent (M-l- Price) since his an ival at Bussora, and give you such orders and and Shawfaarden directions as appear to us necessary in consequence thereof. As he (M-i- Price) sh^^rdered^to ^ represents he committed no acts of Hostility and we'suppose no interruption S e 1 I ! r ^ ide ° c y', Hadji Yusuf held was given to the trade ot the Port, we approve of the measures he pursued on responsible for the his arrival (at Bussora), in^ not going to Town till some previous measures were &lt;iebts settled with the Government and though it affords us the utmost satisfaction to find it put out of dispute that Hadjee Eusuph is really indebted on account of Woollens the sum of Tomaunds 11,674-53-24 and that Mj, Price is possessed of his obligation for the same; yet we must still look upon Messrs. Shaw and Garden as responsible for the Balance of 3?omaunds 11,807-2-10 due to our Hon'ble Masters the 24th March 1762, nor does it in our opinion the least exculpate those Gentlemen for being guilty of a Breach of orders in delivering Woollens upon trust although it clears them from the suspicion which from the Cash account might have been entertained of their having appropriated that amount to their own use, and which has induced us unanimously to agree to take off the Bar to MjL Shaw's coming into Council, and to admit him to a Seat therein, conformable to his standing, submitting his conduct as to delivering Woollens upon trust contrary to orders, and the consequence which may ensue therefrom to the determination of the Hon'ble Company, to whom a full and impartial account of these transactions will be transmitted as soon as we receive the necessary particulars from Mr. Price. M^ Shaw must therefore hold him self in readiness for repairing to the Presidency accordingly whenever he may think proper, though as his presence at Bussorah may be essentially necessary for procuring payment of the above money from Hodjee Eusuph, by which alone there seems to be any prospect of his being enabled to discharge the above Balance due from him and MX Garden, we think it behoves him in such case to stay till it is cleared. Eor the same reason which has induced us to be s 0 favourable to M ~ Shaw, we have agreed to take off M jl Garden's suspension and restore him to the service, until our Hon'ble Master's pleasure can be known regarding him, and as M jl Price represents he may be serviceable in their affairs at Bussorah, we permit of his continuing to act in his station there, but we cannot think of confirming him as second, until his future behaviour shall induce us entirely to look over his past misconduct, and convince us he merits so great an indulgence.' ***** We really do not see the necessity there was for detaining the Swallow as Detention of W. Price writes he intended and as the frequent and almost constant detention in th0 of the cruizers at Bassori, is found to be attended with many inconveniences and is very prejudicial to the service of the Presidency, we find ourselves now under the disagreeable necessity of limiting the stay of all cruizers at Bassora to a month after their arrival at furthest which you are therefore strictly ordered to observe as a standing rule that we shall at the same time rely onm IT your returning them as mucli sooner as possible, but as by this means you may not be able alway to send returns by the cruizers we are now to renew the Soltitude form only given you of freighting on any good country ships which may offer to the amount of Rs. 50,000 which we are of opinion will be more for our Hon'ble Master's interest than detaining their vessels at a heavy expense and in a fruitless expectation of sending money by tbem. With respect to W. Price's proposal for having a Latty at your settlement in the same manner as they have at Surat, we in order to prevent as much as possible any deceit or imposition readily agree to your appointing a Latty Master by whose note all imports and exports must pass as practised both here and at Garat, but we cannot admit of the proprietors of goods being obliged to lodge their goods in any particular place, nor can we agree to building a Latty as Mjl Price proposes on account of the heavy expense to which it might subject our Hon'ble Masters and the objections succeeding Mussaleems might make to it, for although it may as MX Price represents be agreeable to the present one it may prove otherwise to them, should you however at any time have cause to suspect frauds in the established duties of the port, you are to take the most eligible means for prenting them for which purpose it will be proper to give the Latty Master a proper number of persons under him as assistant. Guard vessels for Mjl Jervis not having received any answer from Sadoo Caun as to the proposal made him M-i-Price we cannot now come to any resolution in res pect thereto, but even was it esteemed eligible to keep three guard vessels in the Gulf as Mjl Price mentions we could only agree to it; on the Oaun's con senting to defray the whole expense which would thereby be incurred, as it appears by a calculate thereof, it would amount to Es. 35,000, krans exclusive of the wear and tear of the vessels, and without allowing for the difference in the price of provisions here and in the Gulf, which would bring it consider ably beyond the sum Mjl Price mentions. In respect to the grant obtained from Sadoo Caun we by no means approve of your conveying into execution the sixth article, whereby all mer chants are expressly prohibited from purchasing goods but within the con sent and knowledge of the Chief for the time being as we postively direct that the trade be subject to no restrictions of this sort but that it be open to everyone. The first article desired by the Caun is in some measure unnecessary for , it should be found advantageous, merchants who may trade thither will undoubtedly bring away goods, but if otherwise they will certainly expect to be paid in specie for any goods they may carry there for sale. As to that article were he would limit us to sell to the principal mer chants of credit, it is natural to imagine we should give them the preference but at the same time we do not mean to be under any restrictions but to have a liberty to sell to whom we may think proper. We are, etc,, CHARLES CROMMELIN, and others. Bombay Castle; 84ih January 1764.175 cxxxv. Extract from despatch of the Court of Directors to the Bombay Government, dated the 8th November 1764, M-i- William Shaw having left Bussorah without any leave from his Ordering dismissal superiors at Bombay, and notwithstanding it appears he has been at Aleppo tl^fer oToarden for a considerable time past, he has not thought fit to write one line to inform to the Presi( iency. us of his motives for so doing, or indeed to give us any account of his proceed ings, we have thought proper to dismiss him from the Company's service. You are, therefore, in case of his being at Bussorah, to signify the same to him, and at the same time to acquaint him we require his return to England forth with, to answer for his conduct in general, which has been very unsatisfactory to the Court. As M- Robert Garden was joined with Mx Shaw in the man agement of the Company's affairs at Bussorah, we do not think it is proper he should continue there any longer, he is therefore to return to Bombay by the first proper conveyance that offers/' CXXXVI.

Bushire, L. from Dated the 27th August advised that since the departure of the Drake Ketch his sales had been very trifling and he found that not having in warehouse a proper sortment of Perpets was the principal cause of it. That there were two or three Corasoon merchants in town who wanted to purchase to a considerable amount, but on his informing him there were no scarlet perpets in wharehouse they acquainted him they had rather remain there until a supply came from hence and that they offered to take all the green and blue Perpets at 20 Rupees per piece provided he would sell them separately, but that being a measure disapproved by the Agent and Council at Bussorah he had declined the same. That a principal Oorazoon merchant of Yeidz who was last season down there had wrote he should be there again about December of January earnestly requesting he would apply to us for good sortment of Perpets, those being now in demand here. He therefore transmitted an indent for such articles he judged would be required there for the winter season and requested we would supply him also with some stationary and medicines. He acquainted us that Carem Caun had confirmed his Brothers Grants, and as he declared he would himself absolutely be down there against Meer Mahanna in November or December, he had earnestly requested we would assist him with a vessel or two to prevent the rebel from escaping him in gallivats by the sea and in consideration of such assistance declared he was willing to assign the Honble Company the annual sum of 40,000 Rupees for two Cruizers or 20,000 for one to be stationed in the Gulph for the protection of the Trade, and had also made an offer of delivering up to the Honble Company the Town and GovernmJ- of Bunderik if agreeable to us. That he was encamped amongst the Baptiaries between Spahaun and Bagdat and had an Army of near one ^ hundred thousand men—That in consequence of orders from the Agency he returned on the Tartar the detachment of military he had there an account of whose pay advanced at different times came endosed.

Sir, You will not take amiss by this present my giving You a detail of the Irregular Conduct &amp; of the violence Committed by the English Gentlemen at179 Bunder Abassy against our Factory under pretence of driving out the Persians who had retir'd there; You surely Sir are not ignorant that they did not fear breaking open the Doors with Hatchets, also the Windows as well as burning the platforms on which were formerly Cannon; in a word their Committing all manner of Hostilitys in the Factory, not ever sparing the Effects of the Inspector of said Factory J. Jacob Christanus &amp; by which means he was deprive of all he possess'd; &amp; the Factory renderM entirely Defenceless, and that to the Scandal of our Company. I came, therefore, Sir, by this present to protest to You a Chief of the English Company in the persian Gulph, and my representing the Dutch Company; against all those attempts and Violence committed by your Nation against the Goods &amp; Honor of our Company, and pretend to an entire indemnity for all the Wastes &amp; Loses our Company and the Inspector of the Factory have suffer'd on this occasion.

Copy of a paragraph of a letter from, the Agent in answer to the above dated the 8 th Sept* I observe, Sir, what You mention concerning the protest which you have sent me in consequence of the Information given in at Batavia by the Inspec tor Christanus, with respect to the Irregular proceedings of the English at Gombroon against the Dutch Factory, &amp; which you are pleased to request me to reply to separately, for all I can say to it is that as I am not acquainted with any transactions of this nature committed by the English Gentlemen there I cannot esteem myself a fitt person to answer thereto; except I had been on the Spot at that Time &amp; cou'd judge of the Circumstances, but as neither one or the other is the case consequently am no ways authoris'd to reply to such remonstrances without permission of my Superiors at Bombay, &amp; must there fore beg leave to return the protest, &amp; refer You to the Gentlemen there for Satisfaction as to the points complainM of therein.

Hon'ble H. gren7illb to Peter Elwin Wrench , EsqJL. at Bassora. S ir, Why and how a A few Days agoe Your Letter of the 20^. July came to my hands in- ™ obtdZTbyk forming me of your being appointed Agent for the E. I. Company's Affairs at forthe Ag?nt S a? aor Bassora on the departure of Mi. Price, &amp; of your having taken upon you Basrah, instruc- ^ ie e Xec utioa of that Charge, Consequently in all future concerns of the Com- pany at the porte (which have for some Months past been neither unim portant, nor few, &amp; which have more than sufficiently engag'd my Time, my thoughts, &amp; my Pen) I shall address my Dispatches to You; I shall make no recapitulation here of the several Steps, I have been pursuing at the porte in the Service of the Company's Affairs there; As my past dispatches to Lyster &amp; Mjl . Garden will have given you all fitt &amp; necessary Lights upon that Subject, &amp; more especially as I now transmitt You here with Duplicates o£ my last Lstters to Grarden of the &amp; 7^- August the better to Guard against the ill consequences of any Miscarriage upon the road, tho' certainly when I consider the Bearer of those Dispatches, nothing of that Sort is to be apprehended. Prom those Dispatches You will have learnt the difficulties I have had to encounter at the Porte, the Scenes of entanglements which I found myself engag'd in with the Vizier, 'ere I cou'd work out an accomplishment of the great object in view, &amp; obtain leave for dispatching away an Officer of Dis tinction from the porte, &amp; making him the Bearer of the Portes Commands to Bussora: at length however I succeeded; fortunately I have prov'd a Successful Negotiator at the Porte, &amp; much I hope that this Officer will prove as successful a Messenger of the Company's Service, and for all parties interested; which I shall wait with eager impatience to be inform'd of. Prom those Dispatches too, You will have learnt that I was still labouring to succeed at the Porte in that very difficult pinch of Business, so often spoken of allready in my former Dispatches, &amp; now at length happily obtain'd, I mean a Consulary Birat from the porte for the Company's Agents at Bassora ; It is a real satisfaction to me thus to have it in my power, in the first Letter I write, &amp; in the first opening of my Correspondence with You, to congratu late you on this Event; I have all along look'd upon a Consulary Birat from the Porte as an object of such an high &amp; concernment to the Company's Interests in the Ottoman Dominions at all times, &amp; particularly in the present Hour, amidst the present Distractions &amp; Irregularities of Government at Bussora, that I determin'd to leave no effort unemploy'd which cou'd possibly effect my Success : It is the Surest &amp; most efficacious means that he know of in this part of the World, for protecting the Company's Commerce their property, &amp; just rights; it secures to them for ever &amp; more firmly than any thing else can, a permament &amp; quiet residence at Bassora for their future Agents there, it silences for ever that new fangled but dangerous Doctrine at the Porte, the annual change of them. It is what has been ever practis'd by the Lerant Company in almost all the considerable Scales of the Lerant for the sake of their Commercial Affairs, and by these means it is that their Consuls seldom or never meet with Molestation in their respective Establish ments: The expediency &amp; advantage of such a Birat is manifest &amp; Clear;181 the attainment of it was the doubtful point, &amp; the more doubtful, not only because of the extreeme indisposition &amp; aversion in the porte to it, but because of its being in itself a new establishment never practis'd by us before at Bassora, &amp; an Innovation in the Eye of the porte. In spite however I have succeeded ; again I congratulate you upon it &amp; may the Company long enjoy the Fruits of my Success; This Birat together with the G : Signiors Com mandment attending it as likewis the Consulary patent or Commission from myself issued under the Loyal of the Embassy, &amp; all the necessary Trans- latins I have now the satisfaction of transmitting to You, under the Address, Direction &amp; Care of Mjl . Consul Kinlack at Aleppo, to whom I have parti- cularly recommended it, to find some safe, trusty, &amp; speedy means of con- veyance to You; The safe arrival of all I shall be glad to hear of in due time; &amp; shall depend upon You for giving me that Welcome IntelligeDce by the first Opportunity that offers afterwards. I think it necessary to inform You that the Consulary Birat &amp; all the Documents belonging to it run in the Name of Robert Garden; The notice of your actual arrival at Bassora, came to my knowledge to a late to admit of any alteration in the Birat, at that time but just issued at the porte; an alteration of that kind so immediate &amp; so sudden, the porte is not us'd to; &amp; indeed it is look'd upon here that such an alteration is not very necessary at all ; The porte attends not much to Christian Names; The Imperial Birat of Consul, once granted by the Grand Sultan is look'd npon by the porte as an Establishment of Consul for ever, not confin'd to one particular name, or one particular person, but com prehensive equally of the Successor, for form sake it is usual as often as the Consul is chang'd, &amp; the renewal costs but little at the Porte ; The present Birat therefore may be renewed in your own name, &amp; without Difficulty, some little Time hence; it is prudent to let 5 or 6 Months elapse first: for to Sollicit a renewal in any other Name New; almost in the Hour of its first Issuing, wou'd serve but to alarm the porte, &amp; revive their Jealousy's, wou'd occasion probably fresh difficultys, certainly fresh Expence : I shall therefore suspend my applications at the porte on this Subject for some time, or at least till such time as I hear from the Court of Directors upon this matter, or till I came to learn from yourself the necessity of a more early &amp; speedy application. In the mean time I have only to wish a safe &amp; speedy conveyance of this to Your Hands: I am the more anxious in my wish, because I look upon it that the peices from the porte are particularly necessary for the Companys Service in the present juncture &amp; amidst the present Widnesses which prevail at Bassora ; Where We learn the Mussaleem is upon the point of declaring him self in open rebellion against the Pacha ; no longer obeys his Orders; Seizes &amp; plunders without rendering any AcoJL toBagdat; remitts no part of the revenues; raises Troops, repairs Fortification &amp; seems to throw off the veil» without reserve. So disturb'd a Scene will I fear expose the Company's Affairs &amp; indeed all affairs at Bassora to the Danger of fresh Embroils: but I shall continue to give my best care &amp; Attention to whatever may still affect the Companys Affairs there, &amp; shall be ready to interp ose all my influence &amp; good offices at the porte for their Service, if unfortunately any further interposition of mine shall be found, necessary there. 2578 F. D.182 I am very Sensible Sir, to the obliging readiness you express of being usefull to me in the part of the World where you reside ; I desire to return You my thanks, &amp; to assure You of my being very truly.

We directed him to advise the Agent and [Council by every opportunity of all affairs under his management, and to send them copies of all letters to us, with all papers and Accounts that might accompany them.

R_L W. 0 Sir &amp; Sirs, This is purposely to advise your W_£- &amp;CL- that this Day arriv'd here from Congoon a Servant, a Helmsman and Lascars late belonging to Capii Sutherland of the Islamabad, who give the following relation. That the Islamabad having proceeded from this place down the Gulph, encountred near the Island of Kishme a very violent S : E : Wind, in which the Ship lost two anchors and was very near perishing that after this Capt£- Sutherland bore Karim Khan's proposals for stationiug one or two vessels in the Gulf.185 away before the wind up the Gulph again, as far as a place calFd Magoo, on the persian Shore, at which time the 6. Eebx. being distress'd for water an^ provisions, he sent his Long Boat on Shore at that place, for a Supply (these people that are now arriv'd here with the 3. Officer an Englishman and some others being in her) that having procur'd a supply of Water and provisions they return'd next Day for the Ship, and having after some difficulty reach'd her (the Wind then blowing very hard,) a rope was thrown to them by some of the Lascars and several of the people in the Long boat got into the Ship, but as the Captains Servant was getting in, some Arab Lascars (hired by CaptJL Sutherland and Bassara) wounded him in several places with a Lance on which he fell down into the Water and was taken into the Long Boat again shortly after this the same Arabs shott the .3 jL officer who was in the Long Boat with a pistol Ball thro' the Head, of which woun'd he instantly Died and» the other persons in the Boat cast her off and bore away to save their Lives 1 they add that during all the Time the Long Boat was along side the Ship they did not see either CaptjL or Officer on the Quarter Deck; That on the 7. PebX they went on shore at a little Town about a League to the S ' ward of Magoo&gt; where the Shaik stripped them and Seiz'd the Long Boat, this is all the relation they can give me from their own knowledge, but add that they were after wards inform'd, that the Arab Lascars had murder'd the Captain and Officers and plunder'd the Ship of money to a considerable amount and that Land ing with it on the Island of Khist, thft Shaik of that Island seiz'd them and took it from them, sending'them in a small Boat bound over to the Conti nent and this account is confirm'd by several persons arriv'd here from Congoon and other parts and whoaver that they had the relation from the very Arabs themselves, who perpetrated the Fact, giving in excuse for it, an account of their being cruelly treated by Captain Sutherland and his officers ^ &amp; it is added that after these Arabs had left the Ship, the remaining people on Board hired two Pilots at Khist &amp; proceeded with her for Muscat.

Enclos'd we transmitt copy of our Instructions to Mr Garden to which we beg leave to refer YJ Honor &amp;cJL of the points he is charg'd with who sett out on the 28 th &amp; shall only add on this, subject at present We have the greatest reason to hope he wdll meet with all desirable Success it being the Ultimate recourse we can take upon ourselves for obtaining Justice from them in the meantime shall embrace the first opportunity that offers to inform YJL Honor &amp;c_ very fully of all his proceedings. The Pasha's hesita- Your Honor &amp;GJL. will observe that the Bashaw seems very unwillin 0 * to wit^'theTmpemi com P 1 y Imperial Birat &amp; CommandnA that accompany'd it, alledging Birat. no such Consulage was demanded before by any of the Companys Servants residing here, which in fact is very true because no Commission of this kind was ever obtain'd before from the Embassador at the Porte but this we have reason to believe is neither the Real nor Sole motive for his dislike to it at present, being well assur'd the Merchants at first without considering the advantage that wou'd accrue to them from it sent him a considerable Present to prevent its taking place &amp; therefore he expects one from us to a greater am which will at once remove his present objections &amp; every obstacle that has been thrown in its way, whence we make no doubt but, M Garden will be able to effect the neces sary orders for carrying the same into execution when it appears to Us, that many &amp; great advantages will*arise to the Merchants &amp; Trade in general from it at this place for as they have a right in consequence thereof to demand our protec tion against the enormitys so frequently committed by the Shawbunders People while their Goods are laying at the Gumrook or Custom House they wou'd therefore all be Landed at our Lathy if they chose it &amp; clear'd out upon the Sale without any other Charge but the 2 P CX &amp; thus the Trade wou'd circulate more freely &amp; we shou'd answer to the GovernmX for their Duty of 7P C-l besides the Armenians in particular who are Chief Freighters from Bengal seeing tbeir property thus Secur'd wou'd never send their Goods on187 # any Bottoms but the English nor wou'd any other Merchants from India, an advantage very obvious to our Trade &amp; Interest in general and in general ^ which one &amp; all of them here wou'd be glad of provided we can establish it on this footing for which, however, we shall take no measures with the Governm but what they shall readily consent to flattering ourselves that in a short time more to advise Yi^ Honor &amp;c^ this affair has happily succeeded agreeable to our 'Wishes, otherwise the Company must sustain the Expense it has cost them at the Porte without any other apparent means of being reimsburs'd. We now dispatch the Tartar who return'd from Buahire the 7-^ Ins-i-, Assistance asked for it not being possible to unload. Ballast and fitt her for Sea any sooner as Your agahTs^Meof^ Honor, will observe by Copy of the Commanders letter to Us, in con- MohaIla • sequence of Mr. Jervis's request for her being dispatch'd with all haste in order to assist Carem Caunin his attack of Bunderick who had appl'd to him for this purpose by Letter as we have fully explain'd our sentiments on this Affairs in our reply to Mr. Jervis Copy of which with his letter to us are now forwarded to Y-L- Honor &amp;c^ . We shall only here add that We beg leave to refer you hereto, except that We have in Obedience to your Commands put the Commander under his orders leaving him to determine on employing her or not as Circumstances shall appear to him for or against it hoping our Conduct herein will meet with Your Honour, &amp;c^ approval. Lately the Agent communicated to Us the Contents of a letter receiv'd from the Baron D'renkelmen wherein he has desir'd his Protection to the Subject of his Imperial Majesty residing at Bussora in consequence of a Commission formerly sent hither appointing Mr. Lyster who then was in Sole Charge of the Companys' Affairs, Consul for His Imperial Majesty at Bussora translate of which goes in the Packets. But as the Agent thinks it incumbent on him to obtain Your Honor &amp;o-^. permission before he accepts of such powers from Foreign Nation he requests your directions on this Head by the first Opportunity. Having wrote thus for a Boat arriv'd express with a Letter from the The Islamabad Resdi^ at Bushire giving a detail of the unhappy Catastrophy on Board the catastr0 ^ e - Hamabad Capt-^- Sutherland who with his Officers are suppos'd to have been murder'd by same arabs taken in here on acc-^- of his being in want of Men for the particulars of which we beg leave to refer Your Honor &amp; to Copy of the Eesidents Letter now transmitted in the packet; This has occasion'd our coming to a determination of sending, Mr. Hallamby on Board the Tartar to Bushire, that in case the Resident there from his information of the Place where it is said these People concern'd in the Murder, landed with the Treasure &amp;cJ^ and plunder'd by the Shaik has reason to think there is any hopes of recovering the Money (fec-^ by the presence of the Tartar without endangering the Vessel or Companys property on Board, which we have directed him well to consider of as copy of our Letter now transmitted as by his situation he must be a more competent judge than Us that he will then give all needfull &amp; proper directions to the CommJL.. that Mr. Hallamby may proceed &amp; comply with the Instructions we have given him as &amp; Copy enclos'd, for this Service, but if on the Contrary it shou'd not be feasible that then Mr. Hallamby is to return hither by the first opportunity which procedure of ours we hope will meet with YJL Honor, &amp;c^ approbation as by the best Accounts we can get at present the Treasure the Vessell must have been plunder'd of amt4- t 0188 near four Lack of Rupees two of which is English Property the other that of Armenians ^ other Merchants. The Detachment of Seapoys helong-JL to this place &amp; Bushire have been reliev'dj but there are three less retarn'd from hence than were bro-L hither; one is Dead &amp; the other two stays here by choice serving as the Agents Ohubdars, We have been necessitated to land the Cloathing sent hither for the reliev'd Seapoys as it is much wanted when they go abroad with the .Agent on public Visits, &amp;GJL. that being too Dirty &amp; Shabby to appear in that they broJL on their backs &amp; as they wanted other Necessaries for themselves we advanc'd them two Months pay as we did the others some time agoe of which Y-^- Honor &amp;c-^- has before been ad vis'd. As the Business of this Settlement requires another assistant in the Office we request Y X- Honor &amp;c^_ will please to send one by the first Opportunity. On the 15th Inst A_ we had another Change in the Mussaleemship here in favour of Soliman Aga, who has been so little time as yet in the GovernmA. appointed Mussalim there is no judging whether this Revolution will be better or worse for the Town at Basrah. tho'he seems to be well calculated for that Charge &amp; is said to be a grea^. Favourite of the Bushaw's &amp; by his profession of Friendship to Us in particular we have reason to think he will prove a good Friend to our Affairs of which he has already shown Us some convincing Proofs having in consequence of the Agents request giving him the preference to the French Resid A- in regard to the first Visit to the Serai, &amp; gave orders to his Guards that if he attempted to come there till after the English had their Audience to stop him, so that this point of contest is at last determin'd in our Favor ; accordingly the Agent waited on him and was rece'd with the greatest Markes of Friendship &amp; Distinction when he frequently assur'd Us that nothing shou'd be wanted on his part to show his regard for our Nation on all occasions &amp;cJL. &amp;c .

Sir, Your Letters under date the 12 Feb y &amp; 3 rd March were rece'd here the following by return of the Tartar to which we shall now reply. With respect to the request you make for our returning the Tartar in Qaesti on of or( ier that you may employ her in assisting the Caun against Mur Manna, we Khan against Meer are to acquaint You that altho' the Gov r &amp; Council have given you alattitude for this purpose We observe their meaning is whenever it does not interfere with any more material Service of the Company, nor do we think the Tartar was intended for any such Occasion being in no proper State for it, as you will see by copy of Capt n Prices Letter to Us herewith sent you, however she is now dispatch'd, it not being possible to unlode her &amp; fitt her for the Sea sooner &amp; the Comm JL directed to follow your Orders, but we must not fail to notice to you that it is his Opinion unless the Tartar is finally dispatch'd to the Presidency by the 15 Apnl she will not be able to Secure her Passage to India before the Belief of detach ments at Basrah and Bushire. Saliman Aga \189 Monsoon, which if she fails in will Occasion no small disappointment to our Superiors, besides a detention of her near 4 Months longer, she having on Board a considerable Quantity of Treasure &amp;cJL of the Company &amp; also some Freight belongs to the Merch t8 &amp; that we are directed to dispatch her finally on her return from Bushire agreeable to their former Orders on this Head, It appears also to Us very extraordinary that you shou'd not send Us Copy of the Caun's Letter to you wherein he has apply'd for this assistance, &amp; we' cannot conceive why he did not write the Agent on this Occasion, which is always Customary, &amp; what we think you shou'd have apply'd to him for, besides fiom what We learn Meermanna it is probable may have purchas'd his Peacei as he did formerly, ere the Tartar gets down to Bushire but supposing it otherwise, it is badly possible the poor force of that Vessell only, even if Shaik Sadoon joins his fleet, can be sufficient for the attack of Bunderick or to Block up the Place, whereas our making a Feint only we apprehend will rather hurt our Credit than do us any good &amp; its probable (agreeable to our Sentiments formerly given you on this Head) may bring on very fatal Consequences to the Company &amp; our Trade hither,- for if he is not totally destroy'd which we are afraid will scarce ever be the case even with a greater Sea Force than you have to send against him at present it is likely he will be so incens'd with your thus declaring War with him, that it is probable as soon as the Cauns Army is withdrawn, which cannot make any long stay, he may make a Descent upon Bushire with a view of seizing on the Companys property, &amp; no doubt will attack every English Vessel bound up the Gulph; all which Circumstances we have esteem'd our duty to point out to You, as well as that we think the Caun seeing you under an absolute necessity of dispatching the Tartar immediately, in order to save her Passage to India will take it as a sufficient excuse for your not being able to comply with his requests ; But on the whole you are to determine for yourself, &amp; we. shall only further add on the Subject that we have therefore, &amp; in complyance with our Superiors Directions to you, but the Commander of the Tartar under your Orders as already mention'd. As you represent the Prankey is not fitt for any Service being in want of Bepairs &amp; that the Expence thereof wou'd am4- to more than she is worth we wou'd have you dispose of her at publick Puteny, &amp; acquaints Us what necessity you have for a small one &amp; what she wou'd Cost when we shall send you our determinations on this Head. There are two Seepoys of the new DetachmJL now on Board the Tartar which you are to receive on shore &amp; as you will then have your full Complem— as establish'd by the Presidency you are to discharge the two you hired in their Room.

Extracts from the Basrah Factory Diary No. m of 1764-65for 1—11 May, 1765. A Trankey belonging to Carrack being shortly to Sail resolv'd to sen'd a Letter by her to be lodg'd there purposely to give notice to all Shipping belong Measures taken ^ Ensrlish bound hither to beware of the Chaubs Gallivats who may in a against the Kaab 0 • • i j by the Turks and probability attack them on a supposition that we are going to assist against Sw^thK^a 6 ^'him also another Copy thereof be sent to Bushire with a Letter to the Khan, Resident. The Shreff Basbee came with orders from the Mussaleem to examine &amp; look at the Kapalamas as deposited by Hodjee Eusuph which were shown him &amp; after taking some Memorandums of their dates &amp;c |L went away. By a Chogueda arriv'd this day from Bagdat there is news that the Captain Bashaw is displaced, that post given again to Mastafa Bashaw. Yesterday the Mussaleem went to May gill to have an interview with the Montipih Shaik and did not return till 10 at Night, nothing as yet transpires concerning the Council they had together but its the Opinion of every Body their Meeting was held in consequence of Carem Cauns having sent his People here lately to demand the Chaub's money and effects which they learn was deposited with the Montipih Shaik. Several of Carem Caun's Eorces came in sight of Minac this Day to the no. of near 800 on the other side the Eiver, but are not come ovei: it as yet; the Captain Bashaws Gallivat are now fitted to go against the Chaub, but at the best they make a most miserable figure &amp; seem very little capable of action. It is well known the Chaub at present shelters himself at an Island below the Biver call'd Dwiack and every Body conjectures he will defend himself there till absolute necessity obliges him to fly, in which case it is said he has already secur'd an Asylum for himself &amp; his People where the Caun's Porces cannot follow him. During these Commotions little or no Business can be transacted in Town; No money to be had, &amp; those that have any are afraid to show it, the GovernmA- demands being very yery great at present to support their Charges so that there is an entire stagnation to all Trade. Came in another Cheguedah from Bagdat with a Letter from Mr. Garden and one from Mr. Lyster the former to advise his arriva there the 20th &amp; Agreement with the manner of his reception, with all to acquaint TJs of the request of the Garden and Lyster t -, , , • ^ j ^ , deputed to Baghdad Basnaw to assist mm against the Chaub with such English Vessells as may EVgVsh d Com- fymg at tllis port, that they were sending from Bagdat 5 or $00 Barratalys to manders of vessels join the Caurus Eorces, &amp; that the Bashaw had given full authority to the going to the Turks agahlt^he Mussaleem to treat with tile Agent on the proper measures to be pursued on this Kaab. captain Occasion also to indemnify the Commanders from any risk &amp; to allow them engaged? 1 6 Tesse a consideration for their trouble. Rece'd a Letter from the Kia to the above effect strenuously urging the Bashaw's request in respecUo our Vessells pro mising that the Commissions Mr. Garden was charged with would be finish'd with all speed not doubting to receive in the interim the good News of our wil lingness to oblige the Bashaw as he had desir'd. Immediately on receipt of the above sent the Linguists to the Mussaleem to acquaint him that I wou'd confer with him on these Affaris whenever he chose it &amp; that Capti Varkison's Vessel was ready to go on their service as soon as he pleased as before agreed on.IK; 191 11 Advice being just now broJL me that it is possible the Chaub may make some attemps in the Night time to burn the Tanny Snow knowing that if she is destroy'd he can manage the Captain Bashaws Gallivats as he pleases wrote a letter to Captain Parkinson to give him notice thereof &amp; in order that he might send directions on his People to be on their Guard. This afternoon Mulna Hossein waited on me again on the Subject of our assistance when Captain Parkison being present he desirM to know in what manner he wou'd have the Fanny valued and the Bisk secur'd to his owners, who reply'd that sKe cost him about 20,000 Ejl when the other proposing to pass an obligation to Captain Parkison in the Mussaleem's Name for that amount it was agreed to by him &amp; as to the consideration to be given him for his trouble he trusts to the Honor of the Mussaleem to allow him what is Customary except in case any Gallivats or Boats belonging to the Chaub shou'd be taken that then he demands Is. of the value exclusive of what he is to have for his trouble upon which CaptJL Parkison withdrew. Mulna Hosseiu then deliver'd a Letter much to the same purport as the Kia's &amp; took this occasion to assure me that the affair at Bagdat wou'd terminate greatly to my satisfaction. That the Mussaleem had about 3,000 Musquet Men ready to go against the Chaub as soon as the Barratalys expected from Bagdat arriv'd they were to March &amp; the Vessells to move down the River at the same time, and proceed afterwards as circumstances might admit with regard to the attack &amp; expressing that the Mussaleem was desirous of going on Board the Panny to see her &amp; that I wou'd accompany him he withdrew after being assur'd that I won't meet him &amp; that everything shou'd be conducted as he desir'd. There being a Cheguedar to set out in the Even^- for Bagdat wrote MJL Lyster in reply to M -i- Garden's letter as follows— Several of the people belonging to the Captain Bashaws Galleys went last Night to the Mussaleem to complain that they had neither Pay nor Provisions from the Captain Bashaw altho' Order'd upon the Expedition; this caus'd some enquiry to Day when the CaptJL Bashaw being at the Serai declar'd to the Mussaleem he wou'd hold his Post no longer upon which Mustafa Bashaw was appointed agreeable to the orders from Bagdat in his Stead and being vested with a Sable Courk at the Serai in the usual manner went immediately &amp; took on himself that Charge ; The Linguists being sent with the Agents Compliments of Congratulation on the above occasion were rece'd with great marks of Politeness and vested with two Caraceas. News is just now brought that the Com-!- Forces to the number of 5,000 Movements of had Cross'd the Eiver at a place call'd Meezza &amp; had got possession of a^rc^agalnsUhe ! Granary belonging to the Chaub. Kaab * There being a report that an English Vessell was came into this Eiver a Hamal was dispatch'd two Days ago with a Letter to the Commander but has return'd without leaving any account of her &amp; reports that the Chaub has 12 Gallivats on Board of which he has put his Women &amp; Effects now lying at the entrance which has entirely stopped the communication to Bassora &amp; that three of the Gallivats were employ'd in doing all the mischief they can to Shaik Dervis's country burning and destroying all the Villages near the River Side &amp; carrying off their women &amp;c^ Effects. To Day the Mussaleem with a considerable number of the Forces going on the Expedition came to the point at the Creeks Mouth and encamp'd there in lents &amp; afterwards reviewed the Barratalys arriv'd this Day from Bagdat; He was Saluted by the Captain Bashaw &amp; all the Galleys &amp;c a Teekna's in the Biver also by the Fanny Snow with 9 Guns. (192 Came to hand two Letters from M jl Garden the one a Duplicate of the 26. April &amp; the other an Original of the 30^ April chiefly to advise that the Kia was desirous of seeing the Kassalamas deposited by Hod : Eusuph to the AmX of 9,000 TomJL. &amp; to request that they might be sent him for this purpose as he was not of opinion with the late Mussaleem who deem'd them of no value. Just as the Mussaleem was embarking the Troops to proceed down the Sudden return of Eiver last night, arriv'd Letters from Oarem Caun expressing his dissatisfaction forces 1 to Persia. ^ Mussaleems being so tardy in Joining his Eorces for which reason he had determine to wait no longer &amp; had instantly March'd his army one Days Journey from the place where he was encamp'd. We rece'd the Mussaleems deputy dispatch'd sometime agoe with great unpoliteness not giving them any thing on their return. On the above advices the Mussaleem instantly assembled the Tons &amp;cX &amp; held a Council. It appear'd that the Expedition is put off, the Soldiers being all permitted to go to Town &amp; the Baratalys on Board the Eanny &amp; cjl Vessels were all disembark'd, the Mussaleem however keeps in Tents at the Mo'th of the Creek. This day wrote Mr. Lyster in reply to the Kia's request concerning the Eossalamas to acquaint him that if he wou'd empower the Mussaleem to take charge of them they shou'd be Granted him but that it was not consistent for Us to Send the Originals up to Bagdat they being liable to risk &amp;c CLI.

Hon'ble Sib- &amp; Sies, Our last respects to your Honi, under the 8th ult# was for warded by the Assistance Snow to Mr. Jervis in order to be transmitted by the Tartar. This Address goes by the Success CaptJL Grady, on which Ship M jl Garden now proceeds to the Presidency agreeable to the Hon'ble Company's Orders, having received his salary to the 1st July last with the usual allowance of Passage Money. In our address to the Hon'ble C-^ Copy whereof was forwarded to Your Hon'ble with our above respects. We have advised them very fully of the Conferences we had with the Government concerning the Bouratty Granted M^r- Garden for the sale of Hodjee Eusuph's Effects and of the Premisses then made Us of complying therewith Our Diary now transmitted shews the several proceedings we have taken concerning this Affair, both with the Mussalem and the Mombassy to this Time, wherein We have not failed to use our utmost endeavours to bring them to a compliance with the Bashaws Orders, but so many unforeseen Circumstances have occurred to prevent it which still subsists, as the Mussaleem assures us that nothing have as yet been done in it, though he makes Us very strong Premisses the whole shall be finished within a Twelve months hence, and that he has already given notice of the intended Sale but few or no purchasers are to be found, no body choosing to bid on Account the Demands of the Jamzaryes and other Creditors upon the Estate, the Mussaleem therefore proposed that the Hon'ble Comp^ Should purchase the Houses, Lands etc. and afterwards dispose of them at publick Sale believing that if this Method was taken none would be affraid to become Purchasers from the English. In Haji Yusufs Affairs.193 reply to the proposal he was told that We were ready to assist them with Selling off everything in the Company's Name, and would Send a Company's Servant to be Present at the Out Cry provided they would deliver to Us the Hogcotts but could not Accept the Houses &amp; in the manner the Mussaleem wanted, As to the Hogcotts they must be first delived to us otherwise ^we know very well it will be extremly difficult to find Purchasers, nor can we|Engage the HiL Companys' Name &amp; Credit in such an Affair without Seeing Strict Justice done, all which ^Ve represented to the iMussaleem &amp; have frequently ent to him for the Hugetts but somehow or other he always Evades Sending hem to Us alledging they are Old &amp; few or none remaining, &amp; that when we can get Purchasers he will Grant them a Certificate in the Grand Si r 5 Name which will he Sayes Answer the purpose better than the Hugcotts &amp;c where fore everything is at a stand again though We are constantly pressing Him, as also the Mombassy on the Subject, and shall continue to Exert ourselves all that is possible this way till such Time as we may receive Your Hon_i Directions concerning affairs in general, we shall pursue such a Conduct as may appear necessary in the Occasion consistent with your Orders. It is with much Concern We have to advise Your HonJL that on the 18th The Kaab seize the and 19th Ult ° r the Chaub with Six Gallivatts attacked the Sally &amp; took her &amp; wniLm! 1 Fort afterwards took the Hon'ble Companys' Yatck as they were both coming this Eiver from Bushere, after which they Saw the Eort William which Ship perceiv ing they had taken the Sally Stood back immediately, but the Pilott unfortu nately running a her ground on the Barr they pursued and took her likewise. On this unlucky Occasion We immediately applyed to the Mussaleem for his Assistance in getting them released, representing to him that as We traded here under bis Protection &amp; the Chaub was a Subject of the Grand Sigil we could not make any Application to the Chaub but through his means, when he assured Us he would do all that laid in his power to comply with our request, and directly dispatch d a Chokadar with a Letter to the Chaub accompanv'd by one from the Agent for this purpose, but tho' Several Letters have passed on this occasion he will not release them pretending that he has Demands on the Hon'ble Company, arising in the time of Messrs. Shaw &amp; Price as presented in his Letter now transmitted for the Meera on the Lands belonging to Maygell &amp; Dates taken from his Subjects. The agent having called upon Mr. Garden to reply to these allegations of the Chaub, enclosed Your Hon ^ &amp;c ^-will receive Copy thereof, whereby it appears they are entirely without foundation. We shall therefore continue our applications to this Government to obtain the Discharge of the Ships, but are apprehensive it will not be attended with any Sucess unless a Marine Eorce is sent to oblige the Chaub to deliver them up &amp;, is what the Government here has very pressingly desired We would apply to Your Hon-ji. for, declaring that they will March against him by Land if we will agree to Attack him by Water and prevent his escaping with his Gallivatts. Enclosed is a letter from he Massaleem to the Hon'ble the President on this Subject &amp; another expected from the Bashaw will be forwarded as soon as it arrives, wherein they propose that We shall receive a half of everything that is taken from the Chaub exclusive of the ships now in his Possession, which entirely belongs to Us ; And as it is not possible for them alone to do anything against him. We request Your Hon^. will send Us such a part of the Marine as You Judge will best answer this purpose, for unless we can bring him to some Terms it will Scarce be possible for any Merchant Ships to proceed up this Hiver and beg leave to recommend that it should consist of two at least of the194 Oaptial Cruizers, with the Eagle or any small Yessells that draws but little water also four or more Gallivatts, which last will be much wanted to pursue him up the creek but which however we submit to Your better Judgment. Release Of Captaia Since writing the foregoing We have the pleasure to acquaint Your HoiiaK/the HonJL that tbe Chaub has released Captains Phillips and Holland with all ships captured. their officers, but first insisted that the Agent Should send him a Treaty of Peace to be continued on the Old footing between the TT° C° , &amp; Him which was consented to, finding he would not discharge the Gentlemen on any other Terms &amp; Enclosed we forward copy thereof, but he will not deliver up the Ships until Said Treaty is approved of and returned by Your HonJL &amp;c and having acquainted the Government with all these proceedings, they approved of our Sending it to him, but desired we wouM look Said Paper as a Matter of Form only calculated on purpose to get our People out of his hands, saying that as there was no reliance to be had on his promises, that he wou'd soon gone'as aforetimes to render the Treaty of no validity; At the Sametime we are daily in expectation of seeing the Oruizirs said to be in the Gulph Mr. Jervis having in Consequence of Our Letter to him Concerning the Tartar, sent an Express immediately with a Letter to the Commodore or Comm^ in Chief directino- him to repair to Bussorah ; It is also intended by the Govi that they shall go against the Chaub as soon as our Eorce arrive, &amp; the Bashaw has sent letters to desire Own assistance in Joining them, which Tour HonJL &amp; will judge by our situa tion cannot refuse complying with &amp; if we did we must not expect any favour from them. And as destroying the Chanb is of the Utmost Consequences to the Trade of this place and what the Twrks cannot prossibly Effect without our assistance, we are of Opinion, such an Opportunity should not be lost when our Ships arrive, not doubting Your Honi. &amp; will approve our conduct therein for the reasonsal ready given, and as the Gov4 are very- pressing with us to Send for a Force, in case this report of our Cruizers shoud be contradicted We request Your Hon^ will comply there with as speedily as possible as mentioned in the foregoing.

Their —m to the £ i i i-n i x Maaghil estate. ot by the Chaub, and having called on me to account for the same which from my long residence here I could not but be acquainted with, the following is a true state of the case whereby I doubt not but every allegation of the Chaubs will be fully refuted and those gentlemen entirely exculpated.

The Letter from the Resident at Bushire bore date the 6th Ultimo and Bushireletter from was purposely to advise that on the 1st Meer Mahana had by Esclade made himself master of the Dutch Town and Eort at Carrack after heseiging it Expu 1 sion of the 13 Days. Tbat the Resident thereof with about 50 soldiers had arrived at^yMeer^ah^na^ Bushire the Day before and requested Mr. Jervis would supply them with what money and necessaries they might have occasion for which he had Bushire Residency thought proper to grant and should take the Resident and Factors bills for what money he might let them have. That the Dutch gentlemen had in formed him they had made a brave defence though appeared quite otherwise to him as they had in Europeans &amp;c. Natives near 200 Fighting Men and Meer Mahana at most not above 500 and without Cannon who about midnight on the 31st December escladed the Town walls and got possession of the Castions and the next morning though there were above 60 or 70 Europeans in the Eort they delivered it up on condition of retiring in safety to what place they chose not having had above 8 or 9 Men killed, and wounded, that during the above transactions they were two Company ships lying in the road who immediately sailed down the Gulph when they saw the flag of truce hoisted in the fort but the Dutch Resident had dispatched a boat after them with Orders for one of them to return to take away himself and people either to Gombroon or Cochin. That it was thought Meer Mahana would soon after make an attempt on either Bushire or Barein and had spread a report that our Hon'ble Masters and other English property should be safe, though Mr. Jervis observed litte dependance could be had on the faith of a man who had murdered Father, Mother, Brother and about twenty other relations. He said that from the best accounts he was informed the two Bomb Vessels might take Carrack Town and Eort and that Meer Mahana being destroyed would be very advantngeous to trade and that the Capture would be consider able as tho. the Dutch had to empty ships in the Road they did not take the precautions to ship their goods off.

That the Tartar Snoio was now dispatched to them with 161 bales of cloth and 200 of long ells for their market which being landed they were to dispatch her to Bussorah unless they should judge her detention absolutely necessary for the security of our Hon'ble Masters property. That as the Hon'ble Company had been found very full in their Commands of the 22nd ot March last respecting the Goods of their Market, copy of which had been sent per Bombay grab. We directed them to pay due attention thereto and enable us as soon as possible to reply to such parts of them as required it, and sent them also copy of some later Orders for their Notice. CLVI.

She being a proper Vessel to go into the River of Dourack, The Wolf Gallivat was also sent to join them agreeable to the request of Captain Nesbitt. Your Honours have been advis'd that agreable to the Mussaleem's Request, Negotiations with 'We directed Mr. Jervis to apply to the shaik of Bushire for sending his Fleet Karim Khan for i • i assistance a^ainsti and Forces to join Us, &amp; to talk with the Shaik fully on this subject, but on no the Ka &amp; b. A ccount to make any promises or engagements in regard to Our assisting them against Meermanna, being possitively Ordered by Our Superiors to preserve an Amicable understanding with him, unless by his Conduct he had given any Just Cause to violate that Friendship, but in all Instances We canassure Your Honours he has shown Us the greatest Proofs of his Kespect &amp; regard for the English having behav'd in a most Friendly Manner towards the Gentlemen of the Berkshire and Four Friends, who call'dinat Carrack to furnish themselves with proper Pilots to Conduct them into Bussora River, as Your Honours will please to observe by Copy of a letter from Captain Justice herewith forwarded, in Answer to a Complaint made by the Shaik of Bushire against them on this Occasion, therefore the Shaik's Proposals with regard to Our Fleet can no ways be Comply'd with nor wou'd it be consistent at all to draw the Fleet from their present station to join the Persians, as in that Case the Chaub would immediately Embrace the Opportunity of getting out with his Galivats &amp; sending away his most valuable. Effects &amp;c., besides according to the Opin on of the Gentlemen above mentioned Meermanna has made such additions to the Fortifications of200 Carrack, &amp; preparations for his defence, having upwards of 3,000 Men which they declare they saw when he Muster'd his Forces in their presence, many of which are Good Horsemen, well Train'd all in Coats of Mail, tha we Apprehend Our Eorce at present would be hardly sufficient to dissposses him of that Place, even had We orders to proceed against him.

We are further to Acquaint Your Honours that during these transactions We have reed two letters from the Chaubs Translate of which with Our Answers sent him Accompanys this Address to which we beg leave to refer Your Honours more particularly for the Proposals he has made of coming to an Accomodation, but although we have given him an opening acquainut'd him 0 f the Terms were quire from him, we apprehend that they will all End in Nothing, as he has proposed no Security as Yet, and Experience has Sufficiently taught us that no manner of Confidence can be put in his ^Vords or Promises but should it contrary to Our Expectations, appear by his next Letter that he means Sincerely to treat with Us, &amp; not Amuse Us with meer pretences, in order to gain time, We shall not lett slip an Object of So great Importance, provided We can Settle a Peace on the above Forms, &amp; by Your Interception We may have reason to flatter ourselves of bringing the Turks and him likewise to an Accomodation, otherwise it would be to little purpose our Continuing at Bussora tho' in Peace with the Chaub, while it is Somuch in his Power to interrupt the Commerce of the Place, and on the One hand his demands would be so Extravagant that the Turks could not possibly comply with them &amp; on the other, they are so determined to reduce him ; having reed the grand Signor positive Orders on this head, that between both we can Entertain very little hopes of a Mediation taking place. This being the present critical situation of Affairs the Warm Weather now at hand and Our People falling Sick, the V essels in want of Repairs, renders it absolutely necessary to effect as soon as possible what can be done by the end of next Month. We have therefore declar'd to the Basharo and Mussaleem that if they want to keep the Fleet any longer than the 1st July, we shall consider the Warr against the Chaub entirely their Own, and that they must pay all Expences, which if they'r willing to Comply with, the Fleet must of Course be kept for the Security of this place otherwise We must come to a Resolution of withdraing the Consequence of hich would bo the Turks could never remain Masters of ihis place any longer;201 the Arabs would Govern it, and the Turks % to Bagdat; In Short the Confusions &amp; Troubles both In the Town &amp; Country wou'd be so great that no Trade cou'd be carried on &amp; this place wou'd be reduced to a meer fishing Town for the Mussaleem has already declar'd that if the English should now desert him he has no further Business at Bussora. On the Other hand, if the Turks will pay Our Expenoes Debts &amp;c. during the Detention of the Fleet, it is likely the Chaub may be reduced in the End concerning all which We shall come to the necessary resolutions as soon as the Bashaw's Answer is receiyed in reply to the letter wrote him as mention'd in our last Respects.

Nesbitt with an European Gunner four others only being pounded. The Commanders having represented it was impracti cable for them to carry on any further attempts without the assistance of coolys, it was resolved to write the Mussaleem thereon &amp; after Several Applications a few Men were Sent as requested at which time the Mussaleem being pressed for putting his Men into motion he return'd for Answer that as he had certain advices of Mabmoud Kia being on his way with a body of Troops requested all operations might cease till his Arrival at which time also the Agent reced.

Bashaw to repair with his Gallies to Gaban wherein Company with the Wolf Gallivat particularly requested for this service by Mahmoud Kia he accordingly arrived Safe, the Chaub People immediately on their appearance having deserted the Fort with the greatest precipitation the Conse quence of which has been a whole Tribe of the Chaubs principal Musquetiers having Fledd to Mahmoud Kia with their Families for protection as well as to our Ships; By these people we have learnt that the greatest disaffection reigns among his Troops who wou'd all desert him but that he keeps their chiefs continually within his Sight &amp; on the least Suspicion committs the most horrid Barbarities ; in Short they Say there is nothing wanting but for the Turks to march into his Country when it is thought the whole of his people wou'd immediately desert him therefore this Measure has been lately very Strongly represented by the Agent to the New Mussaileem who wrote word he wou'd March in a few days more only waiting for Some Horse he expected from the Montefeck Shaik &amp; as it has further been resolved the Agent shou'd repair to the Fleet to further affairs He was actually in Readiness to have gone by the Tartar who was dispatched here to take in Provisions, but that the Mussaleem having Letters arrived &amp; intimating as above that he cou'd not March in less than ten or twelve days together with the Agent being much indispos'd on which She was sent to the Fleet with the necessary Provisions &amp; directions to Captn.

Cause with the greatest vigours and alacrity ■ We cannot however help express your Concern that has not been in our power to conclude affairs sooner and return the Fleet to the Presidency, but doubt not when it is consider'd they are now in the pay of the Turks at 1000 Toms : &amp; Promising strict compliance with Court's orders (No. CLVI1), Policy of the late Resident unwise.mo. ch. more than, suffices for their real Expense this measure will be approv'd at Bombay, &amp; that it was always the Opinion of our Officers in. both the Marine and Military Department, that our Porce was not sufficient to Spare any Men for the Land Service, is well known, as well as that the Chaub by a most artfull Alacrity no sooner found himself Capable to resist the Fleet but immediately after the Engagement with his Gallivats went off to Damrach, where by the situation of the place it was impossible for Our Vessells to come at him, which together with the tardiness of the Turks, their waiting for Eeinforemt from Bagdat, &amp;c., shews the real Causes of the Service being so long protracted ; to which we beg leave to remark that had the Fleet been withdrawn and sent to India without effectually reducing this Eebel Shaikh, his sea power was such as he T^ou'd very shortly afterwards have been again Master of all the Country even to the Walls of Bussora, which wou'd in all likelyhood have ended in a Eevolution of Government with the entire extripation of the Turks who wou'd for their own security have Cutt off all Communication from Bagdat to Bussora at least till they cou'd Collect and prepare a sufficient Force to Cope with the Arabs &amp; then this Town and Country must have been involv'd in the greatest Confusion, all Trade at a stand, and both publick &amp; private property expos'd to him; On the other hand even had We at first found the Chaub of flexible Disposition Omitting to enter upon a Treaty of peace with tUe English, there was little or no probability of the success of Our Mediations to have established one between the lurks &amp; him, as the Grand Signiors Orde were arriv'd to take his head &amp; he had actually made the necessary prepara tions, to enable the Bashaw to carry on the War with Vigour, relying on the National Faith &amp; honor of the English that they wou'd not refuse their assis tance after their having apply'd to Bombay for it, &amp; for Us to have set down at Bassora in this situation with a separate peace with the Chaub, We dare say Your Honors will judge wou'd have been to little or no purpose, but that we must of'course have been forc'd to withdrawn, &amp; given up all Our Dems. to the Turks, who it is reasonable to Suppose wou'd in this case never have paid us a Fluce ? of Ho'd : Eusuup's Debt or any others, at least it wou'd have been very difficult if even we cou'd have recover'd them, &amp; by the arrival of the Bengal Ships soon after we had at State a most considerable Con cern in private property besides that of the publick, as well as an immediate profit accruing to Your Honors by a great encreaseof the Consulage Having ta¥en the licerty to explain in some measure the Motives for Our Conduct with respect to the detention of the Fleet we are in hopes the same will meet Your Honors approval as we have allways most Earnestly attended to every thing that Concern'd Your Interest, &amp; with the greatest assiduity us'd our utmost endeavours to bring this long depending Affairs to as speedy a Conclusion as speedy a Conclusion as possible, which we doubt not from all present appear- will be entirely sav'd ances fromed structionby the English is likely to turn out one of the most flourishing Marts for Trade in all India, Your Credit &amp; Interest much more Considerable than ever it was before. ******* May it please our Honours, &amp;c., &amp;c. PETER EDWIN WRENCH GEO, SKIIP. B assora, 24th August 1766.206 CLXIL Agent and Council, Basrah, to the President &amp; Govr., &amp; Council at Bombay. Hon'ble, Sir and Sies Deeming it of the utmost importance for Your Honor' &amp;c., to be acquainted of the present critical Situation of Affairs under our direction, We have come to a resolution of directing the Bushire packet Boat to proceed to Muscat with our present address, as also the Copy of the H. Court of Directors their Commands ^ece'd under the 21st August, the Original of which has been duely forwarded Your Honor' &amp;c., byway of Muscat &amp; for the mare expeditions &amp; secure method we have likewise employ'd Lieut. John Hall to proceed here with as also to procure another Boat at Muscat (returning this back to Bushire Residency) to convey him to the Presidency with said packet &amp;; we doubt not but he will fully answer our expectations to Your Honor &amp;c., satisfaction. We had intentions agreeable to what We wrote You last of sending one of the Schoon ers with the packet but considering, the risk she wou'd run of, meeting with fciie Sangarians or other Sea rovers by herself, &amp; the great want of them here, being so convenient for the Chaub's rivers we have come to a resolution to Detain them with the rest of the Fleet till we can know the final determinations of the Turks in regard to Carem Caun, for altho' they have mov'd their Camp from Jalahai to the Halfar on Acct phirmd lately sent them by the Caun of which particular notice is taken in the Sequel of this Address, yet there is reason to think they must renew the War again soon against the Chaub &amp; therefore have requested that we wou'd continue the Fleet on the present Station &amp; mantain Blockade by Sea as much as possible. Your Honor &amp;c., were advis'd under the 19 Augt that Mr. Lyster was directed to go to Mahomet Kia in order to obtain Paymt : or Security for the Sum Stipulated Monthly for the Charges of Our Flee^, which notwith- Delay rn payment standing, the Strongest Sollicitations and representation he made, Mahomet Kia by the Turks. pleaded his inability, especially as the Coffee Boats were not then arriv'd, but on Mr. Lyster's return it having been deem'd necessary that the Agent should acquaint him by Letter we cou'd nor wou'd not keep the Fleet unless that methods for our indemnification &amp; Security on that Head were properly made, it was further agreed that it was expedient to give the Commanders the necessary Orders for their Conduct on this occasion, which to apply for the above l n the most strenuous manner, &amp; in case they found he either had not ^previous to such application or immediatly thereon comply'd therewith they were to acquaint him they had rece'd rece'd positive Orders from Us repair on Board the Fleet which they were accordingly directed to do, &amp; the Commds of the vessells to make all the necessary Dispositions for Sailing but not to quit their Station or Endeavours to distress the Enemy by Sea, which we doubted not wou'd bring them to a due Observance of their Agreement, which if contrary to Our hopes shou'd prove otherwise they were to advise thereof by the Gallivat, which said Letters &amp; the directions are inclos'd for Your Honor (fe's inspection, but previous to said Orders having arriv'd with the Commrsa letter was receiv'd by the Agent from Mahomet Kia declaring that he had no inten- fcion of refusing paym't of the Expences of our Fleet but that on Acct the great want of Money for the Army &amp; Our People together, it was not in his power to comply with the Demand Mr. Lyster had Sollicited for, but in Order to Content Us he was willing to make a Transfer to the Agent of certain Revenues on the Dates call'd Timaur which we accepted on Condition that the same shou 'd be207 estimated at whatever the real produce might turn oat, So one Mahomet Siad having Agreed for the purchase thereof for the Sum of Toms ; 10S0. Mahomet Kia was wrote thereon requiring, him to pass a Jesseara for the same with a provisso that in case the produce thereof shou'd not make good the same to the purchaser the difference shou'd be paid by the Government &amp; that he mus t likewise send Us a Draught for the Ballance of the two Months being 820 Toms to be immediately clear'd which last sum has been rece'd into the Hon'ble Company's Cash &amp; the other, is now daily coming in. Previous to the forego ing which was on the 30 Augt : we rece'd advice from Captain Andrew Nesbitt that Shaik Gannum the Chaub'sson made an appointmt, tomeet him on the 23rd within a mile of the Chaub's lower Fort where the Fort William &amp; Sally then lay, whither he accordingly repair'd but that instead of coming to The English attack any moderate Terms he Annum behav'd with great Impertinence &amp; by what ^ iosaJ oa bo th he cou'd perceive intended to have him Massacred him and ^ P e op le which The Sally and Fort he prevented by attacking him first, in which Affair Gannum was dangerously William burnt, wounded several Shaks &amp; others kill'd &amp; Wounded with onl^ the loss of one European &amp; one Seepoy kill'd, 5 Europeans &amp; 3 Indians wounded, afterwards about 10 oclock (this affair happening about 5 in the Evening) the Flood having made he says he endeavour'd to Board the Fort William &amp; Sally but that being corns within about Musquet Shott the Knemy sett them both on Fire, but they continued there till the Flames burnt down to the Waters edge ; in reply thereto under the 6 Sept we wrote that we cou'd not but with some surprise observe that Oaptn Nesbitt should agree to hold a Meeting with Shaik Gannum on shore so far beyond the reach of our vessells or that he should take on himself to Treat with him or a peace without our knowledge or leave, as on referring to the several Letters he had Acted directly in Contradiction to Our possitive Orders which were to refer the Chaub entirely to the Agent &amp; Cn when ever he signify'd any intention?* of coming to a peace, giving immediate Advice thereof to Us &amp; assuring his people they shou'd be Treated with all imagin able Honor &amp; safety to their persons ; but on Acct the Bravery the Common men had shown in the Affair we had comply'd with bis request of distributing the plate he had sent up taken as plunder, as he represented it wou'd amt: to but a trifle, but that the same shou'd be publickly disposed of for their Benefit on the Quarter Dock which said Letter are for Your Honor &amp;Cn better information herein enclos'd. Under the 9th following we rec'd Advice from Captn Nesbitt that he left the Turkish Camp then at Gaban under the 30 Augt having his Charge the Turkish Galleys &amp;c., belonging to the Army &amp; that letters were dispatch'd Overland to Mahomet Kia to March to the lower Fort where the Ships laid formerly, advising Captn Brewer with his People were also disem- bark'd &amp; proceeding up the Biver with the Artillery Ammunition &amp;c a party of Seamen with them under the Commend of Lieut Hall &amp; Smith Under the 11th following letters were also rece'd from Captn' Brewer and Mahomet Kia by the former of which we were led to think Affairs were drawing near a Conclusion &amp; as the latter wrate very pressingly for the Agent to meet him it was agreed he should proceed on the Fortor then here which accordingly he did and arrived the 23rd at Barrack stand where our Fleet lay and from whence he sent the necessary Orders to the Commrsthen in Camp, whither it was then his intentions to proceed but was prevented by Messengers arriving from Camp the next day Morn'g with the Acct: of a most unfortunate attack made on the Enemys Redoubts wherein it is with the greatest Concern we are to acquaint Your Honor ^ Engligb &amp; Cn of Our having lost Captn Brewer Lieutent Kass and. Daly Serjeant Grant disaster.208 with 18 killed upon the Spot &amp; 32 dangeroulsy wounded, also our Feild Peice with 13 Chests of ammunition taken, and the same letters also mention'd that it would be with immediate danger for the Agent to come to Gamp, all the way up theEiver being laid with the Enemy, and that our Gallivat and Schoners had been frequently attack'd but the Enemy were always beat off with considerable loss on their side, in consequence of which the Agent after taking the whole into Consideration deemed it prudent to direct the remainder of Our People to be Embark'd, leaving only Six Gunners to assist the Turks in throwing shells advising Mahomet Kia accordingly by Letter, &amp; as the purpose of his repairing to the Meet was prevented by the above unfortunate Affairs &amp; his presence of no particular Service t here he determin'd on repair ing back to the Agency, after having issued the necessary Orders &amp; direc tions for the Commrs : future guidance, all which papers mention'd in this paragraph are enclos'd for Your Honor &amp; Cn perusal. During the Agents being on his passage to the Pleet Advices were rece'd burnt lb ^the K ^ Cliaub having attack'd the Turkish Galleys burnt several &amp; kill'd a urn y t e Kaab. niim be r 0 f their Men all which was Confirm'd by a letter from Captn. Brewer bearing date the 18th &amp; rece'd the 27th follow'g, wherein he setts forth that nine were burnt out of twelve one of which was the Admiral Galley, that by this Accident they had lost all their powder &amp; most of their Ammunition, &amp; this entirely owing to their neglect in not sending out the necessary Scouts, that for several Nights after the Enemy attack'd the Eemainder of.the Galleys but Our Schooners had beat them off with great loss on their Sides, &amp; the Night preceding they had attack'd the Schooners with upwards of 1,000 Men but were repuls'd, and the Turks then pursuing his former Advice detach'd a large Party of Horse &amp; Foot &amp; drove the Enemy into their Fort making great Slaughter, taking some prisoners; He likewise advis'd of one of the Trankeys bdongmg to the ±leet on her return thereto being Burnt by the Enemy entirely Trankeysof the ow i n § to the negligence of two Naiques &amp; 20 Seapays on Board of her being 1 (BngMP, fleet asleep but that only one was taken the others making their escape to the Schooners, this One the Ohanb return'd to Camp next Morning, with his Eight hand. Nose, &amp; Ears Cntt lott which kind of Cruelty had been mutually practis'd between the Chaub &amp; Turks all along, but to prevent the like in future he had requested Mahomet Kia to Treat prisoners with more Lenity • That he had also in Company with Lieut. : Day waited upon the Mussaleem &amp; pro- Pos _ ^ P lan for Storming the Enemy's Redoubts, which he Approv'd of &amp; promis'd assistance, but that upon the Entrance of Shaik Dorris one of the prin- cipal Sons, everything was disconcerted &amp; he had reason to believe the Chaub had intelligence thereof that Night from the same Quarter, He men- ion'd the Mussaleem requested he wou'd stay three Days before he made any further advances, as he was then in expectations of a reinforcement from the ersians, he writes also that he himself was preparing Timber for Scaling Ladders &amp; that if the Turks wou'd not give him any assistance he wou'd Storm the Place himself, that the Agent had better not think of coming to Camp as it was very dangerous, he also represented Our Doctor being so dangerously ill so as not to be capable of being of any Service to the Sick or wounded &amp; therefore requested a Capable person of the Faculty might be sent, in consequence of which the Factors apply'd to the French Chief for permission to emplov his the Service whioh hehayin S consented to on the Condition of being allowed d Frs &amp; Diem his Diet as also that of a Servant or Linguist with his209 'Wages which the necessity of the Service requiring they were oblig'd to Comply with. Likewise during the Agent's absence Mahomet Kia sent the Jescara on the Simaur in the manner requir'd as also a note on the Govt Customs for the Ballance being as before specified the sum of 320 Toms which was accordingly rece'd &amp; paid into the Treasury as above remark'd. Under the 5 Inst: the Agent rece'd a letter from the Bashaw confirming his former Agreement in regard to making good our Demands in General as also the paymt: of the Charges of our Fleet, for the latter of which he enclos'd a Bauratty which was immediately presented to the Govt here as usual on such Occasions for their perusal. On the 7 Inst : Letters were rece'd from Lieut. Magent acknowledging, receipt of the Agent's Commands &amp; acquainting that Mahomet Kia had requested he won'd stav a few Davs, when thev wou'd remove all together, The Tnrk3 trea k 1 ~ ' 0 up their Camp. giving an Acct likewise of some Persians having arriv'd in Camp with letters one of which being deliver'd to him he had carried it to the Mussaleem who promis'd to send it to the Agent ; Also the same Day the Agent rece'd a letter from Mahomet Aga wherein he advis'd of an Embassador having arriv'd from Carem Caun with a Phirm'd requiring the Turks and Us to quit his Country &amp; not make any further attempts on the Chaub, as te was his Subject &amp; whom he had taken under his protection, that therefore he Mahomet Aga for fear of Creating a War between the Persians &amp; them shou'd be oblig'd to comply ; In consequence of which upon mature deliberation we Agreed the Turks shou'd be made acquainted that We had nothing to do with the Persians nor shou'd we be refer'd to them for redress of our Grievances &amp; Losses that it was by their Instance we came here &amp; on their Acct: had been sufferers that by their own Agreements they were answerable to Us &amp; from them we shou'd expect its deeming it likewise necessary the same shou'd be Communicated by one of our Board, Mr. Skipp was appointed for the Service, whose Instruction on the Occasion we now likewise enclose for Your Honor &amp;Cn Inspection. In consequence of the above Resolutions Mr. Skipp proceeded in the Tartar the 10th on which Day we rece'd Advices from Captn Nesbitt that the Mussaleem had actually remov'd his Camp from before the Chaub's Porfc, &amp; on the 13 Letters Confirming the same were rece'd from Mahomet Kia, the I4th the Tartar return'd hither as Mr. Skipp had rece'd intelligence of the above &amp; gone thro' the Halfar in order to meet Mahomet Kia at Gaban, the same Day a Letter was rece'd from Captn. Nesbitt advising that all our Military, Artillery, &amp; Seapoys, with their Stores &amp;c., were Embark'd on Board the Grab, that also a Boat with a person, belonging to Mahomet Kia pass'd the Elect in its way to Bushire from whence he was to proceed with Letters to Carem Caun. On the 13th directions were sent to Captn. Nesbitt not to move his Station till further Orders ; Mr. Skipp return'd the 16bring'g a letter for the Agent from Mahom &gt; Kia &amp; Carem Caun's Phirmaund. On the 17. Mr. Skipp making his report in Council that the reason Mahomet KATim KhaI1 ' s | Kia gave for breaking up his Camp were that Chappars having arriv'd from claims the Kaab Carem Caun &amp; insisting in his behalf that he wou'd immediately retire fromandwishe^Se^ 3 out of the Persia Dominions, as the Chaub was their subject &amp; the Caun had He'andertakes'to appointed him Governor of Darrack, but that they declar'd notwithstanding } ftepafation^the they wou'd oblige him to make full reparation for all the Damages which he had English &amp; Turks. Committed on the English &amp; Turks, but insisted on his removing, that after them came also a Caun &amp; deliver'd a letter for our Chief declaring the same as the Chappars had before, that in consequence thereof he had Call'd a Council210 ht the Sons &amp;o., wherein it was unanimously Agreed to remove till suoh time as they cou'd receive further Orders from Bagdat &amp; Answers from Carem Caun Mr. Skipp also reported that Mahomet Kia particularly requested the Eleet might continue on their present Station, &amp; he wou'd agreeable to the Orders he had rece'd from the Bashaw pay the full Expences thereof an Acct: of which he requested might be given him &amp; further desir'd Mr. Skipp to assure the Agent he wou'd on no acct: break his promises in regard to Our Affairs which he had given at the Conference with him on his coming down from Bagdat ; that his not having sent the Caun's Letter hitherto was owing to the fear of its miscarrying but had himself open'd it ; He also desir'd the Agent might be inform'd that in a few Days he shou'd remo ve 1 is Camp to the Mouth of the Halfar, where he entreated the Agent wou'd favor him with an interview when he wou'd settle every point with him so as to give full satisfaction. On the 19th we met to take the above report into consideration &amp; having maturely Consider'd the extraordinary Conduct of Carem Caun &amp; the The^Bntish claims Turks, together with the present complicated &amp; unsettled State of Affairs; payment of Eesolv'd that as Mr. Skipps indisposition prevented h is return Mr. Hallamby fleet and Haji 6 shou'd be directed to go to Mahomet. Kia to expostulate with him on' this Ynsuf'sdebts. occasion &amp; to insist on his Complying with Our Pen d. agreeable to the Instructions before given Mr. Skipp ; 1 hat as he declares be understands the Bashaws Orders are to pay Us the real E xpences of the Pleet, he acquaints him we find it turns out on a Medium about 1,000 Toms. &amp; Md. according to the advances allready made &amp; that if necessary they shall see the A ccts. of the whole on the departure of the Eleet, as soon as they can be clos'd &amp; if it amtsitoless than that Sum they shall be allow'd the difference, provided they engage to pay TJs whatever it may exceed, &amp; that he be requir'd to declare whether he will continue this Allowance to the Eleet in case we still detain it sometime longer, in what manner &amp; when he proposes making the same good, also to insist on the Ballance now due on this Acct: be immediately made good as likewise to declare that the Value of the Vessells taken by the Chaub is to be made good to Us by the Turks not the Persians &amp; that they must apply for the same agreeable to the Contents of the Phrimaund ; That Had. Eusuphs Debt be put into a Course of paymt: agreeable to the plan he brot; down from Bagdat, &amp; Mahomet Kia is to be acquainted as it is owing to Our leet they are now in possession of the Produce of the Dates, &amp;c., of the Country which otherwise wou'd have beenreap'd by ^he Enemy, that We demand that the whole Amt: they have or shall receive be paid Us in order to satisfy our Demands in general, &amp; a Categorical Answer is to be requir'd to all Our above Demands &amp; Proposals, for as all necessary Orders &amp; Commands have been rece'd from the Bashaw for paying Us in General, it is unnecessary &amp; and only loosing of time to apply to Bagdat any more but except the same being put into Execution without any further references or delays or we shall regulate Council accordingly. Mr. Hallamby is also to declare on our Behalf that it is our firm resolves to quit Ihe place where we as Mercht: cannot remain with Protection or Security but what we have of our own &amp; that at a large Expence to the Ho. Co., unless immediately redress'd in manner propos'd &amp; that the real Cause of the Agent's not meeting him as requested is entirely owing to indisposition, but our Demands &amp;c. will be the same as now tender'd him whether he meets him or not, all which we hope will have the desir'd effect in obtaining the speedy recovery thereof; The Minutes of these Consultations are alsoenclos'd for Your Honor &amp;c., satisfaction.211 On due inspection into the Pbirmd : sent Us by Mahomet Kia thro' the hands of Mr. Skipp we have on reference to Papers &amp; Letters from the Caun discover 5 ^ there should be the Seals of his Vizier &amp; four Principal Mirzas in which this is deficient, only being attested at the request of Mahomet Kia himself (as he advises Us in one of his Letters), by the Embassador who bro't it &amp; another, &amp; we have in onr resolutions directed Mr. Hallamby particularly to notice to him in his Conference. The Eesidt : &amp; Pactors at Bushire have lately wrote Us several Letters in regard to that Pactory, representing they had the greatest reason to think Carem Caun was dissatisfied with Us, but more particularly by his Behaviour on receiving a letter from the A gent in regard to the Chaub (concerning which letter Your Honor^ &amp;c., have in our former Addresses been advis'd the needfull) never vouchsafing so much as to give a reply thereto but as his Motives for this conduct as represented by the Factors will appear in their Letters to the Agency we now forward Copys thereof for Your Honor, &amp;c.: inspection. Under the 17th by Boat Express we rece'd other Letters from the Factors at The me&amp;{ Bushire enclosing Translate of a Letter from aMercht: at Corrasoon, wherein h e Khan acquaints of the Chaubs having petition'd Carem Oaun for his protection, which petition was accompany'd with large presents &amp; that the Affair aboFemention'd was then certainly in Agitation at the Durbar; The Factors took the Opportunity of sending Us up by another Boat a Quantity of Shalloons not Yendible at that place, also requested permission to purchase a Boat for the service of bringing packets hither &amp; which might also be occasionally employ'd for sending them even to Muscat when requir'd, whereby the Company wou'd save considerably in the Expence of Freighting Beats which we have concUrrd in &amp; now employ'd on this Service. In regard to the Caun's displeasure &amp; his taking the Chaub under his Protection we have resolv'd&amp; actually wrofe the Factors, that in case they find the Hon'ble Company's property liable to any risk by the proceedings of the Caun to advise Us thereof, when we will immediately send them a Yessell for their protection or take the Hon'ble Companys Property entirely a way, that in case the Caun writes them anything regarding Cur War with the Chaub, they are to acquaint him that we are only Auxiliarvs to the Turks unde r whose Govt, we have been injur'd by the Chaub as their Subject &amp; that we require satisfaction from them for our losses; they have also our directions to send their Surplus Cash up by the Savoy Salamaly who will shortly be at their port all which directions &amp; Letters are forwarded for Your Honor &amp;c. more particular information &amp; as they have lately sent Us Musters of Cloths proper for their Market we now embrace this Opportunity of transmitting the same to Your Honor &amp;c. In regard to * Bagdat Eesidency since we have acquainted the Besidt: there of Our Ho.

It was proposed to make this arrangement permanent and the Bombay Government a&amp;ieed on 15th January 1766, and Mr. James Morley, then in Bombay, was appointed Resident at Baghdad, where he arrived in Mav 1867, and relieved Mr. Lyster, who had succeeded F chert Garden. But the Court of Directors disappioved of the measure.212 We have advanc'd Lieut.

We have very maturely and deliberately considered the situation of affairs under your management and are unanimously of opinion it is by no means proper to prosecute any further operations against the Chaub, but in con junction with the Turks or Persians, at the same time we still think amicable measures the best to be pursued if it is possible to brin^ him by that means to suitable terms of accommodation, which from the Tenor of his Sons letter to Captain Nessbitt there seems reason to hope he may and we would therefore immediately on Receipt hereof make another application to him in a proper manner to know if he will come to terms, demanding an immediate and Categorical answer, which should he refuse or decline treating, and you should have no prospect of bringing affairs to a speedy issue, solely with the Turks, the only eligible method which seems then to be left is to make a direct application to Carim Caun for his assistance likewise, so as if possible to act in conjunction with both, tho' as you will observe on referrence to our Honble Masters commands of the 22nd March 1765, they are averse to our entering into any engagements of this sort. You are not to apply to the Caun if it is possible settling with the Chaub without his assistance as nothing but the anxiety we are under to put an end to the troubles and the little prospect there at present seems to be of doing it by any other means, has induced us to give you a latitude for that purpose which we flatter ourselves you will not be obliged to make use of, but if contrary to expectation you should be, the proper method of applying to him will be to send a Gentleman whom we recommend to be Mr. George Shipp from Bussora with a letter from the President now enclosed for that purpose accompanied by a suitable one from the Agent urging our complaint against the Chaub and desiring his assistance for obtaining redress &amp; untill his answer may be received to those letters the vessels must be stationed so as to effectually block up those of the Chaub. 4. It is possible Carim Caun will not agree to assist us against the Chaub, but on condition of our joining him against Meer Mahanna. This is what from our Honble Masters sentiments, we would wish to avoid as we cannot but agree with them that such enterprises are no ways for their interest. You are therefore to be very cautious in your negotiations with Carim Caun so as to avoid if possible giving him an opening for urging sucha request, tho as the214 V bringing the Chaub to terms is now become an object of such importance that the accomplishment thereof by any means in our power seems highly essential to our Honble Masters Credit and Interest we must tho with very great reluctance acquesce in your agreeing to assist the Caun against Meer Mahanna, should you find it impracticable on any other terms to induce him to join us against the Chaub and in such case we would have you endeavour to stipulate the most advantageous terms you can for our Hon'ble Masters previous thereto amongst which the following appears to us very essentialy. First.—A Confirmation of Sadoo Caun's Grants for settling at Bushire expressly mentioning therein that we may be at liberty to build any such Eort or Factory there or elsewhere as we may think proper and mount on it what cannon we please. Secondly—Thai an annual sum at least from 20 to 25,000 Eupees be stipulated to be paid to the Honble Company from tbe Kent of Baneen or Customs of Bushire to defray the expence of keeping a Crnizer always in the Gulph. Thirdly.—A grant of any one of the Islands in the Gulph such a one as may be judged by us best calculated for the purpose in case of their being desirous to settle on an Island. Fourthly. That ample satisfaction be made us for all our losses out of the booty which may be taken from the Chaub whose Vessels must either be des troyed or delivered up to us or at least full security given that they shall never again be employed against us. Fifthly. That one-half of all plunder or Booty of what nature soever taken from Meer Mahanna be delivered up to us. Sixthly. In case of our undertaking an expedition against Meer Mahantia Jointly with Carim Caun and proving successful at Carrach, he may be per- mitted to keep possession of it provided he will engage not to deliver it up to any European po^er whatever except the English in case our Hon'ble Masters should chuse to settle there. 5. The return of the Field peices and their appurtenances taken by the Chaub must be peremptorily be demanded—whether we act jointly with the Turks or Persians or jointly with both. 6. We would have you likewise insert any other stipulations that you may think necessary for the Honble Companys interest in the Gulph, as well for their trade in General as for promoting the Success of the Trade in Ghilan Bilk in particular in respect to which Mr. Jervis has delivered us a letter which we have directed the Factors at Bushire 1o attend to, as as is consistent with our Honble Masters late orders on tbe Subject. 7. Should you be under a necessity of applying to Carim Caun which we again repeat we could wish might be avoided it will be necessary that the Gentle, man who goes to him should carry a handsome present not exceeding 10,000 Bupees, We therefore now send sundry articles for this purpose as &amp; accompany, jng list which wc would have you make up to the above amount in such manner as you may think proper. 8. As from tbe Tenor of your advices there seem some reason to be appre hensive of Danger to our Honble Masters property at Bushire from Carem Cauns resentment in case of our destroying the Chaub without his concurrence as he claims lum as bis subject, You are in all events to take every prudent measure for the Security thereof, and lay it down as a maxim in all your215 Proceedings upon this occasion that despatch is a most essential point we shall therefore rely on your using the most speedy and Mutual means for bringing affairs to a conclusion g.nd be not any longer amused with the promises of the Turks or others should you not think them really in earnest for the Chaubs distraction for even if you do succeed in obtaining payment of the monthly expence incurred by the Military and Marine force, it is by no means a sufficient compensation to our Honble Masters for the want of their Service here. 9. A Supply of Six months provisions for the force already with you, and that now going is sent by these Vessels also Sundry Marine and Military Stores for the particulars of all which you are referred to the enclosed accounts—Such articles as are on board of Chellaby's Ship must be transhipped to the other vessels as soon as possible as we have engaged she shall be cleared in ten daya, You are likewise to tranship to any other vessel the articles on board the Easle Snow which and the Tartar you are immediately to return to us with all the Sick and wounded men and an account of the situation of affairs. This you are on no account whatever to omit doing within 20 days after their arrival or as much sooner as you can as you shall answer to the contrary and if you can possibly spare the Defiance also we earnestly recommend. * * * ^ * * We are, etc.. THOMAS HODGES, etc. B ombay C astle, Iftth January 1767. CLXIV. Agest and Council, Basrah to the Hon'blb Court of Directors. Mat it please your Honobs, 'We forward this address to Your Honors by the way of Aleppo to give cover to a packet received the 31st ultimo from tbe Presidency by the Ka^Mrib^anV and at the same time to enclose a duplicate letter from this factory bearing date rtfiark' the 23rd of the last month. In consequence of the orders received from the and En » lish - Presidency by the Eagle, we now transmit Your Honors the best accounts we can collect as to the rise of the troubles with the Sheikh Shack Soliman. The Chaub is originally a subject of the Turks, and has for many years possessed a considerable territory within their dominions bordering upon the Persian Empire, for which he ought, and did for some years, annully to pay a lar&lt;e sum of money into the Treasury of this Pachaship. A few years after the death of Nadir Shah, and in the troubles that followed it, he also got possession of a terri tory in the Persian dominions, by this means he became a subject of both powers. The territory of Gaban and its districts is the name of that he pos sesses on the Turkish, and Durack, that in the Persian by being in possession of such large territories, and not paying the usual tribute to either power. Owino' to the general decline of the Turks in these parts, and the troubles that then reigned throughout the Persian Empire, he grew in a manner independent of either, and soon became rich by possessing the whole revenue. Judging, how ever, that he should in time be called on by both powers for an account of the arrears due to them, he foresaw that a Marine force would be his greatest, security, and accordingly by degrees raised it to the strength it is at present Demands have been constantly made on him both by Turks and Persians for these arrears, and he as constantly has eluded the payment of them. This dis-216 obedience and several petty robberies his people were daily committing, both by sea and land, at length brought the arms of the Turks upon him. Soliman Pacha in the year 1761 ordered his Mussalim of this place out against them, who with a numerous army marched to Gaban from whence the Chaub fled to his fort at Durack, which is so situated as to render the coming at it a work of great time and trouble. By this he gained his ends, and by means of presents at Baghdad bought his peace with the Pacha when his fort was near falling into the hands of Ali Aga, then General of the Turkish Army. On the commence ment of this war with him in the year 1761 the Government requested of Alexander Douglas, Esqnire, and Mr Stewart, the assistance of the Swallow, then here, which was accordingly judged necessary to be complied with ; but the Turkish forces withdrawing the Swallow returned hither. In the latter end of the year 17^3 Ali Pacha came down himself with a considerable army against him, but knowing they were not equal to the attempt by sea, as his Marine force was considerably increased since the last war, he requested William Andrew Prince, Esquire, than Agent, to assist him with two vessels of Your Honors' then here, the Tartar and Swallow, which it was judged neces sary should be complied with, and was accordingly done. They had several encounters with the gallivats of the Chaub, but peace being again established, our vessels returned hither. In the year 1765 Currin Caun came against him, on which the Chaub fled with his gallivats to sea, and the Caun destroyed his fort at Durack ; yet he was not able to overcome him as he had no Marine force, he therefore contented himself with what he had done and retired from thence. The Caun had in this war requested the assistance of the Turkish galleys and forces that he might utterly destroy him, but the dilatoriness of this Government so chagrined the Caun, that after waiting a short time he retired in disgust. A very short time after the Caun was gone forces came from Bagh dad, with orders to the Mussalim to go out against him. This he accordingly did with his forces and the Captain of the Pacha's galleys, but judging their own Marine force not equal to the Chabus, the Pacha by letter and the Mussa lim here applied to Mr. Wrench, their Agent, for the assistance of an English vessel (the only one then here) called the Fanny Snow, Captain Parkinson. And Captain Parkinson, in consequence of some stipulation with this Govern ment made in his favour by Mr. Wrench, was prevailed on to go on this service; he accordingly went down the river and joined the Turkish galleys which were lying on this side the river with the camp of the Mussalim, while the Chaub's forces and galliyats were opposite to them, and a few shot were some times exchanged. Your Honors' sloop was also employed on this service for the assistance of the Government, but nothing material happened on either side, and a seeming accommodation soon took place : the Mussalim returned to town, and the Chaub dretire. This was about the end of May 1765. On the •10th and 17th July the Chaub took the ' Sally ' and ' Port William.' Your Honors' affairs under the direction of this agency have met with little or no alteration since the date of our.last respects. Notwithstanding the endeavours of Agasy Caun, the Persian Ambassador, with the Chaub Sheikh Soliman to reconcile the disputes in which this country has lately been involved, the Chaub still continues the same evasive methods in hopes to amuse us for an other season, concluding it the only means he has of escaping. Agasy Caun has had a conference with him, and, as the Caun informs us, received rather insult than anything satisfactory, either with respect to the Turks or us : we have been too long amused, and we are afraid Your Honors will think so. With thehopes of bringing this Chaub to proper terms, we would willingly embrace pacific measures; but consistent with your credit, they are not in our power, your interest is our only aim. It is with the greatest reluctance, we beg leave to assure Your Honors, that we find ourselves under the necessity of applying to Carm Caun for settling the tranquillity of this Gulf; it is certainly' in\is power to doit. The Turks are afraid to attempt the reduction of the Chaub without the Caun's permission, and this permission has not yet been granted.' As the only alternative then and that alternative also, recommended to us by our superior at Bombay and Carim Caun being most pressing to have all gentlemen sent up to him to adjust all our disputes and actually to pay us all our losses out of his own treasury as the Embassador has assured us. We have ordrered Mr. Skipp in consequence of the Governor and Council's recom mendation in case it was necessary any gentlemen should be sent to hold him self in readiness for that service and in a few days Defiance is to convey him to Bushire whence he will proceed to Shiraz. In our next address we are in ^reat hopes we shall be able to render Your Honours accounts that will be more satisfactory, the suspense we are in ourselves at present puts it out of our power to send Your Honors any certain advice. We are in the greatest hopes this application will be attended with all the advantages we could wish for, the Turks are very solicitous for it and whilst they throw such large sums into Your Honours'treasury, for the payment of Hodjoo Eusuph's debt, and the maintenance of the fleet, it behoves us to humour them, whenever it can be done with propriety, they consider us now, owing to our fleet at the Haffar, as a kind of canner between Bassora and the territories of the Chaub, and we doubt not are in earnest in the preparations they are making for the march of their army against the Chaub, as soon as ever they are acquainted with the determination of Carim Caun. Thus affairs with the Persians, Turks and Chaub are situated at present. In our instructions to Mr. Skipp we shall strictly adhere to the orders we have received from the presidency regarding them, in their letter by the Defiance under the 18th January 1767, as they seem so well cultivated for Your Honors interest in this Gulf; we do not insert them here as they must have been sent from the Presidency. Your Honors' cruizer the Deponce arrived here the 28th of March, from Bombay and Bushire and the Eagle the 31st immediately from Bombay; the former we have resolved detaining in the Gulf untill we know the result of Mr. Skipp's negotiation with Carim Caun and the Eagle we are returning immediately to Bombay with all our Sick, wounded and unfit for duty. The Bombay Grab, Salimander Bombsmdi part of the small craft are stationed off the Hoffar for the blockade of that river and the remaining small craft are cruizing between the mouth of this river and the Bar to protect the safe import and export of the small merchant vessels to this place. The Hon'ble the President and Council of Bombay having appointed Mr. Henry Moore, A gent for your Honors' affairs in this Gulf, he arrived here on the Eagle, and has received the charge of this factory from the factors. Mr, Moore accordingly takes this earliest opportunity of assuming Your Honours of his best endeavours for your credit and interest and humbly solicit? the honour of your confirming him here. The Mercantile affairs under our management have received no alterations since our last address, except the receivfng 50 bales of Perpts from your ^Factory218 at Bushire wbich thev though at present to consign us by the Deponce that the risk at that Factory might be lessened, whilst army under Laikey Caun continued in the Dashastoua province. We are directed by our superiors at Bombay to enquire what grounds Mr. Bowyeur, your Resident at Bushire, has for the reflections he has thrown out on Mr. Jervis the late Resident there, relative to his conduct at that place, which we shall with all expedition and transmit Your Honors on account thereof. 'We beg leave to apologize to Your Honors for not addressing you upon the sort of paper, it is customary to address you on, but as we have none of it at present here hope Your Honors will forgive it. We are, etc., F. C. M. D. L. G. G. B ussor a : 9th April 1767. CLXV. Agent 4lND Council a.t Basrah George Skipp. Sir The Hon'ble the President and Council of Bombay, having nomi- instructions to nated you as the most proper person for proceeding to the Court of Carim Mr. skipp on his Caun, to endeavour through his interposition, to adjust the disputes that this Country, has lately been engaged in, should we not be able to settle with the Chaub Shaik Soliman, without such interposition, and as you are already well acquainted, no honorable terms can be expected from the Chaub and that there is no prospect of bringing affairs to a speedy and an advantageous issue without the Caun interference. We are the reluctantly obliged to send you to him, and shall now proceed to give you such instructions for your guidance as the nature of your embassy will admit of. Enclosed are such paragraphs of our Superiors commands by the Defiance as relate to the Service you are going on; but we do not suppose they are designed as terms all of which must be possitively be insisted on, should the Caun be possitively averse to them; We must therefore leave it entirely to your discretion to make the best terms with him that you possibly can, having a particular regard to the tenor of the said commands of the Governor and Council if you find it can be done with prudence, and consistent with the principal purport of your negotiation, which is, either the destruction of the Chaub, or a firm and advantageous peace with him. Experience convinces us, it is in the Caun's power alone, to adjust the unhappy disputes in which we have been obliged to take a part, and from his being so very pressing to have one of our Gentlemen sent up to him we hope that he is earnest in our cause—We cannot but be of opinion that the entire destruction of the Cbaub, is the end that is the most to be wished for both the Turks and our own security in a great measure depends upon it; this necessary measure however, perhaps the Caun may be averse to, and offer himself as the mediator only of a peace between us; should such be the case219 even then our situation obliges us to come into it. If the Caun be as anxious for the destruction of the Chaub as we are, you will immediately advise us that we may dispose of our fleet in the most advantageous manner; but if he acts as mediator, we think one of the principal points to be aimed at with the Cann, is his obliging the Chaub to relinquish the Turkish territories and forcing him to reside entirely at Doorack. The destruction of the Chaub's Gallivats as well as ample restitution in money for the Capture of the Fort William and Sally with all the expences our Hon'ble Employers have been at on account our fleet since the arrival of the Bombay Grab &amp; in this Gulph and a secure footing at Bush ire, are points that the Governor and Council most warmly recommend and which we as warmly second. We fear we have not influence enough at the Court of Carim Caun to insist upon any of the terms mentioned in these instructions, as well as in those sent us from the Presidency '&gt; for if the Caun will not grant, how can we compel him ? we have no occasion to recommend to you the proper enforcing of our several requests; when you are with the Caun you will be much better able to judge how to proceed than from the written recommendations that can be given you here. With respect to the assistance the Caun may expect from us against Meer Mahanna; you will observe our Superiors direct that, as a subject very cautiously to be entered upon—The Caun will undoubtedly will very quickly introduce this subject, to which we recommend to you, not to give him the beast encouragement until you are well assured of the measures he may take with respect to the Chaub and the concessions he is willing to make us. The conditions of granting him the assistance he may want against Meer Mahanna, must be either to destroy the Chaub or procure for us— A firm and lasting peace between the Chaub on one part, the Turks and us on the other restitution in money of all he has taken from the English and the sum of One hundred thousand Rupees at least for the expences to which he has put the Company—Secondly Either to Compel the Chaub to give up to the Turks the territory of Gaban, and reside entirely at Doorack, or to remain neuter &amp; let the Turks endeavour the recovery of their own territories. Should the Caun propose our being neutral in the disputes between the Turks and the Chaub ; you are by no means to come into it as neither our interest nor our honor will admit of it. Upon your arrival at Bushire you are to consult with the Eesident there upon such terms as you may jointly think ought to be demanded of the Caun for the Hon'ble Company's interest at that settlement.

M Amba8sader^Agasy We are concerned that from the present situation of affairs it is not in our Khan to the Kaah. power to return the Defiance to Bombay as recommended to us, circumstances It turns out a ^ failure. having obliged us tho with reluctance of making the application pointed out by your Honor &amp;c., to Carim Caun and who by all advices we can get will insist on our giving him assistance against Meer Mahunnu in such case little or nothing could be done without the Defiance and Salamander Bomb,—In our instructions to Mr. Skipp he is enjoined if possible to avoid touching upon this subject, but of this we can have little hopes, if any faith can be put in the report of Thomas Chouse who returned from Schiras in the time of the late Agent, he was sent thither by the Bashaw previous to the Salam Agasy, and his reports are much the same with the advices received from Bushire, in consequence of the Salam Agasy's Embassy to the Persian Court, was that on the 13th ultimo he returned hither having first been at Bagdat to make known his proceedings to the Bashaw in Company with Agasy Caun in quality of Embassador from Carim Caun to us and the Chaub ; on the next day Messieurs Lyster and Skipp waited on the Musaleem at the Servy ; to know the purport of the Embassador's Commissions, who being present, declared Carim Caun had sent him to require of the Chaub to deliver up all such property as he had taken from us, for which purpose he should immediately send a person to demand the same, which should he not immediately comply with, it would plainly prove he had no intentions of being subject to either power, and that when the Caun was advised thereof, he would take proper measures with him, he further informed us the Caun had directed him to declare to us, that he himself would be answerable for the whole of the losses we had sustained by the Chaub and requested that in case the Chaub did not comply with his demands, that the accounts might be delivered him and a Gentleman sent to the Caun; he was answered that the English were highly sensible of the Caun's221 friendship and good intentions towards them, that they had not entered into the war as principals but as allies to the Turks, that their property was seized in their territories, and that we had demanded restitution from the Turks,—that at their particular request we had assisted them with a marine force, but that nevertheless if we could through the mediation of the Caun he fully reimbursed from the Chaub, it would be a convincing proff of the Cauns regard to justice and Esteem for the English Nation and that we should on all occasions be ready to acknowledge it, we also assured him that peace was the only end desired by us whenever the proper restitution was made, in reply to this he only renewed his assurances of the friendship of the Caun for our nation and his earnest desires, that a Gentleman might be sent to Schiras where ample satisfaction would be given us and all other misunderstandings cleared up; he likewise informed us he had a letter from the Oaun which he would deliver us on his coming to the Factory which he accordingly did on the 17th a translate of this letter is now enclosed for your Honor &amp;c., observation. Agreable to what the Embassador advised us he despatched a messenger to the Chaub, to demand full restitution of our property, the answer the Chaub sent as the Embassador informed us was filled with many evasive excuses disputing the account that was sent of our losses, and exaggerated accounts of the losses he had sustained and desired that a person might be sent to settle the account with him—On receiving this answer the Embassador determined to proceed to the Chaub in person and requested we would deliver him exact accounts of our losses which we accordingly did, and which are now—enclosed—The Embassador on the 23rd ultimo went to the Chaub, and had a conference with him —On his return under the 29th he informe 1 us that notwithstanding his utmost endea vours had been exerted to bring about a reconcilliation between us the Turks and the Chaub, he had rather rec'd insult from him than any thing satisfactory, he added that his Commission from the Caun was fully complyed with, still he would make another effort with the Chaub and send a Choppur again, to require of him to deliver up, all such property as he might have belonging to the English and immediately to send it in boats to the Haffar when proper Eeceits should be given him, but that on his non-compliance he should immediately set out to Schiras and advise his master of the result of his Embassy; The Choppur returned without bringing any satisfactory answer to this last message and the Embassador in company with the Salam Agassy set oiff the 8th Instant for Bagdat previous to his departure he waited on the Agent in this visit he renewed his former assurances of friendship and again requested that a Gentle man might be sent with ail expedition to the Caun to whom he had wrote leaving the letter to be carried thither by Mr. Skipp as a letter of introduction to Mr. Skipp—three days after the arrival of this Embassador it was we were honored with your Commands of the i8th January which having taken into due consideration, and in particular that part, which mentions the application to the Chaub, in order to demand a categorical answer from him whether he was inclined, to deliver up our property or not; TTe humbly apprehended that by the interference of Carim Caun such application was then improper as the Cauns Embassador had already complied therewith, by requiring the same but two days before, and in a manner much more effectual than was in our power to do by representing to him, that he was not only sent by the Caun but also by the English between whom his master had now became Umpire, and that his non-compliance with our demands would certainly bring on him the Caun resentment—the interfering here as principals at this juncture, must have tended222 in our opinions to our own disadvantage by affording the Chaub an opportunity of using his accustomed piece of Crafts, that of treating seperately and thereby the amusing of all party8 in order to spin out another season, besides we thought it would be slighting the Caun's offer of becoming a midiator, and if the Caun should think so and of course he must and consequently would be of the greatest prejudice, not only to our Hon'ble Master's affairs here, but at Bushire particularly; in this light we flatter ourselves your Honor &amp;c , will consider this deviation from this part of your Commands, which nothing but our being on the spot and the conviction of its being for the Hon'ble Company's interest could have enduced us to do.

The duplicate of our last advices dated the 12th and 13th September and Council at , Basrah. with duplicate extracts from our Diary and Consultations to that ti me, are ^K^ri^KhaJsinclosed—we inclose also the continuation of those extracts brought down to the present date, and shall now lay before you the reasons for this despatch. 2. Under the 30th of last month we received by the rout of Bushire two letters from Mr. Skipp adviseing us that Carim Cauu had at length consented to the paying us the demand we made on him of five lacks of Rupees, and that it should be delivered to whomsoever, we might appoint to receive it; as soon as we informed him that our squadron was ready to proceed against Meer Mahanna of Carrack—The Gaun has withdrawn also his protection from the Chaub, and gives us free liberty to attack him (but anassisted by the Turks) at any time or any place that we may think proper to attack him in the grand point however, which is the delivery up of the Ohaub's Gallivats', and which we must even think a point of the greatest consequence still remains uncon- quered however, as the Caun by the most solemn written engagement is willing to be responsible for their inactivity—nay even assures us of his detestation of the Ohaub and that the Gallivats shall still be ours, though his present connection with the ohaub will not in honor admit of their being immediately so and premisses to repay us not only ten fold in case they ever again molest but also to destroy the Chaub, and all his possessions if they should, we have thought it for your Honors interests, so far to temporize with the Caun, as to give him reason to expect though not by direct promise, that he should shortly receive the assistance he requires of us : that is, if the Governor and Council at Bombay approve of our giveing it to him 3. The matter of consideration with us has been, whether the delivery up of the Chaub's Gallivats was an article still to be insisted on, or whether we had not better relax somewhat of our demands, than commence the hostilities we intended. Moore's allegation 4. From the whole tenor of the Caun's proceedings ever since we have been against Kanm ^ -^h Mm, he has shewn himself a character in regard to us, by far too wavering and capricious to have the least reliance on his premisses in case we would assist him against Meer Mahanna, seem to us as already observed to be unbounded, to be realy valuable : and though we have on the Caun's term renounced that article of our demands which insisted upon the delivery up of the225 Chaub's Gallivats, and have conditionaly promised him the assistance lie wants against the Meer, still we think the probability great, that the Caun may again alter his resolution and render the payment of the five lack of Unpees a circums tance very doubtful and dependent on innumerable contingencies however. * * « * * 11. Another point remains to be considered that is admitting the Honor- Policy suggested, able the President and Council of Bombay should think it for your Honor's interests to join the Caun against Meer Mahanna of Carrack and success attend us there, whether that same interest does not further exact a vigourous exertion against the Chaub, and thereby endeavour to finish our affairs with him in a manner both honorable and advantageous this end of the Gulph can never be in quiet whilst the Chaub's Gallivats continue in his possession : the Chaub effectualy reduced, and commerce may again revive—a few months exerted with vigour may place the affairs of this Gulph upon a good and solid basis omitted and the opportunity may never again present itself. 12. Exclusive of our not having the least reliance upon the Turks, the Caun's threats have so intimidated them, that we have not from that quarter any thing to expect : we will endeavour all in our power to procure for them the territory of Gaban, or at least, so far influence the Caun in their favor, as to obtain his neutrality in case they should ever be surprized with spirit sufficient to obtain their own satisfaction from the Chaub—wretches as they are however sound policy dictates the appearance of friendship with them, and as we are now upon the best of terms, so will we endeavour to continue. ***** 17. We were in very great expectations that the government's Customs on M€ex Mohana fle#e4g the imports of Coffee this reason, would have admitted of some decrease in the fl h e e eti f raskat Coffee Governments debt due to your Honours : but hitherto no more than 17q bales of Coffee have been received here : this quantity was imported chiefly by the Suree boats : they brought from Muscat with them 550 bales : but in their passage to Bussora, Meer Mahanna under the pretext of Customs, and a kind of compulsory commerce squeezed from them 380, there are now from 1000 a 1200 bales of this year's Coffee laying at Muscat, the owners of which, on account of the Meer are afraid to venture any higher Lieutenant Hall in the Tyger Schooner is directed to convoy it up to Bussora, should not the departure of the Suness Captain Lyon from Muscat oblige him to proceed on to Bombay. 18. Mr. Lyster is engaged at the Temaar &amp; Meherza gathering dates in what dates he possibly can : but owing to the Chaub's interruptions, we fear th0 quantity will fall far short of what was at first represented to us. ***** Hon'ble Gentlemen Your very faithful &amp; obedient servant, HENRY MOORE. B ussora : The 5ik October 1767. . CLXX. Consultation of the Agent and Council at Busrah, dated Friday, 9th October 1767. 1. The endeavouring to recover the pearl and treasure taker from the Isla- Expedition npainst mabad in February 1765 by some Arab Lascars belonging to the ship who upoll! de ' lded226 murdered the Captain Herbert Sutherland and his officers when the Islamabad lay at an anchor at a place called Magoo upon the Persian shore, is now taken into consideration. 2. It appears on reference to the Bushire letters wrote by Mr. Jervis to this Agency under the 16th March, 24th April, and 16th May 1765 : that after the murder of Captain Sutherland etca. the Arabs who were the murderers plundered the ship of money and pearls, to a very considerable amount, with which plunder they proceeded to the island of Khist: on their arrival there: the Shaik of that island seized the stolen treasures, bound the murderers, and sent them in a small boat over to the continent of Persia. 3. It further appears that Nassir Khan the Governor of Lahoor had sent a considerable force against the island of Khist under the command of Shaik Abdulla of Ormuse ; this said Shaik accordingly took from the Shaik of Khist the pearls and treasure belonging to the Islamabad, which he had taken from the Arab Lascars who as before mentioned were both the murderers and the thieves. 4. Mr. Jervis further observes in his letter of the 16th March, that the village on the Island of Khist according to his intelligence was a very defenceless unfortified place, and that a very triffling force would be sufficient to oblige the Shaik to deliver up the money, &amp;c. the Tartar and sloop he imagined would be sufficient. 5. Captain William Justice, the Commander of the Berkshire, in a letter to Mr. Wrench regarding this same subject writes from Muscat under the 19th September 1766, that, &lt;c Agreable to his promise he had enquired at Gombroon concerning the Islamabad's treasures; that it was taken from the Shaik at Khist by Nassir Khan and Shaik Abdulla the former was taken by Carim Caun in the fall of Lahore, and was then in his custody—the latter, Shaik Abdulla was on the island of Ormuse—that he was with him 3 or 4 days at Ormuse but gave him not the least hint of our suspecting him to have any part of the Islamabad's treasures—that his fort was all in pieces, and not one of his Gun Carriages but what was useless : that his fort was all in pieces, and not one of his Gun Carriages, hut what was useless : that his Gallivats were all in very bad order that our ships could go within hail of the fort, and that if they were to go, the Fort could not hold out two hours.' 6. On this same subject, the Honorable the President and Council of Bombay under the 5th January 1766 and Bombay Grab wrote this Agency as follows. 7. 'We have been informed restitution of the whole or great part of the treasure and effects taken from the Islamabad may be obtained, if proper measures are pursued for that purpose ; if this is really the case, we permit of your employing the force for that purpose, as soon as the service against the Chaub is over; and you are accordingly to give such orders to the commanding officers, as you may judge most likely to answer that end; observing that what ever treasure stores or effects may be taken either on this occasion, or from the Chaub, must be kept in deposit untill our orders are received concerning them.' The whole of this intelligence relative to this unfortunate affair being thus collected, and the permission given us regarding it by the Honourable the President and Council of Bombay duely considered, we think a more seasonable opportunity for endeavouring to recover the Islamabad's treasures from Shaik Abdulla of Ormuse, will never present itself—our reasons for it are. Our operations against the Chaub are entirely at a stand, untill we know the determinations of our Superiors at Bombay—to whom our situation is fully227 explained in our letter of tlie 1st instant by the Tyger Schooner and from whom, it is not probable we shall receive advices untill December or January next. Either the Defiance or Bombay Grab with a Schooner and Gallivat are sufficient for the protection of the Haffar, or any other services that this end of the Gulph can at present require; situated as our affairs are just now with Carim Caun, Bushire needs not the protection of our vessels—one or other there fore of the before mentioned Capital Cruizers, and the Salamander, will be for three months entirely inactive, unless we employ them upon the present expedition. By undertaking this expedition just now we save a considerable deal of time because, neither our honour, nor the service which our Superiors at Bombay are so desirous of doing to the owners and freighters of the Islamabad, would cleverly admit of the Cruizes leaving this Gulph, without endeavouring something for their benefit. Though Shaik Abdulla of Ormuse was neither the murderer of Captain Sutherland and his officers, nor the person who was immediately concerned in the plunder of the Islamadab, still, as by all accounts he is in pos session of that ships treasures, knowing them to be stolen, and has not been sufficiently honorable to return them to us. Justice most assuredly demands this restitution. In a letter from Mr. Skipp dated Schiras the 4th August 1767, he mentions Carim Caun desires that we would reduce this said Shaik Abdulla of Ormuse for him: he further observes that the Caun consents to our keeping the Ship that now lays there and all the Gallivats that may be taken from him it is not there fore reasonable to imagine Crim Caun would be in the least disgusted at our demanding restitution of the Islamabads treasures, nor at the same time as Allies to Carim Caun, insisting upon the delivery up of the Chaub's ship and Gallivats to him. By this we convince him of our power, we convince him of the conse quence of our Alliance: we give him a testimony how willing we are to be his friends if his mistaken friendship for the Chaub and ignorance of his own interests does not prevent our being so. The next point to be considered is the force to be employed upon this occasion. _ . ^ . . We have no other guide to go by, than that mend,, in Captain Justices letter entered in the preceding part of these considerations and that, sets down Ormuse in a state almost defenceless—there is no doubt therefore but that the Defiance, the Salamander Comb, and Wolf Gallivat with a strong Detachment of Military 'and Seapoys on board them, as our present situation will admit, will be sufficient for the purpose we intend. We are now in daily expectation of the Bombay Grab from Bushire: oh the Defiance sailing therefore for Ormuse, the Grab will be ready to relieve that Ship in the blockade of the Haffar; our wishes are to have employed the Grab upon this expedition : but, as the season of the year gives reason to explicit blowing weather in the Gulph, and the Grab from age and infirmity would not be so well able to buffet with it as the Defiance we for that reason prefer the Defiance for this service. n i j The force to proceed against Ormuse being thus fixed, it natuaraUy leads US to the consideration of the measures to be pursued on the arrival of the Defiance etca off Ormuse. , In regard to this point we are of opinion that, hostile measures be avoided, if affairs with Shaik Abdulla can be settled by treaty : the first object to be demanded of him, is ample restitution of the treasures belonging to the228 Islamabad, which from the best accounts we can collect here from the broker whom Captain Sutherland employed amounted to upwards of four lacks of Eupees frieght etca. included exclusive of this we demand one hundred thousand Bupees for the Honble Company and forty thousand for the Captors—the second, the delivery up to us as Allies to Carim Caun, the Ship and all the Gallivats belonging to the said Shaik Abdulla—the third an entire renunciation of the island of Ormuse to us, or to whomsoever Carim Caun may think proper to appoint the Governor thereof. Should Shaik Abdulla refuse treating the grand objects then are to ge t possession of the ship and Gallivats, and of the Shaik's person, which is to be done by whatever method the commander of the Marine and Military depart ments judge most effectual. Should the island be taken by force, we would have it immediately delivered over into the hands of such Commissaries as may be hereafter appoint ed who are to take possession of all treasures stores etca. that may be found upon the island ***** 0 f which the most exact inventories are to be taken : they are then to be loaded on board the several vessels, employed on this Service, and sent immediately to Bussora — if Carim Caun appoints proper people to receive charge of the island from our Agents, they are then to deliver it over, but if not they are to leave the island and repair hither, as the turn our affairs may take in this end of the Gulph, will not admit of our leaving a Garrison on Ormuse, which is so remotely situated. Carim Caun to be duely advised of our designs against Ormuse, our motives for going, and to desire he would appoint proper persons to receive the charge of it, should our forces have the good fortune to take it. This service performed the credit of our Honble Employers then points out to us, to order this small division of our forces to demand satisfac tion of the Shaik of Charrack for his taking our armed boat in the month of may last on her return from Muscat for his cruelty to our people, and for his insolence in saying the English were not equal to his shoes. Eestitution of the boat and her cargoe which according to Mr. Bowyear's account to us was valued at ten thousand Rupees, we cannot consider in the light of an adequate : we would therefore by every military exaction, have the Shaik of that place convinced of his insolence : we would have all his Gallivats taken the Shaik seized, and be made to pay as largely, as so poor a Shaikdom will admit we would then have him brought a prisoner to Bushire and there be disposed of as Carim Caun may think proper. As Mr. Bowyear in his letter to us of the 25th of May 1767 mentions that a great part of the Islamabads treasure was then at Keys the fleet to take that uland on their return, and to demand of the Shaik some accounts of it. Commodore Price to be orde red to take burn, sink and destroy every fighting ijallivat he meets with during his cruize, except those belonging to Meer Mahanna. Mr. Dymoke Lyster and Mr. William Bowyear to be appointed joint managers in this negotiation and the necessary instructions to be prepared for them.

Extract from the Basrah Factory Diary No. 5 oj 1867-68. Arrived the Salamander Bomb commanded by Lieutenant Gage, who brings Omuz expedition ns the melancholy account of the loss of the Defiance Commodore Fountain ot tk9 Price, that ship having blown up, under the 15th November, on an expedition a gainst Ormuse, in sight of the island of Kishmee: as the following extract from Lieutenant Gage's Journal particularizes the event, it is herewith melancholy transcribed. Extract from Lieutenant Oage's Journal with respect to the Uowing up of the Ship Defiance. Saturday 14th. Pleasant land and Sea breezes at 4 P. M., observed the Commodore haul up with an intention of going between the island of Kishmee and the Main-d. haul up after her, at 8 P. M., anchored in J less 4 fathom by the Defiance at day light the Southermost end of Kishmee S.E.B.E. off shore about 4 leagues. Sunday 15th. At 1 P. M., weighed in Company with the Defiance Launch, and Trankey, steered E.N.E. till 9 P. M., then anchored by the Defiance.—At 11 P. M., the fleet weighed, wind N.B.E., at J past 1 A. M. the Defiance was taken aback, and came to an anchor—at the same time the Commodore ordered me to stand on as long as the flood run. At -J past 2 A, !M., observed some thing on shore of us, took it to be a large trankey under sail; fired a shot at he r to bring her too, soon after heard a great noise on board her; at 8clo. fired 3 shot more at her, discoverd her to be a large ship at Anchor, she fired several musquets at us out of her tops; we past her about a musquet shot distance, and anchored to the Eastward of her within Gun shot; made the signal to the Commodore of seeing a strange ship, and immediately despatchd Lieutenant Kerr to the Commodore to acquaint him that we was at Anchor by a strang e ship. At this time the Defiance was at Anchor by a strange ship. At thi s time the Defiance was at anchor distance from us about 4 miles. Lieutenant Kerr acquainting the Commodore that we was at anchor by the ship, weighed and stood towards us and we at times burnt blue lights to let the Commodore see where we was—there being little wind and the tide of ebb against him, he could not get near us, and a little after day light the Defiance anchored, distanc from the ship about a mile and from us about miles—found with the ship 3 Gallwats and four armed Trankeys. At 7 clo. Lieutenant Kerr returned acquainting me that the Commodore intended attacking the ship, and board her as soon as possible, and to keep our boats manned and armed, in case he should make the signal for her—all this time the ship and Gallwats making prepara tions. At 8 A. M. the Launch with the Commodores boats was along side him taking the Military upon boarding the ship. At f past 8 saw a smoke from the Defiance took it to be a gun fired from her, but to our great surprize she blew up in less than two minutes after— we were then about a mile and a half distance from tier, hut to our great surprize she blew up in less than two minutes after— %ce were then about a mile and a half distance from her, but could not observe any men living about the wreck ; indeed the explosion was so great that we could not think it was possible that there was any men saved from her—the enemy immediately on seeing this, manned their ship and Gallwats, with a number of men that was not seen before, which prevented us from getting under sail and making towards the wreck, but if we had weighed, we should have dropt on board the ship, it being strong tide of Ebb, and no mind at 9 a. m . observed230 tlie enemys trankeys under way, and thought they were making for our Trankey, that had about forty Seapoys in: on which the trankey weighed and stood back agin—but we soon saw the enemys trankey alongside the wreck getting what they could out of her. At 11 a.m. the enemys trankeys returned from the wreck and went on shore; soon after the tide of flood making, and thinking it was impracticable for us to pretend to engage the enemy, they having so many vessels, and such a number of men, thought it more prudent for us to make the best of our way to Gombroon road to join the Wolf Gallivat, who had parted company with us the 12th instant and then to proceed to Kishmee to endeavour to water, having only one Tank of water on board, and then to make the best of our way to Bussora or Bushire according as our water held' out. Monday the 16th. Saw some Europeans on shore, sent our boat to see who they were, we then being to the Eastward of the Enemy about 1J miles—the boat soon after returned with 10 Seamen, 1 Soldier, 10 Hasears, 8 Seapoys, 2 Topasses, 2 Servants belonging to Mr. Bawyear 1 servant belonging to the Commodore, and a black Carpenter who informed us they-were saved by being in the forepart of the ship, and says the ship was L blown up by the carelessness of the Gunner, and Steward who had a candle down in the after hold drawing Arrack oS which took fire. The foregoing thirty five men are all that were saved of 3 hundred more there were eighty six Europeans, Military, on board, about as many European seamen and the remainder consisted of Seapoys and hasears: the gentlemen who unfortunately perished by this sad event, are Commodore Fountain Price WH^Bawyear } Joillt mana g ers on tlie Ormuse expedition Captn.

CLXXXII. President and Governor and Council, Bombay, to the Right Wo. H enry M oore , Esq., Agent for all affairs of the the British Nation in the Gulph of Persia, etca, Council at Bussora. Gentlemen, We have received your several letters of the 16th and 17th April, 26th July GeorgeSkipp to be and 18th August, 11th September and 1st ultimo, with the several papers and sentto shiraz to accounts agreeable to the lists of the respective packets all which are now wit h Karim Khan, under our consideration and shall shortly be fully replied to by the Tarter snow Meer Sanf lad and Fancy Bombketch which are getting ready to proceed to you with such theKaab - supplies of men and stores as they can carry, and the latter as nearly conform* able to your indents as possible.231 The terms last offered by Carim Caun as mentioned in Mr. Skipp's letter to you of the 16th September appears to government so very advantageous that they thought they should by all means have been accepted agreable to the latitude given the agency for that purpose, but as it was thought proper to defer it until order could be received from Bombay Agency was now to send back Mr. George Skipp to Schiras with full and ample power to conclude a treaty with Carim Caun upon the terms ofiered by him which being effected the special measures were to be pursued for reducing Meer Mahanna and Shaik Abdulla at Ormuse in conjunction with his forces taking care however to pursue the necessary measures for securing Bussora against any attempts of the Chaub during the absence of our vessels at Carrac either by a peremptory order from Carim Caun, or keeping a sufficient force for that purpose—but of this and the measures to be pursued in case of our being successful against that island we shall by the Tartar give you further directions only now adding that the Caun's offers in respect thereto are to be stipulated on the treaty. It will be necessary also to insert therein the prices of the Woollens which he engages to take off annually and this we would have done as nearly conformable to the Bushire prices as you can though if the Caun should object thereto we must acquiesce in theit being reduced but shall rely on its being done in as small a degree as possible, and in respect to the prices to be stipulated for the Ghilan raw silk and Carmania wool you will of course be guided by our Honourable masters orders on this subject, the Copper or any other articles which may be proper to take in Exchange for woollens you must endeavour to procure on the best terms you can but we think the prices should be stipulated in the treaty. 3. That no time may be lost in communicating our intentions to the Caun, the Factors at Bushire are ordered to forward a letter now wrote him by the President (of which we now enclose a copy for your notice) the moment they receive it and we shall depend on your despatching Mr. Skipp with the utmost expedition. 4. We fear from the present situation of oitr own affairs, it will not be in our power to send you any more vessels than the Tartar Bumbketch, and by them we propose compleating the force you now have to what was originally sent into the Gulph and sending you a further reinforcement of Artillery men under the Command of Captain Lawrence Nelson, with some heavy cannon. Field pieces, and stores in proportion, and this will be the utmost we can do to assist you. A supply of Medicines and Stationary, which you represent you are so much in want of is now sent you by the Tyger, and a further quantity will go by the Tartar. Inclosed is a packet for our Honourable Masters which must be forwarded with the utmost expedition; we also inclose sundry paragraphs of their commands received since we last wrote you to which a strict and due obedience must be paid. 6. Great irregularities having been found to arise from the Commanders of the vessels in Persia being allowed to keep a table at the Honourable Company's expence without any limitation , we have determined that they shall be allowed to charge at the rate of two Rupees per day for every person whether European Turks or Persians, they may be under the necessity of entertaining at their tables, which you are to make good to them accordingly, and finally adjust all accounts relative to their vessels before their return to India.232 7. Should circumstances be such as to render it in your opinion necessary to land a force to act in conjunction with the Caun, we must acquiesce therein notwithstanding our former restrictions in this respect relying however on your making use of this latitude with the utmost caution. 8. It is possible the Oaun may have taken umbrage at the delay in answer ing his proposals, and Mr. Skipp's hasty departure and may in such case fly off ^rom them; on such an event we must depend on your palliating the same and endeavouring to settle affairs with him in the best manner in your power for bringing these troubles to a favourable issue, except making war, or entering into any alliance against the Oaun, whether with Meer Mahanna or other wise, both which we positively forbid, as we think it of great consequence to ^ cultivate a friendship with the Caun, as has ever been done with the Kings of Persia, and the absence of so large a part of our Marine and Military force is of very great prejudice to our Honorable masters interest here, and greatly embarrasses our affairs.

By the Betsey which we are in daily expectation of from Bushire the ■ ^ Governor and Council have consigned us 100 one hundred bales of Broad Cloth, amounting to Eupees thirty thousand, five hundred sixty nine, three, quarters and twenty seven reas (30569-3-27) this consignment consists of Coarse Cloth, and of colours which we hope will enable us to get off a considerable part of our heavy remains; your Honours may depend on our exerting ourselves to the utmost, in this, as well as in every other branch of your affairs that comes under our management. 3. The Bombay Grab is now taking in Mr. Skipp's necessaries, and will sail to-morrow for Bushire, in order to convey that gentleman to that place, whence he will proceed immediately to Schiras ; the Haffar is now blockaded by two Schooners, a Gallwat and some small Turkish vessels, which we have will keep every thing quiet there until the return of the Bombay Grab. ^233 4.

In a former letter to your Honors we mentioned the resolution we had taken of furnishing such Country boats with English passes, as the owners ot them might apply for on paymg us one hundred Rupees for each pass -these orders extended to Bushire. The Resident in consequence wrote us, that he would put our orders into execution, but desired to know whether Countrv merchant trading to Bushire under our colours and playses, were not to pav Customs to your Honors at that port. In reply to this we have observed we do not think ourselves entitled to exact any customs on the propertv of Country merchants trading to Bushire, neither do we think the Caun would admit of it that the merchants under that class 10 pay from 8 or 9 P cent at the Persian Custom House, and the trade would ill bear an additional duty of 5 We were induced to this because we thought that the fewer duties commerce is' loaded with the greater the probablity of an increase in that commerce, and the greater the commerce and resort of merchants to Bushire, the greater the prospect of advantage to your Honors; the meaning of our pass is no more than a protection for Country merchant boats at sea, by which Meer Mahanna may be induced not to molest them; on this acount passes we have received about seven hundred Rupees. 8. A letter which the Agent yesterday received from the Kia at Ba^dat mentions the resolution of sending one of his principal Agas to Schiras, in order to cooperate with Mr. Skipp in the negotiations that we are now enterin- upo n. 0 9.

In our abovementioned letters, you were advised of our intentions to send the Tartar Snow into the Gulph, but she proving leaky we have been obliged to substitute the Eagle in her stead and the Wolf Ganivat arriving here the 20 th ultimo with the melancholy account of the Defiance having been by some unhappy accident blown up near Loft we have deemed it absolutely necessary to enable you to comply with the agreements we have ordered you to enter into with the Caun to determine on sending the Revenge to replace her; that ship is accordingly now getting ready, and will sail in a few days with theEssue, a country ship we have freighted to assist in carrying the men and stores intended you, for the particulars of which we must refer you to the inclosed accounts, and such others as may hereafter be transmitted you, only here remarking that the men are intended to compleat the number originally sent into the Gulph, allowing for those lost on the Defiance, with a further reinforce ment of Artillery, and the stores are as nearly conformable to your Indents, as our own stock of the several Articles would admit of our sparing; Captain Lawrence Nilson will proceed on the Eevenge to take upon him the command of the land, and Captain Elphinstone will of course (in case of Captain Price being lost in the Defiance) succeed to that of the Marine force, and we doubt not but by your prudent management, and their united efforts, we shall at last succeed in the accomplishment of our wishes in the Gulph. 3. The Eagle and Success Snow Fancy Bomb Ketch and the Wolf Ganivat are now dispatched with part of the men and stores and the Eevenge and Essue, will as above noticed go now in a few days. The Wolf is ordered to make the best of her way from Muscat with a skort letter advising you of the particular force sent, that you may lodge such orders as you may judge proper at Bushire, where the vessels are ordered to wait untill directions are received from you, and which, should it not be before done, you will take care to dispatch without a moments loss of time. ****** 8. It affords us very great satisfaction to perceive you have recovered part of Hod gee Esooph's Debt, and we shall rely on your exerting your utmost endeavours for securing the remainder by every suitable means in your power, and prevent the Government running in arrears either in the payment of this money or the sum stipulated for defraying the expences of the fleet in which we shall expect you will attend to obtaining an increase in proportion to the additional force which may be sent more than what was with you when that sum was fixed. 9. The resolution taken and orders given by you to the Factors at Bushire in consequence of M?- Shiepp's first letters for committing hostilities against235 Carim Caun and destroying that Town and the vessels laying there, we very Agency decision to highly disapprove, and are astonished you could possibly take such a stepJ^fiMm™ without our previous sanction, a step so evidently repugnant to our orders, Kb ' n di ' ppr0TCd - your own lastructions to M?* Skipp, and our Honorable masters repeated com mands, for avoiding as muoh as possible all hostile measures. The orders too for this measure were so very peremptory that in all probability it would have been carried into execution (from which very bad consequences might have ensued) had it not been for the prudence of the Oaun in not suffering Afc. Skipp to leave his Court, and afterwards to that of the Factors at Bushire in waiting for further directions from you after the receipt of the Oaun's last proposals. 10. We cannot likewise but remark a striking inconsistency of your pro- Characters of posing an alliance with Meer Mahanna a man whom in your address to the Meer m Moha a nna na Honorable Company under the 29^ June you yourselves represent in a most C(),:npared • infamous light, indeed altho in a subsequent one of the 16*3 July you seem to have entirely changed your opinion respecting him and without any one good reason assigned you propose the alliance with him here alluded to your asserting in your letter of the 11^ September, that this man had never injured us is also a very great mistake, as he formerly destroyed our Factory at Bunderick and obliged our Resident to fly the shore, exclusive of which in your abovementioned address of the 29^ June you yourselves represent him as the scourge of the Gulph, and say that you impute his civility to the English to no one motive but the fear of our Cruizers; neither can we by any means concur with you in opinion that the woollens he might take off annually could be any thing like an equivalent to the Honorable Company for the loss of that trade to them in the kingdom of Persia, not to mention their investments there of Carmenia wool and Raw silk which they would likewise be deprived of. 11. As to Carim Caun we do not recollect any one instance of his having ever injured us, nor can we adopt the opinion you seem to have entertained of his being an unsteady character, for hie strict adherence to his word passed the Chaub, his resolute refusal of the present carried to him by Mr. Skipp until affairs were settled, as well as other instances of his conduct mentioned in different parts of your advices make him appear to us in a very different light. ****** 21. We have determined in case of proving successful against Carrack, to keep possession of it untill our Honorable Masters pleasure can be known regarding it, for as the Dutch by the best information we can obtain only rented the island, they can claim no just pretensions to it, or allowing they even do claim it, their claim can be of no validity, as we shall become possessed of it not as a conquest of our own, but by virtue of a grant from Carim Caun. You are therefore in case of success to keep such a force on the island as you (after consulting with such officers as you may think proper) may judge necessary considering all circumstances, and at the same time order Captain Nilson to survey it very carefully, and deliver in a plan of it to you to be transmitted to us with the best information you may be able to obtain of the island itself the anchorage, climate, and every other particular neces sary for enabling us to form a proper judgment of the advantages or disadvan tages of its situation. 22. From the Caun's offering to become security that the Chaub shall not hereafter molest our trade, we are of opinion after joining our forces with his236 Guard ressel for the Gulf. Appointments. and proving successful against Carrack, he 'does not mean we should commit hostilities against the Chaub, unless provoked thereto by fresh depredations, and even in that case we think it should be with the Oaun's concurrence. 23. Should we enter into a treaty with the Caun we concur in keeping a Guard vessel always in the Gulph, provided he agrees to defray the expence which will thereby be incurred, in which case it must be stipulated in the treaty in such a manner that no disputes may hereafter arise regarding it, and which from a calculate laid before us will not turn out less for a first rate than Rupees 62,440 and for a second Rupees 40,099 per annum. ****** 32. We are very much at a loss to conceive what service the Defiance and other vessels were going upon when the accident happened to her, as in your address to us of the It October you expressly say you should remain entirely inactive untill you received our further orders which you expected might reach you in about three months. 33. On a supposition that Messieurs Lyster and Bawyear (who we hear were on board the Defiance) are unhappily lost we have appointed M r - John Beaumont to succeed the former at your place who with William Lewis likewise appointed to the assistance of your place, now proceed having received their salary to the 2~ d instant and diet for last month; but should Lyster contrary to expectation be saved, even in that case M r Beaumont is to remain as M r r .Lyster must agreeable to the Honorable Companys Commands repair to the Presidency by the first opportunity. M?: James Morley is appointed Resident at Bushire in the room of William Bowyear, and we have joined with him George Green who will embark upon the Essue. Messieurs Beaumout and Lewis are to take their seats at your board agreeable to their standing. 34. Inclosed is copy of such paragraphs of our Honourable Masters com mands of the 4£ April last, as relate to your settlement to which a due obedience must be shown, you will in consequence advise those who have claims on the Estate of Martin Erench to make application to the Honourable Company in England, such paragraphs as you may judge it necessary for the Eactors at Bushire to be made acquainted witk you will of course transmit copy. ****** 37. In the treaty with Carim Caun it must be stipulated in general terms that our Honorable Masters are to have the exclusive right to the trade in his Dominions^without particularly naming any other Europeans whatever. B ombay C astle, The 15th January We are Your loving friends, THOMAS HODGES. DANIEL DRAPER. JAMES RYLET. R. HART BODDAM. BENJAMIN JERVI8.237 CLXXV. George Skiep to Henet Mooee , Agent, etca., Conaoil at Bnssora. Gentlemen, Agreeable to what I wrote you in the enclosed I waited on the Vackee], A g r ? emen t with and he again after much discourse confirmed his former promises, and ordered a writing to be drawn out for that purpose, which he the next day sent me a translate of which I now enclose you under 2, it contains an obligation for the payment of 15,000 Tamaunds after the capture of Carrack, a grant of the island etca., also an obligation on his part to be responsible for any damage which should in future be incurred by the Chaub on our part, under N?. 3 you will also receive a translate of the Vackeel's orders to the Chabb, in which you will please to observe the Turks and all others are included, this order he now dispatches to the Chaub a copy thereof signed and attested he has delivered to me, another copy he has also delivered to the Ohaub's Agent and his son giving them at the same time the most positive injunctions to go and inform the Chaub, if he in any shape broke these orders he might depend on his severest resentment. With respect to the priviledges he last year promised to grant us of a free and open commerce throughout his dominions, he gave me his most solemn promise he would grant the whole of it as soon as he found we really intended to assist him, and, as he has some points to settle with the Shaiks of Bushire before he opened the road from thence, he must defer giving the grants till that which would be concluded shortly. On the Vackeel delivering the abovementioned papers, I promised him that all our forces in the Gulph either at Bussora or Bushire should proceed to hostilities against the Meer and do their utmost to take Carrack, my reasons for which I hope I have explained to your satisfaction in the accompanying address, and I have now to request you will be pleased to direct my promise given to the Vackeel may be carried into execution as soon as possible after the receipt of this address. Untill the papers were actually delivered me I could not be certain the Vackeel would accept of our service against Carrack, the Shaiks of Bushire and all their party were daily urging him to reject our proffered service, and they offered to undertake it, this however the Vackeel did not entirely confide in, but a few day^ ago the brother of Shaik Abdulla of Ormus arrived with Offer of his Fci'ce and then jointly with the Shaiks of Bushire requested they might perform that service for him, and I believe to the last moment the Vackeel was in Doubt, whether he should or should not accept thereof, when the addition of Shaik Abdulla's force joined to the Shaiks of Bushire was offered to the Vackeel I began much to fear he would accept thereof, he at last however sent me the papers, and declared to them he has passed his word to the English to grant them many favours and immunities on condition of their rendering him that service and he would not break his word to them, as affairs were so critically circumstanced here, I was glad to get the papers at any rate, his rejecting our assistance against Carrack would have been also a refusal of concerning himself any further in our sffairs with the Chaub, and though affairs are not concluded near so favourably us we could wish at present, yet at the same time the Vackeel does and all along has declared that as soon as ever we render him some service by which he may be convinced we are238 sincere in all our professions to him, that he will grant every thing we can desire, but at present he would grant no more, and by any longer delay in accepting his terms, I am convinced we should not have got even this, T do think Gentlemen that as soon as he finds we are in earnest on his side, that will really be the case, however we have nothing now left but to try, every means have been used to compleat the whole before we took that step in his favor, and I am convinced that if I had not accepted his present proposals that he would have closed in with the Shaiks proposals offers of the Shaiks, and our service have been entirely overset, and I considered by the tenor of the Hon'ble the President and Council command we could not even have attacked Shaik Abdullah's vessels when in the Vackeel's service, I shall be very happy if you approve my conduct, what I looked upon as the true interest of my Honorable Employers, has been my only guide and if you were acquainted Gentlemen with the numberless difficulties daily flung in my way, the recital of the greatest part of which would be tedious and unneces sary, and at the same time the very different disposition the Vackeel was in with respect to this service now, to what he was last year, I believe you would approve my conduct. It now rests with you Gentlemen, to convince him of the sincerity of our professions to him by a vigorous exertion of the force we now have in the service he has requested, and as soon as he finds that to be the case he has often and earnestly declared he will give us satisfaction on his part. With respect to Shaik Abdullah the Vackeel from time of my first arrival till now has not requested our assistance against him, or indeed mentioned him to me; I have said nothing to him respecting our demand on him, as I looked upon it as answering no end till the service of Carrack was near over and I judged it might then be done with better success. This packet proceeds by the way of Doorack in Company with the persons who carry the Vackeel's order to the Chaub, so that at the time this reaches you, you may depend Gentlemen the Chaub has received the same, by which our vessels will I suppose have no occasion to be detained longer on that station, but will be able all to proceed on the intended service. The Honourable Companys present to the Vackeel as last year declined accepting till affairs were brought to a conclusion and that being now done I requested his acceptance of it, which he readily agreed to, and it was accord ingly yesterday presented to him and he expressed himself greatly pleased and satisfyed therewith and requested in the evening to see me, and on waiting on him he assured me in the strongest manner, and requested I would on his part assure you that as soon as ever he found, we had vigourously commenced hostilities against the Meer, by which blood had been spilt which would con vince him we were in earnest in his cause that he would send any number of troops necessary to bring it to a speedy issue, and at the same time he requested that encouragement might be given to any persons that would willingly desert from the Meer, and they might be assured of being received by him favourably and that such persons might be sent to Bushire in order to be sent hither also all prisoners taken to be delivered at Bushire to be sent hither. I believe you may depend Gentlemen on a force from this as soon as ever we have struck a blow against the Meer such as taking bisGanivafs, Battering or Bombarding his fort, or some other signal service. The pacifick scheme you were pleased to propose I have not mentioned to the Vackeel I looked upon it as most proper to come from the Meer239 therefore if you will please to order it to be proposed to him, when wour force is before Carrack, and he agrees to your terms, with the proviso of his coming to Shirass in person, and give directions to send me advice of it, I believe no great difficulty will be found to gain the Vackeel's consent to spare his life at our intercession, the Vackeel is far from being of a cruel disposition, it is no more than what he has done to several persons who have stood out against him. The four field pieces taken by the Chaub, the Vackeel will send an order to be delivered on board our ships when before Carrack, as to this hour he is not fully convinced we shall undertake this service—the prisoners taken by the Chaub he has ordered to be released. The Vackeel also again assured me, we should be fully satisfied with him, as soon as ever he found me really intended to give him the proof of our friendship I had promised him, and as an excuse for the suspicions he still entertained, he desired I might not be surprized thereat for he had been once before promised assistance, though when it came to the proof he was dis appointed of it, but he hoped it would be different now, which I assured him he should be soon convinced of. I am. Gentlemen, very respectfully Your most obed« servant, GEORGE SKIPP. S hirass, The 16*} April 1768. CLXVL Translate of the Vackeers obligations and grant of the Island of Carrack, delivered 14* April 1768. The Supreme order is—By reason that at this time the most honorable and most noble amongst the Christians George Skipp, Ambassador, in behalf of the most renowned and most powerful Kingdom and Company of England, sent by the most high and most renowned General Beglerbege of Bombay, Governor of the English territories in India, and by the mediation of the most respectable Bahous of the English Company residing at Bussora is now at our magnificent Court, which is protected of the Almighty. You have declared unto us the whole of the dispute for the recovery of the goods from the Hon'ble Shaik Soleman Chaub, the whole of which you have fully proved before our Council, and we have found and examined you have good reason to make the demand, and on account of the friendship which has always subsisted between the Vackeel of Persia, the Kings of Persia, and the Kings of England, and as it clearly appears to us that this Honorable Shaik Soleman got possession of a considerable quantity of goods the property of Persons belonging to the English Company, and afterwards fled from Turkey, and became a subject of Persia; we see it necessary on account of the friend ship so long subsisting to give satisfaction, and fill up the amount taken by him, and as you promised that whatever service by sea you could do you would undertake, after much discourse we on both sides agreed, that all the ships of the English Company at Bussora or Bushire shall go against the island of Carrack and that you will stay before my greatness that you240 will take this island, and with regard to this Pirate Manna who is a Pirate fled from our Kingdom and got possession of the island of Carrack, jf it ; s possible you will bring him, or if lie should be killed in the war, either his head or some sign of him you will bring. On this account we of our Greatness promise that after the English have rendered us this serrioe, and have taken Carraok, that you have brought hither Manna, or some sign of him or at least you have broke his force the sum of 15,000 Tomaunds Tabriz Kaige Em, we hereby oblige ourselves, and promise to get from Shaik Soliman and pay you for the damage and loss you received from Shaik Soliman we also promise the half of all the Merchandize and Goods of Manna to the English Company, which with the whole of the Guns and appurtenances of War belonging thereto, all warlike stores, also the boats and Ganivats we give to them; we promise and make over the Island of Carrack to the English Company for their Defence against their enemies, to live there, and follow whatever business they please with full liberty—and we do hereby grant the entire possession and Dominion of this island to the English Company for ever, that they may stay there and act asjt seemeth best unto them. We also promise if from this time forward either by sea or land Sheik Boliman shall take or molest any Boats or vessels or in any shape molest anv persons belonging to the English, we hereby oblige ourselves to give full satisfaction for the same, and make good the whole of the loss occasioned bv .him. J As long as your war shall subsist with Manna we are obliged and will send all manner of provisions for your forces. It is necessary that mGeorge Skipp for his security shall keep this irmaund by him, that after the service which he has promised is completed he may show the same, and demand every thing agreeable to what is wrote therein.

In the evening another Council of war was called composed as the former for renewing the attack again in the morning, if the weather would permit of ^ ^ was un animously agreed, that in consequence of Skipp's communica tion to the Eactors at Bushire dated the 8^ instant it seemed adviseable to defer another attempt, untill we should be certain whether the Caun would really send any troops to our assistance or not, which should he still not do after hostilities are commenced, we will then renew the attack by ourselves. Having the Caun's troops would in a manner insure us success whereas at present it is rather doubtful—should a breach be made and even stormed, it is a matter of great doubt whether we could maintain it afterwards with our small numbers, and if we should meet with a repulse either with the ships or in landing our troops it may in all probability ruin our Hon'ble Employers affairs here in the Gulph for the present. You will please to favor us as soon as possible with your opinion of our resolution, and beg you will duely consider our reason for not renewing the attack. The three Ganivats we mentioned to you on our last belonging to the Meer are not yet returned. We shall use our utmost endeavours to prevent their getting in. As we have a number of sick ann wounded in the fleet, we think it necessary to send them to Bushire and there to have an hospital, under the direction of Mi George Birch. The Bombay Grab will be sent down as soon as the Surgeons think the people with stumps can be moved with safety. We have the pleasure to acquaint you that every person under our com mand did their duty with great spirit. We have the honour to be with Respect, Gentlemen, Your most obedt servt'-, CHARLES ELPHINSTONE. LAWRENCE NILSON. S hip R evenge, The 21*4 May 1768. GLXXVIII. C haklbs B lphinstonb &amp; L awrence N ilson to H eney M ooeb, Esq!?, Agent, etca, Council at Bussora. Gbntelmen, By the Albion we expected we expected to have acquainted you with our Disaster at corgo. success in burning three of the Meer's Ganivats, which we attempted this morning between three and four O'Olock, with our boats manned and armed, under the command of Lieutenants Lutton, Sheriff, Scot, and Blair, but they 2578 f. d. Awere not able to accomplish tlie design, tbe boats grounding and the Ganiva ts being too far hauled upon the beach to attempt it with any possibility o f success and were obliged to return. At the same time the Meer had formed a scheme upon us which we are sorry to inform you he was too fortunate in. The Eagle, Wolf and Storeship being in want water, on the 27t h ordered them to Congo, as we were afraid if we sent the storeship to Bushire she would not be able to join us in a long time, we gave the necessary orders to the Commander not to land if they saw any people upon the island, they therefore before they sent their casks on shore examined it closely and found no body upon it; but for fear of a surprize we ordered on shore, one Subedar, and fifty Seapoys to cover the people employed in watering with orders to them to embark every night at sun set, which was duely complied with. Yesterday Captains Nelson and Biggs went on shore walked all over it, and saw not the least appearance of people, but it seems in the night the Meer had sent over forty or fifty men in small boats who hid them selves in trenches in the sand; they this morning suffered the waterers, and the guard of seapoys to land, and about an hour and half afterwards the Enemy all at once rushed out from their place of concealment, which we are sorry to inform you threw the Guard of Seapoys in confusion and most of them threw their arms from them and run into the water—the few that stood to their arms were all out to pieces, to the number of twelve and six wounded— M r Field having but few Lascars had sent four of his Europeans to fill his casks, two of them were cut to pieces, and the other two are taken prisoners. As soon as we observed their fire on shore we embarked all the troops into boats from the Revenge and Bombay Grab to their assistance, and the Eagle and Wolf kept a constant fire upon the enemy, upon which they embarked in some small boats which we imagine had landed them in the night made the Bombay Grab, and Eancy Signal to endeavour to cut them off, before they reached Carrack, but there being little or no wind they were not able to effect it. We finding it unnecessary for the troops to land; all the people being got on board but them that was killed ordered them to their respective ships. By this Gentlemen you will see that we have a bold and daring enemy to do with, who will take all manner of advantages, and whose troops are excellently disciplined. He has since our first arrival here made many great improve ments in his fortifications, which greatly surprizes them that are judges of it, and so far are his people from being disaffected to him that they seem quite the contrary. We had letters from the Gentlemen at Bushire this day; they inclosed copy of a letter from M r - Skipp dated the 19^ instant, by which he in a manner tells us that the Caun will find some new excuse for not sending his troops agreeable to his promises; if so we can only regret our Honorable Employers state of affairs in this Gulph, as we have by no manner of means a sufficient number to make the landing by ourselves especially as the heats are now set in. As the water is extremely bad at Congo and the Meer no more to be trusted, we are obliged to dispatch the Eancy, Wolf and Storeship to Bushire for water, firewood and the wounded Seapoys, the Eagle we dispatch with the Albion over Bussora bar to fill up her water and then to join us, if she does not receive other orders from you, as we have ordered Captain W. Menlie to send up his boat to acquaint you of his being in the river.Qj 243 We have very little jnore than two mouths salt provisions on board the fleet, which will soon be expended as we cannot be supplied from Bushire with sufficient fresh meat. The two schooners dispatched with the Experiment are not vet arrived we are in hourly expectation of seeing them.

Having particular occasion to make several observations on your pastiotheGnlf. and to give some directions for your future conduct in the management of the Companys affairs in the Persian Gulph we now transmit them to you by an overland Conveyance. 2. The several letters from your settlement which you transmitted to us over the Desart in the course of the past year, were dated as follows, and received at the undermentioned periods, viz.— Letter of the 9^ February 1767 received 9 th May 1767. 2l 8t March . . 9 1lh June 9 th April . . 14 th July ^ 29^ June . , 25S 1 of September 16 th July , . 24^,, October S 411 August . . do. do. 12 th September the 26 lh December. 13^ do. . . do. 5 tl1 October . , ll 01 January 1768 15!?

We observe with great concern that the Forces sent before had not been able to effect one single object for their interest on Credit, on the Contrary to judge from the present appearance, will be attended with a con siderable expence to us, and embroil their affairs in every part of the Gulph, owing in a great measure to want of knowledge and experience in those who have transacted this disagreeable undertaking which we shall point out in the followiing part of this letter.24,4, Expedition against 4. The first mistaken step was in the year 1706 when our forces joined the Turks to go against the Chauh on shore ; they landed in a very bad wet place, when the Men had great difficulty to march, and which was too great a distance from the place to be attacked, and consequently very difficult to brins? up the Artillery. The next step was attacking the Port before the Turks had joined; who certainly from their numbers should have begun the attack, and been assisted by our Force; this not being the case we were most shamefully beat and lost many of our people. Karim Khan. By your former advices it appears that soon after this Carim Caun becomes Protector to the Chaub claims him as his subject and forbids our joining the Turks to go against him, and at the same time pretends an inclination to accommodate matters between us and the Chaub ; but in the course of treating on this subject, he shews himself clearly to have no design for our interest; M?; Skipp goes to him in a public character at his own desire ; is treated very indifferently not suffered to appear before him, besides many other slights, when Skipp had orders to come away, he is then somewhat more com plaisant leaves the treaty about the Chaub and desires our assistance against the Arabs, and at last be says he will give us five lacks of Bupees for losses we sustained by the Chaub's captures, he at the same time desires Assistance to take Ormuse. 6. 'We are much surprized to find that our servants were not sensible of the ill-treatment we have received from Carim Caun on every occasion, more particularly in that one of our trade at Bushire, which he has obstructed all in his power for some time past, and at last to convince all the world of his bad inclinations to us, he prohibits the merchants carrying any ready money there, and orders what they buy there must be paid for by way of barter in goods the produce of Persia which he knew was impossible for us to comply with, the above and the unsettled state of Bushire itself owing in some measure to a dispute between the Governor of that place and the Caun who threatned every day to send an army against him, the consequence of which would most probably be the loss of our effects there. These are such striking circumstances that our Agent and Council ought immediately to have withdrawn our servants and effects from thence when they would have been independent of the Caun, and if he had wanted to treat, must have then sent people to you for that purpose—another great advantage would have acrued from this step. The Chaub would have been convinced that the Caun had no longer any influence over ns, nor could he do us any harm. You might have attacked the Chaub in any manner you chose or joined other power against the Caun, or suffered Meer Mahanna to attack him in any place that he might chuse. Expedition against 7. We shall consider the expedition you have engaged into Ormuse Ormnx. fa reC0 ver the plundered effects taken from the Islamabad by the Shaik of that place. We have observed that the Caun promised to give you five lacks of Rupees on the Chaubs account, and you were to assist him to take Ormuse, where he expects a great deal of plunder—there does not appear any written agreement between you and the Caun before the ships were ordered to go to Ormuse and yet you say the Caun is to have half the plunder, to be delivered at Bushire, and express your apprehensions that disputes may arise between you in case the Forces should be successful about the amount, which if it be short of his expectation he will imagine we have taken more than our share, this will undoubtedly be the case if you was to send even so much. You seem at last to reconcile this intricate affair to yourselves by saying that245 ' surely he cannot be a man so void of Honor to think that we defraud him,' upon the whole the expedition to Ormuse appears a most imprudent and indiscreet action, and if attended with success must embroil us with the Caun in such a manner as never to be ended unless our servants and effects are with drawn from Bushire before the ships return from Ormuse. 8. In your letter under date of the 15- November you mention a resolu- Passes tion you have taken and put into execution of giving passes under the Companys seal to the vessels and boats trading in the Gulph for which they pay one hundred Rupees yearly, in order to protect them from being plundered by the several Arab Shaiks: this may be very well for them, but with re«pect to your Employers it appears to be a very destructive and unwarrantable measure; for though Meer Mahanna now says he shall have regard to the passes. You may judge he will not long remain in that disposition, as the consequence would be fatal to him, his principal dependence being the plunder he is to get from those very people whom you wish to protect, besides he is only one of many others lower in the Gulph who follow the same trade, and will now be more induced to do it than ever, seeing the bad success we have had with our forces at Bussorah, which is the first time they have known such an instance. You must expect constant complaints that no regard has been paid to the passes which you have no power to redress, unless the fleet was kept whole year in the Gulph; besides this we must then be in a general state of war with all the Arabs, and if no notice is taken of the insult our credit is lost. Upon the whole it appears these most extraordinary transaction that could have occurred to you, and executed without any orders from your superiors. 9. There is another circumstance that appears very extraordinary, when you resolve to send the fleet to Ormuse you say it is designed to take the place for Oarim Caun, but you afterwards hear that he is much displeased at this measure and declares the Shaik of that place to be his subject, and on that account must not be touched, from whence it appears you cannot have settled any plan with him ; In short, if you had met to consider of a mode to embroil our affairs, it is very doubtful if you could have done it so compleatly as by the measures you have now taken. 10. 'We do not find that you have any power from the President and Council to send a force against Ormuse the general orders for endeavouring to recover the effects plundered from the Islamabads cannot be deemed so. And the you say that this was a favourable opportunity having no immediate want of the fleet at Bussorah, we are not of that opinion for you might very reason ably expect orders from the Presidency for your guidance before Christmass, bv which time the fleet could not possibly return from Ormuse and in the way attack the island of Kist which was part of the orders. If it should so happen, orders from the Presidency cannot be executed untill the fleet returns the consequence of which at that time of the year must be very prejudicial. 11 The orders you gave to our con tenant servants to take one lack of Rupees for our Expences, Eorty thousand for the captors, and three or four lacks for the owners of the Islamabad appears very well upon paper, but no stipulation having been made with Carim Caun on this account, you may be assured he will not allow it, nor can it be supposed that the Shaik of Ormuse is possessed of such sums of Money, but if it should be so, you may be assured he is provided with such a number of Forces, as to prevent your doing any thing against him, with the small one you have sent.246 M eer Mohanna. 12. The Court disapproved of your attacking Meer Mahanna, or taking possession of Carrack, or even residing upon the island sup posing Meer Mahanna •would admit of it, judging it very improper that our effects and servants should be under the protection of a Man who is a publick Robber, his present situa tion at the entrance of Bussorah river makes it necessary for us to keep on good terms with him, as otherwise many of the small vessels trading from the different settlements in India belonging to our servants and Inhabitants might be molested by him, and we now positively order that you do not attack him unless he begins, which there is no reason to think he will find it his interest to do, or that you receive positive orders from our President and Council for doing it. 13. We have been allways apprehensive that our settlement at Bushire might be attended with many disagreeable circumstances, if our servants were not very attentive not to keep to any large amount of our effects there which we have signified in many of our letters, to which we hope due regard has been paid, 14. The uncertainty and Eisk in procuring Gilan Silks appear to us too great to expect any success from the orders we have before given, and have laid aside any thought of it for the present. 15. We shall now make some observations of your transactions at Bussora, which appear in your last letter. 16. The Court were sorry to observe that the Turks have not kept up ^ir stipulated payments for the expence of the fleet which induced you very properly to apply to the Mussaleem and inform him that if the balance was not paid you should be obliged to send away the fleet, his a nswer gives us little * hopes of his complying, as he seems to think we have already had what we ought to deem fully sufficient, we still hope we shall recover all, but if it happens otherwise we shall lose a large sum of money, the lives of many people, besides wear and tear of our vessels, etca, and the worst of all the Honor and reputation of the nation, and we are sorry to say principally owing to the .ndiscretion and b ad management of our Servants. ***** « Courts order#. 22. Upon the whole from the best judgment we can form, we totally dis approved of our system of Politicks particularly with regard to Oarim Caun and the Expedition to Ormuse. We think you should by no means quarrel with Meer Mahanna, for the Reasons given in the foregoing part of this jetter; as long as he sees you are upon that plan you will allways have some weight with him; when you complain of injuries the trade of Bussora may receive by his depredation. If the news you have heard proves true that some Dutch ships were arrived at Gombroon, it may probably be to attack him, if so, they will either destroy him, or put him into a Situation to be no more troublesome, we are persuaded that when our servants and effects are withdrawn from Bushire, our affairs will be conducted with much more case and security than at present. It will be proper for you to keep on good terms with the Bussora Government, but we cannot think of keeping the present force there unless they will pay the expence of it, or at least the much greater part of it, this you must represent to them in the strongest manner; you must avoid if possible going upon any expedition on shore, jointly with their forces or by any other in the Gulph, for you may be assured they will leave the whole work to be done by our Porces, besides great Inconveniences from their delays, in short avoid any alliance with the Arabs ^ otherwise than to be on Eriendship ; but in case of any difference tha,t eithe247 / ay have with other powers, each is to defend himself, the Chauh being so near and pow erful an enemy to Bussora, seems to be at present the principal object; on that account as well as to recover satisfaction of him for the Losses we have sustained. We suppose you have represented the affair very fully to our President and Council of Bombay, and that you have long before now received their orders. Always remember that the Premisses or even writings of Persians or Arabs will be no longer Validity, than their interest coincedes with them. We are, Your loving friends, THOMS ROUS, &amp;ci.

Our last respects were dated the 26th August, were conveyed to Bushire by the Madras Merchant, and thence to Bombay by the Bombay Grab the duplicate of them, in case of failure of the Original, you will find in the ship to ship Diary now transmitted your Honour, &amp;Cr., by the Nancy Snow Captain Price. 2. The transmitting our Diary and General Books by this conveyance Skipps^ alleged and the sickly season with which we are contending, we hope will sufficiently exculpate us for the brevity of this address—In our Diary under the 24^ instant is a letter to our Hon'ble Employers, which comprises the whole of the occurrences of this Agency to that date, to which we humbly beg leave to refer— ^hat letter however has recourse to sundry papers relative to Mr. Skipp's con duct as late Warehousekeeper and Accomptant at Bussora, which papers are also particularly entered in the Diary; on ^his account we think it unnecessary the sending you another copy of them. 3. In duty to our Hon'ble Employers we have suspended Mr. Skipp the Hon'ble Company's service, for breach of trust and breach of orders; at his own request therefore he now proceeds to Bombay on the Nancy, in order to clear his conduct to your Honour, &amp;c^, this he informs us he hopes to do to your satisfaction : his Account Current with the Hon'ble Company is now enclosed, he has requested to settle it with yon ; we have readily consented, as the Hon'ble Company we fear will be very considerably indebted to him on account his 2i Schiras Embassy; this account it would be rather inconve nient to him to adjust at Bussora. Under the 27th instant you will observe his reasons for not signing the Abstract Charges to our General Books an affair much too immaterial to be insisted on by us ; the Agents remarks thereon are in the same Consultation. 4. Though our Diary now transmitted, may in fact be considered a full letter Fa ^ 1 ? r I e io ° f of all occurrences at Bussora since the H August to this date, of course since Kian's tro op» , ■» j-j i. march to uomma. our last to you, your Honour &amp;Cr., might perhaps be displeased did we not, like heads to chapters, just touch upon those occurrences ; this therefore we shall now do. The Sehiras negotiation brake up, Mr. Skipp under the 3i October returned, and the Caun's troops marched to Genova ; notwithstanding this, w © are firm in opinion not a man will ever leave the Continent, and that the marc h. is only calculated to deceive; at the same time to deceive as irreproachably as U ^ I248 possible, and to throw on us the failure of the negotiation. Under the 6th September we came to the resolution of having nothing further to do with the Caun, bis perfidious and injurious treatment of us, the causes of it. Our risque at Bushire reduced to 5,000 Hupees and Mr. Morley and Mr. Beaumont at that settlement—Mr. Green at Bussora. The Squadron made two divisions of, and constantly moving between Verdistan and Bussora. The Speedwell Snow from Bengal, commanded by Captain Gardiner, taken by Meer Mahanna of Bushire Fort under the 17th August; the particulars of which appear from Captain Gardiners narrative entered under the 15^ Sep tember and the Consultation thereon under the 16^. The K»»b The Chaub building forts on each side of river, and the Turks in no capacity to check him;—what this will end in we cannot pretend to determine, we sub mit it however to your consideration—under the 4th instant we came to the resolution of committing no hostilities against the Ohaub for the reasons then set forth—inprudence however we now intend detaining one-half of the squadron always at Bussora. The Turkish debt. The Booralties on account the balance due from the Bacha for the main tenance of the fleet not recovered ; but the Government debted for them amount ing to Tomaunds 2,050, CojaShaada, Coja Yacob and Coja Ilias their booralties on account the remaining woolens accepted ; better than an half of the remains assigned over to them, and the whole to be delivered on their recovery ; the cash accounts will shew the amount of cash received on this account—we have further agreed ^ith them, that if the amount of their booralties exceed one- half of the amount remains of Shaada's contracts, the surplus will be received in half payment for our remaining Tabbies, Sattins Durants, &amp;Cr., provided they pay the other half in ready cash @ 6,76 ^ Rupees as our Hon'ble Employer have directed us to sell these articles, for what they will fefcch.

The foregoing Hon'ble Sir and Sirs are the capital points now submitted to your consideration, in the Diary now transmitted; the Index, being a very full and particular one, will immediately direct you to the several matters you wish to be informed of, and it is with the utmost impatience that we shall wai^ for your reply to them. (?. We are not without hopes but your Honour, &amp;ci, may have indulged us before this with your orders and intentions, as to our conduct; the melancholy accounts we transmitted you of our situation, by the Adriana, Armusur si249 Experiment, and Grab, induce us to think we must hear from you; we have long despaired of every assistance from the Caun and sorry indeed should we beif your Honour, cfcc-, have depended on any; whatever CWeyance may have been sent with your orders, or whatever may be sent with them, we hope the Conveyance is a respectable one, or the Meer's Galivats we fear may interrupt hert we have lodged a letter at Muscat to inform all the Commanders coming up the Gulph, of the risque they are to run from the Meer's Galivats. 7. We have not received any letters from our Hon'ble Employers since our last to your Honour, &amp;c * except it be a triplicate of their commands of the 2nd March; f orwarded from gleppo the Q[h September} ^ recei7ed h the 18^ instant. 8. The Eagle, Fancy and Dolphin now give convoy to the Nancy as far as Bushire, from whence she will be conveyed untill Captain Farmer thinks there is no further resque from the Meer's Galivats; if the Galivats are not at Carrack, of course the Convoy will proceed beyond Verdistan. 9. No money has as yet been paid in on account the Government's or our own Customs for the sales of the Bengal Barconnah, or the Nancy's Mocha Coffee, Cargoe; a great part of the former however we hear are sold, and the whole of the latter; shortly we therefore doubt not of receiving their respective amounts, and we flatter ourselves also with some share of the Governments Customs on the Muscat Coffee fleet now here. 10. The alotment of our business and causes for its backwardness are now submitted to your Honour, &amp;ci; 's, consideration, in our Diary under the 28 fch instant, we will do all we can to bring it up, but health in this inclement season is too precarious to fix any particular period for it. 11. Inclosed we forward the necessary accounts of our Settlement, and our Quick Stock to the day : as before observed, Mr. Skipp's Account Current with the Hon'ble Company is also enclosed. 12. We once more hope your Honour, &amp;ot, will forgive us for not beinc more particular in this letter; but had we health and time (as we transmit our Diary) it would in our opinions be needless—in that light we flatter ourselves your Honour, &amp;c t, will consider it. 13. As we think it of importance our Hon'ble Employers being acquainted with the tenor of our last letter to them of the 24th instant; we despatch a duplicate of it in a few days, accompanied by its several relatives. Where with respect, H'NBLE SIR &amp; SIRS, Your obedient humble servants. B ussoea; TJie 30th October 1786. CLXXXL James Morley, Resident at Bushire, to the Presidency. H onoukable S ir and S irs, I now despatch this letter to Congoon to be forwarded from thence to your honour and by the way of Muscat, in order to advice you of a revolution which has lately happened on Carrack of my proceedings in consequence thereof. Freight of The Meer having confined one Durbass, a person of the greatest note in his KaS service, and treated him with' the utmost severity for some trivial offence, the heads of the most considerable tribes of Arabs on the Island were so much alarmed at this proceeding as to apprehend themselves in a very dangerous250 situation from the Meer's cruel disposition and therefore entered into a conspiracy to destroy him. In order thereto they seized the small Eort on the 26th ultimo at night before the Meer had any intimation of their design and then drew up a body of troops to seize his person, which was immediately- attempted ; but those who altered him opposing the conspirators gave him an opportunity of escaping to one of the bastions of the large Port where for a little time he proposed making a defence, in hopes he would shortly be so much reinforced as to enable him to retrieve his affairs, but being disappointed in this particular he determined at length to take himself to flight and immediately left Carrack in a small boat, with about 20 men who still adhered to him. The Present Governors of Carrack are Durbass and Hassan Sagadeen by whose invitation two persons have been sent to Oarrack by Zaiky Caun and are now taking an account of the effects that are remaining. It occurred to me on the receipt of these advices that as the Honourable Company have been at great expense on account the Meer, and many of the English have suffered very considerably by his depredations, the Agent and Council would probably make a demand of restitution from the Caun for those losses and perhaps endeavour to force him to a compliance therewith by keep ing a fleet off Carrack to obstruct the removal of any considerable part of the effects he acquired. To prevent, therefore, any obstacle to our these measures, I judged it would be highly necessary immediately to withdraw this settlement and determined accordingly—lest the Caun should entertain any suspicion of our having such an Intention (which seemed very probable from the opinion of the Sheik and the People of Bushire in general, and in consequence thereof give order to the Sheik to make a seizure of our persons and effects with a view of having some security that our future conduct should be no way detrimental to his interest. On coming to this resolution I sent for the Sheik and informed him that the Eagle (which arrived here from Bussora the same day) brought me orders from the Agency to repair thither as soon as possible, and that agreeable thereto I should leave Bushire very shortly. This for a long while he endeavoured to dissuade me from, advising me to wait for further advices from the Agency whose Eesolutions, he said might possibly change on having the news of what has happened on Carrack. But finding that I pleaded a necessity of paying a strict obedience to my orders he then informed me should it be attended with any ill consequences to the Caun, he would pay very severely; for he had just received, an order from Zackey Caun not to permit of our going from hence till he had advices from Sheraz how to act regarding us, imagining our fleet might be employed against Carrack. As to the particular I expressed myself much surprised that Zackey Caun should entertain any such apprehension and represent to him that as the Meer was a notorious robber, whose destruction was necessary for our trade that was the Hon'ble Company's motive in determining to reduce him, but that in my opinion they would no longer concern themselves about Carrack since it has been delivered to the Caun for whom he had the highest respect. This representation had so favourable an effect at that time that he made no farther objection to my removal which flattered me with the hopes he would not impede it. Bat some of the Hospital people getting some of the Country Boats soon after, in order to proceed on board the Cruizer I had the Concern to hear the Sheik had set a guard near the Eactory not to allow them to put off nor to carry away any of our .effects^v 251 in consequence of which I again sent to the Sheik desiring to see him. On his second visit he said it gave him the greatest uneasiness to have received the late orders from Zaky Oaun which laid him under the absolute necessity of detaining me, for unless ^they were punctually obeyed his father must inevit ably fall a sacrifice to the Caun's resentment but that the Messenger whom Zakey Caun had sent to Schyras with advices of the late transactions in Carrack would soon return and he was certain would bring him orders not to molest us observing that as this was the case it was extremely cruel my desiring to bring him into disgrace with the Caun, after discovering in this manner for sometime he swore most solemnly that if I would so far oblige him as to wait till the arrival of the said messenger or till the 11th Instant at farthest, he would no longer prevent my departure thro' the Caun should give him the positive orders to the contrary and our effects in the interim be sent on board the vessels. Finding him determined in the Eesolution he had taken, I considered it would be altogether impracticable to carry off the people we had on shore, the number of which together with those in the Hospital would amount to one hundred, should I refuse complying with his request and that when the greatest Part of these were on board it might be possible to get off the rest by a sudden flight, if the Sheik seemed any way inclined to a breach of his promise; therefore on his repeating his oath he had before taken, £ consented to act agreeable to his desire In this situation I am now preparing for my departure and flatter mysplf Resident prepare« your Honour, etc., will approve of the measures I have taken having acted from t0 ]eaVe ' a regard to the interest of my Honorable Employers, with which I must like wise beg leave to observe the Continuance of this settlement would in my opinion be no way consistent considering the treatment we have lately reed, from Sheik Nassir which your Honor etc., will be informed by the enclosed copy of a letter I addressed to the Agent and Council under the 1st Instant. As to the shipping that may shortly be expected here from India, I shall lodge letter at Congoon and Muscat advising them of their settlement being withdrawn that they may regulate their conduct accordingly. I am with the greatest respect, Hon'ble Sir, and Sirs, Your most obedient Humble Servant, (Sd.) JAMES MORLEY. Bushire, 4th Fehrmry 1769. CLXXXII. Bombay Castle, 22nd March 1769. Wednesday 2-2nd Bushire letter to. The Expedition Grab being on the point of sailing and the above letter sent Bushire Residents' round to the several Members, an answer to it was immediately drawn up, and demned 11 ^ C011 ' signed^wherein We acknowledged Receipt of it, and expressed our surprize at his252 supposing the Agent and Council would take such an extraordinary Step as he endeavours to force Oarem Caun to make restitution for the losses.—We had sus tained by the Meer, as it would infallibly occassion a rupture with the Caun, which in the present situation of affairs would be totally inconsistent with our Hon'ble employers' interest, that as the Island was voluntarily surrendered to the Caun, We certainly could have no Right to relinquish to us any part of the effects he might obtain there as a compensation for our losses, tho' If he could be brought to make good to proper and suitable remonstrances, it would afford us great pleasure, and that these being our sentiments, we could not but highly disapprove of his conduct in attempting to withdraw from Bushire on the bare surmise that the Agency would pursue an unwarrantable measure and intimated our wishes that this letter might reach him in time to prevent his carrying his intentions into Execution. CLXXXIII. Various intentions of Sheikh of Karrack about the island. Karim Khan's precautions for securing Earrack wealth. Agent and Council at Basrah to the Presidency. Hon'blb Sir and Sirs, Various are the accounts which we have received concerning the inten tions of the Caun and Carrackers relative to the Island of Carrack ; and Meer Hussain Sultan, the Sheik of the Island, seems to be wavering between his fear of the Caun and his desire of keeping possession of Carrack and its riches. Some reports say that his people are much disaffected to His Government and are daily leaving the Island, that he intends delivering the effects to the Caun, and that they are to be equally divided between the Meer and the Caun and the Persian Army; others that he is very desirous of our settling on the Island where he would give us a Pactory, but not the fort as he first proposed and others again say that the Meer has wrote to the Imaum of Muscat requesting his friendship, and promising to deliver over the effects and gallivats of the Island if he will grant him his protection and admit of his and his followers living unmolestedly at Muscat. Carem Caun either in consequence of a promise from the Meer of the de livery of the Island and its effects or in order to prevent the Meer's proposal to the Imaum from being carried into execution, has ordered the Chaub to send down his Fleet to Geneva, in order to join the Bushire one—The former consist ing of 10 Gallivats and two boats with about 250 in one and 70 or 80 in the rest was met on Monday last at the Mouth of our river, by a Boat coming up from Bushire, and the latter consisting of a small ship, 4 gallivats and about 30 armed Boats, was getting ready at Bushire when the abovementioned Boat left that Place. With these Fleets it is said the Caun intends to force the Meer to a com pliance with his demands, or together with the Carrack Fleet also, to attack our Squadron in case it should endeavour to prevent them from carrying the Carrack riches over to the Continent. In our opinions the veracity of the above reports is much to be doubted to us it does not seem probable that the Chaub will ever venture with his Fleet as far as Geneva, but there is reason to think that his Intention is only to make a shew of Compliance to the Caun's orders, and that in a short time we shall hear of his return to Doorack. Admitting however that the Chaub's obedience to. the Caun is an unfeigned one, we cannot think our keeping our small Fleet, of Carrack, can at present253 answer any good end. Experience has convinced us that it is not in the power of Br d itis ^ Jj eet th our cruizers to prevent the communication between the Carrack and the Continent, gulf. The present tempestuous season, their crippled condition with regard to cables and the junction of the Cam^s, Chaub's and Meer's fleet would render their situation off Carrack a very dangerous one. To molest the Chaub's Fleet too at this junction we think would be very impolitick, not only because it would be impossible to check him effectually, but because if we again commence hostilities with him our Commerce will unavoidably feel the bad consequences of it. For these reasons, we have directed Captain Farmer of the Revenge, which now gives convoy to the Berkshire down the Gulph : to order up the other division of the Squadron to Bussora and not to aid offensively either against the Caun, Chaub, or Meer, unless a favourable opportunity offers, whereby if he thinks he can get possession or destroy the gallivats of both or either of the latter powers, if he can he is by all means to attempt it. He is further directed to give convoy to the Berkshire below Bushire, in case the Carrack Gallivats are out, or further, if he has reason for thinking they are to the Southward of Bushire, the Revenge is then to return to Bussora; where we intend to detain her with the remainder of the squadron till we bave from your Honor, etc., unless any merchantship may have occasion of them as a Convoy. Under the 21st ultimo at Midnight Meer Mohanna with one attendant Murder of Meer was strangled by orders from the Pacha; His Head is to be sent to Bagdat, Mollanlla, and from thence we learn to Carem Caun. The Turks, there is reason to imagine were apprehensive the Caun would demand the Meer of them, to give him up would be dishonorable and to refuse him they dare not that, between their policy, their hatred and their fear, have been guilty of this act of barbarity. How great so ever might have been the Meer's crimes, he was not a Turkish subject, and his being powerless and a prisoner ought surely to have entitled him to their humanity and protection. If not that they ought to have given him up to the Caun, and not have stained their honor with his blood. ****** We are, with respect Hon'ble Sir and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble servants, Sd.

Proceedings of Met purposely to take into consideration the several Advices from the Council condemned. -A-gent and Council at Bussorah not hitherto replied to, the whole of which are now read and the following Remarks made aud Reduction taken thereon. Their letters of the 20th December 1767, 8th March, and 21st April 1768 seem from beginning to end to be an attempt to indicate measures, which We had before disapproved, and which We still continue to disapprove notwithstand ing the further Reasons the Agent has thought proper to assign in vindication of them. Withdrawal of fleet The whole of their letters are filled with accounts of the negotiations with assumption. Carem Caun whose Troops the Agent and Council seem to have set it down for certain would not march, and in consequence of this opinion, which has since appeared to be without foundation, returned the vessels, and best part of our force to India, a step we have long ago disapproved, and the event has verified the justness of our opinion for the Oaun's Troops did actually march from Schyrash, and arrived at Geneva a very few days after the vessels sailed for India, but even the march of the troops the Agent and Council seem to think was merely calculated to amuse. We are at a loss to conceive what reason they can have for such an idle supposition, for is it reasonable to imagine the Caun would be at the trouble, and expence of marching so large a body of Troops to such a distance merely with a view to deceive, especially if he is the avai i- tious man they represent him to be when the troops did come down ? It seems very extraordinary indeed that the Agent and Council did not send the remain ing vessels to assist in transporting them to Carrack. Their reasons for which are by no means satisfactory, for tho. we should have been extremely glad had they succeeded in their demand of having fifteen thousand Rupees (15,000) Tomaunds paid at Bussorah, yet at all events, whether we succeeded in procur ing favorable terms from the Caun or not, it would certainly then have been for our Hon'ble Masters' interest to have had Meer Mahana destroyed, who in consequence of the attack upon Carrack was become our avowed and inveterate enemy. Mr. Skipp iji his letter of the 28th August from Schyrash particularly mentions the terms offered by the Caun, which the Caun in a letter from255 himself transmitted at the same time promised to abide by,and which in our opinion is a confirmation of the terms, offered altho. the same are not particularly specified in the Gann's letter. Not withstanding^ this'the Agent and Council repeat their orders to Mr. Skipp for annulling all engagements with the Caun, and retiring from Schyrash, from which unhappy step (which we entirely disapprove) the many advantages we expected to derive from an alliance with the Caun, and the capture of Carrack are not only entirely frustrated, but the Caun highly incensed and our affairs in general in; the Gulph reduced to a worse situation than they were at first. Upon the whole we are of opinion our present disagreeable situation in the Unaccountable Gulph may in a great measure be ascribed to the unaccountable antipathy against^arim 00 ' 9 which the Agent seems to have conceited against Garem Caun, and to the ^inst SkipT 6 measures directed by us not coinciding with his own fantastick sentiments on the subject, and in which we are still further confirmed by a passage in their Diary wherein they expressly say they are daily more and more convinced of the utility which would have attended an alliance with Meer Mahana and this too after knowing the Eon'ble Company's and our sentiments on this very subject were repugnant thereto. Another Cause to which, in oar opinion, the failure of the negotiation at Schyrash may be ascribed is the strange personal pique and disgust which, it obviously appears, the Agent has taken to Mr. Skipp, who was employed thereon 4 founded, as we are led to believe even from the Agent's own Eemarks, on Mr. Skipp's Conduct having met our approbation when he was first employed on this service, tho. introduced by the Agent for a contrary purpose. This approbation he says did not point out Mr. Skipp to him either as an object of bis resentment, or attention. We could never suppose our Applause would expose any one to the former, but it most certainly entitled him to the latter as well as to some degree of favour from Mr. Moore, whose Hemarks therefore we deem the height of disrespect to us and he must be reprimanded for it accordingly^ The Conduct of the Agent has upon the whole been so very extraordinary, and the motives for it so obvious and unwarrantable that we cannot help adding he seems in our Opinion to merit more severe treatment than bare censures or reprimands, but as we hope our lenity in confining ourselves to them alone will prevent his giving us the like cause for them in future, we shall waive for the present saying more on the subject and proceed to consider the other parts of their Advices. Our Letter to Mr. Morley by the Expedition will have shewn the Agent withdrawal of and Council our sentiments m respect to his intentions of withdrawing from Bus}i d ire C not r0m Bushire, which we are sorry to perceive he has since been able to carry into 3 ustlfied ' execution, as we cannot admit the Reasons which he assigns for it to be sufficient, nor do we think the Agent and Council should have attempted to stop the communication between Carrack and the Persian Shore, or set on foot a negotiation with the Islanders, hut at no rate have stipulated for the demolition of the fortifications, and the delivery up of the ordnance, which could not fail to exasperate them, and produce the answer it did. We rather think the nego tiation should have been with Zackey Caun, who in case of finding any difficulty , in getting possession of the Island would most probably in consideration of our assistance have granted us very favourable terms, or allowing he had got quiet possession of it, the Agent and Council might have required that the Caun256 should make good to us our expenses and losses from the depredations of Meer Mahana and the Chaub, the former sustained in consequence of our having upon his account committed hostilities against him and which his getting possession of the Island would amply enable him to do; should He not have got possession when these our Orders reach Bussorah, we would have the Agent and Council endeavour to effect this by offering to assist him on the best conditions they may be able to obtain from him as well in respect to the above as in every other Point -we have already treated on with Him, and should they find it impossible to succeed in this with the Oaun, they must then apply to the Islanders if they are still in Possession, and provided they agree to deliver up their Gallivats to Us, and are in other respects willing to conclude a Treaty of friendship on reputable terms, we would have entered into accordingly, but at all events the Agent and Council are to exert their constant endeavours to prevent Meer Mahana being restored, or invested with any power whatever. We cannot in the present uncertainty we are under as well in respect to Oarrack as the disposition of the Caun towards us, give the Agent and Council more positive orders how to act. Our wishes they know are to have our Hon'ble Masters heavy expences reimbursed, our losses made good, and our commerce in the Gulph established on a firm and secure footing, with the Return of our Vessels. If all or any of these points can be effected in consequence of the late resolution at Carrack it will afford Us unfeigned satisfaction, and we must leave it entirely to the Agent and Council to obtain the best terms they can, provided they are reputable-, from the Caun in preference, but if not from him, from the Islanders as above directed, but they are not to detain the Admiral Watson, or any of the Vessels longer than may be absolutely and indispensibly necessary for carrying into execution any measures they may adopt in consequence of these orders, except the Vessels mentioned in our Letter of the 19th Ultimo, and if they judge it proper they may detain the Fancy instead of the Tyger arrived here since then for the security of the trade, and other purposes, and as the Drahe is best calculated for the Protection of the Vessels bound up the Gulph, we would have Her stationed at Muscat in the months of April and December to give convey to the ships which arrive there in these months from the sides of India bound to Bussorah. As from the Accounts we have hitherto received the attack upon Carrack by our vessels in May last seems to have been improperly conducted, we propose ordering an enquiry to be made into it as soon as the Refcurn of all the officers will admit of its being done effectually. If the wind shifted, and was not favourable for the attack it should certainly have been deferred till another opportunity as the Commanders were not limited to a particular day to make it. ******* If the wife and children of Stephen Hermit continue in indigent circum stances, we acquiesce in the Agent and Council making them such an allowance as in their opinion may be sufficient to afford them a decent maintenance. As they represent the saluting battery to be of no use they must be directed to send back the guns by any of the returning vessels.257 In the 20th Paragraph of their letter of the 21st April speaking of the State of the Business as that settlement when the Agent arrived there, they say ' Dis bursements and Stewards supplies iniquitionsly managed They must be called upon to explain this, and to point out to the iniquitous practices alluded to. We cannot help being of Opinion their expecting or even supposing Mr. Boddam should ask their pardon for not advising them of his being at Muscat, was most absurd and ridiculous, as he was in no shape under their orders, or accountable to them for his proceedings. The Agent and Council should not in our opinion have made Messrs. Beaumont and Levis any extraordinary allowance for their passage without our leave being previously obtained, and in future no more than one hundred (100) Eupees must be allowed on his account, being in proportion to what was for merly allowed to, and from Gombroon. 'We entirely concur with the Agent and Council that the having all goods laden on the Freight ship from Bengal consigned to British subjects would be for our Hon'ble Masters' Interest but we apprehend could it even be effected, that it would involve us in disputes with the Turkish Government who would of course be injured thereby. If the Agent and Council can remove this Difficulty we shall most readily exert every means in our power to get the Goods consigned in the manner they recommend. If a Crew of Mahomedan Lascars can possibly be prevailed upon to remain at Bussorah, we shall agreeable to their Request send a Pattamar Boat thither at the opening of the season and in the meantime acquiese in their hiring a Trankey, or other proper Boat for the Purposes they intend the Herfors. Eeperused the several Depositions and other Papers relative to the Conduct Skipp's conduct, of Mr. George Skipp together with his letter to Us, and the Queries and Answers enclosed therein and the Deposition upon Oath of Signior Eigo (copies of which must be sent to the Agent and Council) and the whole being now taken into deliberation, the following Eemarks are made and Resolutions taken thereon. We are of opinion Mr. Skipp did not employ Eigo as his Agent as surmized by a Shaada, nor do we think any Dependance can be had on the Assertion of this last that Mr. Skipp kept the key of the ware house from him as Mr. Skipp was not at Bussora till almost three months after Mr. Price left it, nor had he charge of the Ware-house till twelve months after his arrival. We are of opinion Mr. Skipp did not influence Mr. Wrench in the sale of the Shalloons but at the same time think He acted wrong, and did not do his Duty to his Employers in not disapproving of this Transaction, more especially as by his afterwards receiving a Part of the Profits arising thereon it is reasonable to conclude he knew they would fetch more. The Affair of the Cloth does not appear to Us in the same bad light, for as it was sold by Contract many years before, our Hon'ble Masters were in fact no sufferers, but still notwithstand ing it was the means of so much Cloth being realized sooner than it otherwise would have been, we think Mr. Skipp would have acted more prudently, and more consistent with bis Duty as a Company's servant if he had not been con cerned in this Transaction. Upon the Whole we approve of the Agent and Council having suspended him under the circumstances proved against him but at the same time highly condemn them for having done it before they gave him an Opportunity of vindicating his conduct, which appears to us to have been rather an error in Judgment than any real Intention of injuring his Employers, and as he has given258 us perfect satisfaction in his negociations at Schurasli, and in every respect since he has been in the service, it is unanimously agreed to take off his sus pension and restore him to his standing but he must be required to make good the difference on the price of the Shalloons and the amount of Mr. Lyster's debt to the ware-house, which as warehouse-keeper he becomes accountable for. The Petition from the American and other mercliants at Bussorah complain ing of their not being furnished with an annual freight ship from Surat and other Hardships in respect to their trade from thence being now taken into con sideration, the President declares that part which relates to him is an absolute Falsity as he never gave orders to, or ever wrote a syllable to Mr. Price on the subject as the merchants alledge that gentleman informed their constituents and in regard to what they alledge against Mr. Price, he must be called upon to reply to it, when proper measures will be taken to prevent all complaints of this kind in future by making some necessary Eegulations in respect to Freight ships in general. We cannot however close this subject without remaking our surprize at the Agent and Council having referred the above Petition imme diately to our Hon'ble Masters, as translations of this nature ought to be submitted to us as their immediate superiors and through us to the Hon'ble Company. Acting otherwise is directly contrary to their and our Orders, and the General Rules prescribed for Advices to Europe. * * * * CLXXXV. Consultation of the President and Governor, etc., in Council. B ombay C astle , 31 Bt O ctober 1769. Public Department Diary No. 54 of 1769. ^ t t b t We feel an equal concern with our Hon'ble Masters for the distressed and to Karim Khan disgraceful situation of affairs in the Gulph of Persia which is not a little ieeSishment of aggravated by their ascribing it to our having been deceived by Mr. Skipp into faotorj at Bnshire. ^ c0Il flcl eilce i n Carem Caun which they alledge has been the source of all the errors in these affairs. Our minutes in Consultation the 24 th April last and our letter to Bussorah in consequence fully point out the reasons to which in our opinions the whole of our misfortunes in the Gulph are really to be ascribed and notwithstanding that letter is entered at length in our outward Letter Book that will be transmitted home by the ships now under Dispatch yet as we find by the Bussorah General Letter to the Hon'ble Company under the 16 th July, the Agent and Council did not communicate to them the Purport of that letter with that precision and impartial exactness as we directed or they ought Ordered than an attested copy of that Letter be now transmitted as a Paper apart in each of the Ships Packets now under dispatch which we flatter ourselves will induce them to alter their opinion on this subject. Notwithstanding the Hon'ble Company in the 59 th Paragraph of their Commands of the 31st March seem to recommend the withdrawing from -bushire, yet as in the sequel they strongly urge the Importance of procuring Ghilar Baw Silk which can be provided.nowhere so well as at that place we think it will be proper to send a gentleman again to Carem Caun to endeavour to settle / I259 heir upon proper Terms and when we take the Persia Affairs into consideration we shall give such instructions to the Agent and Council at Bussorah as may be judged suitable on the occasion. Tho' the Agent and Council has been pleased to represent Bussorah as the to^rt only Proper Market in the Gulph for woolens (which we hope has not pro- ^Basrahor ^ ceeded from self-interested motives) yet we have reason to believe from what we experienced at Bushire before the trouble between the Caun and Shaiks of that Place that a much larger quantity of Woolens may be sold and to greate r advantage in Persia and consequently that if the agency was removed to Bushire and Bussorah made a Eesidency as formerly it would be more for our Hon'ble Masters interest but in order to be enabled to give our Hon'ble Masters the best information in our Power on this subject, it is agreed to appoint a committee of Messrs. Wrench Jervis and Martyn to collect and point out to u s the advantages and Disadvantages of each as well from their own Knowledg- as from any information they may be able to obtain from Individuals report ing the same to us as soon as possible. CLXXXVL B ombay C astle, 5 th N ovember 1769. Public Department, Diary No. 54 of 1769, Wednesday 8.— Imported the Admiral Watson from Bussorah with a letter Bnssorah, Letter from the Agent and Council and one from Mr. Eobert Garden. The former bore date the 25 th September, acquainting us that they dispatched to us this Karim Khan ship that by the last intelligence they had from Bushire Caremj Caun had expeditTon D against ordered bis fleet to be got ready to proceed down the Gulph to act offensively ^ a n s ^ for Maskat against the Muscatters as the Imaum had refused his consent to some demands Coffee Fleet, made on him by the Caun but that, however, the tranquility of the Gulph might be interrupted by this rupture they should not interfere not only because our orders were positive against commencing hostilities against the Caun but that it would impede their plan of drawing the Trade of Persia to Bussorah and that however, they might wish the safe arrival of the Muscat Coffee Fleet both on account of the Benefit which the Hon'ble Company received from the Government Customs on the Coffee and the desire they had of obliging the Bussorah merchants together with the friendship which subsisted betwixt us and the Muscatters. Yet they did not think these considerations of sufficient weight to hazard a rupture with the Caun they should not therefore order a Convoy to bring up the above Fleet more especially as they apprehended the Imaums own vessels would be sufficient to protect it even if the Caun's Fleet were joined by that of the Chaub as it was imagined it would be that in case the Coffee Fleet could not procure a Convoy from the Imaum it was probable they would then wait at Muscat until the arrival there of the Drake or any other of our cruizers from the hope of a Convoy from them, they therefore stated the following question-Whether our cruizers were to give Convoy and protection to the Ships and Vessels of any Power whatever if at variano-e with the Caun unless such Ships and Vessels were furnished with English Passes and Colours and how far the furnishing such ships and vessels with such passes260 and colours was compatible with the Interests of the India Company. That on this point they requested our particular directions and that we would likewise forward orders to Captain Moore of the Drake on the same subject in time to arrive there before his Departure from thence which would be by the end of December unless we should direct the contrary. That when the Expedition and Fancy were at Bushire their commanders had been treated with civility by the Sheik of that place and enquiry made from them whether the English intended setling there and whether any cloth was on board the Cruizers. The Shaik was told that they (the Commanders) knew nothing of the former point and as to cloth they had none on board that many merchants it was said intended purchasing Woolens but that as they could not get them at Bushire they said they would go to Bussorah for them, that they (the Agent and Council) did not intend on any account sending Woollens down as the same would entirely frustrate the design of drawing the Persian Commerce to Bussorah. CLXXXVIL Extracts from the Busrah Factory Diary No. 8 of 1769-70. tfoM t0fick depreda ' ■ Five ^ ^ au ^' s and two armed boats are arrived off Menavi, with an hundred men in each, in order to assist the Turks in defending Bussora and the several villages about it, from the depredations of the Mon- tifick Arabs—their several Noguedah's were each of them vested with a Sable Coosk, by our Mussaleem. The Chaub has also wrote to the several petty Shaiks belonging to the Montificks, who are in possession of sundry coots and posts about Bussora desiring them immediately to cease all hostilities against the Turks, and decamp,' and has threatened them in case of their non-compliance, with marching against them, and destroying them and their possessions. Another tribe of Arabs called the Benechaali Arabs, are marching it is said to the assistance of the Turks. The Montifick Arabs we learn are all decamped from their several pos t about Bussora, the cause it is said, Shaik Abdalla's having ordered them to join him with all expedition. By a boat from Imaum Alii, a place of worship, held in great veneration hy the Turks, we learn the Baoha had left Bagdat, and was on his march for Bussora. The tribe of Arabs called the Hazace Arabs, under their Shaik Ahmood we learn with two other tribes have joined Shaik Abdalla of the Montiflcks. Advices from Grain received this morning by a. merchant in town, mention two large boats from Muscat, belonging to the Suree Arabs, laden with coffee and other gruff, and bound to Bussora, being taken by the Persian Galivats— the crews belonging to these boats were put into a small boat, and sent to Grain by the Commander of the Persian fleet. The cause as we learn of the dispute between the Persians and Muscat Arabs is, the demands made by Carem Caun on the Imaum of Muscat consist ing of the Persian ship which has been for so long a time in possession of the Musoatters, and the arrears of annual tribute, which the Muscatters formerlv paid to Nadir Shah during his usurpation in Persia.261 The Musoatters in their behalf, urge, that the ship was a lawful purchase, made by them, of Shaik Abdalla, the Shaik of Ormuze, for which thej exchanged several Galivats, and paid the balance in cash ; that they have been at a great expence in repairing the ship, that she had been long their property, and that, give her up they would not—that with respect to the annual tribute, paid Nadir Shah, he was too powerful a tyrant to contend with, and it was therefore paid him; not as tribute of right, but as a tribute that it would be very impoli- tick to refuse him. Nadir Shah however, and Carem Caun, they said were powers widely different, the one they dreaded, the other they rather despised; the one was the conqueror of all Persia, the other only Vackeel of two or three of its provinces—if therefore Carem Caun thought proper to persist in his demands, they would answer him by Cannon and ball, if he made use of that kind of argument with them. The Beneshroff and Suree Coffee fleet, are all arrived we hear at Muscat from Mocha, but the Imaum it is said has prevented their coming up to Bussoraj on account the troubles subsisting between him and Carem Caun. Several Turkish Gallies under the command of the Captain Bacha, with nine Galivats belonging to the Chaub (that arrived in the night from the Haffarly) with about 1,500 fighting men on board, are gone up the river against a tribe of Arabs in alliance with the Montificks, called the Kholt Arabs, and who are situated on the Persian side of the river between this and Coorna. Eourteen sail of the Chaub's Galivats, are now on Turkish service, five at an anchor off Menavi, and the nine mentioned above to be with the Captain ' Bacha up the river. It'is a galling circumstance to have the Chaub's Galivats, under the very muzzles of our Cruizers, and not dare to touch them, to think of it would be madness considering the Chaub's present connection with the Turks, and our present situation. The Bacha and Mussaleem have both of them sent the Khoran with their signets to the Chaub, as pledges for the security of his Galivats, now engaged in the Turkish cause. It is said the new Chaub begins to be heartily tired of his Persian connec tions, and that Carem Caun has fleeced him more during the three years, that he has been a Persian subject at Doorack, than he paid the Turks in a dozen, when he was a Turkish subject. CLXXXVIII. Bombay Castle, 10th November 1769, Honourable Sir and Sirs, In consequence of your Honour etc.'s orders to us dated the 2nd Instant, Letter from we called on Messrs. Morley and Skipp, who having each of them resided some- appointed to 66 time both in Turkey and Persia, were we apprehended capable of giving us settUng^agenoy much light into the subject matter of the enquiry recommended to us by your at Busb5re - Honour, etc. They positively affirm and in which we agree them that the great est assumption of Woolens in the Kingdom of Persia, and that having a settle ment at Bushire, on other secure and convenient place on the sea coast of thatI 262 Kingdom, would greatly encrease the Hon'ble Company's Sales, and more particularly so from the Directions at present given relative to the Commerce of Eaw Silk, they being of opinion that exclusive of the great Importance this Branch Trade may of itself be to the Company, Carem Caun would gladly take from two to three lacks of Rupees in Woolens annually provided Raw Silk is taken from him in return, he having made some offers of this kind to Mr. Skipp when at Schyras and as we are well acquainted, that the Caun owing to the present great Scarcity of Specie in the Kingdom receives a great part of his annual Revenues from the Provinces of Ghilan and Schuwan in this article of silk. They also observe to us they are firmly of opinion, that few, if any Per six Merchants of Credit would go to Bussora for the Purchase of Woolens, first because they would be able to purchase them with much less trouble to them selves from the Russia Merchants in the Northern Provinces, and next, there is such an inveterate Enmity subsisting between the Turks and Persians, on account of their difference in Religion, that the latter are in Turkish Govern ments always insulted and generally plundered and exclusive of these, that the additional expence and risque attending their going thither must be great. The three routes from Persia to Bussora must in this case be as follows, either by the way of Shistan and Haviza; by sea from Bushire and Bunderick or by Bagdad in the former the road is insecured, and Coffala's have been frequently plundered by the Chaub or Bennalim Arabs, and the Imposition collected on the Exporta tion from Bussora and at other Places till they reach Schuster must be con siderable ; tho. we cannot exactly ascertain the amount, that by Bushire or Bunderick, exclusive of the risk of the sea, it must also be attended with the charge of Ereight and other expences, with an Export duty from Bussora, of three or five per cent, and an Import of eight per cent, at Bushire or Bunderick the route by the way of Bagdat, owing to the present growing strength of the Arabs, and the small regard paid by them to the Turkish Government, is still less secure than either of the former, and Messrs. Morley and Skipp estimate that the Customs collected on Broad Cloth at the different Choukeys on the river and at Bagdad must amount to at least twenty per cent. They also add that they apprehend about one third of the Woolen sold of late years at Bussora, has been sent by some of these routes into Persia, and give it as their opinion, in which from our ow^n knowledge we concur with them, that even could the Persian Merchants be easily prevailed on to make their Purchases of Woolens solely at Bussora, they would even in this case considering the expences and disadvantages above pointed out, afford to give at least twenty per cent, more at Bushire for the same Cloths than at Bussora ; and in order that your Bonour, etc., may be more fully informed of the present state of both Markets, we have hereunto subjoiced a particular account of each in separate Columns together with the difference between them noted in a third. Erom this statement Your Honour etc., will observe that the present Bussora Prices are considerably encreased (in consequence of the orders from the Presidency on this subject) above the Terms of the Contract with Shaada, but then the Agent and Council write under the 29th of June 1767 that they are of opinion the utmost that market will take off in a year will not acceed one Lack of Rupees ; and if the Bushire prices be a little lowered in such articles as will admit thereof it may probably be a means of encreasing the vend; but at all events we are of^ opinion, that sortment on colours which tho merchants disliked, should not be263 pressed on them, but such only as all proper for the Consumption of the Country, the disadvantages of a contrary conduct, must be so very odious that our pointing them out becomes unnecessary. We here also beg leave to observe to your Honor etc., that had the Hon'ble the Company a strong fortified Factory at Bushire or other convenient Port on the Coast in like manner formerly at Gombroon, their property would we apprehend be equally secure at such Place as at Bussora, exclusive only of a war with any European Nation; and we must also add that since the late decay of the Turkish Power and Govt, at Bussora, and the growing strength of the Chaub, Montifick and Beanalion Arabs that Place does not at present appear to us to be very secure from any attempts these Arabs mig ht make against it. We are with respect Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, Your most obedient humble servants, (Sd) PliTER EL WIN WRENCH/ „ BENJAMIN JERVIS. „ THOMAS MOSTYN. B ombay, 3rd Noremher 1769. CLXXXIX.

We Eemarks in respect much fear a Direct application to the Caun or sending a Person or Purpose to t0 Karim g Khan rSOn solicit it might induce him to start many difficulties, and insist on many things t0 arim we C ould not consistently comply It would therefore in our opinion be much more eligible, if the Invitation comes first from him, which we think might be brought about by the Agents' writing Shaik Nassein in answer to his Invita- tion to resettle at Bushire, that if the Oaun is desirous of our having again - established there, and will write the Agent accordingly or empower him or other proper persons so to do, a Gentleman will be immediately sent to treat with him thereon. Agreed therefore that the Agent and Council be directed to write a Letter to this effect, and should an Invitation be received in conse- Moriey Mr. James quence, Mr. James Morley now appointed to the assistance of the Agency, t con b d%To D n t an 0 y him must be deputed to him with the like instructions as were given to Mr. Skipp, To be instructed. w ] ieil a t Shyrash, allowing for the alterations in affairs since that time by the Caun's being actually in possession of Charrack and other Circumstances ; he mast likewise be instructed to demand restoration of the Speedwell Snow taken by Meer Mahana when we were both at war with him, part of whose Cargoe the Agent and Council acquaint us has been reserved but if the Caun does not readily comply with these demands we do not think we have a right to insist upon it. Answer made by The answers which the Agent has already made to the above letter from Council to letter Shaik Nasseir appears to us very extraordinary, as we know not of any losses dsemed^extra- asir we have sustained by our connections with Carem Caun who has ever showed ordinary. a Inclination towards us, and manifested it in the very last Instance And why. by permitting theHon'ble Company's Horses and some Effects of Mr. Morley's left at Bushire, being sent off, after his precipitately abandoning that settlement and as to the Charges incurred by the Expedition, our being deprived thereof can in no wise with propriety be ascribed to him, but entirely to the precipitate conduct of the Agent and Council, in ordering the Troops and Vessels to India as noticed in our letter of the 9th November 1768 and which we foresaw and remarked in our Diary before we were advised of the event. CLXCL 4 O ur A gent and C ouncil at B ussorah. 1. Your several Advices to the 16th May last have duly come to hand. Letter from the 2. And as by the information we have received from the President and Council of Bombay, as well as from your Agency, are fearful least you Factory ^ should be led to pursue measures relative to a re-establishment in Persia which we in no wise approve, we have thought it expedient to communi cate to you our Sentiments and Orders thereupon by an Overland Convey ance, hoping that your early receipt thereof, will prevent the Execution of any part of the design which at the time of your last Advices was under deliberation. 3. We have here to observe that the measure recommended by the Presidency, we mean the Ee-Establishment of Bushire, or the forming somem 265 ^ her settlement on the Coast of Persia surprizes us more, as we must consider the Orders we gave for withdrawing from Bush ire as implying a prohibition of any attempt to re-settle in the Persian Dominions. Indeed we should have thought our Servants would have been sufficiently discouraged by reflecting ODly on the consequences which had attended the Presidency of Bushire, the re-establishment of which would involve the Company in certain Expences, and would probably be the source of perpetual disputes with the Oaun, subject us to fresh Grievances and Exactions, and expose our property to the like dangers as had twice constrained us to withdraw from it. 4. We have further to remark that a settlement at Bushire or any other part on the Coast of Persia, would not afford us the prospect of any consider able increase in the Sale of Woollen since the quantity which might be disposed of in Persia must in some measure lessen in the end in the Bussora Market. This we are led to conclude from the Report of the Bombay Committee appointed to enquire into the advantages and disadvantages of Bussorah and Bushire, wherein they allow that one-third part of the pur chase of Woollens at your Agency already finds a way to Persia. And as to any prospect of advantage from our advance in price which might be on the Sales in Persia, we have reason to apprehend it would by no means be equal to the expence of a Residency without mentioning the risk to which our property must be exposed, for as to the suggestion of the beforementioned Committee that the Company had a strong fortified Settlement in the Dominions of Persia their property would be equally secure there as at Bussorah the same is in itself so extravagant that it were needless for us to forbid the executing such a Plan, even were we disposed to restore the Factory of Bushire. But as from the foregoing Considerations we can by no means consent thereto. We hereby prohibit you in the strictest manner, not only from re-establishing Bushire, but from forming any other Settlement in the Persian Dominions without our express Permission. And if contrary to our Expectations you should have undertaken either the one or the other, we in this case require and direct you forthwith to withdraw such Settlement. 4. By our Directions on this subject you will perceive that the intended Embassy to Carem Caun is, as far as it relates to the Establishment of a Residency at Bushire, become altogether unnecessary, and as we do not see any other prospect of advantage likely to arise therefrom, we hope the same has not 'been pursued, and we hereby direct that no such expensive visits be at any time undertaken without the greatest probability of reaping every proposed advantage from them. * * * L ondon, 24th August 1770, CXCII. Agent and Council, Basrah, to the Presidency. H on'blb S ir and S irs. ****** 11. We have been under the necessity to defer entering into the Negotia- ab&lt;)ut tipn you ordered with Carem Caun, until we received your further orders Bushire deferred.266 because we had not a proper Present for him nor were the proper articles for constituting it procurable in Bussora, and because there was no person here in whom we could confide in as a Linguist. As so much depends on a just inter pretation between the Oaun and the Person sent to him, and as in this Country nothing can be transacted without a suitable present; we doubt not but our Eeasons for the delay will prove satisfactory to your Honour, etc. Enclosed you will receive a List of such articles as will be acceptable to the Vakeels and we humbly recommend the sending the Present from Bombay, made up of those articles to the Amount that you may desire it, we submit also to your Honour, etc., the propriety of sending Mr. Dow in order to accompany Mr. Morley, as so much useful information may be procured from his knowledge in the Persian Language, and so much greater confidence can be placed in his Inter pretation, than in that of any of the Country People. 12. The application to Shaik Nassir that you recommended to us has likewise been deferred as we could not for the foregoing reasons accept his invitation in order he did send us one until we received a letter from him, making us an offer of his Friendship, inviting us to return to Bushire, and then to send a Person to Sberas in order to procure the Vackeel's phir maund for a settlement at that place. The Letter from the Shaik does not appear to be authorized by the Caun and we have reason to imagine has been occasioned by his apprehensions as bearing of the Arrival of one of his Majesty's ships in the Gulph—this opinion we are the more confirmed in, because in a letter which he wrote to inform us he expressed great indifference respecting our return, notwithstanding he had been informed by Shaik Ise of Mr. Morley's arrival and of a Conference which he had with that gentleman on the subject when he touched at Buslure in his passage from Bombay. Our letter to and from Shaik Ise, etc. on account the renewal of our Negotiations with Carem Caun, your H on our, etc., will find in our Diary under the head of Country Correspondence. 13. On the subject of the Negotiation with Carem Caun, and resettlements in Persia, relative also to the sales at Bussora and Bushire, the Agent begs leave to submit to your Honour, etc., consideration, his letters to us of the 24ith May and 23rd July with the Points and statement that accompanied them they are entered in our Diary under the 26th May, and 24th July the Copy of the former has been already sent for the inspection of our Hon'ble Masters and a copy of the latter will be sent them by the next opportunity.

H onourable S ir and S irs, Under the 7th instant We are favoured with your Commands of the 19th Movementg of April and 25th July last by the Revenge, Captain Nesbit, which arrived here the 9th instant your original packet for the Hon'hle Company's enclosed therein, and a packet received here at the same time from Surat were dispatched to Aleppo under the 10th by a pair of Messengers express, and the Duplicate shall follow them in a few days agreeable to your orders. 2. Our quiet situation in this Gulph rendering the Eagle and Dolphin at present sufficient for all our purposes, the Expedition Cruizer, Captain Halb was under orders for returning to Bombay and should have departed from hence Under the 10th Instant, had not the Admiral of the Eevenge, and the above despatch to Europe prevented her. She is however now dispatched to you at the same time we submit to your Honor's etc., consideration the propriety of her being immediately returned to us, as in all probability we shall be under the necessity of sending the Eagle over in January or February next with a large consignment of raw silk, and we think our situation renders a guard ship necessary at this Place, the Revenge shall follow her under the 81st Instant, and Lieutenant Adam Sheriff, when you ordered to Bombay will proceed on her. 3. The Admiral Pocock, Mr. William Magee Supra Cargoe, which arrived here from Bengal under the 7th ultimo, with a Cargce of Piece Goods, departs in Company with the Expedition, and sails for Bengal. At Mr. Magee's Request one of the under officers of the Revenge acts as second Mate on board her, but is to take the first opportunity of returning to the Marine at your Place. 4. We have not received any letters from Schyras as since the date of Warlike prepa»- our last Respects of the 31st of August per Drabee. Private advises from Persia Khan, however mention that Carem Caun is making great warlike preparations and had advised an additional army of 30 thousand Horse and 20 thousand Eoot, but the cause thereof is not yet certainly known : some are of opinion thi sarmy is to be sent into the Northern parts of Persia, near the Caspian Sea, in order to guard those frontiers, and to prevent the Disturbances which might other wise happen there from the Turkish and Russian parties ; others say that he is apprehensive of an attack from Ahmad Shaw the famous King of the Afghans, who was some time ago reported to be dead. Ahmed Shaw hath till lately supported Shasook Shaw a blind Descendent, of Shaw Nadirs, in possession of Mosched, in opposition to Carem Caun. Having some disputes with Sharook, he has taken Mesched from him by force. The approach of his army therefore is thought is the cause of the Caun s apprehension, the. the Caun's assistance had been asked by Sharook and refused it is said also that Carem Caun has repeated his positive orders against the Exportation of specie from Persia, on pam not only of its being confiscated but on pain also of the confiscation of all the Owners other effects a Caravan to Bushire in which was specie to the amount of 500 Tomaunds was stopt by the Caun's orders, the Money seized, and the Owner thrown into Prison. 5. Hossein Caun, who expelled Meer Mahana from Carrack, and who is at present Governor of that Island, and Bunderick, has wrote to the Agent offering him his friendship, assistance to our ships and a Factory at Bunderick268 To his letter a polite answer has been returned, thanking him for his offer of service, bufc informing him that for partieular reasons, we cannot for the present think of settling a Factory at Bunderick or elsewhere. 6. At the request of the Goveramant of this place one Ibrahim Effendi, a Bussora Turk, has been put on board the Expedition, and Captain Hall has orders to land him at Muscat, on his Arrival at that place. * * • * * We are with all due respect, Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, Your very obedient humble servants, Sd.

To—The Honorable the Court of Directors for Affairs of the United Compauy of Merchants of England tradingto the East Indies. Honorable Gentlemen, at e Bw8h 0m ageDCy Agent's ill-heath, the almost general sickness which has lately reigned among Us, the multiplicity of business occasioned by fresh troubles in this Gulph and by the ships returning from hence to India: these have been the causes of and we hope will excuse Us to your Honors for the long detention of the Duplicate Packet received from Bombay &amp; the Resolution; it is now however forwarded to Aleppo by Messengers express, and we hope that the speedy and safe arrival of the Original, dispatched from hence the 2nd July will have rendered of no consequence this tardy dispatch of the Duplicates. 2. In our last respects of the foregoing date of which the enclosed is a duplicate we informed your Honors of a report then current here that the Carrack Gallivats under Hossein Caun had in consequence of Carem Caun, sailed to the southward, in order to make prizes of all the vessels without excep tion which they could master, 3. 'We paid little regard to thio report, because we had several groundless ones to the same purport ever since our factory at Bushire was withdrawn, and indeed we flattered ourselves that Carem Oaun, the King of Persia, had too great a regard for his character however despicable it before might be, not to render it entirely oo, by adding without the least provocation the crime of piracy to it.269 4. The report however to our great concern proved but too true, three of the G alii vats sailed down the Gulph with the pyratical design^abovementioned, Admiral Hossei* and under the 22nd June, off Oongoon, they made themselves masters of the Britannia Captain Shaw, an English Snow from Bombay, laden with Sugar, Iron, Spices etca. belonging to Mr. Shaw, and of a Country Ketch from Gogo, under English Colours, laden with Cotton and Grutt, besides a Botella Ketch and sundry boats from Muscat—or getting possession of them the Arabs endeavoured to bring them up to Carrack, but a strong Northwester preventing them, they carried the Vessels over to Bahreen, in the river of which they lay, until they thought their way open to Bunderick they then left Bahreen and arrived with their prizes at Bunderick the 27th July—the two Vessels are now there. the Gogo one is lying in the river, but the Britannia stuck on the bar, and before the tide lifted, a fresh wind came on, and has entirely ruined her not above one half of the Britannia's Cargoe was carried to Bunderick the Arabs having plundered and sold what they could of it on the Arab coast. 5. The news of the capture reached us the 9th July—We immediately ordered the Resolution, Expedition and Dolphin down to Carrack and Bunde rick, or to any other places where they might receive intelligence that the Vessels were lying; which at this time it was said were both English property— a letter was wrote by the Agent to Hossain Caun, demanding the release of the Vessels with everything belonging to them, and Commodore Inn was directed in case of refusal, not only to do his utmost to recover them, but to take or destroy the Gallivats belonging to the pirates—But in case this was out of his power, he was then directed to send the Expedition to Muscat in order to give convoy fco such English Vessels for Bussora as might be lying there, and to cruize himself off Carrack in the Resolution with the Dolphin, provided the Vessels were at that Island, and he thought his doing so would be of any Service in preventing their Cargoes being carried over to the Continent. 6. The Squadron sailed from hence the 12th July—it proceeded first to C irrack, but finding no Vessels there. Commodore Inu sailed for Bunderick, where he arrived the 14ith—he immediately sent on shore the Linguist with the Agent's letter to Hossain Caun, and finding that he did not immediately return, he sent the Expedition and Dolphin to Bushire to gain intelligence relative to the Vessels; perceiving also that he could not get to the Gallivats or to a Botella Ketch then in the river ; on the linguist's coming on board with an unsatisfactory answer from Hossain Caun he returned to Bussora with the Expedition and Dolphin. 7. Hossain Caun being at Carrack, the linguist on his arrival was carried to his Vackeel, and from him to three of Carem Caun's people who were then at Bunderick to take an account of the prizes: these demanded from the Linguist the Agent's letter, and on his refusal to deliver it to any but Hossem Caun, they threatened to take it by force ; they did not however think proper to put their threats into execution—Hossain Caun the next morning arrived from Carrack and received the letter—he at first talked of attacking the Expedition and Dolphin had not the Resolution been with them, but in private with the Linguist he spoke in a different manner ; he then threw the whole blame of the late acts of Pyracy on Carem Caun, and desired the Linguist to assure the .Agent, that for himself he wanted to be friends with the English, would enter into an alliance, and if they would not to molest him, he said he would give them up Carrack and remain under them there, throwing off all allegiance to Carim Caun—these promises he repeated to the Linguist on a dispute happening270 'between him and Carem Caun's people aboye mentioned relative to the Cargoes —in his reply to the Agent's letter he pretends to say that the Britannia was not taken by any orders from him or Oarem Oaun, that she first attacked the Oallivats, was taken by them in their own defence, and that he would return her to us as soon as she arrived at Bunderick—he has not, however, thought proper to keep his promise to us on this head. 8. His treatment to our people was most inhuman; they could hardly rocure from him the least shelter from the Sun, or the most common neces saries of life—Captain Shaw and his 1st Officer Mr. Nicholson, were ordered ta Schyras by Carem Caun, in order to give him an account of the Cargoe of the Britannia: they left Bunderick the 1st of this month, but the Captain it is said died the day after—part of the Crew was sent to Eushire and arrived here from thence the 16th instant—the 2nd Officer Mr. Rowe, and the remainder of the people, except one or two lascars, were returned to us by Hossain Caun at the Agent's desire and sent to India on board the Bombay Grab —the arrival and departure of which will be noticed in a following part of this address—the Letters and Papers on board the Britannia were all destroyed by the Arabs, in order to prevent Carem Caun's getting an account of the cargoe in Hossain Caun's reply to the Agent's letter on this occasion, he assures him neither he or Carem Caun were the cause of the late hostilities, that Sheik Nassir of Bushire was the sole promoter of them. 9. Mr, Rowe informs us that Hossain Caun is most commonly intoxicated with liquor; that his people are very poor and mutinous, that they constantly go armed, and it is with great difficulty that he can keep them in order—his fleet consists of ten Gallivats and several boats—one of the Gallivats carries 10 guns, another 8 and the rest 6 each mostly 6 pounders: they are extremely well built, carry 60 to 80 men, and the largest does not draw above five feet water—The fort on Carrack is almost entirely neglected by the Persians, and is near falling in several places: in general there are not above 30 to 50 men there, but when any of our Vessels appear near the Island, a number of men is trans ported over from Bunderick in boats in the night. 10. Carem Caun's people being down at Bunderick to take an account of the Cargoes of the captive Vessels, and his ordering up the Captain and Officer of the Britannia to Schyras, leave rot a doubt but the late Pyracies have been committed by his orders—by all accounts the capture of English vessels was particularly recommended by him, notwithstanding his principal men at Schyras represented to him the impropriety of molesting us, and the disgrace that would attend his doing so—the Agent wrote a letter to him under the 15th July desiring to know if he gave such orders, but he has not returned an answer to it, nor will he (as the Pallamar who carried the letter writes us) reply to it, until the Captain and Officer of the Britannia arrive to give him an account of the cargoe—in the meantime, the Pallamar is not suffered by him to go out of the gates of Schyras. wpeTtio^fcoTbs. 11- In a letter therefore to our Honorable Superiors of the 9th instant, we Persian CMiif.. have humbly submitted to them the propriety of sending up a sufficient marine and land force, not only to destroy the Carrack Gallivats, and any forts and places in the Gulph which may offer to protect them, but to revenge on Carem Caun the unprovoked Pyracies he has committed against us; by destroying or taking any places or Islands which may affect his Revenues and every Gallivat nnder his orders—under this head we may rank, the Carrack fleet consisting as before observed of 10 Gallivats besides armed boats; the Bushire fleet which271 consists of 7 or 8 Gallivats, 2 Ships, besides boats—the Chaub's fleet consisting of 14 or 15 Gallivats, and the Otmus fleet of about a dozen more—The late troubles have convinced us that these must be destroyed before our trade to and from this Gulph can have any prospect of security—the Oarrack fleet has a Iready declared itself; the Chaub's it is said is out with an intention of seizing all Vessels it can master, and the Sheik of Bushire is in daily expectation of receiving orders from Carem Caun to prepare his fleet for the same purposes— when Captain Farmer was sent to Bushire by the Commodore, the Sheik ordered his boat immediately off, otherwise he threatened to detain her and her crew— his excuse for this behaviour is, that he was afraid of some of Carem Caun's people then at Bushire, and his civility afterwards to Captain Elphinstone of the Bombay Grab, and his humane treatment of the Britannia's people who were sent to Bushire, seem to make this excuse of the Sheik's a plausible one. 12. The Marine force for the purposes abovementioned should in our humble opinions consist of a large ship for battering with one or more of the first and second rates, a Bomb Vessel, and about 10 or 12 of the small craft to run after the Gallivats into shoal water—the land force of 500 Europeans at least, a train of Artillery, and 1,500 to 2,000 sepoys—the Expedition ought to be sudden; without stopping at Muscat, it ought immediately to proceed up the Gulph, begin with the Ormus Gallivats and take or destroy every Gallivat that belongs to the Persians whether an alliance with the Muscatters who have been injured by Carem Caun, and assistance from them might not be of service, and lighten the expence to your Honors has been humbly submitted by us to our Superiors consideration. 13. The proposals made by Hossein Caun of delivering us up Carrack, and remaining there under us, in our opinions do not merit a serious consider ation—He has no means of subsistence but by piracy and would expect that we would authorise and protect him in it, besides he has taken an extraordinary method of gaining our friendship by seizing our Vessels with us too, it little signifies whether his assertions with respect to Sheik Nassir being the sole cause of the late hostilities be true or not—let who will have been the adviser, it is very certain that Hossein Caun has been the executor of them, and it is almost as certain that Carem Caun ordered him to commit them. 14. Your Honors we believe will agree with us that this is not a proper ciaim« agaimt Season for making' an application to the Chaub for the amount due by him on tiie account the depredations committed on our trade, which was recommended to us by our Superiors in their orders to us by the Resolution—before the late troubles took place indeed, we were of opinion that such an application would not have answered the end our Superiors proposed from it—demands in this country unless supported by a respectable force, as we have formerly observed to them, only serve to under the party who makes them contemptible—the present Chaub is by all accounts as avaritious as the former ones, and will never give up any part of what has been taken from us unless he is compelled to do so—as a proof of this, the Turks have for a long time past had a demand on him from 20 to 30,000 Rupees, and th6 at peace with him, have not as yet recovered a fluce from him—he has seemed for sometime past at peace with us, and we thought it best to let him continue so—on an application for the restitution of our property, he might be apt to imagine that we had still thoughts of demanding it in another manner whenever we had it in our power, he might therefore consider us as still at war with him, and might recommence hostilities against our trade, because (from our inactivity on his refusal of i272 restitution) he might think we were not in a condition to resent them—these reasons induced us to defer the application to the Ohaub until our Superiors further Orders—should they continue in the determination of making one to Mm, in our humble opinions, an application direct from them will have more weight than one from us—or should they think proper to send a force to destroy the Ghaub, in opposition to Carem Caun, we will give it every assistance in our power—the attempt will certainly be attended with difficulty, but as observed in a former part of this address, whilst one Gallivat is left in the Gulph, our Vessels to and from it cannot trade with any security—the Ohaub has lately put out the eyes of Busboos, the only surviving Son of Sheik Soliman. 15. Within these few days the Agent has received a letter from the Kia of Bagdat, requesting to know wherein he can be of serviceable to us, and informing him that the Bacha will send a person to Schiras in order to solicit from Oarem Oaun, the return of our vessels, in case the Agent should approve his so doing—we think nothing but disgrace to us, would attend such a pro ceeding, we shall therefore thankfully decline the Kiats offer aud inform him, that we have already wrote to Carem Gaun without his having deigned to return an answer, and that we wait for the orders of our Honorable Superiors in what manner to act with regard to him. 16. The Basha has lately appointed Soliman Aga who was formerly Mussaleem here, to the Government of Bussora in the room of Eusooph Aga ; goliman Aga arrived here the 26th instant, but as Eusooph Aga has always hehaved in a most friendly manner towards us, the change gives Us much concern, especially too, as such appointments are always attended with expence to your Honors of Presents, etc. Torkfeh debfe. 17. The collection of the Turkish duties on the Country property lately imported has been deferred until Soliman Aga's arrival, we hope however in a short time to carry the amount of our part thereof to the credit of the Bacha's debt, which this day stands as follows:— Tomaunds. On account Booralties received from Elias, Shaada and Jacob for the clearance of tbe Warehouse remains . 46,42,08,28 On account the expenses of the fleet for which the Basha refuses booralties . • . . . . . 2,05,00,00 6,692,08,28 18. Such Honorable Gentlemen is the situation of your affairs with respect to the several powers in this Gulph. 19. In the foregoing part of this address we informed you that Com modore Ince finding he could not get to the Gfallivats or to a Botella Ketch then at Bunderick returned to us with the Expedition and Dolphin—the squadron arrived here the 26th and 27tli July—his reasons for not sending the Expedition to Muscat agreable to our Orders was, that Captain Farmer, one his Officers, his Boatswain and the best part of his ships Company were sick, by which means the Expedition was rendered incapable of fighting the Gaun's fleet. 20. This conduct of the Commodores appeared to us very exceptionablCj in our opinions he ought to have supplied the Expedition with Men from the Resolution, and provided Captain Earmer was incapable of Duty, to have put her under the charge of his first Officer^ he ought then to have sent her and the Dolphin at least to the Arab coast as well as to Bushire to gain intelligence273 and look after the vessels, and the Expedition afterwards to Muscat agreeable to our orders—had he done this we had some reason to think the Vessels might have been recovered, but by bringing the Expedition to Bussora, the security of the trade to this Gulph was very much endangered. 21. Fortunately however the TTnion and Betsey from Bengal had taken advantage of the Resolution's protection from Bushire, and imported here the 6th July—fortunately too, the Bombay Grab having lost her passage to Mocha, and put into Muscat, Captain Elphinstone proceeded up the Gulph for the benefit of the health of his ship's Company and took under his protection, the Success Merchant Ketch, Captain Burr from Bombay and the Fox Gallivat Lieutenant Feattus from Muscat, which vessels he overtook in his passage the Bombay Grab arrived here the 28th the Success and Fox under the 29th July—the Fox was dispatched from hence to Bombay under the 9th May, but Lieutenant Feattus on his arrival at Muscat having no hopes of gaining his passage before the monsoon, he left Muscat for this place under the 13th June, af ^r having forwarded our packet to Bombay under the 11th by the way of Scindy. 22. As we did not consider the Expedition and Dolphin of sufficient force to cope with the Carrack Gallivats, especially should they be joined with those of Doorack or Bushire, we thought it prudent to detain the Fox in the Gulph and as we bad intelligence of the Peppercorn an English Vessel for Bussora lying at Muscat, as we heard also that another English Vessel was shortly expected there from Bombay, the Expedition and Fox were dispatched to Muscat under the 2nd instant in order to give Convoy to them. 23. They proceeded also to Bunderick with the Agent's letter to Hossain Caun requesting the delivery of the Britannia's people—whilst they lay off Chat Port, Carem Caun's people there, wanted Hossain Caun to send out four of his Gallivats to attack them, but he was too prudent to make the attempt. 2dL The Resolution which arrived here from Bombay the 4th Ultimo, was dispatched to Bombay under the 10th instant with advices of the late troubles ; and the Bombay Grab departed for the Presidency under the 26th giving Convoy as far as Muscat to the Betsey Galley Captain Rooseboom for Surat, Bombay and Bengal, the Union Captain Justice for Bengal, and the Success Ketch, Captain Burr for Bombay, 25, The Dolphin Brig the only Vessel now here is detained by us, in order, for the forwarding by her any packets which you may send us for India, whilst the Expedition and Fox are cruizing to the Southward. We have, HENRY MOORE, &amp;c. B ussora 31st August 1771. cxcv. The Court of Directors to the Agent and Council at Bussorah. 1. Since the receipt of your advices wereby our order acknowledged on the The recent pro. 14th June last, your letters under the following Dates have come to our hands, agenoy^condemned 6 ' Proposal for expedi tion disapproved. 15th May 1771 .... on the 27th September 1771. 2nd July Ditto. Sbst August ..... 12th November 1771.274 2. It is with equal concern and surprize, we received the advice which your last letter mentions, that Hossein Caun, Commandant of Carem Caun's Gallivats, had made capture of the Britannia, Captain Shaw, two Ketches, and some small boats off Gongoon in June last (the first mentioned, and one of the Ketches being under Eaglish Colours) and that you had taken the resolution to submit it to the Presidency to furnish you with a very large and expensive Marine aud Land force, for commencing hostilities, in order to reduce the forces of Hossein Caun, and such others, cruizing in the Gulph, who were hostily interrupting the trade there, and express your desire to enter upon operations by Land, in order to obtain reparation for the injuries sustained. 3. Looking upon this as a matter nearly concerning our Interest, we cannot lose a moments time in expressing our entire disapprobation of your proposal of seeking redress by force of Arms, and thereby exposing us to an expence which the Advantages derived from our Intercourse in the Gulph will by no means justify ; and although we cannot suppose the Presidency, even if they were inclined to it, can furnish the proposed Armament, yet least they should coincide in your sentiments, and aid you in part so far, as to put you in a condition to revenge the insult committed by Carem Caun, you are to observe it as a point that the last necessity only can warrant; but in the mean time you must employ every other means in your power to procure restitution for the present losses and future security of the Navigation and Commerce in the Gulph of Persia. 4. And we cannot here avoid observing that the three Cruizers in the Gulph under your Orders in August last, were equal to the protection of the trade there, and sufficient to countenance the spirited Ilemonstrances you should make on the insults you had received. 5. If all efforts to put an end to the Piratical views of the Persians and other Powers in .the Gulph, and to procure Reparation of Injuries, without having recourse to Arms, shall prove ineffectual; You are to represent the same to the Presidency, that they may lay it before the Commanding Officer of his Majesty's Ships in the East Indies and endeavour to obtain such pro tection and assistance in the circumstances as the case shall require. 6. And in the meantime if those powers shall continue to interrupt your Commerce, we are desirous it should have all the Security, that your Situations in conformity to these our orders shall enable you to afford.—It appears to us that the Establishment of a Rendezvous at Muscat will be a very proper measure for that purpose, that the shipping bound up the Gulph may proceed from thence under a sufficient Convoy and for such Convoy, we esteem the Resolution and Dolphin, or Vessels of equal force, with a few Gallivats, sufficient. 7. Having taken into consideration what you write on the Subject of the Ghilan Raw Silk, and the large quantity of the Stock of 'Wollens which have remained so long in warehouse at your Settlement, and at Bombay for your Market; We are willing, and accordingly authorize you, to dispose of those Woollens, in barter for silk entirely, without the advance of Cash for purchase thereof, unless you shall find it utterly impossible to procure the Silk on those terms; and then we hope you will be able to procure it, allowing the Merchants a Quarter part in Cash in payment for such Raw Silk —and when you have disposed of the remains of Woollens in your hands, and those expected from Bombay, desigaed for your Settlement, in exchange for Silk as above-mentioned ; you are to obey the orders contained in our letter to you275 dated the 15th March last, for ceasing to buy any more Silk until our further pleasure shall be signified. 8. You complain of the Colours of the Cloth by the Resolution being very indifferent, for want of a proper proportion of Scarlets. This you have mentioned in former letters, and to which you had very proper answers, that it was originally your own fault, by indenting to Bombay for the fine Colours in a greater proportion than ever was allowed before, and to which we now attribute the great remains we have, of what you call improper Colours. It has been usual to send such a quality of fine Colours, as would enable you to dispose of all the Cloth, if you had acted in a manner always practised in the Gulph, to sell a proportion of all Colours with the fine. You most know, that the Scarlets and all the fine Colours cost much more than the common Colours, which you ought to regard in the Sale ; and in future must not deviate from the custom formerly practised. Your loving friends, JOHN PURLING, &amp; CO. L ondon ; The 15th November 1771. CXCVI. Extract from a letter of the Agent and Council at Bassrah to the Court of Directors, dated 22nd April 1773. ' We leave this (letter) in order to be forwarded to you by the first Plague breaks out opportunity that offers, it is purposely to inform you that the plague having broke out in Bussora just after we last addressed you which was the first of this month, the Agent and some of your Honours' Servants retired to Belvoir about 4 miles from Bussora, and the rest shut themselves up in the Factory in town, hoping that in a short time the summer setting in would put a stop to this calamity, in the m ean time the Drake and Tiger were stationed at Belvoir and all communication was stopt with the country people—the disorder since that time has continued to rage with unrelenting vigour, One thousand and upwards have been daily carried off by it, and contrary to our expectation, and the opinions of several here, the heat instead of cheking has rather in creased it. In this calamitous situation, the contagion spreading around us even to our very doors, the provisions which we had laid in for our subsist ence beginning to fall short, and no method of recruiting them without running the greatest risque at the same time of receiving the contagion, our Domestics too having all left us; we have unanimously thought it the most prudent and eligible method, as well for the preservation of our own lives, as that those of the people belonging to the two Vessels, to leave the place and retire to Bombay, from whence we can return at the opening of the season in case we hear that the disorder has ceased our stay here could answer no one good purpose, no business whatever can be transacted, nor would it be prudent at any rate to have any communication with the Country people for these 6 months at least, your Honours have no outstanding debts of any consequence, and as we have recommended the care of your Factory after having sealed up the Godowns etc. to the Government here, and have besides appointed Coja Netrus and Coja Mircar two respectable Armenian Merchants, your Vakeels,276 in our absence, we do not think your effects will run the least risque. We have concealed from the people however our intention of going as far as Bombay, for whilst they were ignorant when we shall return they will be more on their guard. Your Honours may be assured we have maturely considered this step, and that our regard to your interest, as well as to our own fortunes, which on account Outstanding debts etc. are left in a much more precarious situation than your affairs, would prevent our adopting it without we were convinced of the absolute necessity of it.'* CXCVII. To The Honourable the Court of Directors for affairs of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies. HoNouiiABLB Gentlemen, Letter from Agreeable to what we wrote you under the 23rd April, we depended Henry Moore &amp; co. . tt • ( Maskat.) The from Bassora on that date, we are very sorry to acquaint your Honours that m monf and^ Gre^n proceeding down the river, the Tygar which was ahead of the Drake about 3 sWps to^Banrerik^ ^ m ^ es &gt; wa ® boarded by 4 of the Burderic Galliwats under the 26th and notwithstanding the Drake's utmost endeavours to overtake them, she was towed off by them, and by another Gallivat which afterwards joined them they had permitted the Tyger to pass them without any show of molestation. Lieutenant Scott who commanded her imagined therefore they were Muscat Vessels, and was not convinced of his mistake untill the Gallivats people poured in in great numbers upon his decks. Lieutenant Scott finding this, that his Lascars had all jumped overboard, and having only 11 Europeans to oppose to the numbers which attacked him, he also jumped overboard and together with 2 other Europeans and two Lascars belonging to the Tyger was taken up by the Drake. Messeurs Beaumont and Green were taken with the Tyger. To have proceeded to Bunderick with the hopes of retaking the Tyger would have been fruitless as the Gallivats had got the start of the Drake of several hours owing to her draft of water, not permitting her to pass the bar untill the next morning, we were sensible also that it would have been equally fruitless to proceed there to demand her restitution, and that of the two Gentlemen, we therefore thought it best to prosecute our Voyage with the utmost expedition, lest from the lateness of the Season the Drake should lose her passage to Bombay. The Swallow Sloop of War brought to Bussora under the 7th April 65 Bales of Piece Goods on freight from Surat, and as Sir John Gierke the Com mander would not on account the plague permitt of any boats coming on board to land them, he resolved to carry them back to India ; as we had at that time * In conformity with the above resolution the Agent in Council, consisting of the Gentlemen mentioned in • i, Mr. Moore. the margin,* left Bussora on tlie same day, the four former 2- Mr. Lewis. in the Hon'hle Company's Vessel 'Drake,' and the two 4. Mr. G.'Abraham! 0 6 latter in the 'Tiger;' The Drake arrived in the Bombay 5. Mr. Beaumont. Harbour, on the 14th of the following month, when she 6. Mr. Green. was ordered to proceed to Butcher's Island to perform quarantine ; Messrs. Moore, Lewis, Latouche, and Abraham accordingly remained on Butcher's Island until the 17th June when they were allowed to land in Bombay. The ' Tiger ' however, having on board Messrs. Beaumont and Green, was captured off the Island of Ormus m the Persian Gulf on the 26th April, by some Banderick Gallivats, and both of those Gentlemen were taken prisoners to Shirauz, where after being kept for some time, they were removed to Bushire ; Mr. Green was released on the 2nd September 1774, and reached Bussora on the 19th of the same month. Mr. Beaumont wae detained a prisoner at Bushire until the 22nd April 1775, when he was released after a captivity of nearly two years. In conformity with instructions from Government Mr. Moore left Bombay cn the 28th October 1773 on his return to Bussora.277 hopes of the disorder being of short continuance and as we were sensible of the great inconvenience which the owners would suffer if the bales were carried back, Captain Mackenley was ordered to receive them on board the Drake ; by which means she is not in such a proper condition for action as could be wished, even though 4 of the Bales were thrown overboard ; this has been another cause of our not proceeding to Bunderick lest the whole force should have been sent out against us ; if we have been to blame in thus loading the Drake we hope the necessity of the late calamitous times will plead our excuse. The Swallow brought no packet for your Honours either from Surat or Bombay, and left Bussora under the 9th April. We have the pleasure to acquaint you that on a further remonstrance from the Agent to the Mussnleem before our departure from Bassora, Coja Yacoob your Honours Broker was released by him. We arrived here yesterday and shall depart for Bombay to-morrow morning—we leave here Mr. Abraham to wait the arrival of a Cruizer which was to be sent about this time from Bombay for the protection of the trade to the Gulph—he is directed to open our Superiors packet, and if the cruizer should in his and the Commanders opinion be of sufficient force to defend herself against the powers in the Gulph he is to proceed in her with the trade to Bushire, and there wait intelligence from Bussora relative to the plague; in the meantime he is to endeavour to procure the restitution of the Tyger and the release of Messieurs Beaumont and Green—in case the sickness is not ceased at Bussora before the month of September, and he has no hope of its breaking up there, he is then to return with the Cruizer to Bombay. With respect to any packet from our Superiours to your Honours, He is directed not to forward it to Bussora by boat, unless the cruizer cannot proceed thither. Our orders being so positive from Bombay against acting offensively against any of the powers in the Gulph, and as we are uncertain what measures our Honourable Superiors will pursue when they hear of the capture of the Tyger, we have directed Mr. Abraham to order the Commander of the cruizer not to act offensively against the Gallivats, unless they should approach nearer than prudence will allow, and he thinks their intention is to attack him. Mr. James Collings remains as assistant to Mr. Abraham. We have landed here the Bales which the Drake received from the Swallow, and have thereby properly cleared her. We inclose you a duplicate of our last address of the 23rd April, and are. Honorable Gentlemen, Your respectful and faithful humble Servants H. M. W. D. L, G.

Nairandass the English broker to be forwarded you by a Dingey which will sail up^BushireundeJ to-morrow for Bombay, duplicate of our last respects of the 19th ultimo, but is order^! Khan s chiefly to advise you of the purport of letters from Doctor Eeilly and Coja Pitrus dated Bussora the 16th October, and received four days ago. They advise Carem Caun had given orders to all the different ports belonging to him to stop all Gallivats trankeys &amp;c. and get them repaired in readiness to receive a quantity of Provisions which would be sent down from Country. That Shaik Nassir of Bushire had arrived at that place from279 Schyras to take the command of the Persian fleet, and that a body of troops were assembling under the Command of Tacky Caun—The Oaun gives out these preparations are designed against Muscat. But letters from Mr. Beau mont and one Coja Marcar A via an Armenian who had been at Schyras, gives great room to apprehend that they are intended against Bussora— L a letter from Bagdat of the 5th October advises that Ally Whoolly Caun, Governor of Kearmanshaw (a Province in Persia under Carem Caun, and about 80 Leagues from Bagdat) was preparing to attack Coordistan which is under the Bagdat Government, and about 40 or 50 leagues distant from tlience. Carem Cawn opened the Pearl which was found on board the Tvger, some of it he gave to the Commanders of the Gailivats which took her, the remainder he kept himself, he directed them to continue hostilities against the English, and to alter the Tyger to a Gallivat—There were various reports Respecting his treatment of Messieurs Beaumont and Green, but they are silent themselves with respect to it—they applied to him for their liberty, but he desired them to wait until some of his people had returned, whom he had sent to Bussora, under pretence of demanding the effects of his subjects, who had been carried off there by the Plague : but it was suspected that this was not their real errand. Soliman Aga had been appointed Mussaleem of Bussora in the room of Eusooph Aga, and had in' some measure restored tranquility to it —no trade however was stirring there, owing to the Communication between that place and Bagdat being stopt by the arabs, and the Chaub having blockt up the river by three of his Gallivats, and it was thought that should the Persians appear before the town, it must be surrendered—Coja Petrus had some thoughts therefore of endeavouring to send the Hon'ble Companysjeffects to Coja Marcar at Bagdat, under the care of Coja Ezekiel their Shroff, if it appears that an invasion of Bussora is really intended by the Caun. The Ormus Gallivats it is said are also out, and take every Boat which they meet in the Gulph. This intelligence though we do not place an entire confidence in it, makes us particularly regret our long detention at this place, which the necessary repairs to the Euphrates Ketch have unavoidably occasioned, we hope however that we shall meet with no further impediment to our Voyage to Bussora— we shall use the utmost expedition, and in case we find that Bussora is in danger from the Persians, our first care shall be to secure our Hon'ble Master's property by shipping it on board on the Renenge &amp; Drake—the latter arrived here the 23rd ultimo.

The town appears in a most ruinous condition—the Dutch factory seems to be the only tolerable habitation, and most of the inhabitants left the place through fear of Tachey Caun who with a large body of troops is said to be very near—the Muscat fleet joined by the Ormuse Gallivats have burnt the two Gallivats which belonged to Gombroon, and the former is now at Julphur, the Shaik of which place is in alliance with the Imaum the Bounderick and Doorack Gallivats it is said are lying at Congoon and Messieurs Beaumont and Green are at Bushire. Mr. Latouche by order of the Agent wrote a letter to them at Schyras advising them of our arrival there, and desiring they would endeavour to meet him at Bushire—desiring them also to acquaint the Vacheel that the Agent had a letter for him from the Governor of Bombay which he would send when he could procure a good messenger, and that he would have wrote to him from hence, but could not procure any one to translate his letter—Mr. Latouche's letter is delivered to the Shaiks Son to be forwarded by the first conveyance. Sailed from Gombroon. Reception at Arrived in the evening at Bushire, Shaik Nassir the Governor sent off one of his people to invite the Agent on shore and to offer his services—The Agent wrote him a letter of compliment on the occasion, requested pilots for the Bevenge &amp;ca, and a writer to translate a letter which he wanted to write to Carem Caun. The Agent nob being able to procure a Persian Writer and Shaik Nassir being very pressing for the Agents landing in order that the application for Messieurs Beaumont and Green's release they being still at Schyras might be no longer deferred. Mr. Abraham, went on shore with the Governor's letter to Carem Caun, to deliver it to Shaik Nassir and to request that be would dis patch it to Schyras with all expedition, and that he would make the Vackeel the proper apologies for the Agents' not writing himself, the Shaik received Mr. Abraham with great politeness made many professions of attachment to the English, and hoped that the Governor and Council would restablish their factory at Bushire, when pressed to know whether Messieurs Beaumont and Green were on their way to Bussora according to a promise made them by the Caun after evading an answer for some time he confessed they were not, and that they would not be released until a present was made—Coja Aviat the Armenian who assisted them at Schyras and is now here informed the Agent that they were well treated by the Caun. Aga Cutcheek, a merchant of Persia, and Shaik Nassirs attorney remained on board the Eevenge whilst Mr. Abraham was on shore. On the Shaiks, his own and other merchants account he agreed to purchase 300 Canisters of Sugar from Commodore Nesbiit at 8 rupees per maund Tabuze, but only 124 were delivered to him, as he was not able to collect money sufficient to pay for the whole.

CCI. Mr. Moore the Agent's letter to the Pasha of Bagdad, dated the 12th January 1774. I benefit by the first conveyance that offers for Bagdad, to inform vour ^tura ■n n c jji - i . i 'to Basrah-Wretched Jjjxcellency or my return to this place under the 5th instant, and at the same condition of the time to assure you I rejoice not a little at finding had escaped the Plague ftolf'1w.rTo which during the course of the last twelve month has been inflicted on your pS ?' Ve88el8 for Excellency's dominions ; Your Excellency can be no stranger to the dreadful havock it has made in this City in particular, the inhabitants almost all dead, those few that are remaining quite dispirited, and some of the principal merchants amongst them, preparing to leave your Country for ever, they are induced to this not only from their apprehensions that the Plague may again break forth, but from the oppressive and injurious treatment that they inform me they have met with from the Government here during eight months in which I have been absent, money extorted from them by imprisoning their persons, and other proceedings shocking to freedom, and human nature, but more particularly so at a time of such a general calamity as the late Plague may be considered. Your Excellency is I hope a stranger to the proceedings in question, indeed I am confident you could not hear of them, otherwise they would immediately have been put a stop to—the Merchants here all look up to me as their protector, and implore my influence with your Excellency. I have promised them the full torce of it, and with that promise their fears seem somewhat to nave subsided; Permit me to recommend to your Excellency's consideration that Bussora is a Commercial Town, and that no commerce can flourish, where the Merchants that live in it, live under oppression, with the best of Government, it will take a century for this City to recover, how much therefore it is your Excellency's interest to treat the Merchants with humanity I entirely submit to your own determina tion. The five vessels that came hither from India with me, will I hope somewhat contribute to raise the spirits of our drooping merchants, and conduce also to your Excellency's honor and interests. I am very happy in having brought with me the two which your Excellency commissioned me for, they are quite new, carry fourteen guns each, are called the ' Tygns and Euphrates*' and well calculated for the rivers that they are named after. I wish your Excellency could see them, because I am well convinced you would be pleased with the manner in which your orders have been executed. It was not in mj? power before my departure from this place in April last, to obey your commands regarding a Caravan's proceeding immediately across from hence to Aleppo; but I now intend doing it very shortly, as several mer chants are come hither with goods for that purpose, and a direct caravan will very much assist in recovering the commerce of this Country, the Merchants here also are very urgent with me to get the order for a Caravan renewed ; I Note .—In confirmity with instructions from Govt Mr. left Bombay on 28 October 1773 for Basrah \ ' ■ w ' for the purpose of resuming his duties as Agent, and was accompanied by Mr. William Digges Latccche M?. George Abraham, Mr. James Collings, and Mr. Galley. These gentlemen arrived at Basran on the 5th January 1774, when they found that the plague had disappeared. The total loss of life from this disease at Basrah and the villages around it during the period of its prevalence, was estimated at about 2,00,000 and in the whole of Turkish Arabia at 2 millions.282 tiierefore hope for Your Excellency's immediate order for tbat purpose. The Governor of Bombay directed me to salute your Excellency on his part on my arrival, and to assure you lie has great pleasure in sending you the two vessels already mentioned with wishes therefore for your Excellencys , health and pros perity, I subscribe myself respecfuily. CCIL The Pashas^ reply, dated the 15th February 1774. Asks agency to I have received the letter you wrote me and am very glad to hear of your SranHor^on 11 - 0 arrival at Bussora ; your anxiety for my health is very pleasing to me, believe coffee fleet Caravan me ^ am equally anxious for your's on account the gfeat hurry we are in to go from Baghdad, I cannot send you my usual mark of favour upon your arrival, but I will do it by some other opportunity. I am much obliged, and thank you much, for the two vessels that you have brought me from Bombay; for the proper management of these vessels I must depend on you, and my Mussaleem, and to employ them in such manner as you may think best for my interest, by which means I hope the river will be kept clear, in order that the Country may benefit. The permission that I gave you in April last, for the Caravan to depart from Bussora to Alepho, was on account of the sickness that raged at that time, and because I thought it would be good for the Merchants, but we are again all in good health owing to the providence of God, and many merchants are now here ready to purchase goods, I think that for the good of my Country, the Caravan must now be despatched directly to Aleppo, from hence—if you have therefore prepared a Caravan, I beg of you to put as stop to H that the goods may go this way. 'I beg of you to consider on some proper method of getting up to Bussora, he goods brought to Muscat by the Benishroff and Alasoor fleets, as it will conduce much to the good of trade in my Country. CCIII. Mr. Moore's letter to tfye Pasba, dated the 20th February 17 74. Threatened attack I have been honored with your Excellency's letter by the return of our Persians? h ^ the Mussuleem Soleman Aga's chocadar, and am very much pleased to find that I still possess your friendship and good opinion, you may be assured I will always endeavour to cultivate these, and to render myswlf and Countrymen agreeable to you and your Government ; Your Excellency will act regarding the Caravan for Aleppo in such manner as seemeth best unto you, what I wrote you on the subject was what I thought for the good of your Country, and for the commerce of this place in particular, as your Excellency however thinks it more for your interest that the Caravan should proceed from Bagdat, and not from Bussora, I presume to urge nothing further on the subject ; Hegard- ing the two Turkish vessels, it is not in my power to man them properly at present agreeable to your Mussaleem's request to me when I wrote for them, they had only just stores and Lascars enough in them to bring them to Bussora ; I wrote, however, yesterday to Bombay on the subject, when I receive the orders of my Superiors regarding it, Your Excellency shall be immediately acquainted therewith, in a day or two however I will speak to your Mussaleem regarding this matter I suppose your Mussaleem now283 writes you regarding a request made hy Cunm Gaun, the Vaheel of Persia, for the English and Turkish ships to assist him in his war against the Muscat Arabs a request Your JExoellency must suppose that is not in my power, with respect to the English ships to comply with ; the Vakeel threatens in case his request is not granted, to march down his force and destroy Bussora ) this intelligence is confirmed to me by a letter written thirteen days ago from Sehiras by Messieurs Beaumont and Green and received by me yesterday ; In my humble opinion therefore it behoves Your Excellency to order down your troops imme diately for the defence of this place, and give orders to the difPerent tribes of Arabs to march down to the banks of this River, to prevent the Persians from landing on this side of it—the sooner this is done the better, as Bussora accord ing to my notions is in no state of defence whatever; Was it not for my appre hensions of the Persians coming down, and of the Plague's breaking out again in the spring, it would be very easy for me to send down a Cruizer to Muscat in order to convoy up the trade from that place ; but according to the present unfavourable appearance of things, the English Cruizers I am much afraid will have other employment. CCIV. Extract from a letter from the Agent at Basrah to the JPaiha dated the 14tk December 1774. The accounts that I have received here of the hostilities that have taken place in Ooordistan between the troops of Your Excellency and the troops of Currim Caun, the vakeel of Persia, and the warlike preparations that I also learn Currim Caun is making induce me to suspect the Oaun may have some design against Bussorah. * * * * design is to embark on on the board English cruisers, with all the English gentlemen that are at present at Bussorah and continue in the river until I know the result of Currim Caun's operations. I indended also to have shipped off all the Com pany's property and the property of all the English merchants, but as your Mussaleem has informed me that my doing this would be the ruin of the place, because it would occasion all the inhabitants to leave it, I have therefore desisted, your Mussaleem, the Dufterdar and Sheikh Dervise ; having engage^ in your and the Sultan's name, amply to indemnify the India Company and all the English merchants at Bussorah for whatever losses they may sustain by their being prevented from shipping off such effects as they may at present have laying in their warehouses at Bussorah. ccv. To—The Honourable W illiam H ornby, Esq., President and Governor etc. Council of Bombay, 1 '* Hon'ble Sir and Siks, Our last address of the 16th February and the extracts of our diary Letter from relative to Persian affairs then transmitted will have informed you of the reports a/fias h nd Coanoil284. Designs of Karim an d of CarimCaun^ designs against this place being confirmed we were pre- BwSh. Bgahl8t paring to ship off our Honourable Masters effects on board the Eevengc Brake -—they were ordered under the 20th February to be stored with three months provisions, and to hold themselves in readiness for receiving the woolens—but the Musaleem hearing of our intentions, paid the Agent a visit at the factory- he represented to him the bad consequence that would attend our shipping off the Company's effects at that time—he said that Carim Caun's chief desire was to ruin Bassora, and thereby oblige us to resettle in his dominions; that this his aim would be fully answered, if the English on every alarm, would remove their effects and thereby throw the town into coniusion, that the inhabitants were already sufficiently alarmed; that numbers would undoubtedly immedi ately leave the place; and that all business would be put a stop to he said also that he had his people in different parts to give him intelligence of the Persians motions ; that they could not march without his having early advice of it, and that then we might if we thought proper take every pre caution for the security of our property. __ - , 2. He informed the Agent at the same time that he was sending a man The Kaab and ' ,, . n , m i i i j Turks. to the Chaub, who he was certain would either join the Turks should the Persians march against Bussora or at least remove with his Galivats and people from Doorack, and he requested the Agent would promise in the former case that he should not be molested by our cruizers—he concluded with desiring to know if we would assist him against the Persians, or what were the Agent's intentions should they actually besiege the place. 3. The Agent sensible of the propriety of the Mussaleem's reasoning with respect to the shipping off our effects agreed to defer it for a few days longer, by which time as the Mussaleem observed, the designs of Carim Caun might be more certain—He promised him that should he put his hostile designs into execution, and the Chaub should join the Turks in the protection of Bassora, our cruizers should not molest him—he observed to the Mussaleem that we were only merchants in Bussora; that we had nothing to do with the disputes between the Country powers, and though he wished extremely well to the Turks, he consequently could not give them any assistance—that on the approach of the Persians he would retire on board the ships with as- much of the English effects as they could conveniently take on board, that he would then wait the event, but that the Mussaleem might be assured he would not quit the river whilst the place continued in the hands of the Turks, with which assurance the Mussaleem appeared to be perfectly satisfied. 4. The Agent wrote to the Bacha to inform him of the Caun's designs, and to recommend to him the sending down troops to protect the pl ace —the Chaub when applied promised the Mussaleem not to lend the Persians any assistance, but to quit Doorack with his Galivats and people as soon as he received certain intelligence that they had marched from Schiras —at the same time he informed the Mussaleem that Carim Caun bad as yet made no preparations, that he had ordered the Chaub to send five hundred men to the assistance of Tukey Caun at Gombroon, but that the Chaub had excused himself, Messrs.Beaumont 5. Affairs remained in this situation until the 3rd March, at which time faementfat Sh^az 0 .' tlie Persian Choppara returned from Schiras with a letter from Carim Caun which is entered under that date in the Ship to Ship Diary now transmitted, as is likewise under the ^th the Agent's reply thereto—since that time we have only received one letter from Messieurs Beaumont and Green dated the 2nd and285 6tli March, and which arrived and is entered under the 19th followino'. Carim Caun by this letter appears resolved to detain them and to treat our people and ships as enemies until we afford him the assistance he desires of us—they recommend our continuing on our guard particularly with respect to our vessels, though they say that he had not at that time made any preparations for attacking Bussora; and indeed we begin to imagine that he has dropt all thoughts of such an expedition if he ever really had any intentions of under taking it. 6. The reports from Bushire of the day say that Shaik Nussir eight days ago Q r ^ e eau ^ e ° n |; t ^ nd was within two days journey from Bushire, and that he had wrote to his brother to Bushire—Maskat Shaik Sadoon to prepare the English factory for the accommodation of Messieurs Beaumont and Green who were on the road with him—Shaik Nussirs voluntary return to Schiras had pleased Carim Caun so much that he had sent him down again to Bushire in order to take the command of all the Persian Galivats, and had given him full authority to continue the war against Muscat or make a peace with the Imaum as he might think proper— the Imaum at the same time appears to be willing to accommodate matters, by his having released the Persian effects which he had detained at Muscat on his first dispute with Carim Caun, and which Chetterby's ship the Faiz Islum brought on freight to Bushire. 7. Other accounts say that Carim Caun has stopt the allowance which he made before to Messieurs Beaumont and Green to attempt to reconcile the different reports which, we daily receive, would be a most arduous task—. we only hope that the most favorable accounts regarding those gentlemen may prove true—perhaps Shaik Nassir in order to induce us to resettle at Bushire, or Coja Sarguise in order to be entitled to the payment of 5,000 Rupees, promised him by the Agent, have used their interest in their behalf and succeeded— the Agent's letter to Coja Sarguise and his answer are entered in our diary tinder the 18th February and 19th March—he bears a most execrable character, but has a most unaccountable influence over the Vackeel, and Messieurs Beaumont and Green write that they have found by useful experience that their liberty depends solely on him. 8. It is also reported from Bushire and confirmed from Greim, that Shaik Sheikh Abdullah Abdulla under the appearance of a treaty with Tackey Caun, Carim Caun's Zackey Khan. mt brother, and of a marriage between him and Sheik Abdulla's daughter, decoyed him with about Porty of his people from Gombroon to Ormuse ; that there made them all prisoners, and informed Tackey Caun that he would detain them until Carim Caun released his son whom he keeps at Schiras, as a security for Sheik Abdullas fidelity. 9. The Chaub notwithstanding he so lately appeared to be on the best Threatened attack of terms with the Turks, no sooner heard of the Paiz Islam being at the bar, SaiTflett 'aiei-tad then he dispatched his whole fleet consisting of 14 Galivats and 8 armed EnglCiT o£ boats in order to take her—but the Mussaleem had early intelligence of his motions—he informed the Agent of them and the Revenge was immediately dispatched in order to join and protect her—she arrived at the bar the 13th in the evening and the next morning the Commodore found the Chaub fleet at anchor on this, and the Paiz Islam on the other side the bar—in this situ ation they had been for three days—the Chaub's Vackeel had that very morning quitted Bassora, by order from his master, and we do suppose at the same time the Galivats had received directions to attack the Paiz Islam, but the opportune arrival of the Revenge prevented them, and they imme-I 286 diately decamped—the Faiz Islam arrived here with the Revenge the 15th and the Mussaleem came to the Factory Garden and returned the Agent thanks for the protectioa afforded her, 10. The Obaub thus disappointed seems determined on keeping no longer on terms with the Turks—All his people have been recalled from Bussora, and departed the 17th in the evening we were informed that his fleet was lying 1 at the Halfar with intentions of coming up in the night and attacking the ships—and it has been confidently reported for some time that Carim Caun has given him such directions—the Commanders therefore have had orders to keep their vessels in a constant posture of defence, and on this occasion the orders were repeated—we thought it proper to take every precaution in our power though it did not seem probable that the Galivats who appeared to be so very backward in attacking a single merchant ship should venture to engage the fleet which is here at present. 11. What his real designs may be in recalling his people from Bussora, and keeping his vessels at the Halfar we are as yet ignorant of—it is certainly in his power to cause much trouble at least in the town, and he has pretty well convinced us that he has an inclination—the Shaiks of Charrack too, and several other Arabs in the Gulph, who have Galivats or boats have lately turned Pirates, and greatly interrupt the trade to this place. 12. As Carim Caun and his subjects therefore seem determined on dis tressing us as much as is in their power, we think it would be absurd in us, whilst we wait your further orders, to keep up the communication which we hitherto have done between our vessels and the places belonging to him— the trade carried on there increase his revenues, benefit his subjects, and at the same time run the risk of our ships lying in Ports, whose friendship at least is not to be relied on. 13. We have therefore directed Lieutenant Field in command of the Drake not to put into Bushire in his passage to Muscat; we have recommended the same conduct to Captain Crie of the Saint Helena, and now likewise write to the Captain of the Cruizer which is to be at Muscat in May, not to touch at Bushire in her passage hither with the trade this year—the Pilots now on board the Drake and Saint Helena, bein» carried to Muscat will serve to bring directly to Bussora, the Cruizer and Convey abovementioned. 14 The four friends Captain Stewart now waiting at Muscat for Conv oy to this place has a large Persian property on board her—this on he: arrival at Bussora, we might detain as a deposit, until our Honor a ble Masters Servants and Vessels now in the Caun's hands were delivered up. 15. As such a step however might be considered as an act of hostility* and your Honor (fee* orders to us are positive against any hostile measures whatever, you may depend whilst those orders remain in force, that we shall not venture to take it. Your Honor &amp;c will observe however from Messieurs Beaumont and Green's letter of the 2nd and 5th March, that our Pacifick conduct towards the Persians has hitherto only served to make Carim Caun imagine that we are afraid of him, and to give our enemies as great an advan tage over us as they can desire. HyderAU'sembassy 16. Messieurs Beaumont and Green inform us in the above letter that arim Khan. Heyder Ally had sent an Embassador to Carim Caun with presents, in order to obtain a settlement in the Gulph for trading, to propose an intermarriage between their children, and in return to promise the Caun the assistance of bis ships—Messieurs Beaumont, and Green were ignorant of the result, it287 was reported however that the Caun had rejected the intermarriage, but had promised to grant Heyder Ally Gombroon which it was thought would be of little consequence considering the opposition that so dangerous a neighbour was likely to meet with from the Shaik of Ormuse. 17. The Bacha of Bagdat has thought fit in appearance to comply with Carim Cauu's solicitations, and to promise him the assistance of the two Ketches against the Imaum of Muscat, but we look on it, as a promise that will never be performed—He seems to think however that it will satisfy the Caun and prevent his undertaking anything against this place, for he has hitherto taken no measure for its defence. 18. He seems very sensible of your Honor &amp; friendship towards him in sending him so readily the two vessels which he requested, and of the benefit and security that our factory and ships are to Bussora —He consequently seems inclined to grant us every indulgence in his power, and we have great reason to be satisfied with the conduct towards us—as a mark of distinction he has sent a present of a horse and furniture to the Agent, and has granted permission at the Agents request for a Caravan's proceeding across the desert directly to Aleppo—it will depart in about a month—another has arrived within these few days from thence—and as there is no hopes of a peace betwixt the Turks and Russians being shortly concluded from a new Sultan Haleem having lately succeeded to the Turkish Throne on the death of his brother Mustapha—as there is not the least appearance of the Plague either here or at Bagdat, we have a pleasing prospect of a recover ing Commerce. 19. Under the 23rd March Ooja Abdulla in behalf of himself and Coja Beuben another few merchant made us a proposal to take off 91 bales of Cloth at the current prices, with a deduction of 9 &amp; 109 the amount to be paid in Peeul which was to be sent to Surat at the Honorable Company's risque and expense, and 31 days after the safe arrival of the Peeul at Surat, and on delivery of it to Abdulla and Reuben's order there, the amount was to be paid your Honor &amp;c Surat Rupees for Persia valued at 7 Mamoodies &amp; Rupee —Coja Abdulla and Reuben were to be permitted to dispose of 39 bales in their shops, at Bussora ; the remainder they engage to export to Bagdat, but required that it should go there in the English name.

The Shaik was further given to under stand that the Imaum's fleet was proceeding to Bussora with trade as usual, and that the Vackeel as well as the other powers in the Gulph might behave towards it, as they might judge to be most for their interest. to^srah^ 611 sent —^ ess i eurs Beaumont and Green on Shaik Nassirs arrival at Bushire reminded him of the promise he had made of sending them to Bussora immediately on his return, but he still pleaded the risque he should run of the Vackeeis displeasure by such a step. He at length however came to the resolu tion which had for some days employed his thoughts of permitting Mr. Green to proceed hither to propose to the Agent some terms towards an accommoda tion. Mr. Green accordingly arrived here under the 19th Instant. KwimKhan'^ by 5^.—-The terms proposed by Shaik Nassir to the Agent through the means of Messieurs Beaumont and Green, and by them submitted to us in a letter dated the 2nd Instant, and delivered us by Mr. Green were as follows: that a Gentlemen, or Petrus an Armenian Merchant might be sent to Bushire as temporary Resident, until the pleasure of our Superiours at Bombay could be known, and that our Vessels should trade to Bushire as formerly ; in return for which the Shaik engaged to give back the Tyger with her Stores : to make himself answerable for any piracies that might in future be remitted on our trade either by the Bunderick or Genowa Gallivats, and to restore Mr. Beaumont his liberty. 6th. —These terms could not be accepted by us consistent either with your honor, or orders. In our opinions too, the conduct which we have hitherto observed, and which our Hon'ble Superiours at Bombay have approved ; of not entering into any engagements with the Persians until Messieurs Beaumont and Green were both released, joined to the prejudice which Shaik Nassir has received by our Vessels not being permitted to touch at Bushire have been the means of procuring the release of Mr. Green; and we thought the same measures, the most likely to procure with credit the enlargement of Mr. Beaumont likewise. 7th. —The Agent therefore under the 23rd replied to Shaik Nassir as per Copy inclosed, and we are in great hopes that the Shaik will be induced, very shortly to return Mr, Beaumont to us when he finds that his detention, of so great a prejudice to his port of Bushire.

Public Department Diary No. 67—1775, pages 182—187. The letters and papers relative to the present situation of affairs in the Gulph of Persia and the rise of the difference with Carem Caun, having been pursued by all the Members; the advices from the Agency since our last general directions thither, are now read and considered, in order that we may- reply to them by the vessels now proceeding thither, and the following resolu tions are taken and orders passed unanimously. As the Drake will not take on board more than three Hundred Bales of a vessel freighted Woolens, and as owing to the detention of Eagle and success at Bussorah by Either 17 Woollens the Agent and Council unnecessarily as we continue to think it, we have at present no other vessel that can be sent on that service ; it is therefore agreed that the remainder, being about 230 Bales (including 30 Bales of Drabs which are to be sent) be freighted a board a good country Ship now bound to Bussorah, the owner of which has offered to take them on the usual terms. Since the rupture with the Maharattas ; we have been in greatest distress Detention of the for the Eagle and Success, which the Agent and Council detain at Bussorah ? ru5 1 zers there ^ r ® at ' . iy disapproved of. without sufficient grounds. For so doing it is true they had some latitude for the detention of the Eagle in case of absolute necessity is only however to be found in their advices, but their detention of the success is quite unwarrantable as they have not the least authority for it. Beside as the remains at Bussorah are no more (according to the Quirk Stock received by the Revenge dated the 15th November last) than about 1,25,000 rupees. They ought to have considered that it could by no means answer the Company to be at the charge and expence of keeping two Cruizers in the Gulph constantly to defend it, whose services are so much required at the Presidency. However positive Orders must not be sent absolutely to return hither both Positive order to those vessels, within ten days from the receipt of the letter now to be wrote rew' for their them. The bad terms we have been on with Carem Caun for some time past, The bad situation which has always been assigned by the Agent and Council as their reason for keeping Cruizers in the Gulph, and the necessity we are now under for their a8cribed services here, has again induced us to investigate the cause from whence these differences arose with the Cause of their at present subsisting, and we are therefrom the more confirmed in the opinion we gave in our letter of the 27th of April 1769, namely, that the disagreeable situation of our affairs in the Gulph was and still is, owing to the unaccountable antipathy which the Agent seems to have conceived against Carem Caun to which we may now add that the Caun in consequence seems to have conceived a similar dislike to Mr. Moore; however the necessity of our affairs now requires that the troubles in the Gulph should be brought to a conclusion, and though we can now no A ^ d the to D0 tak0ii tor longer expect the advantages from the Caun that he formerly offered to the ret;rievin g tiieDa - Company, yet we still think that a peace may be easily accomplished, so that our trade may no longer be exposed to insults from the Bundereek or any other Gallivats in the Gulph; The Agent and Council must therefore be directed seriously to set about this business, and we absolutely enjoin the Agent in particular to lay aside all personal resentment whatever and when they consider290 the vast expence that has been incurred by the Company in maintaining Cruizers in the Gulph for some years and the detriment to their interest by doing so particularly at the time, we trust that the Agent and Council will exert their united efforts to effect it.

In our last respects we informed your Honour of the defeat of tlie Persians .Threatened Per- sian attack on by the Eaoha's troops in Coordistan, we informed you also that it was generally Basrah. The Kaab expected that Curem Caun would endeavour to revenge it on the Turks either sac a8sia * by an attack on Bagdat or Bussora, and that as the latter lay more open to his attacks, it was thought they would first be directed against it. Whilst the inhabitants of Bussora were in this suspence, the Chaub's people (in revenge for the execution of an Arab of that tribe punished by the Mussaleem for robbery in Bussora, for several nights together, came up the river in small boats, entered the town in parties, robbed and plundered the houses, and towards the morning retired with their booty—the Mussaleem to put a stop to those disorders, increased his guards by a party of Arabs from Zebier, hired on purpose, and obliged the inhabitants to watch in several parts of the town; their numbers however, were too small, and the town too extensive, notwithstanding all his care the Chaub's people still committed the same disorders, they even attempted to burn the Bazar, and several times beat off the guards who were sent to oppose them. The Turks from these circumstances were convinced of their own weakness, and began seriously to consider the consequences of being attacked by the Persians and Chaub, when they were not in a capacity of securing the town from being plundered by the latter alone—their apprehensions of Carem Caun consequently increased and induced the Massaleem with Shaik Dervise and the Duftardar to pay a visit under the 13th Ultimo to the Agent at the factory. After many professions of friendship to the Agent and English in general from the Bacha and Mussaleem, after observing as a proof thereof the Bacha having directed the Mussaleem to consult the Agent on all material points in which the Bacha's interests, an. the prosperity of Bussora were concerned, the Mussaleem requested his advice on the then uncertain posture of affairs between the Turks and Persians, and the probability of Carem Caun's attacking this place. He requested to know also what were the Agents intentions, and how the English would act in such a case ? The Agent acknowledged himself much obliged for the good opinion that the Bacha and Mussuleem entertained of him and as a proof if it said he would give the best advice that was in his power. He observed to the Mnssaleem the week state of the town as well with respect to fortifications artillery or soldiers, of which in his opinion the Bacha ought immediately to be informed, and to be requested to send down as soon as possible from 3 to 4000 men from Bagdat for the defence of it. In the mean time he recommended to the Mussaleem to write to the Montific Saik to hold his Arabs in rea diness for defending the banks of the river, and to employ people in Persia on whom he could depend to give him th^e earliest intelligence of Carem Caun's designs. With respect to the part, that the English intended pursuing, the Agent informed the Mussaleem it was that of the strictest neutrality, that as soon as the Agent thought it prudent, he should embark with the rest of the English onboard the two Cruizers.

The sudden departure of this boat for Muscat affords us only time to Agent^nd Council ^ orm y ou ^ ussora was invested by the Persian Army under the 7th ins- leave the place. tant, and that under the 11th the Persian Elect consisting of near sixty sail among which were twenty-two large Galivats and Dows, having approached Bussora with intent as it evidently appeared, to join the Chaub's which was above us, we judged it the most advisable measure to endeavour at a junction with the expected vessels from Bombay. Letters from Mr. Beumont received under the above date advised us of four being hourly expected at Bushire, and we thought that their being able to make their way good to us through such a fleet as was between us and the bar was impracticable. We therefore under the 11th left Bussora, and in our passage down the river were attacked by the greatest part of the Persian fleet under the command of Shaik Kassir, who first made an appearance of waiting for us, but finding us con tinue to stand on, he made the best of his way to the Halfar, into which he retreated, and the depth of water would not permit us to pursue him : as the Galivats had the advantage of our's and would not permit us to approach them nearer than random shot, we suffered no damage in the action, and we believe their loss, if any, must have been very inconsiderable. The Persian fleet began their attack upon us at J past 2 in the afternoon, and did not leave off firing until 7, their scheme appears to us to have got our ships between them and the Chaub's fleet, and then by every means in their power have prevented our proceeding down the river. Sheik Nassir however writes to Bushire that our vessels attacked him first, and that three of our shots went through his Galivats, that he notwithstanding will continue a friend to the English and do them every service in their power. We have, H. MOORE etc., B ushire R oads; 22nd April 1775.i 293 CCXI. ' R obert G arden (Bushire Road) to the President and Governor, etc. Honourable Sir and Gentlemen. By a boat bound to Muscat, I embrace the opportunity of acquainting you with the situation of affairs in these parts. On my arrival here the 7 ins- edfy EngTis^sMps. tant, I was informed by letters from Mr. John Beaumont, that the Persians were actually gone against Bussora and that he had orders from the Agent and Bushire Settlement, rQififtsp or Bpftumoiit Council there to hurry up any cruizar that might arrive. As the Persian army etc. was encamped a little above the town, that 15 of the Chaub's gullivats, attempting to pass our vessels had been attacked by tne Eagle and Success and that one of the gullivats was taken and another burnt and the remainder had gone by and joined the camp. After maturely weighing every circumstance relative to this business, I was firmly of opinion, it was more for the Interest of tbe Company that I should instantly begin the negotiation with the Persians, and endeavor to procure the Release of Mr. Beaumont; than comply with the wishes of the Agent and Council for the following reason's— Because from the Accounts received of the forces the Persians' had sent against the the Turks' viz., 40,000 against Bagdat, and 30,000 against Bussora, besides 14 Gallivats and 50 Armed Boats from these parts, and 15 Gallivats from Dorack, it was likely that both the aforemention'd places would fall into their hands, in which case, should I not embrace the Opportunity that presented itself of accommodating our differences with Kerim Khan, not a single, Port in the Gulph will be open to us. Because should I slip this Opportunity it would be impossible ever again to settle with Kerim Khan, or effect the Eelease of Mr. Beaumont; and as Our present disturbances with the Moratta's, put it out of the power of the Governor &amp; Co. to send Cruizer's with Our Merchant Ship's, the Trade of the Gulph would consequently be entirely ruined. Because the force we have with us, is not sufficient to protect us, even should we be attack'd by such part of the Persian Gallivats as Mr. Beaumont Acquaints me has lately been dispatched from these parts : the three Merchants Vessels being so miserably Equip'd, that they are not capable of the least defence. Captains Gage and Hall who were consulted by me on this head, being also of opinion, that in the event of our being attack'd by the aforemen tion'd fleet of Gallivats, one or more of the Merchant Vessells must inevitably be taken. Because in my Opinion the Agent and Council were wrong in making themselves Parties in the present war, with which they had no business; and because if they acted as they should, they might put the whole of the English property on board the Eagle and Success, and Embarking themselves also, neither they, nor the property was in any great danger. Because the property we have with us belonging to the Company and private Merchants, amounts to near 20 Lack of Eupees, to run which into immediate danger would be madness. Because should I be so lucky as to Succeed in an Accommodation with the Khan, it would not only be the means in all probability of Overting the dismal Consequences which might otherwise Eesult from the Eash and impolitick Step which the Agent and Council of Bussora had taken ; but also of securing to the294 lettep^to ^Karhn ®- on '^^ 8 Company, and Individuals the whole amount of their property at Khan. Bussora. Thus Resolved I lost no time in Commencing my negotiations with the Persians, and Shaik Nassir being absent and Shaik Saddoon his Brother (tho' he assured me of his friendship for the English, and had sent off, Aga Cotcheke to me, the Principal merchant in the place, with a compliment of sheep ; Fruit &amp;) not having authority from the Khan to release Mr. Beaumont, or Ratify any term's that might be Agreed on between us. Immediately address'd Kerim Khan by Letter, Acquainting him that as the strictest Amity had ah antiquo subsisted between the English, and the Persian's, the Hon'ble the Governor and Council of Bombay, were at a loss how to account for his late breach of friendship in detaining the Tyger, which was surprized and taken by some of his Gallivats in Bussora River; and keeping Prisoner's two of the Company's Servants Messrs. Beaumont and Green who where taken in her. To make enquiry into the cause of this proceeding, and to rectify any thing that might be amiss (tho* they were not conscious of having given his Majesty any cause of displeasure). I had by their Order's, touched here in my way to Bussora; that as it was their wish to Continue on friendly terms with him, I had it also in Commission from them provided he would first release Messrs. Beaumont and Green, and deliver up the Tyger with her Stores &amp;c. to Establish a Factory at Bushire; that Our Ships might trade to his dominion's as heretofore, and that a Mutual Intercourse of friendship and Good offices might subsist between us.—This Letter was dispatch'd the 11th and I hourly expect an answer. Shaik Saddoon and the Merohantg here un animously Assure me, that it will be favorable, as the Khan has nothing more at heart than the Establishment of an English Factory in his Dominions; and that he could think of no other mean's of Effecting it than by the detention of Mr. Beaumont not chusing to make any further Overtures to Mr. Moore against whom he was highly incensed, and Shaik Nassir in a Conversation he had with Mr. Beaumont the night before his Departure, assured him that Mr. Moores obstinacy had been the Cause of the present war : for that had the English Colour's been hoisted at Bushire, the present Expedition would not have taken place. Agent and Council ■^ ie I^h Instant the Agent &amp; Co. arrived here with the Success, at Buahire.

One Night, however the Persian's were making an assault upon the Town, the English Gentlemen all repaired on board; and being Apprehensive that the Persian and Chaub's Gallivats when joined would be an Over match for them they set sail and came down hither, leaving the inhabitants of Bussora no doubt in the utmost rage and Consternation : for Saddoo Khan the Persian general having acquainted the Turk's, he would Accept of a certain sum of money, as a Ransom for the place they had (it is said) in consequence of the Assurances that Our Cruizer's should assist them, sent back an Arrogant Answer. Be this however as it may, by thus deserting the place they have certainly forfeited all Claim to any Indemnifi-295 cation from the Turks for the Losses the Company or Individuals may sustain : and it would in my opinion be dangerous for Mr. Moore to return even should a Peace between the Turks and Persian's now take place. The Agent and Co. however, in answer to a Letter I wrote them requesting they would inform me what steps they proposed taking in the present Emergency&gt; Acquaint me, that should Bussora not be taken by the Persian's their intention are to return; but that should it fall they meant to proceed immediately to the Presidency. On the arrival here of the Agent &amp; Council from Bussora I dispatch'd a second Letter to Kerim Khan, (requesting that should Fortune favor his Arm's against Bussora) he would send Orders to his General Saddoo Khan to take all possible Care of the English property in the place, &amp; to the same purport I wrote to Shaik Nassir who being upon the spott, and having great Weight with Saddoo Khan, will I hope effectually serve us in this Instance; unless the late firing that took place between Our Vessells and the Gallivats under his Command in passing each other in Bussora Eiver should have irretated him against us; which I am in some measure apprehensive of as in a letter to his Brother Shaik Saddoon lately received, he says Our Vessells Attack'd him first. Tho' the Agent &amp; Council declare they received Several shot from the Gallivats, before any was fired on Our part, no great damage, however, was done on either side. Enclosed you will receive a Letter from the Agent and Council, parti cularly informing you no doubt of their proceedings. This goes recommended to Narrondass at Muscat, who will forward it to your Hon. etc., by the first Opportunity. I Remain very Respectfully.

At about 2 Oolock the next morning the Persians made a desperate attack to scale the walls between the Zebene and Bagdad gates, some of them had even got on the walls, but through the bravery of the Arabs under the command of Shaik Tamar of the Montificks were repulsed with great loss on this attack we went on board the Eagle—the Persian Army then advanced very near the town, and several skirmishes took place but entirely to the disadvantage of the Persians—under the 10th at night the bridge of boats which we had thrown across the river was attacked and one of the boats burnt, and under the 11th we quitted the place as advised you in our last respects just after we left it, we saw another boat of the bridge on fire, since writing the foregoing the Agent has received a letter from Bussora by the way of grain dated the 20th Instant (April 1775) Bussora then held out and the Naquedah of the boat which brought the letter, informs us that the Pontificks and Benechalid Arabs had assembled for its protection, that the desert was overflowed, and that the town was in very little danger from the Persian Army.'

Having by order's from the Vakeel proceeded against Bussora, my intentions on my arrival at that place were to have had an interview with Mr. Moore, and to have endeavor'd to accommodate the difference between the Khan and him, and with that Intent, I anchored with the Gallivats at a considerable distance from the ships; but to my extreme chagrin, the English vessels no sooner perceived us, than they weighed anchor and Bore down upon us in an hostile manner, pursuing and firing on the Gallivats; in consideration however of my friend- - - slli P an( l esteem for the English, and to prevent the effusion of Blood; and least by any of the Persian's being killed, an accommodation might be rendered impossible, I Ordered the Galivats to keep at a distance, and res- train d their firing notwithstanding the great ardor of my men to attack the English in their Turm. Two day's after they again bore down upon us, when still actuated by the same friendly Motives, I restrained my people from going to encounter them till they upbraided me with cowardice, and impeach'd me with disaffection to the cause of my country; all this however I patiently bore with, rather than break off my former Affection, and Eriendship for the English, They continued to fire on us so long, that the Persian's threaten'd297 to mutiny, and would not any longer obey my Orders: my own men however I still kept in awe, but some of the Gallivats under the command of Meer Ally returned a few Guns; The English vessels anchord near us 24 hours, during which time my people earnestly solicited my permission to attack them, but were still kept back. The 2nd morning the English Vessels weighs and set sail, and proceeded down the River. On this the Commander's of the Gallivats went and Complaind to Saddoo Khan, assuring him they would have taken the English Vessels, had I permitted those under my Orders to act in concert; and this I still bore, and took the blame of on account of my friend ship for the English. Notwithstanding all that Mr. Moore has done, I still look upon the English, and even on him in a friendly light: if he is not posessed of the same amicable sentiments towards me, there is no help for it.

Translation o£ a letter from Mr. H enry M ooee to the Mussalim at BaBrah, dated the 18th July 1775. As a long confinement on board ship has much impaired my health and I at present see not the least probability o£ returning _ to Bussora, myself under the necessity for these and many other weighty considerations to proceed to Bombay on the ships now proceeding to that place. Messieurs Departure of Moore to the Presi dency. F. D.T 298 V Latouche and Abraham remain at Bushire, with the intention of returnino' to Bussora as soon as ever the war between the Turks and Persians is termi nated, in order to take charge of the Honourable Company's factory and effects; and I trust that your Excellency will not permit any person whatever excent Mr. Latouche and Abraham to take charge of them until my return, unless such person produces to your Excellency a Commission from the Governor of Bombay for that purpose. The Honor that your Excellency has acquired in the gallant defence of Bussorah will be remembered to the latest times. I would it had been in our power to have assisted you more than we did; but it was not, of which I doubt not but you will be perfectly convinced on maturely weighing the several circumstances before, and since, our departure from Bussora. Your two Ketches I intend taking with me to Bombay for the same reasons that I brought them with me from Bussora, if I leave them here they will certainly be taken by the Persian Galivats. My advice however to you is to send me an order to sell them at Bombay, as they will cost you much money to repair them and the Governor and Council are so much in want of their fleet in India, that they cannot spare a Cruizer to protect your Ketches nor men to man them. I once more beg leave to recommend Mr. Latouche and Mr. Abraham to your favor and protection and hope for the continuation of your freindship and good opinion. ccxv. John Beaumont to the Presidency. Bon'ble Sir and Sirs, Our last respects were dated the 13th of April and went by the Expedition which with the Nancy sailed the day after. This Packet is forwarded by boat direct to Narondas, at Muscat, who is ordered in case no Vessel should be there bound to Bombay and no boat can be had to venture over to dispatch it express by the way of Scindy to give your Honour, &amp;c. notice of the surrender of Bussorah to the Persians and the return of the Bussorah Council thither. ^ Surrender of Their address to the Hon'ble Company under the 25th of April a copy of Persians on 16th which is enclosed will inform you of the state of Affairs until then. The 3rd Instant they received a letter from Mr. Galley dated the 21st April which mentions that on the 15th in evening Shaik Dervis and the Ions went out to Sadoo Caun. The next morning the Mussaleem waited on him and surrendered up the Town, he was well received by Sadoo Caun who sent about 6,000 men commanded by his son Ally Nacquy Caun and Ally Mahomet Caun to take possession, detaining the Mussaleem and Ions in his camp. On the 21st Sadoo Caun made his Publick entry into Bussorah attended by more troops which caused some confusion to find habitations for them and for whom many of the Note .—On the 16th April 1776, Bussorah was surrendered by the Turkish authorities to the Persians, and on the 21st of the same month, Sadoo Caun, the Persian General made a public entry into that Town. At • CoosiBting oi Mr. Latouche (Agent) Mr. Galley and Mr' r ' f I,' 0 . ^ J* 6 f Abraham. Bassoia, leturned td that place from JBushirG, on th© 11th j T _ „ of the following month, and re-opened the Honourable Com pany a Factory ; In a letter to the Bombay Government, dated the 4th June 1776 the Agent in Council at Bassora stated that on their return they found the Honourable Company's Factory in excellent order, that Sadoo Cawn expressed himself willing to shew the English every indulgence, that his people had shown particular respect to the Agent in Council, and that the first appearance of things was so flattering that if they had not been acquainted with the Persian character, they would have formed a most pleasing opinion of their future prospects under the Persian rule at Bassora. * c i299 inhabitants were obliged to quit their houses but at that time they had received no other molestation nor had their property been touched that two Persians having been detected plundering they were so severely beat that one of them is since dead. Mr. Galley further adds that through the means of Shaik Nasir he had visited Sadoo Caun and was very politely received by him who had given him possession of the Pactory the 20th in the evening where everything appeared in good order and he believed that nothing had been taken out but what the Gentlemen were before advised of. This material Intelligence urged the Gentlemen to use the quickest J lie k a t ' e g C7 P roceed despatch for their departure as every moment then became precious but having considered that the Persians are not to be solicited for the merest trifle without Presents and as Mr. Galley previous to his entering the town had strongly recommended to them in a private letter the necessity of taking up a very handsome one for Sadoo Caun and one for Shaik Nassir at this important juncture, observing it was the only step to preserve the Hon'ble Company's property and English Effects there—the preparing these presents detained the Bussorah Council some time longer however on the 4 p. m . they embarked on board a Dow but were held by a contrary wind until Yesterday morning when she sailed—Prior to their going they wrote complimentary letters to Carim Caun and Mirza Jafi&amp;er which they sent under cover to Aga Husain a principal merchant at Schyras, advising them of their departure. The Gentlemen have left here the Records, &amp;., papers of the Agency not judging it prudent to risque them to Bassorah for the present while it is in such an unsettled state and as they were extremely hurried in getting away they had not time to address Your Honor, but requested we would immediately advise you of these events. They have likewise desired us to forward express any Packet that may arrive from our Hon'ble Masters for Your Honor, and at the same time give you all possible information of affairs in this Gulph which we shall not fail carefully to observe Your original Paeket for Our Hon'ble Master's P Nancy which was sent from hence the 6th April went forward from Grain the 13th by a returning Aleppo Messenger and the Duplicate was dispatched to Grain on the 27th. It is said here that on Carem Caun's receiving advice of the reduction Karim Khan s of Bussorah he ordered Sadoo Caun to seal up all the Effects in the place Araf^oast. 11116 belonging to deceased and absent Persons and forward him lists thereof—to summons the Chaub Shaik Barrakat thither and advice him of the result and to examine and send him a clear account of the country leading from Bussorah towards Muscat. It seems that all the Chaub's Gallivats are at Manowa in possession of the Persians excepting 2 or 3 out of repair at Doorack—and by the latest accounts from Grain the Inhabitants were so intimidated at the progress of the Persians that they were preparing to abandon that Town and retire with their best effects into the desert. A report likewise prevails here that the Imaum of Muscat in the event of i man . 0 f Maskat Bussorah falling was about deputing to Carem Caun a Sciad who with ^^tera^with Hyder Ally's Ambassador to the Persian Court now at Muscat are to ^arim Khan, accommodate matters between them and it is said that Imaum will then Consent to purchase a peace with an annual tribute, which we think not unlikely considering how much the prosperity of Muscat depends on its trade with Bussorah. We have had no late news of what passes at Bagdat but it should seem that Carem Caun has deceived Mustapha Bashaw as well as the Grand Signior with vain hopes of a peace for under the 22nd of Eebruary 3883 f.d.300 Consul Abotts 'writes from Aleppo that nothing was talked more confidently of at Constantinople and that it was considered by the Ministers there as certainly concluded on. Some days after Mr. Smith's departure a small parcel of silk was brought to the factory with a paper written by him mentioning that it should be delivered to Shaik Sadoon and was valued by the brokers of Bombay at E9i the Pucca Seer 3-i of which make a maund tabarer. We have kept this silk until we know Your Honour, &amp;ca. 5 pleasure regarding the vackeel's proposed contract concluding it to be part of the musters Mr. Garden took with him to Bombay. The Bussorah Council drew upon us for £6,270-3-7 for part payment of the presents and we have supplied them on that account with 10 pieces of superfine cloth 2 of fine and 10 of Perpets. Our sales in last month were 10 pieces of Perpets at 24 rupees and 2 at 22 rupees each. We enclose a duplicate of our last respects and duplicate copy of the Inventory of the Effects of John Paul Schedel deceased and are with the greatest respect. Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, Your very obedient humble Servant, JOHN BEAUMONT. Bu SHIRE ; The 6th May 1776. CCXVI. John Beaumont (BusHre) to the Presidency. Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, We request the favour of your honour, &amp;ca., to return in our names our most grateful thanks to the Hon'hle the Court o£ Directors for the very gener ous present they have been pleased to make us of four thousand (4,000) rupees each in consideration of our sufferings in Persia—to assure them of the deep sense we have of this handsome gift, and that it shall always be our first study to merit their favor—and we are to acknowledge ourselves much obliged to four Honour. &amp;ca., for having paid those sums to our attormes. The Terrible Bomb : Ketch arrived here the 15th June with Graft Freight for this place and sailed on the 18th for Bussora. T , . , th reat concern we are to inform Tour Honour, &amp;ca., that we have Sale of woolens at n is Witu ^ i! i? i i. j. Bushire. hitherto been able to make any sales notwithstanding the fresh assortment of woollens brought us by the Drab, which we consider the more unfortunate on account the^ heavy debt we have been obliged to contract on behalf of the Hon'ble Company principally to supply the necessities of the Bussora Gentle men which is running on at interest and by the enclosed Quick Stock amounts to Rupees This, however, must be attributed to the season, all trade being now at stand here, and the time for Sale of Woollens in particular seldom happens before301 September, before which the Merchants cannot vend them again, besides, those who do not reside here retire to Schiras, &amp;ca., the beginning of June and return when August is over, to avoid the excessive heat at this place. Some days after the landing of the Woolens by the Grab, the Merchants as sembled at the Factory and talked of purchasing, but we could plainly perceive by their discourse that they had combined together to give no more than the prices. Woolens formerly sold for here, that they had then no intention of buying at any rate, but came and made us those offers to prepare us against September when they hope we shall be forced to accept them. Notwithstanding this we flatter our selves that during the cold Months we shall have it in our power to clear the greatest part of the Remains to better advantage especially if it be true as we are informed, that some Merchants from Chorassan and other interior parts of Persia where Woolens are in demand who formly used to visit Bushire annually, understanding the resettlement of the Factory here, are then to come down to purchase Cloth ; should this fortunately happen as we expect, we shall be particularly careful of immediately advising Your Honour, &amp;ca of it, otherwise as a quantity of the Cloth lately sold at Busora, for the usual price as we are informed has been brought here, we are under apprehensions that we shall have some difficulty in settling for the prices of last year, and perhaps be obliged to lower them or dispose of the Perpets Separately, however. Your Honour, &amp;ca., may depend on our utmost assiduty being exerted for the benefit of our Employers. Shaik Nassir returned hither with his Galivats the 30th June, as have all the other Shaiks with their fleets to their respective bunders, who were at Bussora assisting the Persians. And Masoon Caum of Genowa and Me^rally of the Bunder- ick were lately here on a visit to Shaikh Nassir. The Gallivats of Shaikh Abdallah of Ormuze have taken a daw belonging to his own people but richly laden with goods from Muscat to Bareen and this place, and two Trankeys which came in here some days ago were chased by them almost to Congoon. It is confidently reported that he has the Vackeel's orders to seize on all Muscat Property to cut off the Communication with that place and this Gulph and MeerAlly told the Resident he had also a Phirmaund for this service but had declined it. The foregoing part of this address was prepared on a supposition that the Grab would sail from Bussora on the 20th of July. The 5th Instant the Merchants accompanied by Shaik Nassir came again to the Factory and proposed taking all the Perpets for ready money and giving silk for the whole remains of Cloth, which we could not agree to being unacquainted with your late orders on this Kind of barter—they then offered to take ten thousands (10,000) Rupees worth of Cloth pro vided we would also let them have double that value in Perpets, but opon sounding them on the prices and finding that the Shaikh took their part in endeavouring to Lower them to the old Standard, we could come to no agreement. We are sorry to acquaint Your Honour &amp; council that Shaikh Nassir is too much of a Merchant himself for us to expect any assistance from him in regard to the prices we sell for, for as he takes a third part of whatever Goods are brought from the Factory, it is evidently his interest to join the Merchants for getting them as cheap, as possible, which he plainly convinced us of in the last Conference and proves a great check to single Merchant's from purchasing of us, however, we do not intend keeping the u ^ Woolens beyond the approaching Season, but shall then sell them for the most we can.302 CCXVII. Extract from a letter from the Agent and Council to the Governor in Council, dated 22nd September 1776. SaduKhan Situated as we are at present, we consider ourselves as little better than prisoners, tlie Bussora inhabitants regard our Factory as some security to them, or at least as some check on the rapacity of the Persians, the Persians on their side are sensible that it gives consequence to their Government, that it encourages the inhabitants, to stay here, and that if they keep the Town they may reap great advantages from our trade ; it is not to be supposed therefore that they will consent to our departure, when we want to leave the place, and the policy of the present Government leads them to use compulsion when they think it necessary towards carrying the point they have in view; to endeavour to convince them that force is incompatible with commerce, especially in regard to us, might have succeeded for merly, but now would be as difficult as to endeavour to convince them of the ab surdity of their religion. We are still in the greatest uncertainty as to the Inten tions of both Turks and Persians regarding this place—advices from Bagdat dated about thirty days ago mention that Abdulla (the present Bacha) had received a large supply of money from Constantinople, and was making preparations for war, at the same time it is said that Caravans pass as usual between Schyras and Bagdat, and the Persians here report that a peace has been nearly concluded. Alleged oppression of Sadu Khan. CCXVIII. Extract from a despatch from the Agent and Council at Basrah to the Court of Directors, dated the 23rd February 1777. In our last respects of the 24th ultimo we informed you of some encroachments made on our privileges here by the Persian Government of our intentions of address ing the Vakeel on the subject, and of our apprehensions that if the Government's people were not more speedily checked, they would proceed to such lengths as to render our departure from hence more eligible than our stay here. We are sorry now to inform your Honour that these apprehensions were but too well founded the 31st ultimo, your Broker Coja Yacoob, with the women, and others of his family, were seized in their own House, and obliged by repeated beatings, at some of which Ally Mahomet Caun the Governor himself was present, to sign a bond for 6000 To man. Our Linguist sent to ask the reason of this treatment, was again denied admittance, and as all remonstrance we found would be ineffectual, we shut up our Factory, and determined on having as little communication with Ally Mahomed Caun's people as possible, until we should receive an answer to a letter which we then prepared for Carun Caun, and which was despatched to Shyras by the way of Bushire as soon as the wind would admit, or the 6th instant. In the meantime Ally Mahomed Caun's people finding that the shutting up the Factory had alarmed the town in such a manner that they were obliged to double the guards on the gates to present the escape of the inhabitants being disappointed also in the amount which they expected from Coja Yacoob, notwithstanding all their severity and beginning we believe to be apprehensive of the consequences of our complaining to the Vakeel, they gave us many hints that if we went to see the Caun everything might be amic ably adjusted, but finding these had no effect, two of his principal people at length desired to see us. Being admitted after some hesitation into the factory, they made many professions of the Caun's friendship towards us and endeavoured to303 persuade us to overlook what was past, and to visit the Caun, in which case every thing might be settled and Coja Yacoob released from the trouble in which he was Such Hon ble Gentlemen is present disagreeable and uncertain situation and we have no prospect of any change in it for the better before the arrival of a Cruizer from Bombay or of answers to the letters of the Vakeel. If the latter are as favourable as we flatter ourselves, they will be, we may yet do something in the way of trade at this place but should they not be so, and there should be as little prospect as there is at present of the town's again falling under a Turkish or Arab Government, in duty to your Honors we cannot avoid confessing, that we much fear the advantages which may be expected in the way of trade, will be far from an equivalent for the expense and risque under such unsettled and rapacious Govern ment as is the present and that the sooner we can withdraw the settlement from hence the better it will be for Your Honor as well as your interest. CCXIX. Translation of Phirmaund issued by Karim Khan to the Persian Governor of Basrah, {received on 17th March 1777). You must know that I have a very great regard for the English nation—they orders for the were always friends to this Kingdom and now are so. On this account my friendship Sec^mp^y's 11 * of towards them is very great, and I must always take notice of their situation. You Sei T ants and pro ' ^ perty. are therefore to take particular care that you behave in a proper manner to Mr. Latouche, the English Chief, and to his people : You are to do them all the good you can—you are not to suffer any one whatever to use force towards him, or the people that are in his service, or to ask anything from them. In short you are to behave to them in such a manner that he may be contented and carry on his busi ness with credit—these orders must be strictly obeyed whether he is contented, or whether he is displeased, must not pass unnoticed by us; we must pay regard to his representations. I repeat that what I now write must not be neglected or dis obeyed by you on any account. You know that the Revenues of Bussora depend on its customs, and you are therefore to behave in such a manner as trade may go on and the revenues receive no detriment. Translation of letter from Karim Khan to Mr. Latouche, Agent at Basrah {accompanying the above Phirmaund). I have received your petition, and everything that you wrote concerning the situation of Bussora, I have understood. I have always had, and still have, the greatest regard for the English nation, and I know they have the same regard to wards me. I have always experienced their friendship towards me. I have now wrote a Phirmaund to Ally Mahomet Caun, Governor of Bussora, and have ordered him to behave in such a manner towards you, and your people that you may be en tirely contended and carry on your business to your satisfaction, both you, and the people that are under you. I have ordered that no person whatever shall molest them in any shape—that every one shall behave towards them so that they may be free to carry on their business to their satisfaction. I have also wrote a Phir maund regarding the Jews and Armenians at Bussora, ordering that they shall be * , well treated, that except the Head money * Stc in original. x • J not a- place* shall be taken from them and that if any of the Jews or Armenians want to go to any part of the Gulph for the304 sake of trade they shall have liberty to do so with the Knowledge of Coja Yaooob or Coia Aratoon, these orders which I have given Ally Mahomet Cann, must be obeyed by him, and I desire that you will always depend that my friendship towards you is very great. Ordering abolition of the Basrah Agency and appointment of a Resident at that place in case it should be restored to the Turks. CCXX. Extract from a Despatch of the Court of the Direct July 17 We have lately received such advices from Bussora, dated the 24th January and 23rd February 1777, complaining much of the oppressions from the Persians on the Merchants, and subjects, as give us very Uttle prospect of the revival of Trade there, consequently an addition of servants and expenses would be only encreasing the present burthen of that settlement, for which reason we now order that Mr. Moore be admitted to a seat at the Board agreeable to his standing ; We are very apprehensive when the Persians find that the Merchants and Inhabitants have no more money, they will begin with our servants which happened some years past in Persia by which the Company were very considerable sufferers ; As the Agent and Council seemed to think that the Persians would not permit them to leave the place they applied to Careem Caun * to with- * The Persian VakeeL t • i &lt; i j x draw to Bushire, hoping by that means to obtain orders from him for better treatment which was very proper, but from what has past and having been so often deceived by the Phirmaunds, we have no expec tation of redress, and have come to a resolution to withdraw our servants from thence as soon as can be done, in such a manner, as not to endanger their persons or the effects of the Company ; the best method that occurs to us is, to obtain leave from the Caun to come to Bushire which probably he may not refuse, being under his Government; When this is effected and after staying a short time there, all the servants but one, must return to Bombay ; We now repeat our former orders never to risk more of the Company's property at Bushire than ten thousand rupees at any one time ; If Bussorah should be given up to the Turkish Government as before, we permit in such case that a Resident be sent there, but you must give us previous intelligence of such measure, that we may give orders in what manner the settlement is to be ultimately established. CCXXI. ■ Instructions of the Governor in Comal to ike A August 1778. Bushire and Basrah We now transmit an extract from the Commands of the Honorable the Court SdiSndStrftoh of Directors, dated the 4th July 1777, and received the 30th April last, by the 'Bes- Shet^g' borough' ; we should have fully complied therewith by ordering an entire removal ment&amp;ca. o{ their gervan ts 5 and effects, from Bussora did not the, circumstance of an approaching War with France render it highly necessary that one servant should be kept there for the purpose of forwarding Packets—Added to this, so long as we have a settlement at Bushire, it will be proper for the security of the Honorable Company's Property in case of accident to the single305 servant that will now be left there, that there should be another in the Gulph ready to take charge of it; We have therefore resolved to continue one of the Factors there in Quality of Resident, and we hereby appoint Mr. William Digges Latouche to that station, if his health will permit him to accept of it; We are glad of the opportunity of giving Mr. Latouche this Testimony of our good opinion, but if his health will not permit him to remain in the Gulph, we have thought proper to appoint Mr. George Green to the Residency of Bussora, unless Mr. Beaumont should prefer it to Bushire in which case we have given Vn'm the option and in either case, we have appointed Mr. Green to the vacant Residency ; Mr Latouche must accordingly on receipt hereof take charge of the Honorable Company's Effects and Property at Bussora as Resident and Messrs. Abraham and Gaily and Mr. Robson, the Surgeon must return to India on the ' Eagle.' Such part of the Woollens as are not contracted for, and such of the other Effects as may not be absolutely necessary for the Factory must be withdrawn to Bushire in the manner directed by the Honorable Company, and from thence sent to India. The Residencies of Bussora and Bushire must now be totally independant of each other, and we have thought proper to fix the expences of the former (Bussora) agreeable to the following Establishment which must not on any account be exceeded. Rs. Diet money to the Resident per mensem ..... 150 4 Janisary Chouses 60 4 Factory Servants . . . . • . . .30 2 Coolees .......... 12 1 Porter .10 1 Waterman 1 Coffee Room Expences ........ 30 Stable charges ......... 30 A Linguist . . • • • • • • • .20 A Persian Writer ......... 15 An Assistant in the Warehouse . . . . . .10 Two Gardeners ■ ....... 15 Total per mensen . 389 We will admit of no larger sum than Rs. 300, being expended in one year in repairs to the Factory. We allow the Resident to purchase three horses on the Honorable Company's Account, the cost of which must not exceed two hundred Rupees each. No presents are to be given to any one, but in cases of the most absolute necessity. The Factory Guard of sepoys now at Bussora are to be returned to India by the Eagle, on which account, we have in the above statement added two Janisaries to the Number before allowed. CCXXIL Extract of a letter from John Beaumont to the Presidency, dated 6th January 1778, # * * * * * ^ * * * * * The Vakeel has ordered the Chabls to restore all the Property of the Bushire Merchants which he took in August as noticed in the copies of our306 Letters to Bussora forwarded by the Revenge but we do not hear that he has yet complied with it. Two months ago Shaik Abdullah of Ormuse was inveigled on board one of the Imum's Ships and carried prisoner to Muscat previous to which having attempted to take two or three Bushire Dows the Bushire People have lately in return made a capture of one of the Ormuse Dows but it is thought she will be given up. It is confidentially said that a peace is in agitation at Schiras between the Persians and the Turks and that the Vakeel has withdrawn his Troops from the Frontiers, which circumstance leads most People to expect that it will soon took place. CCXXIII. John Beaumont and George Green to the Presidency, 5tli February 1778, Pages 108-—109. Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, A boat offering for Muscat gives us the opportunity of acquainting you that our last respects went by the Eagle, and were dated, the 16th Ultimo since which nothing material has taken place. Four days after her Departure forty-two (42) rolls of Ghilam raw silk arrived from Schiras and were deposited in the Factory by Caja Ezar in conse* quence of which he has received our remains of Woollens and Rupees 9,666-1-9 are now due on that deposit. The Chaub has restored the property belonging to the Bushire Merchants which he took in August and yesterday two persons came hither to request the surrender of Ormuse Dow taken by the Bushire People sometime ago, which we are assured Shaik Nassir will comply with. We hear the negociation for a Peace is still going on at Schiras, but cannot learn that any thing as yet is concluded on. We are with the greatest Respect, Hon'blb Sir and Sirs, Your most obedient humble Servants, (Signed) JOHN BEAUMONT. ( „ ) GEORGE GREEN. Bushirb ; The 15th February 1778, Received 81st March P.

The 26th March having received a letter from the Bussorah Council, dated the 9th, requesting that should the Drake bring any Woollens from Bombay for our settlement that we would not dispose of any part of them until they advised us further regarding them as they were to be included in the contract the Gentlemen entered into for 1,000 bales in December evinces the propriety of our sending the Woollens by her to Bussorah instead of our landing them here as it would have been to no purpose. The merchants here having been very importunate of late for Perpets Coarse Medleys and Coarse Cloth we request your Honour &amp;ca will favour us with a supply of them as soon as possible, those being the sortments chiefly demanded here. We desire the favour of your Honour &amp;ca to oblige us with a Surgeon for the use of this Factory and hope that the severity of the hot. seasons and sudden change of the air here which frequently subjects us to disorders will plead in our excuse for this request. We also entreat for two Carpenters which we have often occasion for as there is not one to be had in the place. The freight on Treasure shipped on the Drake amounts to E367-0-3 as P enclosed manifest which being payable in India we shall debt the Agency for R275-1-8 being three-forths thereof. She has taken in no Gulff freight from hence. Nothing further has come to our Knowledge respecting the Peace between the Persians and Turks.

J).308 the Arabs, but as we are also informed that the latter was found and carried to Aleppo by some other Arabs—we do not yet despair of hearing of its safe arrival there; These unusual accidents have been partly owing to the unsettled state of the desert for some time past, to the packets being despatched from ' Grain' and to our not having by that means the power of bringing the Messengers to so strict an account as when they were immediately under the Government of Bussora, and were despatched dire ctly from Zebere—the late Eevolution here, however, having occasioned the return of those of the Zebere Arabs who did not choose to trust to Sadoo Caun's promises of protection and encouragement, we hope that these disagreeable interruptions to our dispatches to Aleppo, will be removed, and that they will in future be made with greater certainty, more expedition and less expence; To the enclosed copies of our letters * to our Honorable Masters of the 22nd Eebruary, 6th March, and 2nd April, we beg leave to refer Your Honor, &amp;ca., for the particulars of the late most favourable revolution and of the other transactions here to the latter date. CCXXVL John Beaunont to the Presidency. Honourable Sir and Sirs. The Betty Snow conveyd my last respects of the 23rd of June as per dupli cate enclosed. Deaths of Karim With much concern I am now to inform your Honour, etc., of the melan- Khan—Civil™, choly change that soon after took place here by the Tankseer people having tteTaSer peopk suddenly got possession of Bushire which they effected in the following under Reis Bagar manner. Khan. In the confusion that succeeded Jackey Oaun s death on the 14th June, Reis tiagur Caun of Tankseer, his instrument in ill-treating Sadoo Oaun's women which power he exercised with cruelty made his escape from the Camp and the 28th notice came here of his reaching Bunderick whence it seems he dispatched news to Eankseer. The evening of the 29th Reis Hamet Commander of his troops altho' blind drew out of Tankseer 2 to 300 men intending as he said to advance and meet the Caun. When they get clear of the town he led them directly to Bushire by positive orders of the Caun as it was afterwards discovered, besides having the instant before their march received advice from some of his people settled here that the two Bushire Gallivats had just sailed to go and convoy up Shaik Nassir as certain accounts were had of his being on his passage from Muscat. It is true the Gallivats did weigh their anchors that afternoon but dropt them again almost directly after on perceiving they were too late to be carried out by the ebb tide. At 2 in the morning of the 30th I was awaked with the distressing news that these Banditti had made themselves masters of the place by surprise * No copy of either of the three despatches addressed by the Resident and Mr. Abraham to the Honorable the Court of Directors, alluded to in the above extract, is in the possession of Government; the date and circumstances therefore under which Bussora was regained by the Turks from the Persians cannot be ascertained further than that it was accomplished by means of a revolution and that it took place between the 29th December 1778 and the 2nd April 1779. In the same letter, the Resident stated that it appeared to him probable that the Honorable the Court of Directors on hearing that this change had taken place in the Government of Bussora, and that there was every expectation that the Honorable Company would meet with the same countenance as formerly from the Pacha of Bagdad, would resolve on continuing the factory at Bussora ; The Resident therefore resolved pend ing further orders to retain Mr. Abraham at Bussora for the purpose of assisting him.309 without scarcely any opposition, as not above 12 or 15 were killed on either side. Por by some unaccountable negligence the town wall was that night alone left unguarded and every body asleep. Shaik Ally and the most of Shaik Nassir's people were on the event more intent on securing the Shaiks and their own families and effects on board the Gallivats whither they retired with 203 merchants and at last 300 men than in defending or attempting to recover the place which was so much weakened by that imprudent step and served to dishearten those left behind. The town was directly set on fire to throw the inhabitants into confusion and which burnt till day break consuming about 1,000 huts. All that time Shaik Sadoon kept close in his house not daring to stir out though supported by near 200 men armed with musquets when 50 brave fellows led on by a man of courage might have recovered the place, but altho* there were plenty of men ready to oppose the enemy the want of such a Com mander to head them proved the loss of Bushire containing 10,000 people to a handful of men. Fear exaggerated the number of the enemy far beyond what they afterwards appeared to be or the Town must soon have been retrieved for it is impossible to describe the consternation of every body on finding their conquerors so few. Day light presented nothing but devastation produced by the fire for not an inhabitant was to be seen in the streets, tho' contrary to expectation the enemy kept peaceable possession without hurting or plundering any one. At noon Shaik Sadoon was frightened from his house to swear jointly with Reis Hamet that both parties should remain quiet till Bagut Caun's arrival. This shameful treaty was no sooner concluded and Shaik Sadoon's person secured than a party of Arabs appeared to the assistance of Bushire, who killed 4 or 5 Tankseer people they met with at the watering place giving their horses water, which making free with and learning that the Town was eventually lost, they departed not, however without execrating Shaik Sadoon for his pusillanimity. The 1st of July Bagur Caun entered Bushire with about 200 men declaring publickly that he fled from the fear of Sadoo Caun's resentment and took possession of Bushire as a place of greater security for him than Tankseer and promised with a seeming faith that the persons and effects of every body should be sacred, adding that he would govern with the strictest justice. The inhabi tants were obliged to surrender up their arms people were employed in completing the fortifications and through his insinuating and their own fears the Moors Armenian and Gentoo Merchants here severally induced to petition Abdul Patee Caun to continue him in the Government setting forth his taking this place and his subsequent behaviour towards them in the most favourable Ugtit. The 2nd the two Gallivats sailed to the Southward in quest of Shaik Nassir. The day following all the poor native Inhabitants of Bushire were turned out of the Town and striped of everything to make room for the Tankseer families, a few of whom including the Cauns and Reis Hemets were armed previous to this one of Meer Ally's Captains having come here and demanded the late Shaik Ises family and his son they were delivered to him and he departed the 5th for Bunderick having assured me that Meer Ally so far from advising Bagur Caun to this capture when the latter was at his Bunder as was suspected and which all the Tankseer people had positively affirmed that he was certain as soon as he returned the Meer as well as the people of Genowa would repair to the relief of Bushire. By him I embraced the occasion of advising the Bussora Gentlemen of my disagreable situation.310 From that period nothing of moment happened till the 9th when three Choppars armed from Schyrash with Abdul Fata Caun's Phirmaund Command ing Bagur Caun to restore everything he might have taken from the inhabitants surrender the town to Sadoon which he was immediately to quit and repair with the Choppars to Schyras or to stand to the consequences. Finding the country were all up in arms and great preparations making to attack him both by sea and land, apprehensive too that Troops and Schyras would soon follow the Choppars and that he should be shut up in this place with not above 500 men and no possibility of escaping but above all possessing that his own people desert him if he continued much longer here, since most of their families were left exposed to the Arabs, were reasons that led him to restore on quitting Bushire. The day after serving the boats he dispatched them to one of his two Forts near the sea laden with the spoils of the Shalks to the value it was said of 3 or 4 lacks of Es. chiefly belonging to Shaik Nassir, having plundered none other of the principal people—and the 11th at sun rise to the inexpres sible joy of the Inhabitants he peaceably decamped with his people to Tankseer taking the Choppars with him after some of his Rabble had broke open and strip'd a few shops in the Bazar having held the Town but 11 davs. There were we most providentially delivered from the power of a Rebel who sure of losing his life if taken might through despair have been driven to every act of cruelty and it can hardly be doubted but this happy escape from such imminent danger will cause the Shaiks not only to use the necessary means for preventing the Town being surprized in like manner in future but to render it more secure than if this misfortune had not happened, more especially since by the Tankseer people's own confession they had made two such attempts in the cold weather but returned on being assured by their spies that the inhabitants were prepared for them and the third time when they succeeded, Reis Hamet first sent 3 or 4 successive parties into the Town who having all informed him the gates were open, the wall unguarded and everybody asleep, he h as in the Town before any one knew of his coming except some of his people residing here who betrayed the place by giving notice of this carelessness and who fired the Town the moment of his entrance but since its restoration they have every one turned out of it. During Bagur Caun's stay he forced the merchants to pay him their arrears of Customs amounting to 30 of 40,000 Rupees, and I was obliged to follow their example in making him and his principal people presents to the value of between 3 and 4,000 Rupees by his giving me to understand that he expected it, which I hope your Honor, etc., will approve considering my per plexed situation. He likewise plundered and destroyed to the foundation every house belonging to the Arabs in revenge for the hostilities committed by their Tribe in his country, for they no sooner heard that he had fallen upon Bushirc than making Shaik Nassir's cause their own they acrose, pillaged, laid waste and all in their power depopulated Tankseer and other villages under his Government sparing neither age nor sex and continuing these barbarities till Shaik Nassir's arrival put a stop to them. A Camp was formed of the allies near Tankseer which the middle of July consisted of almost 3,000 men, the Arabs having been joined by the people of Dashistan in general besides con- siderable numbers from Bunderrich and Genowa commanded by the Meers Ally Gunnos and Heyder. * Ihe l-th two Bunderick Gallivats come to our assistance as did one from Genowa the 16th when Shaik Sadoon proceeded to the Camp at the solicitation311 of the Arabs to head them and give a sanction to their operations. Masoon Caun of Qenowa also joined them about the 22nd from Schyras. The 26th the 3 last mentioned Gallivats sailed to meet Shaik Nassir and returned with him. The 31st accompanied by Shaik Sagur of Alharam with his two Galliyats and Shaik Nassor of Barein with his own and the two Bushire Gallivats making together a fleet of 9 Gallivats and 5 or 6 Dows. One of the Jmaun's ships came with the Shaik as far as Alharam when she sailed for Zebarra. But 2 Dows laden with Bushire property having separated from the fleet off Gombroon for want of water were tak^n near Kishme by the GaUivats belong ing to Shaik Abdallah of Ormuse. Shaik Nassur engaged the Caun of Verdistan to assist him with 1,000 men, who joined the allies the beginning of this month and the 7th Shaiks Nassir Sagur and Nasoor repaired to them when the whole forces being upwards of 4,000 men with 5 or 6 large cannon laid close siege to Bagur Caun in his principal Fort. On receiving news that near 200 men in 7 boats were came from Taury (between Congoon and Alharam) to the assistance of Bagur Caun and were landed at his lort near the sea the 12th, three Gallivats sailed thither to intercept their return and stop the landing of further reinforcements. It is certain that Bagur Caun depended much upon succour from the Chaub whom he solicited soon as he got possession of Bushire and altho' the Chaub was then engaged in a.war with the neighbours wherein he had greatly suffered he testified his readiness to aid him by sending him a Trankey with 50 men for that purpose which having touched at Delume near the close of July and learning that the Caun had quitted his conquest they returned to Doorack. Some days ago Bagur Caun having come out of his Fort and consulted with Masoon Caun, Meer Ally and others the 24 upon the promise of those Chiefs for the security of his person, he visited Shaik Nassir promising to return the day after and throw himself upon his mercy by surrendering up his Forts people and effects to him which failing to perform caused a suspicion that he was seeking an opportunity to escape or at last but trifling with him as he used to seize these occasions for conveying provisions into the Fort which the Shaik connived at. The 26th however he came again to Meer Ally and sent the Sbaik a very false account of the effects taken from Bushire at which time some of the Genowa people who had a demand of blood upon him persuaded the Shaik to let them cut him off which they effected while he was sitting with Meer Ally and with him fell 15 of his people besides 25 being made prisoners who were saved by the Shaik they having accompanied Bagur Caun thither and were his Chiefs and some of the best men he had. The day after bis small Fort with another under his Government at Haram were given up to Shaik Nassir and yesterday Reis Hamet surrendered himself and the large Fort to the Shaik ; which I have the pleasure to acquaint Your Honour, etc., puts an end to the troubles in this neighbourhood. Upon the whole this disaster having befallen Bushire may be attributed to the unfortunate concurrent causes of Shaik Xassir's absence and Carem Caun's death with its consequences for could the latter have been foreseen the Shaik would not have quitted Bushire and Bagur Caun was doubly guilty in taking it since he had promised to protect it agreeable to the Shaik's recom mendation just at his departure and the moment this event reached Schyras Choppars were dispatched to every part between Congoon and Gomboon to assist the allies against that Rebel they might have had any forces from Schyras 3888 F. D.312 which they declined as those soldiers are too apt to prey upon those they are ordered to assist. To the Arabs the Bushire merchants are indebted for the preservation of their property as well for their sudden retreat of Bagur Caun for their quick invasion of his country left him no secure place to convey the effects to had he plundered the Town and obliged him to hasten to the protec tion of Tank seer. I cannot, however, close this subject without expressing my best acknow ledgments for the friendly concern shown by the Bussora Gentlemen in my behalf who, I am sensible, did every thing in their power for my relief by writing letters to the Cauns of Genowa and Bunderick as well as to Bagur Caun besides sending an Armenian merchant to Carack as also one of their factory servants hitherto my assistance. Soon after Zackey Caun's death Ishmael Oaun, who was said to be the original cause of the disputes betwixt Zackey and Sadoo Caun; was taken and slain together with his eldest son Sadoo Caun entered Schyras the begin ning of the last month. Before which period Abdul Fatee Caun having dis covered that his brother Mahomet Ally Caun was conspiring to cut him off the latter has been confined to his House ever since and the intended executioner put to death. It is now said that dispute run very high at Schyras between Abul Fatu Caun and Sadoo Caun from jealousies in their joint governing nor is it thought they can be ended but by the sole power being fixed in one of them. Reports from the interior parts of Persia I am sorry to observe are not more favourable for it is asserted that Zalfahir Caun and the sons of Nasseir Caun have with separate forces our the northern provinces and the differences of the two Schyras Chiefs have hitherto prevented their taking any effectual measures to stop their progress. My last letters from Bussora were dated the 29th of July which con tained no news.

Since when everything has been very quiet here the different Troops assembled to subdue the Tankseers having on the surrender of their Forts all departed to their respective homes and those Forts continue at present under the Government of Shaik Nassir. By a Cassid who arrived two days ago from Schyras it is said that Sadoo Caun has assumed that Government on confining Abdul Fattee Caun for his intemperance with the consent of the principal people that tranquility is313 restored, trade flourishing again and justice better administered than in the time of Carem Caun no further mention was made of the Rebellions in the Northern Provinces whence it is concluded that affairs are not so bad in those parts as the former accounts represented them to be.

In pursuance to that Plan, Ally Morad Caun is arrived with his army at Ispahan waiting for the Spring to draw near to Shyras which the cold weather, and want of forage, will not admit of before April. Zaffir Caun quoted Ispahan abruptly when Ally Morad Caun came near that city, and returned to Schyras with very Eew Followers for most of his Army deserted to his Brother- in-law. In the meantime, Sadoo Caun, has imprisoned Ally Morad Caun's Family, and plundered his House at Schyras, where he is making every prepara tion against the other's approach. But as two months must elapse, before Operations can be Commenced, it is to be hoped, previous to that Period, some means may be found to Reconcile them. One of Sadoo Caun's Sons, has lately seized upon Bab an, which before, had acknowledged Abdul Fattee Caun, and it is Reported, he has encreased his Army there to 20,000 Men.

Hon'blb Sir and Sirs, Since my last respects of the 5th of February I have been favoured with lour Commands of the 16th of March, and the Extracts of the Honorable Company's Commands accompanying them. They came by the EaMe Captain Adam Shirreff, which imported here the 28th of April, and sailed on the 30th for Bussora. The 24th of that month arrived here the Ship Tarmouth, Captain William Wilson, and Mr. William Browne, her owner, and the Bombay Merchant Snow, Captain Charles Virtue, both from Bengal, and the Malabar Coast laden with Piece Goods and Gruff, chiefly for the Bussora Market. The Bombay Merchant accompanied the Eagle to Bussora, and the Yarmouth sailed thither the 8th of May, after disposing of their Gruff here. .Eajlf JtosL On the 16th of June, the Eagle oame here, to try the change of air for pSw.Up Vrmiam I,etrie ' and George Abraham, who were on board her dan 'err- 0Usly ill! beside9 Ca P tain Shirrueff alld most of the Vessel's Crew, of an Epedemi- on 16tli June 1780.315 cal fever, that raged Tiolently these Heats at Bussora, and proved fatal to many. Mr. Abraham, was at his own particular request brought ashore that night and it is with much regret I relate, that he languished here only till the night following, when he departed this Life. It pleased God to give a favourable turn to Mr. Petrie's Fever, not however tiU it had reduced him to the Brick of the grave whence his recovery was so exceeding slow from entreme weak ness, that he found himself totally unable to return to Bussora, and was there fore obliged to be left here on the Eagle's sailing thither the 22nd with the Captain, and her People, in a fair way of recovery when Mr. Petrie was under the necessity of desiring Mr. Latouche to forward the Packets committed to his charge for the Honourable Company. The 26th of the same month, I received per Down from Bussora a Packet for lour Honour &amp;oa., which I conclude, contains a Europe one, as the People of the Dow were ordered to put it on board the Eagle, had they seen her; in which case, she was probably to have sailed directly for India. By the Dow, came also seven sepoys for embarking on the Eagle. Salla Chellaby's ship tjie Islambole from Surat, anchored off this Port, the 10th Instant in her way to Bussorah. The Eagle having returned hither the 14th Instant, by her is forwarded the aforementioned Packet, and Mr. Petrie as also the Seven Sepoys, take their passage on her for Bombay. By her is likewise forwarded a set of Bushire general Books for the year Bushire account*, ending the 30th of April last, by which it appears, that the Hon'ble Company sustain a Loss by this settlement of Rupees 9,124-1-12 the whole charges during that time being Rs. 14,585-4-10 which Encrease, is chiefly owing to Rupees 3,789 being unavoidably distributed in Presents to Bagur Caun, and his people,' on heir taking this place and about2,000 Rupees expended in rebuilding decent apartments to reside in. The Sum of Rupees 4,385-4-6 was collected for Customs in that period; but the freight on Pearl and Treasure for India, fell greatly short, being no more than 700 Rupees ; since no cruiser but the Success Ketch, sailed from hence the Presidency in all that time. When the Ranger arrived here, I received a Naique, and five Sepoys, and her sudden Departure to Bussora, prevented my getting another Sepoy to compleat the number : But having received one from the Eagle, the former Kaique, and fivejSepoys, are now returned on her, and enclosed is a List of their names, and Pay. A terrible Earthquake a few months ago, destroyed every Building in the Earthquake at City of Tabris and its adjacent Villages, some of which, it is said, were Tabriz * swallowed up; and as this dreadful calamity happened at night, it is computed that 50, to 60,000 people perished.

Extract* of a letter from the Resident, Mr. La Touche and Mr, Abraham, to the Governor in Council , dated 15th January 1780. Bagdad having been a long time in an unsettled state, the presence of the Bacha, will possibly be necessary for putting affairs there in a proper train, and as it is the most central place of the Provinces, that are now annexed to his Government, it is probable that be will fix his Eesidence at Bagdad, in preference to Bussora, but should such, be his Eesolutions, he cannot for want of money and men put it into execution for some time at least, until the Porte should assist him in these respects, which they do not at present seem in a capacity of doing; at any rate, the Basha is so very sensible of the assistance afforded him by us, not only during his captivity at Shyras, but in procuring his late preferment, that whether he continues here, or goes to Bagdad, we doubt not, but the English in particular, will receive every reasonable indulgence, that it is in his power to grant them , The late troubles too having clearly shewn the consequence of Bussora, and that Bagdad cannot well be supported without it, we think that the Basha will shew greater attention to Bussora than has been given to it by the former Bashas forjmany years past; On the whole, from the known prudence and spirit of Soliman Basha, as well as from the great opinion which is entertained of him by the people in general, not only of Bagdad and Bussora, but of the several Adjacent Provinces, we flatter ourselves with seeing these countries in a very few years, in a more flourishing condition than before the late Troubles; The communication with Bagdad, which has for a long time past been stopt by the Ghesaal Arabs already begins to open, and not only they, but the rest of the Arabs, profess the greatest respect for, and obedience to, Soliman Basha. * In a letter, dated the 30th October 1779, the Resident at Bussora reported that he had received information from Bagdad to the e^t that Hossein the Pacha bad been dep^ by the Janizaries, and had been compelled to quit Bagdad. On this intelligence pUWr tilace as the Sutlan appointed Soliman Aga, Pacha of Bagdad and Bussora, with permission to reside at either place, as he might see fit.317 CCXXX-A. 'Extract of a letter dated the 15th August 1780, emor in Council. I have the pleasure to inform your Honor in Council that the Basha has lately gained a complete victory over tbe Rebels, who have so long heen troublesome to the Bagdad Government, that Mahomet Katteelt's son, who commanded them was killed in tbe Engagement which lasted several bours, and that Mahomet Beg whom he endeavoured to support as Basha of Bagdad, has either met wiib the same fate or been obliged to fly. This event it is hoped will firmly establish tbe Pacha in the Government of Bagdad, and induce the Ghesaal Arabs, who have so long interrupted the communication with that place, to make his submission, without obliging the Basba to undertake an expedition against him as he proposes doing, as soon as the water falls sufficiently to permit him to follow the Shaik into tbe marsh in which he has taken refuge.

No alteration has lately taken place either at Ispahaun or Sherauz. Jaffier Khan with an Army of from ten to fifteen thousand men is now at Kawsaroon; he arrived there the 22nd ultimo when he immediately summoned all the different Governors of these parts except Sheikh Nausir, to attend him. The greatest part of them is already gone, and the 7th instant Sheikh Nausir sent him a considerable present accompanied by one of his Nephews which the Khan accepted of and vested the Sheik's nephew with a robe of honour Jaffier Khan's future designs is not yet known, but it is supposed he will pro ceed towards Ispahan so soon as he sha]l have collected the outstanding reve nues of these parts.

Jaffier Khan still continues Kwazaroon, but it is supposed that he will very shortly proceed to the Northward to join the Bactrians from whence he will proceed againstjlspahaun, Mahomed Khan gf Mazandiram being dangerously ill at Teheran.

It is true I might have spared the Honourable Company the charge of this present; but as the whole amounts to no more than five hundred rupees and Mirza Hossien from his high station and great influence with Jaffier Khan may have it in his power of greatly benefitting the Hon'ble Company's affairs in his Kingdom. I flatter myself your Honour, etc., will approve my conduct and I remain with the greatest respect. Hon'ble Sir, etc., B ushirb ; The 10th December 1786. EDWARD GALLEY.321 CCXXXVII. From the Resident at Bushire, to the Governor of Bombay and Council. Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, In my last respects of the 10th. ultimo of which the inclosed is duplicate, Movements of two I informed your Honor &amp;c. of Khan's Prime Minister, and sent him a present Morrison and of an Achromatic Telescope and a Thermometer ; The 21st instant I received Blggs a complimentary letter from him Jn reply in which he acknowledges the receipt of these articles, express himself very highly sensible of the favor, desires me to command him upon all occasions, and assures me that he shall ever exert his utmost interest for the benefit of the English Nation in general. By the person who brought a Mirza Hossens letter I was informed that two European gentlemen had arrived from Sherauz at Jaffeir Khan's Camp, in the way to Bushire; and the 24th instant Major John Morrison and Captain George Biggs arrived here with Jaffer Beg, a person whom Jaffir Khan sent with them to conduct them to this place. By Jaffer Beg I received a Phirmaund from Jaffir Khan on the subject of these gentlemen, a Translate of which I have now the pleasure to enclose you, also copy of my letter to the Khan in reply; and understanding that Major Morrison had wrote a letter to Jaffier Khan on the return of Saffir Beg I procured a copy of it and which is likewise inclosed for your Notice. Messrs. Morrison and Biggs left England in August 1785 and came by the route of Constantinople, Bagdat, Ispahan and Sheraz, Since their arrival here I have done every thing in my power to procure certain information regarding them. It appears that Major Morrison is in the service of Shah Allum and that he has his order to settle a treaty of Commerce with the King of Persia, and that he is in expectation of the arrival of Ghopur Beg from Delhy who is joined with him in this business. The Major is an elderly man and was formerly in the Hon'ble Company's service at Bengal, in the Military service ; Captain Biggs is a young man who appear to be travelling with the Major as a Companion. Major Morrison proposed waiting here a few days when should Shofur Beg not arrive he would have proceeded by boat to Muscat and Scindy and from thence up the River Indus or through the Guzerat Country, as he should find most practicable, to Delhy; But having been informed here of the situation of affairs at Delhy, I hear he now means to return to England again immediately by the same route he came. Major Morrison made a present of a Pair Pistols and a Telescope to Jaffiers Khan, and to Mirza Hossein he gave a pair of Pistols. Though Mirza Hossein in his letter to me did not take the least of the arrival of the abovementioned gentlemen at the Camp I thought it would be proper to send him the purport of my letter to Jaffier Khan on their subject; and a copy of my letter to him is also enclosed. Your honour, etc., may depend I shall keep a most watchful eye over all the proceedings of Messuieurs Morrison and Biggs, and give you every informa tion on their subjects that shall come to my knowledge; and should they attempt to persuade the Khan to comply with any measures prejudicial to the interests of the Hon'ble Company in this Kingdom, I have every reason to hope that I shall have it in my power to render their endeavours of no effect.322 Jaffier Khan departed from Kauzaroon the 17th instant, and as the winter season is commenced it is supposed he will defer his journey to Isphaun till the Spring Mahomed Khan of Mazanderan till remains at Teheran. The Panther Snow Captain Charles Pickett which arrived here on the 3rd instant on the evening from Bussora is now despatched to you and I remain with greatest respect, Hon'ble Sir and Sirs, Your very obedient humble servant, EDWABD GALLEY.

Although for the reasons you give us we approve of the Present you have made to Mirza Hussein Jaffier Khan's Prime Minister, and hope it will have the effects you expected we desire that, in future you do not put the Hon'ble Company to such charges without our express permission. You will do well to keep an eye over the motion of Major Morrison and Captain Bigg until you are better acquainted with the real object of their journey into Persia; and acquaint us with what farther you can discover respecting them by a future opportunity.

Fight between the Extract of a letter * from Mr. Samuel Manesty, Resident at Bam ah, to the Governor in Council, dated 20th February 1787. Some months ago Hoodjee Soliman Beg who is the Shaik of the Tye Tye^A^bs'and 'the Arabs, a very powerful Tribe in the vicinity of Bagdad, and who with his Turks. * in a letter dated the lOlh October 1784, Mr. Latouche stated that he had received a corcmunioation from the Honorable the Court of Directors, giving him permission, in reply to an application he had made to that authority, to proceed for the recovery of his health, either to Bagdad, Aleppo, or England; Under this permission Mr. Latouche left Bussora tor England, vid Bagdad, and Aleppo, on the 6th November 1784, and made over charge of the Residency to his Assistant, Mr. Manesty. Mr. Manesty remained in charge of the Bussora Res'dency from the 6th November 1784, to the 7th March 1786, when he was relieved by Mr. John Griffith who had been appointed Resident in succession to Mr. Latouche. Mr. Manesty was at the game time re-appointed AsgiStant to the Resident, with the privilege, as he had attained the rank of Factor. Sf 8 addressed from the Bussora Factory to Government Mr^ Griffith arrived at Bussora on the 7th March 1786, and on the 10th of the same month assumed cWe of his appointment as Resident at Bussora; On the 5th December of the same year, however, Mr. Griffith was compelled from ill health to return to Bombay, again leaving Mr. Manesty in charge of the Residency.323 family have resided many years at the Bacha's Court, was discovered by the Basha, to be engaged in a dangerous correspondence, with a person who for reasons unknown to me, had incurred the Basha's displeasure. On this Discovery, the Pacha immediately ordered Hodjee Soliman Beg with his family to quit Bagdad, and be seized his property there to a very considerable amount. Hodjee Soliman Beg instantly obeyed the order, retired from Bagdad with his Family to the Arabs of which he is the Shaik, and has since, openly taken up arms against the Basha and his Government; Hodjee Soliman Beg's party is a powerful one, and the Basha has sometime ago sent a considerable Army under the Command of the Kia, to punish the Bebel. Various engage ments have happened between the two Armies and various have been the accounts, which have been received of them here. About twenty days ago, the Mussaleem sent to me to inform me, that the Basha's army had gained a complete victory over that of Hodjee Soliman Beg, and that Hodjee Soliman Beg was reduced to extremities. A few days past, however, letters were received, from Bagdad, containing the disagreeable intelligence that Hodjee Soliman Beg had routed the Basha's Army and taken Prisoner the Basha of Coordistan, who had joined the Army, by order of the Basha. The above is the present state of affairs in the vicinity of Bagdad, which does not fail to give great concern to the Basha, and injuriously to affect the general Trade of this Country; Sometime ago whilst the Mussaleem and the inhabitants of Bussora were anxiously expecting to receive advice of the issue of Hodjee Soliman Beg's rebellion, a report was spread here, and which was supported by letters from many persons of consequence, both at Bagdad and Aleppo, that Hodjee Soliman Beg had been appointed by the Ottoman Emperor, a Basha of three Tails and Basha of Bagdad; The Basha himself believed that the appointment had actually taken place, he sent for Coja Marcar the Hon'ble Company's Agent at Bagdad and in his presence ordered a letter to be written to His Majesty's Embassador at the Porte, in which he in the warmest Terms entreated his friendly support and good offices at the Porte, to set aside the appointment which he supposed had been given to Hodje Soliman Beg, and acknowledged his many serious obligations to the English ; I am now happy to inform you that I have every reason to suppose that the report of Hodjee Soliman Beg having been appointed Basha of Bagdad is totally without foundation; I have not, however, received any intelligence from the Embassador on the subject; Revolutions in the Government of these countries are generally attended with so much confusion, and have generally such evil consequeifces that the report of Hodjee Soliman Beg's appointment as Basha of Bagdad, gave me considerable concern. I, however, indulged the hope, that the very Extensive influence which the English now fortunately enjoy, and the very strict freindship which without an exception they now are in with every person of consequence in the Country, might in the event of a revolution give security to the Honorable Company's Factory servants, and Dependents here, and I also indulged the hope, that Hodjee Soliman Beg in the Event of his having obtained an appointment as Basha of Bagdad, and of his establishing himself in the office, would persevere in his former attachment to the English, and still acknowledge the obligations which he has frequently confessed to be under to me for my kind attention to his Brother Mahomed Beg in the year 1785 ; I most anxiously hope that Soliman the present Basha may long hold the Eeins of the Government of this country. Although his conduct has not324 been such, as his obligations to the English ought to have dictated to him, he still feels, and sometimes acknowledges those obligations. He is really partial to the English, and by an indulgent conduct towards the Merchants,' gives more encouragement to them, than other Bashas have done ; I beg leave to assure you that to increase the credit and influence of the Honorable Company's Factory here, is and shall be my constant study; The Ghessal Arabs continue to obstruct the communication between Bussora and Bagdad by the Eiver Euphrates, the Merchants are therefore under the necessity of sending their goods by the River Tigris at great expense, and with much less of time. In consequence of the wars and troubles now existing in this country, and of the waters of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates not having risen to their usual height, during the last year, a general scarcity of all kinds of provisions now unfortunately prevails, and the prices thereof have risen in an enormous degree.

In my last respects of the 5th of January I informed your Honour, etc., of my having heard that Major Morrison had come to the Resolution of returning to England again by the way of Bussora, and the 22nd of the same month He and Captain Biggs proceeded to Bussora on the Elizabeth Snow Captain Mar shall Having been informed that Major Morrison wrote a letter to Jaffier Khan previous to his departure I procured a copy of it and I have now the pleasure to enclose for your observation : The list of officers &amp;c., referred to in the letter I have not been able to procure, no copy having been taken of it by the writer of the letter. The person who carried Major Morrison's letter abovementioned to Jaffier Khan having returned here a short time since, I made it my business to learn from him the reception it met with from the Khan. He informed me that scheme had made reflections on it by no means advantageous to the under standing of that Gentleman, and had not returned any answer to it Jaffier Khan returned to Sheraz the beginning of March, and it is said he purposes departing for Isphan about the end of this month. Mahomed Khan remains at Teheran, whilst one of his Brothers governs Isphan.

J freedom of trai should do so in safety, that they should sleep m the cradle or Security and i n Persia, confidence and that they should transact all their business, as far as in us lies, without trouble or vexation. Therefore the high, exalted Eirmana has been issued forth, containing the strictest mandates to all Governors and Commanders of our towns and castles, to all our Sirdars, and to all Riotdars, who receive customs on th e roads, that they do show every favour to all persons employed by the English nation in our dominions for the purpose of merchandize, whether it be for importation, or exportation, and that they be constantly vigilant in protecting them, and moreover that these are above mentioned servants, upon no account or pretence whatsoever, require any customs, presents or money from the Agents of the English nation, but that it may so happen that from a confi dence in us, and from a full persuasion of not receiving any insult or vexation they, the English, may be induced to pass backwards and forwards and to trade in our dominions And whenever they shall have disposed of the goods and merchandize which they may import for sale, they shall have full liberty to make their returns according to their own wishes. And it is therefore necessary that our most honoured friend, the English jj alios at Bussora, should perfectly understand that in this way, our favour is equal in magnitude to whatever he can hope or desire, and it is moreover necessary that in order to make trial thereof he should encourage his nation to trade into Persia, and he has again our word that they shall do so in the fullest and most perfect security. Again whatever goods or merchandize the English nation shall import for sale there shall be no restrictions put upon the sale thereof, but after their Agents shall have completed the sales and fulfilled the design of their journey, they shall have every protection granted them on their return, and again upon our royal word there shall be no impositions laid upon them, for if, ever, heretofore, there has been any impositions or vexations practical upon the English nation in Persia, it is our will that from this day they be abolished and forgotten. And being persuaded of the sincerity of our most honoured friend the Balios, we accept of his offer of services and request of him to purchase im mediately such rarities as are procurable at Bassora, favouring us at the same time with the amount cost thereof, in order that we may order the same to be repaid to the person who shall be sent with them. Let our friend, therefore, on all occasions rest satisfied of our favour and protection. Let him on all occasions make known to us his wishes and wants, and let the above for ever remain a compact between us.

It appears that Jafer Khan had been much indisposed or s )me days previous to his assassination, and that Syed Murad Khan took advantage of his illness, and the absence of Lutf Ali Khan, his eldest son, to pave the way for his own aggrandizement. Lutf Ali Khan on receiving intelligence of his father's deatli left his army sheikh Nasir which was several days march from Sherauz and fled to Bushire to put himself of Bushire * under the protection of Shaik Nassir, who has since died. By the assistance however of Sheikh Nassir, his son, who has succeeded him in the Government of this place and of some neighbouring Chiefs, he was enabled on the 22nd ultimo to proceed from hence on his way to Sherauz. He has been joined by Several Khans on his march, particularly Ali Mohamed Khan, late Governor of Kauzerron, who delivered up to him, Sheikh Murad Khan, brother to the usurper, and a principal actor in the late revolution, whom Lutf Ali Khan it is said had caused to be put to death. Sheik Nassir is himself with Lutf Ali Khan and his brother who are-in charge here during his absence, are in Tiourly expectation of hearing that Lutf Ali Khan has taken possessioa of Sherauz.

Extract from a letter from Mr. Harford Jones {Joint Factor at Bussora) to the Governor in Council, dated 1st January 1792. In our address of 16th October we have the honour to communicate Fight between the information tliat ' a rupture would probably take place between this Gov-^ach AraS ^ ernment and the Ohaub Shaik, in consequence of the destruction of the principal part of the Fleet belonging to the latter. Such a rupture took place on the Chaub Shaik his giving directions for the construction on the Banks of the Bussora Eiver of strong Batteries, with a view of intercepting the vessels which had after destroying his Gallivats, imported at Bussora, on their return from thence to Sea : On the departure of the vessels in question from Bussora, they were accompanied by the Turkish Fleet commanded by the Captain Bacha, and on their arrival off the beforementioned Batteries, an Engagement took place between them and the people belonging to the Chaub Shaik, stationed therein which terminated without any serious advantage on either side, the People belonging to the Chaub Shaik retiring from the Batteries to Dorah, by the vessels belonging to the Coffee Fleet proceeding to Sea, and by the Turkish Fleet returning to Bussora ; The conduct of the Chaub Shaik in erecting Batteries on the Bussora side the Eiver, and in demanding from the Bacha restitution, either in money, or vessels, for the Loss which he has lately sustained, has extremely irritated the latter, and may possibly induce * /U a matter of fact Lutf Ali Khan was welcomed by the inhabitants and proclaimed King.328 him to act offecsively against the former ; we have much satisfaction in inform ing you that during the late dispute between this Government and the Chaub Shaik, the Chaub Shaik gave very acceptable proofs of his friendship towards the English Nation, in permitting the Galiivat hired by the Resident for the conveyance of Major MacDonald from Bussora to Muscat, to pass his Batteries in the most honorable manner as on other occasions.' 166. In March and April 1791, some of the Jews residing at Bussora, behaved towards the Resident (Mr. Manesty) in an insulting manner, in con sequence of his having interfered in behalf of a Christian inhabitant of Bussora, named Risha, to the extent of endeavouring to obtain for him a fair and impartial trial .on a charge advanced against him of. COXLV. From the Resident at Bushire to the Presidency. Honourable Sir and Gkntlemen. overthrows ^thf 7 * am conceriie ^ to acquaint Your Honor, etc., that this unhappy country Za^nd )dynas t y^Lutf has again been involved in the utmost confusion by another revolution at of the coast and Sherauz and the unfortunate Prince, Lutf Ali Khan, has once again been dis possessed of the Government by his rebellious subjects. Sheikh Nassir has done, and is still doing every thing in his power to thwart the Khan. It is conjectured he was privy to the conspiracy, having been at Sherauz just before the army marched and his conduct but too well seems to indicate the truth of such a supposition. He publicly avows his • Tie Kajar Chief Ag. M.bomed. allegiance to the usurper* and has lately taken the field to endeavour to establish his autnority in the province of Dashtistaun, and the neighbouring parts. Meer Ali Khan not being in a situation at present to resist, and being in a very weak state of health, the consequence of a terrible wound received some time ago in an action with a neighbouring enemy of Lutf Ali Khan (and unable to act in person in the field) has been necessitated to deliver up Bundereeg at the requisition of the Sheikh, and to return to his ancient government of Genowa. Meer Gunnossfthe former Governor of Bundereeg who was deprived of the Government by Lutf Ali Khan has again been put in possession of it, in con sequence, by the Sheikh. Since this transaction, an attack has been made on the Island of Carrack, which belongs to Meer Ali Khan, by a force of two or three hundred men from hence and Bundereeg, assisted by two or three armed boats by sea. The Fort, which was constructed by the Dutch, being still very strong, and the person in command being a man of courage, there seems no great likelihood of its falling. Meer Ali Khan has been enabled to succour the besieged in spite of the enemy, so that there are men sufficient to defend the place against any attack of the besiegers wholly unskilled in the art of conducting a siege. Sheikh Nassir himself has lately commenced an attack upon Khisht, defended by a small Fort, and governed by Leal Khan. The place : 1329 being strongly situated, and its Governor a man of approved courage and firmly attached to Lutf Ali Khan, there is little expectation of the Sheikh^ success against it. Ever since the revolution took place, all mercantile communication between Sherauz and Bushire has ceased, and it is easy to conceive the vast detriment commerce must cause consequently have substained although many revolutions have happened of late years in this country, not one has been attended with such injurious consequences to its trade. Owing to the stagna tion of trade money is extremely scarce, and to add to the list of evils, every kind of grain and provisions, are uncommonly scarce and dear.

Mr. Manesty likewise wrote to dingy 3 for his Sbeekh Culphan, the Governor of Muscat, to assist me in getting it forwarded. But it so happened that when the Packets arrived no vessel could be got on account of the lateness of the season, till after some consideration and with the advice of Sheekh Culphan I waited on a Major Mr. Donald who a long time since left Cochin in a boat to go up to Sucy but being unable to reach that place proceeded here and told him of the Packet having been sent to me to forward to Bombay with haste, and that I could get no vessel to carry it he immediately agreed to take it himself in his own boat, it being the circar business and I accordingly have dispatched it by him, as well as a Packet which came with him accompanied by two men from Siscruin the Company's Broker at Mocka the men also embarked in Major Mr. Donald's Boats. I hope your Honour will acknowledge the receipt of these packets as law those beforementioned to have been sent you altogether making five in order that I may inform Mr. Manesty of their having arrived safe. I have to request the favour of a pass and an English Colour for my Dingy Ransore Passa, the granting of which very much oblige me you will I trust continue favouring me with your co mmand this way. CCXLVIIL * Translation of a letter without date from the JPasha of Bagdad to the Governor of Bombay. Complaints against The great friendship, good will and cordiality which have ever subsisted Swfth'drawn to ^ weeI1 me an( * t ^ e English Gentlemen are confirmed. The integrity of my Grane. *In March and April 1791, some of the Jews residing at Basrah behaved towards the Eesident (Mr. Manesty) in an insulting manner, in consequence of his having interfered in behalf of a Christian inhabitant of Basrah, named Eisha, to the extent of endeavouring to obtain for him a fair and impartial trial on a charge advanced against him of having murdered a Jew, instead of his being condemned on some ex-parte evidence which had been adduced by the J ews before the Mussaleem. Threats of personal violence were made to Mr. Manesty by the Jews, with an intimation that if he further interfered in behalf of the accused, they would cut down the Honble Company's Flag Staff. These threats, however, were not put into execution. The accused was summarily convicted before the Mussaleem of the crime imputed to him and was sentenced to suffer death. The Mussaleem however in consequence of Mr. Manesty having interfered in behalf of the accused abstained from carrying the sentence into effect. The Jews subsequently in the presence of the Mussaleem, and other officers of the Turkish Government apologised to Mr. Manesty for the insults they had offered him and which apology Mr. Manesty accepted. Subsequently however Mr. Manesty received information that one of the principal Jews at Bussora had written a letter to the Minister of the Pacha at Bagdad in which he had spoken in slighting terms of Mr. Manesty; On receiving this information Mr. Manesty called upon the Mussaleem to render him justice for the insults he had on the above occasion received from the Jewish Community (for which they had already apologised and which apology had as above stated been accepted by Mr. Manesty) by expelling the Principal Jew of Bussora, who had written the letter to the Pacha's Minister, and had also taken a conspicuous part in the insults offered to Mr. Manesty, from the Town, and by punishing ten other Jews by fine, imprisonment, etc. The Mussaleem refused to comply with this application on the ground that atonement had already been made to Mr. Manesty by the apologj he had accepted; Mr. Manesty therefore made a similar requisition on the Pacha of Bagdad. The Pacha after enquiring into Mr. Manesty's complaint, ordered the 'Principal Jew' to be sent from BaBsoia to Bagdad, in order that he might be there punished. The Pacha ordered the Mussaleem to admonish the other Jews who had insulted Mr. Manesty, but refused to inflict any punishment on them. Mr. Manesty remonstrated against this decision, but the Pacha refused to afford him any further redress. Mr. Manesty and Mr. Harford Jones (who had been associated with him as a 'Joint Factor' at the Bassora Residency from the 20th November 1788), came therefore to a resolution, which they carried into effect on the 30th April 1793, to withdraw from Bussora, and remove to 'Grane' in the Persian Gulf, pending further orders from Government.331 conduct and the great respect, which from motives of friendship I have till this day shewn to the English Residents, Passengers, and the Merchants of your side, are too veil known to need any explanation from me. You must likewise be informed how friendly, attentive and Civil I have been to all persons dependant on your Circar. But Mr. Manesty the present Resident of Bussora, is a man quite ignorant of either the means of pleasing, or conciliating, his manners and conduct are bad. He before gave unreasonable interruption to the merchants and people of the Town, and some times occasioned disturb ances in the Government, lately he has been more and more troublesome and unmindful of the rules of friendship, has repeatedly caused uncommon disagreements. Although by submitting to such interruptions and disturbances I trust my own Government, and tho } conduct of this nature has a tendency to weaken the administration of the Town, yet on account of the friendship sub sisting between the Ottoman and English Courts, and of my regard for the English nation, I have forborne noticing it; Two years ago a Christian not a Ryat of Bussora, or under the protection of the English Eactory, or any way connected with Mr. Manesty had a dispute with one of the Jews, whom he unjustly murdered. The Mussaleem of Bussora was desirous of having the matter enquired into, and to have judgment passed according to the all bright Law, but as Mr. Manesty then unacquainted with the Christian, who was living under contribution in the Town, took his part, the Mussaleem declined putting the Law in execution. Notwithstanding this attention in the Mussaleem in giving the matter up Mr. Manesty was still dissatisfied, and demanded that as in the dispute, abusive language had been made use of towards him by the Jews, for his own satisfaction, as a person of character, that the Head Jew of Bussora should be turned out of the Town, and that the rest should be punished, disgraced and fined; from the desire that there should be no interruption to our friendship. I attended to his demand, and ordered the Head Jew of Bussora to Bagdad, and punished and adminished the rest but to impose fines on, and harass the subjects without cause, must be destructive of good Government, and till this time none of my officers have ever acted so unwisely, they were therefore not fined on this occasion. Mr. Manesty finding that his wishes had not been wholly complied with was offended, and quitting Bussora, went to Carrack, leaving the dispute as it was, till the opening of the season, that when the crops were ready for gathering he might throw impediments in the way of cutting them, his doing which form the friendship that has subsisted with so much cordiality between the Ottoman and English Courts, for upwards of thirty years and the harmony that has so long continued between me and the Company would be highly improper ; My fair conduct and actions towards every one dependent on the English, towards you, and his people, from a long time back, to the present day have been fully known, and it is also known how contrary his conduct has been to the rules of friendship. I have never been deficient on my part, or ever will in observing a friendly line of conduct, but while Mr. Manesty continues to conduct himself as I have above described, you must be sensible that his resid ing at Bussora, in future would be improper, and of no use, and that it would neither tend to your benefit or mine, his continuing there. 1 therefore hope you will recall him and send another Resident in his room to whom from our cordiality and friendship, I will shew every civility and attention in my power, and in all respects act for the increase of oui good understanding.332 CCXLIX. Extract of a despatch from the Court of Directors to the Governor and Council Bombay, dated 15th April 1795. MaS/sconduot. Having taken into our own consideration the advices and Papers on Kwy r aTd 0Val tlie sub j ect of tlie dispute between the Pacha of Bagdad, and the Resident Jones ' and Pactor at Bussora, we are of opinion that so far as respects their interference with the Mussaleem in behalf of Risha in the affair of the murdered Jew, their conduct was highly proper and praiseworthy. But that after the satisfactory apology which was made to Mr. Manesty by the principal Jews in the presence of the Mussaleem, and other officers of the Turkish Government, and which was deemed by the Resident an ample atonement for the insults which bad been offered to him in his public capacity, we are much surprised and greatly displeased that he should have been induced by any private intelligence from Bagdad respecting a letter written by the Jew Caja A1 Bulla, to the Pacha's Minister, containing improper sentiments and expressions regarding him, to renew his determination of demanding justice and satisfaction from the Pacha for those insults for which an atonement had been already made and accepted. To this evident want of judgment and foresight may be attributed all the subsequent disputes and embarrassments which terminated in the removal of the Company's Factory from Bussora, and the appeal which Mr. Manesty has since thought it necessary to make to His Majesty's Ministers for the final settlement of the disagreement between the Resident and Pactor and the Pacha of Bagdad. It is on this ground and because there appears no probability of restoring Harmony between the Pacha and Messrs. Manesty and Jones that we have resolved upon the removal of the present Resident and Pactor. We therefore direct that you select from among our covenanted servants fit and proper Persons to succeed Messrs. Manesty and Jones, as the Company's Resident and Factor, and that they proceed to Grain without further delay. As we are convinced of the necessity so strongly pointed out in Mr. Manesty's late Despatches of the speedy return to Bussora of a Resident and Factor on the part of the Company it is our direction that immediately after the arrival at Grain of the Persons you shall nominate to those stations they address a conciliatory letter to the Pacha acquainting him that disapproving of some parts of the conduct of the late Resident and Factor towards His Excellency, we have removed them from their stations and appointed others in their stead; and that in order to maintain the good understanding which at present so happily subsists between Great Britain and the Sublime Porte and to shew our inclination to meet the wishes of the Pacha in this respect, we have determined that the punishment of the Jews by fine and imprisonment shall no longer be insisted upon, as the condition of the return of the Company's Resident to the Bussora Factory, provided the Pacha will perform the promise he has made, of making such a return by every public token of respect to our natiom If in consequence of this application to the Pacha, he shall renew his invitation for the return of our Resident and Factor, they are immediately to accept thereof, and endeavour by every means in their power to cultivate the friendship of the Mussaleem, and other officers of the Turkish Government should the line here drawn for the guidance of the new Resident and Factor fail of producing the desired accommodation, they are to state all the circum stances to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, who will be instructed by His Majesty s Ministers how to act in consequence.333 CCL. Translation* &gt; of a letter from He Governor of Bomlay, to the Facha of Bagdad, dated 4th November 1795. The great proof you have given of your wish to be on terms of Friendship Ee -establinhmmt ot with our nation, by having invited Mr. Manesty to re-establish the Eneliah ba wy relati0M • xn i • &amp; - between Pacta and factory again at Bussora has given me more satisfaction than I can well Manesty. express; Mr. Manesty has written me a particular account of his reception at Bussora, which was such as may to be expected from a Friend. As Mr. Manesty is desirous of going to England, I have at this propitious time sent Mr.-Crow to relieve him, who I have desired to cultivate your Friendship, and to whom I have no doubt you will shew every attention, I hope you will at all times favor me with Friendly letters giving an account of your health and command me as your friend. CCLI. Extract from the letter from Mr. Bamsay, then Secretary at the India House, to the address of Mr. Manesty, dated the 1st January 1796. The Court of Directors have received your several Letters to the 9th of Orders for removal October last, and I am ordered to express their satisfaction at the establishment Jones revoke^* 1 of the Company's Factory at Bussora, in consequence of the final adjustment of the long depending dispute with the Pacha of Bagdad, and it is peculiarly pleasing to them that your return to that place, in your Official capacity, as Resident, has been distinguished by every possible mark of respect to our nation. As a perfect reconcilation has happily taken place between you and the Pacha, of which there appeared no probability when the Court com municated their orders to the Government of Bombay of the 15th April last, for a new arrangement of the Residency, and as they have every reason to be satisfied with your general conduct, and that of Mr. J ones, in your collective capacity of Resident and Factor, they have been induced to revoke the orders contained in that despatch for your removal, there being a possibility of this, reaching you before those orders shall have been carried into execution. CCLII. From the Bombay Government to Mr. Nicholas Hankey Smith; Resident at Bushire. Having been informed by the Resident and Factor at Bussora that there ai ovements o{ are two Frenchmen of the names of Bruyere &amp; Olivier, who arrived in January to^wShed 111160 * On receipt of the above despatch Government (on the 15th September 1795) appointed Mr. Nathan Crow, then in Bombay, Besident at Bnssora, in succession to Mr, iVianesty, and Mr. Peter LeMessurier, Joint Factor for that place, in the room of Mr. Harford Jones, with instructions to proceed to Grane, and assume charge of those appointments with all practicable expedition. Mr. Harford Jones had, however, intermediately proceeded to England, Overland, on account of ill health. On the 29th of the same month however (September 1795), Government received a letter from Mr. Manesty, dated the 8th August, reporting that a Turkish officer of very high rank was then on his way to Grane having been deputed by the Pacha from Bagdad on a Mission to the Eesident to solicit his return to Bussora, and in the event of his agreeing thereto, to escort bim to that place. In a further letter, dated the 18th August Mr. Manesty reported the arrival at Grane on the 9th of the same month of ' Ismael Effendi,' the ' Turkish officer above alluded to, with a letter from the Pacha to the address of Mr. Manesty couched in the most kind, friendly, and conciliatory terms,' inviting him to return to Bussora, and promising that in the event of his dping so, the ten Jews who had insulted him should be delivered up to him (Mr. Manesty) by the Mussaleem ' for peisonal chastisement and imprisonmentMr. Manesty accordingly agreed to return to Eussora, and left Grane for that purpose, on the 26th of August (1795), Mr. Manesty arrived off Bussora on the 2nd of the following month, and two days afterwards made his public entry into the Town, and re-hoisted the British flag at the Company's Factory ; Mr. Manesty stated that he had been received by the Mussaleem in the most friendly, and honorable manner, and that the promise of the Pacha had been fulfilled of delivering up to him the ten Jews above %Uuded to, for punishment.334 last at Alleppo with a design to penetrate in the assumed character of Naturalists &amp; Botanists by the way of Bagdad through Persia into India.

Honourable Sir, You have written that three men are staying in my country and forward ing intelligence to the Erench Government inimical to the Hon'ble Company. It must appear evident to your affectionate and friendly heart, what authority or abilitys single man residing here can have to send information* As from former times the chain of friendship and amity has been so friendly established between our sircars that by the blessing of God as long as breath remains in the body the garden of love and unanimity will be kept fresh by the water of affection and sincerety for this reason the friends of the JELon'ble Company are mine and their enemies mine. Having therefore in view our ancient friendship and considering our countries as one between which there can be no difference I hope you will frequently favour me by friendly com munications of your welfare and commands. CCLV. The Hon'ble Grovernor.to Narrotnm Ramchunder Jossy, Broker at Muscat. I have received your several letters of the 13th October, 18th November, 15th December, 31st January, 19th February and one without date, and am very well pleased with your attention to Messrs. Ramsay and Elphinstone, and Messrs. Johnstone and Gardiner and at the assistance you mention to have respectively given to those gentlemen, all your charges for which have been duely honoured as well as for boat hire, &amp;c. Having allowed in particular336 800 Rupees for the passage of Messrs. Ramsay and Elpinstone on your Bhingy Bhorsingar. I am very sorry that your exertions have not been able to recover any part of the Hon'ble Company's coffee that was on board the Fyiz Kadree. Respecting your application for importing salt into Bengal, were it not contrary to the standing and confirmed Regulations of the Government of that Country both the Governor General and I would be willing to gratify you in this respect, but as the confining the importation of this article from Muscat to Calcutta within the present limited quantity in each vessel has already been attended with considerable difficulty and as the granting a priviledge to you as the Company's Broker which we have not been able to allow to the Imaum himself and to all the Arab merchants might justly afford ground of jealousy and offence to the latter, which as a servant and well wisher to the Company you would yourself, I am persuaded, wish to avoid I must therefore request of you to dispense with this request and to show you that it is only from a view to publick expediency that it is not complied with, I hereby settle upon you a salary of one hundred Rupees a month which you may take credit for and draw for annually or from time to time, as you think fit, and which you shall continue to receive as long as you prove deserving of it in promoting the Hon'ble Company's and the English interest at Muscat and by opposing by every means in your power the proceeding of their enemies such as the French and Dutch during the present war, concurring which you will endeavour by every means in your power to prevent these Nations' ships sailing to and from Muscat under Arab and particularly the Imam's color to whom and to the Gulphon I have by this opportunity written on the subject, and you must join with the Company's Officer who Commands the present ship in procurring suitable answers in compliance with my suggestions on this important subject, for it is not surely proper that our enemies should derive protection from the flag of our friends and yet that such has been the case appears from your letter of the 13th of October above replied to but I firmly rely on your exertions to seeing so great an impropriety put an end to. The packet that you dispatched by October of Mr. Manesty from Bussora as mentioned in your letter of the 15th December arrived safe and the freight has been paid as has also the receipt for Rs. 561-2-0 granted by Messrs. Ramsay and Elphenstone, and the further packet forwarded by Mr. Manesty thr6 you by your letter of the 31st January has likewise come to hand and the freight on that account also has been paid, and the letter you forwarded from Mr. Smith at Bushire has also come to hand as likewise the 3rd packet from Mr. Manesty mentioned in your letter of the 19th Pebruary the freight and Enam for which as you specify the same has been discharged on all future occasions of this kind of your having dispatches to forward from Bussora or otherwise, I rely on your using as much ecconomy in settling for the freight as possible, without however delaying the dispatch of the packets which you are always to consider as of the first consequence, and omit no opportunity of letting me hear from you whether you have packets to send or not, giving me constantly all the news of Europeans or others m your quarter or whatever you may learn or hear from Bussora. In writing to the Imam and Culphan of the French and the Dutch ships having his flag I have been careful not to say any thing that can lead themS37 even that this information came from you and as I shall always he equally guarded in not exposing the source of my intelligence you may in this confidence always keep me advised with equal freedom and truth of whatever concern the English interests that may come to your knowledge. Bombay, 25 th March 1797. CCLVI. The Hon'ble Governor, to The Imaum of Muscat, I have had the honour to receive your letter without date mentioning the . . firm friendship established between you and the English, and which it will Dutch ships at ever be your wish to maintain all which has given me great satisfaction and S' as 1 have the utmost confidence in what you have written and rely on the sentiments, intimated in your friendly letter as exhibiting a faithful picture of the cordiality and sincerety of your friendship for the Eon'ble English East India Company and the British Nation, I do therefore the more readily take this opportunity to advise of my having learnt from several quarters that some vessels of the Erench and Dutch with which you know we are at war, have during the late year (particularly one or two Dutch ships trading to and from Batavia) been at the port of Muscat, under Arab Colours which from the unfeigned and well established amity between your and our States prevents our ships of war from attaching and distroying those vessels of our enemies when they meet them at sea and thus tends to promote the safety and interest of our enemies which as I am sure is not your intention. You will therefore I am convinced by the pleased with the present intimation of the subject to you and give such orders as may in future prevent your friends the English suffering from the real attention they wish at all times to pay your flag by not allowing it on any account to be in future granted to our enemies, but on the contrary assisting us in counteracting their inimical designs by which from day to day there will be an encreased and corroboration of the friendship that has long so happily subsisted betweeifi the two Sircars and which it is so much my own earnest wish by every means on this side to promote and consolidate. This will arrive by the opportunity of the Commander of the Company's Cruizer the Viper, which will proceed from Muscat to Bussora and by her I hope to have the satisfaction of hearing from you and that you will by every other occasion make me happy by communications of your welfare. Bombay, 25th March 1797. CCLVII. Translation of a letter from the Broker at Maskat, to the Government of Bombay. ELon'ble Sir, Tipoo Sultaun's Vakeel resided here for the last twelve years during which ri poo Suitao'g time he has always had a factory. Had It been a thing of yesterday, I should certaioly have made you acquainted with it; Five or six vessels under Mmri'i'o. a ° d Tipoo Sultaun's Colours come annually to this port a circumstance which I have never as yet written about for which neglect I must request your forgiveness and will in future keep you informed of all ships that come here.338 In your letter you also make mention my having written you Hon'ble Sir, that an American vessel had been here ; respecting which you say I have been misinformed as the vessel belonged to Tipoo Sultaun and the Captain's name was Crouch, and also of your having heard of a ship called the Sultaun Buksh having been here and sailed from hence, and of your being displeased at my having neglected making this known to you, and also that it is incumbent on me to give you immediate information of everything that passes with a view to promoting the Hon'ble Company's Interests. In a former letter by the Ship Elizabeth Captain Risely and Supercargo Mr. Tod, I particularly informed you Hon'ble Sir of everything since which in the month of Assa or October I wrote you by a Dingey, of a vessel called Latokinu commanded by Captain Crouch having come from Batavia and disposed of her cargo and also of another Ship which was cast away Nutcheree and commanded by Mon. Monoron who died at the place but whether you have received that letter or not I cannot say. Whenever any vessel belonging to the Company come here I never iaif to e^ive you the earliest intelligence thereof and if I have neglected in any instance doing so I must request of you Hon'ble Sir to pardon such inattention and will in future in all times keep you informed of whatever vessels may arrive here. Having previous to this written to you a Dhow belonging to the Calipha all the particulars of the ship Latchmi and also sent you a letter from the Imaum, I hope you have received the same, and are acquainted with the contents. The Latchmi Captain Crouch having disposed of her cargo of their place, has prepared for taking her departure for the Mauritius Zorafse Husson Abdulla's boat laden with wheat from Bombay arrived here the cargo of which was disposed of to Captain Crouch but to whom it was sent I know not the Latchmi having received the above wheat on board will in eight or ten days more sail for the Mauritius. You have also desired me to keep you informed as to the particulars of the Imaum's having gone on an expedition to the Gulph. About twelve months ago a dispute arose between Shaik Sughur and Mulssa Husson bin Mahomed Munsoor and Sultaun bin Imaum which has still continued and the people of Julfar and Seid Khaish bin Imaum Brother to the Sultaun went to the Gulph, but is now returned without the dispute having been adjusted at the same jtime of an adjustment taking place I will write the particulars thereof. 27th Bee. 1797, CCLVIII. Extract from a letter from Mr. Monestey to the Presidency dated 24th May 1798. SKfS 8 1 am r0ally happy in communicatin g to Government information that Projected Turkish tlle affairs of the Eesidency are at present in a most prosperous state, and that the^WaW)isf ainS ^ 1 have not the smallest doubt of their very long continuing so. The conduct of the Turkish Government in all its Departments towards the Factory and myself, is friendly, handsome, and satisfactory on the highest degree. My influence with it is as extensive as I can myself desire—My frindship and influence with all the neighbouring Governors and Shaiks, and with the distant Shaiks in the desert, enable me to command their services on ail occasionT t 339 and the general inhabitants of the country are devoted to my wishes; In short Hon'ble Sir, I have novr attained the desirable object of those politic and prudential measures which have invariably characterised my public conduct as British Resident at Bussora ; The honor, the credit, the respectability, and the influence, are completely and firmly established, and the Nation and the Hon'ble Company, now in unequivocal enjoyment of all the advantages derivable from the possession of this valuable subordinate ; Advantages which I flatter myself, I shall be enabled to preserve to them, by the future countenance and support of Government; I have the honor very respectfully to inform you that the Basha has been forced by the recent predatory incursions of the Wahabee Arabs, which have extended even to the Banks of the Euphrates and the vicinity of Hella on that River, which Town is within 50 Miles of Bagdad to determine to march a large Army in the commencement of the ensuing 'Winter into the Territories of the Wahabee Shaik, and to attempt the reduction of the Town of Draceah his capital, and the destruction of her power and Government—This warfare necessarily renders the passage of Travellers across the Desert extremely dangerous and precarious, but I encourage a hope that the Messengers employed by me, between Bussora and Aleppo, will continue to experience the beneficial effects of the attachment to me of the different Arab Tribes who inhabit the Desert which has so long given security to the conveyance through it of the national correspondence between Europe and India. . CCL1X. The Resident at Busiiire to the Governor of Bombay. Hon'ble Sir, T bes- leave to intimate to Your Hon'ble Board that I have great reason intercourse between in n/r Maskat and to suspect the French employed in the Arab vessel that made from Muscat to Mauritius. the Gulph and Bengal which I myself know to amount to the number of 7 or 8 in one ship frequently communicate intelligence from Muscat to the Mauritus respecting the departure of English vessels from and to the Gulph with such other information as they may be supposed to collect. At the same time I have not a doubt in my own mind that this conduct on their part is encouraged if not promoted by the Arabs and proprietors of these vessels as obviously beneficial to them as long as they are allowed to do it with impunity. Two sons of mine who were in the Lanal and who were both wounded L when she was taken got a passage from the Mauritius in a Erench ^ vessel to some part of Madagascar where the Dows from Muscat and the Persian Gulph constantly go for slaves and small raflers and inform me that an Arab from the same vessel embarked with them in the Dow they cause from thence to Muscat in and that they learnt from him during the passage that he had regularly been employed to his great advantage to and from Muscat by the French to obtain intelligence and forward their correspondence. Apprehending it my duty to apprize your Hon'ble Board of the above information I have acted accordingly and shall with your permission presume the same conduct in similar circumstances. 1 Li£lV0j GtC.j (Sd.)

There may indeed be considerable ground to apprehend the contrary, if it be there, as has been recently reported by Captain Spence, of the 'Pearl, that there is now a Frenchman there, who is said to be ostensibly at least interhand in the way of his possession, by the Imaum and thro* whom two small vessels, are said to be kept continually passing and repassing between that and the Mauritius, in which case it is certainly high time to endeavour to interrupt so dangerous a channel of communication, which we confide in your best exertions for effecting ; offering in the event of the Imaum's agreeing to send away the Frenh Doctor, and to exclude all Frenchmen from his dominions during the war with Great Britain, to supply his place, if desired, by a regular bred surgeon from this Presidency; and you are at the same time to enquire whether the Imaum will consent to the Company's establishing a Factory at Muscat, on the usual terms endeavouring to procure his ascent to all these points, as well by your own immediate agreements with the Imaum, and Khelfan, to whom you have also a letter from the Governor (if necessary), thro' the assistance of your consultation with Haji Khelat, who is represented as standing in the situation of surety for the Imaum to the present governing power in Persia for the revenues that the former is said to form of the ports of Gombroon, Koong, and Duloom, on the opposite side of the Gulph, and to possess as a capital merchant and Banker very great influence throughout Persia; and as there is a report that the person abovementioned under the title of Khelfa is now either altogether out of place or reduced to small consideration and influence ; we have it to you to judge of the propriety there may be in delivering or retaining the Governor's letter to his address. 3rd. On your arrival at Bushire, you are to receive charge from Mr. Smith and to grant to the Gentleman, receipts for the treasury cash and all the articles that may be made over to you, of which you are also to transmit a List, and after you have been a few months gone and that an estimate can be made of sirams and of the advantage therein likely to result to Government, your own salary shall then be fixed in view thereto, and in the meantime you are to transmit your monthly accounts with the same punctuality, and with the like description of vouchers as you were use to at Ghazipoor, taking care to observe the utmost economy in your expences and not at most exceed the medium of the charges hitherto usually incurred at the same place as will appear from the Books there. 4ith. The great object of your appointment is the extension of the Company s European imports into Persia, and the improvement to the highest341 possible degree of their selling prices, since those of late years have noticed in Mr. Pawcett s Report proved a loss to them you are accordingly principally to apply your attention to this important point; knowing that to save the company from loss, all the articles from Europe must he disposed of, for, at least from 20 to 26 per cent the Invoice price, and we repose the greatest reliance on your zeal, and desire to distinguish yourself in the trust reposed jn you to raise the selling prices to the highest standard, even beyond the above prescribed medium, as far as circumstances may possibly admit in which case we agree that you shall be according to your former proposal already on Record entitled to our Suth of the additional profits that the Company may reap on their trade thus concluded through you, as the same shall be ascertained after an Inspection of your accounts. 5th. Besides this you are carefully to prepare and transmit as soon as ready a list of all such additional articles and quantities, of European Import into Persia as may in your opinion be likely to enter into the Company's future trade to that kingdom, stating, particularly, the medium selling prices, to the end that a judgment may here be formed of what consignments to make from the Presidency and with Indents from Europe. 6th. It would no doubt be very desirable could the Hon'ble English Company supplant as you have so laudably suggested the Russian Trade in the market o£ Persia, but to enable us to judge on the important point, it will besides the contingency of your being able or not to procure towards such a change the good will of the ruling authority in Persia, be necessary that you ascertain and transmit to us a detailed statement of the description and probable annual amount of Russian Imports by the Caspian, with the selling prices that it may then appear whether our Company can offered to undersell them in any or all of the articles of Trade they thus carry on. 7th. Your suggestions on the expediency of preventing the spread of the French Infiuenoe in Persia is esteemed by us of such great importance, that besides furnishing you with our President's letter to Baba Khan (now said to have formally assumed and been by the Turkish Government addressed according to the Royal Titles after proving victorious over all his enemies) and to his Brother Husson Kuli Khan, Soubahadar of the Province of Phars. 'We have had no hesitation in providing and committing to your charge the several articles that you have recommended for Baba Khan and his brother Hussan Khan together with certain articles to be taken also along with you for the Shaikh of Bushire and the Imaum of Muscat, trusting to your fidelity and iudgment, not to part with any of them, and particularly to the two former /whose situations seem not yet thoroughly secure), without seeing an effectiye advantage as extremely probable to arise from the made of their disposal and in short, that in all respects you will winn in the execution of your present charge your ability and faithful attachment to the Hon'ble Company. 8th. You are entitled to charge Ten per cent, on the Market price, or real necessary cost of the supplies of articles to the Cruizers, taking care to receive the Commander's Indents in duplicate, for whatever you to supply, one copy of which is to be forwarded as a voucher with your monthly accounts. 9th. And as you represent that you can hardly without loss collect the small quantity of fifty Bales of Carmenia Wool (each bale consisting of only 20 Tabriz Maunds) at the prescribed low price of 6 Rupees per maund, we authorize your supply for the first year to be of double of that quantity; relying342 4 on your probity and desire to recommend yourself for the article being of the very first quality and free from any scale or other impurity. 10th. You will take at all times the utiyiost Gave of the Qompcbny 1 s credit and of the English reputation, and of the saf ety of the property under your charge, cautiously avoiding the entering into disputes with the Country G-ovem- menti and preventing the people and sepoys at the factory either from having any, or from being injured by the natives, and hoisting the flag at such times as has always been usual, and in short acting in all things in conformity to the Hon'ble Company's Rules and privileges at Bushire and in the other parts of Persia after of the several heads of which you have informed but which we have to you to attend to the peaceable improvement of circumstances may admit. 11th. In every letter you will write the particulars not only of your management but of the state of politics in the countries around you, as far as the same may come to your knowledge, without interfering in any shape in the disputes among the Country Powers farther than may prove eventually requisite to counteract the French or Dutch influence in Persia or for the purpose of seizing on and sending hither any French or Dutch man with their papers that may during the war attempt to pass, through or settle in Persia, or many of the adjoining Countries to which your influence may reach. You will also keep up a friendly correspondence with the Resident at Bussora, and act in concert with him in all points of necessary business that may occur particularly as far as regards the political objects referred to in the latter part of this Paragraph. We are, etc., (Sd) JONATHAN DUNCAN. in Council. Bombay, c 5 Ix Srd September 179$. CCLXI. Resident at Bushire to the Governor and Council, Bombay. Hon'ble Sir, Eevolntion at ^ ^ with extreme regret I inform your Hon'ble Board, that another revolution has happened at Bushire; particularly so as five months have now elapsed since Hossein Khullee Khan with his army took possession of the place. A force suddenly again appearing before the place under the command of a Persian Officer and Shaik Mahomed, brother to Shaik Nasser, and seeing no prospect of tranquillity here, for some time to come determined me to retire with the Hon'ble Company's, and my private property to Carrack till Bushire became permenently settled or that I could be assured of such support from your Hon'ble Board as my incoherent situation requires my reasons for wishing to take this esteps were the result of mature reflection and such as appeared to me from a retrospective of the subject by far the most * A nephew of Seikh Nasir. expedient. Saikh Khaunnum* during the prepotency of his authority in every instance assidionsly endeavoured to promote my wishes and made an offer to deliver the island of Carrack entirely up to the Company, at the same time3^3 he determined to defend Bushire to the last extremity and if ultimately obliged to evaquate the town to destroy it by fire, and embark on Board of one of his Dows for that island; but my principle motive for wishing to remove Carrack was that a greater expenditure for donations would probably incurred if Saikh Khunnum's opponent took the place, than by my withdrawing from it as I intended, till the storm of faction had at least a little subsided. Accordingly I had hired a large dow and exported almost the whole of the Hon'ble Company's and my private property on board of her with an English Flag and intended the next morning to have embarked myself; but in the interim Shaikh Nasser with the fleet of Benee Attaba Arabs infested the place by sea and we became completely blockaded. The first boat of this fleet being considerably ahead of the rest behaved in a very hostile manner to the dow waiting to receive me by boarding her, striking the English Elagand plundering her of several articles, but on a representation of this conduct to Shaik Salem in command of the boats he expressed great contrition for what had happened and made the aggressor to return his booty except 2 bags of tin the property of the Hon'ble Company and four or five bags of rice my private property which were lost overboard or destroyed in his precipitation to accomplish his inimical designs before the arrival of the rest of the Elect. The Benee Attabs having previously taken Carrack and delivered to Shaikh Nasser, I was obliged to relinquish every thought of retiring thither and his illiberal, and pusillanimous jealously made him adverse to the plan, I therefore again landed everything from the dow except the tin and rice, having disposed of the former to be delivered (every previous risk and expence on account of the Hon'ble Company) to the purchaser at Bussora and the latter amounting to 130 gunnies Shaik Salem requested me not to land alleging, it was his and to Shaik Nasser's determination that no provision should be imported while they were beseiging the place, therefore I was obliged not only to pay the freight of it to Bussorah but must lose considerable by its sale. Your Hon'ble Board will I hope consider that I undergo enough in other respects in these disturbances without allowing me to suffer the loss of my private property and hard earned subsistence, and altho' I have never received, solicited or expect, your favour you will surely not refuse the grant what .iustioe demands. But the return to the event of the contest after sustaining a siege for five days, and obliged to drink water little better than the sea on the night of the 20th, the enemy were disposed by the great guns of an entrenchment they had thrown up before the place. Shaik Khaunnum attacked a small party and took possession of their works. They were however, soon after attacked and in their to obliged to retreat. A reinforcement was sent out to support the fugitives, but the contest become so unequal in numbers that they were also obliged to fly and being pursued to the walls of the Town some disaffected person in charge of one or the gates, threw it open, and both parties entered indiscriminately altogether- such a panic immediately seized the garrison Shaik Khaunnum after every ineffectual exertion in which he displayed great courage, actively and per suasion to make their men sally and recover their loss was obliged to save himself by flight, and ihe conquerors plundered the town till the morning. Scarcely a hoube escaped being stripped and it was with greatest difficulty with the Residency sepoys and my own threats that I fustrated the several attempts made upon this old ruin, inviting cn every side an easy access.344 The success of Shaik Nasser's party which nothing hut his paternal affluance secured him was as sudden as unexpected aud happening in the night, all the factory servants had retired to their own houses and were plundered of even the shirt on their backs as they have nobody else to look up to in the misfortunes I have supplied them with clothes and hope your Hon'ble Board will reimburse me this expence and the loss of great part of my own cloths whicU were in the bands of the washerman. I also distributed provisions to the servants, and Shaik Khaunnum left the place indebted to me 300 piastres. I beg leave to iterate my solicitations for a reinforcement of sepoys as absolutely necessary to defend this old ruin from the attempts its appearance seems to invite with impunity to the mostly rabble which have of late inhabited this place. I find Mr. Beaumont in a letter to the President in Council dated 5th February 1780 in representing the damage the rains had done to the building he was then erecting says £ ' many buildings have suffered greatly from the same cause which has destroyed a fourth part of this rotten factory and the rest is in danger of falling from every showerAs no funda mental repairs have since been made you may judge its present state cannot be either very convenient or respectable. I have the honour to remain, Your most obedient servant, N. H. SMITH. Bushihe, mn Settlement of affairs at Mask at. The broker Narotamdas' opposition. CCLXII Translation of a letter from Mehedy All Khan dated the 26th of Rebbyessany of 7th of October 1798.- In thirty days I reached Muscat and after interviews with Sheik Khelfan and Sheik Seef who came and visited me, I have settled all the Company's business as the Governor desired. I have also obtained a Factory for the Company at Muscat; and the expulsions of the French and others have also taken place; but there still remains altercation respecting the Coulnama or deed of engagement, the Company's vakeel opposing and not suffering to take place the Company's business should have effect in which conduct he is not doing wrong for his own interests, which must severely suffer by the agreements taking place for the Company's having here a fixed Factory. Since my arrival here letters having reached this far from Europe by the way of Bussora at a time there were two Arab vessels just setting out for Bombay, this vakeel or broker instead of availing himself of that opportunity at the necessary cost of perhaps twenty Rupees, purchased a Boat for 700 Rupees and placed therein twelve sepoys, 10 Marines and 1 Tindal for two months and paid them their wages, which amounted to somewhat less than 200 Rupees, and dispatched them to Bombay and charged the Company 2,500 Rps. and as the boat itself is become his own property he has thus for about 200 Rupees really laid out, charged his employers 2,500 Rps. which I request you to report to the Governor. And from fear of this Broker lest he might venture to open my despatches and become thereby acquainted with everything I have not written to the Governor anything of the situation of Muscat or of its connection with the French because (the Broker) might thereby produce the Government's345 Interests but I shall fully report all particulars on leaving this, but this much you are to represent that if it please God I shall write fully by another letter, of my having settled everything, and I hope then also to send the Imaum's Cowlnama under his seal. Eut they will never suffer the English Elag to be hoisted at Muscat, which receiving at the source of much mischief I have desisted from. Everything else is and will be adjusted if this vakeel will only CCLXIIL Bomlay Castle, 29fl dctoier 1798. Eesolution of the Governor and Council.

CCLXIV. Translation of a letter from Mehedy Ally Khan written on the 3rd of the 1st Jemady on the 14th of October to the Governor of Bombay. Under the auspices of the Honorable Company, and of your good fortune, The Couinama whatever the views of Government were at Muscat, have been attained and f M 0 aT kat some what more, as will be rendered evident to you and to the Council by the letter from the Imaum and the Coulnama he has entered into. I say nothing of the various efforts to gain even small points, that the English Gentlemen have hitherto failed in the attainment of at this Place, whilst, in the space of ten days I have obtained, and fixed their rights at this Place, to what they were before this never entitled, as will be, certified to you by the Voucher under the Imaum's Seal; that I again repeat that whatever has taken place, has been the effect of, and induced by the Government's happy auspices^ * The Coulnama printed in Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. XI. 2578 P. D. *346 KoproYision fot a |.^ e reg ^ j for two reasons, see meet to urge tlie Establishment factory at JWaskat. - of a factory for the English Company at Muscat 1st Because from days of old, the former Imaums have stipulated with ail the Europeans, that if a factory were conceded to one, it should be so, to all the others, whence the ministers here allege that, as soon as an English factory should be set on foot, imme diately thereon, the French and Dutch would on the footing of the ancient Engagements, demand a similar indulgence which being contrary to their (the Muscat Government's) views to comply with; the refusal would, they argue entail a War on them, so as to expose the Muscat Trade to capture wherever their ships should be met with, observing thereon, that if such was neverthe less my object, 1 should first give them in writing that from the date of the fixing of an English factory, whatever expense the Muscat Government might be put to in hostilities with the French and Dutch, and whatever ships of the Muscat People, those nations might carry off at Sea, the Company should in consideration of all this Loss, arising from the Establishment of their Factory indemnify them to the amount thereof, besides which that, in the event of the Muscat Ships being occupied in fighting with those of the French and Dutch or should from fear of them, the Imaums, and his subjects' Vessels not be able to venture out of the cove of Muscat then must it be incumbent on the English shipping to supply the Muscat country the proper Denomination of which is Omaun with what it wants of Bengal Rice adding, that if the Company would undertake for these two points, they should not scruple to involve their country, and their persons, and interests, in a hostile struggle for a year or two, with the 2 nations in question; But as I considered all this, as the source of further mischief, as knowing how probable it was that the Omanion subjects (Omaun being, as above noticed, the name of the Muscat Country) would make no difficulty to value their Loss, by the capture of the first ship, at 10 or 20 lakhs of rupees, I have therefore dropped, for the present, the matter of a factory but it was my wish, that an English Gentleman, and a Gomashta of mine, should remain here, and who whilst they might carry on some Trade, and Business, should also, be in the way of communicating Intelligence ; and the Imaum did also agree to this, and has even given me full authority in all his concerns, saying that he had no objection to whatever I saw meet; but after I had departed ; the Company's Broker, over set this, and Impressed the Imaum with the Idea, that by there remaining any English Gentleman at Muscat Constant disputes would be Kept up; and altho' the Imaum did not quote the Dellol, as the author of this suggestion, Still I was forced to acquiesce in the objections, that he afterwards urged. „ .. , I learnt in the next place, that the applications of the French and Dutch .rrovision for a . . . factory at Gomb- had probably reached the Imaum, thro' this same Dellol, to let them have factories in the Port of Gombroom on the former footing, offering in such case, to make good to the Imaum what he had to pay as Revenue on that account to the Sovereign of Persia ; and at the same time to allow all the income or profits to remain with him so that had my arrival here happened a month later, it is probable, that they would have succeeded in their designs; but now that the Imaum, and his counsellors have imbibed adverse dispositions to those nations and been fixed in amity and favourable Regard towards the English Government. I therefore applied to him to have an English factory at Gombroon, and having fully accomplished that point I have now left it subject to the approbation of your Government.347 Sir, the Dutch have now a factory still standing at Gombroon, tho'perhaps the sum of ten thousand rupees would require to be laid out in its repairs, whilst the English, and Erench factories there, are altogether in ruins, nor is there any likelihood of advantage derivable for these two or three years, to come, in tbe re-establishment of our factory there, but should a lac of Rupees be expended there in a good fortification, mounting thirty, or forty Guns and with three or four Companies of Sepoys, and 8 or 10 English Gentlemen the ^ first advantage certainly resulting would be that all fear of the French or Dutch making any settlements in Persia, would be done away, and the second that considering the uncertainty and revolutions, to which the Kingly power in that country has all along been exposed, the Company's being in possession of such a strong hold must powerfully tend to enable them to avail themselves of circumstances to extend their Power, as far as may be convenient, and desir able, having also the advantage of the local native Governor there, being the Company's friend, but if a Plan of this kind do not suit you, it may, without injury, be waived and suspended for the present; we having the Cowlnama or written Engagement at our disposal, it being also, worthy of consideration that were an agreement to be concluded for it, with the King of Persia, in the first place a large acknowledgment might be annually required, without there being, at present any likelihood of effective returns, whilst the expense of defence, and 8 of repelling the attacks that might be generated from the anarchy in the country would rest on the Company; whereas every thing now rests on the Imaums. Heretofore the Eulers of Persia had differences there, with the English, but he, who is now in the governing charge thereof, is himself as it were a foreigner and stranger so that he could not act as others have done. The Post of Kharek might also, be obtained but an account of the War fare, between Sheikh Nesr and Sheikh Ghanim, much mischief and trouble are likely to ensue, which Gambroon is not exposed to. The determination rests now with you. I have sent the Imaum's Epistle, and Coulnamah enclosed in this letter by the bands of a native Persian, to whom I have engaged to pay 60 rupees, on account of the freight of the Boat, and his victuals, which I have done, in order to guard against the Dellol's opening perhaps, the present dispatches, and becoming apprised of their contents; but I have forwarded in an other letter the answer from Shaikh Khulfan, and entrusted its transmission to the said Dellol. Be pleased. Sir, to consider that what has been here effected has been but the work of 10 days, during which I have so insinuated myself with the Ministry here, as to have been generally authorized over their own concerns ; you must no doubt, conceive that so much is hardly to be accomplished without large expenditure, which if Government shall be pleased to indemnify me in, Let there be, also, included therein the Sixty rupees, the reward of the aforesaid messenger, or otherwise in like manner as for the good, and advantage of Gov ernment, I have expended 2,820 rupees, rupees two thousand eight hundred and twenty, my vakeel will also pay these sixty rupees, all further particulers I shall write after my arrival at Abusheher. If you chose to continue the present Dellol, it is well, or otherwise, let a letter be addressed to the Imaum to this effect, that, as you have committed the charge of all the business of that quarter to me, he is therefore to consider whoever I may name as empowered348 to act on the part of the English after which I will settle matters, or otherwise the Evil will continue as it bas hitherto done. Ramchunder Nerotum is dead and his Gomashta is now carrying on business in his name. The imaum 's The Imaum bas the following objects, which he has committed to me to request. represent. • First. —That in like manner, as he supplies the Honorable Company's ships with water, and firewood without price; his own ships may experience the like hospitality at Bombay and Calcutta. Second. —That as each Arab ship is permitted to import at Calcutta one thousand maunds of salt, he requests that to his own vessels, this Privilege may be extended to fire thousand Maunds, so to make a Distinction between him and his subjects. Be pleased therefore to signify whatever may be advisable on these Points, that I may, also, be enabled to gratify him. And let the Boat now sent be supplied with water without cost, as being what I have agreed to. The rest depends on you. Let Mr. Manesty be written to order all the vessels on their Return to Bombay, to make Bushire in their way, that my Letters may also reach. The other Letter which I have sent thro* the Deilol of Government has been so worded, that if it should be opened and shewn to any one; yet it will im part nothing, and therefore its answer depends on your pleasure, and therefore I have entrusted the present Dispatch to a Native Persian. Translation of a letter from the Imaum of Muscat, to the Governor of Bombay. I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter from which I have reaped much satisfaction. As to the expression of your astonishment, that my ships should go to th© Mauritius, I have to say in reply that the cause, of their so doing is this that on account of my friendship with your Government the French have taken and do still continue to make Captures of my ships, and of those belonging to my subjects, and I have accordingly in view to one they took last year; sent one of my vessels with a Letter desiring them to declare, whether they be inclined to enter into a State of Warfare, with this State, or not ? or otherwise to restore the Captures; should it have happend on the mere grounds of suspicion hitherto no answer has been received. For the rest, I have heard every thing from the Nawab Mehendi Ally Khan and have also fully imparted to the same Gentleman, whatever is the State of things here, and in consideration to his extraordinary intelligences, Wisdom, and Merits in like manner as he is come here, with the full Power from you, to carry on what concerns, the English Sarcars, business, so have I also vested him with full power to act on behalf of mine and whatever he has as a well wisher to both states deemed advisable; he has signified, and according thereto hath a writing been passed, whilst the objects on this side, have been left to his representation, and to your civility and you will no doubt do what is right and proper, I received also the articles of Rarity, that you transmitted which have been tended to the encrease of regard God preserve you in his holy Keeping.349 CCLXV. From the Governor of Bombay. To The Right Eton'ble Earl of MorniDgtooj K.P., Governor General in Council at Fort William. My LoiiD, We have much satisfaction in communicatiog the enclosed copies of the Reporting the pro Translations of Letters from Mabedi Ali Khan, and the Imaum of Muscat AU d Khaii? f Mehdl to the address of the Governor, accompanied by a Translate of a formally executed Coulnama or written engagements under that Prince's seat to exclude as our employers how we believe much at heart all prejudicial influence of the French at Muscat, and eventually to facilitate the establishment of a respectable English Factory at Gombroon; which last can however, be only at present desirable for the purpose of excluding the French or other European enemy; and for defeating the views which we liave been heretofore advised by Mr. Smith the late Resident at Bushire. The former had of obtaining leave to make a settlement there; but as that could hardly take place whilst the Imaum of Muscat who forms the port of the Persian Government continues our friend, there is perhaps less occasion for our pursuing the object which must in a commercial point of view, prove in all likelihood but very slow in producing any adequate returns, as far at least, as we can now judge from the information before us. Mehedi Ali Khan has been lately appointed from hence the Company's Resident at Bushire in the room of Mr. Smith and as his experienced talents of a negociator, pointed him out with best qualified person that could be employed to undermine the interest and footing which our European enemies had long known to have been assiduously cultivating with the Omanian or Muscat Prince; Mehedi Ali Khan was in consequence vested with full powers from this Government, on his departure hence on the 1st of September last, to detach him from a union which the present posture of affairs might have rendered doubly injurious to our interests; and to secure such advantages in our behalf, as he should find the Imaum willing to concede. Having accordingly stopped at Muscat on his way to Bushire, the success of Mehedi Aly's negotiations has considering the short time that has been consumed in them so far exceeded our expectations that we cannot now speak too highly in commendation of his merits. His happy outset has also given us cause to augur very favourably of the continuance of his future efforts in that quarter, which are intended, as the primary objects of his appointments to promote the influence of our Government with the different Princes of the Persian State and thereby to increase the sales of woollens and other articles on account of the Company to such an extent, as may if he ultimately succeed, render the continuance of the Bushire Factory of great Importance. To enable your Lordship however to judge more satisfactory of the benefits thus proposd, we beg leave to enclose a copy of Mehedi's original proposals on these points and of our consequent instructions to him on the occasion of his late appointment requesting also to be favoured with your Lordship's direction as to whether the Coulnama with the State of Muscat shall be ratified on our part. /M I 350 We shall also be happy to have your Lordship's instmctions on the means your Government may possess and think adviseable as to accomodating his the Imam's wishes in respect to the additional quantity of Government. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, Jonathan Duncan, etc. Council. Bombay Castle, The 29th October 1798. CCLXVI. Ifrom Mr. H. M. Smith to the Governor and Council, Bombay. Conformable to your injunctions of the 29th August and 3rd September, of ^ilrrefnaaf to Un&lt; ^ ^ delivered over charge of the Hon'ble Company's offices here the 3rd ultimo British Flag to ^- e ^ ec ^ ^ Khan but for the following reasons which I now submit to Mehedi au Khan, your Hon'ble Board I have not entrusted him with the British Flag. 1st, Because I did not conceive it my duty therefore could not justify my conduct without express orders from your Hon'ble Board to deliver the British Elag to the will of a Mussalman. 2nd. Because I could not deliver the Britisb Mag to the will of a Mussulman who may make it subservient to his pride, or interest and subject it to insult mth impunity to the dishonor of the British Nation without express orders from your Hon'ble Board. 3rd. Because I have thoroughly ascertained that the British Elag will never again receive that respect which every Englishman it is justly tenacious of when the inhabitants observe with surprise what they suppose impossible that the British Elag should be so unprecedently and strangly appropriated. 4tlily. Because the Shaik has publickly declared to me in the presence of the principle people of the place and several of the Persian King's officers that the British Elag can never be of that consequent he has always been taught to suppose it was if it is delivered to the will of a Mussulman who is com manded by the tenets of his religion to despise it as the Elag of infidels and can mentally have no other respect for it than to serve his own views and that he will be universally considered to entertain these sentiments whether he does or not and must confess them amongst his compatriots of heirs desirous of being thought a man of principles where he is to display the British Elag to the derision of every English subject. 5thly. Because I conceive it repugnant to the honour of the British Nation consequently infamy in me and disgraceful to the name of the Englishmen to deliver the British Elag to the will of a Mussulman subject to the despot of Persia in whose dominions he is residing and where he is himself a dependent on the will of a tyrant without the shadow of ability or pretentions to support the British Elag, much more to guard its dignity so sacred to every English subject. 6thly.

Because if he is a faithful Mussulman and a true observer of the rites of the Coran perhaps on other inducement but self interest at least to my351 certain knowledge in the opinion of his sect could persuade him to covet the Flag which his religion instructs him to despise and if he is negligent of the forms of the faith he professes he can of course only be considered amongst them as a profligate man devoid of any principle consequently not without disrespect to your Hon'ble Board in particular be entrusted with the British Elag.

Bombay Castle, the 23rd November 1798. * * * » 5fc With regard to the representations from Mr. Smith the late Bushire Condemning the- Resident, although the Board can, scarcely reconcile his present conduct with a SmUb^nd ordering perfect state of sanity; still as he is strongly expected at the Presidency, we a L' t'o Sdi ak shall defer taking that notice of it which it merits, until his arrival here. Kh ™- In the meantime to guard against the ill effects which may be apprehended from the recurrence of this gentleman's intemperance the Commander of the next monthly vessel proceeding to Bussora is to be instructed through the Superintendent of Marine, to call in at Bushire, and should he find Mr. Smith still there, first to offer him a passage to the Presidency, but in the event of a refusal, to compel him by force to repair on board the vessel ready for his reception. r The ?aid Commander is also, to be furnished with two British Piags which the Military Board are to be desired to provide for the purpose, and which on his arrival, he is to deliver to Mehadi Ali Khan, for the purpose of being hoisted at Bushire as well in his own presence, as that of as many ofthe Officers of his vessels, as can be spared a shore, with all the solemnity due to the occasion at this ceremony Mehedi Ali Khan is to superintend, and direct, as the Company's lawful representative, at that settlement, and to be considered, as such to the fullest extent of the appellation, by the Commander, and officers aforesaid entrusted with the execution of these orders, Mr. Smith, on the other hand, if still at Bushire it is to be received simply as an individual to be dealt with as above directed and not allowed to attend at the hoisting of the British Colours. During his stay at Bushire, the Commanding Officer Cruizer is, moreover, to hold himself, as being in all respects, as much subordinate to and subject to the orders, and requisitions of the present Native Besident, Mehedi Ali Khan, as according to the rules, and usages of the service he would be to any European Resident, being a Company's Civil Servant, besides which it is expected, and required of him that for the purpose of obviating, as far as possible, the mischievious consequences that may have resulted from the all together unaccountable conduct of Mr. Smith, the said Commanding Officer of the Cruizer be careful, and attentive to shew every respectful observance, in his intercourse with Mehedi Ali Khan and as marked are serve towards352 Mr. Smith, with view to impress on the minds of the Natives at Bushire, a full conviction of the sentiments of Government, and of their decided determination to support Mehedi AH Khan, in the station he now holds, and to guard against the sacrifice of the important objects of his mission to the unjustifiable caprice of an individual. « ^ ^ ^ $ Ordered, also that the Secretary transmit a copy of the above resolution, for the information, of Mr. Smith, positively enjoining him, at tha same time to proceed on the vessel abovementioned, up to Bussora and advising that the Commander will Lave further directions not to allow him to land, on his return when touching at Bushire. Mr. Smith is, also, to be expressly ordered to deliver over the Bushire PJag to Mehedi Ali previous to his quitting the place, as he ought, without presuming to exercise his own judgment in a point which did not rest with him. Besolved that a copy of the same resolution be trans mitted to Mehedi Ali Khan, to whom as well as to Shaik Nasser the President is requested to address suitable letters, on the occasion. Appointment of Harford Jones, Resident at Baghdad. CCLVIII. The Governor o£ Bombay to M ieza M ehedi A li K han. The Court of Directors having with the approbation of His Majesty's Ministers, appointed Harford Jones/ Esquire, Besident at Bagdad, for th e purpose of counteracting the machinations of the French, and that gentleman having written to and desired the interposition of this Government on the occasion of some differences that exist between the Baghdad and Muscat Governments, he has, in answer, been desired to write to you, on any such subjects, if they should eventually prove necessary in which case you must not fail to exert your influence, with the Muscat Government to preserve unanimity with that of Baghdad, to the end that the united exertions of all may be the more efficaciously exerted against the common enemy the French. I may here add, that we have a Squadron of His Majesty's Ships blocking up the straits of Babel-Mandel, and another on the Malabar Coast, so that under the Divine Blessing to our efforts, the French cannot send men on stores to their .Friend and the Sultan, and I am in great hopes, that even with him the pacific system the English wish to maintain in India will not be interrupted but we are preparing if necessary. Dated 80th November 1798, CCLXIX. From M r , M anesty , to President &amp; Governor, &amp;c., in Council at Bombay. Eon'ble Sir, The Pacha of Baghdad has since the date of my last address made certain political requests to me. Early in the month of July, a report k i, t ' ^•' ie ^ a PP 0 ^ n ^ men ^ Harford Jones Brydges (then in England) was made by the Court of Directors on 5th July 1798 —as ' Resident at the Court of Pacha of Bagdad.' This appointment was made in supersession ot a temporary arrangement made a short time previously by Mr. Manesty of sending Mr. Reinaud to Baghdad as agent on behalf of the Company and had in view amongst other objects of the facilitating the transmission of news to, and from, India, and of watching the proceedings of French emissaries who were occasionally proceed ing to, and from, India, through the Baghdad Pachali, with the view as was supposed of communicating intelligence to General Bonsparte, who it was believed had projected on invasion of India via Egypt and the Red bea. ^ It may be mentioned here that the Bombay Government had sanctioned on SOth November 1783 the i of &amp; N a ti ve Ag e nt at Baghdad on &amp; olUklfXQO p. a. for the purpose of transacting business with the Pacha on behalf ^of the Company. Coja Marcar who had performed the duties of an Agent for the Lompany from July 1781 with remuneration was granted arrears of pay at the above rate.353 prevailed here that Syud Sultan meditated an attack on Bussorah on account of certain ancient pecuniary claims of his deceased father, on the Pachalic of Baghdad, resisted by Soliman Pacha, and that in order to enable himself effectually to execute his hostile intentions, he was engaged in negotiating a peace with his formidable enemy, Seeggin Ebu Basched il Mutter, the Jooaseme Shaik, and towards the close of the month of July, this report was confirmed by the receipt here of letters from Mascat, communicating the designs of Syud Sultan in greater detail. On the 20th August the Pacha invited Mr. Reinaud at Baghdad to a confidential conversation in which His Excellency represented to that gentleman, that his servant, the Mussaleem of Bussorah, had communicated to him intelligence respecting certain designs entertained by Syud Sultan of Maskat, which considering the war in which he was engaged against the Wahabi Shaik and the recent inimical proceedings of the French against the Ottoman Empire in the invasion of Egypt he felt to be rather of a puzzling and unpleasant nature, and desired in the most forcible and pressing manner that he (Mr. Reinaud). would immediately communicate to me his (the Pacha's) request, that as a still further and finally convincing proof of my friendship for him, and of my personal regard for his welfare and Jiis interest, I would, without delay, write letters to Syud Sultan and to Shaik Suggur, strongly expressive of my hope that they would, on mature considera tion, give up the idea of operating hostilely against a friendly power peculiarly connected hy existing circumstances with the British JSmpire. Mr. Keinaud, in a qualified reply to the application of the Pacha, in which he carefully and prudently avoided committing either himself or the Residency, consented expeditiously to communicate to me His Excellency's important wishes. I received early in September Mr. Reinaud's private letter, and a letter from the Pacha on the subject, and the Pacha in his communication, which was a very friendly and satisfactory one, advised me of his having ordered the Mussaleem to co-operate with me towards the accomplishment of his desires On the receipt of these advices, I instantly communicated with the Mussaleem, and expressed to him my intention to despatch two of the factory Janissaries without delay to Mascat and Raailkhima, charged with letters from me to Syud Sultan, and Shaik Suggur couched in terms even exceeding the ardent wishes of the Pacha. The Mussaleem in reply informed me that the active inclination, which I manifested to promote the interests of the Pacha's Government, could not fail very highly to gratify His Excellency, but that as he had himself written to Syud Sultan and Shaik Suggur on the interesting subject, and early expected their replies to his letters, he ventured to suggest the eligibility of my postponing my intended proof of friendship towards this country, until it might be possible further to ascertain the real intentions of Syud Sultan regarding Bussorah, I willingly closed with the proposal of the Mussaleem. I despatched a chocadar belonging to Govern ment to Baghdad, charged with a proper letter for the Pacha, addressed to the care of Mx Reinaud, to whom I gave instructions respecting its delivery to His Excellency. Mr. Eeinaud presented the letter to the Pacha in person, and on giving it into his hands, he, in obedience to my orders, assured His Excellency that I should always have the highest pleasure in facilitating the accomplishment of his general wishes, and that on the particular occasion in question, I was ready to adopt any means for their attainment, consistent with good policy, and with the ancient amity fortunately subsisting between our respective nations. The Pacha, after having read my letter with pleasure and354 attention, most kindly observed in his reply to Mr. Reinaud's oommunication that ''Mr. Manesty has now completed his friendship towards me. He is my real, sincere, and faithful friend, and T will always consider his wishes as my own.' The Pacha then requested Mr. Eeinaud to receive another letter for me, which would be sent to him on the following day for speedy transmission and charged him to be most particular in his communications to me respecting the satisfaction which he (the Pacha) felt in my friendly conduct towards him. 'The Pacha's second letter, which was a peculiarly kind and pleasing one, contained a request that I would persevere in my friendly disposition towards him, and take such measures in conjunction with the Mussaleem to prevent the threatened attacks of Syad Sultan, as I might deem politic and expedient and tending to the preservation of his honor and the security of the country. Previous to the receipt of the Pacha's second letter, the Mussaleem received repli.es to his letters to Syud Sultan and Shaik Suggur. A negotiation com menced between the Mussaleem and Moolla Ibrahim Ali, the Commander of the Maskat Annual Coffee P leet then lying at Buchire, which I did not find it necessary to interfere. The dispute between the Pacha and Syud Sultan, of which I had long foreseen the issue, has been amicably settled, the Maskat fleet has repaired to Bussorah, and'actual friendly intercourse has taken place between the Turkish Government and subjects of the Imam. Thus Honourable Sir, without taking one single measure or exposing the nation or the Honourable Company to the sma llest political difficulty, I have in the Pacha's estimation rendered him a most esse ntial service, and given him the most unequivocal proof of my being authorized by you and personally inclined to promote his interests on all occasions.' I have, &amp;c., SAMUEL MANESTY. Bussora ; The 17th December 1798. CCLXX.

The May, however, has made such a quick passage to and from Bussora, that I have not at present the honor of transmitting you his reply, of which I am in hourly expectation. Yesterday hove in sight a two masted vessel from Bombay upon which I immediately dispatched a boat on board of her, to ascertain whe ther the Captain intended coming on shore. She kept on her course, however, to Bussora without even lying to for the boat, which had nearly reached her so that I conjecture, she could not have been the bearer of any of your letters to the Nuwab's address or she would no doubt have cast anchor at Bushire. The Shah's ^ rom Iran we have received intelligence, that His Majesty has proceeded tionin perS01110 K:horassan) at ihe head of an expedition, which has nothing less Shat - for its objects than the subjugation of Zeman Shah's dominions. Of his attaining this there can be little doubt and the whole country is already in commotion at his approach. The seat of the Eoyal presence at this moment is Mushhed, the holy city, between which City and Shiraz the Nuwab hag j355 constantly the honor of corresponding with his Majesty, and expects imme diately to be favoured with an audience. From every thing which has yet appeared the highest hopes are entertained of the success of his mission. He has been received by Mohammud Ali Khan, the Beiglerbeg, in a still unex ampled and unexpected. The nobles and Chiefs of the City came out three Kos to welcome him, and the Beiglerbeg himself received him without the walls and conducted him in with every circumstance of respect. May this farther instance of the influence of your happy auspicious be only the omen of successes yet to come, and may it be participated until the end of time to the interests, over which you preside. ^As to the arrival of the Imam of Muscat and his expedition against The imam of Behrain, the Beiglerbeg had sent his brother in command of a body of t ^ 0 a n s ^ n ®t Pedi ' troops to Bushire, are now come to a halt without the City. Shaik Nasser Retake.' Khan, however, has taken upon himself the office of mediator, and proceeded to Behrain, where he has received from the inhabitants an acquiescence in the payment of the Dewany Revenue, which supersedes the necessity of the expe dition altogether. Syed Sultan, it would appear, is a little enraged to find himself thus left in the lurch, and to make amends for his disappointment, has taken possession of the Castle of Kharuk, from which he has since pro ceeded to Behrain. Shaik Nasser has not returned, but writes that the Uttoobees are willing to accede to every proposition of the Beiglerbeg,- whose brother is now writing for farther intelligence from Behrain, to decide upon what line of conduct, the events of the hour may make it necessary to pursue. I have little farther to add but my professions of sincere attachment to those whom I serve aiad my assurances that whatever occurrences may be worthy of transmission, I shall have the honour of forwarding to you with all possible dispatch. Bushire, 22nd July 1799. P. »S.—I have ordered a boat to Bussora to return with your commands if there be any, to the address of the Nuwab my master. CCLXXX From S amuel M anesty to the Governor and Council at Bombay. Eon'ble Sir, In my former address, I have had the honour to expatiate on the subject of the Bacha's suspicions of Seiad Sultan, and in a particular one, I ventured ♦ The Imaum in 1799, proceeded, in compliance with the application of the Beiglerbeg of Fars, with four ships, and sixty Buggalows and armed gallivats, to attack the Uttoobees, and{reduce Bahrein. The Ottoobees had only three ships, which were on a trading voyage in the Indian seas, which were all taken by the Imaum on their return. The Uttoobees wrote on this occasion to Shaikh Nassir of Bushire, stating that the island of Bahrein was originally under the Turkish Government, the Kings of the Sofi race having for some time brought it under ontrol, but that it was seventy years since they had been in possession of it ; that they were now desirous of becoming subject to the King of Persia, to whom they would pay tribute. Shaikh Nassir availed himself of this invitation, and privately proceeded to Bahrein, and received the tribute for 1798. The Imaum, on hearing of the intelligence, expressed his displeasure at the Shaikh's conduct. He seized the opportunity of Shaikh Nassiv's absence from Busbire to spread a report in Karrack thbt he had fled from the Island and Shaikh Gbanum, Shaikh Nassir's cousin, had been appointed Governor, recommending them to send all the Bushire people back from Karrack, as Shaikh Gbanum would consider them as rebels and confine their women, and to entrust the charge of the fort to him. The Karrackees, in consequence, gave up the fort to the Imaum, who immediately vrote to the Beglerbeg of Fars, that as there weie very few people at Karrack, he had taken possession of it, to prevent the Uttoobees occupying It, and offered to give five years' revenue in advance if the Island were given up to him. The result of this application is not known, but Syud Sultan havino- amicably adjusted matters with the Uttoobees and the Shaikh of Bushire, returned to Muskat, an event ■which restored tranquillity to the Gulf.356 Designs of Imam of Maskat against Basrah. Partiality of the Imam to the French. Tippn Sultan's Ambassadors to Kabul. Tippu's Ambassa dors to Constan tinople. respectfully to express to you His Excellency's ardent desire, that the British Government in India should explain to Seiad Sultan the increased degree o amity now happily subsisting between the British and Ottoman Courts, and signify to him the consequent necessity of his conducting himself in a friendly manner towards the Government of Bagdad and Bussora.^ The apprehensions of the Bacha, that the intentions towards him of Seiad Sultan might be inimical were certainly stronger during the late visit of that restless and ambi tious Prince to the Head of the Persian Gulph, than towards the close of the last year. I have made known to you the honorable cnofidence placed m me by the Bacha on the occasion, and I now, at the earnest desire of His Excel, ency, take the liberty to solicit, that you will cause to be made to Seiad Sultan some intimation favourable to the Bacha, and likely in its nature to give additional security to the country under his jurisdiction. Altho' I dare not presume to form any decided opinion on the eligibility of intimation favorable to the Bacha being made by the British Government in India to Seiad Sultan, I think it a Duty to my Hon'ble Emplovers respectfully to suggest to your superior judgment that one similar to that mentioned in the preceding paragraph would afford very high gratification to a Vizir of the Ottoman Empire, whose conduct now uniformly manifests particular attach- ment to our country and its best interests in this quarter of the World. I have frequently, according to my judgment, had official reason to express sentiments, and to communicate information tending to prove the partialitv of Seiad Sultan to the Erench, and proportionably to lessen our con fidence in his assurances of friendship for the British Nation. Justice towards him now, however, urges me to state, that I have apparently substantial cause of belief,' that the Beport lately circulated at Bushire of Tippoo Sultan being still in existence and attributed to him, originated in the policy of certain of the servants of this deceased Prince, sent on Embassies by him about the month of Eebruary last, to the Persian Court, and to the Sublime Porte. I am given to understand that the people in question accompanied by others destined to negotiate on the part of Tippu Sultan with Zemaun Shah arrived in a vessel belonging to their Master at Muscat, in the month of April# The Embassadors to the Court of Kabul, proceeded wi^h their Suite from Muscat in a Dow or Dingy to Someana. The Embassador to the Court of Tehran, with his Suite, was conveyed from Muscat to Bushire in a vessel belonging to Seiad Sultan and on the same vessel arrived here on the 12th ultimo, with his Suite, the Embassador to the Court of. Constantinople. The Embassador to the Court of Constantinople maintains positively that hia late Sovereign is still alive, and expresses an ardent desire to prosecute his journey. He is, however, at present detained here by the Mussaleem in consequence of my having suggested to him, that as all the late Subjects of Tippu Sultan are now the Subjects of the British Crown, he ought not to permit the Embassador to advance without the express permission of the Bacha^ Indeed I entertained an intention on the first arrival of this people at Bussora, to demand them as British Subjects and to send them to the Presidency. As, however, their mission was originally undertaken by the authority of a Man exercising Sovereign power, and as they are charged with certain Presents jntended by the late Tippu Sultan for the use and Gratification of the Grand Signor and the Bacha and as the prosecution of their journey cannot under present circumstances, operate injuriously, I have on maturer reflection pre ferred the adoption of a more moderate conduct, and confined my measures357 respecting them to the before mentioned suggestion to the Mussaleem, and my present Eepresentation to you. I have the honor to transmit Copy of a Letter to Harford Jones, Esq., dated the 29th Ultimo, from which you will observe the departure for Bagdat of Mr. Eaymond and the Gunners Draper and Kirby the former having under his Charge, for delivery to Mr. Jones, the Military Stores per Panther intended for the use of the Bacha. I have also the honor to transmit Copy of a letter from Eear-Admiral Blankett, dated the 5th August, and received here on the 2nd Instant. I have also the honor to transmit at the request of His Excellency John Spencer Smith, conveyed to me in a private Letter which I received on the 7th Instant, an extract from a private Letter from the Eight Hon'ble Lord Minto to that Minister, dated Vienna, the 16th August and several miscellaneous papers. I have also the honor to transmit a packet for the Hon'ble the President on service ' received on the 9th instant, from Harford Jones, Esq., with his Letter to me of the 28th Ultimo, by a Government Chowdar. 1 have also the honor to transmit you the Lloyds Evenings Post, from the 12th to the 29th July, and Journal de Erancfort from the 22nd July to the 9th August, containing very interesting Intelligence, to which I beg leave to make a respectful reference.

To The R ight H gn'ble the E arl op MORNINGTON, Governor-General, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;e., in Council at Fort W illiam. -{In the Political Department.) Mt Lord, I have the honor to acknowledge the Eeoeipt on the 15 i Ultimo per Tippo'. Amw Antilope via Bombay, of Tour Lordship's Commands of the SiAusust, enolo-^ ? l0!,pe&lt;1 t i.i • i'i* i j 11 , , „ *' &amp; • ' sent back to Indis. smg a Letter in duplicate to the address of Hussum Alii; and I consequently most sincerely rejoice that I had previously paid requisite attention to the circumstance of the arrival here, on their way to Constantinople of Embasadors from the late Tippu Sultan to the Ottoman Emperor. Erom the accompanying Copies of the 4^, 5A &amp; 6^ paragraphs of my address to the Hon'ble the President in Council, in the Political Department, of the 10^ Instant, Your Lordship will please to observe the detention here of the Embassadors in question by Abdulla Aga, the Mussaleem of Bussora, at my suggestion. On the 15 Ultimo the Embassadors (by name Seiad Ali Mahomed Kandree &amp; Seiad Madar-il-Deen), their Secretary Hussun Ali, and their attendants, were residing here by the permission of the Mussaleem in the late Erench Factory, in eager expectation of the Eeceipt by the Mussaleem from Bagdad of orders from the Bacha respecting them, and actively exerting themselves to persuade358 the Turkish Offioers, and the general Inhabitants of the place, of the existence of Tippoo Sultan, and of the extent and solidity of his Dominions and power in India. Such is the friendly disposition towards me of Abdulla Aga, the Mussaleem, that on the Receipt of Your Lordship's Commands I immediately determined confidentially to communicate with him on the subject of them, and I fortunately found him most cordially inclined to co-operate with me to the extent of his ability and power, for the accomplishment of Your Lord ship's wishes for the Return of the Embassy. At the suggestion and recommendation of the Mussaleem I sent to him by Akan Mahomed Nebee (a Bussora Merchant of great respectability, attached to the Factory) one of the Letters for Hussun Alii, which the Mussaleem meant to deliver into his own Hands at the Government House. On the Mussaleem sending one of his Officers, however to the late Prench Factory with a Message to Hussun Alii requesting his personal presence at the Grovernment House, he (Hussun Alii) was found to be confined by serious illness, and unable to rise from his Bed. The principal Embassador, Seiad Ali Mahomed Kandree, however, immediately determined to visit the Mussaleem. During the Visit in question, the Mussaleem took a proper opportunity of delivering to Seiad Ali Mahomed Kandree the Letter for Hussun Alii, who, on reading it, coolly observed, that if the contents were really true, if Tippoo Sultan had positively been killed in Battle, and Seringapatam taken by the English, still the Children of his master might be alive, and that one of them might have succeeded to his Throne and power, and been enabled by ability and good fortune to resist or overthrow the armies of the English, that he was an Embassador from a Sovereign Power to a Sovereign Power, not merely from Tippoo Sultan to Sultan Selim, that he was a servant, that he would be faithful to his trust, that he would present, with the permission of God, to the Ottoman Emperor at Constantinople, the Letters and Presents with which he was charged, and that Religion called on him to represent to the Sublime Porte, the miseries and misfortunes of the Mahomedans in India, Seiad Ali Mahomed Kandree added on taking leave of the Mussaleem, that he considered himself, companions, and people under the immediate protection of the Turkish Government, and in a moving and pathetic strain of Eloquence forcibily|urged the Mussaleem carefully to avoid attachment to Christians, and to patronize and protect on all occasions to the utmost of his abilities, the followers of their Holy Prophet Mahomed. The artful conduct of Seiad Ali Mahomed Kandree made some impres sion on the Mussaleem, and the conference which had taken place between them having been a public one, he found himself forced to adopt a peaculiarly cautious conduct. He informed me, by means of my confidential Messenger to him, that he was unpleasantly situated, that I might however depend on his co-operation with me, as far as prudence and his situation would admit, in the attainment of my wishes respecting the Embassadors; that my friendship for him would suggest to me the positive necessity of his so regulating his pro. ceedings, as to avoid committing himself with his immediate Superior the Bacha ; and that he strongly recommended to me to cease all active measures respecting the Embassadors, until the arrival of the expected Orders from Bagdat. From the moment in which I had the honor to receive Your Lordship's commands, I determined, at all events, to prevent the prosecution, by the359 Embassadors, of their journey towards Constantinople, convinced, altho'Your commands in question are not forcible on the subject, by my own knowledge of the infamous Contents of the Letters under their charge from Tippoo Sultan, and by Your Lordship's acquaintance with the Mahomedan Character, that Tour Lordship could not possibly disapprove a policy, which had for its object the judicious prevention of the circulation thro' the Turkish Dominions, of scandalous falsities, calculated to establish opinions extremely unfavorable to the British Name, and likely locally to diminish in an injurious and essential degree its present general Credit and Honor. I however yielded with apparent cordiality to the suggestion s of the Mussaleem, and assured him that I was only induced to do so by unlimited confidence in his friendshipj and by a conviction of my right to claim the Embassadors, and their attendants, as Subjects of the British Crown, whatever might be the nature of the orders respecting them expected from Bagdat. On the 23rd Ultimo the Orders from Bagdat respecting the Embassadors were received, and they directed the Mussaleem to furnish them with requisite means of immediately prosecuting their Journey to Bagdat. The Mussaleem immediately communicated the tenor of those Orders to me, with an assurance, that altho' he must apparently yield obedience to them, he was ready to join me in any plan that my prudence and good judgment might suggest to me, to induce the Embassadors to relinquish their journey. With the Mussaleem's concurrence and knowledge I immediately sent to the Embassadors Akan Mahomad, Nebee, accompanied by the Eaptory Linguist and a Eactory Janissary instructed to point out to them, and to Hussun Alii, the real situation of the Dominions of their late Master, their consequent position 1 as British Subjects the eligibility of their acknowledging Your Lordship's authority, and the necessity of their yielding obedience to it, to explain to them the probable consequences to themselves of an obstinate resistance of your wishes, and the probable state of misery to which, in a foreign Country, they might be exposed subsequent to their arrival at Constantinople where the Ottoman Emperor could not possibly, on account of his Political Situation and Connection with great Britain, shew them any favor or countenance; to inform them that it was my positive determination not to allow them to leave Bussora, and to send them to Bombay on the Antilope ; altho' I rather wished such an arrangement to result from their own inclination than com pulsion ; and to assure them, that in the event of their consenting to my wishes with cheerfulness, they might depend on Your Lordship^s liberality towards them, and on my recommending them to your favor and patronage. The communications made in my name by Akan Mahomed Nebee to the Embassadors, and to Hussun Alii, operated the desired effect. They expressed a confidence in the Intelligence received of the Death of Tippoo Sultan, the Capture of Seringapatam, the division of the Conquered Country, the Establish ment at Vellore of the Sons and Eamily of the late Sultan, and Your Lordship's liberality towards his Subjects. They acknowledged themselves to be subject! of the British Crown. They consented to relinquish their intention to prosecute a Journey to Constantinople, and to proceed to Bombay on the Antilope. On the 25th Ultimo the Embassadors signified to the Mussaleem the change which had taken place in their sentiments. On the 26th Ultimo the Embassadors visited the Mussaleem, and publicly acknowledged, in the Hall of Audience at the Government House, theirsubjection to British Power and their desire to obey the wishes respecting them of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General, on which occasion the Mussaleem expressed his inclination to afford them every honorable and requisite assistance in the accomplishment of a Journey to Bagdad, if they wished to undertake it, and that as long as they claimed his protection he should, considering them as Gufests in his House, feel it his Duty to afford it to them, but that if they felt and understood themselves to be British Subjects, and if they wished to acknowledge British authority, and to submit to the orders and commands of the British Government in India, he could not withhold his consent to their immediate Return to that Gnuntry, in conformity to the wishes of the British Resident. On the 27th Ultimo the Mussaleem assembled a Divan for the purpose of submitting to the consideration of the Members of it the determination of the Embassadors of the late Tippoo Sultan to return to India, and his consequent official situation as the Representative at Bussora of the Bacha of Bagdat, on which occasion thfey gave it as their unanimous opinion that he (the Mussaleem) was not authorized to permit the Embassadors to deviate from the commands of their late Sovereign. The Mussaleem however resisted this opinion, and declared his determination, originating in mature reflection on the increasing amity by which the Ottoman and British Empires are now fortunately united, to yield to my reasonable official Representations to him, of the necessity of his delivering up to me the immediate subjects of my Sovereign, particularly as it was their own wish to submit to my authority. On the evening of the 28th Ultimo the members of the Divan went publicly to the late Erench Eactory, and required from the Embassadors a declaration of their final Determination respecting their Journey to Constantinople, or their return of India. On the morning of the 29th Ultimo the Mussaleem adopted a similar measure. On both these occasions the Embassadors declared, that as by the permis sion of God their late Sovereign Master, Tippoo Sultan, had ceased to live and as his Dominions had been placed by Eortune under the Jurisdiction of the British Nation, they considered their Mission as annulled, and deemed it now to be their Duty, as British Subjects to return to India, in conformity to the wishes and Commands of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General, communicated to them by the British Resident. On the Evening of the 29th Ultimo further Debates took place at the Government House between the Mussaleem and the Members of the Turkish Divan, respecting the Embassdors, and the Letters and Presents with which they were charged for the Ottoman Emperor ; subsequent to which the Mussaleem informed me, through Akan Mahomed Nebee, that I might consider myself at liberty to cause the conveyance to India, of the Embassadors from the late Tipoo Sultan, whenever I pleased, under the stipulation that the Presents and Letters which the deceased Prince had, during the existence of his Sovereign Power, destined to the perusal and use of the Ottoman Emperor should previous to their Departure, be delivered to him for transmission to Bagdat, to be by the Bacha held at the Imperial disposal, This information from the Mussaleem did not surprize me. I had foreseen the probability of his being either inclined by a sense of Duty, or of his being forced by the conduct and measures of the inferior Officers of hisV £2.0; 361 ^ Government, to desire to obtain the Presents and Letters in question for transmission to Ba^dat; and I had purposely foreborne to mention them in my previous communications to him respecting the Embassadors. On this occasion however T instructed Akan Mahomed Nebee to represent to the Mussaleem in my name, and in qualified language, the propriety of his consentiog to the Return to India of the Embassadors, with the Letters and Presents, and to state to him that suoh an arrangement would be a striking testimony of the sincirety of the Friendship subsisting between the Courts ol London and Constantinoplej that Letters from a deceased Monarch, the invete rate Enemy of the British Nation, could ueither prove interesting nor acceptable to the Ottoman Emperor, and tbat the Presents were unworthy of Imperial attention. The Mussaleem in reply to the Message observed in a very cordial and hand some manner, that in his estimation the purport of it was correct and reason able, but ^hat my friendship for him would not permit me to forget that he was a servant ; and that he might by a compliance with my wishes respecting the Letters and Presents, personally expose himself to serious danger. The Mussaleem added, that the Ottoman Emperor might, on becoming acquainted with the circumstances, possibly wish that he (the Mussaleem) had yeilded in this instance to my representation, but that, ignorant of the sentiments of his Sovereign it was impossible for him to do so, or to neglect to obtain the Letters and Presents, and to transmit them to his immediately Superior, the Bacha of Bagdat. Einding that futher attempts to influence the Musealeem to abandon his determination respecting the Letters and Pesents must prove fruitless, I gave up the point at Bussora, and determined to address a Letter on the subject to His Majesty's Minster at the Sublime Porte, of which I have the honor to transmit a copy for the information of Your Lordship. The Mussaleem reported, on the 30 Ultimo, by an Express Ohowdar to the Bactra. B ussrah ; 27th November 1799. I have, etc., SAMUEL MANESTY. CCLXXIII.

Be this as it may, it is now incumbent on me to advise you, that by a , letter I have received from the Bight Hon'ble Earl of Mornington the Malcolm^rdwrd Governor-General under date the 5^ August or 3^ of Rabbee ul awal, and Pe^ ssion ^ previous of course to the Receipt of the Intelligence above stated from your Agents at Bushire or from Mullia ittejaur to Aka Mohammed, I have been advised that the annual Menace of Zemaun Shaws Invasion having been again renewed his Lordship has thought it necessary to take immediate Measures with view to impose an effectual check upon the designs of that Prince, in view to which and to the importance and efficacy of the measures in contem plation to be adopted the Governor-General has thought fit to nominate Captain John Malcolm an English Officer as Envoy at the Court of Persia 2578 F.D362 under whom it is his Lordship, and also mine that you should continue to act in promoting the object of this Embassy, to the success of which his Lordship is no less than I am well satisfied, th,at your Knowledge, ^eal and address can and well materially contribute, the Eight Hon'ble the Governor-General being at the same time perfectly well disposed and inclined to make you a suitable Reward, as well for the services you have already seperately rendered, as for those you may further as usefully contribute in affording in all respects your best assistance to Captain Malcolm from the date of that gentleman's Entrance into until his return from Persia and in the event of whioh I have no doubt of your rendering satisfaction in all these points during that officer's mission I may venture to assure you that you will thereby essentially promote your own and your family's welfare, and give great satisfaction to Lord Mornington and no less to me. 5. I shall in this confidence only now add that I expect Captain Malcolm here time enough from Madras, whence he is coming by the way of Hyderabad and Poona to be able to take his Passage for the Gulph of Persia, in the next month's Cruizer and on his landing at Bushire you will take care, that He he received with every Honor as the Envoy of the Governpr-General of Irdia, and consideringyourself thereafter as entirely subject to that gentleman's orders jn whatever concerns of the Embassy you are to act therein after fully advising him of what you have yourself done as he shall recommend and direct and either accompany him to the King's Court or be otherwise employed, as he shall from time to time see meet in the high Political mission, with which this gentelman is instructed nor can anything prove more agreeable to me, than to hear that in all respects you have afforded him satisfaction and contributed as much as possible to the honor and success of the Embassy in its present form until his arrival you will be careful to keep the state of the negotiations in a favorable progress without however concluding anything but advising Baba Kh^n, that for his last purposs the Bight Hon'ble the Governor-General is aboi t to send an English gentleman, with whom you will continue to act as above directed. Bombay 16Q. September 1799. CCLXXIV. From— L ord M ornington, To—The Governor in Council, Bombay. We have the honour to inform you that the Eight Hon'ble the Governor- General in Council has appointed Captain Malcolm to be Envoy from the Governor-General in India, to the Court of Baba Khan the present King of Persia. Captain Malcolm who has been directed to proceed with all convenient expedition to Bombay, and we desire that you will furnish him with one of the Hon'ble Company's Cruizers, for the purpose of conveying him and his Suite to Bussora. The Governor in Council also will furnish Captain Malcolm with copies of all the correspondence which has passed with Mehdis Alii Khan, the Company's Ag'ent at Bushire, who has been employed under the instructions of the Governor-General in a temporary deputation to the Court of Persia.363 Captain Malcolm bas been desired to visit Busbire and we conceive it probable tbat before he can r each that place Mebdi Alii Khan will have returned from bis temporary Mission to the Court of Persia. We desire that Mehdi Alii .Khan may be directed to place himself under the orders of Captain Malcolm, who will accordingly direct his future motions, duties and station. Captain Malcolm has been directed, should the season admit to touch at Moskat, and we desire tbat the Governor in Council will furnish Captaiu Malcolm with copies of such parts of the correspondence of Mehdi Ali Khan ns may relate to his negotiations at Moskat, in 1798 together with every informn- tion relative to the grounds, on which the fidelity of the Imam to his engage ment has been suspected. Captain Malcolm has been directed to endeavour to adjust while at Moskat any points relating to our interests at that place, which the Governor in Council at Bombay may recommend particularly to his attention, but Captain Malcolm has been instructed, not to permit any object of that nature, to delay his voyage to Persia. Should Captain Malcolm on his arrival in Persia find the Court of Persia favourably inclined towards the British interests, he has been directed to endeavour to establish a commercial intercourse regulated on liberal and enlightened principles between the Persian dominions and the British possessions in India. As the information necessary to enable Captain Malcolm to state the advantages of a commercial connection in the most favourable manner, can be best obtained from the Governor in Council at Bombay, we desire that you will furnish him with such instructions and materials for this purpose as you may judge proper. We further desire that you will form a plan of such commercial arrange ments with the Court of Persia as may appear to you desirable and that you will transmit the same to the Governor-General in Council for his approbation as soon as possible. Captain Malcolm being directed not to conclude any commercial treaty until he shall receive further orders from this Government. We desire that you will transmit to Captain Malcolm by every opportunity whatever information you may receive respecting the designs and motions of Zimanshah. The Governor-General, the Residents at Poonah with Dowlut Boa Sindiah will correspond punctually with your President on this subject. You will be pleased to order Captain Malcolm to be furnished with a copy of the Cypher No. 11. CCLXXV. From—The Governor of Bombay and Council, To—C aptain J ohn M alcolm , Envoy of the Supreme Government to the Court of Persia. 1. Having been advised by the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in instructions to Council of your appointment to the oflBce of Envoy from the Supreme Gov- ^M^skat ernment to Baba Ali Khan the present ruler of Persia and His Lordship in Council having on the same occasion been pleased to direct tbat you should be furnished at this Presidency with copies of all the correspondence which has passed with Mirza Mahedi Ali Khan, the Company's Resident at Bushire, who has been employed under the instructions of the Governor-General in a temporary deputation to the Court of Persia, we have in consequence the pleasure to send to364 your herewith in the youoher No. 1 transcripts of the papers comprising the aforesaid correspondence, inclusive of an extract of our latest advices from Sind, under date the 29th of October as forwarded by Mr. Nathan Crow, the Hon'ble Company's Eesident there, and also copies of two letters with accompaniments from the Resident at Bagdad, under date the 16th and 28th of September followed by our Resident's answer thereto. 2. Mehedi Ali Khan has, as you will observe, from our President's letter to him under date the 16th of September, been advised of your present mission and directed in pursuance of Lord Mornington's desire to place himself under your orders from the date of your arrival in Persia. 3. With respect to the affairs of Muscat we have also been advised by the Supreme Government of your instructions to' touch at that port, with a view to adjust such points relating to the Company's interests as may appear to us to require your attention, without however permitting any object of that nature to delay your voyage to Persia. 4. In pursuance of this intention, we beg leave to refer you for the particulars of Mehedi Ali Khan's negociation at Muscat in 1798 to tbe series of papers copied into the first part of the Voucher No. 1 whereby you will observe that on the 12th October of that year a Cowlnamah or Convention was concluded with Syed Sutaun the Imaum but as, since that time suspicion have been entertained of that prince's fidelity to the engagement thus entered into we take this opportunity to furnish you with such information we possess relative to the grounds thereof as contained in the Vouchers No. 2 &amp; 3 which may be classed under four distinct heads. Ut. —Employment of Frenchmen in his service and alleged partiality for that nation. Unfriendly conduct of the Governor of Zanguebar ah island dependent on the Government of the Imaura on the coast of Africa to His Majesty's squadron under the command Commodore (now admiral) Blankett, on the occasion of their touching there for supplies in the course of their voyage to the Eed Sea from England. 3rd. —For having facilitated the transmission of presents from the late Tippoo Suktaun to Baba Khan the King of Persia. 4t}ily and lastly. —Freighting the a ship for Mauritius with large quantitys of grain and brimestone having for Commander a Frenchman from the Pearl a captured country ship at the particular request of the Imaum, and giving information to and treating the enemy with attention besides receiving on the 10th of November a French Agent from the Mauritius said to have been deputed on particular business with the Government of Muscat. 5. Having thus enumerated the grounds on which the Imaum's fidelity to his engagements may be questioned to occurs to remark thereon as far more especially as regards the three first points—that the explanations afforded by that Prince, as per Translation of his answer in the voucher No. 2 may be admitted to be at least specious enough ; though in respect to the fourth the tTrftrrmation received from Mr. Cramlington—one of the officers of the captured ship Pearl —who arrived here a few days ago and has since died—there appears if the report be accurate (a point which the premature faith of the officer in question did not afford time to ascertain) a substantial ground to impute the365 Imaum a violation of the letter and spirit of the Cowlnamat concluded with Mehedi Ali Khan in October 1798 as already referred to. 6. In respect more especially to this last and generally also with regard to fyie other points objected against the Imaum it will rest with you to enter into such investigation and make such adjustment with that Princes i 11 promotion of the Hon'ble Company's interestj as may tend to induce, on his part the greatest attention to his engagements. 7. Having had repeated applications from the Eesident at Bussora to adopt some means of impressing on the mind of the Imaum of Muskat the conduct he should maintain towards the Government of Bagdad in consequence of increased degree of amity between the British and Ottoman Courts; we advised that gentleman in reply that we should avail ourselves of your intended visit to that port to request of you to interest yourself to the purport suggested in the voucher No. 4 comprising extract of various letters from Mr. Manesty, explanatory of the object which the Basha of Bagdad would thus seem to be desirous of affecting and we now accordingly recommend the subject to your attention. 8. The Hon'ble Company's Cruizer the Intrepid, will be ready to receive you and the gentleman with you, in foua: days from the present date. We are, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, JONATHAN DUNCAN, Etc. Council, B ombay C astle ; 2nd December 1799. CCLXXVI. Translation of a letter from Syed Seyf Bin Mahomed Regent of MusJkat, to the Hon'hle the Governor, without date, received the 2^ of Dec. 1799. On the 22i of Rebyul Sanee or the 231 of September, a representation E^pi aining was made of the particulars of a French vessel under English Colours, having in the Evening, appeared off the Bar of this place, and having gone towards Bushire and Bussora. We did not know what ship This was, or whether she was going, some days after, intelligence was received at Muskat, of its being a French Vessel, I was then under apprehension for the Hon'ble Companys Vessels and the Man of War, who could not be informed of the Circumstance; on the 28^ of Rebyul Sanee or the 29^ September a Man of War arrived here from Bushire, I had a meeting with the Captain of the Man of War. and acquainted him, with the particulars of such a ship having passed at some distance from the Port, and gone towards Bussora, the Captain employed a few days in making preparations and taking on Board such necessaries as he required, as well as wood and water, I inquired of the Captain of the Man of War, whether it was his intention to follow the tract of the Vessels, which I had mentioned to him as he had best few Sailors and Sepoys; and told him as there was no difference between the English and this Sircar but that they were as onf», to take some of my Sepoys ; however much I endeavoured to convince him of the propriety of this, yet he would not Consent or agree366 to it, after which he left this; It was God's decree, that he did not listen to my Words and this business happened. The Man of War had not more than Sixty or Seventy Sailors and Soldiers on Board ; the particulars of all this business on the 14$ of Jumaadulowal or the 14t h of October I wrote in a letter to you, which I hope you have received and perused, the friendship between these two States has been established from the period of Mr. Boddams and Mr. (name not legible) Government and there was not the smallest difference between our Countries and property, neither will there be, but our friendship will be increasing, the Port of Muskat is as Bombay, and Bombay as Muskat, in no manner or mode is there the smallest difference. The above I have before and now again repeat and I am in hopes that you are of the same way of thinking ; I am not on terms of friendship, with the French neither will I be : from the beginning to the present period, unanimity and the same good understanding has been established between the English and this State. Let it be known to you, Hon'ble Sir, the day on which it happened that the French ship met Mr. Manesty's and took her, and the two ships being burnt, and of the Erench bringing Mr. Manesty's ship to Muskat and anchoring her there, I know nothing of it, being then asleep in my house, in so much that had I had a knowledge of it, I never would have permitted her to have contend the cove, and anchored near the Batteries : when I was informed of her having anchored, near the two Batteries I thought of Detaining her a few days at that place, and of taking the Malim and horses from on board of her, :md spoke to the Company's Dellol about purchasing them, the Dellol, agree able to my orders purchased the horses, brought them and the Maulim on shore, and provided a house for him. The ship was for some days detained in the hopes, that in the interim one of your ships might arrive at the Entrance of the bar and take her, altho' I was in expectation of the Arrival of one of your ships yet did not one arrive; some wood and Water was supplied to that ship by the Sircar, in view to and for the purpose of deceiving to detain her, that an armed ship of yours might arrive, but none did : at length she sailed. His Highness Syed Sultaun proposed to send his ship the Futta Islam to the Mauritius, in view to demanding the ship (the name not legible). The property of his subject Khulphnn, which was seized by the Erench in the China Seas, and to bring that ship, and acquaint them with his having from the Port of Sowahil (a Port in the African shore) to this port done away all friendship and to insist on the above: Two Maulims have been taken from the Erench as officers, as our people were not acquainted with the navigation of those seas, I now perceive it to be advisable not to send that ship, but to make the Demand at any other time and have given those two Maulims their discharge that they may in two or three days, in any manner they think proper, get away: We will not hereafter keep a person belonging to the Erench Sircar in our employ. Do you Consider me as the Well wisher of your Sircar I am now the vice-regent of this place whatever matters of busi ness you, have do you, Sir, write me of &amp; without diveation therefrom, it shall be done: in this respect, let your mind be at ease. My hopes are to send my ships towards Bengal, Do you, Sir, considering Those ships as your own, oblige me with two lines of recommendation to the Guvernor General, that he considering them in the same light, may cause367 attention and civility to be shewn to my Vessels and Nokhadas : all the ships the property of this Sircar are yours, for the purpose of giving you information have I written this as between the two States and me, there is no difference, neither will there be, and do you Sir consider it in the same manner. , Hereafter whatever news on intelligence I hear I will write you of it. I am very anxious to come and pay my respects to you, but His Highness Syed Sultaun is not willing that I should travel. I am here the Well wisher of your Sircar: do you look on me as belonging to your Sircar— do not, you ever believe the Words of the Malignant but on investigating the matter let me be appretiated. A disturbance has lately evinced itself between the people of Kharak, and those parts : it is Syed Sultaun's intentions to send a force on the Futta Islam and other ships towards that place, for your information this is written. CCLXXVII. Traw-latton of a letter from KlSHENDAS Basftedoo, Broker at Muskat, to the Hon'hle the Governor of Botnhay, dated 16 Nov. 1799, received 2 Bee. 1799. I have already had the honor several times of laying before you the The imam disposed s tate of affairs in this quarter, &amp; shall be happy to find, that all my Com-wiiUfThe^gilsh, munications have reached you safe: particularly my last containing some very particular Intelligence which I sent to the Botella of Sheikh Jomaeh Bin Sultan Soory, the same which carried a Cargo of Horses to Mr. Smith. Let me beg as the greatest Instance of your favor &amp; Indulgence to your faithful &amp; humble Servant that you will occasionally honor him with a Reply. The news of the day (since I wrote your Honor as I did instantly, about the Capture of the Resident at Bussorai Ship &amp; her arrival at Muskat in the hands of the Prench) is as follows. Syed Sultan had at one time an intention, of sending a vessel to the Mauritius to recover a ship of Khulfan Bin Salim who is a subject of the Imams ; &amp; for this purpose had taken two ship officers from the French who understood the Navigation of that quarter. Reflecting* however, that the English might hear of this, he has altered his intention; &amp; dismissed the two Frenchmen to go where they please; The enclosed letter from' Syed Sief Mohammed will explain to you this circumstance more fully. Syed Sultan, I beg leave to assure your honor, is most sincerely &amp; anxiously disposed to cultivate the good Will of the English Gov-. He is constantly heard to say, that he considers the Interests of the Company, both now, &amp; ever after as altogether inseparable from his own, with many other expressions of the same sincere, and amicable Import. He begs me, in the present instance, to offer you his Kindest Regards; &amp; to assure you that he is the most devoted friend &amp; Servant of the Hon'bie Company. He is much in want of a domestic Physician, the most able &amp; experienced in his Profession, &amp; has desired me to communicate his earnest request, that you would order a Person of this Description to attend him. I The imam's appli- have obeyed his Highness's orders in conveying to you this desire of his; it368 remains with you, Hon'ble Sir, to judge how far it is deserving of attention. Whatever you may be pleased to order respecting the Accommodation of this Gentleman shall be done. I hope yon will ever consider me as the zealous &amp; faithful Servant of the Sirkar; one who can never yet accuse himself, &amp; jhopes he never will, of any Inattention to their Interests &amp; Concerns ; &amp; that, as such, you will constantly honor him with the Communication of your supreme Command. That my letter may not go empty handed, I beg leave to offer you, as a tribute of my unfeigned respect, 2 Baskets, containing 100 Pomegranates without seed, which, worthless as they are to lay before your honor, I trust to your Condescension &amp; favor to accept. They go in Charge of the Nakhoda of the Mansoory, who will have the honor of being introduced to you, &amp; will be conveyed to you by Aga Mohammed. GCLXXVIII.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2^ d Instant, with its Enclosures. I have perused, with attention, the whole of Mehedi Aly Khan's Correspond- The line of conduct ence, &amp; am happy to find from it, that there is reason to conclude the progress tltaSn Regard he has made, &amp; the Connections he has formed, will greatly facilitate the to Ma8kat - attainment of the chief objects of my Mission to the Persian Court. With respect to the Imaum of Muscat, tho' it may be difficult to prove that that Prince, has wilfully, &amp; direc tly violated any of the Articles of the Coulnamah entered into with Mehedy Aly Khan in October 1798. It appears very evident, that his Conduct has, in more Instances than one, been liable to strong Suspicion &amp; under that Idea, I should certainly judge the best Security Government could have for his faithful Adherence to his Engagements, would be the Residence of one of their Servants at Muscat, as a Check on his Conduct. It would be immater ial, whether such person resided in a private, or public Character, &amp; to obviate all objections of the Imaums, founded on his preteoded previous agreements with the Prench s &amp; Dutch, respecting a factory, it would perh aps be most advisable that he should be in the former, nor could the Imaum consistent with his late professions, make any reasonable objection to such a measure ; the grounds for the adoption of which might be justly rested on the English Government's desire of maintain ing uninterrupted, that harmony which was so obviously for his Benefit, &amp; which could not but be disturbed (at a period like the present) by the frequent Reports, which designing Men circulated of his Attention, &amp; favors to the Enemies of the British Nations. If he is sincere, in his desire of friendship, &amp; means to adhere to his Engagements, he cannot for a moment object to a proposition of so moderate a Nature; and if he does not entertain those principles of Amity, which he professes. It would be, perhaps, better on bis real Sentiments appearing obvious, that an explanation of the most explicit kind, should be made; in the Course of which he might be informed, that altho' the Company's Gov ernment was far from insisting on any other power, with which it was connected, entering into a War on its account; yet that where Engagements were contracted. Adherence was expected, &amp; that it would be folly in any State, but particularly one so situated in its Relation to the Company's Gov ernment at Muscat, to look for a Continuance of favor, &amp; exclusive Indul gence and Privileges. If it neglected the obvious means of securing these benefits by cultivating the friendship, &amp; strengthening the Confidence of the Company's Govt. In short, that it was better for the latter to be wholly unconnected with the Imaum, than to place any dependence on nominal Engagements ; which in fact answered no purpose, but that of lulling them into a dangerous Security. Such is the Language, which I should consider Calculated to have a favorable effect upon the Imaum; &amp; to incline him to observe a more ' circum spect line of Conduct; but, in this Subject, I venture my opinions with Diffidence &amp; having expressed them, shall conform in the strictest manner with the 578 f.d.370 wishes of your Hon'ble Board, agreeably to the Instructions I have received from the Right Hon'ble the Governor General. The object of the Fadsbaa of Bagdad, intimated thro' Manesty, appears one of a very general Nature; &amp; after an attentive Perusal of the Enclosures elucidatory of this point; I cannot see the smallest objection to my expressing that the increased Amity between the Sublime Porte, &amp; the English Gov*, makes the latter desirous that the Imaum should continue on terms of friendship with the Dependencies of the former, partioul arly that of Bagdad. I propose sailing about the 20- Instant, if a P acket from the Gulph arrives previous to that date; if not, I shall protract my departure, in the Hopes of that occurrence, for a few days longer.

Your Lordship having further required us to form a plan of such commercial arrangement with the Court of Persia, as may seem to us desirable ^he following observations are in this view submitted. 3. If, as may be presumed from Your Lordship's intimation of the des cription of Commercial Treaty intended to be established with Persia the trade is to remain free and open, without monopoly or engrossment of any kind, in favour either of the Company or individuals. We are of opinion with Mr. Maister and Mr. Fawcett, our Custom Master and Accountant General that not much of positive institution, is necessary, it being perhaps, only requisite to procure, in behalf of the Company a confirmation of their several privileges as far as they shall now be recoverable as specified in the said Eepor t and in behalf of the private merchants—to fix the rates of duty they shall pay at the different Sea Ports and to prescribe with as much clearness and certainty as possible, the Channel in which Commercial transactions are to be judged and decided on, in case of differences, and particularly how. debts to be recovered, and contracts enforced stipulating also for a free exercise of national and religious observance as far as local circumstances will admit, to all British and Indian merchants, dependent of the Company resorting to Persia for the purpose of Trade. 4. It may, however, be deemed altogether consistent with justice that neither British subjects nor the Company's Indian Dependants shall be allowed to trade with Persia, in those articles of English Staple, namely. Woolens, metals, and whatever other articles the Company may hereafter comprehend in their outward investment for Persia ; but this is a restriction which, perhaps JOHN MALCOLM, * Messrs. Maister and Pawcett's Report— Appendix Q-.I (S) 371 may be sufficiently enforced by internal Regulations at different presidencies as future events may render adviseable, without requiring to be inserted in tbe body of any Commercial Treaty that may be concerted. 5. Under these circumstances, provided that Persia continue in the enjoy ment of a settled Government; we have little doubt from tbe successful pro gress hitherto made by Mehedi Ally Khan, in the sale of woollens he took with him, that the Company's trade might in the Kingdom be still increased to greater extent than has hitherto been ever experienced in its most prosper ous periods. 6. Should your Lordship in Council think it adviseable for the Company to undertake a direct trade between India and Persia; we think there is a reason able prospect of its being rendered moderately and perhaps abundantly pro fitable in supplying that Country with the sugars of Bengal the Chintizes of Coromandel, and the Pepper and Cassia of Malabar ; all of which now form staple articles of this Commerce, as noticed in the more genuine modern account thereof—copies into the 21st Voucher to Messrs. Maisters and Pawcett, Heport above referred to ; the present profit upon which our President has been assured by the author of the statements own experience, clear not less than 50 per cent, upon an average to the Native Traders. The Company also might have this additional motive for entering into this speculation ; that, as the returns must, for the greater part, be made in bullion an additional source of supply might thence be derived to the Bombay Treasury that would assist the beneficial object of ensuring the most favourable exchange for the further Drafts that might be required from Bengal. 7. We forbear to enter on the subject of our territorial acquisition in the Gulph, for the purpose of establishing a respectable and perhaps, more secure mart of our Commerce in that quarter but should this ever become an object, the Islands either of Khruk or Hormuz, might perhaps be easily obtained to settle on, as has already been intimated in respect to the latter, in the corre spondence of the present Resident at Bushire.

We have great Reason to be satisfied with the Services of Mehedy Aly Khan, as Commercial Resident at Bushire, in which Station he has realised the Expectations expressed on his appointment in the Para, of our letter of the 3; d SepU above noticed, by disposing of all the Company's Staples at a Price in general as much above the Invoice rate, as for several years before they had sold below it. The Court of Directers have accordingly, from the hopes we early expressed to them of the good effects of this Nomination, considerably increased their Bushire Consignments, as we have been advised, by the Ships lately arrived at this Presidency.

In selecting you for this particular duty the Board have been guided by the confidence they repose not only in your professional ability, but in the descretion vigilance and foresight which may enable you to render the further political services that maybe required of you in view to which it is fit you should here be informed that the present Native Agent or Broker for the Hon ble Company at Muscat is Veshendas who has been directed to afford you every assistance and who of course must consider himself as subordinate to you in any political capacity you may have to exercise. He is properly speaking now acting as the Deputy Mehedi Ali Khan the Company's Resident at Bushire to whom on the removal of the former Broker for reputed connec tion with the French it was left to supply the vacancy by an Agent of his choosing in regard to which there is reason to believe he has not been parti cularly fortunate in as much as Veshendas is said to be the servant also of the Imaum and cannot therefore be fully or implicitly relied on for impartial reports of the latters conduct; but otherwise as Government have no special ground for mistrusting Vishendas further than as may arise out of his general situ ation it will neither be just nor consistent with good policy to betray any suspicion of him at least in the first instance and Government will therefore leave to Captain Malcolm s or your future experience to determine whether or not Vishendas may not continue to be still usefully employed as Native Agent at his present salary of 100 Rupees per month for which he draws occa sionally on the Presidency.374 Your own allowance is fixed at present at 500 Rupees per month exclu sive of your professional allowance which you may also from time to time draw on this Government for the amount of at the same rate as if employed in the Eield; both commencing from the 8th instant.

I had the honor of addressing Your Lordship from Muscat, under An agreement , , , Q , , « . signed by the ^ate the otn ultimo, and of informing you of my intention to proceed to the Island of Hormuz for the purpose of seeing the Imaum not meeting with him at that Port, I sailed for a Harbor between the Islands of Angar and Kishma, where I found him on the 17th ultimo on board the Ganjava, his principal- ship of War, at Anchor. 2. I immediately advised him of my mission, and repaired on board next morning and had the honor of presenting Your Lordship's letter, and some articles of value, which were received with every sense of friendship. 3. After a short, but explicit conversation, in the course of which, I explained in a concise manner, the late events in India, and the principles which had dictated Your Lordship's policy particularly as it related to Teppoo Sultaun. The Imaum expressed in the warmest terms his sense of the power and justice of the English Government, and his conviction that the prosperity of'tis' 377 the State he ruled depended on the continuance of that Friendship which now happily subsisted between him and the Honorable Company. 4. Finding him in so favorable a disposition, I proposed an Agreement* for his signature, which stipulated, in the first instance, for his strict perform ance of his former engagements, and in the second, for the Residence of an English Gentleman in a public character as the Agent of the Honorable Company's Government at the Port of Muscat. He assented to enter into this Agreement in the readiest manner, observing it was one obvio usly calculated for his advantage, as it opened, in the first instance, a channel through which he could daily improve his Friendship with the English, and inj the second, provided against those evils that might arise from future misrepresentation. 5. I have the honor to enclose a copy of the Agreement, with Translation. (The original is transmitted to Mr. Duncan.) I hope it will meet with Your Lordship's approbation. Although I had no specific instructions to conclude such an engagement, I thought, under the circumstances of the moment, that by doing so I was meeting in the fullest manner the wishes of the Govern ment of Bombay, to which Your Lordship directed me to attend in all matters that related to this negotiation. 6. The Imaum appears a Prince of a very active and enterprizing dis position, and is likely, from what I could observe, not only to preserve that power which he has usurped, but to improve it to a considerable extent. He is the first Merchant, as well as Sovereign of his Country, and protects his own property and that of his subjects by a navy which is by no means con temptible. His largest Vessel, the Gunjava, on board of which his Flag is generally hoisted, carries thirty-two Guns of different calibres—and is a ship of one thousand Tons burthen. He has three others, rigged and armed in the European manner, which carry each upwards of twenty Guns, and a numerous Fleet of well-appointed Arab Craft. He is now without a rival among the Arab Chiefs in this Quarter, and has taken possession of almost every Island in the Gulph that can facilitate the commerce of his Country with Persia and Turkey. In several of these, but particularly in Hormuz, he is making con siderable improvements; he looks forward to great advantage from this latter Island, in exporting its' natural produce of salt, and will, no doubt, make an early application for an increased privilege of importingthat article into Bengal. How far Your Lordship may be influenced by motives which relate to the Trade of India to reject or comply with this request when it is made, I am unacquainted ; but, as it is probable, if any commercial arrangements are made in this Quarter, that some Cessions either of duties, or of Territory, may be required of the Imaum, it occurs to me that witholding an indulgence of such consequence to him, as the Importation of Salt to Bengal, will be the best mode of securing his ready compliance with any demand that may here after be made as an equivalent; but I shall have occasion to speak more fully on this subject in a letter which I propose addressing to Your Lordship on the Trade to this Gulph. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect. My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble servant, Abushehrb, 1st of February y lS00.

Hon'ble Sib, I have the honour to inform you of my arrival at this Port after Agreement bigned a voyage which was protracted a few days by my negotiations with the Imame Dismissal of French* whom I fell in with on board one of the largest vessel lying in the anchor in the from hls harbour between the Island of Angar and Kishmis. To obviate those evils that service. had arose from misunderstanding between the two States, and to lay the foundation of a more intimate friendship I proposed to him to enter into an agreement which should stipulate in the first place for his future faithful per formance of engagements and in the second for the residence of an English Agent at the port of Muscat, and after a short discussion of some inferior points he agreed to comply with my propositions and affixed his seal to the orieinal agreement which I now enclose with accompanying translation, Altho' I had no special instructions to conclude an engagement of this nature I thought by doing so I was meeting in the fullest manner you wishes parti cularly as those are expressed in your letter of the 12th December 1799 and hope my conduct will be honoured by your approbation. I am well convinced that the Imame is sincere in his professions as he appears a man of sufficient penetration to understand his own interests which as he himself observed have been materially changed by the whole Court of Malabar falling into the possession of the English. After he had signed the agreement he informed me that lie had still five or six Frenchmen in hi s service all of which should be discharged the moment he returned to Muscat but that this measure would distress him a good deal if eight or ten Gunners were not sent from Bombay to supply their place. I promised him to address you on this subject and to request that you would if possible comply with his wishes. The native Broker at Muscat has conducted himself much to my satis faction and will, I have no doubt, be an useful man to Mr. Bogle or any gentleman that may in future reside at that port. I have in conformity with you wishes lost no time in discharging the Erigate and Captain Lalby proposes in sailing to-morrow.

Hon'ble Sir, By a vessel which sails this evening for Bombay I have the honor to acknowledge your letter dated Jany. 29th 1800 which I received about an hour ago on my landing from the Imaum ship the I had the honor to apprize you on the 30th ultimo of my intention to set gyei out from Muskat on the day following with the view to join Syed Sultaun Ormuz in consequence of his having intimated a wish to that purpose. Contrary winds however detained me here till the 6th current and on the 12th I reached that Island where 1 found His Highness on hoard the ship After a few days stay there, I at Augam occupied in making some necessary arrangements he proceeded towards Muska't but landed at Bushire 30 or 40 miles distant from this place in order to collect in that neighbourhood for his intended expedition against the Sheikh of Jultar, whose late piracies in the Persian Gulph have materially injured the trade of this port. In about three weeKs tms expedition will be ready to proceed as I shall again accompany the380 Imaum I hope to have it in my power to collect much useful information relative to his connexions in that quarter which my short stay there did not now admit of. thflmam 10688 0f I )ur i n g a daily and um-eserved intercourse with Syed Sultaun while at see I had frequently the pi easure to hear him express his satisfaction at having established a friendly correspondence with the English Government, this high sense of favour they had shewn him in attending to his late request. This disposition appears to be sanguine and in proportion as his attachment to the English has become warm &amp; sincere his dislike to the Erench seems to have increased. TheJ treatment he has recently from that Nation in the capture of his ships and from some individuals formerly employed in his service has greatly contributed towards this favourable change in his sentiments, in which it shall be my study to confirm him already indeed I have reason to think I have far succeeded as to have gained a share of his confidence of personal friendship. I am requested by him to intimate to your Hon'ble Board his desire to have eight or ten Englishmen sent from Bombay to serve on Board his ships as gunners and in lieu of the French and other foreigners, whom he has dismissed in compliance with your wishes. The same request was I believe made thro' Captain Malcolm but by some mistake he permitted to forward that Gentleman's letter till very lately. ^ K 1 ' ?T g , le , dire f' 1 received also on my arrival a letter from Capt.

Eespecting the Agent of the late Tippoo Sultaun of the purport of the Mysore Government at Muskat I formally made such enquiries, as I deemed warrantable from the nature of my situation, I could however gain no satis factory information on the subjec t but have reason to believe the purport was not considerable tho' whatever it may have been it is probable it was embezel- led by the Agents themselves. Soon after my arrival at Muskat they departed rather abruptly and it is said proceeded to Bownaghur instead of returning to their own country. It has been lately reported here, however, and generally credited that their vessel has been wrecked in the neighbourhood of Cutch. Should they in consequence return to this place I shall awail myself of every means in my power and take such steps as appear to me prudent and necessary to ascertain the truth the result I shall communicate to your Hon'ble Board and Mr. Lovett on his arrival. I shall also reserve for some future communication any mention of the Politics of this Government and its connexions, till a more extensive knowledge of the people and their interests acquired by a longer residence amongst them shall enable me to speak with more certainty and to judge of the proper sources from whence to draw my information.

Tanslation of a letter from Mehedy Ali Khan, Resident at Bushire, to the Hon'ble Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay, dated the 1st and received 28th August 1800 per Viper. You must no doubt, Hon'ble Sir, have received the fullest Accounts of the State of Affairs at Muscat from Doctor Bagle. I enclose you No. 1 an original letter received from Syed Seif, Regent at Muscat and father-in-Law to the Imam; together with a copy of my reply No. 2. He requests me to give him a letter of introduction to his Lordship the Governor Grenerfil, as it was his intention to go in person to Calcutta, stating him to be a friend and well- wisher of the Hon'ble Company at Muscat. A man, who was on board the ship that brought this letter who had come Movements of from Mokha to Muscat with coffee and from thence to Abushehr, states that Fiencl18lllps, he fell in with two French ships of force off Aden; that they boarded the Dhows, but on seeing the Arab Flag and pass permitted them to proceed ; and that they declared they were bound for Bussora and the Coast of Persia. In the meantime a two masted Vessel having in sight, the Frenchmen parted Company to give her chase. The Arabs know no more than this of these strangers; but if, Hon'ble Sir, what they say be true, we may expect on the course of the next ten or twenty days to hear of two French privateers appear ing in the Gulph of Persia. Now considering the old connection subsisting between this Nation and Muscat, and the respect with which they always treat the Vessels of that port, I cannot, in my own mind entirely acquit his High ness the Imam of at least some acquiescence in the expediency of their visit. I apprehend therefore, that it is a maxim not unknown in politics, that, whenever any seriously hostile designs are known to exist against the interest of any Empire or State, until the whole energies of that State can be applied to the reduction of the aggressors, it is unwise to render them altogether irreclaimable. Hopes of favor and accommodation ought rath er be held out until the Moment when the means of restribution are prepared, or you only magnify and mature the evil, before you have the power to represist. I have accordingly written to Syed Sief in the terms above noticed, and forwarded him the recommendation he desired to his Lordshi p, Copy of which also goes enclosed. The ambiguous connection, Hon'ble Sir, that at present subsists between The alnbiguoug the English Government and Muscat, being neither cordial friends nor open foees conuectio:Q between t ,. ' the English and the I cannot but look upon as productive of the most serious evils. Should they Imam ' however once lose all prospects of reconciliation with us, the next step would probably be a public co-operation with the enemy. The French would then again get a footing in the territory, and their ships fill the cove of Muscat. We should have to contend with multiplied foes and encreased resources ; and an important Communication would be for a long time shut. Should however his Lordship the Governor General find reason to .^P 0 ® 31 to sfcri k0 . .. ill o a d * 0 * a t once and anticipate the blow, no time could be more favourable to strike it. Their secure Maskat • Vessels are dispersed and they have no immediate external aid to rely on. I have also settled with the Court of Persia upon the subject. Your Honor may remember my having informed you, that I had made arrangements upon two important points, which I should Communicate on my return to Bombay, oneof these related to Muscat : of which place if you wish for a lease from the King it fs at your Service ; with troops also, upon condition of providing them with a conveyance. aptuS Karr a k aSU ^ wee ^ : a o 0 s,nce Sheik Nusser, in pursuance of the Eoyal Cotii- mands, went to take possession of Kharek Island at the head of 1500 men collected from the vicinity of Eushire. Shaik Nusser has succeeded in this Service, recovered the Isla nd from Syed Sultaun who had but a short time before seized upon it in person. The Uttoobies of Behrein have also commenced hostilities against Muscat : so that, if we were to an open rupture, we could not wish for a more favourable concurrence of circumstance and time. If on the Contrary it should be considered as a desertion of our real interest to do so, his Lordship will I am sure see in it's true light the propriety of otherwise of exas perating or Confirming them in their Spirit of enmity, as in the late instance of their Salt being seized upon by orders of Government. y E nclosure 1.

I forwarded that Letter to Seid Sultaun, and mentioned to him the permission which the Honb'le the Governor had granted^ in compliance with your request, and stated to him that whatever orders I received from him by those I should'act—I received an Order from my Master Seid Sultaun to put on board of two of my Ships ten thousand Maunds Bengal weight of salt, ihe names of which were Futta Ooomance and Futta Endroossee-~&amp;Ti&amp; in each- Ship lading five thousand Maunds to send them to383 Bengal, conformable to tbe privilege granted by the Honble the Governor. Agreeable to these commands of my Master I embarked the Salt on Board of these Ships, and sent them to bengal. It happened, that prior to the depar ture of those Ships, another letter of the same purport as the first was received from the Honble the Governor, which letter, with one from my Master Seid Sultaun, requesting the exemption of pilotage, was forwarded to Bengal. On the arrival of those Ships, I do not knew from what cause. The most noble the Governor General would not comply with what the Hon'ble Governor had written, neither would he grant an exemption from pilotage, the amount of which was received and the Salt having been weighed was taken possession of by the Government. I cannot comprehend on what grounds this has happened, it is necessary for me to write you, and acquaint you with it. Permission was given in two Letters one of which I have by me, and the other has been sent, this therefore is written for your information. S. P.—My valuable friend you must know that at this day except myself there is no other well-wisher of the Honble English Company at Muscat and what degree of credit and dishonor I have received, In one of my ships. I am now going accompanied by two of the Imaum's towards Calcutta, for the purpose of purchasing another. It is therefore proper that you should represent to the Right Hon'ble Lord Mornington the Services which I have performed and send tha t Letter to me which I shall carry with me and make / it known to his Lordship that alt ho' Seld Sultaun is my Master yet he is my son, and likewise let the good intentions of His Sircar towards the Com pany be known to his Lordship, that agreeable thereunto respect and atten tion may be shewn me. Enclosure, a. From Mehedy All Khan to Syed Self in reply^ dated 1st Rehy and avul 1215 or 24ta July 1800. I have had tbe honor of receiving vour agreeable Letter and cannot but Explaining why „ . , ., __ pilotage was levied. acknowledge the justice of your remarks upon my long silence. You will please however to recollect, that I have been absent for near a twelve month from Abusheher, and you will perceive the true and only cause—You may assure yourself of my earnest desire to preserve and cultivate our former friendship and that I intend in future to be as troublesome as I have lately been remiss in writing to you. You sav vou have received two Letters from the Hon'ble the Governor Exemption grant- iPiAi- edas conipensau&amp;a of Bombay respecting the allowance of ten thousandmaunds ot salt to be imported for exclusion of the upon two ships, and their exemption from the pilot fee in Bengal. To Fiench - this, as having been the original mediator between the two Governments, I have only to say, that, in some measure to indemnify the Sultaun for the loss he might experience from the exclusion of the French, I thought it my duty to represent to the English Government the justice of your request to be allowed such and such privileges. The request was complied with, and the Sunnud you have accordingly in your possession. Soon after however a Erench Ship arrives at Muscat, received every kind But the imam of Supply and accommodation on the Score of old acquaintance, falls in with Jent 18 agree 'an English Cruizer, and both blow up. The Fearl, fresh captured from the English, with a crew of the same Nation, next makes her appearance, and the Erench and the inhabitants of Muscat buy and sell her cargo without impe diment ; amongst the rest, some horses belonging to Mr. Manesty, the Resident at Bussora, together with different articles of mine. The Government at the same time shows nothing but the most friendly disposition towards them. What was his Lordship the Governor General to suppose but that the old intercourse between Muscat and the Erench still continued, and that the former had really experienced no injury or loss from the pretended dissolution of their Connection ? Why then provide for an imdemnification, as in the instance of the Salt grant, to the amount of thirty or forty thousand Eupees ? These were not even wanting informers, who assured His Lordship of the existence of a positive alliance between you and the Erench; and, as the proverb says, 'the friend of my enemy is no friend of mine', I cannot but think it both natural and likely that His Lordship did on this account order the detention of the Cargo of Salt. Permit me therefore to offer you in one word the amount of my sentiments on the occasion which I do, believe me out of the most sincere regard for your interest, as well as in remembrance of the favour and kindness of the deceased Imaum, which I preserve to this day unaltered, look upon the friendship and esteem of the English Govern ment as the Soul by which Muscat breathes and has its' being, and fly the Continuation of Erench fraternity as you would the plague. As to the introduction, which you express a desire to carry with you to the Most Noble the Governor General, I have in deference to your request presumed to address His Lordship on the subject: otherwise, I can assure you I would not have dared to Conceive that any intervention of mine could have been necessary between persons in every respect so superior. Shall Soha (an obscure star) expatiate to the lamp of day upon the elfulgency of the Lunar firmament ?' The enclosed Arzy, however, you will find to Contain what you desire. Let me recommend you then in every instance to have the favorable consideration of the Honorable Company and His Lordship the Governor General in view, and drive the Erench like flies away from you. When the Govern ments of Bengal and Bombay are thoroughly assured of your sincerity in this particular, the advantages which will be unceasingly derived to Muscat will, I doubt not, convince you of the policy of the measure. CCXCIII. Translation of a letter from Mehedy Ali Khan, Resident at Bushire, to the Honorable Jonathan Duncan, dated 2nd (received 28th) August 1800. I had the honor of forwarding by a former Conveyance a bill upon the Bengal Government in favour of Mirza Mahommed Ali Khan, in the Service of the Nizam at Calcutta, for Eupees 15,000, due to Hajy Ali Akbar and Mirza Mahommed, Merchants, on account Goods received from them and employed as presents to the different Members and Officers of the Persian Government. This I did in compliance with their request, having no correspondent at Bombay, and agreed to produce the receipt of Mirza Mahommed Ali in four Months. I trust therefore, Honorable Sir, you will enable me to fulfill my en gagement, as beyond the prescribed period they will make a demand of interest.385 ✓ A very extraordinary Circumstance has lately taken place here. letters had been received from the Hindoos and other inhabitants of Muscat, stating F^ShTp.' o£ that two French Ships of force had been seen between that place and Aden. As it so happened, the Brig Shannon imported here and landed h^r packet on the 28th July, and on the evening of the same day arrived a two masted English Merchant Vessel from Cochin. Next morning they both proceeded to Bussora ; and about noon a Ship of War have in sight, the flag war accordingly hoisted, but she passed on without touching at the Bunder, We were all in the greatest amazement at this proceeding, wondering, why, if she were an English Vessel, the Captain at least did not come on shore ; when all of a sudden a firing of guns was heard, and near twenty distinct reports counted. It no longer in short remained a doubt, but that this was a French Ship and that she was engaged with the two English Brigs. The Firman, which I had obtained from his Majesty, ordering the deten tion of any of the French Nation that might appear, was unfortunately at Sharaaz in the possession of Major Malcolm who had sent for it some time before. It accordingly struct me, if I could get on board one of the English Vessels with ten or twenty such people at the as the place afforded, if, as I had no doubt, she bad guns on board, that we might not be altogether useless. Let God's will be done for the rest. With this view I hired a botella for the sum of 300 Kroosh ; and agreed with the owners, that, m case I was killed and the boat taken, they should receive a remuneration of 3,000 more from the Factory. In the mean time a packet came in from Captain Malcolm, enclosing me the Firman, after he had perused it. As N usser Khan therefore was then at Kharek with ten Vessel and 1500 men ; and as it was no positive duty of mine to fight the French, I thought it more advisable to send him the Firman which 1 did with a Letter from myself, saying, that he had now such a force with him, and that if, obedience to the Royal diploma, he was to make a Capture of the privateer, it would be ensuring him the applause and admiration of both kingdoms. I agreed also to give him from myself, in recompense for his Services—ten thousand piastres for the Ship's papers. This I dispatched without loss of time; but next morning I had the satisfaction to hear, that all our fears had been groundless ; that the stranger was an English Ship carrying a Europe packet from the Red Sea, with which she was making the best of her way to Bussora. One of the officers on board states, that the French formed the design of sending 30,000 men by land against Judda, to convey information of which to Europe was the object of her present voyage. It appears indeed from the Letters of Merchants in Syria and Aleppo, that the French were never in firmer possession of Egypt than they are at this moment. CCXCIV. From the Governor of Bombay to the Resident at Bushire, dated 29tli September 1890. I have been favored with your two Letters of the 1st and 2nd of August and have duly understood their contents. Your answer of the 1st of Rebby al awal to the application to you from Sheikh Seif was a very proper one; and as the treating of the same subject I a y386 forward for your Notice Copies of one I have just received from him, of the 1st of Eebby essany together with my answer of this date, and the one to the Imaum of Muscat therein referred to under date the 28th of January last, together with the Imaum's Reply thereto on which I desire to have your sentiments how far you understand the sentiments therein expressed to be conformable to your sense of the Letter and Spirit of the Cowlnama or Convention you concluded with the Imaum—you will also write whether you clearly explained to the Imaum or to Shaikh Seif that the Salt shipped by the Imaum was to be accompanied by a Letter or Certificate from our Broker at Muscat to ascertain it's being that Prince's own Property as from the answers now received from them—and particularly the one from Shaikh Seif it seems inferrible that they considered the Imaum's own writing to be a sufficient attestation in that respect—as appears more particularly from the P. S. to Shaikh Seif's Letter wherefore it becomes the more necessary that you should advise whether, and if so, in what manner the Condition in question as to the English Vakeel's Letter being necessary was clearly notified to the Imaum and Sheikh Seif or either of them, according to the intimation to this Effect in your Letter of the 4th of December 1798. The Bill mentioned in your Letter of the 2nd August was transmitted to Bengal on the 6th of that Month, to which no answer has yet been received ; but there is no doubt it has been duly accepted. The Exertions you made on the supposition of the arrival of a Erench Ship of war in your neighbourhood, were very commendable, as has been your general conduct as Resident throughout and if you can now advantegeously dispose of the large quantity of Woolens which the Hon'ble Company have in Confidence they have placed in your assurances, sent out this year for your factory to a much larger amount than for many years before (as per Invoice thereof already forwarded) your Commercial Credit with them will be as fully established as has already been your political Dexterity : I depend there fore in this respect on your most cordial Exertions. Dated 29 th September 1800. ccxcv. To The M ost N oble M arquis W ellbsley , Governor General. Fort William. My Lord, Reporting about 1 had last tlie llonor of addressing your Lordship under date the 12th ed'wU^Persia. 0111 ^* U ' ltim ^ ) » Teheraun, stating my having succeeded in concluding two Treaties, one of a political and the other of a Commercial nature, and of in forming your Lordship at the same time of my resolution to march imme diately for Baghdaud a resolution not only in conformity to what I had before expressed, but which was the only mode I had left of bringing to a speedy conclusion a negotiation that became every moment more difficult, and which would, if I had consented to remain at Court, have been (from the easy dis position of the King, and the intriguing spirit of his ministers) probably pro- tracted to a remote period, if not altogether ^defeated. 2nd. As I did not receive the original Treaties till a few hours before I left Teheran, it was impossible for one to transmit Copies of them to Your387 Lordship. These I have now the Honor to enclose with Translations,* and it * Ait c h i s o n s but remains to take a view of the reasons that have guided my judgement in the Volume 3 x) pa gU Conduct of this important mission, and to express my anxious hope that such 37—4o • will prove satisfactory to Your Lordship. 3rd. I shall first take a retrospect of the progress and accomplishment of the Political objects to^which Your Lordship directed my attention; secondly, of the Commercial; and, lastly observe on the causes that induced me to admit of a departure from the usual forms in the drawing out of the Treaties con cluded. 4th. In the Instructions which I received from Lieutenant Colonel Kirkpatrick under date the 10th of October 1799, my attention was directed by Your Lordship to two Political objects of importance the first to prevent Tumaun Shauh from invading Hindoostan and the second to engage the King of Persia to act vigorously and heartily against the French, in the event of their attempting to penetrate to India by any quarter that it might be practi cable for him to oppose their progress. 5th. In pursuing the first of these objects, my consideration was called to two points; one to provide against any invasion of India for three years, the period respecting which I learned from my Instructions there was most solici tude ; and the other to_obtain, if 4 I could, on equitable conditions,] additional security to the British Possessions in India (should I discover from my Intel ligence that Shauh Tumaun was likely hereafter to receive his scheme of Invasion) by concluding with the King of Persia a Treaty of defensive nature calculated to curb the ambition of the Afghan monarch. 6th. Prom the date of my instructions, I of course considered that the seasons 1800, 1801 and 1802 were those in which Your Lordship was most desirous to prevent Invasion, and it appeared that if I succeeded in accom plishing that point the negotiations relative to the primary object of my mission became less urgent, and more likely from that circumstance to^be con cluded on equal terms. 7th. By my former dispatches, Your Lordship was fully informed of the events of last season. In the operations of which, though the King of Persia was unsuccessful, his advance into Khorassaun brought Shauh Tumaun to this quarter, and removed all apprehensions of his Invading India in 1800, , and the lateness of the season at which he returned to Kabul joined to the alarm which that * prince must have taken on hearing of a mission so splendid as that with which I was charged reaching the Court of Persia at such a period, left me ^ without a doubt of his abandoning all thoughts of prosecuting his intentions against Hindoostan for the year 1801. The ensuing season of 1802 only remained, and it seemed to be of ultimate importance to use every endeavor that could aid in keeping off all danger for that year. No means appeared so likely to produce that effect as the advance of the King of Persia into Khorassaun in the spring of eighteen hundred and one ; as such a movement could not fail of bringing Shauh Tumaun to Heraut, and of detaining him near that city till the commencement of next winter. 8th. Although the two last campaigns of the King of Persia in Khorassaun had disheartened his army not a little, and there were not wanting counsellors who wished to divert him from so ardous an enterprise as the reduction of the j province, and to persuade him to turn his arms to other directions. It was A388 however clear that his Majesty could not but be aware that he had by his operations in that quarter obtained the notice of the English Government, and that it was only by a perseverance in the same steps that he could hope successfully to cultivate an alliance that gave such promise of adding to his power and reputation, and it therefore followed that while he considered that alliance as an object he would never abandon the measures by which it could alone be preserved. Viewing circumstances under the light, I determined immediately after my arrival at Teheraun to confirm the king by a very liberal present, in the inclination he shewed to improve the connection with the English Government, and to ensure his continuance (at least for a period) in that line of Policy which evidently formed the chief link of friendship between him and that state with this resolution, which was chiefly founded on my knowledge of the king's private character. I had soon reason to congra tulate myself, as my conduct gave such satisfaction to His Majesty that he did not hesitate Xn early giving me the most unqualified assurances of his fixed resolution to renew his attack on Khorassaun next season. 9th. The temporary object of my mission relative to Shauh Tumaun appeared answered by this step, but as I had reason to conclude from every information, since I had arrived in Persia that the Invasion of Hindoostan was not only a favourite project of that monarch, but likely from a variety of circumstances to be so, with every prince of ambition at the head of the Afghan Government, and one which nothing but the means of defeating could ever present being put into execution, I thought it of consequence to enter into defensive engagements with the Government of Persia to avert that evil, both now and hereafter, and was so far successful as to convince that Court that its Interest was no less concerned than that of the Honorable Company, in taking precautions to prevent the further aggrandizement of either Shauh Tumaun or his successors. 10th. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th articles of the enclosed Political Treaty will shew Your Lordship the stipulations that had been made on this point, which I trust, will meet with Your approbation. If the present Government of Persia proves stable, and the peace between it and the Honorable Com pany remains undisturbed a more effectual check to prevent any Invasion of India by the Afghans could not have been discovered. 11th. On the second political object of my mission, I trust I may say that Your Lordship's wishes have been fully accomplished. The stipulations con tained in the 5th and 6th articles of the same Treaty, are as decisive as could be desired, and the arguments I used to persuade the king to comply with this part of the Treaty, have, I hope, made impressions that it will not be easy to erase, and I dare venture to assure Your Lordship that there is little appre hension during the present Sovereign's Reign of any Erench influence being established at the Court of Persia. 12th. The enclosed Commercial Treaty, will, I anxiously hope, meet with Your Lordship's approbation, as it appears to me calculated to increase the intercourse between the subjects of the two states to inspire confidence and to augment the sales of the Honorable Company's staples in Persia. 13th. By the articles of this Treaty, all priviledges that the Eactories of the Honorable Company formerly enjoyed in Persia are restored, several more granted, and the Duties collected from the purchasers of staples, which have of389 v» late years been four, and were never less than two and a half, are now reduced to one P. cent. 14th. The conditions on the part of the Honorable Oompany are of the most general nature, and calculated more to give the Treaty an equitable appearance than to burthen the English Government with any serious engage ments. That contained in the additional article, by which it is stipulated that the present duties on the Goods which constitute the Trade between the two nations shall not be increased, is the only exception to this remark, and it was one which I could not on every principle of justice refuse to make. 15th. I endeavored, in consequence of Your Lordship's Instructions, con tained in Lieutenant Colonel Kirkpatrik's Letter of the 13th of July 1800, to obtain a cession of the Island of Kishma, but discovering that such was likely to be attended with difficulty and that the King of Persia wished to connect it with other points relative to possessions in the Gulph, that, I by no means considered myself authorised to treat upon, I contented myself with keeping this point of the negotiation open, for the final settlement of Your Lordship ; it was, in consequence, inserted in the additional article of the Treaty that the further arrangements relative to the commerce between the two states was entrusted to Han zee Khulleel Khaun, who is appointed Ambassador to Your Lordship, and on this subject I can only add my conviction that if circum stances hereafter lead Your Lordship to desire this cession that it will be easily effected. 16th. It now only remains to account to Your Lordship for the deviations from Eorm that I have been obliged to admit in the enclosed Treaties, and to state, the reasons, that governed my conduct in this particular, I shall first presume to mention in a general manner the leading causes that seriously operated against my forming any treaties whatever with this state, and then detail the circumstances that have prevented the engagements I have con cluded being as correct in point of Form as I could have wished. 17th. The Government of Persia which is I imagine at once the most prejudiced, proud and absolute in the world, is a total stranger to regular Engagements. Papers and Letters by which peace has been established have no doubt often been written by its kings, ministers and Generals, but such, as far as my information goes, have always been most loose and desultory, and in total opposition to all forms on similar occasions in Europe. 18th. This government has ever considered the English as well as the other European Nations, as Traders and merchants that benefited by a commerce with Persia, and, as such, has often granted them Firmans of protection, and privilege but never thought for a moment of entering into any regular alliance with them. It is true the late acquisitions of the British Government in India, (indistinctly related by merchants) has within these few years spread the fame of that nation, but the Persians have still a very inadequate idea of its greatness and power, and it is almost impossible to explain to them the nature of the Honorable Company's Government, and of the delegated Powers vested in the Governor General in a manner to satisfy them of the latter's competency to treat immediately and on a footing with an independent Sovereign. The ignorance of the Empire over which he presides, and the want of knowledge of the customs of civilized Nations caused in the present instance the king of Persia to make objections on this head which though I was able to evade, I could never entirely remove.19th. I before informed Your Lordship under date the 17th of November, that I insisted on a Person being vested with Powers to Treat with me Hanjee Ibrahim Khan, the Prime minister, was accordingly appointed by a Fumaun, copy of which, with a translation, I enclose. After I had settled with that minister the different articles of the Treaties, two points of magnitude in respect to Form obtruded. One relative to the king's ratifying the Treaties in the manner I wished by putting his seal at the bottom, and the other to having an English Translation adjoined. The Eumaun appointing Hanjee^Ibraheem Khan, to treat with me was, the ministers of the Persian Court contended, sufficient to make the Treaties valid, and as to the king's putting his seal below mine or. of his own ministers which he must, if he ratified the Treaties at the bottom, it was, they urged, at variance with the habits of the Persian monarchy from the earliest ages, and on the present occasion was more improper, as Your Lordship with whom the alliance was contracted, though the acknowledged Euler of a great Empire, yet still you were only, as it appeared from my credentials, the delegati of a sovereign. As to the English Translation they argued that it was a point in itself immaterial ; that it was evident no person at the Court of Persia understood that Language, and it would therefore appear extraordinary if such was inserted in a Treaty given to me for Your Lordship, but there could be no objection to the Treaties that were returned from India for the king of Persia being written in both Languages, if it was a point to which consequence was attached. 20th. After a dispute that continued several days, I at last agreed to dispense with the English Translations, and also with the king's placing his seal at the bottom, on condition that a Eirmaun of His Majesty directed to- His officers should be affixed to each of the Treaties, concluded between Hanjee Ibraheem Khaun me, informing them of these Treaties being contract ed by his desire, and authority, and requiring obedience and conformity to such throughout his Dominions, and that the Treaties sent from India to the king should ..be notified by Your Lordship in a similar manner having an order requiring submission to what was concluded with the Honorable Company' 8 seal affixed. This expedient which appeared to me to render the Treaties perfectly valid, without sacrificing the dignity of either party was after much discussion adopted. 21st. There are lesser irregularities in the Treaties, such as the very long and unnecessary preambles, and the mode of expressing the Honorable Com pany's Government, which is always termed the Government of the king of England, which I could not avoid without entering into disputes that I did not think the points inserted, and in fact (for such is the attachment of the Persians to their own Forms) incurring some risk of defeating the whole nega- tiation. 22nd. In concluding this letter, which is, I fear already too prolix, I cannot avoid expressing the state of anxiety in which I shall remain till I learn Your Lordship's sentiments on the conduct I have observed in the progress and ter mination of this mission. JOHN MALCOLM, Envoy.891 CCXIVL To The Most noble M arquis of W ellesley Governor General, Fort 'William., My Lord, I have the honor to inform Your Lordship of my arrival at this port, to which I hastened on learning at Baghdad that the ship Governor Duncan was detained for my accommodation to India. 2. I had last the Honor of addressing Your Lordship at Humadaun from which city I marched the moment the severity of the season made it praci- cable, and on the 22nd of March reached Baghdad. 3. The attentions I received in the Persian Dominions, on my return from Court were, if possible, greater than those paid me on my journey to it, and the uncommon rigor of the season gave them a tenfold value. On my entering the Turkish Dominions I was met by a mehamadan by whom I was liberally entertained on the road, and at Baghdad, I was treated in a manner the most flattering and distinguished. 4. I had the honor of presenting Your Lordship's letter to Suleimaun Pashaw who appeared much gratified by the attentions and gave me a reply to deliver to 'Y our Lordship. 5. I have met at Bussora with the same honorable treatment that I experienced at Baghdad, and have found all ranks solicitious to shew by personal attentions to me the high respect they entertain for Your Lordship. 6. I trust Your Lordship will pardon my mentioning the sense I have of the kindness and attention of the Honorable Company's Eesidents at Bussora and Baghdad. Mr. Manesty and Mr. Jones, who have on all occasions, but particularly since I entered the Turkish Dominions, exerted themselves to obtain for me (as Your Lordship's agent) the most honorable reception and treatment, and I cannot but greatly impute the extraordinary marks of respect I have received, to the well established Influence of these Gentlemen at their respective places of Residence. 7. The Expedition with which I came to Bussora obliged me to leave Captain Campbell and all the Gentlemen of the Mission, except Mr. Strachey, at Baghdad with the Escort and the majority of the followers. I have however given orders for them to follow with as little delay as possible, and have made arrangements with Mr. Manesty by which their conveyance to India will be much facilitated, and little expense incurred on that account to Government. 8. I propose embarking the day after to-morrow, on the Governor Duncan for Bombay. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient and most humble servant, JOHN MALCOLM, Envoy. B ussora ; 11th April 1801.APPENDICES.395 APPENDIX A.

King James, whose fame and glory God grant may never have an end, the privileged and renowned Christian Edward Connocke who brought with him letters, adorned with sincere affection, love and amity, to the end he might establish on both parts knowledge, friendship and unity; the which ambassador, in declaring and publishing before the high majesty of Shah Abas, now in Paradise, the union and bonds of freiendship which was desired, gave to understand that for the future the English nation as merchants, etc., should come with their merchandises both by land and sea into all parts of the dominions and seignories of the mighty King of Persia, for the furtherance of trade and commerce and increasing of knowledge, love and amity on both sides, and that the merchants and subjects of the great majesty of Persia might with tranquillity of mind go with their merchandises into those ports; which was acceptable unto the Majesty of Shah Abas, now in Paradise. Further the said Ambassador signified unto the high majesty of Shah Abas that the only intent of his master. King James, supreme in majesty and of a high degree, was that there might be writings drawn between the Highness of Shah Abas, now in Paradise, and the Majesty of King James to the furtherance of friendship and correspondency (which writings are here beneath contained), and that between these two crowns there may perpetually remain a declaration of the said grants and agreements.

At what time soever as the said English nation shall arrive with their ships to any of the ports belonging to the King of Persia, or shall travel by land with their merchandise the Governors of the said ports or places whersoever they come shall not exact from them one farthing more than the accustomed duties which my own subjects pay. 3. Whatsoever is necessary, as victuals, munition, &amp;c., shall be sold unto the eaid nation for the furnishing their shipping at the same rates and prices my own subjects pay. 4. If by chance there happen any torment or tempestuous storm where the English ships shall ride, and that any of the said ships suffer shipwreck (which God forbid), no ma.n whatsoever shall pretend anything thereof, but shall suffer the said nation in the best manner they can to save their goods and make the most of all things thereof. If any person take anything thereof, they shall restore it again. 5. Whatsoever goods the said nation shall import (into?) our dominions, they may carry it to whatsoever place in my country they please, buying and selling freely, nobody molest ing them, or offer (ing) them any force on violence. 6. They shall buy whatsoever sort of merchandise they list, nobody hindering them. 7. They shall live in their own laws and religion, and no man compel them by violence to turn Mussellman; for as religion is a work which proceeds from the conscience and mind398 which pleads between the creature and the Creator, so nobody but the high Majesty of God hath power to penetrate the said conscience ; and God it is above unto whom all men are to render an account of their salvation. Bat if any of the said nation shall voluntarily turn Mussell- man, he shall live m any part of my dominions he lists, possessing quietly that belongs unto him. 8. They shall keep whatsoever sort of arms or weapons in their houses, and' if in their travels any person shall steal anything from them, and they in defence thereof kill him the Governors of that jurisdiction shall not molest them for it •, but if they apprehend the the thief and carry him before the magistrate, he shall in their presence give him punish ment. 9. At what time soever any ambassador shall come from the high Majesty of the King of England, he hath power to constitute in [any part of my dominions agents' and factors for the negotiating their business, and our Governors and supreme ministers of such places shall respect them and assist them in all occasions. 10. If any man of their people shall commit any disorders, they shall be carried before the said Ambassador to have chastisement. 11. In whatsoever part any of the said nation shall reside, and nobody offer them force or violence, they shall acquaint the governor of those parts thereof. If he deny them justice they shall appeal unto the Ambassador which is in my Court, and he informing our Royal Person thereof, we shall severely chastise such abuses. 12. If in any part whatsoever there shall be any servant or interpreter of the said nation in whom they themselves put trust and confidence, they* (shall ?) give credence * The governors P unto him, and respect him in the like, manner as if he were one of the said nation. 13. If from any parts of Turkic, or other places whatsoever, any man shall bring any slaves of the English nation, if he be not turned Mussellman, he shall be delivered unto the said nation, they paying only the price he cost. 14. If any of the said nation die in any part of my dominions, that no man offer to take one farthing of his goods, but that the said Ambassador dispose thereof as he see good and that the corpse of the said deceased be interred in places where other Christians bury. 15. If the said English shall not find want for such commodities as they bring, accor ding to their content, they may transport it through my country into any other ports what soever, paying only the accustomed duties my own subjects pay, and as they do in Constanti nople and Alepo and other ports of Turkei. If anything be stolen from them on the way, the governors of those parts shall make seardh for the thief; and finding him, shall restore the said goods; if not, the said Governors shall make good what was stolen, 16. If between the said nation and our subjects happen any difference or discord in buying or selling, they shall repair unto the Justice, who shall do them right according to the ancient laws of this land. But if the said difference pass or exceed, twenty , tomans, the Justice shall send them to the Ambassador to be decided, that he in presence of our Justices might do whatsoever shall be comfortable to honourable and noble laws. 17. If any of the said nation shall marry a wife of any of those Christians in our country, if he have any issue, and should die, leaving the said children destitute of j friends to protect them, they shall in such cases be delivered to the disposure of the Ambassador. 18. That no soldier, merchant, rustic or whatsoever person in my dominions, nay, the said English themselves, shall not break these conditions, for that the High Majesty of Shah Abas, the conqueror of the world, hath accepted and allowed thereof. Now know that in this blessed time, since our potent and royal person hath succeeded with prosperity to this crown, the English Captain hath made petition unto us for our royal firnand for confirmation of all such conditions heretofore made and allowed by the Majesty of Shah Abas, now in Paradise, and for establishing the union and bands of friendship, love and amity between Us, the potent King of Persia, and the high Majesty of the King of England. Whatsoever we, having considered and received the said conditions made by Shah Abas now in Paradise, have not derogated one point from the same, but by our royal firman d which is firm and stable) have accepted and allowed thereof in the same manner as was399 established by Shah Abas and as is above written. Wherefore we command all Channes, Vice-Kings, honoured Governors, soldiers, merchants, and all other inferior ministers what soever, that the said conditions, which the high Majesty of Shah Abas established, and we at present re-establish between Us, the potent King of Persia, and the defender of empires and powers, the high Majesty of the King of England, be truly observed and kept, and that there be not anything done opposite to those bands of friendship, love, union, benevolence and charity; and those that shall do contrary to these conditions shall receive condign punish ment from our royal person. Wherefore know that this our royal firmand is firm, just and true. Given in the moon Ziadja, 1038. No copy of the farman obtained by Edward Connock in 1617 can be found among the contemporary records; but we have here printed a farman granted by Shah Safi, the successor of Shah Abbas, in Zu'l-hijjah A. H. 1038 (July-August, 1629), which recites and confirms the grant procured by Connock. This is taken from a collection of translations of farman which was sent home to the company in 1629 or 1630, as is shown, by a reference to' the present Agent Mr. William Burt' (who died in November, 1630). It is now in the Factory Records series at the India Office (Persia, Vol. I.). Though the treaty is stated to be an exact copy of the original farman, and probably is sufficiently close for all practical purposes, it must be admitted that there are reasons for thinking that there were at least some differences between the two documents. In the first place (though this is trivial) the original clearly contained twenty articles and not eighteen. This is expressly stated by Barker (0. C., No. 792); and later editions of the privileges (Cp. that in/. O., Records Treaties, Wol. t;, which purports to be a copy of the grant as confirmed, by Shah Sultan Hussain) make twenty by splitting Nos. 9 and 15 into two articles each. In the second place, it is emphatically stated both by Barker and Monox that the clause about the payment of customs required a payment of ten per cent. duty. The former writers (0. C., No. 792V 'In the 18th article of the said compitulations it is contracted (however, since contradicted) that we shall pay unto the King ten per cent, custom of all goods either brought into or exported out of his land and the latter says (O. C., No. 586, ii. that the Shah at a later date hath graciously re- mitted the payment of any manner of customs by as whatsoever, acknowledgeth it was never his meaning to tie ue to the payment of any, albeit it is plainly set down in the capitulation that we were to pay one in ten, as at Constant imple and Allepo, though otherwise translated by Mr. Connock, as per the copy sent you by the 'Bee.' The Hague Transcripts at the I. 0., (Series I, Vol. ii., No. cxvii) include an undated document in French eontaining a list of articles granted to the English. Apparently, however, these are of a later date than Connock 'a mission.400 n: APPENDIX D.

The difficulties whicb. have been encountered, in the present attempt, to form a correct report, of the past and present state of the commerce of Arabia and Persia, have been very- numerous, and highly discouraging. Particular Exertions have been however made, to collect every attainable Information on the subject, and therefore although the report must prove^ in many respects deficient and incompleat, yet it is hoped that it will give a useful Idea of the Commerce in question, and enable the British Government in India to form a Judgment, how far it may be expedient to engage therein. With a view of giving clearness to the report, it has been determined to divide it, under the following general Heads :— Commerce of Arabia, Commerce of Persia, Remarks applicable to the Commerce of both Countries, C ommekce op A rabia. It has been deemed necessary to separate the Information which has been collected, on the subject of the commerce of Arabia, under the following Heads Commerce of Arabia bordering on the PersianlGulph, Commerce of tbe Red Sea, C ommerce op A rabia bordering on the P ersian G ulph. The Want of public Records, and the Difficulty of obtaining satisfactory Information of old Past state of the occurrences from the Inhabitants of Arabia, boi'derin^ on the Persian Gulph, have unavoidably prevented the Formation of any, very precise statement, of the past general Commerce of that on the Persian part of the World, or of the commercial intercourse which the British Nation has formerly had therewith ; and have given Birth to a necessity, of commencing the Information relative thereto, which will be here submitted to the public consideration, at the Period of the Removal of the English Factory from the Port of Gombroon. Muscat is a Sea Port, situated in Oman, a province of Arabia Felix, r l he Decline of the Commerce of Gombroon, animated the Arabs, of the Province of Oman to those Exertions which on its Extinction, gave rise to the Commercial Importance, which the port of Muscat has latterly acquired. Previous to the above mentioned Period, the Province of Oman, naturally sterile and unproductive, was a very poor Country, and the commerce of Muscat was confined within very narrow Limits. The pecuniary advantages, which accrued, to the Inhabitants of Muscat from their first important mercantile Adventure, encouraged them, however, to the active, and enterprizing prosecution, of an extensive commerce with India with the Red Sea and with the different ports of the Persian Gulph. By Degrees, tbe Dows and Dingies belonging to Muscat, increased in Number and Size, the Imaum of Muscat furnished himself, with a respectable Fleet, private Merchants of that place, caused square rigged vessels of different kinds and considerable Burthen, to be constructed for them in different Parts of India, and the Port of Muscat, became frequented by the Vessels of European Nations. Commerce is a never failing source of Wealth and it has rendered Muscat a more rich and a flourishing Sea Port, than any of those bordering on the Persian Gulph. Bahreen is an Island of inconsiderable circumference, situated on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulph in the vicinity of lebarra and Catiffe. Bahreen was long under the Jurisdiction of the Persians till, in the year 1783, the Arabs of the Tribe of Beneattaba, who then held Possession of Sea Ports of lebarra and Grain, and who by their spirited resistance of the frequent attacks made on their Vessels by the Fleet of the Chaub Shaik and by the armed Vessels of Persia, were then becoming respectable in the Persian Gulph, made an active and successful Exertion to obtain Possession thereof, by Force of arms. In the same year, the late Shaik Nassir, then Shaik of Busbire, collected the remaining Naval Force of Persia, proceededto Bahreen, and made an unfortunate attempt to recover the Island from the Arabs, The Loss which the Persians sustained, in an engagement with the Arabs, was very consiaerable and their remaining vessels returned to Bushire. Since that Period/ the Arabs have held peaceful Possession of the Island, without any further attempts having been made by the Persians for its recovery. Bahreen derives consequence and value from its ancient and exten sive Pearl Fishery, which has yielded the finest Pearls, that have made their appearance in the world, and which in all times, has given Wealth to its' Possessors. The Commerce of Bahreen, independent of the Pearl Branch has till latterly been very inconsiderable. Catiffle is a Sea Port, situated on the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph, and is in the Possession of the Arabs of the tribe of Benechalid. lebarra is a Sea Port situated on the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph and, as has been already remarked, is in the Possession of the Arabs of the Tribe of Beneattaba. The Sea Ports of Catiffe and lebarra have always partaken, but in an inconsiderable Degree, of the benefits arising from the beforementioned Pearl Fishery •, and independent of that Branch their Commerce, has been in all Times chiefly confined to the Importation cf the Coffee, and of such Indian and European mercantile Articles, as have been found necessary for their own consumption and for the consumption of the Arab Tribes of Whahab and Benechalid, who are People little acquainted with any of the Luxuries of Life and who inhabit the extensive Deserts which lie to the Southward and Westward of that Part of the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulph. Till within or few years past the Indian and European Articles, imported at lebarra and Catiffe, were conveyed from Muscat, in a vessel belonging to that port to Catiffe. The acquisition of Bahreen has latterly, however, encouraged the Arabs of the Tribe of Beneattaba, who inhabit that Island to &lt; purchase Vessels proper to perform voyages from thence to India and to employ them in such voyages. They have been thereby enabled to convey Pearl in a direct manner to Surat, and annually to import at lebarra and Catiffe, a principal Port of the necessary supplies of Indian and European mercantile Articles before, mentioned without paying thereon the duties, to which they were liable, when conveyed through the channel of Muscat. Grain is a Sea Port, situated on the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph and near the head of it. It has been long in the Possession of the Arabs of the Tribe of Beneattaba, and it hag occasionally been a place of Commercial Importance. The Degree of its Importance must ever depend on the Prosperity or Distress of Bussora. During the Time, in which the Persians were in Possession of that City Grain was the Port through which, that part of the Produce of India proper for the Bagdad, Damascus, Alleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople Markets, which is annually brought to Bussora found its way to those places. Grain has always had a free communication by the Desert, with Bagdad and Aleppo, and very large and rich carravans during the beforementioned period, frequently passed to and from those Cities. The City of Bussora is situated in Arabia Deserta, on the Western Bank of the Arab River, which is formed by the Junction of the Rivers, the Tygris and the Euphrates, and is distant from the Sea, or the Head of the Persian Gulph, about Seventy Miles. The Commercial Importance of Bussora, in former periods, is generally known. Even so late as the year,* in which the English Factory was removed from Gombroon, and the Management of the Affairs of the Hon'ble Company in the Persian Gulph were confided to their Chief and Council at Bussora, and from that Period, to the year 1773, when the cities of Bagdad and Bussera, and the adjacent Countries, were afflicted with a most violent Plague, which destroyed the principal part of their Inhabitants; the Commerce of Bussora continued to be extensive and important. Many rich Merchants then resided in Bussora, many other rich Merchants o£ Constantinople, Damascus, Aleppo, Orfa, Diarbekir, Mosul, Merdin, and Bagdad, resorted annually to Bussora, with large sums of Money, and rich Investments of different kinds of Goods proper for the Indian Markets, and many Vessels belonging to the English and other- European Nations, and the Moslem Merchants of Surat, annually imported at Bussora, bring ing thither large and valuable Cargoes consisting of European Articles, and of the Produce and Manufactures of India, and carrying from thence, large sums in specie, and the Goods before- mentioned proper for the Indian Markets, the sales and purchases at Bussora, were then made for ready Money and on account of the piratical Vessels, which then infested the Persian Gulph, the principal part of the Freight Trade therpof, was engrossed by the beforementioned406 Vessels belonging to European Nations and to the Moslem Mercliants of Surat. The Plague and many other causes, which will be mentioned in the course of this Report, have since united to injure the commerce of Bassora and have at length reduced it, to a confind and languid state. The City of Bagdad is situated in Mesopotamia on the Eastern Bank of the River Tygris. Its Commerce is greatly dependant on the Commerce of Bussora. In former times, it was infinitely more extensive and consequential, than at the present Period. The public Records of the Hon'ble Coiftpahy at Bussora, contain considerable Informa tion relative to the British Commercial Intercourse with Arabia bordering on the Persian Gulph, from the Period of the Removal of the English Factory from Gombroon* and they will prove that although essential Advantage is known to have accrued to British Individuals from the prosecution of a rather extensive commerce with that country that little Benefit has arisen to the Hon'ble Company from the disposal of their consignments thither, which have principally consisted of woollens, and which have seldom met either a speedy or advantageous Vend. Endeavors will be now used, for the Formation of a tolerably precise statement, of the Present state of the present Commerce of Arabia bordering on the Persian Gulph, and necessary Information ^X'aToixierlng will be given relative to the Degree of security attending a commercial Intercourse with that on the Persian Country. Gnl P h - The situation of Muscat has been already mentioned. That Place is governed by a Person whose Title is Vakeel, and who is appointed by the Imaum of Muscat, who resides at an inland Town called Rustac, distant from thence, about Ninety Miles. The generality of Arab Gov ernments, are respectable ones, and that of Muscat is particularly so. It is severe, but it's severity, is properly tempered by Justice. The Merchants settled there, and the strangers who frequent that Port, are highly favored by the present Vakeel, by name Shaik Calphan, who is always easy of Access, and who uniformly shows, a friendly Attention to their Applica tions, and an active Inclination to render them Justice. They may therefore, on all occasions, justly consider their property to be in the most perfect state of security, and their Persons, exempted from every species of Insult. The commercial Intercourse, carried on between Muscat, the Red Sea and the Persian Oulph, is effected, by means of Dows ; Dingies and square rigged Vessels, belonging to the Arabs ; and the commercial Intercourse, carried on between Muscat and India, is effected in Part by means of the abovementioned Vessels, and in Part, by means of Vessels belonging to different European Nations and to Indian Moslem Merchants. The first mentioned Vessels navigated, by the Arabs of Muscat who are active and enter prizing, though not very Skillful Seamen, perform voyages to the Guadel and Seindiem Coasts, to Surat Bombay, the Coast of Malabar and even latterly to Calcutta. They annually convey to those Places, considerable quantities of Pearl, Rock Salt, Brimstone, Copper, Arsenic, Galls, Saffron, Raw Silk, Dates, Dried Fruits, Assafotida, opium, a variety of other Drugs, many less important Mercantile Articles, and large sums of Money in German Crowns, Venetians, and other Gold and Silver Coins, and they annually import from those Places, at Muscat, considerable quantities of Surat Piece Goods of various kinds, Malabar Cloth Cotton yam, Gujerat Piece Goods, Chintz and Cuttanees Cambay Chauders Broach and Seindy Cotton, Shauls, Bamboos, Chinaware, Sandal Wood, Pepper Ginger, Cardamums. Nutmegs, Cinamon, Cassia Flowers, Musk, Camphire, Turmeric, Indigo, Iron, Lead, Steel, Tin, Tothenaque, Red Lead, Oil, Ghee, Rice, Teak Timber, and many less important Mercantile Articles. The Vessels belonging to Indian Moslem Merchants, which occasionally visit Muscat, convey to and from India, Commercial Articles similar to those imported at, and exported from Muscat by the vessels belonging to that Port. The Vessels belonging to European Nations, which annually import at Muscat, convey to that Place, considerable quantities of Piece Goods, the Manufactures of Bengal and of the Coromandel Coast, Sugar, Spices, Rice, Turmeric, Indigo, Iron, Lend Steel, Tin, Tothenaque, Red Lead, Small Cannon, Balls and some coarse fire Arms. The three last mentioned Articles are principally imported by the French. The Vessels belonging to European Nations, which annuaUy import at Muscat, convey from thence to the English Settlements in India, to Battavia, and to the Mauritius, largeSums in Specie, Gold and Silver coins, Pearl and considerable quantities of Brimstone, Rock Salt, Copper, Arsenic, Balls and many less important mercantile Articles. The Vessels belonging to the Arabs of Muscat, which ara annually despatched to the Ports of Hedeeda, and Mocha in the Red Sea; convey to those places considerable quantities of Dates, the Produce of the vicinity of Bussora, Pearl, varioas kinds of Piece Goods, the Manu factures of Bengal, of the Coasts of Coromandel and Malabar, and o! Surat, Cotton Shauls, Chinaware, Sugar, Sugar Candy, Pepper, Sandal Wood, Ginger, Cardumums, Cloves Nutmegs, Cinnamon, Cassia Flowers, Musk, Cam phire. Opium, Termeric, Indigo, Tobacco, Rosewater and many less important mercantile Articles, and bring in return to Muscat, very valuable cargoes of Yemen Coffee, a Variety of Drugs, and considerable sums of Money in Venetians and German Crowns. The Vessels belonging to the Arabs, which navigate the Persian Gulph, convey to the different Ports thereof the principal Part of the Yemen Coffee, and of the different Indian and European Mercantile Articles which are annually imported as beforementioned at Muscat ; and being in return to that Place, principally, however, from Bussora, considerable quantities of Dates, Copper, Arsenic, Galls, Saffron, Raw Silk, Bagdad and Aleppo Cuttanees, Needles, Hardware, Tobacco, Rosesvater, dried Fruits, Opium, Assafotida, a variety of other Drugs, many less important mercantile Articles and large Sums of Money, in various Gold Coins. The remaining in considerable Part of the Yemen Coffee, and of the other different mercantile Articles, which are annually imported at Muscat, is destined for the consumption of that Place, and of the other Parts of the Province of Oman. It is circulated through that Province by Land conveyance, by the means of Camels, at a moderate Expence, and without any consequential Risk. The Tuties collected by the Government of Muscat, are 6$ per Cent, on all Importations even Provisions not excepted. From the foregoing Informatioa, relative to the Commerce of Muscat, it evidently appears to be of a very important and extensive Nature, and on a consideration of the Advantages arising to Muscat from local situation, it may be fairly concluded that its Commerce must ever flourish. Even in the present Period, whilst Trade languishes and an increasing Scarcity of Specie, prevails in the Turkish and Persian Dominions, the Merchants of Muscats of are engaged in Capitals Commercial Enterprizes, and their sales and Purchases are uniformly made for ready Money. The Wealth derived to them from the valuable Importations annually made at Muscat, of Coffee from the Ports of Hedeeda and Mocha, in the Red Sea, and of Sugar from Batavia are alone sufficient, to render them rich and respectable. The Importations of Coffee, amount to near one half of the quantity annually produced in Yemen, and is sufficient for the full consumption thereof, in the Countries of Persia, Arabia Deserta, Mesopotamia, Coordistan, Armenia, Georgia and Natolia, and in part to satisfy the Demand for that Article of Luxury in Syria, Turkey in Europe, Germany, Poland, Russia and other Northern Kingdoms. The Importations of Sugar are very large, and are sufficient for the Supply, in that indispensably necessary Article of the Countries of Persia, Arabia, Deserta, Mesopotamia, Coordistan, Armi- nia, Georgia and Natolia. The Commerce of the many small Sea Ports, which lie on the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph, between Muscat and the Island of Bahreen, is so very inconsiderable, as not to merit attention. It has already been remarked, that independent of the Pearl Branch, the Commerce of the Island of Bahreen, has till latterly been very inconsiderable. The great share which it possesses of the Pearl Fishery, although it has not latterly proved so productive as in former Times, is, however, in itself a Commercial object of very great Importance. It engages the attention of many rich Arabian Merchants resident at Bahreen, and it gives Employment to many industrious Peopl e of the lower Class belonging to that Place. The principal Fishery is carried on during the Month of May, June, July, August, and September, and in that Season generally yields. Pearls of different Kinds and Sizes to the value of a Sum of Money, equal to Bombay Rupees, five hundred thousand which are divided in Proportions settled by Agreement, between the beforementioned Arabian Merchants, who are the Proprietors of the Vessels employed in the Fishery, the People who navigate them, and the Divers, who are extremely expert, in their art. The principal part of the Pearl, is conveyed from Bahreen, direct toSurat, and from Bahreen to Mocha, via Muscat, Bushire, Scindy, Surat and Calcutta from which four last mentioned Places, it is circulated through Candahar, Multan, India, Tartaiy and China. The remainder supplies the Markets in the Persian Gulph, and in Part finds its way, through the channels of the Levant to those of Europe. Although the commerce of Bahreen independent of the Pearl Branch is even now incon siderable, it has materially increased since the Arabs obtained Possession of the Island and since they furnished themselves with Vessels, proper for the Performance of Voyages from thence to India. It has already been remarked that in consequence thereof, the Arabs have had it in their power to make a principal Part of their annual Importations of Indian and European Mercantile Articles, at Jebarra and CatifEe without their been landed at Muscat, Those Articles in the present Times, are however first conveyed' in a direct manner from Surat to Bahreen, and from thence to Jebarra and CatifHe. The Importations made from Surat at Bahreen, for the consumption of that Island principally consist of small quantities of Surat Blue and other Piece Goods, Guzerat Piece Goods and Chintz, Cambay Chauders, Shauls, Bamboos, Tin, Lead and Iron. The Proprietors of the Vessels in question belonging to Bahreen with a view of rendering their Intercourse with Surat, more beneficial to them, have latterly made consignments to that Place of Sundry Gruff Articles of commerce, and have engaged in small Adventures of Cotton Yarn, Shauls, Surat Blue and other Piece Goods and Guzerat Piece Goods and Chintz proper for the Aleppo, Bagdad and Bussora Markets; Part of which has found its Way through the Channel of Grain, to the two first mentioned Places, and the remainder has been imported at Bussora. The Importations made at Bahreen from Muscat consist of Coffee partly intended for the use of Bahreen and partly intended for the Bussora Market, and of a quantity of Sugar, Pepper, &amp;ca.. Spices of Bengal Soosies, Oil, Ghee,~and Bice, necessary for the consumption of the Islands; and the Importations made at Bahreen, from Bussora consists of a quantity of Dates and Grain, necessary for the consumption of the Island, and of small quantities o£ Copper, Arsenic, Galls, Lamette, Ora Contarino, Venetian false Coral, and Bead of different kinds. Cochineal and Saffron, all which are proper Articles for the Surat Market. The late Enerease in the Trade of Bahreen though small, has proved advantageous to the Island has awakened, in the Merchants thereof a spirit of commercial Enterpize and will probably induce them to endeavour, by the Purchase of larger and better Vessels, and by the Extension of the present Intercourse with India, to engross a considerable part of the Trade of the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph. The Government of Bahreen does not collect Duties of any kind on Mercantile Articles. It has been already remarked, that the Sea Ports of Jebarra and Catiffe enjoy only an inconsiderable share of the Pearl Fishery, of the Persian Gulph ,• and that their commerce is a confined one. The Incentives which actuate the Merchants of those Places to Commercial Enterprizes cannot, however, materially vary. They must ever possess their present share of the Pearl Fishery, and their annual Importation of Surat Blue and other Piece Goods, Cambay Chauders, Guzerat Piece Goods and Chintz, Shauls, Bamboos and many less important mercan tile Articles from Surat, by the way of Bahreen, of Coffee, Sugar, Pepper, etc., Spices, Bengal Soosies, Iron, Lead, Tin, Oil, Ghee, Bice and many less important mercantile Articles from Muscat; and of Dates and of Grain from Bussora ; must ever prove in demand, as well at Jebarra and Catiffe, as in the countries inhabited by the Arabs of the Tribes of Whahab and of Benechalid. Part of the importations in question is retained at Jebarra and Catiffe for the consumption of those places, and of their immediate Vicinities ; and the remainder is conveyed, by Land by means of Camels at a moderate expence, and without any considerable Risk to Draeeah, the usual residence of the Shaik of the Arab?? of the Tribe of Whahab, and to Hassa the usual Residence of the Shaik of the Arabs of the Tribe of Benechalid from which places it is circulated through the Districts, under the Jurisdiction of those Tribe. The Government of Catiffe, is extremely favorable to Merchants, who there enjoy compleat protection, in their Persons and Property, and the Duties collected at that place are very moderate, and are confined to Imports. A Zermaboob is levied on a Bale of Coffee, or a Robin of Pepper, and about I per cent# in kind, on all other Articles, except provisions. The Government of Jebarra, does not collect duties of any Kind on Mercantile Articles. Although Grain, as has been already remarked, is a Sea Port of occasional commercial importance, annual Imports of mercantile articles usually made there, are inconsiderable.409 The Importations made at Grain from Catiffe Jebarra, Bahreen, and Muscat; consist of small quantities of Surat Blue Goods, Bengal coarse white Goods, Bengal Soosiee, Coffee, Sugar, Pepper, &amp;Ca. Spices, Iron and Lead for the consumption of that place and its immediate vioinity, and of more considerable quantities of Bengal Piece Goods Surat Piece Goods, Cotton yarn, Cambay Chauders, Coffee and Pepper for the Bagdad and Aleppo merchants which are in part the property of the merchants of Bahreen, and in part the property of the merchants of Bussora ; and the importations, made at Grain from Bussora, consist of a quantity of Date and Grain, necessary for the consumption of Grain and its immediate vicinity. The duties collected by the Government of Grain on mercantile Importations, a r e similar to those collected by the Government of Catiffe. In order to avoid the payment of the heavy duties, collected by the Government of Bussora on all importations, made at that place, and on all Exportations made from thence to Aleppo, by way of the desert, some of the merchants of Bussora, have latterly caused a part of their merchandize, intended for the Aleppo market, to be conveyed from Muscat to Grain; and although a Carravan has not proceeded from Grain to Aleppo since the year 1781, the beforementioned Merchants of Bassora have found means to convey the Mer chandize in question to Aleppo by the Carravans which have occasionally departed from Bussora for that place, and have thereby defrauded the Government of Bussora of 15 and 17 per cent on the whole of its value. The Conveyance of property from Grain to Bagdad or Aleppo in Carravan by way of the Desert, is not attended with any consequential Danger, the Shaiks of the Carravans being careful to provide themselves, with Eafeaks or Arabs of the different Tribes, who inhabit the Desert Rafeaks, thus employed, consider, the Carravans under their Protection and on meeting' Parties of their own Tribes, have always sufficient influence with them to prevent their committing any acts of violence, provided the Shaiks of the Carravans make the customary presents which are trifling ones, to the Heads of those Parties ; and pay them, the fixed Arab Jewaise or Duties, due to their Tribes. In Arabia, the usual load of a camel is in Weight about seven hundred English Pounds, and the Shaiks of the Carravans will in all Times, by customary agreement, engage to convey from Grain to Aleppo, and to pay the Arab Jewais or Duties thereon, that weight of Piece Goods for a sum of Money equal to Bombay Rs. 130 and that Weight of Gruff Goods, for a sum of money equal to Bombay Rs. 90. The conveyance of Merchandize from Grain to Bagdad, by Carravans u attended, by a Moiety of the expence incurred, in the conveyance of Merchandize from Grain to Aleppo by Carravans. Carravans generally proceed from Grain to Aleppo in about eight Days, and from Grain to Bagdad in about thirty days. It has already been remarked that Grain, Jebarra and Bahreen belong to the Arabs of the tribe of Beneattaba. Those places are united under one Government at the Head of which are Ahmed ibu Califfa, the Shaik of Bahreen, and Abdulla ibu Subbak the Shaik o£ Grain : The Shaiks are both Men of established characters, and they have successfully exerted themselves, to give consequence to their tribe who are now generally respected and feared in the Persian Gulph and are consequently become the most powerful Arabs that navigate it. Their gallivats, and Boats are numerous and large, and they have engrossed the whole of the Freight Trade carried on between Muscat and the Ports on the Arabian shore, of the Persian Gulph, and a principal part of the Freight Trade, carried on between Muscat and Bussora ; the Government of Grain, Jebarra and Bahreen may in point of respectability strictness and Justice, with propriety be compared, to that of Muscat, and the strengers who visit those ports, as well as the merchants resident there, are on all occasions, most compleatly protected, both in their persons and property. Since the capture of the Island of Bahreen by the Arabs of the Tribe of Beneattaba, an Enmity, rather however of an inactive and negative kind, has uniformly subsisted between that tribe and the Persians and has totally destroyed, the commercial intercourse, which previous to that period was advantageously cultivated by both parties. Bussora, by situation is peculiarly adapted to the purposes of commerce ; indeed that city owes its present Existence, to its local Advantages which had they been less conse quential, could not have sustained it under the Pressure, of the heavy and various misfortunes which during the course of the last seventeen years, have united to distress it. Bussora is situated on the Banks of a Noble River, capable of admitting into it Vessels of the Burthen410 of Five liundered Tons^ and peculiarly easy of navigation. It has a free communication with Shuster by the Kaffar and Caroon Rivers ; with Bagdad by the Rivers Tygris and Euphrates ; with Aleppo, by the Desert; and through those channels, with the northern parts of Persia, Coordistan. Armania, Georgia, Not alia, Syria and Europe; and the Sea opens to it, a commercial Intercourse with India. The nature of the Turkish Government is well known, and Expatiation on that subject, js not therefore necessary. It may not however be improper to remark, that although the merchants of Bussora in former troublesome times, and during the late Revolutions, have suffered considerably in their Property, from the Oppressions and Extortions of the Govern- nient ; the present Bacha and the former Bachas of Bagdad have shewn much favor, and have granted Protection, on all necessary occasions, as well to the Merchants of the place, as to the strengers who have visited it. He, and they have wisely considered, that commerce is the true and essential support of Bussora, and that a Sea Port cannot be much frequented or become of great Importance, unless its Government is favorable to mercantile People. The importations usually made at Bussora in British vessels, in Vessels belonging to the Moslem Merchants of Surat and of Muscat, and in Gallivats and Dows belonging to the different Sea Ports of the Persian Gulph, consist of very large quantities varying, however in proportion to the State of Trade, of British Woollens, Bengal Piece Goods of near fifty different kinds, Chintz of different kinds, from the Coromandel Coast, Madras Long Cloth, Port Nuovo Blue Goods, Malabar Cloth, Surat Piece Goods of all kinds. Cotton Yarn, Guzerat Piece Goods, Chinte and Cuttanies, Cambay Chauders, Broach and Seindy Cotton, Shauls, Bamboos, China ware, Sugar, Sugar candy. Pepper, Ginger, Cardamums, Cloves, Nutmegs Cinamon, Cassia Flowers, Musk, Lump Lack, Camphire, Turmeric, Indigo, Iron, Lead, Steel Tin, Tothenaque, Red Lead, Coffee, Tobacco, a variety of Drugs, and many less important merchantile Articles ; all which except the proportions thereof necessary for the consumption of Bussora and its immediate vicinity are transported to Aleppo, and Bagdad by Carravans to Bagdad direct by the River Tygris, and by the River Euphrates via Hilla and to Shus by Boats. The Remarks relative to the conveyance of Property by Carravans from Grain, to Alepo and Bagdad, are entirely applicable, to the conveyance of Property by Carravans from Bussora to Aleppo and Bagdad, and the Expence of such conveyance, is equal from both places. The Bales of Merchandize usually transported from Bussora in Boats to Bagdad and Shuster, are in weight from three to four hundred English Pounds, and the Noquedahs, or Commanders of the Boats, will in all Times, by customary agreement, engage to convey such Bales, and to pay the customs collected thereon, on the different Rivers from Bussora to Bagdad, direct by the River Tygris, for a sum of money equal to Bombay rupees twelve; from Bussora to Hilla by the River Euphrates, for a sum of money equal to Bombay Rupees fifteen ; and from Bussora to Shuster, by the Rivers Haffar and Caroon for a sum of Money, equal to Bombay rupees four. Merchandize is conveyed from Hilla to Bagdad, by land conveyance on Mules and Camels, and the Expense of carriage between those places, of Bales of the before-mentioned Description, amounts to a sum of money equal to Bombay Rupees four on each. In consequence of Disputes occasionally subsisting amongst the Arabs, who inhabit the Banks of the River Euphrates, and of their attempts to dispute the Turkish authority con- eiderable Danger sometimes attends, the conveyance of Property between Bussora and Hilla in Boats. The importations usually made at Bussora, in carravans from Aleppo and Bagdad, and by Boats, and from Bagdad by the River Tygris, and from Hilla by the River Euphrates, consist of Specie, some Gold and Silver and large quantities, varying however, in proportion to the state of Trade, oE Copper, Arsenic, Galls, Catgut, Persian saffron and Raw Silk, Gold and Silver laee, Angora Shauls, Aleppo Flowered Piece Goods, Bagdad and Alleppo, Cuttanies, Shamees, Velvets, Silks, Sattins, English Shalloons, French Broad Cloth, Broad Cloth Caps, Lamette, Ora Contarino, Venetian false Coral, and Beads of different kinds, large and small Looking Glasses, Stained Glass, Brass wire. Coral, Cochineal, Tobacco, Opium, a variety of Drugs and many less important mercantile Articles, all which, except particular Articles, only intended for the Bussora market, and the proportions of the other Articles recessary for the consumption of Bussora, and its immediate vicinity, are transported, by means of the beforementioned411 vessels, which annually import at Bussora, from thence to the different ports of the Persian Gulph, to Muscat and to Indis. The dates, the produce of the vicinity of Bussora, are valued annually on an average, at a sum of Money equal to one Million of Bombay Rupees^ and the principal Part thereof, is exported from Bussora, to different Ports of the Persian Gulf and to India. The duties collected by the Government of Bussora, on all Importations made at that Place from Sea and fr.)m Bagdad and on all Exportations made from thence to sea, and to Aleppo except on those made by Europeans, and on provisions are very heavy ones. Importations of fine goods from sea and from Bagdad, pay 71 per Cent, Duties and imporiations of Gruff Goods from sea and from Bagdad pay 8^ per Cent. Duties. Exportations to Aleppo pay similar duties and exporfcations to sea, of all kinds pay 5| per Cent* Duties. It has already been remarked, that in order to avoid the payment of the exorbitant Duties in question, some of the merchants of Bussora have latterly caused a part of their merchandize intended for the Aleppo Market, to be conveyed from Muscat to Grain. Others in order to accomplish the same fraudulent and have caused part of their Merchandize intended as well for the Markets of Bagdad and Bussora, as for that of Aleppo, to be landed at Bushire, or at the Island of Carrack and to be from thence conveyed to Bussora River ; on the Banks of which they have had camels placed in readiness to convey it to Zebere, an Arab Village situated at about Ten Miles distance from Bussora, from whence the Carravans depart for Aleppo, and people in readiness convey it by night secretly into the city of Bussora. The beforemeutioned conduct of some of the Merchants of Bussora, tends very Materially to increase their profits and to injure the fair Trader, who is consequently obliged to sell his Merchandize both at Bussora, Bagdad and Aleppo, on the reduced terms on which the Merchants in question, are enabled by the success of their schemes to defraud the Bussora Government to vend their property at those places. From the foregoing intelligence, relative to the commerce of Bussora, it is evident that even in its present languid state, it must engage the attention of a great number of merchants and employ very large pecuniary Funds. The Privileges granted by the Ottoman Emperor to the British and other European Nation® at Bussora, are extensive and beneficial ones. The Firmanns of the Ottoman Emperor direct that the property of the Hon'ble Company and of Individuals belonging to the British Nation, shall only be subject to the payment in his territories of the moderate duties of 3 Per Cent, on its Importation at Bussora, and although from some unknown cause the proper advantage has not been taken of the Ottoman Emperor's Inclination, to favor the British Nation and British Property is now liable, notwithstanding the tenor of the beforementioned Fermanns, to the Payment of 3 Per Cent, Duties, as well on its Importation at Bagdad, and Aleppo as at Bussora, and on its Exportation from Bussora; yet, even on these Terms and under the Disadvantage arising from the unavoidable payment to the Honourable Company's Representatives at Bussora, on all their Importations at that place, of 3 Per Cent, Company's Duties and 3 Per Cent. Consulage British subjects, are enabled to trade in the Turkish Dominions, in an infinitely more advantageous manner, than the fair dealing country, resident unprotected Merchants whose Property on its Importation at or its Exportation from Bussora, Bagdad and Aleppo is subject to the Payment of exorbitant Duties. The British subject enjoys at Bussora, many other consequential commercial Advantages, in virtue of the beforementioned Firmanns, and one in particular, of an extraordinary Nature, In the Event of a Country Merchant of Bussora indebted to a British subject, Becoming a Bankrupt the claims of the British subject are by the Firmanns, directed to be satisfied in preference to those of the other creditors, even if the whole of the property of the Bankrupt, does not exceed in Value, the amount of su' h claims. The ancient Friendship subsisting between the Ottoman and British Empires, the privileges granted by the Ottoman Emperor to the British Nation in his territories, by the before- mentioned Firmanns, the services rendered by the Hon'ble Company, and by some of other servants, to the Government of Bagdad and Bussfora, and the General conduct of some of thoso servant, during their Residence at Bussora, have secured to the Hon'ble Company's Factory at that Tjlace, a very considerable degree of Credit and Influence, and have enabled the Gentlemen, who have been honored with the charge thereof, since the period of the removal of the Hon'ble Company's Factory from Gombroon, to give compleat Protection at Bussora, to all British412 Subjects and Dependents, both in their Persons and Property even during the Misfortunes, War and Revolutions, which have latterly united, to injure that once opulent and flourishing city. Even possessed of the beforementioned advantages, it has not however been in the power of the Hon'ble Company's servants stationed at Bussora, to render their commercial Intercourse, with Arabia bordering on the Persian Gulf, beneficial to their Employers. The Hon'ble Company's late consignments to Bussora have consisted entirely of Broad Cloth a nd Long Ells, which have neither meet speedy or profitable sales, in consequence of the increase in their Invoice Prices, of variations, in the rates of Exchange, of the Scarcity of Specie, of the importations at Bagdad and Bussora of French Woollens of different kinds, and of the serious obstructions, caused to the commerce of Bussora by the Revolutions which have lately happened in the Government of that city and by the War in which the Ottomans are at present engaged. The consignments of Indian Price Goods, made to Bussora, by British and other Traders since the year 1786 have in general proved unprofitable Adventures. It has already been remarked, that the commerce of Bagdad, is greatly dependent on the commerce of Bussora, and the Information which has been already given relative to the commercial Intercourse between the two cities is ample. The situation of Bagdad, is extremely favourable to the purposes of commerce, and the communication, which is generally » open between that City, and the northern Parts of Persia ; Coordistan, Armenia, Georgia, a Natolia, Turkey in Europe, and Syria, affords a variety of branches of commerce, to the choice of an enterprizing Merchant. Carravans frequently pass, not however without being occasionally exposed to considerable danger, between Bagdad and Isphahan, via Hamada and Erzerum, between Bagdad and many of the Towns in Coordistan, Armenia and Georgia between Bagdad, and the cities of Merdin, Mosul Diarbekir, Arfa and Constantinople, and between Bagdad and the cities of Aleppo, and Damascus, and convey to Bagdad considerable sums of money and to and from that place, the several mercantile Articles, which have been already particularized under the denominations of exportations from, and importations at Bussora, and sundry other articles of commerce, produced at some and proper for the consumption as well of others of those places, as of the Europe Markets. The Persian Merchants and Pilgrims who annually visit Bagdad, convey to it many valuable commercial Articles, the Manufactures and Produce of Persia considerable sums of Money. The Government of Bagdad is favorable to commerce, although the duties collected on importations made there are exorbitant ones. oh^nT of^thfcom- ^ evident from the in£orm ation that has been already given in the course of meree of Bnasora. re po r t&gt; on the subject of the commerce of Arabia bordering on the Persian Gulf, that although a favourable change has latterly taken place, in the commercial Interests of Muscat, Beahreen, Jebarra, and Grain, the commercial Importance of Bussora has since the year 1773 most materially decreased. An Attempt will be here made to give, an Idea of the disadvan tageous Difference which has taken place in the commerce of Bussora, since the Period of the removal of the Hon'ble Company's factory from Gombroon, to explain the causes of its Decline, and to shew, that the merchants of Bussora, have still, however, some remaining, Incentives to commercial Pursuits. From the Period of the removal of the English Factory from Gombroon to the year 1773 in which a violent Plague ravaged Bagdad and Bussora, and the Countries adjacent thereto, the commerce of Bussora was very considerable; and the annual Importations made at Bussora in Indian Piece Goods alone, amounted on an average to the Number of three thousand or three thousand five hundred Bales ; which Bales were chiefly the property of the Merchants settled in Bengal at Masulipatnam, Madras and Surat, and were conveyed from thence to Bussora, in Ten or Twelve Vessels, belonging to British subjects, and to the Moslem Merchants o Suiat, which Vessels conveyed to India large sums of Money and many valuable mercantile Articles. During the beforementioned Period the Hon'ble Company made considerable Importations at Bussora, in Broad Cloth and Long Ells, and trifling Importations at that place, in Imbossed Cloth, Carpets, Tin, Lead, Iron, Steel, &amp;ca., Articles. From the cessation of the Plague, and the return of the English Factory to Bussora to the year 1775, the period in which a very large Persian Army, under the Command of Sadac Khan, Brother to Carim Khan, then Vakeel of Persia, undertook the siege of Bussora, the British commercial Intercourse, with that place, and its general commerce materially declined which unfavorable circumstances, may with propriety be principally attributed to the413 Devastations of the Plague. It has been computed that Bussora and Bagdad, and the Countries adjacent thereto, suffered a loss of near one third part of their Inhabitants from the ravages of that terrible calamity. From the Periods of the removal of the English Factory from Bussora in the year 1775, and the Capture of Bussora by the Persians in the year 1776, to those of the Death of Karim Khan, of the consequent relinquishment of Bussora, by the Persians and of the Re-establish ment there of the Turkish Government in the year 1779, few British Vessels visited the Port of Bussora and although on the return of the English Factory to Bussora in the year 1776 and during the latter part of the period, in which the Persians held Possession of Bussora considerable sales of Woollens were effected by the Hon'ble Company^ servants, and many commercial Articles, the Property of Individuals met advantageous sales; yet the Commerce of Bussora then received the most serious Injury, from the violent Injustice and Extortions of the Persians from the consequent Flight of many rich and enterprizing Merchants, and of a great part of the remaining Inhabitants of Bussora and from the large Quantity of Specie conveyed by the Persians to their own Country. In the years 1779 and 1780, Bussora had rather the Appearance of a depopulated and ruinous City, than of a rich crowded busy and prosperous Sea Port, to which Hon'ble title, that place had long with great Propriety boasted an undisputed Right. From the year 1780 to the Period, of the commencement, of the War, in which the Ottomans are engaged, and of the seizure of Bussora by the Montific Arabs in the year 1787 Bussora began to revive. The Number of its Inhabitants gradually increased. Some of the Merchants, who had abandoned, Bussora, whilst under the Persian Government; returned to it; many of the Resident Merchants of Bussora, encouraged by the prevailing tranquility, and the prospect of gain, took the necessary measure, for the Importation at Bussora, of considerable quantities of India Piece Goods ; British Vessels, and Vessels belonging to Indian Merchants, a^ain frequented the Port of Bussora ; the Merchants of Constantinopl. Damascus, Aleppo, Arfa, Diarbekir, Mosul, Merdin and Bagdad, again resorted to Bussora; sales of Woollens were there effected by the servants of the Hon'ble Company, with some Advantage, Indian Commodities of all kinds met a speedy, and profitable vend; and Commerce reared her drooping Head. The War in which the Ottomans are engaged, and the late revolutions in the Government of Bussosa, have however since, reduced the commerce of Bussora. to so very languid a state that the Importations at Bussora in the year 1789 of Indian Piece Goods did not exceed the Number of 800 Bales, the whole Treasure Freight of the Merchant Vessels on their return to India did not in that year exceed, the value of Bombay Rupees fifty thousand, and it was not possible to dispose of a small and choice assortment of Woollens, the Property of the Hon'ble Company, but at a very long credit. The Plague, the Invasion of the Persians/the War in which the Ottomans are at present engaged, and the late Revolutions in the Government of Bussora, have been already mentioned as principal causes of the Decline of the commerce of Bussora, it will be now necessary to describe other circumstances, which have had the same Tendency. In the Turkish Dominions a scarcity of specie has long prevailed. It has gradually increased and is daily increasing. The pecuniary Difficulties under which the Turkish Empire, in General, and the city of Bussora, in particular, consequently labour, are of the most serious and distressing nature. Previous to the Plague, the Major part of the Specie Eemittances made from Bussora to India, was composed of Turkish Gold coins. Since the capture of Bussora by the Persian few Turkish coins, proper for Remittance to India, have been procureable there. The specie remittances to India have therefore latterly chiefly consisted of Venetian chequins from Bussora, and the Ports on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulph, and of Venetian chequins, Indian and Persian Gold and Silver Coins from Muscat. A considerable loss, has arisen on all the Remittances, latterly made from Bussora to India. Neither Specie Gold, Silver, Pearl, Pearl Respondentia, Coral, Venice Ware, Copper nor any other mercantile Articles, have for some years, yielded in the Indian Markets to their Proprietors, the amount of their value in Bussora, and the charges of their conveyance from thence. Encouraged by the Difficulties, under which commerce has laboured, and by the consequent Inability of the commonality to purchase Piece Goods for cloathing the produce of India, a414 certain class of Manufacturers^ residing chiefly in the Bagdad, Mosul, Diarbekir, Aleppo and Damascus, and in the vicinities of those places have exerted themselves to produce on reason able Terms, various kinds of coarse Goods, sufficiently similar in Quality and Appearance, ^ to Goods formerly brought from India to the Bussora Market, to induce many of the Inhabit ants of the beforementioned places and of their vicinities to use them. The Goods in question have gradually become in repute they are now in common Wear, and only a small quantity of the Indian Goods, of which they are Imitations, are consequently now vendible. People of high Rank and Fortune in the Turkish Empire, can alone afford to use the costly Goods, annually imported from India at Bussora, and the Expence in which the generality of them are involved by the War in which the Ottomans are engaged, for the support of their Military Employments, leaves them little to devote, to the purposes of Luxury. Large Importations have latterly been made into the Turkish Empire of India Muslins, of different qualities, through the channel of sea conveyance, from Bengal to Europe ; as well on the Hon'ble Company^ Ships, as in those of Foreign Nations. The Merchants of England, free of the Levant Company, and the Merchants of Marseilles, Leghorn, and Trieste, have latterly made considerable consignments of India Muslins, to Smyrna and Constantinople, and they can often at those Markets, afford to undersell, the proprietors, of Muslins, conveyed thereto, through the channel of Bussora. The injurious operations of the beforementioned, and of some less consequential causes of the Decline of the Commerce of Bussora, are heavily felt, as well by the Resident Merchants, of Bussora, as by the strangers who visit that Port. The Extortions, which the Merchants of Bussora, suffered during the late revolutions were oppressive and discouraging circumstances and the great Difficulty which now exists, of procuring a vend for Indian Piece Goods, either at Bussora, Bagdad, Damascus, Aleppo, Smyrna or Constantinople, even at a long credit, and at a consequent Risk, deters them from engaging in capital Adventure in those Articles. The Merchants of Bussora, have still however some Incentives to Commercial Pursuits. The Place, as has been already remarket, is by situation peculiarly adanted to the Purposes of commerce, and it may reasonably be hoped, that, if a Peace is early concluded between the Ottoman Emperor and his European Enemies, and if Bussora, and the adjacent Country enjoy a continuance of the present Tranquility commerce will considerably revive. A well informed Merchant, may then, with confidence, again venture to speculate, in Indian Piece Goods, and an active and industrious one, may even now, with a certainty of benefitting himself en gage, in a consfderable Trade, which is now and has ever been notwithstanding all difficul ties and obstructions in Bussora, in the Gruff Articles of Coffee, Sugar, Pepper, &amp;ca., &amp;ca., necessaries. In favorable Times the Profits acruing to the Merchant of Bussora, are extremely well worthy of his Attention, and a short Period of success, well often fully counterbalance the disadvantages arising to him, from a temporary suspension of Trade, and compensate to him, past Loss of Time, and Trouble, and past Risk and Difficulty. Measures which It has been thought necessary to precede the sentiments, which will be hereafter expressed to^^ncrease ^the on t ^ e ^ject of the of Increase of the British Commercial Intercourse with Arabia bordering B 'th S A ^ te ^ co ^ rse on ^ ie ^ ers i an G ulpt, by an Assurance that they are submitted to the consideration of the ing on the Persian British Government in India, in the most respectful Manner. Qulpk The Hon^ble Company have latterly confined their consignments to Bussora to Broad Cloth, and Long Ells and the Sales thereof, as the Public Records will prove, have never been encouraging. The Exportation of the Woollens Manufactures, of Great Britain, has however been always considered as a great object, and it is therefore to be supposed, that the Hon'ble Company, notwithstanding the Disadvantages, under which that Branch of their commerce labours, will continue to prosecute it, and endeavor to render it more beneficial. In order to do so, it will be absolutely necessary, that in the purchase, in Great Britain, of Woollens for the Bussora Market, the most particular attention be paid to their qualities and colors. In former Times, when less quantities of French Woollens, found their way through the channels of the Lavant to the Markets of Bagdad and Bussora, and the consignments of W oollens, made by the Hon'ble Company to Bussora, supplied that city, the city of Bagdad and the country of Coordistan, and part of them found their way even to Alleppo and Damascus, it was possible not however without Difficulty to dispose of Woollens at Bussora, of all kinds and of inferior colors. In the present Times however, in which a distressing scarcity of specie prevails in the Turkish Dominions, when a Poor Man, can415 on easy Terms furnish himself, with a Woollen Garment of inferior quality of French Manu facture and when a richman, is only tempted to incur the Expence, attending the Purchase of a garment of English Broad Cloth by its superior Fineness and by its preferable color, choice Assortments of Woollens, can only have a chance, of meeting a speedy sale, or of yielding a decent Profit. In short the Woollens destined for the Bussora Market ought to be provided in exact conformity to the Indents, framed by the servants of the Hon'ble Company stationed, at that Place, and ought uniformly to arrive there, previous to the Month of October in every year, when the approaching Winter, renders the Provision of Warm Clothing absolutely necessary. Late observation, has established an opinion, that the Hon'ble Company might reap Advantage, from the annual consignment to Bussora of small quantities of Iron, Lead and steel, although the private Trader, cannot adventure in those commercial Articles, with a Prospect of gain. They will not bear the heavy charge of Freight from India. The Hon'ble Company can however convey them, from the Presidency of Bombay to Bussora, free of Ex pence, on the Vessels belonging to them which annually pass between those Places, and therefore^ a Trial might, with Propriety be made. In the year 1785 the British Government in Bengal, entertained an Idea of making consignments to the Persian Gulph, on the Public Account, of Bengal Goods; and orders were consequently issued, to the servants of the Hon'ble Company, then stationed at Bussora, to furnish a List of Goods' proper for the Bussora Market, and the necessary Information on the subject of the Trade in Piece Goods, then carried on between Calcutta and Bussora; which orders were obeyed. It has already been remarked, in this report, that it may reasonably be hoped, that if a Peace is early concluded between the Ottoman Emperor and his European Enemies, and if Bussora and the adjacent country enjoy a continuance of the present Tranquility, drooping commerce may considerably revive and the well,' informed Merchant, may again with confidence speculate in Indian Price Goods. It is to be supposed, that the servants of the Honble Company, employed at the Aurungs in Bengal, may have it in their Power, to prepare Investments there, of the different kinds of Piece Goods proper for the Bussora Market on the Public Account on Terms, considerably more favorable than those, on which, the private Trader, can make Purchases of similar Manufac tures. Those servants, impowered by Public Authority, may certainly have the Preferences in the choice of the Goods on sale at the Aurungs, or, if it be thought necessary to order Goods to be Manufactured, expressely for the Bussora Market, they may select for that Purpose, the most experienced, and able Workmen. These, and a variety of other Advantages, under which the Hon ; ble Company, can engage in the Trade carried on between Calcutta and Bussora, in Piece Goods are sufficiently weight to justify a Trial. If the British Government in Bengal, determine to engage on the public account, in the Trade, carried on between Calcutta and Bussora in Piece Goods, to the full Extent of the List transmitted from Bussora in the year 1786, a Vessel of about four hundred Tons Burthen, will be requisite to convey the Goods annually to Bussora. It may not however be improper to hint, that if the British Government in Bengal, decline to employ a Vessel on the public account, or, as is adviseable, give the preference to a more confined Trial, and in consequence thereof issue orders for the Provision of only one-half, or even one-third of the quantity of Goods specified in the List above-mentioned, they will have an opportunity of annually conveying such goods to Bussora, on the usual Terms of Freight on a Vessel, called the Laurel, which is constantly employed, in the Freight Trade carried on between Calcutta and Bussora, and which on examination, will be found to be in every respect unexceptionable. Considerable profit generally attends the Adventures to Bussora in Cotton and Pepper ; but it is imagined, that the private Trader, can Purchase those commercial Articles in India on Terms equally, if not more favourable, than those on which the Hon'ble Company could alone, provide them. A trial therein is not worthy the public Attention. Observations similar to those made, above relative to Cotton and Pepper, are applicable to the Piece Goods usually exported from Surat to Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf. The Establishment of an English Factory, at the Port of Muscat, whether, viewed in a political or a Commercial Light, has over been considered by the Framers of the present report, as a measure of great propriety. It is reasonable to suppose, that the British Nation mighty reap considerable advantage from such an establishment. Muscat, as has been aire ad416 remarked, is a place, that must from situation, in all times flourish. Its commerce must be extensive. An English Resident there., after being allowed a sufficient Time of Residence, to acquire local knowledge, might probably have it in his power to furnish the British Government in India with a variety of useful commercial Hints, and to discover Modes of encreasing the British Intercouse with Arabia bordering on the Persian Gulph. It may not be improper here to remark, that the French have latterly made attempts for the Establishment of a Factory at Muscat; and that the Person actually, in charge of the French Factory at Bussora, is said to be destined to that place. The French, from causes unknown, have hitherto failed in their views. The Partiality and Friendship, which the Arabs of Muscat have long manifested towards the British Nation however justify the Idea, that the Imaum of Muscat, would permit the British Flag, to fly at that Place, and cause it to be treated with becoming respect. The Hon'ble Co npany uniformly prohibited their servants from making sales of their property on credit, and the propriety of the Prohibition has been on all occasions manifested, and peculiarly so, in those places, in which a scarcity of specie has not prevailed. A mature consideration of the pecuniary Distresses, under which the Turkish Dominions now labour and a nice observation of the Effects which they have had, on Commercial Intercourses, have fixed an opinion, that considerable Advantages, accrue to the Venders of Goods in that Country, from their making sales on credit. It is therefore submitted to the consideration and Judgement of the British Government in India, whether a Latitude might not be given with propriety, to the servants of the Hon'ble Company stationed at Bussora to makes sales, of the Property of the Hon'ble Company entrusted to their care, in some particular cases, on credit, to People of Mercantile reputation and responsibility. It is to be supposed that the Gentlemen, who may have the Honor to be empowered by Government, to make such sales will feel themselves highly flattered by the confidence reposed in their Judgements, and Integrity and be thereby stimulated, to the most cautious, and wary conduct. Little Risk can be incurred by making sales on credit at Bussora, to People of mercantile reputation and responsibility. The commercial Privileges enjoyed by the Hon'ble Company at that Place, are, as has been already remarked, very extensive ones, and in cases of Emergency and Importance, in which the Mussaleem of Bussora, or even the Baeha of Bagdad might shew Disinclination, to support those privileges, the Influence of the British Embassador at the subline Porte would never fail to obtain Justice. CoMMEKCB OP the R ed S eA. The Remoteness of Bussora from the Red Sea, and the Want of communication therewith, renders it extremely difficult for Persons stationed at Bussora, to collect any Information on the subject of the commerce, carried on in that quarter of the World, and will, it is feared, prevent them, from furnishing the British Government in India, with a knowledge thereof sufficiently competent, to enable them to form a Judgement of the propriety, of using efforts, to encrease the commercial Intercourse which has long subsisted between the Ports of India and those of Mocha, and Judda and which has occasionally been extended to Suez. The Result of Enquiry and reflexion will here however be submitted to the consideration of the British Government in India, It will not be necessary to attempt to give a particular account of the Ports of Mocha* Hedeeda, Judda and Suez or to describe the Nature of the Governments on the Eastern Coasts of the Red Sea. It will be proper however to give the following Hints in respect to them. The Government of Egypt is in itself extremely corrupt, it is not sufficiently vigorous to keep the Arabs under it, who are a restless and unprincipled People in Awe, and the rapacity cruelty and Injustice of the Beys, who compose the Members of it, and the Avidity of the Governor of Suez, must ever subject the Merchants who may frequent that Port with a view of conveying their property from thence to Cairo, to infinite Inconvenience, Difficulty and Risk. Indeed the Misfortunes which were suffered by the Adventurers to Suez in the year 1779 were of a Nature sufficient serious, to annihelate the Trade carried on for a few years previous to that period, between Suez and the Ports of Calcutta, Bombay and Surat. A Trade which however beneficial to some Individuals, has been supposed to be inimical to the Interests of the Hon'ble Company.417 The Port of Judda, is under the Jurisdiction of tbe ScherifE of Mecca whose Government is considered as a very equitable and respectable one. Extortions have however been committed by the Governors of Judda on the Merchants who have formerly frequented that Port, and British subjects have at Judda occasionally suffered considerable Losses, in conse quence of the Government having declined to support, by its authority, their just Demands on the Resident Traders who having made large purchases on credit, have, on the expiration thereof, in tbe most unprincipled manner; refused to fulfill their engagements and to make good their stipulated payments. The Port charges of Judda are exorbitant, and Vessels have there frequently suffered nnbecoming Indignities. The Ports of Hedeeda, and Mocha are under tbe Jurisdiction of the Imaum of Sena, whose Government has justly acquired, the reputation of a wise and equitable one. The Port of Hedeeda has never been frequented by British vessels. The Port of Mocha has been frequented by British vessels for many years. The conduct of the Governor of Mocha towards Foreign Merchants has been occasionally incorrect, but in general strangers have there received friendly treatment, and their property has been exposed to Risk. The Port charges at Mocha, are exorbitant. The Navigation of the Red Sea is attended with some consequential difficulties and disadvantages. Vessels can only pass the straights of Babil Mandil on their way to and from Mocha towards Judda, and Suez, at certain seasons of the year, and although the Red Sea, is not infested, by piratical vessels, of any considerable Force, yet the voyage from Mocha to Judda and particularly to Seuz is rendered extremely intricate and dangerous, by the numerous Island, shoals and sunken Rocks, which are interspersed in the Red Sea, and by the variable currents which prevail therein. The commercial Intercourse carried on between the Ports of Calcutta, and Surat and those of Mocha and Judda, has been for some time on the decline. Formerly many English vessels annually frequented the Port of Judda, and very large Importations were made there, in of Bengal Muslins and fine Piece Goods of various kinds, and in rich Guzerat, and Surat Piece Goods and Cotton Yarn, all which were commercial Articles then sailed to the markets of Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople. The principal Part of the abovementioned Goads, were conveyed from Judda to Mecca, and during the stay there of the Pilgrims, who annually resorted to that place, were exposed to sale. Many of those Pilgrims were not induced to undertake, long and hazardous journeys to the Tomb of Mahomed, from mere Motives of religious Duty, some of them rich Merchants of Constantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo and other cities, furnished themselves, with v iluable Invest ments of Goods proper, for the consumption of Arabia, and for the Indian Markets and with large sums of money in Venetians and Germans Crowns, and repairing to Damascus, there joined the great Carrawan, which annually proceeds to Mecca, with commercial views. They said their Prayers and made sales and purchases acquiring at once, the honorable Title of Haujee and additional wealth. The state of the Markets in India and Turkey no longer hold out prospects of Advantage to Adventurers of the above description. The importations at Judda have gradually diminished, and the Branch of commerce in question has materially declined. The Pilgrims of the present times, make only comparatively petty sales and purchases at Mecca, and are principally induced to engage in trifling Adventures, by the hope, of thereby defraying a part of the whole of the expence of their pilgrimages. That Port of the Importations in question which remained at Judda, was reserved for the supply of Eygpt and the Barbary Coast, and it was conveyed to Suez, in the Fleet of large ships belonging to that Port, which annually visit Judda, and take in valuable cargoes of Coffee, the produce of Yemen. English vessels have now ceased to frequent the Port of Judda and the Importations made there, by the Surat Freight ship, and by the Boats belonging to the Arabs of Hedeeda and Mocha, of Indian Mercantile Articles, in the present times are principally confined to coarse white Bengal Goods, Bengal Soosies, Bengal Cuttanees, Porto Novo Blue Goods, Carnbay Chauders, Surat Coarse Goods, Guzeral Chintz, Cotton, Chinaware, Sugar, Sugar- candy, Pepper, Sandal Wood, Ginger, Cardamums, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinamon, Musk Camphire, Turmeric, Indigo, Tobacco, and rose water, which are all proper for the consumption of Arabia, and of cotton yarn Shauls and Guzerat and Surat Piece Goods, which are properfor the markets of Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople and which still find their way to those places by means of the Damascus, Carrawan, and the Suez Fleet. The principal part of the few European Mercantile Articles, which are in Demand at Judda, and Mecca, are conveyed to Mecca, in the Damascus Carrawan, and to Judda, in the Suez Fleet. The Moslem and other Merchants who embark on the Suez Fleet, furnish themselves at Cairo and Alexacdiia from the French and Italian Merchants settled in those Cities with BroadCloth and other Woollens, Iron, Steel, Lead and a variety of petty aiticles, which they either sell at Jedda, or exchange therefor Coffee. Part of the beforementioned Articles are consumed in Judda ; in Mecca, and in the country adjacent thereto, and the Remainder is purchased at Jedda, or there received in Exchange for Coffee, by the Merchants of Hedeeda and Mocha, when they repair to Jedda in Boats, laden with valuable cargoes of Yemen Coffee; to meet the Suez Fleet, and is circulated through theTerritorries of the Imaum of Sena. A few European mercantile Articles, have been latterly imported at Mocha by the French. The Suez Fleet also conveys to Judda large sums of Money in Venetians and German Crowns coral fals coral, and other Venetian Beads of different kinds, Lamette cochineal, and many other less important mercantile Articles proper for the Indian markets. The Importations of Indian mercantile Articles are in the present times, made at Mocha, by English Vessels from Bengal, by the Surat Freight ship, by Vessels belonging to the Malabar Coast, &amp; by Boats belonging to the Arabs (i Muscat and principally consist of coarse white Bengal Goods of different kinds, Bengal Soosies, Bengal Cuttanees Porto Nuovo Blue Goods, Guzerat Chintz, Cotton, Shauls, Pepper, Sugar, Sugarcandy, Chinaware, Spices of various Kinds, Musk, Camphire Opium, Turmeric, Indigo, Tobacco | and many less impor tant ones, all which are proper for the consumption of Arabia. The inhabitants of the Coasts of the Red Sea, are poorly provided with Boats of sufficient strength and Magnitude to undertake voyages from thence to India. The Arabs of Muscat, who, as has been already remarked, are of an Active and enter- prizing Disposition, and are well furnished with Good Vessels of various kinds, are particularly anxious to prosecute the Coffee Trade, from which they derive infinite advantage, and they are therefore careful in their voyages to India, to supply themselves with Goods suited to the Markets of Mocha, Hedeeda and Judda, which Goods constitute a principal part of the cargoes of the Boats, which are annually despatched from Muscat to the Red Sea. The Arabs of Muscat, having latterly found it more easy and beneficial to made their sales and purchases at Hedeeda, than at Mocha the principal part of the Boats beforemen tioned tow frequent the former Port. Hedeeda has within these few years considerable increased in Importance. The Ports on the Western shore of the Red Sea, have been little frequented by British Vessels and it is therefore to be supposed, that they hold forth little prospect of advantage to the mercantile adventurer. The inhabitants of that Region are little acquainted with the articles of Luxury with which India abounds, and being in a rude and unpolished state they have few wants, beyond those, which the produce, of their own sterile country, can satisfy. A few coarse Surat and Porto Nuovo Goods, are however annually sold to the people, belonging to that Part of the Western shore of the Red Sea, which lies immediately opposite to Mocha, who pay occasional visits to that place, carrying thither supplies of Abyssinian sheep, and as a communication is kept up, by Boats between Judda and Cossair, it is to be supposed that a quantity of similar Goods find their way to that place and its vicinity. The beforementioned English Vessels from Bengal, Surat Frieght ship, &amp; vessel belonging to the Malabar Coast, convey from Mocha to India, a sufficient, quantity of Yemen Coffee, for the supply of that country large sums of Money in Venetians and German Crowns, and the coral false coral and other Venetian Beads of different Kinds, Lamette, Cochineals &amp; less important Mercantile Articles, proper for the Indian Markets, which 'ind their way to Judda by means of the Damascus Carrawan and Suez Fleet. The French Vessels which visit Mocha, convey from thence to the Mauritius consider able quantity of Coffee. The Island of Socotra, has not latterly been frequented by English vessels. It is however supposed, that a small quantity of coarse Indian Piece Goods might be annually bartered there, with advantage, for Socatrine Aloes.-Wy 419 Some years ago ; the Hon'ble Company gave Directions to the Government of Bombay, to establish an English Factory at Mocha ; in consequence of which Directions, Mr. G-eorge Horsely, a Gentleman of uncommon Ability, was sent ts that place, with the appointment of Resident. The factory was however early withdrawn and it is therefore to be concluded that its establishment did not then materially tend to the increase of the British Commercial Interests in that quarter of the world. As however, it is the wish of the British Government in India to increase, as much as possible the commerce of the Hon'ble Company as the custom of annually sending one of the Hon'ble Company's Europe ships, to take in, at Mocha a cargo of Coffee has been lately resumed, and as the French, have thought it, the interest of their nation aijain to nominate a Resident to Mocha, it is conceived that the reestablishment of an English Factory at that place, under the Direction of an intelligent Gentlemen well versed in mercantile Affairs, might prove, a measure, o£ considerable utility. C ommerce of P ersia The detail of the commerce of Persia, for the reasons already mentioned in the foregoing part of this, report will be divided under the follewing heads :— Past state of the commerce of Persia, Present state thereof. The measures which appear most probable to increase the present British commercial intercourse, with that kingdom and the countries bordering upon it. In all enquiries into the transactions of past times, it will be found necessary to fix Past atate of the upon some period, at which those enquiries shall commerce and since the Records an ^ comm0roe ^ P0rsia * Accounts of the Factories heretofore established by the Hon'ble Company at Gombroon, lepahaun and the interior parts of the Kingdom of Persia during the Reign of the Princes of the House of Seffi, are many of them lost, an investigation of the early times of the British commercial Intercourse, with Persia, were it even an object worthy of attention, must be given up for want of sufficient and authentic materials. It is not to be supposed that the turbulent and sanguinary Reign of Nadir Shah, who usurped the Throne of Persia, could by any means prove propitious either to the foreign or domestic commerce of the state, for notwithstanding the Shah directed, that the Loss which Mr. Jones Hanway would otherwise have sustained by the seizure of his woollens by the Rebels at Astrabad in the year 1744- should be made good to that Gentleman, yet such parts of the Hon'ble Company's Records of this settlement as contain any information in respect to Persia, are replete with instances of the oppression which the Shah practised upon the Factories of Gombroon and Ispaliaun, and of the insults which he repeatedly and unprovekedly offered to the Gentlemen to whose care they were entrusted. From the Assassination of Nadir Shah to the etablish- ment of Kerim Khan the Empire was plunged into deeper scenes of confusion and distress than it had ever experienced before, so that the Assumption by Kerim Khan of the Title of Vakeel or Regent appears the Era, at which it will be most proper, to commence th e account ofithe past state of the commerce of Persia ; as from that period, to the death of the Vakeel, the Kingdom enjoyed an Interval of Repose. It is to be regreted, that the Hon'ble Company's Records at Bussora afford no informa tion of the annual Amount, of the Imports and Exports made on account of the Company at Gombroon during the time of that Port being in its most flourishing state, and that they contain only those of a few months, preceding the arrival of the orders from Europe to withdraw the Factory from thence ; from which indeed it is evident, that the British Commerce in Persia had declined so much, that setting aside extortions which the Factory at Gombroon was constantly experiencing, from the Persian Governors, neither prudence nor interest could justify or induce the Hon'ble Company, to support, so expensive an establishment. Kerim Khan though deficient in the accomplishments of Literature and Politeness, possessed a manly and vigorous understanding, alike capable of perceiving the more minute circumstances, which might tend to the advantage of Persia, and of embracing and compre hending the more complicated, and extensive schemes, for its prosperity after declining the invidious Title of Shah, he at length, found himself in some measure under the necessity, from the general Voice of the people, of accepting the inferior one of Vakeel; to which, however, he took care to annex every careful prerogative of Royalty. The Vakeel earJjrperceived that in the desolate state, to which Persia had been reduced, by the long Period of a Civil War and by the expensive campaigns of Nadir Shah, the necessary Expences of the Government, would far exceed the Revenues collected ; and that the only effectual means of encreasing the receipts of the Royal Treasury, were to encourage and invite Merchants from all parts to settle in his Dominions, to endeavor to receive every Branch of Manufacture; and to invariably protect the Peasantry, who had so long struggled under Misery and oppression. Possessed of sentiments like these, it could not long escape the Penetration of the Vakeel, how highly injurious the withdrawing the different European Factories formerly established in Persia had proved to the Commercial Interests thereof and as the Country round Gombroon, had not yet compleatly submitted to his authority, he urged Shaik Sadoon the Governor of Bushire, to make repeated applications to the Chief at Bussora, for the Establishment of an English Factory at the Port. The applications of the Shaik met with success and the then Government at Bombay, directed Mr. Price, a Member of their own Board, who was then proceeding to Bussora with the Appointment of Chief of the Factory at that place, to touch at Bushire and to treat with Shaik Sadoon on the subject. Mr. Price found no difficulty in exe cuting the object of his Instructions and Mr. Jervis a Servant of the Hon-'ble Company was left in charge of their Affairs, at that place, with the Appoint ment of Resident. Notwithstanding the Residency at Bushire was so regulated, by the orders of the Hon'ble the President and Council at Bombay as to be subordinate to the Chiefship o£ Bussora, yet the Information which is to be obtained from the Records of the Chiefsbip, in regard to the Transactions of the subordinate, is scanty and incomplete. From what little it has been possible to glean from them, it appears the Mr. Jervis, occasionally made large sales of Woollens, Velvets &amp;ca. on the Hon'ble Company's account, that the commerce carried on by private Merchants residing there daily increased, and that Bushire soon after the establishment of the English Residency became a Port of Importance. The violence offered by the Turkish Governor of Bussora to the Baron Kniphansen, the Chief of the Dutch Factory at tbat place, gave birth, to the Establishment of a Dutch Fort and Factory on the Island of Carrack. Kerim Khan was too anxious to see the European Factories again established in Persia, to refuse the request of the Governor General of Batavia, for an unconditional Grant of the little Island of Carrack; and the Baron, Kniphansen, to whose care the infant settlement was entrusted, soon erected thereon a Fort of no mean strength, Lodgings for the different Servants of the Dutch Company, Warehouses for their Goods, and Barracks for the Troops stationed there for the defence of the Island. The Dutch Imports-at Carrack consisted mostly of the same commodities which they had formerly imported at Bussora, but their returns were different, being made partly in Pearl, Mules, the Wines of Schyras and the Drugs produced in different parts of Persia. To this Establishment of the Dutch Factory at Carrack, the little Port of Bundereeg situated on the Persian shore nearly opposite to the Island of Carrack, became endebted for many Advantages. The Ports of Bushire and Bundereeg though situated at much the same distance, by Water from the Island of Carrack, differed very materially in respect to their situation to Scherauze, the Market for which the greatest parts of the Dutch Imports were designed. A Cofla departing from the former of these Ports, for Scherauze, generally per formed its Journey in twelve to fourteen days, whilst those which proceeded from the latter, required no more than Seven to Eight days on the Road. This difference in the Time of Performing, necessarily created a difference in the Expence of the Journey, and the Dutch for the conveyance of the Goods sent to Scherauze, either on the Account of the Dutch Company or on Account of private Merchants, uniformly preferred to land them at Bundereeg, rather than at Bushire; fortunately however for the Port of Bushire, the Governor of Bundereeg was a character but little entitled to the confidence of the Merchants, the greatest part of whom, residing at Bushire, made frequent Commercial Trips from thence to Carrack and concluded large Purchases there of Spices and Sugars, which on their return to Bushire were dispatched from thence to Scherauze. The Port of Bundereeg depending entirely upon the settlement at Carrack for its Commercial Importance, relapsed naturally, into its former obscurity, on the Dutch withdrawing themselves from that Island. The Island of Bahreen situated on the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph, was at this Time annexed to the Government of Bushire, but the Court at Scherauze did not draw so much Advantage from the Possession thereof as might have been expected considering the421 rich Pearl Fishery in its neighbourhood. The other Petty Towns of Persia situated on the shore of the Gulph were then still less known to Kuropeans than they are present, but they neither then nor now, were, or are of consequence enough, to entitle them even to be mentioaed in this Report. The Anxiety and Solicitude which the 'Vakeel manifested for the Extension, of the Commerce of Persia, met with their proper Reward; and he had the pleasure, in the coarse of a few years to find, that he had in great measure restored order and Regularity, throughout the Extent of his Dominions. The Vigor or Langor of Commerce in Persia, depends entirely upon the degree of confidence, which the Merchant possesses in regard to the Government and the monthly receipt of the custom house at Scherauze arising from the moderate duty of 2 P. Cent, is perhaps the best Proof, which can be produced, of the confidence which the Merchants reposed in that of the Vakeel. Incredible almost as it may appear, there is sufficient Authority for advancing, that they amounted to the sum of Tomauns six Thousand. The most skillfull Workmen, in all the different Branches of the Manufactures of Persia were attracted to Scherauze, by the Liberality of the Vakeel, the fine Carpets of Khorasaun found their way, in abundance, to Constantinople and from thence to Europe, the Drugs, the natural produce of some of the Persian Provinces were exported to considerable quantities to Aleppo and India, and the Duties to be received by the Government on the Silk, produced in the Province of Ghilan alone, were fanned to an American Merchant for the sum of Tomauns four Thousand. It has been beforementioned, that the deficiency of the Records, relating to the Transac tions of the Factory does not allow of the Account of the sales made annually at that place, during this period, being mentioned in this report, but there is good reason to suppose that they were more various and more extensive, than they have ever been since amongst the Articles which the Hon'ble Company, then imported at Bushire, are to be found, besides their Woollens Carpets, Velvets, Metals, embossed Cloths, Brocades, and diferent Kinds of European Silks. It will not be deemed foreign to the subject in hand, to mention, that, upon the Records of the Hon'ble Company at Bussora, there stands a singular Instance of the attention, which Kerim Khan paid to, and of the Insight which he acquired into the true Interests of the Commerce of Persia. The Instance alluded to, is a Firmann published by this Prince forbid- ing the Exportation of specie, in which after enumerating the disadvantages which must ever arise to a Nation, which exports specie for the purpose of purchasing foreign Manufactures, he points out the many commercial Advantages, which Persia possesses in consequence of her natural Productions; and enforces the necessity of this subjects, who may be engaged in foreign Commerce availing themselves of a circumstance, which under proper Management must prove so beneficial to their Country. This Edict, although it was not carried into exe cution, to the full Extent of the Khans wishes, proved nevertheless highly serviceable, to the Commercial Interests of the Kingdom, and there is good reason to assert, that the Balance of Trade between Persia, India and Turkey, was at that Period, much more favourable to the former, than ever it has been since. As we approach to the present period, the commerce of Persia will be found iusensibly to • have declined, and although for, Want of the proper documents to procure which, no pains have been spared, the exact Proportion of its declension, cannot be ascertained, yet the two leading circumstances which operated, as the causes tnereof, are obviously perceptiule; for it cannot for a Moment be doubted, that the withdrawing of a Dutch settlement, from the Island of Carrack tended materially to its decrease, and that the death of the Vakeel, by throwing the Empire into confusion, gave it a still more fatal blow upon this latter Event, the most wealthy Merchants who bad during the Life time of the Vakeel, resided at Scherauze and transacted tht-ir Business in perfect security, finding themselves, suddenly exposed to every species of Extortion and Rapine, from the different competitors who immediately, sprang up for the Government, embraced in consequence thereof, the earliest opportunity of aban doning a Country, in which they with reason conceived neither their persons nor their Property to be any longer secure. Although the Death of Kerim Khan, took place early in the year 1779, yet the confusion caused thereby, had not m any degree subs, led, in the Southern Provinces of the Empire untill Jaafer Khar assumed the Government of Scherauze and its dependencies in the year422 1784. Political struggles^ especially in these countries, are always unfavourable both to Merchants ard mercantile Affairs^ but both, perhaps, suffered as little as the Nature of things would admit, during the contest for Empire between Jaafer Khan and his opponent Akan Mahomed Khan; since they mutually agreed, to permit coflas of merchandise, to pass in safety, in the districts of the Empire of which each was or might be in possession. Had Providence designed to Jaafer Khan a longer Life, had he been fortunate enough to have established himself in the Government of Persia, there is but little doubt, but that he would have trodden in the Footsteps of his uncle the Vakeel. At the time of his Assassination which happened in the month of January 1789, the merchants residing in the different cities, subject to his autliority, appeared to have considerable confidence, in the .stability and Equity of his Government; which appears to be well attested, from the Amount of the Imports from India in the year 1788, which were more considerable than any w hich had been made from the Death of the Vakeel to that Period, under his Government the Manufactures of the country would have received, and under the sanct on of his Pirmauns, the Hon'ble Company, might once more have reared their Flag in the interior parts of Persia, with security and dvanta^e. It has been jr.dged necessary to close at this period, the Acccunt of the past .-tate of the Commerce of Persia, and in the reV'oa of its present state, an opportunity will be taken of sptaking of the Manufactures and of the natural Productions of the Kingdom. Present state of the In entering upon this port of the report, a serious difficulty to the performino- it wifh Commerce of Persia. j- . i ^ • . , ' ' accuracy immediately presents itselt; for although it is possible, to ascertain, with some decree of precision, the annual Imports made into Persia by way of Bushire and Bussora, yet in regard to those, which are n adeinto that Kingdom from Aleppo by way of Bagdad, and from Russia by way of Eeshd and other plac s, bordering on the Caspian, the best Information which it has been possible to collect, appears to be Imperfect and defective. The de-ree of Commerc ; al Intercourse, which subsists between the North Eastern Provinces of Persia, and Usbesk TarWy is a Branch of the Per-ian Commerce, srill further excluded from the possibility of accurate irvestigation than those already mentioned; but as the report would appear incomplete without touching in some degree upon these subjects what will be hereafter ( fferedthereon, ig the Account affar led by the most Intelligent People of this Country, and as such is submitted with all diffidence to the Inspection of the British bovernment in India. The extinction of ihe commerce formerly carried on at the Port of Gombroon has been already remarked, as well as the consequent rise to commercial Importance of the Port of Bushire ; so that in liegard to the former, it is only necessary to observe, that it's present •Kxporfc are confined to a sn all quantity of dried and wet Fiuits and Tobacco to the Port of Muscat; from whence it imports Rice, Coffee, coarse and Bengal and Surat Goods sufficient for the consumption of the Town itself, and of the Inhabitants of the country within a few Miles &gt;'f its Neighbourhood. : The Road from Gombroon to Ispahan has been for many yeais, and continues still to be so unsafe for carravans, that it has fallen totally into disuse. The Island of Ormue, is not now frequented by European Vessels. It is governed by an Arab Shaik, and considerable quantities of Brimstone and Rock Salt, . re annually exported from thence in Boats to Muscat. The Port of Bushire is now the only one, of Importance; on the Persian shore of the Persian Gulph. Its Government partakes more of the Arabian, than the Persian form and Nature. The Shaik or Governor, is induced by motives of self Interest, to favor and protect in their Persons and Property as well the Resident Merchants as the Strangers that frequent the Port, and this protection was during the Life times, of the late Shaik Nassir and la.fer Khan extended to such a degree, as to involve the Shaik in veiy serious disputes with the Government of Schyras; from which, nothing but the unfortunate Assasination of laafer Khan could have extricated him with Impunity. The duties levied at Bushire, on Importations are very moderate, but it is impossible to state them with precision, since they are frequently varied, according to the Commercial Importance o the Importer, and according to the peaceful or confused state of the interior parts of the L.npire. During the Government of the late Shaik Nassir, the freedom of the Market suffered some degree of Restraint, for the Shaik himself being engaged in Commerce considered himself entitled on the arrival of Vessels and ioreign Merchants, to a preference, and to have the refusal of their Importations. This Evil was however in some Measure alleviated, by the Shaikh uniformly inviting the principal423 Merchants of the place, to take shares in the Purchases which he made; and therefore was only felt more severely, by the British Resident and the inferior orler of Merchants. The present Shaik Nessr, who succeeded his Father, in the Government of Bushire in the Month- of April 1789, has not yet engaged in commerce, but it is probable, that the Advice of his confidential Servants, may early induce him to tread in the footsteps of his Father. The principal Importation from India made at Bushire consists of the Chintz Manu- factures of the Coast of Coromandel; but this Branch of Commerce, seems to be much upon the decline, from a cause which will be hereafter mentioned, and for the removal of which it will appear very difficult to suggest any adequate Means. The greatest part of the Bengal Goods, imported at Bushire, are suited to and designed for the Bussora, Bagdad, Aleppo and other Northern Markets, and the only plausible reason which can be assigned for the proprietors landing them at that Place, is to wait for a favorable opportunity of defrauding the Bassora Governments of its Import Customs. The Importations of Surat Goods made at Bushire, are inconsiderable, but it appears that the Merchants have in the course of last and this year, given more attention to the Surat Trade than they were formerly accustomed to do. The Commercial Intercourse which sub-ists, between Bushire and Muscat by Boats, affords large Importations to the latter, of Sugar, Sugar Candy, Spices of various sorts. Coffee, Metals of different sorts and a variety of different petty Articles. The Sugar, Sugar Candy, Metals and Spices imported at Bushire, by Boats, from Muscat, is commonly brought to the latter on Dutch and French Vessels. The Merchant vessels also which annually leave Bengal for the Persian Gulph, generally dispose of part of their Gruff Freight, consisting of Sugar Candy, Iron and Plank, laden on board on account of the owners at Bushire; China and Glass Ware is often imported at Bushire from Bombay, on the Cruizers of the Honourable Company, and he demand for Indigo is supplied from Masulipatnam, by the arrival of the annual Bengal Merchant Vessels, touching at that Port. It is necessary to remark, for the Information of the British Government in India that the spirit of Mercantile Adventure in the Merchants at Bushire, will always rise or fall, in proportion to the Stability or Instability of the Govern ment at Sherauze. The Persian Merchant is obliged to make the greatest part of his returns to India, and of his Advances sent thither for the Purchase of Goods, in specie; which confines, the Export made from Bushire to India to an inconsiderable quantity of old Copper Drugs, Rose water dried Fruits &amp;. The specie exported from Bushire to India, consists of Venetian Sequins, and different sorts of Persian Silver Coin, but as the Exchange varies very much, and often proves severely disadvantageous to the Exporter he frequently prefers to export Gold and Silver in Bars; The Remaining Exp -rts made at Bushire, are confined to Muscat and Bussora, being made to the former in raw Silk, Cotton, Drugs and Dried Fruit, and to the latter inconsiderable quantities of Grain and Dried Fruits. Bushire holds a mutual Exchange of the different necessary Articles of Life, with a variety of petty Towns, situated on the Persian shore of the Persian Gulph, but it is conceived, that however these may tend to the advantage of che Vlercoants residing at that plac^, they are too insignificant to merit the notice of the British Government in India. Since the Capture of the Island of Bahreen, by the Arabs of the Tribe of Beniattaba, but little Intercourse has subsisted between the Inhabitants, of the opposite shores of the Persian Gulph: The port of Bunder Reeg, is distant from Bushire about six hours sail but at present it is not frequented, by any of the Merchant Vessels bound up the Gulph.— The Island of Camck only retains the Ruins of the Fort erected there by the Dutch and is not at present of the smallest Commercial Importance. — Shuster is a City of considerable Imr ortanee, in regard to the Commercial Intercours which subsists between it and Bussora; and on account of its manufacture of chintz, which as will be hereafter observed, has within these two last years met with peculiar Encourage ment. The Government of the City of Shuster, is nominally in the hands of a Khan, who secure in his situation, has for some years past but slightly acknowledged the superiority of the Government at Sherauze; but his Independence is restrained at home, by the Authority possessed by the Elders of the City who are always watchful to prevent his abuse of Power. By the Junction of different Rivers, there remains only two days Journey, to be performed by Land, between Bussora and Shuster, so that the communication is frequent and uninterrupted Bussora exports to Shunter Coffee, Pepper, Sugar, Cotton, Iron, Tin, Steel, Lead, Turmeric,Ginger, Muggadooties, and Indian piece Goods , and imports from thence, coarse Chintz coarse Cotton Cloths and a variety of other trifling Articles. The duties paid to the Government at Shuster are very moderate. It will now be necessary to present, Such Information as has been collected in Regard the conveyance of Merchandize into the interior parts of the Persian Empire ; in the Performance of which it seems best to divide the Parts, to which it is isent, into three Grand divisions, namely, the Eastern Western and middle parts of the Empire. To-begin therefore, with the Eastern Part of the ^Empire, which is supposed to include the Provinces of Mekran Sigestan, and the more southern parts of the Province of Khorasane it is necessary to premise, that the two first of these Provinces, are in such a state of Barbarisms and so exposed, to the predatory Excursions of the Ballouches, that no Merchant, is willing to send thither, 1 roperty to any considerable Amount, and that the very few foreign Articles which the Powerty of their Inhabitants, permits them to purchase, can only find their way thither by occasional conveyances from Kerman. The Southern Parts of Khorasan are supplied, with such foreign Articles as are in demand there, from Muscat by means of the' Indus, and the Northern parts of this Province are some times supplied, from the same place, when Impediments occur to it's communication with Ispahan or the Northern and Eastern Parts of Hindostan. Want of opportunity has prevented any Intelligence being obtained in Regard to the Expence of transporting Merchandize, from Muscat to the Southern Parts of tbe Province of Khorasan. In speaking of the means, by which Merchandize is conveyed from the Port of Bushire, to the middle Division of the Persian Empire, it is to be supposed that such Division, contains the entire Provinces of Faristan Kerman, Irak, Agemi and parts of the Provinces bordering thereon. Whenever the Road between Bushire and Sherause, is perfectly secure scarcely a week passes with out the arrival at that place of a carravan or Cofla from Sherauze, wbi^h returns thither after a Rest of two or three days, with , such Goods as the Merchants at Bushire, judge proper for the Markets of Ispahan and Sherauze. In these Times, the Goods designed for Ispahan are transported thither, after their arrival at Sherauze, in small Cofla. at different periods. VVhen the communication between Bushire and Scherauze is rendered unsafe, by the Khans of the districts through which the Road lies, having rebelled aganist the Government at Scherauze, or by any other circumstances, the Merchants send such Goods as they propose to vend at Ispahaun, part to Shuster, and part to Yezd; from thence to be conveyed, to the place of their destination. In such an Event too, especially when this Impediment continues for any length of Time, they keep up an Intercourse with Scherauze, by means of Yezd; but as this is expensive, it is never practised but in cases of necessity. The communication between Bushire and Yezd is seldom or ever interrupted, and the communication between Shuster and Ispahaun, though always hazardous, is seldom impracticable. The very large Coflas, which in peaceable Times go between Bushire and Ispahaun are managed after the following Manner. A Carravan from Ispahaun, sets out, laden with wet and dried fruits with an Intention of disposing of them at Scherauze,; on its arrival there these Articles are chiefly purchased by the Muleteers of Scherauze, who immediately proceed with them to Bushire, where after disposing of their Merchandize, they find, ready for them, a more valuable Lading with which they return to Sherauze ; on their arrival at that city, the Carravan belonging to Ispahaun, prepares for its Departure and returns to Ispahaun, with guch Goods, as the Merchants at Scherauze and Bushire, may judge proper for that Market. The space of Time which all of these Jonrnies require for their Performance, seldom exceeds fifty two Days. The Merchandizes received at Ispahaun, by these carravans, are conveyed from thence according to the demand they may be in, to the different Provinces bordering on the Caspian Sea, where they are generally bartered for Raw Silk, Drugs etc., thee Production of the Provinces, to which they are consigned. From Bushire to Scherauze, there are two different direct Routes, the one passing through Kaseroon, the other through Firouzabad. the merchants as well as the Chelmadars, of the Carravans, give the Preference to the former of these Routes, as abounding less with difficult Passes amongst the Mountains, and with greater Plenty of Forage for the Cattle of the Carravan.425 The expence, attending the transportation from Bushire t) Scherauze, of Bales of Merchandize to the weight of forty Maunds Tabreze or the Load of a Mule, varies from Bushire Rupees 22^ to Bushire Rupees 23^-, and of Bales of Merchandize to the Weight of 60 Maunds Tabreze, or the Load of a Camel varies from Bushire Rupees 25^ to Bustiire Rupees 26^-. Although no correct Information his, or can be obtained in respect to the Expence attending the Transportation of Merchandize from Ispahaun to Tauris, Reshd or any other Places in the Persian Empire, yet the framers of this report, (Jan assert with some degree of confidence, that the expence of Land carriage all over Persia is moderate and reasonable, and that taking the Amount charges, as above stated between Bushire and Scherauze, and supposing the distance between the two places, to be 200 Miles, it will afford, no bad Datum, for the calculation of the Expence of transporting Merchandize from one city to another, throughout the whole of the Persian Dominions. The Western Provinces of Persia, are supplied with such Goods, as they stand in Need of from India, by the Routes of Shaster and Bagdad. In the preceding part of this report it has been found necessary to speak of the% commercial Intercoure subsisting between Bussora and Shuster, and to specify the different Articles of Merchandize exported from the former to the latter, the greatest part of which are sent from thence to different cities in the Province of Louristan and the more Western Part of the Province of Irake Agemi. The Parts of the Persian Empire which receive Importations from Bagdad, are so situated in respect to climate, as to require but very small supplies of the Manufacturee of India, although they receive from thence considerable ones of English and Erench Woollens, . Venice, Ware, etc. Caravans proceed from Bagdad to Ispahaun by the Route of Kermanshah and Hamadan but they are neither frequent, nor are they ever considered as free from very imminent Risque. According to the most correct Information, which it has been possible to procure, the commercial Intercourse between the Persian Provinces bordering upon the Caspian Sea, and the city of Astrachan, is but small and it appears, that the Importations of Woollens into Persia by that Route has of late years been but inconsiderable. The Extension of the Persian Empire, occasions a considerable inland commerce, as the different Provinces naturally stand in need, of the productions of each other; and since it is not practicable exactly to specify the Nature of this commerce, it has been judged necessary for the information of the British Government in India, to enumerate such of the natural Productions and Manufactures of Persia, as have come to the knowledge of the framers of this report. The Province of Khorasaun, is generally esteemed the richest, in its natural Productions which consist in a variety of valuable Drugs, M ines of Iron and Copper, and Abundance of different kinds of Emit, which when dried make a considerable Branch of commerce. The Principal Manufactures of Khorasaun is that of carpets, which for the Brightness of their colours, and the Elegance of their Workmanship, are deservedly in high Estimation all over the World. Through this Province is introduced into Persia the fine Rhubarb, which formerly being conveyed to Europe by way of the Levant, falsely acquired the Name of Turkish Rhubarb. The Province of Kborasaun as well as the adjacent parts of Usbek Tartary, and of the Province of Mazanderan, produce great quantities of sheep, the chief advantage of which, proceeds from the skins of their Lambs, which being dressed in a particular Manner, become exceedingly beautiful, and are in high Estimation, both in Persia and Russia. The Productions of the Province of Mazanderan, are but little varied, from those already described fi g belong to Khorasaun. The Wealth of the Province of' Ghilan, consists in silk, Irak, Agemi, has to boast of a variety of valuable natural Productions, as Indigo, Tobacco, &amp;c., of the Manufactories of steel, which are carried on at Komm, and of silks and Brocades which are executed at Cachan. The Articles of the Growth of Farsistan, which appear most worthy of Remark, are cosiderable quantities of very fine Cotton, and the Poppy of the Vale of Kazeroon, from which, at present but little Opium is extrated for Foreign Exportation. This Opium, made at Kazeroon, is esteemed by Judges of that Drug to be superior to every other sort produced in Asia; and whenever the Political state of Affairs in Persia, shall resume a settled Appearance, Manufacture will in all probability be extended. The Manufactures ofGlass, Sword Blades, spearheads and un Barrels, &amp;c., carried on at Sherauze deserve to be men tioned, since it is from thence, that the different places in the Gulph are supplied with those Articles. The City of Yezd situated in that Part of the Province of Farsistan, which borders upon Kerman, is famous for its Manufactories of Brocades, Silks, Carpets and a fine kind of felt, called by the Persians Nummets. The Wool of a certain breed of sheep, peculiar to the Province of Kermaun, has long been an Article, very much esteemed in Europe. The Hon'ble the President and Council at Bombay, agreeably to their desire, had in the year 1788 full Information given them by the framers of this report, in respect to the possibility of procuring for the Hon'ble Company such quantities of this Wool, as they might from Time to Time require; from which, it appeared, that in consequence of the thriving state of the Shaul Manufactures and of the Prohibition, which was laid on the Exportation thereof, by Jaafer Khan, that it was by certain means only practicable, annually to procure the Weight of Tabreze Maunds three Thousand. These means will be stated in that part of the Report which contains the Ideas of the framers of this report, upon the subject of the Measures, best calculated to promote an extension and produce a revival, of the British Commerce in the Persian Empire. The City of Shuster in the Province of Louriston, is remarkable, for its Manufacturies of Chintz and coarse Cotton Cloths. Mekran and Segistan, are two Provinces, of which no exact Information either of their Manufactures or Productions, has been obtained; and the chief Wealth of the Province of Laristan, consists in Grain. The variety of W ines, produced in Persia, in the hands of an industrious people, protected by a well regulated Government, would become a great source of Wealth, both to individuals and to the State; and in the hands of such a People, and under such a Govern ment, she would certainly reap more Advantages than she does at present from the Exporta tion of Tobacco, Dried Fruit, Rose Water, and Otter of Roses. The mountains of Persia abound in quarries of fine Marble and red stone, and Mines both of Gold and Silver, though not rich enough to defray the Expence of working them, are to be found in many of the Provinces. An Account of a new Branch of Commerce which has been opened within these two year's past, by several Merchants residing at Bashire, will now be laid before the British Government in India, and the framers of this report, in a subsequent Part of it, will offer to them their Ideas in regard to the advantage, which might accrue to the Hon'ble Company by their engaging therein. The Merchants before alluded to, dispatched Factors in charge of Adventures, to a considerable Amount, consisting chiefly of Woolens Bengal Piece Goods, Masuliptnam Cuintz, European Fire Arms, &amp;c., to Candahar, and Cabool. The factors were directed to proceed from Bushiie to Muscat, to take a favourable opportunity of transporting themselves, and the Merchandizes committed to their care to Scindy, and to take Advantage of the stream of the Indus, as far as the city of Mooltan ; from whence, it was supposed, they would find Caravans frequently departing for Candahar. Some of these factors, have lately returned, and the Information which they give in regard to the object of their Mission, is highly favourable and flattering. They mention, that on their arrival at Candahar, they were treated with every sort of Indulgence by the Government, and that in an Audience, to which their were admitted, with Timour Shah. The Shah professed himself highly pleased at their arrival in his Dominions, enquired much, after many different sorts of European Manufactures and repeatedly declared, that he would uniformly, and on all occasions, shew the utmost Favor, and grant the most liberal Protec tion, to all Merchants who might be induced to visit his country for the sake of commerce. They likewise mention, having disposed of the adventures in their charge for a considerable Profit, and it is imagined, that the Articles in which they made their returns consisting of Shauls, Jewels and Drugs, must have yielded a still further Profit to their Employers. The purchases of Shauls, made at Candahar by the factors aforementioned, prove that a communication between that place and the Province of Cashmire is open, and the framers of this report, have sufficient Reason to believe, that Caravans also frequently pass between that place and the cities of Balk and Samercand. The Climate of Tartary obliges its Inhabitants to cloath themselves in warm Garments ; the poor are and must be content, with their own coarse stuffs and the skins of their Flocks, but the rich, seek for the more elegant attire of European Woolens. According to the best In formation, the wants of these latter in this respect, are supplied from Russia across the Caspian427 Sea by Eoesian and Tartar Merchants, residing at Astrachan. It is conceived, that the Woollens and different Articles so supplied by Russia to the Tartar Kingdom of Karasm are to a large annual Amount, and it is presumed that as the Extension of the sale o£ their Woollens, has always been recommended by the Hon'ble Company, any Measures {or the promotion thereof, void of imminent Risks, are not unworthy of their Notice. Upon these Grounds m the subsequent part of this Report, will be inserted such as appear to have at least a Probability of throwing the supply of Woollens required as aforementioned, into the hands of the Hou'ble Company. As it appear suffleiently obvious from the proceeding part of this K«port, that the sole Measures wlioh cause to which the decline of the commerce of Persia can be justly imputed, is the confusion 'PPT !' ost ''i' m which for some years past the Government has been involved, it has been therefore judged print BriS unnecessary to give a detail of this decline, under a separate head or Division ' Commerciel Inter- mi ^ j • j i*i course with Persia g entiments and ideas, are now offered to the Inspection of the British an( * countries Government in India with Diffidence and respect. Some of them are formed upon Experience, lK,r(i8ring UI ' &gt;n assisted by local knowledge, and some of them upon the Information, obtai nod from the most intelligent Merchants residing at Bushire and Bussora. There appear at present to exist several serious obstacles, to any very great Extension of the sale, of British Manufactures in the Kingdom of Persia ; and in Regard to those of India, it is presumed that the country Merchants, will never fail to import supplies, equal to the demand or the Market: but it may be reasonably supposed, that the commerce which the Hon'ble Company carry on to Persia may be put upon a footing more advantageous to them than the one on which it stands at present; and, that if the Measures hereafter pointed out for that purpose should be carried into Execution, they will tend to infuse a more adventurous and actives pirit of Commerce, amongst the private Persian Merchants. It has been already mentioned how inimical to commerce, the Different Revolutions in the Persian Government, have always proved, but as the country possesses great internal sources of Wealth, a few years of a mild and regular Administration, might not only prevent the present decline, but even raise its commerce to its former Importance. The languishing state of the Hon'ble Company's commerce, at the Port of Bushire, has for some time past, given occasion to the framers of this report, to form an opinion, that the Factory there either ought to be placed upon a different Establishment to the present one, or ought to be withdrawn, as a useless Expence to the Hobble Company. The framers of'this report are however more inclined to favor the former of these opinions, than the latter, and humbly conceive that, the Establishment of a Factory at the Port of Bushire, upon the Plan hereafter mentioned, would prove a measure of much public|utility. In the prtsent impoverished state of Persia, it will be necessary, in order to increase the demand and consumption of British Manufactures, to advert to what advantages mav be gained by bartering, the commodities of Great Britain for those of Persia. Upon this Plan, it is presumed the Merchants will often be induced to make very considerable Purchases at Times, when they might even be unable and unwilling, to conclude them for Specie. The framers of this report in year 1788, furnished the Government at Bombay, with some necessary hints on the subject of the Drugs, the Produce of Persia and of the country adjacent thereto; and they are of opinion, that a commerce of the most beneficial Nature, to the Hon'ble Company, might be prosecuted by an Exchange of different European Articles, for the Article of medicinal Drugs. It is obvious, that the several Drugs procurable in Persia, would reach the British Hospitals in India, in a much higher state of Preservation than those which are at present received by way of Europe ; since many of such Drugs are the produce of Persia, and are sent to Europe by way of Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople. The liberal policy, observed by the Hon'ble Company, on all occasions, has ever induced them to pay particular attention to every possible and probable means, for the preservation of the health of their Troops and of the different persons engaged in their Employ, it is therefore presumed, that the possibility of procurmg, a constant supply of fresh medicinal Drugs, in a climate in which even the freshet-t, soon loose something of their natural virtue, is an object worthy of their Attention. It is humbly conceived also, that in case it shall hereafter be found practicable, to extend a com mere- of this Nature, to a certain Extent, it will be productive of public utility. TheHon'ble Company's Hospitals in India, will as has been beforementioned reap considerable Advantage, the Hon'ble Company, will be enabled to export annually larger quantities both of the Manufuctures and Natural Productions of Great Britain, than they do at present, and it may reasonably be supposed, now the Passage from India to Europe is reduced, to a certainly, thai they will be able to send many Articles, the produce of Persia to the different markets in Europe at a much cheaper rate, than thay can be brought there from any other quarter. W ith a view of promoting a Scheme, apparently so beneficial in its conseqtienees the Framers of this report, beg leave to submit to the consideration of the British Govern-- ment in India, the means which in their opinion seem best calculated, to promote the success both of it, and of the wishes, which the Hon'ble Company have expressed, to receive an annual Supply of Carmenia Wool. It is presumed, that the first step necessary to be taken, for this Purpose is for the British Government at Bombay, to order one of the civil Servants upon that Establishment to proceed into persia, without Loss of Time; and to give him Instructions to penetrate into the different Provinces of the Empire, as far as the situation of Affairs will admit, to inform himself as minutely as possible of 'the natural Productions of each Province, of the special o£ our Manufactures of which it may stand most in Need, of the probable annual Amount of the consumption of the same, and of the present state of its Government. By these means the Indents which it will be necessary to transmit to Europe, will be framed Mith a great degree of Precision ; correspondencies will be formed with the different principal Merchants at each place, the necessary forms will be adjusted with Government, and the Gentlemen to whose care, the Management of the Hon'ble Company's Affairs in Persia, may be entrusted will be furnished, with authentic Materials for the conduct and measures, which it may be necessary for them to persue. A commission of this nature, or of lone similar to it, if performed with Fidelity, and Accurateness, will prove a Task of no small difficulty ; and it will be indispen-^ sably necessary in case the sentiments thereon above expressed, are meant to be carried into Execution, that the Person, so sent, to a competent knowledge of the Persian Language should also join a knowledge of the Manners, and Cuttoms of the People, with whom iu the course of his commission, he may have to negotiate, or of whom he may be obliged to seek for information. With every possible Advantage on his side, it is conceived from Experience ( that he must, and will, have greater reason to solicit the indulgent reception of the fruits of his Enquiries, than to hope that they will produce him any addition of Fame. Another measure, wich appears to the framers of this report, to be a necessary one , and which they accordingly with respect recommend to be adopted by* the British Govern ment at Bombay is an alteration in the present Establishment of the subordinate of Bushire. The Framers of this report conceive that not only in respect to the Prosecution of the Plan aforementioned, but in respect to the general commerical Interests of the Hon'ble Company in Persia, it would be adviseable to give the Title of the Hon'ble Company's, ' Resident in Persia ' with an Authority to reside occasionally as he may judge most proper either at Scherauze or Bushire, to the Gentleman to whom the Management of their Affairs in that Country may be entrusted, and also to encrease the Establishment of covenanted Servant in Persia, by appointing to the Assistance of the Resident a W riter, always to remain at Bushire; and a Surgeon will skilled in the qualities of medicinal Drugs, for the purpose of inspecting those which the Resident may wish to procure on account of the Hon'ble Company. On its present Establishment, the Hon'ble Company in the opinion of the framers of this report, do not derive any, or if any, very little advantage from the Factory at Bushire. On the plan abovementioned, although the Expenses of the Establishment must necessarily be encreased, there is a great Probability that the Hon'ble Company will receive advantages more than adequate thereto. The late and present Government at Scherauze, was and is according to the firmauns received by the Resident at Bussora, very anxious for the ex tension of British commerce in Persia. In the year 1787 when Mr. Jones visited Scherauze for the benefit of his Health, Jaafer Khan repeatedly, in the several Audiences to which that Gentleman was admitted, expressed his desire of seeing Europeans settled at Scherauze; and if the Matter has not been misrepresented he was at the time of his Assaslination on the point, of causing Application to be made at Bombay, for an alteration of the Establishment of the Factory at Bushire. A firmaun from Lutf Ally Khan, the present Ruler at Scherauze, to the429 Resident at Bussora, received in the Month of June last, contains a passage sufficiently strik ing to justify its Insertion in this report. ' And in as much as our late ' Royal Father of happy Memory, whose Habitation is now in ' Paradise, formerly made known to you his fabourable Intentions in Regard to such of your ' Nation, as might enter his Dominions on a design of comroeree we also think it necessary to u mention, that our good will and Regard for your Nation, exceeds that of our late Royal ' Father; and that we earnestly desire, to see the curious Merchandizes of Europe, brought to ' Scherauze for sale, and we faithfully promise to behave in all respects to your People, accord ing to former usuages and customs, and to grant and secure to them every Priviledge and ^Indulgence, which they enjoy at Bussora.' As the Importation to England of raw silk from Persia, bas long since, it is presumed, ceased to be an object of Attention to the Hon'ble Company, the framers of this Report, will therefore confine what further they have to observe on the subject before them, to stating the different Articles, of the produce and Manufactures of Great Britain, which in their opi nion may be vended in Persia; and to the Expression of such sentiments, as they have formed relative to the prosecution of a commerce with the Eastern and Northern Provinces of Persia, with advantage to the Hon'ble Company. It is necessary however to promise, and to acquaint the British Government in India, that Persia at present is an exhausted Kingdom, that the great Influx of Wealth which it received by the Expedition of Nadir Shah against Delhi, has nearly reverted to India, and that the following circumstances will more or less, always tend, to encrease the scarcity of specie, in that Kingdom. Nine Tenths of the Imports from India into Persia, are at present purchased with specie, of which not the smallest part ever returns into the country not less, than Ten- thousand Persians annually leave the different parts of Persia, to make Pilgrimages to Ker- balloy and Mecca ; if it is computed therefore that each of these Pilgrims at the time of his entering the Turkish Dominions, is furnished with the moderate sum of Piastres Twenty, for the necessary Expence of his Journey, it will be found, that this single circumstance alone drains the Kingdom annually of Two hundred thousand Piastres. The Princes of the house of Seffi, were sinsible, how detrimental these Pilgrimages were to the Interests of Persia and succes sively endeavored, as much as possible, to lessen their repute. If at that time they were found to be detrimental, it may be reasonably supposed that at the present Period, they must be much more so. The Kingdom then enjoyed the Blessings of internal Peace and a well established Government; and the Pilgrim often to the advantage of the state carried with him, instead the of specie, such of the Manufactures or Produce of his Country, as were in demand, in the coun tries through which he had to pass. The arrival in those days at Bagdad, of the great Caravan of Persian Pilgrims,- produced in that City, for some Days, all the hurry and Business of a fair. The Turkish Merchants at Bagdad were ready to purchase the raw silk, the Drugs, the Carpets, the Shauls and ever other species of Merchandize which the Pilgrims might have brought with them, and the different European firms established at Aleppo, Smyrna &amp; Co of the arrival of these articles at those places, purchased them for the different Markets of Europe. In the present Times from the intestine Wars which have so long desolated Persia as well as from the change, which has taken place in the Commerce of the Levant, the Persian Pilgrim has no , other mode of defraying the Expences of his Pilgrimage, than that of bringing along with him, a sufficient quantity of specie. The framers of this report, in speaking of the Articles of the Manufactures and Produce of Great Britain which in their opinion are suited to the demand of the Markets of Persia, flatter themselves that such part of their sentiments thereon, as are founded on speculation, will meet with an indulgent and lenient reception; since notw.thstanding they may have arisen from cir cumstances and information, apparently the most undeniable and correct, many accidents, which no human foresight can preconceive, may in a country situated like Persia in case the British Government in India should be decline to carry any of them into Execution, tend to a failure of success. ^ , _ . It is presumed, in regard to promoting the demand for Woollens in Persia, that two points are essentially necessary to be observed ; the first of which is that as the assortments for the Gnlph Markets are made up in England the strictest care be taken, that no other colours are admitted therein, than those which may be mentioned in the Indents framed by the Servant430 of the Hon'ble Company residing in Persia, and secondly that the present mode of sending an Assortment of all the different kinds of Woollen, be changed for that of sending only those best adapted to the Markets of Persia. The superstition of the Persians, is already generally known, and it may be easily conceived how detrimental an Idea of many of the colours of which it is composed, being unfortunate, must prove to the disposal of an Assortment o£ woollens. Many of the colours of the Assortments of Woolens, sent by the Hon'ble Com pany to Persia, are in the opinion of the Persians so outrageously outre, that no one thinks of wearing them, they being as little. adapted to their Taste for their upper Garments, as a bright yellow would be to that of an Englishman. Local observation induces Mr. Jones to- suppose that the spotted and striped cloaths generally known by the name of Orleans Cloth- would be very vendible in Persia. The Winter dress of a Persian Gentleman, requiries many of the manufactures of.Europe. His upper Garment is of velvet or fine cloth, his under one of Sattin, bis cap is partly composed of velvet and partly of cloth, his Chuckchoors, which he wears in the place of stockings are of cloth, and if he is a man of any Rank the dress is not compleat, without the addition of Brocade. Upper these Grounds the framefs of this report, conceive, that a proper Assortment of Velvets, Satins, Silks and Brocades might be annually disposed of in Persia. Notwithstanding the Patterns of Norwich and Manchester Manufactures, sent to the- Factories at Bussora and Bushire, by the Hon'ble the President and Council at Bombay iti the year 1788, were returned to that Presidency, with an opinion from both Factories, that they would not answer the Gulph Markets, it is conceived, that for want of an opportunity of laying them open, to the Inspection of the Merchants at Scherauze, such an opinion may here after be found, to have been a very erroneus one in respect to Persia. From the Information given to the framers of this report, by Mr. Jones, there were many of the Patterns, the Qualities and Colour of which were exceedingly well adapted to the Taste of the Persians and the only Doubt, which they entertain of their not being vendible in Persia, is the price at which it could be afforded to Invoice them; and it is therefore further conceived, that a small consignment of these Articles, might be made to the Factory at Bushire. The most sanguine opinion, is entertained in regard to the possibility of disposing of large Quantities of hard-Ware ; and the universal Estee;n, which the Persians have, for Glass of all sorts affords Hoom for an opinion, that this Branch of: British Manufacture, would meet with good Encouragement in Persia. It will probably be found upon experiment that a proper assortment of the different kinds of Carpets, manufactured in England would meet with a favorable reception in Persia, provided the original price of them was moderate. An idea is also entertained, that a careful Enquiry after the different dye? made use of in the manufacturing carpets in Khorasaun, would be produc tive of much benefit to our own. The Wilton and Axminister carpets, are for superior to the finest of Persia, inpoin of Arrangement of Pattern, and at first and for some short Time after- wards, in point of Colour, but the complaint is universal that in the course of a litde use the colours loose their Brightness. On the other\and the carpets manufactured in Persia, from the Superior Quality (it is imagined) of the Dye preserved to the very last, their original Brilliancy of Colour. Little Doubt can be entertained, if the British Government in India make the Commerce to Persia an object of their Attention, but a very considerable Quantity of the different Metals annually exported from England by the Hon'ble Company, would meet an advantageous and ready sale in that Kingdom; and that several other Articles of Commerce, which mentioned saparately might a .pear trivial would be demanded; since the Persians, are a People much inclined to Luxury and Show. The framers of this report, have not touched upon the Import Commerce of India to Persia, because they are well convinced that the Merchants of Persia themselves, will always carry it on to as great an Extent as it wiU bear, and because they cannot conceive that the British Government in India, can by any act of theirs tend, to its incr ase; if any thing will advantageously affe;t this branch of Persian Commerce, the framers of this report conceive nothing to be more likely to do so than the Establishment of a Factory, in the Manner mentioned in the preceding part of this report. In the Evt-nt o£ the British Go/eminent in India, eemiag to a determination to prove how far it woulc' accord with the Interests of the Hon'ble Oompauy to attempt to throw431 in a supply of Woollens to Factory, the framers of this report, offer them their Idea of the means, by which it is probable it may be performed with the least Risk, and the fairest hopes of advantage to the Hon'ble Company. The old Factory at Sciudy with some repairs, would be ready to receive a Resident, a Writer and a proper consignment of Woollens, and Metals to these Gentlemen, should be added a third, who, should proceed to Moultan, with the hopes of being able to meet there, with Merchants ready to contract for the Goods lying in the Factory at Scindy; but in the Event, of these hopes being frusti'ated, he should have it in his Instructions, to proceed even to Kandahar where it is imagined, he could hardly fail, of being able to effect the purpose of his Mission. By these Means, no Risk whatever would arise to the Hon'ble Company, since to Merchn- dizes of which the adventure might be composed, would be paid for, and delivered by the Resident, at Scindy. The Gentleman dispatched to Moultan and Kandahar, would have an opportunity of procuring correct Information in regard, to the Extent and advantages of a commerce of this kind, and in the Event of its not answering such Expectations, as might be formed of it, nothing further would remain, but to order the Servants at Scindy to return to the Presidency of Bombay. It is supposed, that the Government at Bombay have a better opportunity, than the framers of this report, of becoming acquainted with the actual state of the Government of Scindy but according to the Information, which they have had an opportunity to collect, it appears to be secure as well as favorable to Mercantile designs. R emarks applicable to the C ommerce op A rabia and P ersia. The following remarks are submitted with respect to the consideration of the British Government in India.— In obedience to the commands of British Government in India considerable exertions have been made, to collect the Information, necessary for the Formation of exact Lists of the annual Importations, made during the last seven years, at the different P9rts of the Persian Gutph, and of the Red Sea; and of the Exportations made from thence to India in that period The Intelligence collected on the subject, has proved however extremely partial, incorrect and unsatisfactory, and it has been found impossible, to obtain the object of Pursuit. The Dffii- culty of procuring Information relative to the Commerce of the Red Sea, the Incorrectness .of the Custom House Accounts, at most of the Ports of the Persian Gulph, the Practise of smuggling prevailing at those Ports, and the Inability of some of the Governors of those Ports, to afford the required communications, are causes which have operated to prevent the desired success. The Desire entertained by the British Government in India, to encrease the commercial Intercourse, between that country and the Persian Gulph, and the Red Sea, will necessarily urge the servants of the Hon'ble Company now stationed, and those that may in future be stationed there, to exert themselves strenuously for the beneficial Accomplishment thereof. It is however conceived, that the Hon'ble Companys future consignments to Bussora can only consist of the Articles already particularized and that the Residency of Bushire, cannot possibly on its present Plan, prove an advantageous Establishment.— It may not be improper here to a remark, that a very serious obstacles, to the'Increase of the British Commercial Intercourse between India and the Persian Gulph, is occasioned, by the unwearied attention of the Merchants of those countries to their own Interest. As Losses arise on all Remittances made from the Persian Gulph to India the Commerce, between them, must ever depend on the state of the Markets of the Former, which are generally overstocked with Indian Commercial Articles ; and as the Merchants beforementioned, are active indus- trians speculative and well informed, and have not any other mode, of employing their Fortunes, than in Commercial Pursuits* they are careful to profit, by every opportunity of conveying to the Gulph, the Merchandizes that may be in Demand there.— It has already been remarked in this report that a Loss has arisen on all the remittances latterly made from Persian Gulph to India, and it may therefore naturally be concluded, that the Hon'ble Company's Remittances to India, in the Event of the Commerce being there increased will labour under Disadvantage, if however, their Remittances are made to the Presidency of Bombay, on the vessels belonging to them which are annually sent from thence to Bussora, whether they consist of Treasure, or of Gruff Articles of Merchandize, they will no be liable to the charge of Freight, and in that respect, the Hon } ble Company will have the432 Advantage of private Traders. The Hon'ble Company may have a further advantage of private Traders. It is understood fhat the Hon'ble Company suffer a very considerable Loss, in the Remittances made by the British Government in Bengal, to the Presidency of Bombay, for the purpose of defraying the Expences of that Establishment. If the Produce of such consignments as may be hereafter made to Bussora, on the public Account, is ordered to be remitted to Bombay, on the Vessels belonging to the Hon'ble Company, which are annually sent from thence to Bussora, the Loss in Question will be avoided ; and Loss avoided, may fairlv be considered as Gain. It is conceived, that the Hon'ble Company might with Proprietv derive an Advantage from the Commercial Intercourse carried on between India and the Persian Gulph, by means of Vessels, under British Colors, of which they have hithtjrto generously declined to avail themselves. From the year 1780 to the present Period, the British Individuals Resident in India, in a few Instances only excepted, have ceased to engage, in the Commerce of the Persian Gulph, and the Trade carried on between those countries by means of Vessels under British Colors has therefore, been principally cultivated by the Armenian and Moslem Merchants Resident in the British Settlements in India, under the Protection of that Government, in vessels pricipally their Property, furnished with British Passes, and navigated by British Captains and Officers. It has long been customary, in virtue of the Kesident at Bussora, being in Possession of a consulary Birat, for the representatives of the Hon'ble Company at the Ports of Hussora and Bushire, to collect, a consulage of 2 per cent, on all Imports, the Property of British Individuals made there, which consulage formerly amounted to a considerable annual sum. Until the year 1784, the consulage collected at each of those Ports was equally divided between the Hon^'ble the President at Bombay, and the Residents there. The consulage since collected, which in consequence of the Trade carried on between India and the Persian Gulph, having been principally cultivated by Armenian and Moslem Merchants, has dwindle to a mere Trifle, has in obedience to the commands of the Hon'ble Company been divided into equal shares, one of which has been uniformly carried to their credit. The security which the property of the Armenian and Moslem Merchants beforementioned derives from its conveyance in vessels of the foregoing Descriptions, and the dangers to the Interests of the Hon'ble Company in the Persian Gulph, anl the difficulties to their Servants stationed there, which generally attend, and which during the late Revolutions in the Government of Bussora, have so very particularly attended, the granting protection to those vessels, are considerations of so serious a nature, as to establish an opinion that all property imported at Bussora and Bushire, in vessels under British Colors, should in Justice be sub jected, to the payment to the representatives of the Hon'ble Company at those Ports of the two per cent, consulage in Question. The British Government in India, will judge of the Propriety of issuing the necessary orders for that purpose. The value of the Imports made in the year 1787, at the Ports of Bussora and Bushire, in vessels under British Colors, amounted to near twenty Lacks of Rupees, and it is to be supposed that when peace takes place between the ottoman Emperor and his European Enemies, and the present troubles in the Government of Persia, begin to subside, the annual Imports at Bussora and Bushire, in vessels under British Colors, will exceed in value the beforementioned sum. The share of the consulage thereon, which in the Event of orders being issued by the British Government in India, for its collection, would become the Property of the Hon'ble Company, would amount to a sum, worthy of their attention, and the remaining share thereof if allowed by British Government in India, to became the property of the Residents at Bussora and Bushire, would prove to them very acceptable Emoluments, and enable them with more Facility, to support, in a becoming stile, the expensive establishments, of their respective stations. . Tlie paymeilt of tliree P er Cent - Company's duties, and two per Cent, consulage, by British subjects, on all their importations made at Bussora, to the representatives at the place of the Hon'ble Company, has been already mentioned, as a Disadvantage attending the British Commerce in that Quarter, and it is conceived that the 83rd Paragraph of the Hon'ble Company's General letter to Bombay of the 6th April 1763, was meant to give relief to theBritishTrader, and might justify, in certain cases the non-collection of the Customs in question at the Ports of Bussora and Bushire. The following is the Paragraph above mentioned. ' It appears but equitable that all Goods which have paid duties to us at Tellicheny, or any other of our Factories should be excused paying the same over again, when imported afterwards at Bombay, or other of our settlements provided the Property of such Goods is not altered. But if the Customs of the Place, to which the Goods are exported exceed the Customs first paid, then the full Duties are to be charged to the owner, and he only allowed to draw back, the sum collected from the Importer at the Factory, where they were first sold ; and this, we apprehend, to have been the General Practise heretofore, particularly for Goods bought at Bombay and sent to Surat and sold there. The case is quite different, when the property is changed, for then the customs at the last port, must be collected in full, from the importer, without having any regard to what may have been done before he bought or became possessed of the same Goods and no drawback must be allowed without producing certificates of the customs, having been paid at the Port where they were sold.' The Navigation of the Persian (-»ulph, is plain and easy, and although, the Strong northerly winds, which generally prevail in it, in th^ Months of June and July render the Passage from Muscat to any of its Ports, both boisterous and tedious and the violence of the South-west Monsoon, prevents during the Months of June, July, August, and Septeuaber, direct Passages being made from the Ports of India to Muscat, yet by perseverence and skill, a passage may be made in a well found European vessel from any of those ports to Bussora, at any Season : such a vessel, may with Propriety sail from Bussora on a voyage to any Port in India, on any day in the year. In the navigation of the Persian Gulph, some danger is justly to be apprehended from Pirates. Informer Times some English vessels have been taken by them, and therefore although the Persian Gulph, is now on a tolerably settled and peaceable state, and the British Flag is there treated with great respect; a weak, unarmed British vessel, ought not to be suffered to undertake a voyage from any of the Ports in India, to Bussora. The Dows and Gallivats, belonging to the Different Ports, in the Persian Gulph are vessels of very considerable Force, and many of their crews, particularly those, who navigate the Oows, belonging to the Islands and Coasts, in the vicinity of Ormus, are rapacious and inclined to the commission of unjustifiable Acts of violence On falling in with them, a power of self Defence. Defence is the best security that the commander of an English vessel can have for their good behavior. The Framers of the present report, have in the course of it respectfully ventured, to giv e it as their opinion that the Establishment of British faclaries at the Ports of Mocha and Muscat, might prove Measures beneficial to the Commercial Interest of the Hon'ble Company, and that a new modification of the Residency at Bushire, might tend materially to the Increase of the British^Commercial Intercourse with the Kingdom of Persia. It is a remark equally applicable both to Persia and Arabia, that the merchants of those countries are pleased at the Establishment therein of European Kactories conceiving the Heads of them to be eligible Mediators between themselves and the Government, in times of Difficulty and Distress. The Framers of the present Report, beg leave previous to its conclusion, to give it as their decided opinion, that the success of the British general Commercial Intercourse with Arabia and Persia, and of the particular Plans for its Encrease which they have pointed out must ever principally depend on the Propriety of the conduct of the Gentlemen, under whose management, they may be prosecuted, and to express a Hope, that as the Duties of their sta tions, must necessarily often, place them in situations, replete with Delicacy and Difficulty, their Hon ; ble Employers will fix their Intentions, not their success, as the criterion by which to judge of their Merits. In order to facilitate the Transaction of Commercial affairs at those Places, where English Facbories are, or may in future be established, the servants of the Hou'ble Company must uniformly by steady temperate and cautions measures endeavor to acquire sufficient influence, with the people of the Government to secure their constant and effectual Support and Favor, and by a mild and easy mode of managing Business strive to give Encouragement to such Merchants as may wish to have Dealings with them, who might by contrary conduct be deterred making offers advantageous to the Hon'ble Company;434 and in order to secure, a peaceable, and safe Navigation of the Persian Gulph, to British vessels, the Commanders of such vessels, must uniformly observe a wary and moderate conduct. They must be prepared for Defence and cautions not to offend. Wanton acts of Hostility and negligent Security are equally dangerous Imprudencies. (Sd.) SAMUEL MANESTY. (Sd.) HARFORD JONES. B ussoea ; The 15th August 1790.Appendix Gr. Report of Mr. Maister, Custom Master, Bombay, and Mr. FawGett ) Accountant General, Bombay^ on the state of trade between India and JPersia, and suggestions as to the means far improving it. December 1799. Bombay Castle, December 17th, 1799. To—The Hon'ble Mr. Jonh Ddncan , President and Governor in Council, Bombay. Hon'ble Sir, In obedience to your commands to report upon the ancient and present state o£ trade with Persia, we have used every possible means to obtain full information on the subject and beg leave to lay before you the result of our researches. With respect to the former state of trade we find there has been for many years so little intercourse immediately from this part of India, that the oldest mei'chants could give us no information on the subject; we were consequently reduced to the necessity of deriving the whole of our information from the records of Government which we were aware must naturally treat chiefly on the Company^ own affairs or only that branch of our object of enquiry, which went to the trade in European articles, with occasional tracts that may enable us to make some estimate of the trade between India and Persia. The oldest Diary of the Factory of Gombroon, in existence here in for the 1741-42, when the trade of that port is stated to be on the decline; the Company had an Agent and Council establislied at that place, and Residents under them at Bussora, Ispahan and Carmenia, and possessed certain privileges under the Rogoms of the Kings of Persia ; the first and principal of which was granted them by Shaw Abbas exempting them of payment of duties, but which was unfortunately lost at Ispahan, and neither copy nor memorandum of its contents preserved nor can we anywhere find copies of the other Rogoms, but the following list of those granted by Nadir Shaw appears in a subsequent diary. List of Rogoms granted to the Hon'ble Company by Shaw Nadir, viz.— No. 1.—A Rogomto the Governor and Omallsof Spahaun that the English, being always free of customs, etc., as by attested copies of Rogoms from former Kings produced to him, and which he has caused to be registered continued to be so confirming the privileges from the former Kings of Persia, annulling the Customs Master's Rogom against the Hon'ble Company and orders that nothing be taken on those accounts. ;N 0&gt; 2.—A Rogomto the Resident at Spahaun that he has received his petition about the Custom Masters, and the Rogoms from the former Kings, that he now sends a Rogom (the foregoing) upon that subject and that he will not suffer his people to make any new customs and whatever he petitioned to hope a favourable regard would be shewn to it. No. 3.—A Rogom to all the Governors of Persia not to borrow any money of the English or their servants, or have any imposition of goods, etc., put upon them on any account and whatever place they are in, to be treated with great civility. ^■ 0f 4.—A Rogom to the Omalls of Carmenia for paying the Company 570 Tomandes, on account of perpets taken reproving them for doing it, and forbidding them to take any goods without paying ready money. No. 6.—A Rogom ordering all Governors, Viziers, Dorogas and other officers to treat the English civilly, as there has been a long friendship between the Kings of England and Persia and the English are Kings' guests. No. 6.—A Rogom that none force the Chief or his servants and if they sell any, to be paid for them in ready money. No. 7.—A Rogom confirming all the privileges we have from him. No. 8.—A Rogom about civility, and that no injustice be exercised towards our trade, and to pay ready money for any goods wanted of the English.436 No. 9.—A Rogom about civility, against borrowing money, if done to be returned. No. 10—A Rogom ^o the Governors, etc., on the road to and from Gombroon, wherein he orders them to give a guard for our Paphilas if in case of necessity. No. 11.—A Rogom about Matheus Armenian who pretended a demand upon the Hon'ble Company of 3,000 Tomands for debts owing him in India ; this also confirms the Rogom for recovery of debts. No. 12.—A Rogom for our Linguists'' house to be free of head-money. No. 13.—A Rogom for six Banians to be free of head-money : 3 at Spahaun and 3 at Gombroon. No. 14.—A Rogom to the Governor of Spahaun to treat the English with respect and not suffer any trouble to be given them. No. 15.—A Rogom to Meer Abba or head of the water, for to let us have water for our house at Spahaun. No. 16.—A Rogom for liberty to make wine and drink wine at Shyrash or any other place. No. 17.—A Rogom for liberty to bring our goods to our house at Spahaun and dispose of them without hinderrance of molestation. No.—18. A Rogom for liberty to buy one hundred loads of silk yearly at Ghilaun. No. 19.—A Rogom ordering the English to be treated with respect all over Persia. No. 20.—A Rogom that English may recover their own debts, and the Governor only to interpose, as may desire, or in case the person owing be remote on any part of the Kingdom that then the Governor of the place where he is, send him to the English Chief on his applica tion, and that the Company have the preference; herein he also gives the English liberty to build, or hire a house in any part of his dominions. No. 21.—A Rogom about examining and reporting our affairs to him. No. 22. - A Rogorn for the English house at Spahaun and that the head of the water don't hinder it coming to ont Garden. No. 23.—A Rogom ordering the Governor of Shyrash not to give any trouble to the people that live in the English house. Under these Rogoms whilst the Kingdom of Persia enjoyed a state of tranquility the Company's trade was carried on with success and considerable extent, a ship being annually consigned there from Europe, in addition to w ^ mjIi manv consignments were made from Bombay as will appear by the extracts copied into the Appendix; their sales consisted chiefly in broad cloth and perpets with a small quantity of iron and lead; the returns were in Carmenia wool, copper and specie. About this period the Russian Company obtained an Act of Parliament under which they opened a trade with the Caspian Sea and imported considerable quantiLies of the British manufactures at Resht, which being more convenient for the supply of the northern parts of Persia may have contributed in some measure to the decline of trade at Gombroon which town owed its entire consequence to the English and Dutch houses there established. A principal object of the Russian Company and which probably aided their sales was a return in raw silk, the produce of the province of Ghilaum, whereas the only article of export from Gombroon, was carmenia wool, of which they could not, sometimes with great difficulty, obtain more than 10 or 12,000 pounds weight per annum. Copper they could get from the mines of Diarbeker, but that was only considered as a remittance to India. Under the protection of the Company's Factory at Gombroom, British subjects 'appear to have been entitled to the same privileges of trade on paying a consulage of 2 per cent and customs were also collected on exports. All Persian merchants purchasing good at the factory, paid 2| per cent, to the Government at Gombroon on carrying them out; the Armenian merchants who sent freight on English ships were subject to a duty of 10 and 11 per cent., but in 1742 they were allowed to land the goods at the English factory, and charged only 7 per cent. This was probably only a temporary indulgence for in subsequent years we find the Armenians averse to sending goods to Gombroon from the great impositions they were subject to.437 Prior to this period the Company's servants had experienced oppressions and extortions from the officers of the Persian Government, to which from the great distance and difficulty of access to the Sovereign they were obliged to submit; but in the latter part of the reign of Nadir Shaw they found those evils had a higher source: that monarch intoxicated with his success, could not brook the least shew of opposition to his will; his cruelty and avarice became insatiable, his ferocious guards and Afghan soldiers were let loose upon the peaceable subjects and both they and strangers were beat, plundered and murdered not only with impunity but encouragement from their master. The King who was then at Carmenia granted a Rogom to protect the Company's Banian, brokers, and other servants all over Persian and exempting them from Mustarade and all other impositions, etc., but the ink was scarce dry before he ordered them to be tortured, the factory plundered and forced a bill on Spahaun for 3126,000 from the Resident, who afterwards made hig escape to Gombroon. Exemptions were attempted on the factory at Gombroon, but were fortunately not carried into effect before the tyrant was cut to pieces by his own soldiers. The death of Nadir Shaw was not succeeded by that tranquility which had been expected. Competitors appeared for the throne of Persia, the Nobles took part with these or set up for themselves as suited their immediate interest, or ambition, and a civil war commenced which continued till Carim Caun established his authority over the Kingdom. In tracing the progress of the Company's affairs through those times of anarchy and confusion, we find the situation of their servants and property to have in a precarious situation. On the taking of Ispahaun in 175Q, the Company's house was plundered and their Resident there most cruelly beat, wounded and their servants threatened with death were obliged to make their escape in disguise to Gombroon, which they fortunately effected. The Agent and Council finding themselves continually ill-used by the Government of Gombroon and alarmed at the approach of every chief or body of troops whose course was generally marked by rapine found it expedient to have a ship at anchor in the roads for the purpose of re-embarking the Company's property and themselves whenever it became necessary eo to do, by this prudent management they avoided the threatened danger, and were only under the necessity of making occasional presents. During this period it was frequently in agitation to remove the factory to some of the islands in the Persian Gilph, and those of Bahrein, Kishmish, Ormus, etc., were thought of for that purpose. The information obtained were relative to thess islands, will be found in the appendix ; the principal objection to such a factory may probably have been the danger of thereby sacrificing the privileges enjoyed of exemption from customs and the difficulty of removing the mart, though neither of them seem to have been mentioned,and tlhose then started arose from the expense that would be incurred and the risk that might have been in transporting goods to the Persian shore, which was not more than one day's sail. In consequence of encouragement given by the Sheik of Bundareek, a factory was attempted to be established there in 1755, but before that was accomplished a revolution took place, and his successor drove away the Resident, who had settled there. The insecurity of property throughout Persia and the interruption of merchants met with in transporting goods through the country occasioned a natural decay in the trade, and though in late years we find very considerable sales, this seems to have been made as intervals of tranquillity occurred and constant depreciation not only in the price, but in the quality of goods they purchased, the principal staple article being cloth. It is mentioned in the late Diarys, that those who formerly used fine broad cloth were now reduced to use perpets in most cases from necessity, in some from prudence, to avoid by the appearance of wealth to excite the avarice of those who possessed or for a moment assumed power, in the different provinces ; and latterly money became so scarce that the merchants who arrived from the northern provinces had nothing but precious stones to offer in exchange for merchandize. We have no other data on which to estimate the trade carried on by individuals at Gombroon than the consulage collected, and, this being only from English traders who do not at that time appear to have been numerous, may be a very small proportion indeed of the amount of Indian goods carried to Persia. The Appendix No. 15 shews the greatest collection of consulage to have been Shahees 4,19,339-3, but there is reason to believe in this is enclosed438 what may have been collected at Bussora whieb from want of Gombroon books cannot be ascertained. The amount of 10 Shahees the general exchange is R41933, which sum being only 2 per cent, on the valuation makes the total import 6:20,96,600. Taking it however in the year 1733-1733 when the Gombroon consulage is only stated at Shahees 77,071-9 orR7,707, the import would be E3,85,350 from the accounts of the years 1730—1733 and 1731, 1732 we apprehend some different arrangement has existed as we observe the customs regularly credited for those two years at Shahees 200,000, which has the appearance of their being farmed and the consulage to have been small in proportion thereto. The lowest consulage in 1747-1748, viz., Shahees 34.155 exhibits an import value of Rl,70,775, and it must be remarked that this is the year succeeding the 'death of Nadir Shah and at a time when the atrocities committed by him and his soldiers must have detered the merchants in India from consigning goods to Persia. Taking the average of the 21 years of the consulage at Gombroon and Bussora, it gives Shahees 1,64,187 or R16,418 j this shews an average import on which the consulage has been paid, of fi 8,2 0,9 00. So far as we can judge of the extracts copied into the Appendix, which (from the numbe r of books wanting and the decayed state of those that remain) are very incomplete, the factory it appears subjected the Company to considerable loss. The increase of charges of late years arises, however, from the necessity of a vessel constantly being stationed there, the expense whereof is debited ; the factory and insecurity of the Company's property at that place added to the oppressions they were subject are assigned by the Court of Directors as their reasons for not continuing the factory at Gombroon after it had been taken and plundered by the French, • but remaining entirely at Bussora ; the exceeding unhealthy situation of Gombroon was also a great objection to it, many of the gentlemen sent there not surviving the first year and very few ever returning to the Presidency. The Dutch appear from the earliest records to have been long settled at Gombroon and to have received three or four ships (some of them described large) annually from Batavia laden chiefly with sugar, sugar candy, tin, iron, spices, pepper and sometimes a quality of broad cloth; their privileges seem to have nearly the same with those enjoyed by the Hon'ble Company, but they appear to have been under obligation of furnishing spices to the King's kitchen. With the English they also suffered the oppressions of Nadir Shah and his immediate successors ill they were in the year 1751 induced to abandon the factory. This was, however, only temporary, for in a short time the Governor-General of Batavia sent back the same Chief to re-establish it, and after that a considerable force under the direction of Mr. Kniphausen (who had some time before been driven from Bussora) with which he seized upon and fortified the Island of Carrack. During this period the trade carried on in the Caspian Sea seems to have been increased notwithstanding the traders were subject to oppressions and being plundered. It appears that they were able to sell their cloths at Resht, Organge and other ports at as low a rate as the Company ; and being more conveniently situated for the northern provinces they were print cipally supplied from thence. But it is not improbable that the merchants engaged in this traffic carried the English manufactures merely as a remittance and that their principal object was their returns in raw silk, an article which probably from great distance of Ghilan from Gombroon and the danger of the roads does not appear to have been brought to the last mentioned port, in any considerable quantity. In elucidation of the ancient state of the trade we have deemed it expedient to make copious extracts from the Gombroon diaries and books which are annexed as an Appendix- Some of these may probably be thought too voluminous, but as it is a matter that may hereaftei require reference to ascertain other points than that in immediate contemplation, we thought it would be desirable to collect all the commercial information they contained, though it has unavoidably in some measure delayed the delivery of our report. We have taken the epoch of abandonment of the Gombroon Factory as the conclusion of the ancient state of commerce between Persia and India. After the removal of the Agent and Council to Bussora, the trade was.diverted to a d:'fferent quater, though still a con* siderable part of goods sent there entered Persia by way of Havyza, yet the troubles that439 shortly after broke out in that quarter prevented its being carried at least on the part of the Company to any great extent. In 1763 a factory was established at Bushire under articles of agreement with Sheik Soddoom and confirmed by a Royal grant from Carim Caun but we do not find that any considerable trade was established. Great part of what had been carried on from India immediately with Persia seems to have been transferred to Muskat, which is very conveniently situated for a dep6fc of goods intended for the Grulph when an unsettled state of Government renders it hazardous to risk property in the country. From a judicious encouragement given by Imaum at that port he has brought it to a degree of consequence, it would without that and the above circumstances never have attained. The Imaum himself has now a fleet consisting (it is said) of twelve sail of 500 tons each and upwards, besides a great number of dows and dingeys, etc., which, though many of them are armed he employs occasionally on voyages to different parts of India, and up the Gulph ; ships of different nations carry to this port the merchandize required for the consumption of Persia which is purchased by Muscat merchants, and by them again transported in small vessels or boats to the Persian Shore. The turn that the trade has taken, renders it exceedingly difficult to form an estimate of the quantity of goods now imported into or exported from Persia, or to distinguish them from those of the ports on the Arabian side of the Qulph. The Bombay Custom House book class under one head the trade to Muscat and the two Gulphs which includes and the Red Sea. And as duties are only collected on imports, the export entry does not express either weight or value. No. 17 of the Appendix shews, however, a considerable increase in the imports of the last three years, and which has been occasioned entirely by an increased in the trade to Muskat and the Persian Gulph for the failure from the crop of coffee in those years, presented any considerable imports from Mocha, but this increase was chiefly in the import of copper. The Right Honourable the Governor-General in Council having in ] 789 expressed himself solicitous, to be informed of the state of the trade in the western part of India and the Gulph of Persia and Arabia. Mr. Charles Watkins, the Resident at Bushire, collected a very full and particular account of the import at that place, which we have copies into the Appendix No. 19 * as also the report of the Resident and factor at Bussora, No. 20.t The following general articles seem now to constitute the trade to Muscat and the Persian Gulph. From Surat, Grzerat and Cutch. —Piece goods, coarse, of different colours principally blue dooties and chints, also silk piece goods, cotton, rice, wheat and badjeree. From Bombay. —Broad cloth, long ells, iron, steel, tutinague, coarse China sugar, sugar candy, lepper stick lac indigo, cardamums, cloves turmerick, dry ginger, cassia, nutmegs and mace. From Bengal. Svivax, rice, white and coloured piece goods. From Masuli])atam.~Oh .\VLis, The native merchants report the whole of these articles excepting broad cloth and long ells to be advantageous articles of trade. Aga Mahomed Behebany, Agent of Mehedi Ally Caun, the present Resident at Bushire, has furnished us with an annual estimate of supplies from India to the Persian market and from Persia to India which we have copied into the Appendix No. 21. By this it appears that the annual consumption of Indian articles in Persia amounts to 5133,00,000 and the exports to R9,60,000, including pearl, but omitting copper, which we believe now comes chiefly from Bussora, and respecting which we have given No. 22 Extract of our address from the Bombay Custom Master, containing the best information we have been able to collect on the subject. On the last point, and what we consider the principal one referred, the means of increasing the trade, these we apprehend rest chiefly with the King of Persia, or rather with the 2578 F. D. • Not traceable, f Appendix X.440 state o£ his power and the means he possesses of maintaining perfect tranquillity in his countiy. If he and the persons in power under him treat strangers with kindness and condescension, if in his ports the merchant finds safety, convenience and an entire freedom of the trade if the regulations of those ports are plain, and the inhabitants observe them inviolably, if a facility is given for a recovery of debts, the laws are justly administered, and no grievous exactions laid upon the trade in any part of the kingdom, nothing more is required, the fame thereof will spread through the mercantile class of inhabitants of India, and Persia be immediately supplied with every article of necessity or luxury that the inhabitants require or can afford to purchase and the excess of the produce or manufactures of that country transferred to those parts of the world where they can meet a consumption. No attempts should be made to cramp commerce. The merchant is, by the nature of his transactions, free, he will not send an adventure where he can expect to profit nor venture his property, where he thinks it insecure ; if trade is rendered less beneficial or secure in one quarter he pursues it in another. A Sovereign should avoid being himself concerned in trade, as it would be almost impossible for him to carry it on without the interference of his authority which must discourage the subjects, who, when left to themselves, would pursue it with industry and enrich the country and thereby the Sovereign more than all he could possibly expect from his own adventures. Applying the present principles in the present instance it might be said that nothing was required for the assistance of trade that could be effected by Embassy in contemplation, but this would be presuming, as we have done that the country is perfectly settled an i confidence re-established ; as to the former we can only express hopes that it is so, the last we know is not, nor can it be expected for many years, by those who look back to the history of the last century. An aid to this may, we humbly conceive, be rendered by the establishment of a respect able factory under the privileges formerly obtained, and every 'other exemption to duties that might be consistent therewith at every convenient port in the Gulph, which may be found healthy. Bushire, though in many respects eli^ibl-;, has not good road for large ships ; Bundereek appears to be still worse, and they are both situated higher up to Gulph than, perhaps, necessary. G-ombroon, from what accounts we have seeu of it, appears convenient, but is unfortunately exceedingly unhealthy j whether this arises [from the cUmat9, or some cause that could be removed it has not been in our power to ascertain, though from some passages we have met with in Diaries, we apprehend the former. In establishing a factory, the duties of the person appointed there should be nearly those of a Consul to see the British merchants are not imposed upon by the oJScers of Government, but enjoy all the privileges of the port to their full extent j he should also be vested with authority to prevent their giving offence to the natives and a very principal consideration would be the best mode of recovering debts from each party, for without thi?, trade must in a great measure be carried on with ready money, which would prevent its increase to the extent that might be expected, from a well established credit and a certain facility oE recovering debts. If by this means the trade of Persia should be fairly re-established, the consulage to be collected on merchandize imported, would not probably defray the expenses of the establishment, but if it should not do so, it must be recollected that, this was not the only benefit the Company derived the increase of shipping it will require to carry on the trade and of the consumption it may occasion of articles, most of which must be the produce of some part of their effected in India arc objected of much greater consideration. Whether the Company should themselves carry on the traffic, or leave it entirely to private merchants, is a question that we don't consider as coming before us, or even necessary for the present to be discussed.Ml Bombay Cattle, December 17th, 1799.

Malcolm on the state of the trade between Persia ^ India and suggestions as to the means for improving it, 1800. to. —The E arl of M obnihaton , Goyernor General. Fort William. Mi Lord, I have already acquainted Y our Lordship, of my having been furnished by the Govern ment of Bombay with voluminous Documents relating to the trade of the Persian Gulph. I have since my arrival + perused the Records of the Factory, from the period of its original Establishment. The possession of this information, joined to the circumstance of my having personally visited Muscat, Hormuz, Kishm, Anjam, and Kharruckh, makes me more bold than I should otherwise have been, in offering at some length my sentiments to your Lordship on that part of my mission which more particularly relates to the commerce with the Gulph of Persia. 2. In treating a subject of such extent, I am aware that inexperience will lead me into frequent error, and that, I can add but little x X x X possesses. I, however, feel it my duty to communicate what I am able, confident of meeting with indulgence and that Your Lordship will execuse any fault ... negligence in the execution of the important duties with which I am entrusted. x x x X x and concise, I shall divide it under the following heads : ~ first. A general view of the former Trade of European Nations with the Persian Gulf from its first Establishment till the year 1763 the period at which Gombroon X Second. —View of the present state of the Trade with the Persian Gulph. Third. —The mode by which it appears to me the Hon'ble Company could best improve and promote that Trade, and reasons that occur both on Commercial and political grounds for their adopting this mode. I'ourth. —The Port in the Gulph best situated for a settlement. Piffk.—Th-e probable estimate of Receipts &amp; Disbursements, if such was made. Sixth. —The means most proper to carry this plan, if approved of, into execution. 4. In treating the first part of my subject, vizt A general view of the former Trade of European Nations with the Persian Gulph from its first Establishment till the year 1763 the period at which Gombroon was abandoned, it is not necessary to my ... thereupon to enlarge on the extensive Trade which was carried on by that route between India and Europe before, and for a considerable time after, the discovery of the passage by the Cape of Good Hope. It is sufficient to observe that the existence of that commerce, and the flourishing state of Persia under the Sep Race, and Arabia ... accounts fully for those remains of splendour which are yet seen at every Port &amp; on every Island of the Gulph. A great part of the produce of India no doubt found its vent in this direction and enriched every place x which it passed in its course. 5. The Portuguese taking advantage of this circumstance, seized the Island of Hormuz in 1507, and from it, they extended their X over the whole Gulph and X of all the Trade from India to Persia and Arabia. 6. Their Reign was brilliant but of short duration, it fell from two causes ; first. The rapid improvements in art; which facilitated the ... ... Good Hope, and Completely ... the current of the Trade between India and Europe to a new channel. Second—The gealousy and power of rival European Nations, who not only contended with them for the markets of India, Arabia and Persia, by making settlements in those443 countries, and importing great Supplies of Merchandize, but joined 'vrith the natives of those Kingdoms to attack them. 7. After the ... ... Portuguese from the Gulph in 1622, other European Nations found for a short period their Interest in continuing the Trade with Persia &amp; Arabia, in consequence Bunder Abbasi or Gombroon the former country and Bussorah in the latter became both ports of much celibrity, at which the English, French, and Dutch had each Factories. But occasional hostilities with each other, the weakness of the last monarch of the Sefi Race the usurpation and tyranny of ... and the ... that followed his death together with a new communication which had been opened between Europe &amp; Persia by the Caspian Sea, brought such losses upon European Trader in that quarter, that Gombroon was wholly deserted in 1768 and Bassorah from the weakness and tyranny of the Turkish Government and from the constant disputes of its Rulers with their Persian Neighbours had nearly experienced a similar fate. 8. Such is the outline of the former trade, ... ... ... with the Persian Gulf. Before I quit this part of my subject, it but remains to make a few observations on the Governments with whom that Trade was carried on to show more clearly the cause of its decline. 9. It is impossible any Country can be more happily situated for an extensive and lucrative Trade than Persia, possessing a delightful climate, a productive soil, and a numer ous people. It communicates with India and part of Arabia to the South by the Persian Gulph, and to the North it is connected with Europe by with Candahar, Cabul, and the Southern parts of Tartary, and to the West with the Turkish Empire. 10. Though this nation had no doubt under its former monarchs carried on a great and active Trade, sending its Merchants to Constantinople on the one hand and the farthest confines of Tartary on the other, such exertions were only calculated to give it a comparative prosperity with other States whilst Navigation of that wonderful art which has caused such revolutions in the Globe. Persia made no use. Her Merchants carried on a passive commerce on her shores at the mercy of Strangers, by whom indeed those shores were mostly usurped. 11. The consequence of this was, that as neither Imports or Exports were regular (neither depending on the Country itself), there was no certain demand for the extra produce of the soil, or for the work of the manufacturer. Industry and exertion were checked and the fatal expedient of exporting the specie of the Kingdom in exchange for foreign productions and manufactures, was resorted to, in order to protract the existance of a dying commerce. 12. This was one among many causes that combined to reduce this Monarchy from the superior power and splendour which it once enjoyed to a situation the most weak &amp; impoverished. 13. I have already mentioned that the Arabian Empire under the Caliphs consumed a great proportion of Indian goods. Bussorah and Baghdad were the chief marts of their commerce. These cities suffered a natural decline with the power of their Rulers. 14. The Arabian Inhabitants of the Southern Shore of the Gulph have at x con tributed much to its commerce. The pearls found near Bahrein formed their chief export, and these appear to have always fully balanced their imports of European and Indian commodities. 15. I am not in possession of sufficient Documents to enable me to form a correct judg ment of the former Exports and Imports to and from the Persian Gulf. 16. Of these made by the Hon'ble Company it is sufficient to remark that indepen- dant of Tin, Iron, Lead and Steel, a quantity of Cloth &amp; Perpet met with an annual sale at the Ports of Gombroon and Bussorah, at a rate which would have made the Trade advantageous had not the Company been hourly exposed to the heaviest losses by the repeated extortions &amp; seizures of Persian Rulers, who in their turns, plundered their unprotected Factories. 17. ^n opening the second part of my subject. View of the present Trade with the Persian Gulph, it is necpssary to take a glance at the immediate state of the Government of Persia and Arabia, as from such a view alone, a judgment can be formed of the likelihood of improving the Commercial intercourse with this quarter.4i4A 18. The decline of the Commerce with Persia, from the death of Kerim Khan, till Aga Mahommed Khan Cujjar fixed himself upon the throne, during which short period that King dom had eight Monarchs, is so far from being a matter of surprise, that our wonder is forcibly excited to conceive how any trade at all could be carried on with a nation at so distracted an epoch. The only Factory which the Hon'ble Company attempted to preserve was that of Abusheher, and its Records during- this period are a continued detail of dangers and losses. 19. Since the Establishment of the Cujjar family upon the Throne in the year 1792, Trade has revived in every quarter, and the quiet succession of the Reigning Prince to the Aga Mahommed, was no less a subject of astonishment, than Congratulation, to the inhabitants of Persia, who from so happy a beginning anticipate a continuance of internal Peace under a succession of Princes of this race, the founder of which took effectual measures to prevent a further rivalship in the family of Kerim Khan, all of whom he seized and destroyed. 20. Although the reigning Family are frequently blamed for their severity to Governors of Towns and Provinces, which in such a Grovernment must always occasion oppression of the poor, they have been remarkable ever since they enjoyed power for the protection and encourage ment which they have given to Trade in every quarter of their Dominions ; nor is there one instance of injustice towards a Merchant from the accession of Aga Mahommed Cujjar to the present day. The happy effects of this Conduct, if steadily pursued, will soon appear. Strangers will frequent the country, commerce will revive, industry be excited and Persia will again become a prosperous Nation. 21. In speaking of Arabia I will confine myself to those parts of it, which are imme diately connected with nfy subject, these are the cities Baghdad and Bussorah, the Southern Shore of the Persian Grulph and the Province of Oman. 22. Baghdad stands on the banks of a fine river, which carries its Trade to Persia, India- and eastern parts of Arabia by the Persian Gulph, and hj the same'channel—it imports the produce of those countries ; it is also from its situation the natural Emporium of all inland Trade between Persia and Turkey. 23. Bussorah, though a dependency, may well be termed the support of Baghdad. It stands in Arabia Deserta, 70 miles from the Persian Gulph, on the Western bank of that noble river which is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Commerce from India to Baghdad, and between the former and a great part of the Turkish Empire necessarily passes through this city. 24. I have already observed Bussorah was a Port where several European Nations established factories, when Gombroon was abandoned : it became then the chief, and indeed for a period the only, establishment of the English in this quarter. Amongst other causes which accelerated its decline, the principal was the dreadful plague which in the year 1773 desolated both it and Baghdad. 25. Within these few years however, these Cities have recovered in a considerable degree but more particularly the latter, which circumstances is cheafly ascribed to the wisdom and justice of Soliman Bashaw, a Prince, with whose character and relation to the Ottomon Porte, Your Lordship is fully acquainted. 26. The Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulph is under the rule of different Shaikhs ; the principal of whom are those of Graine, and Rasul Khima. The power of the former whose name is Shaikh Abdullah Bin Sabah, extends over Graine, Bahrien, Citiff, and Zubara, the tribe of which he is the chief are termed Riny Attayba more commonly called Uttoobees. They cany on a considerable Trade with Bussorah, Muscat, Surat, and the Coast of Malabar. 27. The Chief Rasul Khima whose name is Shaikh Suker, governs a tribe called Jonassin and his territory lies near Cape Mossuldom. He has about fifty small vessels, a few of which he employs m Trade, but the greater number in piracy ; these have recently been very active, and but too successful in intercepting the Trade of the Gulph. 28. The capital of Oman is Muscat, where the Imame resides. This place is well situated for a mart between the Red Sea and Persian Gulph, and since the decline of Gombroon it has been so also for a great proportion of the commerce carried on between the Gidph and India an advantage for which it is chiefly indebted to the activity and justice of its Rulers.445 29. Your Lordship is fully acquainted with the Trade which the Hon'ble Company carry on at present to the Ports of Bussorah &amp; Abu Sheher. The consumption of woollens is comparatively trifling, and the prices low. The advantages which the recent exertions of the Resident Mehdi Ali Khan have occasioned in this branch of Commerce at Abu Sheher may raise hopes of much profit in future sales, but these from the information I have been yet able to collect should not be too sanguinely indulged. 30. A probable estimate of the property annually employed in Imports &amp; Exports to &amp; fiom the Persian Grulph, makes it amount to the gross sum of one crore &amp; sixty lacks of rupees. I shall endeavour to show as concisely &amp; as correctly as I can the nature of this Com merce &amp; the channels through which it flows. The annual imports to Persia from India amount to above twenty lacks of rupees. They consist of Chintzes from the Coast of Coromandel, Musslins, piece goods, Sugar, &amp; a variety of articles from Bengal, Chinaware Sugarcandy, Camphor, and Ca from Bombay ; Blackpepper, Ginger, Turmeric, Cardamums and Wood for building vessels from the Corut of Malabar, Apiece goods, kamkhaps &amp;ca., feca., from Surat, Cambay, and Gruzarat. From the Red Sea the only Import to Persia is Coffee, and of that, not above twenty thousand rupees is consumed during the year. Persia answers this Trade by an export of about twelve lacks in the native productions of the Country, Silk, Carmenia Wool, Carpets, Tobacco, dried fruit, Asafcetida, Rose water, &amp;ca., &amp;ca., &amp; the balance is sent in Specie and bullion. 31. The Trade with India is chiefly confined to Abu Sheher. The duties collected on Imports &amp; Exports at this Port are regulated by a standard established many years by Shaikh Nasser, father of the present Governor. On Exports they are very trifling, &amp; on goods imported, though nominally more, do not average above 4 per. cent, on the prime Cost, and I have learned from good authority, that the Duties on Imports produced last year seventy thousand rupees, or one lack of Piastres, which gives an import of goods to the amount of seventeen lacks &amp; a half of rupees at this Port alone, independent of the Hon'ble Company's sales, in all of which, the Shaikh receives four per r cent, from the purchaser. This Estimate if correct, which I have reason to believe it is, proves that the present Trade between India &amp; Porsia is rather under, than over, rated. 32. The only Indian Goods that are shipped direct for a Persian Port are those from Bengal, &amp; Masulipatam &amp; the remainder which amount to more than half of the total sum, go first to Muscat, from whence they are re-shipped for the Gulph ,• within these last two years however, the Abu Sheher and Merchants have sent their Agents to Bombay with a view of procuring consignments direct. 33. The Trade from India to Arabia is still more considerable ; it amounts to the annual Sum of at least forty lacks of rupees, thirty of which goes to Bussorah, and the remainder to Bahrien and the Southern Shore of the Gulph; it consists of nearly the same Articles which I have already enumerated as Imports to Persia upwards of twenty five lacks of rupees of this branch of Trade, comes through Muscat, &amp; the whole of the annual Import of Coffee from the Red Sea to Bussorah &amp; the Arabian Shore which is estimated at twenty Lacks is brought by that Port as its natural Emporium. 34. These great imports are answered by Exports from Bussorah of Dates, the Native produce of the Soil by Pearls (received from Bahrien, &amp; other Parts on the Arabian Shore in exchange for Grain) &amp; Gold &amp; Silver Lace brought from Europe by the Aleppo • Caravans &amp; Copper from the mines of Diabeker. Most of these Exports pass through Muscat in their way to India. 35. The balance of Trade Bussorah which generally exceeds ten lacks of rupees is sent in specie &amp; bullion. 36. The value of ten lacks of Indian Goods are annually imported at Bahrien and the adjacent parts of the Arabian Shore, these are balanced by an export of Pearls to an equal amount. 37. Most of the Trade with this quarter, as I have before mentioned, passes ihrough Muscat, but when the Sultaun of that Port is at War with any of the Arab tribes which its not unfrequently the case, it finds a more circuitous route' by the Ports of Abu Sheher &amp; Bussorah.446 38. From the general statement it appears that Muscat is at present the great Emporium of the Trade carried on between the Grulph, the Red Sea &amp; India, At that Port a Duty of 6 or 61 per cent, is taken on Imports, but the amount of this Collection, would even, though correctly known, be far from affording a standard on which a just estimate could be formed of the Commerce of a place where the Prince who pays no duties, is the principal Merchant, &amp; ail his Ministers and favourite officers have exclusive privileges. 39. Upon the grounds I have already stated, I should calculate that Muscat is indepen dent of its own internal consumption, the medium of an annual trade of one Crore of rupees, &amp; when we further consider that most of this is freighted on Vessels belonging to that Port, we are at a loss to account for its present prosperity. 40. I now come to the third Division of my subject, viz. The mode by which it appears to me the Hon^ble Company could best improve and promote that Trade, and reasons that occur both on Commercial, and political«grounds for their adopting this mode. 41. It is unnecessary for me to remark to Your Lordship, that the Hon ; ble continuing their Trade with Persia on the same footing on which it has hitherto been carried on, can promise no solid or permanent advantage. 42. The State of Persia since the first establishment of this Commerce to the present day has been at once weak, &amp; divided, &amp; the transient appearances of settlement which it has at times assumed, from the success or vigour of a temporary ruler, though events of a nature- to encourage the speculations of private Merchants never appear to have merited the attention of the first Commercial body in the World, and must have become less an object as the Hon^ble Company increased in power. If in a Country like this, the acts of one Prince could be binding on anotherif, in short there had been any Government, there were sufficient Firmans bestowing, &amp; confirming privileges granted to the Factories at Gombroon and Abu Sheher to have rendered them the most favored and flourishing settlements that ever were established on a foreign Shore. But these Firmans which were generally obtained at a consi derable expence, were little better than waste Paper, and seem in no instance than I can discover on the Records of either of the Factories, to have saved them, or their Agent employed inland from the violence of the Government, or the extortion of its Officers. Unless as they were, it was always thought expedient to renew them, and further expence was incurred ; this added to occasional sums which necessity obliged the Residents to give in presents to the Governors of Towns, &amp;ea., and the expence of Vessels kept at Ports for the safety of the Company's Servants when threatened with attack, form an amount that must have more than twice consumed the profits of the most advantageous Trade. 43. It is impossible in my opinion that any Commercial Agreement formed with the present King of Persia can be an object (whatever other specious advantages it may offer) the Hon'ble Company &amp; their subjcet s ... as at present with stability and good faith of this Government. 44. The Commerce with Arabia stands on nearly similar grounds, &amp; if the Trade with the Gulph of Persia be desireable, which it no doubt is, it should so far as I am able to judge be put upon a footing that will command the respect of the nations with whom it is carried on. To do this, it appears to me indispensible that the Hon'ble Company should have an establishment of strength at some Convenient Port, where they could concentrate the Commerce to the Gulph, and give efficient protection not only to their own Factories, but to their numerous Indian subjects, among whom it is of ultimate consequence, to excite a liberal spirit of commercial enterprize &amp; adventure, and it is a sense of the important benefits that must arise * to the State from a general diffusion of this spirit, that would make me recommend the Trade of all Indian Goods being left open to Individuals, although I am convinced there are several Articles, particularly Chintz, Spices, &amp; Sugar from an extensive trafic in which, considerable immediate profit might arise to the Government. This Commerce in the hands of private Merchants, will be more brisk, &amp; exclusive, &amp; their industry &amp; exertions will ultimately tend more to the increase of the Hon'ble Company's Revenues &amp; to advance the prosperity of that great Empire of which they are Sovereigns. 45. I shall here shortly enumerate the most obvious reasons that occur on Commercial grounds to recommend establishing a respectable Settlement. It appears a matter of some447 importance that the Company should increase the sale of Woollens 8c other staples, I observe in all the letters from the Court of Directors that they are more anxious the sales should be extensive, than profitable. I am inclined to suppose from eveiy account I have received that if the Woollens were sold ... Port in the Gulph for the price paid at Bombay, which I shall have occasion to show they might be without loss, that the annual Consumption in Persia alone, would be twelve or fourteen hundred Bales of purpetts (of 10 pieces in each Bale) and from six to eight hundred Bales of Broad Cloth &amp; long Ells. 46. Of the probable consumption at Bussorah, I cannot speak, but to judge from a joint Report given by Mr. Manesty and Mr. Jones in 1790, on the Trade of Arabia &amp; Persia, many reasons combine against its ever being very considerable. 47. Of the other staples. Iron to the amount of twelve thousand, lead two thousand, steel one thousand, and of white lead five thousand Bombay maunds might, if my information is correct, be annually sold at an advantageous rate in Persia, &amp; a small quantity of the latter Articles would also it appears from Messrs. Manesty &amp; Jones's Report meet a profitable sale at Bussorah. 48. During all the Revolutions that have afflicted Persia, the demand for these staples has been almost always at an average, and if the Native Merchants had an easy access to a well supplied English Port in the Gulph which from its strength was perfectly independant of the Persian Monarchy. The changes of the Government &amp; the despotism of the reigning Prince would have but little effect on the sales. 49. The Hon'ble the Court of Directors have at different periods expressed a strong desire to make purchases of Carmenia Wool, an article which has within late Years become very scarce from two causes. First, the Uncertainty of its sale to European Traders, &amp; Second, its expenditure in the external Manufactures of the Country which have increased to a great extent since supplies from abroad became precarious. The establishing a good &amp; permanent market for this Valuable Commodity would encourage the Natives of Carmenia to attend to *their Goats, would diminish the manufactures at home, &amp; consequently raise tha demand for those from abroad. 50. It must always be the interest as well as the duty of a Government to increase the industry &amp; wealth of a Country under its rule ; and there is no way in which this can be so well done, as by providing secure &amp; ready means of removing to a good market the extra produce of the soil, &amp; the work of the manufacturer. The prosperity of the Country will ever keep an exact ratio with the extent of such means. If the justness of this principle is admitted ; is it not most essential that the Hon'ble Company should provide a safe mart for a Trade which (since their acquisition of the Coast of Malabar) consumes the amount of near fifty lacks of rupees annually of the extra produce of their provinces, and which, if encouraged, &amp; efficiently protected would in all probability increase to a double amount. 51. Independant of answering this essential and a respectable Establishment of the nature proposed would be the best means of securing to the Hon'ble Company the Trade of the Gulph in the event of that ever becoming from changes either in the Persian or Turkish Empire an object to other European Powers. 52. Though the original expence of the undertaking with the Current Disbursements for an Establishment would no doubt exceed any immediate profit that would be expected from the adoption of this plan, I cannot have a doubt but that even,in a Commercial point of view this settlement would become in the course of a few years a source of advantage, instead of loss to the Hon'ble Company. 53. I shall next proceed to state such reasons as occur on political grounds to recommend the adoption of this measure, &amp; I have 1 no hesitation in confessing, that x to me of a nature, so important, as to supersede all Commercial considerations whatever on this point. 54. It cannot be expected that the different Nations of Europe can ever view without envy, England enjoying almost exclusively the Commerce of the East, and it is to be supposed4)48 they will in their turns as they possess the means endeavor to obtain a share in that great source of wealth and power. The superiority of the Navy of Great Britain, places at a distance any attempt against the possessions of that nation in India by an Armament that has to double the Cape of Good Hope. The Red Sea, and Persian Gulph, therefore, are the only Channels by which such an attack could be made, and though but little probability of success could attend such attempts, the possibility can admit of no doubt, &amp; therefore, every means of defence should be provided. The descent of the French in Egypt has lately occasioned considerable alarm, and if they could settle themselves in the peaceable possession of that Country, no doubt every danger might be apprehended from their future progress whether under a monarchical, or republican form of Government. The facility with which they con quered Egypt, &amp; the wretched exertions that have been made by the Turks to expel them from that Country, shew in a very forcible point of view, the weak &amp; declining state of the Ottomon power, and what little dependance is to be placed on that Government as a barrier between India &amp; Europe. 55. The difficulty and danger of the Navigation of the Red Sea, the prevailing Southerly winds which blow near nine months in the year up that Gulph; the inhospitality of its shores the heat of the Climate, &amp; the scarcity of fresh water, are ever likely to prove strong objec tions to any European power attempting an attack on India by that Quarter. Though the approach is more difficult, a very different prospect invites them to the Persian Gulph, two navigable rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, which when once reached, would afford them a plentiful present x and facilitate their future progress. In the Gulph itself are numerous Islands, and both its shores abound in supplies, the navigation is safe, the Voyage to &amp; from India practicable at all seasons, &amp; the temperature of the Climate adapted to the European constitution. To a powerful Nation that proceeded on a steady system of aggrandize ment, this would undoubtedly be the route. Baghdad and Bussorah would be, if once reached easy Conquests, &amp; these Cities &amp; their surrounding provinces would be, settled before further progress was attempted. If such event ever occurred, the Sublime Porte perplexed by its European possessions, could find little support to these distant nominal dependancies. 56. There are only two quarters from which such an attack would seem possible. An Army from France or any Southern State in Europe might be disembarked at Latichea in the Mediterranam and reach Aleppo in four days. At that City they would be able from every account to obtain the most plentiful supplies. In three days more they would reach the Euphrates, and a march of about 300 miles mostly along its banks would bring them to near r€o o rl 57. The other quarter is from the Caspian, the navigation of which is completery commanded by Russia and that great Northern Power has the full means of making vast equipments m this quarter ; to a progress in which many circumstances prove the attention of the late Empress was seriously turned. At herideath an Army of thirty thousand men that had advanced within a fiew marches of Tabriz to act against Aga Muhammad Khan were x Persia x 58. If ever Russia attacked either the Persian or Turkish Empire on this side of Asia they would probably be joined by the Georgians and Armenians both of which Tribes have withm late Years repeatedly imployed their protection against their intolerant Mahom- madans neighbours. 59. What I have advanced relative to the future possible attempts of 4,600 European Nations is only conjectural, but if there appears after due reflection, tiie least probability o any of those advancing in this quarter, it certainly becomes an object of immediate importance to the Hon'ble Company to form a settlement in the Gnlph calculated in - 6 . S 1 ^ 8t ^ ce to com mand the Trade, and in the second, to become an obstacle of magnitude to the nearer approach to India of any power whatever. 60. Nothing could tend in so decisive a manner to establish the political influence of the on e Company on a firm &amp; respectable footing with the Kingdom of Persia &amp; those par o ra la or enng on the Gulph, as there having a Settlement of the nature proposed.449 It would give them the complete command of the Commerce, &amp; they would be able to place every trust in the friendship of Nations who could not become Enemies without sacrificing the Trade on which their prosperity depended. But to make this important effect which would be the immediate consequence of such an establishment more clear, 1 shall proceed to examine it as it relates separately to each of the States concerned. 61. To begin with Persia I have not a moment's hesitation in affirming my belief that the instant an English Settlement of strength was formed, every Merchant of that country, that trades with India would either settle himself, or keep an Agent with the Chief part of his property at it. They all have the fullest confidence in the protection which the Company's Government affords to Persons &amp; property. None of them have any in that of their own. At Muscat they are not without apprehension, the security of that Port depending on the life &amp; characters of individual Princes could never long rival a settlement of equal or more consequence under the Stable Governmt. of the Hon'ble Company. 62. Should the principal Merchants of Persia be settled themselves, or have most of their concerns at such a Port, the consequence would be their using every endeavor to promote the Commerce &amp; friendship between the two Nations ; or in other words to forward their own Interests, and their exertions would hardly fail of success, as the merchants in Persia who are the only monied men in that Kingdom are remarkable for the great political influence they have maintained through all the changes &amp; revolutions of their distracted Govern ment. 63. When we join to this consideration that the Company would be enabled from such a measure to stop at a moment the importation of any articles whatever from India to Persia &amp; to deprive the latter K ingdom not only of many of the luxuries, but also some of the neces saries of life (for such Sugar in particular has become) we may conclude that a certain reliance might be placed upon the continuance of the Friendship of that Country, &amp; if the English Government could not oblige it to take an active part against its Enemies, whoever these might be, there would be no fear of its ever joining or aiding them. 64. With respect to Bussorah and Baghdad these arguments are still more forcible because their Imports and Exports are larger, &amp; they are more immediately dependant on the Trade with India &amp; the Bed* Sea for their very existence. The intercepting of the Coffee Elect alone from the latter would occasion a distress in those Cities &amp; neighbouring Turkey Plant of which, X but one well acquainted with the excess to which that favourit is used could form a conception. 66. The control which the Settlement proposed would give the English Government over their Trade, is the best secured, that can be taken for the friendly behaviour of so weak &amp; unprincipled a Government as the Turkish, &amp; it would probably induce the Bashan of Baghdad, in the event of the interests of the Court of Great Britain &amp; the Ottoman, Porte ever being separated, to take a very determined line in favor of the former. 66. The Arabs of the Southern Shore of the Gulph are too contemptible to be Enemies, &amp; as they would meet a good mart for their Commerce, &amp; their craft (as I will have occasion to show hereafter) would have increased employment in the navigation of the Gulph they would soon become the natural friends of the English Government. 67. Muscat would be the only State of which the future prosperity would be affected by this arrangement, but the effects of this change would be too gradual to draw the serious consideration of its ruler, who is more employed in devising means of present advantage than informing plans for the future aggrandizement of his successors. His own vessels, and those of his subjects would continue to carry on as extended a commerce as before ; &amp; should he aid the English Government in the accomplishment of this plan, which he may perhaps have the power to do, an extended privilege of exporting Rock Salt to Bengal, would fully remunerate any loss of duties that might take place during his Reign. He is already pledged by Treaty to give his assent to the Company's building a Eort at Gombroon if they chuse and he is too wise to oppose any design they may form of making an establishment in the Gulph, as he well knows his com-450 parative weakness &amp; is fully sensible that an order to admit no Arab vessels into Company 's Ports would x ruin and that of his Government. 68. I come now to the consideration of the 4th Division of my subject^ vizi., The Port in the Gulph best situated for a settlement. 69. To answer all the ends, Commercial and political, which I have already suggested, it would be necessary that the Port at which the English Government established such settlement should posssess the following advantages :— ht.—An excellent Harbour well protected from all weather, but particularly from the South-East and Sorth-West winds, which prevail in the Gulph, &amp; often blow with extreme violence. 2nd. —A healthy climate, good water, sheep and cattle in its vicinity, or at least a soil on which such could be fed. 8rd.—A situation that vessels to and from the Gulph could touch at, without any loss of time, in order that it might become the Emporium of the Trade, and lastly it ought to be so situated that no vessel whatever could enter or go out of the Gulph, without being distinctly seen from it, in order that it might completely command the Trade. 70. Unless a Port combined all these advantages, and was also from situation capable to being rendered perfectly independant of the Arab &amp; Persian Governments, it would not in my opinion be an object for the Hon'ble Company to form any settlement that involved much expence, &amp; from past experience, I should imagine any feebler efforts to increase &amp; protest the Commerce of the Gulf to be more likely to terminate in danger and loss than in the production of solid &amp; permanent benefit. 71. The Ports in the Gulph which from their former celebrity or present resort merit any attention are those of Gombroon &amp; Abu Sheher, on the Continent of Persia, and the Islands of Bahrien, and Khamukh, Hormuz, x Kishm &amp; Anjam- 72 I shall begin by stating the distinct advantages which each of those places possesses, next mention the objections that may be advanced against them and conclude with my opinion of the Port best calculated for settlement, and* a statement of the reasons on which such opinion is grounded. 73. Of the Ports of Gombroon &amp; Abu Sheher, I consider former by far the most favourable situation for most of the purposes that I have laid down as in responsible requisities for an English Settlement. It has the best harbour for large Vessels, &amp; is better situated in every respect to command &amp; become the medium of the Trade in the Gulph Abu Sheher is only preferable as possessing a more healthy climate, and being nearer to Shiraz and the other chief marts of Indian Commerce; but it appears to me that these are almost insuperable objections to these or any other Ports that are situated on the continent. In the first instance it would probably be a matter of much difficulty to obtain permission for erecting a fort and town of any respectability on the main land. In the next it would require such to be of very considerable strength to resist the attacks that might be expected on a mercantile town within the easy reach of a Persian Army ; and, lastly, a settlement so placed would be likely to involve the Hon'ble Company in the interior interests of the Persian kingdom, any concern with which I should conceive it would always be better to avoid. 74. The Island of Bahrien though undoubtedly one of the finest in the Gulf is from situation perfectly unadopted for the settlement, not one of the great purposes of which it could answer. It is at present crowded with inhabitants, and is, as I have before stated, subject to the Shaikh of Graine. 75. Karrack has a good climate, excellent water and command the Bussorah Eiver It might be converted here that if policy demanded an extent of this into an essential, subordinate, but never could be the chief settlement. It has no safe harbour j it doss not command the trade between India and Persia, nor could it ever become a Emporium ofconsequence, as tlie voyage even to Bussorah is reckoned nearly over, when a vessel reaches this island. 76. Hormuz is not unfavourably situated, it has the advantage of a good harbour, and while Gombroon flourished was the likeliest island in the Gulph to reach the summit of prosperity which it attained under the Portuguese. This chiefly arose from the strength of its fortifications which offered a safe asylum to merchants of all descriptions on the shores of a great and luxurious Government, which, though it afforded hopes of ample profit, gave no permanent security to the trader, who gladly resorted to almost where he incurred no risque of being plundered, and where his gains were equally certain. This remark applies more forcibly when we consider the fate of the island, which the, moment it ceased to be in the possession of an European Nation, declined into that State of insignificance from which nothing but the combined efforts of justice and industry could ever have raised it. The Imam of Muscat four years ago took possession of this island, which he found almost entirely deserted. That active Prince has repaired the old Portuguese Fort in a tolerable manner, and settled about fifty families upon it, for whom he has built comfortable dwellings. Nothing vegetable i s produced on this island, nor is there any water, but what is preserved in vaulted reservoirs ^hat are filled in the rainy season. It abounds in salt of which the soil is chiefly composed and that article might be exported in any quantity. The objections to Hormuz are the scarcity of fresh x being at least one day's vail out of v the X for vessels going up and down the Gulph x also from its want of vegetation be subject to extreme heats in summer, though it has always been reputed healthy. 77. The island of Sarack is still better situated than Hormuz being more to the south ward, and consequently nearer the direct track. This advantage, however, is more than counterbalanced by its want of a Harbour, which added to its being very destitute of both water and vegetations, makes it a place entitled to little consideration. Not having visited i^ I cannot speak more particularly, but what I have said, is from the best information I could collect in its vicinity, which joined to the circumstance of its never having been a place of great resort, makes me conclude that it is not adopted for the settlement proposed. 78. Kishma or as it is more properly called Jezire derauze is the largest island in the Gulph. Its eastern extreme is within five miles of Hormuz nearly opposite Gombroon or Bunder Abbas. It runs upwards of fifty miles north-west parallel with the Persian shore, and is no place twelve miles broad.f This island which is divided from the continent by a channel that is navigable for the longest ships, had formerly 300 villages upon it, not above one hundred and fifty of which now remain. The inhabitants appear to be a quiet unoffensive race, who exist chiefly by fishing and cultivation, and the soil produces sufficient dates, wheat and barley for their consumption. They also breed cattle and sheep, and the latter are said to thrive uncommonly in this island. Kishma paid formerly a Rent of above Us. 5,000 annually to the Persian Government. At present it is under the independent rule of a Shaikh named M oulla Hussen who has, however, within these two months agreed to pay homage to the Imame of Muscat. The Shaikh who resides at the fort of Kishma, the capital, which X on the north-east extremity of the island, has x whatever and is unable to protect his subjects who are constantly exposed to the desultory attacks of the Arabs of the Jonassen tribe who possess the opposite coast of Arabia. This island has several Harbours, that at the Town of Kishma is far from being either very convenient or safe. The principal one on the north side of the island is that of Suft, which is represented by every native I examined as one of the best in the Gulph. On the south is that formed by the island of Anjur or An jam, which form its excellence, as well as most admirable situation. I should recommend above all others as that where the Hon'ble Company should establish a settlement. This Harbour is so completely hand-locked by the two Islands, which are not above three miles distant from each other, that a vessel can anchor close to either shore at all seasons, and there is sufficient depth of water to allow of a line of battle ship lying within half a mile and small craft within a hundred yards of the land. The navigation requires no pilot, a vessel of the largest burthen can always go out or come in with the greatest facility. Indeed any ship going up or down the Gulph with a fair wind, will not lose one hour by going through this harbour, and no vessel can well avoid coming close to it as the Arabian shore is within a tihort distance and can be seen clearly with the naked eye, and the Salamahs or coins as452 termed by Europeans wliicli lye off Cape Mossuldom bear but a few leagues to tlie south-east of it. 79. Had I found the small island of Anjam, whicli was formerly inhabited possessed any of those requisities which would contribute to the maintenance of a flourishing settlement. Had it in short that either sufficient soil or water, I would certainly give it a preference to Kishma, on account of its more convenient size, from which it would be better defended by fewer men, but the X extent of Kishma is an objection, and has x formerly urged as such by the Court of Directors, it is far from being a serious one at the present period is attentively examined. A grant of the whole island would certainly be necessary, Jaut the Hon'ble Company might take possession of such port only in the vicinity of their settle ment as they chuse. Should they, however, take the whole as policy might, perhaps, require a very small part in the present Fort at the Capital on the north-east extremity, and another at the part of Luft nearly opposite to the harbour at Anjam, together with their principal garrison in the fort to be erected on the shore near that port would not only keep the in habitants themselves in perfect order, but also prevent any attempts of neighbouring Arabs to plunder, and this latter evil would be further guarded against by two Cruizers being constantly stationed at this harbour, an arrangement which I shall have occasion to shew might be made without either expence or inconvenience to Government. 80. Considerable changes have taken place both in India, &amp; the Gulph since the Court of Directors refused to attend to the repeated Solicitations of their Servants at Gombroon to make a settlement on the Island of Kishma. 81. The small Arab craft that were at that period almost wholly employed in acts of piracy find now more permanent advantages in navigating the Sea as fair Traders. The Imame of Muscat has within these few years punished severely those Rovers who continued to infest the Gulphs, &amp; is now carrying on a successful War with the Shaikh of Ras ul Khima, the only formidable pirate that remains. 82. There is now hardly a possibility of what at that period was extremely probable that any Settlement formed in the Persian Gulph by the English would have been liable to an attack from the French or other European Nation in the event of a War. Under such idea al large Island was no doubt unfavourable for a Settlement particularly as it was hoped that the Persians in case of a rupture X have been able by the aid of an European power to have transported &amp; subsisted their Army upon it whilst carrying on the attack of its Forts. But as such changes have now occurred may it not be urged with much plausibility that it is an advantage to settle on an Island like Kishma able to maintain itself independant of the Con tinent, and capable also of being improved to a great degree. That it has abundance of Water &amp; a good soil, I learn from the Inhabitants themselves &amp; their numbers with the large planta tions of Date Trees and grain sufficiently confirm their evidence. I had not leisure to go on shore from the Frigate when lying in the Harbour between it &amp; Anjam but three small villages situated near the beach, within a mile of each other &amp; some plantations of date Trees, convinced me that there would be no difficulty in fixing on a spot that would answer for a settlement. Of the healthiness of the climate I can of course speak only from the Information of others. I was told by those I asked that the air was more salubrious and temperate at all Seasons than that of Hormuz or Gombroon. Among my Informants were several natives, &amp; their appearances fully corroborated their assertions. I shall here add some advantages which this Port appears to possess some situation above all others in the Gulph, particularly those which would have a direct tendency to make it the Emporium between India, Persia &amp; Arabia. 83. The Harbour between Kishma &amp; Anjam is at most seasons of the year, as X a run from Bombay, as Muscat, &amp; indeed when the difficulty of getting into Muscat x &amp; the favourable winds which vessels generally secure by keeping to the northwind, &amp; close in with the shore is considered.. The Voyage I am inclined to believe will be performed sooner &amp; certainly with much more ease &amp; confidence by the ships x and small Craft of Natives who fear x out of sight of land. It is to be far X considered that when Goods from Bombay reach Muscat, they have to perform a voyage of at least lour, &amp; pro bably six, days in the most favourable Season before they reach the length of this Port in their *453 passage up tlie Gulph. When we add to the circumstance that the collections of this settle ment would not probably be above one-half of that of Muscat, &amp; the confidence of the Merchants for obvious reasons tenfold, we cannot hesitate in concluding that this Port would immediately x the x commerce between the Gulph &amp; Bombay, which has hitherto been earned to Muscat. The trade with the Coast of Malabar would formerly similar reasons soon find the same channels as well as that from the Coast of Coromandel and Bengal. This change might in some Articles be more slow than in others from the Muscat Merchants being at present the Chief Traders, &amp; their Vessels being mostly employed in freight, but it is impossible they could long support a competition with other Merchants &amp; Ship owner who conveyed their goods at less expence &amp; navigated their Vessels by a less circuitous track. This remark applies most pointedly to that Considerable Trade which I have stated to be carried on between Surat, Cambay &amp; Guzerat with the Gulph which could not but find its mart in the Port proposed. 84. next to be examined x x x x xxx become the Emporium of the Trade that is now carreid on direct from Calcutta &amp; the Coasts of Coromandel and Malabar with the higher Ports in the Gulph, such as Abu Sheher and Bussorah. 85. It occurs here to remark that the situation of this Harbour a few miles within the Gulph is such that x Craft of the Arabian &amp; Persian Shores x go to &amp; from it &amp; their respective Ports at all Seasons of the Year with perfect safety &amp; ease. These Crafts in which goods are freighted for a third of the sum that they are on European xx x vessels which it is necessary to employ in long voyages would be continually sent to this Port for goods, &amp; be exclusively employed in the interior Navigation of the Gulph. No Circumstance would be more favourable to the Ports of Abu Sheher, &amp; Bussorah, and also the Arabs on the Shores of the x x the latter would have an increased x x Craft &amp; the Merchants of the former would after paying a small Consulage or duty on the landing of their goods at the Port of Kishma save considerably in the freight without having any additional resque whatever. x To throw this into a stronger point of view it is only necessary to remark that the freight from Bombay to the Port proposed could not from the distance &amp; nature of the navigation, be more than half of what it is to Abu Sheher &amp; little more than one-third of that to Bussorah. 86. Whatever Trade from India made this Port its Emporium to the Gulph the return would for similar reasons make it so also. 87. The Commerce between the Red Sea &amp; the Gulph would unless some very impor tant change took place continue to centre as usual at Muscat, though it merits notice that that Port is neither in facility of X X , to be Harbour between Kishm &amp; Anjam. X 88. Another advantage that would attend this Harbour from its being in the direct tract of the Cruizers to Bussorah, would be, that two of these vessels could be constantly stationed at it, &amp; x add greatly to its strength and respectability • x without any inconvenience or expence x as they might be always kept ready for x at a moment's warning &amp; regularly relieve the Cruizers that come from Bombay &amp; Bussorah with Packets, and in the event of one or both being employed against Arab pirates, the Cruizers that come direct at such a period, might proceed the whole Voyage as at present. 89. Each of these Cruizers might also bring a proportion of the Hon'ble Company's staples, &amp; on a calculation the whole annual Supplies might with ease be conveyed m this manner which would obviate any expence x x _ , being sold at the same rate as they X x 0111 ^ a circumstaDce that would, as I have before stated, considerably increase the consumption, 90. In concluding this part of my subject, it is necessary ' k that I should inform your Lordship, that I have formed my opinions of the Comparative excellence of the different harbours, of the probable periods of voyages, and other matters that refer to nautical affairs454 alfnost entirely on the judgment of Captain Selby, an officer of much experience, who Commanded the Bombay Frigate. 91. I now proceed to the fifth Division of my subject. The probable estimate of Receipts and Disbursements if such was made, in examining which, I cannot be expected to make any but the most general Calculations. 92. x suppose a Resident x sufficient for the Civil Gov ernment of this Settlement, for whom, &amp; a Surgeon a monthly Salary of four thousand rupees would provide liberally &amp; include all charges. I have estimated the Salaries high, because x judge it of ultimate consequence, x to the prosperity, but the existance x settlement of this kind, that the Resident &amp; those under him should be debared from all other advantages, &amp; particularly from Trade under any shape whatever. Obvious reasons point out the necessity of this regulation. 93. The military would be Sepoys, with a small Detachment of Artillery including which, &amp; their officers they should amount to five hundred men. The monthly expence of snch an Establishment may be liberally estimated at 10,000 Rs. to which 1,000 more may be added as x repairs of arms &amp;ca. x this makes the total amount of current charges 15,000 pr. month, or 1,00,000 Rs. pr. annum; to which 20,000 may be added for keeping the fortifications, buildings, &amp;ca. in repair which would increase the current expences to two lacks of Rs. annually. 94. The original expence would, no doubt, be considerable, but I should imagine that building a Fort for the protection of the Town &amp; harbour, with the erection of one or two small Ports which it might be necessary to occupy, the building of Houses for the Civil officers, &amp; quarters for the Soldiers, would not altogether exceed the Sum of three lacks of Rupees. It is to be recollected, that in proportion to the respectability &amp; strength of the Establishment, so will be the resort to it &amp; consequent future advantage. 95. Though I have before said that the Island of Kishma produced to the Persian Government about five thousand rupees, &amp; though I have no doubt that under the rule of the English Government it might in the course of a few years produce a land rent of treble that Sum, I do not think myself warranted at this period x any immediate Revenue from this x in the first place, it might not be thought x to take the whole Island, and in the next if that step was adopted, a liberal encouragement of the present inhabitants might prevent for a period any advantage from the possession. 96. The only probable receipt would be from the duties collected which might be moderately fixed at an average of 3 pr. ct. on all Imports. 97. The total present Trade has been valued at one Crore &amp; sixty lacks of rupees, forty lacks of which, x &amp; the Red Sea would continue to find its mart a Muscat, &amp; about twenty lacks more consists of Specie &amp; bullion which pays no duty. After this deduction there remains one crore. Seventy lacks of which may safely assist on grounds already stated, would in the space of three years make this Settlement its Emporium, &amp; the Duties on this would more than meet the Current expences. Of the future possible increased Receipts from such duties, it is impossible to speak. Every circumstance, however, leads to a conjecture that this Port would at no distant period engross the whole Trade to the Gulph, to what amount that may rise it is difficult to determine, but it never has been nor can it ever will be, at a much lower ebb x 98. It now only remains to examine the last part of my subject vizt. The means most proper to carry this plan, if approved of, into execution. 99. Although the King of x exercises no positive authority over any of x Islands of the Gulph, those on the northern shore are all considered as part of the Empire and an application to him for grants of the Islands of Kishm and Anjam would be the first step towards carrying this plan into execution, 'both Islands would be necessary, as the English Governments might find it exp edient to build a work on Anjam for the protection of the shipping and even if they did not, they should at least have the power to prevent others from X Island. These grants would be easily obtained, as the Islands in their present state, are of no advantage whatever to the Government. As an equivalent for 3883 T. D,455 liol-. these Grants the Hon'ble Company might engage to clear the Sea as far as they were able of any pirates who continued to interrupt a Trade so advantageous to both Nations. 100. It would also seem of advantage to prevail upon the Persian Government to exempt from all Duties whatever the Company's staples, to increase their consumption, &amp; also to facili tate by external regulations the exportation of Carmenia W ool to the Settlement proposed; to which from its Vicinity to the province where that desireable article,is produced it might easil y be conveyed. 101., With X to the Trade carried on by private Merchants, it would be sufficient to stipulate in any Agreement concluded, that no increase of Duties on the articles of Commerce should be made. They are at present very moderate particularly those collected on that great Article of import. 1 102. The insular situation of the settlement would neither subject the Hon'ble Company, or those under their protection to any increased duties, or inconvenience from the necessity of the Trade passing through the Towns on the Coast under the rule of Arab Shaikhs for while a Government exists in Persia that can keep 2,000 Horse at Shiraz no one of these dare act contrary to its orders. 103. These Shaikhs collect customs it is true, at their respective Ports but it is only as Officers of the Persian Government &amp; they render a regular account. Whenever it happens that one of them during a period of anarchy &amp; revolution withholds his Tribute, he is called to a severe account for his neglect, &amp; he is generally plundered of double the amount. 104. The Shaikh of Bushire who is the most powerful among them, is at present from the capacity of the officers of Government, in the most reduced &amp; impoverished situation &amp; he transmits regularly to the Government a Tribute that amounts to within forty thousand rupees of his receipts. 1('5. It would only appear necessary to make a stipulation in the Treaty to be concluded that the severest punishment should be inflicted on the first Arab Shaikh or Governor of a province or Town on the Coast who obstructed or oppressed the Trade in any manner whatever. 106. Supposing Sunnuds obtained for the Islands of Kishm or Anjam x Com mercial Treaty concluded, it was x appear proper to enter into a x with the Imame of Muscat who might easily by some trifling concessions be not only reconciled to the measure but prevailed upon to facilitate its accomplishment. 107. There would be little difficulty I imagine in arranging matter to the satisfaction of Moullah Hussen, the present Chief of the Island of Kishm, any plan that offered him Comfort jfcfr security, would most probably be agreeable. If otherwise, he has no power whatever to make any opposition. 108. As to the inhabitants of this, &amp; every Island in the Gulph I speak from the testi mony of every one of them I have seen, they would hail with joy the day that placed them under the protection of the English flag or of any other indeed that was able to prevent their being plundered by their piratical neighbours. 109. After the Grants were obtained, and the Imame had given his consent to the measure (which many motives make me think desirable though not indispensible) a Ship of Force; should be sent by the Government of Bombay to anchor or in the Harbour, &amp; to remain till a spot was fixed upon for a Town &amp; a Fort, or at least a stockade for its protection was finished. 110. But this &amp; all other subordinate parts of the arrangement would of course be entrusted to the Hon'ble the Governor in Council at Bombay under whose Jurisdiction this Settlement would naturally be placed from x situation. 111. In closing this letter I am again impelled to solicit Your Lordship's indulgence to its errors, which I cannot but fear are numerous. I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, M y L oed, Your Lordship's most obedient and most humble Servant, JOHN MALCOLM, A bu S heeer ; The 26th February 1900. 2578 F.H456 APPENDIX I.
