Tide Tables. With reference to copies of correspondence forwarded under your endorsement No.994, dated 16th February 1938, the system in force hitherto for some year has been that the Port Trust had to purchase from the Government of India 65 volumes, each containing the Tide Tables of a very large number of standard Ports from England eastward to Japan, together with extensive data, at Rs.3/- per copy. The Port Trust sells about 47 copies at the same rate and the others are retained for Departmental use. 2. At one time, Government published the Aden Tide Tables separately, v/hich is all that is required, and when they ceased to do this and introduced the comprehensive volumes above referred to, the Port Trust asked for permission to abstract the Aden Tide Tables and publish them separately themselves, but a copyright fee of Rs.150/- per annum was demanded which the Port Trust did not feel Justified in incurring. 3. The Port Trust are willing to bear the charge of £15/- per annum, but would like to know for their information whether this includes the supply of free copies of the Aden Tables, and if so, how many, and what arrangements are proposed for the supply of Tables to the members of the Public at Aden who required them for purposes of business or pleasure.

The predictions are given in the Tide Tables of the Indian Ocean published by the Survey of India, but their cessation would not, in the opinion of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, affect navigation and they consider that they might well be discontinued, 3, The predictions for Aden are given in the Admiralty Tide Tables, and the Admiralty states that it THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, INDIA OFFICE. isis considered that they should continue to be given, as a Standard port in the locality is essential for the proper representation of the tides of the Indian Ocean. The predictions, which are also given in the Tide Tables of the Indian Ocean, are supplied to the Admiralty by the Survey of India under an arrangement whereby the Admiralty and the Survey of India exchange advance copies of tidal predictions. The predictions of ports supplied to the Survey of India are, it is stated, not limited to British Home Waters, since they include, for instance, Durban, Shanghai, and Wei-Hai-Wei which are predicted at Admiralty cost and without contribution from India. 4. If the Government of India are not prepared to continue the predictions for Aden in the Indian Tide Tables free of charge, the Secretary of State proposes to suggest to the Governor of the Colony that the predictions should be provided by the Liverpool Tidal Institute at a cost to the Colony understood to be £15 .

Tide Tables for Aden and Perim - Separation of Aden- Contribution. Sir I am directed to forward a copy of a letter from the Surveyor G-eneral of India No. 1196/1062, dated the 20th March, 1937, regarding the question of a contribution for the prediction and publication of Tide Tables for the ports of Aden arid Perim, which work has, before the separation o; Aden from India, been carried out by the Survey of India at the cost of Central Revenues. 2. The position is fully explained in the Surveyor G-eneral's letter referred to above, and I am to enquire whether, in the circumstances stated therein, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom desire that the Surveyor General of India should continue to prepare Tide Tables for the ports of iiden and Perim, and if so, whether they v-ill agree to contribute Rs.600 per annum towards the cost of those tables. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,Copy of a letter from the Surveyor General of India No. 1196/1062, dated the 20th March, 1937. Subject:- Tide Tables for Aden and Perim. I have the honour to refer to the forthcoming separation of Aden from India ?nd to enquire whether as a result of this, the Government of India wish to raise the question of a contribution for the prediction and publication of Tide Tables for the ports of Aden and Perim which are at present carried out by the Survey of India at the cost of Central Revenues. 2. The Survey of Indip is now responsible for the prediction and publication of Tide Tables of 41 ports. These fall in the following categories (i) India (after 1.4.37) 24 (ii) Burma 8 (iii) Ceylon and Marmagao 4 (iv) Men &amp; Perim 2 (v) Persian Gulf and Suez 3 The situation regaining contributions from cate gories (ii) to (v) is that - (iii) Ceylon and Marmagao already contribute, (ii) Burma is being dealt with in connection with the activities^of this Department after separation, (v) Suez and the 2 Persian Gulf ports Bushire and Muscat have never been invited to contribute ^ and as no change in the administration of these is contemplated there appears to be no reason for suggesting this now. 3. If the Government of India consider that the Home Government should be invited to pay for the prediction and publication of Tide Tables for Aden and Perim, as indeed appears to be desirable, it remains only to decide the amount and to what extent free copies of the Tide Tables for the Indian Ocean should be issued. In the case of category (iii) Ceylon and Marmagao the annual contribution has been fixed for many years at Bs.300/- per port vide your Department endorse ment No. 542 dated the 26th June 1923 and in addition 30 free- 2 -. copies of the Tide Tables are issued to Ceylon and 15 to the Portuguese authorities in Goa. 4 # in fixing the contribution at Rs.300/- the cost of printing the tide tables, Rs.210/-, was excluded from the total cost per port Rs.510/-. If we adopt the same basis now and exclude the cost of printing, the cost per open sea port works out at about Rs.340/- inclusive of full overhead charges. As the increase is small I would suggest that it be disregarded and that the Home Government be invited to contribute Rs.600/- or say £45 per annum for the two ports Aden and Perim and that they should be offered a free annual issue of the Tide Tables of the Indian Ocean up to a maximum of 15 copies for each port. 5. Tide Tables are published by calendar year and I recommend that the contribution, if asked for, should commence with the tables for the year 1938 and should be paid during the financial year 1937-38.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Education, Health and Lands Department.

The Regulations are comprised in two parts, Part I reLrtink to Public Officers and Part II relating to Public Business. x x x 3. I presuire thd Part I, Public Officers, will not apply to officidb of the C-overnment of India serving under foreign service terms at Aden, and that such officials will remain under Indian regulations in all respects. I shall be obliged if you will confirm this direct with the Government of India and inform me of their reply. Officials who transfer from service under the Government of India to service under the new Colonial Government are to preserve their Indian conditions intact and they must therefore remain subject to the Indian regulations govern ing those conditions. They will, however, come under Colonial Regulations for discipline. In this connection of the 29th July your attention is invited go my despatch No. 226 / last.Despatch No* 228 dated the 29th July 1936 froia his Lajesuyfc Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, to ana ag* Resident, Aden. I have the honour to inform you that I have hc.d under consideration, in consultation wit»h Sir Bernard Reilly, the interpretation which should be placed upon the pledge wnicn Wc.k&gt; ^iven in 1933 that when the control of the Aden Settlement passed from the Govt« of India to His Majesty T s Govermaent, coll Indian administrative personnel at ,xden at tne time oi the ticaisfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent. 2. Sir Bernard Reilly informs me that the subordinate staffs at iden have enquired whether this pledge applies to them in the same way as it applies to the administrative personnel, and that it is very desirable that a decision on the matter should be reached as soon as possible, as the staffs concerned desire to know what the position will be before they can decide whetAer they wish to remain in tne service of the new ndminisoration when the transfer of control takes place. 3. It was the intention of His majesty's Government that this assurance should apply t /0 all members of the subordinate staffs at Aden. If members of these staffs elect, to remain under the Colonial Government, oheir existing conditions of sex vice will in all respects be preserved intact, subject only to modifica tion by mutual consent^ that is to say, ee.cn officer will be entitled to retain his existing scale of salary, pension rights ,.nd other terms of employment. He will, however, be regarded, as from the date of the transfer, as a member of His Majesty’s Colonial Service, and will be subject accordingly to the provisions of the Colonial Regulations in regard to discipline etc. 4. The staffs concerned need have no apprehension that they will suffer adversely as the result of the application to them of the Colonial Regulations, whicn have been drawn up with great/great care in order to safeguard aaegaately the position of Colonial civil servants. The sections of Colonial Regulations which are more particularly concerned with conduct and discipline are Nos. 50-80 in Part I of the Regulations, and it is suggested thcit these sections should be brought, the attention pf the staffs in question.Government of India External Affairs Department From The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, To The Civil Secretary, Aden Government.

It will be seen that the Government of India agree with the proposal mads by this Office that the date of the cash transactions should determine the adjustment of the expenditure, subject to adjustments with sub-accountants or agwxcy transactions which, wider normal procedure, would be carried back into the account for the previous year, so long aa it remains open. In connection with the latter proviso, I am to invite your attention to paragraph 3 of the letter to tli© Government of India, from which it will be seen that it is * not likely to be operative and, in any ease, has no relation to the responsibility for deposit or advance accounts. fith regard to the establishment of a direct account between India and Aden, it will be seen that the Government of India are prepared to institute such an account which they suggest should be adjusted monthly, either through a single banking Institution or by means of a draft. I an to enquire whether Mr.0nasby-Gore concurs in the proposals for the demarcation of liability for expenditure in Aden after the 31st March, 1937, and for the InstitutionInstitution of an account current between that Colony and India. If eo* it ia preeuaed that you will furnish the information asked for by the Government of India and issue such instructions as may be necessary.

Sir, I am directed to refer to Mr.Turner's letter No.A.G. 9689/36 M.l, dated the 29th September, 1936 on the subject mentioned above. The Government of India agree to the proposal put forward in his letter of the 14th August last to the Colonial Office regarding the demarcation of liability for expenditure in Aden after the 31st March, 1937. 2. Concerning the establishment of a system of direct accounting between India and the new Colony of Aden, the matter is dealt with in para.2 of the Auditor General's note dated the 23rd November, 1936 and in para.l of his note dated the 15th February, 1937 of which copies, together with a copy of the note of the Accountant General, Bombay referred to by the Auditor General are enclosed. It will be seen inter alia that there will be a separate account in respect of postal transactions between the two countries. The question whether the post office accounts may be adjusted through the Exchange account between the two Governments or direct between two post offices is under consideration and a further communication regarding this will follow.3. In regard to the points raised in paras.2 and 3 of the Auditor General’s note dated the 15th February, 1937 cited above, I am to suggest that adjustments between Aden and India should take place monthly. As Aden will continue to use the Indian rupee, no question of exchange will arise. The Colonial Office may be asked to specify the designation of the officer who will exchange accounts with India. If the Colonial Office wish to employ a single banking institution for all exchange transactions with India, the Government of India will be satisfied to accept the same institution at its end. If, however, the Colonial Office would prefer adjustments to be made by draft, the Government of India have no objection. I have, etc. t „ . w . (Sd.) J.C.NIXON.

As regards the establishment of a direct account between India and Aden, a separate minor head ’’Account with His Majesty’s Colonial Government, Aden” has already been provided under the head ’’Accounts with Foreign Governments and Indian States” for the adjustment of financial transactions between the two countries after separation. This account will be operated after the manner of the direct accounts current now existing between India and the several colonies and Protectorate Governments in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Article 115 et seq of the Account Code. A reference is being made to the Accountant General, Bombay in regard to the precise machinery of settlement, including the periodical adjustments, which would be necessary, and a further communication will be made on receipt of his reply.

I forward herewith a copy of anote (with its enclosures) from the Accountant General, Bombay, containing his suggestions about the precise machinery of settlement that should be set up and the periodical adjustments that would be necessary in respect of the transactions between India and Aden after the separation. The Auditor General agrees with the Accountant General that the Account Current between India and Aden should be a regular two-sided account as in the case with other British Colonies and that the net balance in favour of India or Aden should be settled monthly or quarterly by cheques or bills of exchange as arranged mutually between the two Governments. The Accountant General, Bombay, will be the accounting officer in India in respect of the Account Current and will also act as the Audit Officer in respect of Indian Government personnel lent to Aden. The proposed Account will be independent of the Account Current that will be set up for the settlement of Postal transactions between the two countries.

As the Auditor General is aware, all transactions between India and Aden are at present adjusted through the 'Aden Suspense' account, clearance of the outstanding credits or debits in the suspense account being watched through a broadsheet specially prescribed for the purpose. I submit herewith two statements marked 'A' and 'B' which indicate the magnitude of the transactions adjusted through the suspense account. nCredits. Remittances Sale of Stamps P.L.I.Fund Debits. Less cheques 71,738 Miscellaneous other items 12,063 (net) 3. Statement 'A' shows the monthly credits and debits for the past twelve months (December 1935 to November 1936) originating in the Aden treasury passed on to this Office through the suspense head. The figures in the statement do not include transactions adjustable in England as such transactions will in future be adjusted direct by the Aden Colony. The net credit due to India (Rs.9,55,978) as worked out in the statement includes Rs.8,29,360* on account of transactions relating to the Posts and Telegraphs Department as detailed in the margin. It is presumed that these transactions will, in future, be adjusted through the Post Office Exchange Account ( vide para.4 of the Accountant General, India Office, D.O. letter to the Colonial Office, No.A.Q.8452-36. M.l, dated the 14th August, 1936).

It is likely that some of these adjustments will become unnecessary as a result of the impending changes in the administration of Aden. 7. As in future Aden will cease to be a part of British India It is, in my opinion, desirable that the new Account Current between India and Aden should be a regular two-sided account as is the case with other British Colonies. In accordance with Art.115 of the Account Code, the Accountant General, Central Revenues, is the accounting officer in respect of all accounts with the British Colonies. If, however, the Auditor General so desires, I would have no objection to take up the work in connection with the new Account Current as my office is already conversant with the details. (Sd.)

OFFICE OF THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL, BOMBAY.Copy of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Auditor-General's note No,170-Reforms/6-36, dated the 15th February, 1937. XX XX XX XX 2. The Auditor-General suggests that the Government of India in consultation with the India Office and the Colonial Office settle such details as the nomination of the Accounting Officer in Aden who will exchange accounts with India, the Banks through which the claims of the respective Governments will be adjusted and the period of adjustment. 3. It is presumed that the Indian rupee will continue to be the legal tender in Aden for some time to come. If so, the question of the rate of exchange raised in the concluding portion of paragraph 5 of the Accountant-General’s letter will not arise for the present. NEJ.8.4Minute Paper. Scy s~ P.Z. .«#*/37. Department. ' 47U5 5000 5.86 In connection with the separation of Aden on 1st April discussions have been proceeding for some time in regard to the financial adjustments which have to be made, and the Government of India forwarded in their letter of 7th lay, 1936 (P.Z. 3598/36) a memorandum going into the whole subject and suggesting, in &lt; roughly conclusion, that, since the sums in question appeared^Jo balance out, a no-payment settlement might be made. In the light of the settlement effected between Orissa, Sind and their four parent Provinces, and of the scheme adopted in regard to Burma, the proposals of the Government of India appeared to be pnma facie suitable, and they were put to the Colonial Office for consideration. After a certain amount of discussion the proposals m the Government of India’s memorandum have been accepted^by the Colonial Office, but two major points have qjtogy emerged whi^^m^ce^it impossible for the settlement to be made on a'no-payment^basis: First, one A of the main items in the balance sheet prepared by the Government of India was the sum of Rs.5 lakhs which had been lent by the Government of India to the Aden Settlement 7 und, and which was accordingly put by the Government of India among the sums to their credit at the date of separation. Since the balance sheet was prepared, however, the Aden Settlement have paid baclP5 lakhs to A the Government of India, and therefore it is proposed that as part of the settlement the 5 lakhs should be repaid to Aden by the Government of India. This seems quite reasonable. Secondly, the sum of nearly 4 lakhs was included by the Government of India in their balance sheet as a debit (i.e., as a sum to be paid by them to the Aden /Aden Colony) on account of the Kamaran Quarantine and Administration Funds. These funds are held by the Government of India on behalf of Kamaran, and in drawing up their balance sheet the Government of India assumed that Kamaran would be transferred to H.M.G. with Aden. At present, however, the future of Kamaran is in the balance, and it is quite possible that its management may be retained in the hands of the Government of India. In these circumstances vt&amp;iUcL the funds would not, of course, be to the Aden Colony. In these circumstances, the present proposal, which has been accepted both by the Colonial Office (P.Z. 1208/37) and by the Government of India (P.Z. 2095/37), is that there should be a no-payment settlement, except (a) that India should pay back the 5 lakhs recently received from Aden, and (b) that, if Kamaran is retained by India, these 5 lakhs should be reduced by the amount (approximately Rs.3,80,000) which represents the money in the Kamaran Quarantine and Administration Funds. It seems desirable that formal sanction should be obtained to cover the settlement which has been reached between the Colonial Office and the Government, and it is submitted that this may be accorded.

I am, however, to point out that circum stances have changed since the memorandum by the Government of India (enclosed in their letter to the India Office of the 7th of May, 1936) was prepared, owing to the repayment of the balance of the electricity loan which was included in the proposed settlement as a credit under the item 'Aden Settlement Fund Debt', and Mr. Ormsby Gore considers that it I ”1 THS UNDSH S SCHIST ARY OF STATS, INDIA OFFICS.would Ue an essential condition of the settlement that the 5 lakhs of rupees involved should he retransferred to Aden. 3.

The Government of India confirm that they are prepared for a period of about 5 years, to make available officers on foreign service to fill as many as possible of the posts mentioned in statement 'A' attached to Sir . Bernard Reilly’s note, which are at present filled by Indian Service personnel, and to supply substitutes in leave vacancies. The Foreign Service will be on a voluntary basis and subject to the approval of the Government of India and the consent of the Colonial office. The Government of India note that the period suggested would vary in regard to individual posts and agree that it would be a matter for arrangement as time goes on. As, however, some of the Aden posts are specifically included in the sanctioned Cadres Ox the Services concerned, it ....' \ vl it will be necessary for the Colonial Office to give sufficient notice of the filling up of any .of these posts by an officer of the Colonial Service, so that steps may be taken to effect a corresponding reduction in the Indian cadreo 3. The Government of India agree that ordinarily, officers lent to the Colonial Office on Foreign Service need not be granted as a result of the transfer of control any extra emoluments in addition to the pay ana allowances at present attached to their posts. The present rates take into account conditions in Aden but sane concessions may be necessary and this question will be discussed with Sir Bernard Reilly. 4. The Government of India note that leave and leave passage contributions will be paid by the Colonial Office in respect of officers lent to them (both substantive incumbents and leave substitutes) and that Colonial Revenues will also meet the travelling allowances of the leave substitutes to and from India to the extent admissiole under the existing rules. In regard to the substantive incumbent on leave, leave contribution is not payaole lor the period of leave but leave passage contribution will have to be paid for that period as the present rate of Ks. 50/- per mensem has been fixed with reference to the total period of foreign service whether the officer is on leave or on duty. The leave passage contributions above mentioned are in respect of Lee Concession passages admissible to officers of non-Asiatic domicile . Officers of Indian domicile serving in Aden are given leave passages to and from India once in three years ana the cost • • • •cost of these passages will fall on Colonial Revenues after separation. 5. Officers of the Indian police are given periodical grants in respect of chargers and uniform and a small contribution is levied in the case oi such oidicers on foreign service. This contribution in regard to the Commandant of Police in Aden who is borne on the Bombay cadre of the Indian Police will be a charge on Colonial Revenues after separation. 6. In regard to pensions, a reference is invited to paragraph 4 of the Government of India, Finance Department letter No. 2752-Ref./36, dated the 28th September 1936. 7. The Government of India do not anticipate any difficulty in reabsorbing into India those officers of the Indian Services, both superior end subordinate, who may be unwilling to be transferred to Colonial Service in spite of the assurance given about their future conditions of service. As regards the locally recruited staff, it may be expected that cases of unwillingness to enter Colonial Service will be very few, and the Government of India have nothing to urge against the views of His Majesty^ Government that no special charges in regard to these cases should fall on Colonial Revenues. 8.

Subjects I wish to discuss are those mentioned in three India Office Express letters of 12th August 1936 No. PZ. 6302/36. Most of these will probably have been settled in principle by Government of India’s reply to India Office, copy of which I have not yet received, but which I hope can be sent to me in time for me to study at Aden before I go to India. In that case I shall need to deal at Delhi mainly with questions of detail, and this I wish to do especially regarding Indian Service personnel who will remain at Aden on foreign service. In this connection may I be told before my visit Government of India’s views regarding amount of special allowance that should be given to them. In addition to points in three India Office letters of 12 August 1936 I should like also to discuss question raised in my letter 8465 of 19th November 1936 to Government of India and question of future policy regarding salt imports from Aden to India. I am grateful for arrangements you are making for my stay at Delhi. I am now proposing to return by mail leaving Bombay on February loth extending my time at Delhi if necessary or spending about a week in Bombay and elsewhere if discussions at Delhi are completed.

Mr. Walton , You will remember that on P.Z.5526/36 we sent to the Government of India for their observations the comments of the Colonial Office on the Government of India’s proposals for a financial adjustment on the ^ separation of Aden from India. The Government of India’s reply dated 28th September has now been received, and the Financial Secretary’s comments on it are attached. The next thing to do is to send the letter to the Colonial Office and ask them whether they still stick to their desire for a detailed calculation as at 31st March, 1937, or are prepared to settle the matter on a 'no-payment' basis. It seems almost certain that the Colonial Office will adhere to their previous view, but we are bound to ask them.

Si. It wi 11 be observed that the Government of India still adhere to their opinion that since the sum of money involved either way must be relatively inconsiderable, the very elaborate accounting investigation necessary to achieve an exact adjustment would not be justified; and they suggest accordingly/ once more that the matter might be settled on a 'no-payment' basis. I am to enquire whether Mr. Ormsby-Gore is prepared in all the circumstances to concur in the Government of India’s view the /I (3 i P. Z. 7218/36. Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department.

Would you kindly let us have your observations on Mr.Nixon’s q letter. Prima facie it would seem that the repayment of the loan due from the Aden Settlement Fund has rather knocked the bottom out of the Government of India’s u ' original suggestion for a no payment settlement, and I do not see how in these circumstances we can press the Colonial Office to leave the matter on a M no payment' basis without further calculations. However, if you can think of any reasons for so pressing them so much the better / 'i Political Secretary, Having no idea how the balance sheet would look if we brought the buildings in (as we are doing in the case of Burma) f I am really unable to say what force there is in the third sentence of paragraph 3 of l.Ir. Nixon’s letter. As the Government of India do not go back on this part of their proposals, I suspect that either they also do not know or they guess that the result would not help them, I fear I can think of no additional arguments for pressing the summary settlement on the Colonial Office and 4795if they refuse the Government of India 's present request I see no reason why we should feel undue disappointment. The rest of the letter seems all right so far as it goes. / 4No.D/2752-Ref./36. ! ! ^ / fV C Government of India© -7 q i Q Pintfice Department* / l~. i ' J Simla, the -cO - September, 1936. From The Bbn'ble Mr* J.C.Nixon, C.S.I.,C*I.B.,1.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India* To The tfoder Secretary of State for India* Political Department, India Office, London, S.W. 1, Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No.P.Z.5526-^6 dated the 15th August 1936, on the subject of financial adjustments consequent upon the separation of Aden from India. 2 # I am to state that since the original memorandum was compiled the Aden Administration has, at its own request, been permitted to repay the balance of the loan due from the Aden Settlement Fund. I enclose a copy of the correspondence on this matter. 3* Except for this circumstance, the Government of India would have pressed strongly for the summary settlement pro posed in paragraph 15 of the manorspdum accompanying my letter No. D/l079-Ref./36 dated the Tth^May 1936 so as to save the meticulous accounting otherwise necessary. Even now the Government of India would suggest to the Secretary of State that he should request the Colonial Office to re consider the matter. In view of the fact that the Govern ment of India are prepared summarily to hand over the civil property, other than the assets of the Posts snd Telegraphs Department, free, and that the sum of money involved either way must be relatively inconsiderable, the Government of India consider that it will be not worth while undertaking the accounting investigation. The relevant figures as on 31st March 193? will not in any event be available until the end of the calendar year. However, I an to offer the following observations on points arising out of the letter from the Colonial Office.-2 4. The GovermiEnt of India await any suggestions which the Colonial Office may have to make in regard to future pensions arising out of service in Aden, in regard to which, however, I am to draw attention to item (b) in paragraph 11 of the memorandum aid what is stated about that item in that paragraph. 5. In regard to paragraph S of the letter from the Colonial Office, I an to explain that the initial block account of the Posts and Telegraphs Department on 1st April 1925 was arrived at by taking the deprecia te d value of all assets (except land) on that date. From that time depreciation has been regularly provided, up to the year 1933-34 on a sinking fund basis and thereafter on a straight line plan. Up to the year 3930-31 the Posts and Telegraphs Department had no assets in Aden other than buildings. The life of such buildings up to 1933-34 was assumed to be 75 years and thereafter ICO years. The Rs. *19 figure represents the net (i.e. after meeting replacements) accretion to the depreciation fund up to 31st March 1935. The Government of India have no reason to believe that their depreciation rates have been on the low side. In fact, the general evidence is to the contrary. These are the values at which these assets and liabilities enter the commercialised public accounts of the Posts and Telegraphs Department and they are believed by the Government of India to be reasonable. 6 . The point raised in paragraph 13 of the original memorandum may be taken as arising only in the Posts and Telegraphs Department. In any event, it is not likely to he one of any moment. The matter is being referred to the India Office separately by the Department of Industries and Labour and the decision arrived at in that correspondence can, if necessary, be“taken into account in the finai calculations) which be done as on Slst March 1937.

The revenue in t.,-,. Protectorate estimates would consist, initially» whol-y of a grant from the Imperial Treasury but Eis Majesty’s Government would also make contributions as at present towards that part of the expenditure in the Colony of Aden considered to be on Protectorate services. The present contributions of His Majesty's Government of this nature are in respect ox: (a) The Armed Police, The Armed Police replaced an Indian infantry battalion and are there largely for defence purposes, (b) The Civil Hospital, Although the hospital 19 maintained the Government of India a large proportion of its patients (approximately 00 per cento) come from the Protectorate^ (e) Residency and Treasury Kstablishmenvr Som‘ of the staff are wholly or partly engaged on Protectorate work., 2 . S ir Bernard Reilly referred to the draft Estimates attached to his comprehensive memorandum dated the 5th May, 1936, The draft Estimates are based on actuals for the last three years s but take into account the increased revenue which it is hoped i ^ increased expenditure which appears unavoidable. The draft Estimates show a small aurpluo* but tnio rescj . must be regarded as provisional only until fUx-uher information is available regarding future iric-me tax receipts, the prospects of the salt industry and ,.-* future of the Abyssinian trade. It is also not clear whether the receipts under (e) above have been taken tn to account when the draft Estimates were prepared.Sir Bernard Reilly said that he regaz'ded the question of income tax as the most important of these threeo The estimated receipts from this source are based on the figure given for 1932-33 v namely* 2? lakhs of i rupees* hut much would depend on the arrangements made regarding such firms as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the salt and shipping companies who do large business in Aden hut at present pay income tax in Xndia 0 The most important Industn^y in Aden is the salt industry* At present Aden is within the tariff x^all set up by the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Actj, I93X, and 50 per cent of the Indian salt imports come from Aden- The fear is that when Aden ceases to he part of British India she will he outside the tariff wall and the salt industry may he ruined. It is hoped to induce the Government of India either to abolish the tariff on Adea salt or concede it a special tariff* It would have a most unfortunate political effect if the first result of the separation of Aden from British India was the ruin of the only important industry in Adeno The new situation in East Africa may result in the Italians diverting their trade from Aden to Italian ports* If this happens* the trade of the port of Aden would he seriously affected and the i'evenue of the new Colony would suffer 0 Un Sir Bernard Reilly said that, he agreed with Mr 0 Cowell that the budget should he in two parts- The Colonial budget would have to he submitted to the now Executive Council and should be in such a form as to allay the fears which already exist that the new Colon,, will have to pay for the Protectorate* The Protectorate budget wotild not be submitted to the Executive Council*5 - T ■ ■ 0 ^ r ' And er son said that the future arrajugeroonts regarding double taxation had been raised in a recent letter received from the Government of India (a copy of which was handed round at the meeting) which suggested that an agreement on this subject between themselves and His Majesty s Government would be necessary^ Up be date figures v/oW d be required before details of any a men go* - men: could be considered As regards salt* Mr, Anderson said that the Government of India's letter showed that Aden would probably be allowed to remain within the tariff wail until the expiry of the present Act i*e* until Aprii 1938 The Government of India had asked for the views of His Ua.esty f s Government on this points 6 -. M iv Cowell pointed out that the figures for income tax receipts could net be known until the first assessment had beer, made? say six months after the trans fer, He also pointed out that the Colonial Office Model Income Tax Ordinance made elaborate provisions for double income tax, Mr, Anderson said that Burma were taking over the Indian Income Tax 'Law mutati s mutan&amp;ie and he asked why the same thing could not ba done in the case of Aden. 8 &lt;&gt; It was agreed that the possibility of adapting the Indian Income Tax Law for Aden 5 subject tc the adjust ment of double taxation* should be examined., 9o Mxv Ha.ie referred to the proposal, of the Colonial Office that there should be two budgets? one for the Colony and one for the Protectorate* and he said that a combined budget might be preferable 10, Mr Cowell drew at tention to Mr,. Grieve * s letter of the i’lth August* 1933* tc Mr, Laithwaite (page 23 ofM.K., 50) in which the following passage occurs:- 'V7e agree that it is desirable to scotch the rumour which appears to he current in Aden that the annual contribution of Rs *20 lakhs (£150,000} of which India would he relieved in tne event of separation f would in future be borne by Aden.. We have no objection^, therefore* tc your authorizing the Government of India to issue a statement to the effect that the annual contribution of Rs»5Q lakhs would in future be borne by Imperial revenues* and that no additional charge on this account would be imposed on the revenues of Aden’*., In view of this letter Mro Hale agreed that the Treasury could not press for the incorporation of Protectorate expenditure with the Settlement budget* llo Gir Bern ard Reilly said that in hie opinion it was essential that any surplus which might acci^ue to the new Colony should go to form a reserve fund tc be used for capital expenditure such as building etc Mr. Cow ell agreedp and said that the new Colony would be entitled to exist under the same conditions as any other Colony.. There might be a case later for asking them to make a voluntary contribution towards defence as has been done in the case of other Colonies* but suob contributions (apart from certain statutory contributions in the Eastern Colonies) always depend on the financial conditions of the territory concerned and are always of a voluntary nature., 12* Discussion then centred round the form cf the budget and it appeared that* for practical purposes? there were the following three alternatives(1) A combined budgets The objections to this were (a) the necessity to avoid giving any impression that the Colony would be paying for the Protectorate; and (b) the technical difficulty of making a grant- in-aid if the Colony wore to show a surplus (2) One budget separated into two parts s one for* the Colony itself and 'che other for the Protectorate* the latter comprising a grant in-aid to meet all expenditure* The difficulty here would be that there might be technical objections to making a grunt« in-aid to a territory which had no revenue of its own* (3) Two budgets* one for the Colony and the other* for the Protectorate* the latter to continue as at present as a sub-head of the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote* The objections to this were that complica tions might arise owing to the overlapping of staffs There would also be difficulties regarding questions of pensions* income tax, etc-. 13c, It was finally agreed that the Treasury should examine this question and give their views on the under standing that the Colony would not be asked to bear any expenditure on Protectorate* political or military services, Fi nanc ial Adjus tment, b etween His Ma je sty 's Coyernmch 1 * and th p GoWrhment of India , 14:3 Mr _ Cow ell referred to the proposals contained in the Government of India's memorandum on this subject* He first deal with the question of Aden v s pensionary liabilities (paragraph 11 of the memorandum) and said that thethe Colonial Office felt some hesitation in accepting the proposal that the new Colors should accept liability for pensions already in issue* 15, Sir Bernard Reilly suggested that pensions must be regarded as deferred pay in respect of services rendered to the Government of India and that it would bo inequitable that the new Colony should be burdened with this liability at the beginning of its existence* I 60 Mr « Anderson said that the proposed apportionment erf pension liability was similar to that adopted in the case of Burma in accordance with the recommendations of the Indo-Burma Tribunal, presided over by Mr* Amery, and that it would be very difficult to mo vq the Government of India from applying the same theory to Aden* Broadly* the theory was that India* including Aden* had incurred certain pensionary liabilities and that it was for the new Colony to assume such proportion of that liability an applied tc Aden on the date of transfer* J ^ 7 ' 1 M r, Hale said that after consideration the Treasury were not prepared to oppose the Government of India 9 a proposals on the subject of pensionsc Although no pensionary liability was being a 3 sumo cl in the case of the India Office staff* different considerations obtained in the ease of Burma and Aden* where the new Governments were talcing over revenueo The Treasury would therefore probably be prepared to agree in principle to the pension proposals in paragraph IX of the Government of India's memorandum on the understanding 9 hc-v/ever s that the method of calculating Aden's liability under paragraph II * d) “Future pensions arising out of part time service * whether before or after separation) in Aden' would require special o q nsidera tionconsideration? as technical points as to the me-hod calculation were involved? 13 . Mr- Cowell then referred to paragraph 13 of toe Government of India's memorandum where It is intimated tna? Aden would he expected to meet any eomponaaticn p's yah - to officials at present serving in Aden who are unwilling to continue to serve after the transfer and who cannot he realsorted into the Indian establishment? - h * begonia- Office were opposed tc the payment of compensation to officials who were unwilling to continue service in dc - - aftcr the transfer. The liability of Aden tc these Individuals would be completely met if they were offeree a continuance of service in Aden on the terms on which they are at present serving. If they did not wish to continue to serve after the transfer and could not be reabsorbed into the Indian Service, no responsibility would lie on the Colony of Aden* X9, Mis Ander sen said that the India Office would be reluctant to override the Government of India on this point but the views of the Colonial Office -c ) i ii&lt; passed on for consideration* 20 . sir Bernard Reilly explained in this connection that service in Aden was not popular. The higher officials who decided to remain in Aden would be on foreign service and could not be compelled to continue service in Aden, while some of the subordinate officials recruited in India would wish to return to India where their prospects would be better,. This, of cuirae, di„ not apply to officials recruited exclusively for service in Aden, who, he anticipated would be willing to remain if their conditions of service remained unaltered, 21 . Mr. Powell referred to the question of the transfer of existing buildings. The Government of Indiaxvere prepared to transfer free to the new Government existing military buildings and civil buildings, with the exception of those belonging to the Post Office and T'r&gt;i Rnh.-,ntis DeiDartment ; nrsln-ninl OfflCQ had hoped that all hull dings would ho transferred free of charge to the new Government and the distinction made between Poet Office hulldlnga and other hull dings was not altogether olearo 22c Sir Bernard Reilly suggested that if the Post Office hull dings were to form a liability* the new Colony should also take over seme of the profile made t?y vh- Department as a result of the construction of those hulldings 23 0 Mr* Ande rson explained that the Pos*: Gill c and Telephones Department was run on a commercial haste and that the buildings are represented as a cash xtom in the Department’s accounts,, gj k Mr, Cowell said that if the buildings were not to be transferred free there appeared to be a ease for allowing a larger sum as depreciation than that proposed by the Government of India (namely 19 lakhs), but the India Office representatives said boat it might he difficult to induce the Government of India to allow a larger sum for depreciation than that shown in their own Department 's bocks, 25 . Hr, Cowell then pointed out that the acceptance of the Government of India's proposals would result in the Colony being liable for the Savings Bank deposits in Aden, It was true that this liability would be offset by certain assets, but these latter would be in the form of buildings and would not be easily realisable. It was notnot clear whether the new Government v/ould take over the Savings Bank or whether a branch of the existing Bank would be opened in Aden c The first alternative would be preferable 26* It was pointed out that the tendency is for deposits to increase rather than to be withdrawn so that it should not be necessai'y for the Gclony to hold a large sum in cash in this respect* The conclusion was reached that the Crown Agents should if necessary be asked to make temporary advances to Aden to meet any excess of withdrawals o^er deposits and also to corer day to day expenditure until Aden was in a position to meet the expenditure on these services from its own revenues. 2 ?* The meeting reached the conclusion that, subject to (a) the question of compensation tc officials v/ho declined to continue serving in Aden, and (b) the amount of depreciation to be allowed on the Post Office buildings, the proposals of the Government of India might be acceptable in principle,, Acceptance however, would be on the understanding that the settlement would be on the same principles as those proposed in the present memorandum but on the basis of figures compiled as on the 31st March, 1937* and that cash adjustments should be made as on that date* This would involve, inte r alia a reduction in the book debt mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s meniorandumof\ 9639/56 . 1 .

His Majesty’s Government would he glad to have it confirmed that the Government of India are prepared for sometime to come (say about five years - though of course the period would vary in respect of individual posts and would be a matter for arrangement as time goes on) to make avaibble officers on foreign service to fill as many as possible of the|nolovanfr posts mentioned in Statement A attached to Sir B. Reilly* s not^ and as a corollary to supply leave substitutes from India as suggested. In the note and statement the word 'deputation'* is used where of course 'foreign service' is. appropriate. Assuming the Government of India are prepared to accept this principle (which seems to follow naturally on the pledge given by His Majesty's Government to employ a y proportion of Indian Service personnel for some years after separation), the detailed/detailed arrangement*in regard to individuals must be left for settlement between the Government of India and Sir B.Reilly* It is however desirable at this stage to raise the following general points: (1) Foreign Service terms do not include a 25$ addition to emoluments as specified by the Chief Commissioner* Prima facie there is no reason why officers on Foreign Service in Aden under the Colonial Office should receive larger emoluments than they received in precisely the same posts and under the same conditions before transfer under the Government of India. It may however be necessary to make some concession in view of the fact that Aden is not an attractive station. Colonial Office are content that this matter should be discussed by Government of India with Reilly, but it would be useful to them to have, meanwhile a general indication of the Government of Indian view. Cot^/oi ( 2 ) l-wptPial Revenues will pay leave and leave passage contributions in respect of officers employed on Foreign Service besides the emoluments and passages (and allowances) to and from India of leave substitutes, but not the emoluments of the substantive incumbents while on leave. (3) Although there would be advantages/Draft Paper Department 3. advantages in the payment by iHrot/ of pension contributions in respect of officers on Foreign Service at Aden, it would probably be simpler, in view of the arrangement envisaged for the allocation between Impspial and Indian Revenues of pensions of officers with service partly in India and partly in Aden that this latter arrangement should apply throughout. * (4) A s it appears from Statement A that practically all the superior staff is ready to remain for a time at Aden, and as Sir B.Reilly anticipates that the great majority of subordinate personnel tt S(hVl'u will be ready to penmaefi (provided an assurance about their future conditions of service is given), it is assumed that there is unlikely to be serious difficulty about reabsorbing into India such officers as do not wish to remain. Any individual cases of difficulty may perhaps be left to be His Majesty^ Government are unlikely provisional attitude on the principle involved, viz: that if an officer is offered the chance of continuing in Aden in his existing post and on his existing conditions of service and refuses. settled as they arise.

Downing Street. 30 July, 1936, Sir, ,5&lt;iS SJ»' I am directed 'by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to refer to Stewart’s letter of the 28th May P.Z.3598/36, enclosing a memorandum relating to the financial adjustments on the separation of Aden from India, and to the subsequent discussion thereon at the Colonial Office on the 19th June and to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that Mr. Ormsby Gore considers that a settlement should be effected on the following lines 2. Paragraphs 6 t 7. 9 of the Memorandum. It is considered that a cash adjustment should be effected with the Government of India on the basis of the actual balances standing in the books of the Aden Treasury on the date of transfer (31st March 1937). 3. Paragraph 8 . It is noted that whilst it is agreed that transfer of the Civil and Military Buildings to the 30IJJO VPQMfl THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, &lt; , POLITICAL DEPARTMENT, 92611000? INDIA OFFICE. newnew Colony should he effected without charge, an * adjustment is proposed in the case of Post Office and Telephone buildings. It is understood that the reason for this differentiation in treatment is the fact'that the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department is run on a commercial basis and that in such circumstances definite loan charges in respect of those buildings can be * * identified in the public debt of India. Mr. Ormsby Gore is prepared therefore to accept the proposal that the value of those buildings should be taken into account and form part of the cash adjustment referred to above. He considers however that the value of the buildings should be taken as that existing at the date of transfer (and not at 31 March 1935 as suggested by the Government of India) and that furthermore the rate of depreciation should be greater than that allowed for in the memorandum. The latter appears to be very low (less than 1 per cent •per annum) and I am to request that the question of allowing a higher rate of depreciation may be taken up with the Government of India. 4. Paragraphs 11, 12, 15 and 16. The proposals regarding the allocation of5. the cost of pensions existing at the date of.trans fer and of those awarded thereafter are agreed to generally, subject to the reservation that Mr, Ormsby .Gore is unable to agree with the proposal in paragraph 13 that Aden shouldjaccept any liability for the payment of compensation to individuals in the service of the Government of India who may be unwilling to continue to serve in Aden after 31 March 1937, The liability of Aden to these individuals, it is considered, would be met if they were to be offered a continuance of service after that date on exactly the same terms as those on which they are at present serving. If they do not wish to continue on thope terms it is considered that no liability in the matter can be held to fall on Aden. Mr. Ormsby Gore also considers that the question of Aden’s liability in respect of future pensions arising out of part time service (whether before or after separation) in Aden will require further consideration in view of the technical points involved as to the method of calculation.5 . I am accordingly to request that should the Secretary of State in Council see no objection, the above views may be transmitted to the Government of India for their favourable consideration. I am.

Sir Bernard Reilly Resident and chief Commissioner at Aden Mr. Clauson ) India office. Mr. Anderson ui Hale Treasury. Hr. Blaxter ) Mr. Boyse ) Colonial Office. Mr. Palmer \ Mr. James ) A» Future financial arrangements* 1* Mr* Cowell said that he wished to emphasize the fact that in dealing with the future financial arrangements for Aden we were bound by certain pledges* These were:- (i) that India would be relieved of her present annual contribution of £160,000 towards the military and political administration, and that no part of this sum should fall on Aden revenues; (ii) that we would do our utmost to maintain the present standard of administration; and (iii) that we would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in our opinion, absolutely necessary. It was essential not only that these pledges should be honoured, but that no impression should be given thatpart of the expenditure on the Protectorate would be borne by the new Colony. it was for this reason that the Colonial Office proposed that there should be two budgets* one for the Colony and one for military* political and Protectorate matters. The revenue in the Protectorate estimates would consist* initially, wholly of a grant from the imperial Treasury but His Majesty^ Government would also make contributions as at present towards that part of the expenditure in the colony of Aden considered to be on Protectorate services. The present contributions of His Majesty^ Government of this nature are in respect of: (a) The Armed Police. The Armed police replaced an Indian infantry battalion and are there largely for defence purposes. (b) The Civil Hospital. Although the hospital is maintained by the Government of India a large proportion of its patients (approximately 60 per cent. ) come from the Protectorate© (c) Residency and Treasury Sstablishment. Some of the staff are wholly or partly engaged on Protectorate work. 2* 3lr Bernard Reilly referred to the draft estimates attached to his comprehensive memorandum dated the 6th May* 1966. The draft Estimates are based on actuals for the last three years* but take into account the increased revenue which it is hoped to obtain and increased expenditure which appears unavoidable. The draft sstimates show a small surplus, but this result must be regarded as provisional only until further information is available regarding future Income tax receipts* the prospects of the salt industry and the future of the Abyssinian trade. It is also not clear whether the receipts under (c) above have been taken into account when the draft Estimates were prepared. 3.5. sir Bernard Reilly said that he regarded the question of income tax as the most important of these three. The estimated receipts from this source are 'based on the figure given for 1932-33, namely, 2i lakhs of rupees, hut much would depend on the arrangements made regarding such firms as the Anglo-Iranian oil company and the salt and shipping companies who do large business in Aden but at present pay income tax in India. The most important industry in Aden is the salt industry. At present Aden is within the tariff wall set up by the salt (Additional Import Duty) Act, 1931, and 50 per cent of the Indian salt imports come from Aden. The fear is that when Aden ceases to be part of British India she will be outside the tariff wall and the salt Industry may be ruined. It is hoped to induce the Government of India either to abolish the tariff on Aden salt or concede it a special tariff# It would have a most unfortunate political effect if the first result of the separation of Aden from British India was the ruin of the only important industry in Aden. The now situation in East Africa may result in the Italians diverting their trade from Aden to Italian ports. If this happens, the trade of the port of Aden would be seriously affected and the revenue of the new Colony would suffer. 4# 31r Bernard Reilly said that he agreed with Mr. cowell that the budget should be in two parts. The Colonial budget would have to be submitted to the new Executive council and should be in such a form as to allay the fears which already exist that the new colony will have to pay for the protectorate. The ProtectorateIIJ% Anderson said that the future arrangements regarding double taxation had been raised In a recent letter recaiTed from the Government of India (a copy of which was handed round at the meeting) which suggested that an agreement on this subject between themselves and Hie Majesty’s Government would be necessary* Up to date figures would bo required before details of any arrange ment could be considered. As regards salt, Mr. Anderson said that the Goveri&amp;aent of India’s letter showed that Aden would probably be allowed to remain within the tariff wall until the expiry of the present Act i.e. until April 1938* The Government of India had asked for the views of His Majesty's Government on this point. 6. Mr^ Cowell pointed out that the figures for income tax receipts could not be known until the first assessment had bean made, say six months after the transfer. He also pointed out that the Colonial Office Model Income Tax Ordinance made elaborate provisions for double income tax. 7. Mr. Anderson said that Burma were taking over the Indian Income Tax Law mutatls mutandis and he asked why the same thing could not be done in the case of Aden. 8. It was agreed that the possibility of adapting the Indian Income Tax Law for Aden, subject to the adjust ment of double taxation, should be examined* Mr. Hale referred to the proposal of the Colonial Office that there should be two budgets, one for the colony and one for the Protectorate, and he said that as a matter of technical convenience a combined budget would probably be preferable. Mr. cowell drew attention to Mr. Grieve's letter of the 17th August, 1933, to Mr. Laithwaite (page 23 of M.S.&amp;0)M.S.50) in which the following passage occurs:- ^We agree that it is desirable to scotch the runout which appears to be current in Aden that the annual contribution of Rs.20 lakhs (£160*000) of which India would be relieved in the event of separation* would in future be borne by Aden* We have no objection* therefore, to your authorizing the Government of India to issue a statement to the effect that the annual contribution of Rs*80 lakhs would in future be borne by Imperial revenues* and that no additional charge on this account would be imposed on the revenues of Aden* * In view of this letter Mr. Hale agreed that the Treasury \ could not press for a combined budget. 11* 3ir Bernard Reilly said that in his opinion it was essential that any surplus which might accrue to the new Colony should go to form a reserve fund to be used for capital expenditure such as building etc* Mr* cowell agreed* and said that the new colony would be entitled to exist under the same conditionals any other Colony* There might be a case later for asking them to make a voluntary contribution towards defence* as has been done in the case of other Colonies* but such contributions (apart from certain statutory contributions in the Eastern Colonies) always depend on the financial conditions of the territory concerned and are always of a voluntary nature* 12* Discussion then centred round the form of the budget and it appeared that* for practical purposes, there were the following three alternatives:- (1) A combined budget* The objections to this wereto —’—^ (He (a) the necessity to avoid giving any impression that the Colony would be paying for the Protectorate; and (b) tiie technical difficulty of making a grant- in-aid if the Colony were to show a surplus* ( 2 ) One budget separated into two parts 9 one for the Colony Itself and the other for the Protectorate* the latter comprising a grant-in- aid to meet all expenditure* The difficulty here would be that there might be technical objections to making a grant-in-aid to a territory which had no revenue of its own. (3) Two budgets* one for the colony and the other for the Protectorate* the latter to continue as at present as a sub-head of the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote* The objections to this were that complica tions might arise owing to the overlapping of staff* There would also be difficulties regarding questions of pensions, income tax, etc* 13* It was finally agreed that the Treasury should examine this question and give their views on the under standing that the Colony would not be asked to bear any expenditure on Protectorate, political or military services* B* Financial Adjustment between His Majesty^ govermaent and the oovernmont ot India* Mr* cowell referred to the proposals contained in the oovernment of India’s memorandum on this subject* He first dealt with the question of Aden’s pensionary liabilities (paragraph 11 of the memorandum) and said that the Colonial office felt some hesitation in accepting the proposalproposal that the new colony should accept liability for pensions already in issue* 15* sir Bernard Reilly suggested that pensions must he regarded as deferred pay in respect of services rendered to the Government of India and that it would he Inequitable that the new Colony should be burdened with this liability at the beginning of its existence. 16. Mr. Anderson said that the proposed apportionment of pension liability was similar to that adopted in the case of Burma in accordance with the recommendations of the Indo-Burma Tribunal# presided over by Mi*. Amery, and that it would be very difficult to move the Government of India from applying the same theory to Aden* Broadly# the theory was that India# including Aden# had incurred certain pensionary liabilities and that it was for the new colony to assume such proportion of that liability as applied to Aden on the date of transfer* Mr* Hale said that after consideration the Treasury were not prepared to oppose the Government of India’s proposals on the subject of pensions* Although no pensionary liability was being assumed in the case of the India Office staff# different considerations obtained in the case of Burma and Aden# where the new Governments were talcing over revenue* The Treasury would therefore probably be prepared to agree in principle to the pension proposals in paragraph 11 of the Government of India’s memorandum on the understanding# however# that the method of calculating Aden’s liability under paragraph 11 (d) •♦Future pensions arising out of part time service (whether before or after separation) in Aden' would require special considerationconsideration, as technical points as to the method of calculation were involved* 13« Mr, Cowell then referred to paragraph 13 of the Government of India*s memorandum where it is intimated that Aden would be expected to meet any compensation payable to officials at present serving in Aden who are unwilling to continue to serve after the transfer and who cannot be reabsorbed into the Indian establishment* The Colonial Office were opposed to the payment of compensation to officials who were unwilling to continue service in Aden after the transfer. The liability of Aden to these individuals would be completely met if they were offered a continuance of service in Aden on the terms on which they are at present serving* If they did not wish to continue to serve after the transfer and could not be reabsorbed into the Indian service, no responsibility would lie on the Colony of Aden* 19* Mr* Anderson said that the India Office could not override the Government of India on this point but the views of the Colonial Office would be passed on for consideration* 20* 3lr Bernard Reilly explained in this connection that service in Aden was not popular* The higher officials vho decided to remain in Aden would be on foreign service and could not be compelled to continue service in Aden, while the subordinate officials recruited in India would mostly wish to return to India where their prospects would be better. This, of course, did not apply to officials specially recruited in Aden/for service in Aden* 21 * Mr* Cowell referred to the question of the transfer of existing buildings* The Government of India were preparedprepared to transfer free to the new Oowemment existing military buildings and civil buildings, with the exception of those belonging to the Post Office and Telephones Department. The Colonial Office had hoped that all buildings would be transferred free of charge to the new Government and the distinction made between Post Office buildings and other buildings was not altogether clear. 22. sir Bernard Reilly suggested that if the Post Office buildings were to form a liability, the new Colony should also take over some of the profits made by the Department as a result of the construction of those buildings. 23. Mr. Anderson explained that the Post Office and Telephones Department was run on a commercial basis and that the buildings are represented as a cash item in the Department's accounts. 24. Mr. Cowell said that if the buildings were not to be transferred free there appeared to be a case for allowing a larger sum as depreciation than that proposed by the Government of India (namely 19 lakhs), but the India Office representatives said that it might be difficult to induce the Government of India to allow a larger sum for depreciation than that shown in their own Department’s books. 25. Mr. Cowell then pointed out that the acceptance of the Government of India’s proposals would result in the colony being liable for the Savings Bank deposits in Aden. It was true that this liability would bs offset by eertain assets, but these latter would be in the form of buildings and would not be easily realisable. It was notnot clear whether the new Government would take over the Savings Bank or whether a branch of the existing Bank would be opened in Aden. The first alternative would be preferable. 26. It was pointed out that the tendency is for deposits to increase rather than to be withdrawn so that it should not be necessary for the colony to hold a large sum in cash in this respect. The conclusion was reached that the crown Agents should if necessary be asked to make temporary advances to Aden to meet any excess of withdrawals over deposits and also to cover day to day expenditure until Aden was in a position to meet the expenditure on these services from its own revenues. 27. The meeting reached the conclusion that, subject to (a) the question of compensation to officials who declined to continue serving in Aden, and (b) the amount of depreciation to be allowed on the Post office buildings, the proposals of the Government of India might be acceptable in principle. Acceptance however, would be on the understanding that the settlement would be on the same principles as those proposed in the present memorandum but on the basis of figures compiled as on the 31st March, 1937, and that cash adjustments should be made as on that date. This would involve, inter alia a reduction in the book debt mentioned in paragraph 8 of the Government of India's memorandum.AIR MAIL C. No.200 G 1 ./ 36 .- Government of India, Finance Department (Central Revenues), Simla, the 11th June, 1936. My dear Baxter, Aden - Separation of - Arrangements in connection with Central Revenue subjects. The Government of India have just heard for the first time (through an incidental reference in the Secretary of State f s telegram R.No.1677, dated the 30th of May 1936, relating to the India Burma Trade and Immigration Agreements) that it is now contemplated that the date of the separation of Aden will he the 1st of April 1937. It seems therefore desirable that no time should be lost in beginning the consideration, from the administrative point of view, of the measures that will be necessary to tie up the loose ends that would otherv/ise be left when the separation takes place. I am, of course, concerning myself only with the subjects with v/hich this branch of the Finance Department deals. 2* Income-tax . There is no provision relating to Aden in the Government of India Act, 1935, comparable to section 159 of that Act, so that no arrangements for double income-tax relief as between India and Aden after separation v/ill be possible under Order in Council. If there is to be such a scheme, it will have to depend upon an agreement between the Government of India and whatever department of His Majesty’s Government takes over the administration of Aden; for brevity I shall venture in this letter to use the expression u Colonial Office’ 1 when I mean to refer to that department. Such an agreement, since it would not be enforced under the Government of India Act, would be entirely voluntary for the two administrations/administrations concerned and would 'be terminable at will. In India we could give effect to such an agreement by an order under section 60(1) of the Indian Income-Tax Act, 1922, comparable to the orders under v/hich we allow double income-tax relief as between British India and Indian States. 3. I have not the material to estimate the revenue significance of this proposal. The average collections under taxes on income’' in Aden in the two years ending 31st March 1935 were about 4 lakhs; but much of this must have come from incomes that will not after separation become liable to double taxation. We could only get figures for the balance by making hypothetical assessments in British India under section 4(2), section 42, etc. of our Act. Then again, at least two of the salt concerns are at present assessed in Bombay and there are probably other business concerns in a like case. Here again, we could only get an idea of the revenue involved by making hypothetical assessments of so much of the profits as would have fallen liable to assessment in Aden also if that territory had been already separated. 4. We have already considered roughly the outlines of such an agreement which we should suggest if the ’’Colonial Office” desired to enter into it. It seems to us that the problem of triple taxation as between the United Kingdom, Aden and India is likely, if it arises at all, to be of such negligible importance that it is desirable to leave it out of account; and our general idea is that the lines of the arrangement should follow the Indo-Burma scheme, with the elimination of this particular/3. -w particular complication. V/e should propose that, as with the India and Burma arrangement, relief should he shared in proportion to the rates of tax in the two countries, and that v/e should adhere to the ”rate u basis instead of the 'amount of tax''' basis, which was adopted in the case of Ceylon. Will you please have the necessary enquiries instituted to see whether the 'Colonial Office' v/ishes to enter upon such an agreement before the actual date of separation, so that we can agree upon the terms of the respective notifications that are to be issued by the two administrations? 5. Another group of problems in connection with income-tax which will have to be considered in due course is the same as that which we referred to in our telegram No.1218 dated the 21st of May 1936 about the draft Order in Council fixing the initial rates of income-tax for Burma - in particular, the problem regarding the effect of deductions at source before separation under section 18 and the comparable problem arising out of the operation of section 14(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act. It would be best to leave the details of these in the case of Aden for settlement after we have got further with our discussions with Burma* 6. Salt . So far as the duty on salt consumed in Aden is concerned, there seems to be no difficulty. That duty and the royalties on salt produced in Aden will, of course, now go to the Aden Administration instead of going to Central revenues. Duty on salt from Aden imported into British India will continue, as at present, to be collected in British India. One point which is deserving of special attention is the effect of the separation upon the/the salt (Additional Import Duty) Act, 1931&gt; as amended. This Act now extends till the end of April 1938 5 i.e., for 13 months after the projected date of separation. So far as the substantive taxing portion is concerned (sections 3 and 4), no change will arise apart from the omission, as otiose, of the words 'except Aden and perim' from sub-section (1) of section 3. What we have to consider is whether the relief which sub-section ( 1 ) of section 5 grants in certain conditions to salt produced in India shall in future be extended to salt produced in India and Aden. Provisionally, the Government of India are inclined to the view that, so long as the present life of the Act endures, this change should be made. The reasons in favour of this course are as follows. When the Bill which became the Extending Act of the current year was before the Legislature, 1 think that all parties, like ourselves, had a general idea that an extension up to the 30th of April 1938 was not likely to carry us over the date of separation. Nothing has been said about this in public but, as l say, there was a vague impression that the separation of Aden was likely to be postponed until somewhere about the date of the inauguration of the Federation. We can, therefore, regard ourselves as having a mandate from the Legislature to give the benefit of the provision mentioned to Aden throughout the life of the Act. There is also, of course, the consideration that three out of the four works are owned by Indian concerns. On the other side of the case, there are the following facts. The claim of the Indian concerns in Aden to consideration has been exaggerated, as we pointed out in paragraphs 2 to 6 of our letter in this department, No.C.55-Gl./33, dated the 13th/4 5 13th of February 1933, and m the second paragraph of F.&amp; P.Department letter No.F.143-N/35, dated the 11th of April 1935. There is further the consideration that after separation the Government of India will cease to be the ov/ners of these salt works, will not draw royalty from them and will not have the same power to control them that they have at present under the conditions of the leases. Whatever validity these latter considerations may have as against the maintenance of special treatment of the Aden salt works for a lengthy period, the Government of India are disposed to think that they should not outweigh the argument on the other side so far as the remaining period of 13 months is concerned; but before they reach a final decision they will be glad to have the views of His Majesty’s Government. 7. As already mentioned, this letter is meant to deal rather with administrative than legal considerations but 1 might point out that even if (as 1 personally believe) it would be outside the scope of an Order under section 293 or any other provision of the Government of India Act, 1935, to provide that section 5(1) of the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act, 1931, should be adapted so as to refer to salt produced in India or Aden, it will nevertheless be possible, if the Government of India decide in favour of such a course^ to give effect to the decision by the issue of a notification under section 23 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878.. 8. Custom s. There can be no possible problem under this head because Aden has always been treated as a foreign port in the administration of the customs lav/ in all other jjarts of British India and will merely continue to be so treated. All that will ha_pen will be that the provision of/\ oi the Sea Customs Act declaring Aden to be a foreign port will have become otiose. Stamps and Excis e. These taxes are so local in character that there should be no problem arising out of separation. It will only be necessary to safeguard the validity of acts done before separation, e.g., the admissibility of instruments relating to Aden which were lawfully stamped elsewhere in British India before separation. • Opium and Dangerous Drugs . So far as revenue is concerned, the position is the same as with other excises. So far as the adherence to international agreements is concerned, it is, of course, sale to assume that the ’’Colonial Office 11 will maintain all the obligations that we have ourselves accepted, and the only point to be mentioned is that we should be able to claim vis-a-v is the rest of the world that after separation we are entitled to continue to supply opium to Aden, if Aden desires to have it, on exactly the same footing as at present. The Secretary of State has already reached a similar decision as regards the continued supply of opium from India to Burma after separation m the event of Burma’s requiring it (see paragraph 3 of Secretary of State’s Despatch, Public No.31, dated the 5th May, 1932). Yours sincerely, (SD.) A.H.Lloyd. G.H.Baxter, Esq., Financial Secretary, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1Political Secretary : In the light of the settlements which v/e have recently effected “between Orissa, Sind and their four parent provinces, and of the Amery Tribunal f s scheme for Burma, which the Secretary of State has adopted, the present proposals appear prima facie suitable and, so far as the facts are available, reasonable. I consider that the Secretary of State should support them.

SubjectFinancial adjustments between India and His Male sty's Government consequent on the separation of Aden from India. &gt; Sir, I am directed to forward for information a memorandum on the financial adjustments between India and His Majesty's Government consequent on the impending separation of A^en from India and to enquire whether the secretary of State accepts its c and us ions. i have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Secretary to the Government of India. MST. 2.5.56.MSMORAMtlfl RELATING TO TEE FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS ON TH E SEPARATION OF ADEN FROM INDIA. • • • • By Section 288 of the Government of India Act Aden is to be separated from India. The first part of sub-section (5) of that Section has much the same import as that of Section 448(1) and (2) which applies to Burma. But where as in the case of Burma there is Section 452 of the Act contemplating a financial adjustment between India and Burma to compensate for any possible unfairness on account of this inevitable division of property and on account of other factors, there is no corresponding clause relating to Aden. However, this omission can hardly affect the proposition that if a financial adjustment between India and His Majesty’s Government consequent on the separation of Aden is equitable, it should be effected. 2. The report of the Indo-Burma Tribunal has now provided a model for the financial adjustments to be undertaken when a country is split up into two parts. But where one of the parts is so small relative to the other as is the case of Aden compared with India, it would be supererogatory to apply all the niceties necessary in the separation of Burma from India. 3. When His Majesty’s Government took over the military control of Aden, the concerned buildings were transferred free of cost. This was in consonance with the practice and conceptions of the Government of India at the time. It has been assumed in past correspondence regarding the separation of Aden that civil buildings would be similarly handed over to His Majesty’s Government free of cost. But if, in view of the new conceptions forced on them by the report of the Indo-Burma Tribunal, a financial adjustment ought to be forthcoming on account of such assets as buildings,mm0 - 2 - buildings, then the Government of India would be justified in going back on their previous opinion so far as civil buildings are concerned. The report of the Tribunal on this point, however, does not merely mean that Aden should pay India for the buildings in Aden any more than it means that India should pay Aden for the buildings in India. The report lays down that buildings come into the picture as an asset when calcui lating the balance of liabilities over assets. Aden ought to assume responsibility for a small fraction of the uncovered debt liability of India. Against this Aden ou^it to get credit for the fact that there is not in Aden a corresponding fraction of the dead assets of the Government of India. 4. It would, however, suffice in the case of Aden if His Majesty’s Government reimbursed the Government of India for (a) obligations of the nature of debt specifically referable to Aden at the date of separation, and (b) some portion of the pensionary liabilities arising out of Aden. 5. The formerly Indian military land in Aden was made over to the War Office subject to the two following conditions (a) the lands were to revert to the Government of India in the event of their ceasing to be utilised for military purposes, and (b) the Government of India was to provide the War Office free of cost with any land in Aden which , might subsequently be required by the War Office in connection with the defence of Aden. These two conditions will naturally lapse upon the separation/4£' - 4 - | W V The present currency chest of the Reserve Bank of India at Aden will be closed and its contents brought back to India. 7. The item of Rs.5 lakhs above is the outstanding balance of a loan of Rs.lG lakhs drawn in 1925-26 by the Aden Settlement Fund for an electric supply project. The loan is at present carrying a rate of interest of per cent. The local authority maintains an invested sinking fund for the eventual repayment of this debt* Its annual contribution to the fund is about Rs.45j0C0f In December 1933 the balance in the sinking fund was just over Rs.50 ,000. 8, In regard to the Posts and Telegraphs department there are certain adjustments to be taken into account. The capital account of that department corresponds to an identi fiable item in the public debt of India. The figures for Aden on 31st March 1935 were - Capital outlay (i.e. depreciated value of assets as on 1st April 1925 plus cost value subsequently):- (1) Post Office buildings at Steamer Point, Aden and Khomaksar 1.55 (2) Aden telephone exchange 1*57 Less depreciation Net 3.12 r!9 2.93 This sum would be due by Aden to India. (The figures exclude the value of land as this is not borne on the block). 9. Other items under Posts and Telegraphs which would require adjustment, as they stood on 31st March 1935, are - (a) Savings Bank Deposits. Rs. 4.48 lakhs. (The Government of India will be responsible for any Indian savings bank accounts dead before the date of separation). (b) Provident Fund deposits. Rs. .15 M (c) Cash in the hands of Postmasters Rs. .19 w The first two items would stand to the debit of Aden and /k*-t 5 1 r z 15 p 1 ' !?y&gt; the last to its credit. That is, between them they constitute a liability of value Rs.4.44 lakhs. Any balance of unpaid foreign money orders outstanding on the date of separation would also have to be adjusted. The amount will be small. It was only about Hs.450 on 31st March 1935. The clearance of certain suspense heads (which show a credit of about Rs.4,750 to Aden on 31st March mi^it also involve adjustable items. 10. For the following elements, presumably adjustments will have periodically to be done through an exchange account and in consequence they need not be considered as coming into the separation question - Payment of Indian Post Office Cash Certificates Money orders with India Receipts and payments on account of Indian CJL Postal life insurants. 11. The pensionary liabilities of Aden fall into the following categories - (a) pensions in issue on the date of separation for service wholly in Aden (i) payable in Aden, and (ii) payable in India or elsewhere. (b) pensions in issue outside Aden on the date of separation covering jiui-fr tinna part time service in Aden, (c) future pensions arising out of whole time service in Aden, (d) future pensions arising out of part time service (whether before or after separation) in Aden. Of these, in the civil class, Aden will continue to disburse (a)(i) amounting at present to about Rs. 17,000 a year. (There is one pensioner who never served Aden drawing a pension from the Aden Treasury. The commuted value of his pension on 31st March 1935 was about Rs.3,650 and Aden would be due to obtain a credit for this sum). Aden will naturally become respon sible for (c). Aden should in future meet the part of (d) on the basis of length of service referable to service in Aden. Theres 14 * ’ - 6 - There is no practical manner of apportioning (b) and Aden will have to be exonerated from bearing any share of that 0 class. Class (a) covers mainly subordinate personnel. As regards (a)(ii), five pensioners of the Aden Police department have been identified who draw their pensions at Barabera in Somaliland. Their charge amounts to about Rs. 1,000 a year. After separation Aden will bear this debit direct. Five other persons drawing pensions in India for whole time service in Aden have been identified. The commuted value of the pensions drawn V these as on 31st March 1935 is about Rs.56,000. This sum would be debitable to Aden in a financial settle ment upon separation. 12. As regards pensions arising out of the Posts and Telegraphs department in Aden, any which were sanctioned before 1st April 1921 would appear among civil pensions. It is unlikely that any which matter exist now. For the rest, only four pensioners have so far been discovered. One person is drawing a pension of Rs.37-11 a month in Aden for whole time service in Aden. Aden after separation will be responsible for this. Another is drawing a pension in Aden of Rs.115-2 a month althou^i he did not spend his whole service there. Aden would obtain a credit for the capita lised amount of his pension ascribable on a time basis to his service out of Aden. Two other pensioners have been found in India who 9 spent their whole service in the Posts and Telegraphs department in Aden. The capitalised value of their pensions on 31st March 1935 was about Rs.l5,30C which would be a debit in a financial settlement to Aden. 13. If, particularly in the Posts and Telegraplis depart ment, personnel to serve in Aden cannot be obtained from the present services and in consequence the Government of India have to abolish some posts and pay compensation to individuals thereby, the compensation element would be due to be debited to the account of Aden.-7- 14. ■ The sunmary (In Rs. laJchs) of the Items mentioned above Is as foliows;- Llabllltles bv Aden to India 9 paragrajh 6 1,01 8 E.93 11 .56 12 .15 •] Liabiliti es by India to Aden paragraph 9 4.44 11 .04 ' 3'.48 Net amount due to India Ss. .17 lakhs. 15. if the cash balance in the treasuiy is above the normal figure on the date of separation, the difference will be taken to the currency chest, under the terms of the Aden Settlement Fund loan India can claim nothing from the sinking fund before the date of separation. The amount of actual cash adjustment as on the date of separation is not likely to be a figure out of order with the figure at the end of the last paragraph, in view of the fact that as an outcome of separation India will save (according to the 1935-36 budget figures) fc. 16 lakhs a year on the military tudget alone, it is not worth while India’s demanding payment of such a relatively small sum as this, it will therefore not be necessary to recalculate the position as on the actual date of separation. But it will be well to render the account set out in this nsmorandum as a record of the sums involved, and so that His Majesty's Government and % departments of the Government of India, and especially the '/ Accounts department, may understand the position. 16. it may then be laid down that all pensions in issue in Aden on the date of separation will be bome by Aden, while pensions payable in India which cover whole time or part time service in Men will be bome by India. Any pensions payable outside India or Aden for whole time service in Men will be home8 •• borne by Aden which will however be relieved from bearing any share of such pensions if they cover only part time service in Aden. Pensions sanctioned after separation will be allocated between Aden and India on the basis of length of service.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000029_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1506</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000029</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1506</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/69 'Aden.
