I understand tfcmt owing to the unsatisfactory attitude which until recently the Shaikh of Has al Khaiiaah had adopted towards us, ,ij&amp;er ^rkaLa ^fusing to c all on Political Officers oaf His 14ajssty 9 s Ships, the latter have instructions not to visit Has al Khaiaah. 2. The Shaikh has recently changed his attitude to a friendly one and has written to me saying thatjhe will call on the next Ship L that visits him. In these circumstances I would request that the loop that is taking Captain Cole on tour in the middle of this month to the Trucial Coast should call at Has al Khalmah to test whether the Shaikh is as good as his word* I do not think, however, tint before / | s.e.

LINDIA OFFICE, ?. 2. 3521/35 HR MAIL. No. LONDON, S.W.l. 3rd June 1935. We were interested to read your express letter 336-S of 2?th April and the enclosures to your printed letter No.C/132 of 11th May about the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and the proposal to send a Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologist to explore the oil possibilities of his Sheikhdom and we were very glad to see that the Sheikh is showing a tendency to adopt a more friendly attitude towards us. We assume in this connexion that you will take steps, if necessary, to ensure that any geologist who may be sent to Ras-al-Khaimah is in fact a British subject. We impressed on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that we attached importance to British subjects being employed on work of this kind on the Trucial Coast in connexion with the recent visit of Messrs./ k Hor % f ble Lt. Col. T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., H.B.M. Consulate-General, Bushire.f 2. Messrs. Cox and Williamson to Abu Dhabi and I mentioned the matter to Lefroy the other day a propos of Ras-al-Xhaimah, but it might be as well for you to take precautions at your end if you think it necessary. I gathered from Lefroy that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were not likely to send a man of their own to Ras-al-Khaimah. If the Iraq Petroleum Company proposed to send a man, he might not be a British subject. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and to Cole. (S'l.) J. a WALTON.Translation of letter.

When I visited Has al ^hainah tue *^naikii asked for a geologist to visit him. I told the ^hakh that a visit before the winter was highly Improbable due to tne heat but that you were doing your best to find a geologist to come at once. From my conversation with the ^h&amp;ikh I am quite sure that a cursory look round at the present w.ta a promise of a more extensive visit later ail he wants. Knowing this and tne views of the Anglo- renien Oil Company as contained in Muhammeraii telegram ho 11400/2 dated the 2nd J uly 1935 I wrote the above mentioned demi-ofl cial letter to the Senior Naval Officer. ±he Senior Naval Officer informs me that this letter expresses v.ews contrary to your wish.

'SHOREHAM' No. D.0 I .'545. at Bahrain, 15th July, 1935. (3b) 3 y' Dear QJU With reference to your C/401 of 14th July, I have referred, as you sug/estod^/to the Honourahle the political Resident's telegram Nd.606. I am of opinion that the proposed arrangements in paragraph 2 of your letter are contrary to paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Political Resident's telegram, which were designed as a gesture to show that we are treating the Shaikh's request for a geologist in all seriousness. I gathered in discussion with Colonel Fowle that he contemplated that the geologist would go up into the hills on 3 or 4 days. J. 2 1 .- Paragraph 3 of Political Resident's 606 and paragraph 3 of your letter are not compatible. With reference to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's telegram to you via H.M. Consul, Ahwaz, dated 2nd July, conditions for prospecting are stated to be impossible. In view of the fact that Mr. Cox of the Anglo-lranian Company carried out a survey of the ground at Abu Dhabi in December, 1934, it is presumed that he considered then the possibilities of oil. Having regard to the above I am not prepared to sanction the extension of 'LUPIN'S' visit to Ras al Khaimah to cover Debai and Abu Dhabi on what would appear to be a futile visit; and for which no arrangements have already been made. 3.- I do not consider, even if a proper survey of the ground could be carried out, that such could be conducted by geologists landing and embarking daily from one of H.M. Sloops. Too mucht time would be wasted in such an operation on the Trucial Coast, and I do not wish sloops to remain at anchor there for any length of time in the present season. 4.- I should therefore be glad if existing arrangements could stand. I shall be happy to provide a sloop to take geologists to Debai and Abu Dhabi at longer notice and at a more suitable time of the year. iin g.A. Cole, ie Agency, Bahrain.

Captain, Officiating Political agent, Bahrain.Note On the btfc October 1935 I arrived in the early morning at Has al Khaimah. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and his nephew Humaid bin Muhammad and his son 3al im came to call in a motor launch shortly after H«M.S« Lupin had anchored. I returned the call a few minutes after he left. There is a short walk of a couple of hundred yards or so from the beach to the Shaikh* s fort but no difficulties arose. The Shaikh received me on the stairs of the Tower in which we sat but on the conclusion of my visit accompanied me to the beach. 2. As this was my first visit to Ras al Khairaah no real business was discussed nor indeed was there anything of importance to discuss. 3 . &lt;1 yctwacd the visit at a suitable moment when the Commanding officer had gone out to take photo graphs. 4he Head Munshi handed to the ^hai^th the sum of Rs.150/- which should have been paid to him a year ago for helping Imperial Airways. 4 . On my return visit I purposely mentioned the question of calls of British India ships and a separate note is being placed 0 n that file. 5. The Shaikh gave us a number of stones which had been brought from the mountains and which he had asked us to give to the geologists at Abadan.

On the 13th October 1935 I asked Mr, Smith, Deputy Manager of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, to come and see toe at Bahrain, Cole about the possibility of British ^-ndia steamers calling at Has al Khaimah and told him that 1 had recently seen the Shaikh, The Shaikh did not want more than a single call in the month and had said that he v/ould guarantee 500 packages.paying apy deficit himself (though I do^not th nk that the Shaikh really knew what he meant when he said this) and that probably there would be considerably more than the 500, The exports were not likely to amount to much, I asked him what amount of goods the Company would be likely to consider sufficient inducement to make such a call and he said that it was difficult to say but possibly 100 tons or soy 2000 bags, I told him that the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah j intended to visit Bahrain in the course of the next few days and that I had told him that he had better &amp;o and see the British India Agent# there during his visit. I suggested to Mr. Smith that it would be wise, even if he had to tell the Shaikh that there was little * possibility of the Company calling at present, to leave the door open and not to turn it down too decidedly. I asked him to divest himself for the moment of the Chief Local Representative side of his personality and told him in confidence that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had an Exploration concession in Has al Khaimah and that it was just possible that shipping business might offer later on. Mr, smith mentioned the evacuation of Henjam 2. 1 referred to his previous discussion with Captain and / 3and said that if Henjam was to be cut off altogether it was just possible that something might be done. I said that I thought that it was possible that once the Telegraph Station was closed (he knew all about this) it might be more feasible to arrange a call at Has al Kha imah. s•s.Baroda. /t Sea. 14/10/35.

Yours sincerely,Ha lj - Extract of Report Ras-el-Khaimah is approximately seven hours by launch from Sharjah. Travel by road between Sharjah and Ras-el-Khaimah is considered unsafe. C ONNECTIONS . In the event of B.I. steamers calling at this port it would oe necessary for the ship to communicate her time of arrival at Rac-sl-Khaimah to our Dubai office through Sharjah Y/ireless Station, 3 days before her estimated time of arrival to enable the Dubai agent to pass this information on to tthe Sharjah Agent of the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah, who would in turn inform R&amp;s-el- • Khaimah by message on camel. This form of communication is necessary as one cannot always guarantee to b e able to send a message by launch as services are .fairly infrequent and to engage a special launch is a very expensive business, return trip costing Rs.100/- S ANCHORAGE. As at all gulf ports it will be necessary for the B.I. steamers to anchor well of the entrance to Ras-el-Khaimah, possibly at a distance of 6 miles. The Sheikh has, however, Coolie labour to work the ship could be supplied b' the &gt;heikh at the same rates as at present charged at Dubai. The Iheikh will convey the labourers to and from the Ship by launch at a control of several fairly large sailing boats each having a .carrying capacity of from 20 to 25 tons. labour.aoderate charge to the Company. CARGO - IMPORTS. Imports into Ras-el-Khaimah will consist mostly of rice with i certain amount of Sugar. This cargo is at present brought to tes-el-Khaimah from India tty sailing boats, but in the event &gt;f B.I.steamers calling there, to ensure that all cargo imported into Ras-el-Khaimah is carried by B. I. , the Sheikh is prepared *o place a prohibitive duty on all cargo arriving by sailing &gt;oats subsequent to the calling of B. I. steamers. At the resent moment the Custom duty at Ras-el-Khaimah, which by the fay, is controlled by the Sheikh, ranges from 4 to 5%. Cargo rould be discharged at a small pier at Ras-el-Khaimah and would be stacked in godowns handy in the event of bad weather. The Sheikh signified his agreement that he will be responsible for the safe carriage and delivery of cargo from the steamer to the shore. C ARGO- EXPORT S. The Sheikh informs us that there will be no exports from I Ras-el-Khaimah. P ASSENGERS . It is likely that the Company would be able to obtain i quite a few passengers from Ras-el-Khaimah to Dubai, Sharjah ^ and Bahrein.

The latter has been a regular port of call for a good nany years, but the former was only made a call about 5 years ago, not on commercial grounds, but - at our request - on political grounds as an inducement to the shaikh to give us the air facilities we required there for Imperial Airways. 1 don’t imagine that a third call, Ras al Khaimah, would be a paying proposition, since the Trucial Coast is a poverty-str icKen area, unless it is a paying proposition the foreign Lines mentioned by Colonel Loch will not call at Ras al Khaimah. If they do, they will only do so once a month or so, while the 3 . 1 . can follow their example and I presume cut tnem out as they can call once a week.

Theoretically they could place a discriminating duty against 3ritish goods in favour of Japanese, for instance} Probably this has not occurred to them, but if the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah begins putting on duties in one connection, the others /others may follow suit in other directions# The dhows which at present bring cargo to Ras al Khainiah, are, I think, Kuwaiti and Indian ones, and if a prohibitive duty was imposed by the Shaikh, there would I imagine be protests from Kuwait and India# I will talk this over at Bahrain with Colonel Loch, and this note should go with me on tour# I shall not want the Discussed with P.R. Mr.Wills told me that, if foreign Lines were to go to Ras al Khaimah, the 3.1. would then do so and squeeze them out.

This is second occasion within six months that Shaikh has been guilty of stud i.e. d (?) discourtesy to His Majesty 1 s Navy and I think it is necessary to consider coupling letter with threat of action if he does not offer full apology and mend his ways. 2. Possible effective sanction might be stoppage of travel papers for Shaikhs subjects to all places outside Trucial Coast. 3. What are your views to this or alter native sanction ?

I see following objections to use of threats in the proposed letter. (a) While not probable Shaikh might possibly be able to wriggle out leaving us to appear foolish if we had used threats. (b) Threats of action, relative ineffectiveness of which I fear may only be too obvious, might en courage Shaikh to be contumacious. 2. Your paragraphs 2 and 3. Only other sanctions possible are:- (i) Intimation that the Shaikh will not receive permission to import arms and ammunition. Not very effective. (ii) Attempt at economic boycott by preventing trade with Bahrain and Dubai. We think both these Shaikhs will co-operate in such boycott which however might lose much of its effect as Sharjah would not join in. If you agree Bahrain and Dubai might be sounded un officially on this at once. (iii) Most effective action would have been against pearling fleet but unfortunately the season is over. 3. As for effect on oil negotiations either oil desiderata are paramount and we must try to slur over the slight to Navy or we must ignore oil in taking all possible steps to maintain prestige. Clearly latter should prevail, in spite of possible ineffectiveness of action proposed. - Political -i&lt;yo Telegram G.T.C. From Residency Agent, Sharjah. Political Agent, Bahrain. To No. Nil.

The Shaikh said that although he promised to write the letter, on second thought, he had changed his mind. He said that he did not want to commit himslef like the past case. He emphasised the fact that he did not do any wrong but was not treated properly on board H.M.S.Shoreham.

Subject* Failure of the Shaikh of Has al Kha imah to call on H.M.S.Deptford. I have discussed with Secretary, who thinks that it would have been better to proceed aa on page 20, but feels that as we nave asked for an expression of regret tne case must now be pressed to action if necessary. 2. The possible forms which action could take are (i) withdrawal of visa facilities (ii) against pearlii^ fleet in due course (iii) withdrawal of salute and no more visits by sloops to Has al Khaiinah. (iii) and possibly (ii) would require reference to the India Off ice. 5. As regards oil this ought not to weigh against prestige, and in any case cupidity will have its way in the long run. And present indications are not in favour of rapid or successful developments in the area of this Shaikh- dom. 4. I still think that Has al Khniaah* s past attitude (cf. particularly the warning administered to him after his removal from Kalba - a warning from His Majesty’s Government direct), and naval feeling in this matter, make it necessary to extract an expression of regret, and to act if it cannot be obtained. But before proceeding further I shall be glad if Captain Galloway, who is shortly to visit all the Trucial Shaikhdoma in the normal course, will take the opportunity of discussing the case with the Shaikh. It is possible, though unlikely in view of the Shaikh’s character, that he might be persuaded in the course of friendly talk to offer his/-2 his regrets without any necessity for his losing face. It might be pointed out to him that there is no desire to repeat the dose administered at the time of the Kalba incident, and that is why we have hitherto raised the matter personally and orally. And e reminder of the varning previously given be timely. Ho specific threats should be uttered, as I am un willing to commit Sir Trenchard Fowle to any particular course of action, but it can be stated that warnings previously administered make it impossible to leave the matter as it is. The matter of substantial importance is that we should be assured that discourtesies will not be repeated on future occasions• 5. If, as is possible, the Shaikh goes out of his way to avoid a meeting, Captain Galloway should not pursue or press him, but should merely report the fact. But I see no reason why he should not mention the case to the Shaikh 1 a brother, » though on this point he should consult the Residency Agent. 6. The telegram below should issue to Political Agent. 7. A copy of this note should be given to Captain Galloway.Telegram — G.T.C.

Ships. On being asked if that was only reason he reiterated his side of Kalba question. I said this was rather beside the point as past was past to which he replied if Political Resident addressed him he would state what he had in mind. I made no reply which concerned Political Resident’s movement. The Sheikh expressed himself as being on friendlies terms with Government and said members of his family would always be ready to visit H.M. Ships. 3 3. I came to the conclusion with which Resi dency Agent agreds that Sheikh wishes to use calling question as a peg from which to air a grievance about Kalba and that having lost Kalba roundly he is deter mined not to lose this and has not intentionally called on H.M.

Having regard to the distance which some of the^rucial Coastis* have to travel in order to get to the Residency Agent at Sharjah there is no harm in thfcs practice.

Your Honour has pointed out that I did not show any courtesy to His Majesty 1 s lj avy. I am very sorry for this expression as my only belief and aim and chief object is to respect His Majesty the Ring of Great Britain and his Represen tatives and to consider myself as one of his loyal friends. As to the first instance, my reply is that I was at Sharjah where 1 had some special business as I have already informed you. I interviewed the Senior Haval Qffi cer and informed him verbally that if there was any important affair I was ready to comply with it whether I was here or in my own town. H e replied in the negative. I had no object whatr ever in this. As to the second time I was not present when the ship arrived and my brotner did what was necessary for the reception of the snip s visit. I felt it when I saw that you have mentioned at the end of your letter that you do not see any reason for continuing your assistance to me. 0* my respected friend. Nothing of any sort has happened which necessitates such action as I have been and will remain as a friend who observes the treaty relations which bind me vith His Majesty. It is a very strange matter which is not expected from a man like you who is known for his scrutiny and investigation in all affairs and everything, and for his patience and sound judgment. I trust that you will reconsider the order of stopping the travel documents and that you will realize that there is no need to treat in this manner an old friend who is bound by2 friendly relations with Great Britain since the time of his fathers and ancestors. 1 am confident that iA our Honour will be good to me and that in future I will be afforded the assistance which is expected from you.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your memorandum No.l73-S dated 11th March 1938 on the subject of the relations between the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah and the Muscat Government. 2. On my return to Muscat early this month, I took the first opportunity of approaching the Sultan^ verbally Representative/on this subject. He feigned complete ignorance of the visi t of the Walis of Sohar and Shinas to Ras al Khaimah in January last, but from his i demeanour it was clear thathe was not speaking the truth. He statedthat it was possible that the visit was purely a friendly one but added that hew ould write to the Walis concerned and instruct them to refer in future all matters effecting them and any of the Trucial Shaikhs to the Muscat Government for passing on to this Agency and the proper authorities. Though he did not state in so many words that the action of the Walis was incorrect his promise to write a letter to them in the sense mentioned is clearly a tacit admission of it being so. 3. The Representative went on to say that owing to the Sultan reserving to himself the conduct of all questions effecting. effecting foreign affairs he requested that the matter be taken up personally with the Sultan on the latter*s return to Muscat. I can see no objection to this action and if you approve I shall mention the subject to the Sultan at a suitable opportunity when he is back again in Muscat.

The Shaikh said that he wanted time to think over the matter. I then fixed with him to dine with me at Dubai on the evening of the 17th May. In the morning on 17th he sent his motor car to Has al Khaimah and brought Muhammad al Rakir and in the evening brought him with him for dinner* After food he asked all his men to go out, except Muhammad al Bakir, and I talked over the natter with him again. He promised to write the letter and will bring it with him in the morning* I stayed the night at Dubai and in the morning the shaikh brought the two letters with him. In the letter to the Senior Nval Officer he added that he wrote to the Hon f ble the Political Resident about the cause of his being afraid but I asked him to omit that from the letter to which he agreed and changed the letter in the fom required by the Political Resident© 4. As the Shaikh had come to terms and wrote the letter of apology, it wp»uld now be in the interest of His Majesty’s Government policy if he gets a suitable reply which will give him no ground to doubt anything© a5 I beg to suggest that it would be better if sloops do not visit Ras al Khaimah for the next two months unless the Honourable the Political Resident or the Political Agent are on board.

After Compliments, Your Honour l in compliance with your desire and in obedience to your order, I have written the letter to the Senior Naval Officer which is enclosed herewith. I should like to bring to Your Honour's attention the fact that I still feel afraid of boarding the sloops on account of what had happened to me. As I am very anxious to be on good terms and friendliness with His tejesty's Government, I, with the object of being sure that nothing of this kind would happen to me, appeal to Your Honour to remove the doubt's which X have in ray mind by giving me an assurance, either verbally by meeting you or by letter, I Jjave confidence in the British Honour.

Reference correspondence resting with my Printed letter No. C/299-1.a/37 dated the 9th May 1938. 2. I enclose herewith a copy of a confidential memo randum No. C/364-23/1 dated the 19th May 1938 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, together with its enclosures. I take it that the letter of apology from the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah to the Senior Naval Officer may be accepted, even though it may not be a particularly elaborate apology. I will retain the actual letter here pending instructions from you to hand it over to the Senior Naval Officer. 3. As this apology has now been received I should like to include Has al Khaimah in my Trucial Coast Cruise. Not only do I want to meet the Shaikh, but this will afford an opportunity for the Shaikh to go on board a sloop while I am present; and also we may perhaps go some way towards ^ fT /f. r i meeting the suggestion made in the 4th paragraph of the Residency Agent*s memorandum. If you approve, I might say to the Shaikh in the presence of the Senior Naval Officer that you are surprised that he should even think of asking for an assurance of proper treatment when he went on board one of His Majesty*s sloops; but that I have your authority for saying that he has nothing whatsoever to fear provided he does not interfere with the affairs of other Shaikhdoms (as he did at Kalba) and provided he conducts himself in Wo a/-a loyal manner towards His Majesty's Government and observes his Treaties and Engagements fully and genuinely. 4. As there will not be time for reply by mail before I leave for the Trucial Coast I would request that if you app rove of the suggestions made in this letter you will tele graph your approval. letter of apology the ban on Has al Khaimah travel papers will of course be lifted. It is then possible that the Shaikh will apply to me personally for papers to visit Kuwait, Basrah and Syria, and the question is whether these should be granted or not. We have reason to suspect that his object is to discuss oil with Major Holmes and Haji Abdullah Williamson and it is a moot point whether we derive the greater advantage by refusing to allov/ him to go to Kuwait and Basrah at all, thereby giving him cause for complaint which he mi^ht be able to exploit; or whether it would be better to allow him to go, but for me quite openly and definitely to say that I hear his object is as above and it may save him and everyone else a lot of trouble if I make it quite plain that he need not expect to be able to evade His Majesty's Government's 'P.C.L. or none” ultimatum. Personally I am inclined to think that the latter is the better alternative. 5. There is one other question.

To my opening statement that the action of the tfalie of hohar and chinas in having dealing direct with the 3hei*h of Bas al Khaimah *as in violation of the undertaking entered into between the -crucial herhhs and His Majesty* s Government whereby Uit. a v &gt;a tign relations or t^AOse Gtates should be conducted through the British authorities, the Sultan said he was not aware officially of any such undertaxing. He admitted that he xnew of the existence of such Treaties but declared that he m required the fact to be brought to his notice formally preferably by both His kajcsty's Goveriuaent and each of the Trucrai SheiKhs concerned but certainly by the latter. I replied that to the beat of my xnoiiedge it was never the international custom *hen Wo countries entered into a Treaty for them to inform other countries of the fact officiary and in a^ case I * aB no*, under instructions from you, bringing 1 have had several Xatigtjajf discussions with the the existence of the Treaties to his notice airi requesting him to© ■ 2 ' to order hie oiXioiale not to violate them. 3 # The Sultan answered that he could not comply lor two main reasons (a} if he endeavoured to enforce such an order he would be in effect breaking a time honoured cue tom (b) that though he no doubt could extract obedience in ouch a matter from the Valia of the two places mentioned who were under his control he certainly *&lt;ould not be able to do in the oaee of otner «ai.ie and tne oheixha of the tribes wnose districts were contiguous to tnat of the iruoiai Cman* The inhabitants of all these regions* the Sultan pointed out* were closely related by ties of blood* similar sectarian beliefs and speech and they regarded themselves to a large extent as belonging* certainly to the same race* often some to the same tribe though^mlght be subjects of the Truoial sheuchdoms and others of the Muscat Government* For centuries* the Sultan went on to say* these people had maintained constant intercourse with each other and such problems as grazing and water rights* arrest of fugitive robbers and trade matters had invariably been settled direct by the Sheixhs and Headmen concerned on each side with* out reference to the *uscat Government. Any attempt by him to prevent his subjects in these regions following these customs of their fathers would* the guitan asserted* be certain to fall and he added he could see no real necessity* in a^lte of the treaties* to interfere with matters such as tne one complained of which waataH* should be beneficial to all parties concerned. In ail big questions of course such as a boundary dispute or any sort of a quarrel arising between his subjects and those of the irucial dheixhs the Muscat Government would* the Sultan declared, at once approach His majesty’s Government. 4 * In the present case the bneixh of Has al xhaimah was* according to the Sultan* equally to blame with hie *&amp;lis in discussing the matter with them and if it was desired that all direct intercourse between his subjects and the Crucial dheixhs3- Sheiichs should oease, Uxen said His Highness, he snould like &amp; the latter themselves taice action and inform him accordingly) fN xu tJriat everit it might be his ^eo^le conform, c The Sultan is no doubt wrong though it seems to be that there is something to be said for certain of his argu ments bearing always in mind tne fact that as he himself admits, in nearly all the regions of the north of the huitanate which border u^on the Trucial ShaiKhdoms his authority and control is nominal* It appears to me that it is *oint for consideration wnether in view of the peculiar circumstances of the situation it might not be sufficient to ensure perhaps by exchange of letters with the Sultan that ail important questions, such as those mentioned 3 above, arising between his subjects arxi those of the Trucial Shaikhs should be referred to His Majesty's Government for settlement. t/hp isst Liortion of 1 have the honour to be Your most obedient servant sd.

Memorandum® I beg to infom you that on the evening of 15th January 1939, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah called on me at the Agency. He said to me that the present state of the Trucial Shaikhs was hopeless owing to the bedouins who do not respect the authority of their respective Shaikhs. He said that it would be in the interests of the Trucial Shaikhs if they were to unite against the bedouins and prevent all evils resulting from their activities. This, he said, was necessary at the present time for the purpose of protecting the Shaikhs’ common interests -md facilitate the work of the oil Company. He said that he would take upon himself the trouble of convincing all the Shaikhs to enter into such agreement, but that he was not sure of his success unless he was helped by the Residency Agent on behalf of the British Government. I said to the Shaikh that if other Shaikhs consider the agreement to be in their interests they would sign it without hesitation and there would be no necessity for the Residency Agent to take part i-u. ai _l anging it© x then asked the Shaikh to give me a copy in writing of his proposed agreement, so that I may forward it to you.

That when such an agreement is signed by all of them they can give us copy for our information and record without our being a party to it. I added that the present draft agreement puts the whole burden on the British Government and . ould create lot of complications for them with the Trucial Shaikhs. The Shaikh said that the Shaikhs would not be afr- id -rom each other but that a mere letter from the Governmnet would bring the Shaikh responsible for breach of his undertaking to his senses. I said that# the letter from the Government could not have a force unless it smelt gun-powder(supported by force) and I could not see the -round why the British Government should take the place of the Shaikhs ana face all difficulties in a matter which is purely in the interests of the Shaikhs. 4 - The object of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah is to tne ' est# Oj. the Trucial Shaikhs and the British Government to help him and his cousin, the Shaikh of Sharjah, against the bedouins who do not admit their authority. ing each other against tha bedouin activities they could do so Resi^ency Agent,SharjahConfidential No. C/72-1.a/37 Political Agency, Bahrain, 3rd February 1939 To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, On board H.M.S. Deptford Memorandum I enclose herewith copies of memoranda No. C/38 dated the 19th January 1939 and C/61 dated the 24th January 1939 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah. 2. In regard to the former, I trust I shall have an opportunity a little later on of ascertaining how genuine the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah may be in his wish to 'remove all past misunderstanding'. 3. In regard to the second memorandum, the common object the Shaikhs ox k as al Khaimah and Sharjah is to lure the other ^racial Coast Shaikhs into an alliance directed against the inland tribes, such as the Beni Kitab, over whom they claim suzerainty. Hence Shaikh Sultan bin Salim*s anxiety to obtain our blessing for an ostensibly admirable union. I instructed the Hesidency Agent to inform the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah that I was not interested in draft agreements and should in no case invite the Political Resident to become 'surety' for the observance by the Shaikhs of an agreement between themselves, but that I should certainly be interested if the Shaikhs produced an agreement binding themselves to mutual aid against bedouin depredations such as kidnapping helpless goatherds or wood-gatherers from their territories.- 2 - 4* The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah is of course concerned at the decline of his prestige and authority in the hinterland, e.g. in the Wadi Qaur; and the main object of the Shaikh of Sharjah is to reduce the Beni Kitab; while both of them I believe are nervous of Shaikh Khalid. As I mentioned in para graph 12 of my Diary 2 relations between Sharjah and Hira are somewhat severely strained at the moment and the Shaikh cf ira has invited Shaikh Khalid to stay at Hira whenever he likes* Were Shaikh Khalid to accept this invitation I should assess the likelihood of the present Shaikh of Sharjah sur viving as a fairly poor chance. 5. In brief, the intrigues in which Sharjah and Ras al Kha Imah have been indulging in the past few months are now having a boomerang effect, and this accounts for their anxiety to form a 'League of Nations' on the Trucial Coast.

Two. points in particular arii from this communication. J. V''} (i) It seems to me in the highest degree improper for the /all of Sohar, KudhafSr bin Sulaiman, to have written to the Shaikh of has pi Khaimah in the terms used in his letter of the 26th4uharram 1358. That letter appears to indicate that the Muscat Government is prepared to attack and take the Wadi al Qaur unless the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah takes certain action. Whether or not His Highness the Sultan of Muscat was on good ground in the arguments quoted in the Political Agent Muscat’s letter Ho. C/183 dated the 28th November 1938 on this subject, there ^an certainly be no justification for one of his Walls tq' issue a threat of this nature; and I trust it will be possible to draw His Highness the oultan’s serious attention to the impropriety of this communication.(ii) As I have reported elsewhere, vide the enclosure to my confidential letter No. c/546 dated the 24th August 1938, the ohaikh of Has al Khaimah is no longer in control of the Wadi al Qaur and it would not be unreasonable to presume that the Shaikh has seised on this letter from the Wuli of .johar as an admirable opportunity for eliciting an incautious statement from us on which he might base a claim for aid against Shaikh Khalid of Kalba. The nature of the reply to be made to him depends, as I see it, on the communi- cation to be made to the Sultan of Muscat and the latter's reaction. Since the course of the previous correspondence has indicated quite clearly that Muscat recognises the wadi al Qaur as Jawassim/ property, whether it be las al Khaimah or Kalba which in point of fact exercises authority, the Sultan Presumably cannot do otherwise than disapprove of the action of the Wali of Sohar; and in that event it will only be necessary to inform the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah that he need take no notice of the iVall's letter.

At an interview I had with His Highness on the 6th of May he re-opened the question of the conduct of the v/ali of Sohar in regard to the V/adi al Q,aur and the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah. The Sultan stated that he received a letter from the Wali of Sohar of the 30th of April informing him that he (the Wali) had been informed that the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah had taken possession of the whole of the Wadi. The Wali stated that he proposed to proceed to the Wadi al Qiaur and investigate the situation and should the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah have entered Muscat limits to take such action as the situation might demand. The Sultan sent a special messenger by car with orders to the Wali not to go to the Wadi in person but to send a reliable messenger who would return and report on the position.

The subjects of the letters were to the effect that the Qawasin had sold the country to the British. By saying they sold, he presumably means the Concession given to the Oil Company. He used the word sold in and order to incite/ instigate them so as to prevent motor cars and agitate them. The sole aim being to cause insjirrection, instigate trouble and incite them* There had existed between us and his forefathers and ancestors pledges, union, good and firm ties of *iendship. They undertook kot to interfere in anything nor instigate trouble in the area north of Khatm Malahah. T&amp;is action on his (sultan's) part is against the frinndly ties and an infringement of the good neighbourhood relations and also a breach of the undertakings gi^ven by his ancestors. Sultan Sa'id should have promoted and preserved those rights and undertakings which were followed.)by his forefathers* We do not think that he would be fortunate by instigating insurrection, inciting the_ people and having bad intentions.

The answer is that I am quite certain that His Highness would never commit himself in such a way. The mere fact that the statement was alleged to have been in writing is in my opinion sufficient to cause very grave doubt regarding the source of Sheikh Khalid’s information. The Sultan strongly suspects our friend Sultan bin Salim of Has al Khaimah of being up to no good.

The position is that he steadily refuses to go and call aboard a sloop as he pretends that he is afraid that he would be arrested and brought to Bahrain (as happened once in the past when he interfered at Kalba). I have on two occasions tried to get him to resume calls on board the sloops by sending word in advance that I myself would be on board and would have various matters to discuss with him on return call on him ashore. It seemed to me that this made it fairly plain that he would not be seized directly he set foot aboard the sloop. However he still demands an undertaking in writing that he will not be arrested if he goes aboard and we have hitherto held that this is a totally unreasonable and improper request. 3. As you remark he is most eccentric y and he does his best to cause trouble up and down the Coast. He is dlsllk* and /- ►urable Major C.G. Prior, C.I.B. t Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.and despised by other Shaikhs, and my personal feeling is that it would be better to leave him alone until he does agree some day to call aboard sloops in a proper manner* I admit it seems improbable that he will have an opportunity for some considerable time to come, so possibly you may think he should be permitted to call on you at the ?ort at Sharjah, though he should not in that case receive a return call.

I note that in Sheikh Khalid‘s letter dated the 10th Jamad al Thani 1358, which formed an enclosure to your letter of August the 10th, 1939, there is mention of the place as 'Khatm”. Lorimer is silent on the subject of 'Mishmal' and ,f Al Khatma' but refers to ,, Khatam ,, at page 1032 of Volume second, 1908 edition. If the correct spelling of this v/ord is Khatam then apparently the letter from Sultan Said bin Sultan dated the 27th Rajab 1268 is in the nature of an agreement regarding territory to the South West of Baraimi.

A new Manager (Mr. Larkin) was appointed by the Calcutta Head Office, where he /he* &gt; I i r- 21 . 22 . he had been in charge of the reorganisation of the Gulf services. He assured me that the proposal that B.T ships should visit Has al Khaimah had never been broached to the Directors, and must have been turned down without reference. I told him that I thought it would be well worth * r essts Yackinnon Yackenzie T s time to make enquiries onthe spot before rejecting the request. T aiso told him that possible future oil and Airways developments would make it well worth the Company T s t me to consider extensions and developments on the Arab Coast now before others (and possibly non-British Companies did so). I told Mr Larkin that he could expect every helpshnd assistance from the Political authorities in the Gulf. Mr. Larkin agreed that the whole affair was well worth consideration and enquiry on the s ot and that he would make proposals to his Head Office an# to send a suitable representative ofthe Company to make enquiries in consultatior with the Political Resident and Political Agent, Bahrain.

Smith of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation limited called to see me about the possibility of a ship of the b r ptish India Steam Navigation Company Limited calling at -^as al Khaimah. He said that his head office had ordered him to go to Has al ^haimah and report on the possibility of doing so. He was very anxious not to be away from Bahrain for too long and had thought of flying down by Imperial Airways and flying back by the next plane, and visiting Has al Khaimah by motor car. I told him that one could motor down but that the road was very bad between Umm al Qaiwain and -^as al Khaimah and that there was no reliable motor car available, except that belonging to the Shaikh of which wras too good for such a purpose. I said that I would ask the Air Officer Commanding, ^ritish forces in ^raq, if it was possible to give him a lift to H as al ^haimah during some practice flight. Issue d.o to Air S ommo dore Gossage.

An account of the incident written by Agnew is contained on folio 118.The correspondence also discusses a number of other issues including Shaikh Salim's desire for a steamer to regularly visit Ra's al Khaymah, the possibility of a geologist visiting Ra's al-Khaymah and his relations with Muscat.The file also contains a limited amount of correspondence from Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo, a Bahraini merchant who acted as an intermediary between the British authorities and Shaikh Sultan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah Sultan bin Salim Āl Qāsimī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al-Khaimah</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002de#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
