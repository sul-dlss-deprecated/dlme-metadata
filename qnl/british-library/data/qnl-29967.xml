TEHERAN, 2fth April, 1948. f 0 AIR ATTACHE’S FORTNIGHTLY INTBLLIGj 2:0E SU. I ARY No. 7 FOR PERIOD 22nd MARCH to 18th APRIL, 1948 SECRET PERSIAN’ AIR FfRCE 1. As forecast in para.l of the last Sujranary, Brigadier MO HANNA was appointed to ooimnand the Air Force early in April. A personality note will be found at Appendix ’A ! . His appointment has not aroused a great deal of enthusiasm in the Air Force, as he is a technical* officer and has been «ut of direct touch with the Air Force for many years. Colonel GUIIA1:SHAH is now his Deputy with Colonel RAYANDOR as Chief of Staff. Colonel SIAHPOUSH has reverted to his previous role of Chief Technical Officer. 2. During K.I.M. the Shah’s visit to MESHED over the Persian New Year holidays, two Hurricanes were detailed to fly the Royal mail from Teheran. Both aircraft returned to Teheran with damaged airscrews caused by loose stones on the Meshed landing ground. This proof of the need for rolling landing grounds not provided with prepared runways may induce the Air Force to take more urgent action. On the Shah’s return flight from Meshed to Teheran, eight Hurricanes were despatched to intercept and escort him into Teheran. Although visibility was reduced by haze and no information was available of the Royal aircraft’s exact track, height or position, and against the advice of Wing Commander Gibbs who was persuaded to lead the formation, the military authorities were firmly convinced that some divine influence would effect a rendezvous. Needless to say, the Hurricanes returned some time after the Royal aircraft had landed at Teheran. This is yet another example of wasted effort which could have been far better J| employed in training. 3. Training continues slowly and intermittently in the Hurricane Regiment. The reappearance of Brigadier Mohnnna is expected to result in changes in command «f the various Regiments and Squadrons, and it is already clear that the new Head of the Air Force is likely to popularise himself by appointing his friends irrespective of their merit. 4 # it is prrbable that six Hurricanes will be sent to AHWAZ on a mobility exercise. An advance party fcf ground staff and spares will be sent by train, and when they are prepared to accept the aircraft, the six Hurricanes will fly down in formation preceded by three Ansons earrying further staff and equipment. Judging from the time which has already elapsed since this plan was mooted, it is obvious that in an emergency the so-called Hurricane Mobile Squadron would not live up to its name. 5 # On the 23rd March a Hind taxying on the SHIRAZ landing ground collided with another parked Hind, resulting in major damage to both aircraft. When the Air Attache visited Shiraz on the 2nd April the aircraft had not been moved, and the accident was regarded as an amusing interlude in the otherwise eventless lives of the local Air Fo-rce detachment. 6 # Further to para.l of Summary No .5, it is now understood that the Americans have agreed to meet the additional expense in connection with the packing and transporting of the military material to be supplied under the American credit. The material is expected to begin to arrive in about two months time.■M sfT) i r* - t ’ ' O U J f - 2 - !94B' ' ' 7, Tha Air Attache has informod the Ministry of War ofc'the-new R«AVF% procedure for the purchase by foreign Governments of equipment from the Royal ^_Air Force and of tha financial arrangements connected v/ith the provision of braining courses in England. Briefly, the new procedure provides for the pre-payment in sterling for all purchases of equipment and lays responsibility for transport from the issuing depot upon the purchaser. Training fees for courses provided by the R.A.F. are to be paid for upon termination of the' courses, but all other charges for transport, messing, accommodation, etc, are to be paid for by the individual on the spot. 8. During the past month the Air Attache has visited the following airfields:- No change since last visit. The Department of Civil Aviation is repairing thin patches on runways and working on installation of radio aids. Despite 24 hours of continuous heavy rain, the two Wiled tarmacadam . runways were perfectly serviceable, and showed no ill effects after landing and take-off of an aircraft having an A.U.P. of 10,000 lbs. It is confirmed that the area off the runways is unusoablo, as at some points the runways are out through rising ground. / (See continuation below) • No change since last report. The general area is unchanged and rolled 1500 x 45 yd. NE/s been serviced for some timo, out from the air and more so serviceable, however, and is of Iranian Airways. At this landing ar^a is covered with six inches high, intermingled , but the so-called graded E gravelled strip has not is a little difficult to pick once on the ground. It is regularly used by the Dakotas time of the year the whole fairly sparse' grass up to with poppies. 9, Persian Air Force detachments noted during the above visits are as follows 6 Kinds and 2 Tiger Moths. 4 Hinds (2 unserviceable) and 2 Tiger Moths.

In addition, approval has boon givon for the new B.O.A.C. once weakly service with Yorks from U.K. to Abadan. This service is, in reality, provided for Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employees travelling on leave. 1:i -* Little progress is reported in pushing the Civil Aviation Act through tho Majlis. 12. Roports from Meshed have stated that a new civil landing ground is being constructed immediately South of the existing military one^ Tho Director-General of Civil Aviation states that a now landing ground is not being constructed, but that a terminal building for the use of civil aircraft is being built on tho South side of tho existing landing ground. This is no doubt responsible for the rumour of a new landing ground. 13. Work continues on the now terminal buildings at tho North Last comer of the MEHRABAD (Tohoran) Civil Airport. I*!• O* 1 bho 26th Mxrch a French Air Force Dakota arrived in Tehero.n with two Roche Aviation glidors. At a ceremony at Mohrabad airport these wero handed ovor to tho Teheran Aero Club by tho French Military Attache. The single soater model S.ii.103 is a free gift from the French Government, and tho two seator model C.800 is the first of three to be purchased by the Aoro Club. After the handing over ceremony, a French glider pilot wr.s towed aloft oy a Tiger ^oth. He gave a short and smooth exhibition including loops before landing. EAGLE AIRLINES 13. As forecast in para.7 of tho last Summary, tho difficulties in obtaining the necessary import and exchange licenses which have for so long hold up ohis Company’s negotiations have now to a largo extent been overcome, and the first two Doves are expected to arrive in tho near future. Mr. Mxxwell of B.O.A.C. Head Office visited Basra and Abadan in early April in connection with the B.O.A.C. new service to Abadan, and subsequently visited Teheran between 5th and 8th April. IRANIAN AIRWAYS 16. Tho internal services of this Company continue with fair regularity, although Mr. G.H. Ebtehaj, Managing Director, has stated that tho maintenance ’ situationof all nis aircraft is critical. There can bo little a.rgument on this point, and Mr. Hbtehaj has already approached many repair organisations in the U.K. and on tho Continent in connection with contracting for the major overhauls of his Dakotas. Further to para.9 of tho last Summary, Mr. Nicholl of Scottish Aviation is still in Teheran, but after having boon informed by Mr. Ebtohaj that the demands of his Company vrcud excessive and that the aeal was off, is now on oho point of leaving. A representative of Airwork has also returned to London empty handed. It is believed that two of the Dakotas concerned have been sold and delivered to a Greek airline, and that a third is about to leave for France. IRANIAN STATE AIRLINE !?• This airline recently bought from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company six of their surplus second-hand Gipsy VI engines for approximately £75 each. /FOREIGN *•••••••V ' &gt; - 4 - FOREIGN AIRLffi T ES B # 0 »i- • G « 18.

AIR A TTACHE'S FQRTHIGHILY INTELLIGEi'CE SU, ..ARY FORT NIGHT ENDING 2n d /AY^^lg^B. SECRET PERSIA N AIR FORCE 1 Most of tho machine tools which the Royal Air Force removed durine the mr have now been returned and are being re-installed in the Air Force Factory. It is typical of the lack of drive in the Air Force that two of the orates containing machine tools and weighing aoout four tons each, have boon lying at the Teheran railway station because the Air For'ce cannot find any equipment to lift this weight or vehicles to move it* . 2. Some of the motor transport recently moved by the R.A.F. from Bjlsra to Khorramshahr has now arrived in Teheran and is stated to oe in a satisfactory condition. 3. Further to p-ra.4 of tho last Summary, the effort to move a detachment of six Hurricanes to Ahwaz has proved too much for the Air Force and the project has therefore, not unexpectedly, fallen tnroug 1. 4. Flying and technical training continues at a very slow rate. No bombing or gunnery training has been carried out for the last four months, but the Hurricane Regiment expects to start fairly soon. No night flying training has been carried out for tho last tiro years, and there is not much lik&amp;liehood of any in tho near future. 5. Officer pilots of the Air Force have been threatening to stop flying unless granted flying pay. It is understood t/at officer flying instructors at the F.T.S. are being given a bonus of 20 rials (about 3/-) per flying hour. A similar rate was promised to all other pilots as from the beginning of April. Needless to say the promise has noo been kept. 6. Colonel Adams, the American Air Adviser, recently questioned the pilots of tho Hurricane Regiment on general airmanship and knowledge of their aircraft. While this examination was not exhaustive, the fact that most of the questions were correctly answered reflects well upon the usually unappreciated efforts of tho Hawker Team. 7. Colonel Adams claims that he is not aware of any final arrangements for tho delivery of the . military equipment or when it is likely to begin to arrive. (See para.6 of Summary No.7/48). 8. On I&amp;xy 1st throe Wellingtons of the French Air Force arrived in Teheran on a navigational training flight. It is understood that the aircraft are from a navigational trailing school in Franco, and tho 27 Officers and N.C.Os who arrived with tho aircraft are tho guests of the Persian Army. Tho party is seeing tho sights of Teheran and neighbourhood, and is expected to loavo on tho rotum flight aftor about a -weeks stay. » • • • •£ « * ' ' v t ~ 2 - 9, The gliders referred to in para,14 of the last Smnmry have been in the charge of a Frehoh instructor, who is apparently staying in Teheran for some time. H.I.M, tho Shah inspected the gliders and has flown dual with the French instructor. The gliders will eventually be transferred to tho BA.SH(zA.R airfield, operated by the Teheran Aero Club. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION DEPARTIRNT OF CIVIL AVIATI ON 10. Dakotas of Iranian Airways have recently visited GURGAN, and have used the landing ground previously reported by the Air Attache. Although the area defined by the four briok corner markers is only about 600 x 600 yards, the surrounding area to the Berth East and South West is fit for use, giving a diagonal length of about 1200 yards. Little work has been done on the landing area, and it is now rather soggy after heavy rains and is covered with sparse grass about a foot high. EAGLE AIRLD^ES 11, On the 1st Iny, Doves EP-ACF and EP-ACG arrived in Teheran. The third and last is expected shortly. After the various customs difficulties have been overcome and the necessary survey flights have been carried out, internal services will bo started provided tho necessary spares backing is available. It is understood that the Directors desire to hire one or two Vikings immediately for external services. It is to be hoped th t B.O.A.C. will approve of this display of initiative, which is well founded, as Iranian Airways are incapable of operating regular external services at tho moment, and the Director-General of tho Department of Civil Aviation is most anxious ‘bo have established as soon as possible a well run and regular external service operated by an Iranian Company. IRANIAN AIRWAYS 12. Although serviceability is critical, this line somehow manages to operate internal services intermittently. The most recent bait to the public is the offer of a day excursion to Isfahan for 125© rials, which includes lunoh and a tour of historical monuments. This offer is available four times a week. IRANIAN STATE AIRLINE (AIRMAIL SERVICE) 13, Twice weekly services to RESET, RABULSAR and GURGAN have boon advertised. Passengers can be carried when mail load permits. FOREIGN AIRLINES IwL.M . 14, Further to para. 15 of Summary No.6, this line^ D.C.6 arrived on tho 22nd and loft on the 24th \7ith 15 passengers, but a satisfactory load of freight, which is what they appear to be after. During the aircraft’s stay in Teheran, several demonstration flights were made, including one for H.I.R. the Shah. Passengers were given small presents on leaving tho aircraft and an enormous buffet lunch was available for all Comoro at the Airfield Buffet. /15........f* o *' P.A.A , 15. It Is understood that this lino doos not intend to extend its sorvico now tormina ting at Istanbul, to Teheran until xlehrabad Airport has the necessary facilities to moot international standards. GAIT ERA L 16. The Gemini operated by Alexander Gibb and Partners arrived in Tohoran on the 26th after a major overhaul in the United Kingdom, The aircraft had previously flown about 200 hours throughout tho i3.ddle ilist during the late summon and early winter months. Although this may not be a true test of the aircrafts wooden construction it is never theless noteworthy that only two panols on top of the fuselage had to be changed on the major overhaul, and even this was not absolutely necessary.

The or^oniaation and operation of the first two were comparatively efficient, but at iferaadan the two motoorological assistants wore making no effort to maintain tho equipment or the office. 6* The landing strips at liunadan have been cleaned hp to &amp; ' ‘ certain extent, and the side and corner markers have been renewed. B.O.A.C. Dakotas have used this landing ground in emergency on two occasions in tho last few months and have found it satisfactory, although there arc no services of any description available. 7# At Kormanshah airfield the taxi track branching off about one third of the way up from tho Southern and of tho North/South landing strip and running ibst to tho two airport buildings, has boon repairod and is now the only rooognisod taxi track available for getting off tho runways, i io wind sock is bosido the two small airport buildings mentioned above, which are situated in the South Last oornor of the airfield* 4 * Toheran Flying About' tho 10th of the month a private flyer and passenger in~one of the GluMs Roarwih aircraft struck some trees whilo low flying and wrote-off the aircraft* Tho pilot and passenger regrettably only suffered minor injuries.

Nevertheless this leaves two serviceable aircraft only, and the spares position is by no means satisfactory. I?,OX ./as mado available for spares, but unfortunately tho transaction *as mad to Airwork, and further delay is being caused in having the money transferred to B.O.A.C. before tho spares will be sent. The B.C.A.C* represontativos of Eagle Airlines arc naturally unwilling to undertak scheduled servioos until there is an adequate supply of spares, and tho Persian directors fail to see why they should bo so fussy, eyou liintirp that ”no services, no pay”.

MR GKAFIK, who had previously flown only five times in a sailplane, succeeded on the 28th May in remaining in th^ air for 5 hours 24 minutes and reaching an altitude of 3&gt;300 metres above the airfield. His flight, together with details about gliding certificates, was fully described in the local press on 3'lst May and 1st and 2nd Jume, Unfortunately, on 2nd June, MR AERIAL, the gliding instructor, having demonstrated that the sailplane could be towed off by a jeep, wa s f©ll0we£ by DR FARHAD ARAoTEH (husband of MME ARASTEH, Head of the Mete or •logical Department), who fastened the wrong end of the cable to the release hook; the jeep stopped at the end of its run, and the sailplane, locked tt the cable, hurtled earthwards v/ith fatal results. Though this leaves only o*e dual sailplane, an additional two French single-seaters are being cleared at KHORRAMSHAHR and should be flying in the near future, 10. E agle Ai rline. Considerable dissatisfaction is being caused to the Directors by the failure of the airline to start operations. The aircrew ore also getting restless, and have to find an outlet for their energy in making arrangements to receive the wives and families who have now commenced to arrive. Though various signals were sent to the Foreign Office and B.O.A.C, at the beginning of the period covered by this report, there are still no signs of the essential spores appearing, and until there is notification of +heir despatch it is not possible to plan the commencement of the scheduled services. The last proving flight was made to BAGHDAD on 9th June. 11. I ranian Airv'ays. A contract has been arranged with Field Aircraft Services for the overhaul of aircraft, the first of which is due to arrive at Bovingdon on the 16th June. Mr. EETEHAJ has left for Europe and has stated that after collecting between £30-40,000 worth of spares vhi»h are dotted about in France and the Lav; Countries and talcing them to England, he is going to ascertain if any British company would be prepared to man and taJce over the running of the airline. This is by no means a new development, but whereas before he could afford to run things very much as he wished, and to dictate his terms, he may well tte realising now that Engle Airlines is r . Company v/hich may run him out of business unless he puts his own organ-isation on a much more workmanlike footing. 12. Though this week six aircraft are ostensibly serviceable, and have taken the air, the standard of serviceability does not *improve, and practically no flight takes place without some minor fault coming to light. The effect on the crews is naturally uninspiring, and those who have had experience of efficient servicing are heartily fed up with the whole concern. FOREIGN AIRLINES 13. B.O.A.C. On the 2nd June, Colonel CAMPBEIL, Station Superintendent, received a copy of a letter which had been sent to the Public Prosecutor by a local Barrister at Law, drawing attention to the fact that B.O.A.C. was not registered in accordance with the Companies Registration Law, and asking him to prevent the transe.ctlons of the Company and to prosecute C.#lonel Campbell.

The standard of gunnery vr s oy no L.ocins high, but considering that tije last practices took place about -~cr months ago, it was quite impressive. Two of the aircraft then x'rooeeded ;o drop four practice bcanbs betY^een them, and regain the results oy no means of poor standard; one aircraft got one in the inner circle and one ^uat short of the target, and the other aircraft was aoout 50 yards short with its bombs.

Though no publicity was given to the incident which subsequently occurred, it appears that the Shah used one of the Iranian Air Force Tiger xiaoths based at Isfahan for the return from Kuhrang to Isfahan, and that he experienced engine failure when about 50 kilometres from Isfahan; it was rather unfortunate that after making what is stated to have been a reasonable forced landing the aircraft gently nosed over and ended up on its back. There are varying reports that the Shah wished to continue the flight hij./ in another Tiger Moth which wr.s accompany in g/and which landed nearby, but 'that sundry individuals prostrated themselves in front rf it voicing the Persian equivalent «f ’’ever my dead bcdy'. Whatev^ • t u reaction, the?e is no deubt that many members rf the Court and others wh# hav6 thG interests •f the Shah at heart^are somewhat perturbed that the Shah should have had two accidents in a comparatively short period (see Summary No.14, para.3). 2. 'welcoration a i, O aleh i-icrgheh, 17th Oct»ber . The celebration to commemorate the second year the Shah has been a qualified pilot comnenced at 1600 hours on Sunday, 17th October. It is possible that this date may ultimately bef#me ’'Air rorce Day”, but for this year, as for last year, invitations were n«t extended to foreign officials other than members »f the U.S. Military Mission. The following report has been submitted by an observer. His Imperial Majesty arrived escorted by his brother Prince GHUIAM REZA. In attendance at the aerodrome were the Prime Minister, all the Deputies and members «f the Majlis, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and a very large number of General and ether officers of the Amy and Air Force. On arrival His Majesty inspected the Guard of Honour drawn up on the perimeter track, presented Pilots* Certificates to eight cadets wh» had passed out during the year from the Flying Tmining School and took the salute at a mnroh past. The march past was heaaed by a military band and consisted of officers and men of the ground staff of the Air Force. After the march past was over a fly past of aircraft the Iranian Air Force took place consisting of 10 Ans*ns in vies tf five, 28 Hart Variants and 15 Hurricanes. After the fly past two pilots from the Hurricane Regimeuc gave an exhibition of individual aerobatics and approximately 18 Tiger Moths from the Flying Training School at Doshen Thppeh flew over in such a formation as to represent the word *Shah» in Persian. Light refreshment'! wore then served in two «f the hangars and His Jfaiestv left at about 1730 hours, lJ ^ The turn out (for the Persian Air Force) was exceptionally good; the mar«h past wa« go^djthe formation flying so far as the Ansons were concerned was good ; the Hart Variants were good in some cases, in others a little ragged- and the Hurricane Regiment formation flying was extremely good. The aerobatics were skilfully and smoothly executed by Mth pilots, and the whole display was very much appreciated by everyone. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Razmara, was completely satisfied with the whole thing and stated tint it was a vast improvement on last year's show. S» far as I blow there w»ro no accidents of.any sort and a three days holiday was given to the Air F«r*e Tiy the C.G.S. in recognition cf the good show they put up.. . . . • #•••• - 2 - Tha only advorse oriticism of tho whole show was that the timing in some oases was slightly inaccurate. The Anaons and the Hart Variants wore a few minutes early for the fly past and the arrival of the Tiger Moths writing the work tStah 1 was also a little early and conflicted with the aerobatics', ^5. At the termination of the proceedings the C.G.S, congratulated ;/ing Commander Gibbs of the Hawker Team on the efforts which he had put into the pilot training to produce such a satisfactfry display, and General Kvans and other officers of tho U.S. Military Mission also expressed appreciation of tha high standard of flying# 4General5ho activities of the Hurricane Regiment are still being restricted owing to the shortage of glycol, and little has been done during the month except to prepare for and take part in tho display referred to above. The detachment at Zahidan has correspondingly suffered and has done little flying# / ’ 5. It is rather interesting to observe that in the Summary of the Military Attache, Kabul, for the period ending 21st Septembor # it is stated that rumours are current of increased Iranian activity and troop movements on the Helmand border, but that little credence is placed on these rumours# 6. U.S. Military dssion. Colonel Adams* staff has now been increased by three additional officers and by new U.G.Os who appear to arrive almost' weeklyj one more officer is due to arrive in the near future 'and additional N.C.Os to bring the staff up to four officers and eleven N.C.Os. There is still a hold-up in tho signing of the Agreement for the supply of material beaause of the inability of the U.S. authorities to guarantee the supply of tank ammunition,and correspondingly no sign *f the U.S. aircraft arriving. Colonel Adams’ staff is therefore almost' entirely inactive and tho personnel are filling in time learning Persian# 7. Discussions concerning the renewal of the U.S. ilitary Mission contract are in progressj renewal is almost certain. 8. U.S. Equipment. It is reliably reported that since his return from Germany CoTonei~~GU IIAH S UAK, Deputy-Head of the Air Force, has submitted a report to the Shah in which he strongly recommends that all Iranian Air Force aircraft and ancilliary equipment should be •btainod in future from the United States; a tail-piece is added suggesting that Colenel Guilanshah himself would bo a suitable aspirant for tho post of Air Attache in Washington# The Shah’s reaction is not knowh, but it is unlikely that he is sympathetic towards this recommendation. Tho appointment of an Air Attache in Wishington has been mooted before and the suggestion may well offer a means of putting Colonel Guilanshah in tho background for a time. 9. Training of Persian Pilots. The training of Persian pilots by the Royal Air Force, which bns not boon - mentioned in this Summary for some time past, is still under active discussion. Though certain of the Shah’s ideas were previously known only to himself, the Iranian CG.S. and official British and American authorities, he recently instructed the C.G.S. to tell ling Commander Gibbs of the Hawker Team that there was a probable requirement for training on jet fighters in the near future and that Tfing Commander Gibbs, whose contract expires in February, 1949, might well be able to continue instructing activities after that date. Though such information as Wing Commander Gibbs obtained was only given on the grounds that he is 'an Englishman, an ex-officer and a gentleman' and therefore would not betray the Shah’s confidence, this case typifies tho lack of appreciation of security measures even amongst those in high places.-3~ PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION oro:io g^ Qr - 1 * * * * * * * i^’^par-fa'.idnt, a statement of the present meteorological “ nd ^ ad i° ^ 01 ^tiss at vc.rious stations in Iran is attached as Appendices A C of this Summary.

KAZVBI, No additional details to those contained in J.I # B # 5/l2. QUM. The strips are visible but the general area is not apparent from the air. A nullah crosses the NN'/V/SSE strip south of the intersection of the stips, making it unsorviccable; it is beginning to be grown *ver with scrub. One or two aircraft hive landed on the WVf /ESE strip during the summer. The radial beacon at QUM is still used (See Appendix ’A*)* BABUL SAR. Ho additional details to those contained in J.I.B.5/12# The landing ground has been extensively used by Dakotas and Doves during the summer and facilities may be improved next year. TABRIZ. There is no longer' evidence of the two prepared strips mentioned in J.I.B.5/12. The general area is badly defined, and is not easy to distinguish because of the innumerable lines of shallow dopressions left by the many small rivulets which flow in a southerly direction after heavy rain and snow. The landing ground is used both by the Persian Air Force and internal airlines. An airport building is being built on the southern edge; when it is completed the two runways running E/W and N/S respectively are to be laid. MIYANDUAB. (36°58’ N. 46° 06* jc.) • A landing ground which appeared to be in a good state of preservation with two strips, was seen 3 miles West of Miyanduab positioned in the apex formed by the intersection of the Miyanduab/Mehaba'd road and the Tatao Cham. There is no reference to it in J.I.B.5/12. i REZAIYEH (Civil). The position of the landing ground was eventually pinpointed but the area, seen looked no more like a landing ground than any of the other open areas around about. REZAIYEH (Military). The markings of the name of the airfield (in Persian) and the strips are only just discernable and as far as is known the landing ground has not been used for a considerable period. PAHLEVI. No additional details to those contained in J.I.B.5/12. KERMAN SHAH. Only the general area, the E/jfand N/S runways, and-the circle ' at the intersection of the runways (and not the name of the town in Persian characters) are discemable from the air. Taxi tracks and dispersals have disappeared. The surface *f the runways has deteriorated and there are many loose stones (a landing was made). VISITS 24. Civil Air Attache. Mr B.G.BARNARD, Civil Air Attache, arrived from Baghdad on 19th October and departs' on 1stNovuuhor. During the period of his stay he had a number of discussions with i.ir Chafik, with the Managing Director of Eagle Airlintfc^nd sundry other personalities interested and involved in civil aviation in this country.

Frequent criticisn of the lack of publicity #f B.O.A.C’s services has been heard during the month. At all the larger hotels in the capital and in towns in the provinces there is ample material giving details rf K.L.i-i., S.A.S., Air France and other services; also the information given is invariably of faecindting interest. Advertisement and information with the ’Speedbird* badge inscribed is conspicuous Tty its absence, and on the rare occasions it is soon falls lamentably short *f the standard set by many of the non-British Companies. 27. Misr Airlines. Early in the month the commencement of a weekly Misr Airlines service from Cairo to Teheran via Damascus was advertised. The first aircraft, an Expeditor, arrived about noon on 12th October and left shortly afterwards. It is stated that the service will be established with Vikings but no further flights have taken place. FOREIGN BUSINE SSES 28. Hunting Aerosurveys United. Colonol W. HRIGHT, O.B.H., arrived during the middle of 'the month and is still in Iran with the view of obtaining contracts for producing accurate maps of various parts of the country.

PERSIAN AIR FORCE x 2. li-Prganisation . Plans# which will be fully implemented early next month are stated to have been issued for the re-organisation of the Iranian Air Feree; it is hoped that there will be sufficient information available to ‘ produce a comprehensive statement and Battle Order in next months Summary. The new plan is said to be causing much fluttering in the flock of Colonels who number about 40; of those about 75# are to be removed. It is not easy to ascertain how the interchange of officers between the Services and Government Departments works, though family relations and grasping palms appear to oover a number of personnel movements. It is not, therefore, known whether the approximately 30 redundant officers will settle them selves in other comfortable positions or whether they will bo diverted to more ’:onest ways of livelihood. 3. General mOHAb A submitted his resignation early in the month, having reached a state of frustration which he was no longer able to bear. His resignation has not yet been accepted, and if it is, the Iranian Air Force will be the losers. The re-organisation now contemplated may well be the result of the numerous proposals which he has submitted since coming into •ff ice, and may result in his continuing as Hoad of the Air F«r*e. 4• eawk or Team. -Ting Commandjr Gibbs, whose contract expires on 1st February,' 1949, is concentrating on training 14 pilots with the hope that when he departs tlshore will be a reasonable number of competent officers to take-over where he loaves off.

The -^.waft at la hid an are being flown back to Teheian in groups «f twe cr :hro and there are at present «nly five aircraft left there; the return, ^&lt;s icr all Hurricane flying, is being restricted by the lack of glycol. Hurricane Regiment. V Colonol GHARAI,who had been commanding the 6 . Hurricane Regiment with considerable effect,has also succumbed ~to the frustrations of the appointment and has been replaced by Colonel MIRI, who is a muce lesser man; the latter was r&gt;mevod from the Hurricane Regiment some eighteen months ago at t’ e instigation of ding Commander Gdbbs as being unsuitable for the tasks involved. /2'*** — F- - 2 - 7. uarly in the month a pilot who was detailed for a rocket firing exercise was unable to find the range and, after losing himself, force landed at an old emergency landing strip about 50 miles vYost of Teheran aid slightly damaged the aircraft as a result. At an enquiry afterwards the Squadron Coriander, 'a.-jor KTATISII, an efficient young officer who was trained by the Royal Air Force and who also acts as the Shah’s pilot, informed the senior officers on the board that in his view the accident wag primarily caused by inefficient initial training. He was evidently very farceful in h^s views, which are quite sound, and at least made the few senior officers who were present realise that there is more in initial training than merely being taught to take an aircraft off and land it;* The first fatal accident in the Hurricane Regiment occurred on the morning ^f the 27th November and, in the absence of contra-indication*, would appear t© lend further support to Major KHATEAI'S views. The pilot concerned. Lieutenant ALROM, who had already done a little over 100 ’^irs flying in Hurricanes, was carrying out a camera gun exercise against a ground target sit^d at one edge of the aerodrome. He had already completed e^ght or nine dives at the target, and was at the top of a climb away from it, at about 2,000 feet, on the point of making a further dive when the aircraft stalled and spun. It remained in a spinning attitude until it struck the ground without any indication to those whf&gt; were watching, including .ring Commandsr Gibbs, that the pilot had automatically reacted to the emergency. 8. U*S. equipment. It is believed that the agreement for the supply the equipment lias*'now been signed, and the first consignment, whi$h will pro^bly include tanks, is expected in BANDAR SHAHPOUR about the middle of January. The flow of Thunderbolts is also expected to start a]go^t this date* PERSIAN QIVIL AVIATI ON 9 10 9. Asia Regional Meteorologica l Confer e nce .

A further iftality occurred on Ath. Deoe.rber wne n'~Capt a in 'All dul Hassan ADJUDANI, Commanding Officer of No. 2 Squadron flew into the ground at ZAHIDAN whilst shooting up the airfield after air testing an aircraft wnich he was due to fly back to Teheran. Captain Adjudani was trained in the Royal Air Force and was one of the better types of Junior officer. He had, nov^ver, been previously warned by Y/ing Ccianander Gicbs of the Hawker Team about diving too low during air-to-ground camera gun exercises, and regrettably succumbed to this demonstration oi exuberance, Attempts have been made to pin down this accident and tne one wnich occurred on 27th November (Summary No.16, para.7) to mrterial or human scapegoats, notably by Colonel 3IAHP0USH the Persian A*ir Force Chief Technical-Officer. The latter spent a considerable time endeavouring to prove that the accidents were due to structural failure resulting from carrying wing tanks,and hintea thft Wing Commander Gibbs was indirectly responsible. However, little progress was made on either count and the causes remain self-evident. 2. ' Strike' of Junior Officers. Some time ago tne U.3. Advisory mission persuaded the Ministry of ar tna.t in order to give aircrew^ana particularly those who were married,a feeling of security, their next-of-kin should be awarded Rials 100,000 in the event of ar^y of them being Killed. The next- of-kin of Lieutenant ADR0M (Summary No.16, para.7) were offered a pittance of Rials 1,500 or thereabouts. Th iso came to the etars of a number of Junior officers who decided that this was by no means good enough and therefore resolved to cease performing their duties. However, tnis aspect of the case was not disputed for any length of time because Crptein Adjudani wr s of a family of some standing and the promised sum ox Rifls 10C,000 was distributed to the next-of-kin of both decer^sed without question after ho was killed. Nevertireless the sense of grievance that it should require the death of Captain Adjudani to Justify payment of suitable recompense to the next-of-kin of a pilot of comprratively insignificant family still remained, and the recalcitrant Junior officers went further to point out that the risks involved in every day flying were hardly compatible with their peace of mind. In particultr, the fire tender at QALEH ilOhGHEH wf-s perpetually in an unserviceable condition, as also the ambulanae, and no one in the ambulance knew anything about first-aid; nothing was done to the airfield off the runways and perimeter tracks, so thi;t a swing on take-off or landing might result in a fatality or an injury, for the latter of which there was no recompense. General M0HANNA gave a pep talk at Qaleh Morgheh to the officers concerned, but his efforts to arouse patriotic feeling raised little enthusiasm when he was unable to give any example of reciprocal consideration by the Government for the Air Force generally, nor to hold out ary hope that the Government was willing to spend ary money on imj&gt;roving the lot of the Air Force personnel. General Mohanna tnen tooic up the case with General AHOoROVANI, Deupty Chief of General Staff, who reaffirmed that the Ministry of Y/ar was unwilling to spena more money on improving airfield facilities, but that as a compromise he woulu issue a directive stating that fAjrornft of the Hurricane Regiment were not to fly if there was a chance of there being an accident. This is naturally tantamount to grounding the Hurricane Regiment, and little flying has been done uuring tne flionth. • ••»*&gt;• ••6 2 , 3. Milit ejy R eview . A Military reviev/ was hold at the JELLADIEH Stadium in Teheran on 12th December to commemorate the successful conclusion of the Army's operations in AZERBAIJAN two years ago; similar reviews v/ere held most of the garrison towns. The weather mrae it improssible for the Air Force to organise a. fly past though a certain amount of training for it had been done in the previous few weeks. Thus the Air Force was only represented by a grounu party of sane 300 officers and men which was notably the only formation in the parade, which took rJbout two hours to march past H.I.M. the Shah, which did not O oose-step in passing the saluting base. 4. U.S. Equipment . The U.3. Military Mission has been informed that the Thunderbolts which are in Grermary will not be ready for delivery for another three months; tney are therefore unlikely to be in Iran before the raicdle of May 1949. Colonel Adams, Heau of the Air Force Advisory Mission, does not appear unduly perturbed ana is, in fact, somewhat relieved that this gives a breathing space during which he hopes to persuade the Ifersian authorities to do a little pre-planning for tne supply of various expend able items which have not yet been ordered. Colonel Aunms and his staff rre laboriously supervising the trnnslction of U.S. handbooks on the incoming aircraft with few facilities in the way of interpreters end only one typist. 5. Budg et. The U.S. Military Mission has been asked to review a supplementary Budget of Rials 3 billions + expendnble by the Ministry of 7, r ar over the next three years. The detailed items include £5 millions sterling for new aircraft ana radar equipment, and £100,000 sterling for Air Force training. ‘Colonel Adams views the latter as a step in the right direction, but considers the former an unsound commitment unless something is done soon to drastically reorganise the Air Force, particularly at the top. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION Director-General of Civil Aviation . Mr Ahmad CHAFIK witn his wife Princess ASHRAF and Princess FATEMEH arrived back in Teheran from India in an Iranian Airways scheduled service on 18th December. 7. Mr 0ha.fik has at 1; st managed to make some progress witn his idea of a unified air line with part Government participation, ana Mr Abul Hassan EBTEHAJ, Governor of the Bank Melli and brother of Mr Gholam Hossein EBTEHAJ, the Managing Director of Iranian Ain/ays, has been nominated a.s arbitrator; he has in turn appointed two accountants to value the assets of the tnree airlines - Iranian State Airline, Iranian Airways and Eagle Airlines. The first of these airlines is run by a Department of the Ministry of Posts, Telephones and Telegrapns, whicn would probaHLy nave to resume a commercial facade if the proposed merger takes place. Mr Chafik's present intention is tmt the Government snould only hold about one third of the shares and that a foreign undertaking should provide technical aid; he hopes tha.t considerable progress towards a unified organisation will be made in three or four months. 8. Eagle Airlines . Eagle airlines became more and more run down as the menth progressed. It is understood from an extremely reliable informant, though it is disputed by the 3.O.A.C. Station Superintendent, that authority for payment of the ground staff was outstanding during the second weex of the month and that they all 'knocked-off' for a couple of days rnd enjoyed themselves in Teheran on their existing savings or credit. Owing to the failure of the Board to clear de-icing fluid through Customs, services were not continued on days when icing was encountered. Finally the drte fixed in the B.O.A.C. ultimatum was reached and flying ceased with effect from 15th December, Eight of the seconded personnel returned to tue U.K. just before Chirstmas, and the remainder except for the senior ground engineer and one assistant left to-day (3rd January).9.

Discussions betvften Mr BROAD and the Board of Eagle Airlines continued during the first liw days of tne month in an attempt to retch a settlement. Mr CHAPIK attended some of the meetings au also nad a long discussion with Mr Broad, Colonel CAMPBELL (L.O.A.C. Station Superintenoent) ana myself about the impasse, the probability of its circumvention, and the. possibility of furure participation in the resuscitated airline by B.O.A.C. The Board had eventually producea a purely erbitrary figure of £18,500 as the maxim, m amount wnich they coula pay to meet the current account aebt cf £s2,50C, a figure to v/nicii B.O.A.C. had alreaay v/hittled down their initial demand. Mr Chafik hopeq. tnat this v/oula be acceptable, ana- tnough he was told that tnis wes unliKely, made every effort to linx the present negotiations Vid tn discussions on B. O.A.C.’s continued participstion, particularly insofar' as it mighr result in mutual benefit when a merger airline is formed in which the Government will actively participate. He was informed by Mr Broad that the one could not be combined with the other, and that the indebtedness by the Lag. e Board would have to be settled before ftry further idea of continued B.O.A.C. participation could be discussed. 6. After furtner unproductive discussions Mr Broad decreed that the negftiations had reached a stage at which personal representation at his Head Office was necessary. He left on 10th Janua'^ taking with him a confirmatory l/etter from the Board that they would pay £18,500 n final settlement of the current account. However, this confirmation included the remarkable statement that p»ayments would be made over a period of 24 months, without security and without guarantee; non-acceptance by B.O.A.C. was a foregone conclusion.- 2 - Tk» Station Superintendent oelivered d.O.A.C.’S fined, ultimatum, in whieh the Botxd wr® given a further opportunity of raising the money by the 15th February,on the 20th January. There is no indication that the Board 'Jill be any more amenable to a reasonable settlement; on the contrary, it is known that a letter is being sent to 3.0.A.C. in vhich their terms rre stated to be unjust and unreasonable. The sad and unfortunate story of B.0.A*C« participation in an Iranian Company therefore draws to a close. 8* The senior ground engineer and assistant who were remaining behind to make the sir craft serviceable pending a general settlement have novr departed, to-day and last Thursday respectively. Colonel Campbell has also co me need making arrange tuents to transfer a quantity of spares, held in customs at KHORRAMSHAHR, to BAS?AH. 9. It was learned to-day that Eagle Airlines offered one of their Doves to Iranian Airways for £15,000, and that Mr EBTEHAJ had little hesitation in refusing the offer. It is also rumoured that Eagle Airlines are attempting to buy three Dakotas, to be manned with French crews, with which tney will recommence internal services. 10. Irani an Airways. Though the aircraft which caught fire at BIRJAND is insured with an Iranian Company it has been 100/' reinsured with Lloyd’s. Iranian Airv/ays claim that there is about 70^ damage, the local insurance Company soys 65/0, and the locol Lloyd’s agent, after considerable delving, believes the figure to be ab«ut 5^- or less. As the amount involved is £10,000, considerable discussion has resulted. Unfortunately it is difficult to find a disinterested engineer, capable of carrying out a survey, wno can be made available to inspect the aircraft - t^ie journey V road will take about ten days, there and back. 11. M eteor ological Department. The tmrty meteorological assistants who were being trained by Madame ARA3TEH at .-IEMRABAD have now completed their course (Sujnary No. 15/4$, para. 10). Though equipment to open new reporting stations is still not available, it is hoped tnat tney will be able to make use of such elementary apparatus as can be found, and thereby supplement even to a small extent tne relatively meagre cover. 12. Ra dio F acil ities . Point-to-point onannels have recently been opened between Teheran and Cairo, Paris, Karachi and Istanbul. Beacon frequencies have also been altered. Anendments to tne Appendices to Summary No, 15/43 are given in Appendix ’A’, and reflect these cnanges. 13. Pilots* Licence s. Mr Chafik instituted an order, effective from the 1st January, that all ooumerci&amp;l pilots flying on routes •utside Iran v/ere to be in possession of a current ’B 1 Licence and a Second-class Navigator's Licence. This has caused considerable consternation in Iranian Airways where previously pilots have made use of an authorisation certificate signed by Mr Chafik himself. Two pilots of French nationality have obtained equivalent licences from the authorities in Paris without much difficulty, but the rest are placed in a somewhat embarassing position, particularly as Iranian Airv/ays . as yet show, no willingness to spend tne money -or to allow the time off wuich the securing of the licences entails. 14» Finance. A Council of Ministers' decree of 10th January governing the availability of foreign exchange for imports, which was subsequently modified, allows certain articles to be imported by payment of 55 /j of the amount due at the official rate of exchange and 45/5 at the free market rate. Aircraft and their spares are included, which gives a material benefit compared with the previous arrangement in v/nich only of the amount was made available at the official rate of exchange* /jo0O' -3- Teheran prying Club. The aircraft vmich was missing on 26th December (bunvnary No. 17, para. 14) has net yet been discovered. The pilot was, ftjwever, found on 12th January frozen to death in the vicinity of GAIMSAR (atout 3^ miles S.E. of Teheran) and iiis passenger was also found deed in the same area on the 28th January. bKATHER 16. There have been occasional snowfalls in the mountains but on the plateau temperatures have risen end precipitation has been in the form of rain or very wet snow. Many roads still remain blocked to private cars. In Teheran itself the thaw nas caused much of the bsdly-laid tar-macadam to crack and disintegrate, and in many of the streets there are large pot holes 6' or more deep. It is understood tnat the Government has ideas on re-laying the roads in Teheran, at an estimated cost of about £2,000,000. FOREIGN AI RLINES 17. Indi an O verse a s Air lines. Indian Overseas Airlines is commencing a reciprocal service to that of Iranian Airways next month. It is stated tnat the first aircraft will leave DELHI on the 10th February and arrive in Teheran on the 12th February vi.a KARACHI and ZAHIDAM. 18. B.0 .A.C. The Station Superintendent states tnat the service from the United Kingdom will be flown by Canadairs from 1st September next and that tne service 'will be extended to Karachi and Delhi concurrently. PRESS AN D RADIO COMMENT 19. A statement appeared in the local press on 12th January giving the General Staff's categorical denial of a report transmitted by Radio New York on 10th January that the Turkish and Persian General Staffs had had conversations to discuss the provision of airfields in Iran for use by the Turkish Air Force. It was stated by Radio New York that the airfields would be constructed when U.S. aircraft were supplied to Turkey, thereby permitting the Turkish Air Force to increase its radius of action. On 14th January ilARDOM, the Tudeh paper, contained a discussion of the radio v roadcast and stated that it followed the Chief of General Staff’s authorisation to permit U.S. aircraft to land at Iranian airports;, the article continued the familiar argument that Iran would eventually become a strategic base for Anglo-Saxon warmongers. 20. On tne 5th January Moscow Radio again repeated the allegations that new \ aerodromes were being built in Iran (Summary No. 17/48, para, 26) which l resulted in a further denial from Radio Teheran. 1 , 21. A local paper featured an unusually long aviation article on 26tn January - the story of Air Service Training Limited by PERCY NE3STLR. 22. The recent discussion in the House of Commons about tne supply of aircraft ana equipment to the U.S.3.R. and satellite countries was mentioned on the 27th January. DISTR IBUTION As per attached list./3»••* 7. A slight re-organisation in the staff of the Air F'erce Head- quiirters has tai&lt;en place with the advent of Colonel 3epahpour, The appointment of Chief of Staff has been dis-established and Colonel BAYANDOR, who was filling this appointment, has become Chief Technical Officer which, it^s understood, will be upgraded to a Brigadier’s appointment. Matters previously dealt with by the Chief of Staff will now be snared between Colonel K. GUILA^IiAH, Deputy Head of the Air Force anu Colonel Bayanaor. A matter of greater importance is the decision that all detachments of the Persian Air Force, which at .present are stationed at Tabriz, Isfahan, Shiraz; and Ahwaz, are to be uno.er tne direct control of Air Force Headquarters at uoshen T&amp;ppeh and not under tne local Divisional Commander as hitherto. No doubt tnis will initially cause a number of difficulties, but it is to the credit of General Mohanna thft he has been able to persuade the General Staff to allow the Air Force to gain this increased independence. 9. Finance. The Head of the Air Force hopes to get an appropriation of Tomans 5 millions (about DA-00,00C) in next year’s Budget. 13. Pay and Alla ance_s. It has been agreed there snould be a pay increase of Rials 1 ,500 per month for aircrew and Rials 90 / '' fer ground crew working on aircraft, and also that meals should be provided for these personnel; it is believed that H.I.M. the Shah was instrumental in obtaining these increases. Ho\rever, the specified amount of money wnich has oeen set aside for tne purpose is insufficient to permit the payment nf all quaJLified personnel at the rates stated, and discussion a^bout a suitable pro—rata scale is therefore in progress. 11.

The Shan gave his vie. 4 ' c 'o , ic importance of Iran, his oomaents in man^v instances oeing extremely detailed, and expressed disappointment tnat after making similar statements to high-ranking Service liiicers in the United Kingdom, r/nicn they appeared to appreciate and agree, he had not yet received any information abouy^he seneme for training a fighter defence force which was to be a most important and integral pjart of the defence of the oil-fielas area. The interview ended on a happy note when Y/ing Commander Gibbs was presented with a fine Isfahan carpet. 12. Owing to a recent order preventing the sale of sterling on the free market and tne rising cost of living, members of the Hawker Team have had the value of their allowances reduced to an extent which has necessitated immediate reference to the parent Compary. Mr 'Bill” Humble, the Sales Manager, who was visiting India and Pakistan, came to Teheran on 21st February to ascertain tire facts on the spot. Before departing on 24th February he expressed tte view that if there was to be an increase in expenditure it should either be met by the Persian Government or balanced by a reduction in the staff, and that his Company were unlikely to accept any further outlay when they were already losing £6,000 per annum on the Hurricane contract.

OB ITUARY 2 9. It is with the utmost regret that I report the death of Lieutenant~Colone 1 C.M.

Greer, Stewart and Luke. 3 C* , Colonel Christ was flying to DAHRAN. The last W/T message, which gaive no indication of any difficulty, -'.vts received 2 hours 10 minutes after leaving Me hr ab ad when the aircraft was flying above cloud at 17,000 e&lt;^ ; Dahran called 20 minutes later but there was no response. The search commenced the following^ day with a Skymaster and two Fortresses from Dahran, ne Military Mission Dakota and the Shah's Fortress piloted by Mr Chafik ana was continued daily, with the addition on the 8th of the Daicota of Colonel COWARD, U.S. Air Attache in Baghdad, until the 10th February when he aircraft was discovered crashed on a hillside in the BAKHTIARI mountains at an altitude of about 9,0*0 feet,on a direct line from Mehrabad to Abadan and about 199 miles short of Abadan; the first aircraft to sight the crash was the air-sea rescue Fortress from Dahran. Though the main structure of the aircraft was not disintegrated, hope of any survivors was soon dispelled sign t f ^?^ tinued P-sence of the search aircraft failed to bring forth RaZmMRA, the Chief of General Staff, co-operated by sending two small ski parties with mules to the scene of the crash; a U.S. Officer from the Gendarmerie Mission was sent from Teheran with signals equipmentto link up witn one of tne perties. The ski parties started’from tw® s . i rbout 30 miles apart, each about 50 miles from the crash - the'^iana^^^ February and the other on 14th February, The going was extremely difficult and jhe mules soon proved to be a hindrance rather tnan a help. Two Ansons fror .he Persian Air Force were also sent to SULTANABAD and kept in touch witii the ski parties, dropping supplies as and when necessary. The crash was eventually reached in the late afternoon of 21st February, but by this time much snow had fallen and great difficulty was found in entering the wreckage. On this day only two bodies, those of Colonel Christ and Captain Sanders, were found, picks end shovels were dropped to the party the following day to enable the snow and ice to be removed and an entry to be made into the fuselage where the remainder of the crew were discovered. 32. The aircraft search arrangements were co-ordinated by Colonel M.B. ADAkIS , Head of tne Air Force contingent in the^ Military Mission. It is his view that Colonel Christ let-down through cloudyhinking he was near Abadan and therefore flying over low lying ground, wher^is in fact he was flying over one of the most hazardous areas in Iran. This supposition may well be correct as a Skymaster which flew up from Dahran on the 6th February calculated that the component of the wind along the track from Teheran to Abadan was about 55 knots and twice thLt forecast, which would position Colonel Christ's Dakota in the area in v/hich it crashed. 33 . a Memorial Service for Colonel Christ and his crew was held in the afternoon of 24th February at the American Mission Churchy and was attended by a large gathering which inducted members of the Diplomatic Corps, representatives of the Royal Family, and members of the General Staff (General Ramara himself was present^ and of the Persian Air Force, DISTRIBUTION As per list published with Summary No.1/49* oOo——Refers nee ; - wy'W:d-i EXT D§l ; f TRHHiAN 31st March, 19 AIR Al f i'ACHE ' b i-IQrJTHLY INfLLLI GRNGR SU^iidA I^Y No.3 MAR CH &gt; 194 9 SECRET, PREAMBLE 1 The celebration of the Persian New Year 1328 on 21st March with its attendant official five days' holiday conveniently extended in many cases to 13 days, resulted in little activity during the latter part of the month, PE’ QfflQt ions, Colonel M # SE1AHP0UR., Head of the Air Force, v/as promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in the Persian New Year's Honours List.

Training Saheme. a Working Party, consisting of Brigadier General Sepahpour and Colonels BAYANDOR and ALA'I, has been formed to review and make recoinaendations on the two training scheuies prepared by Air Ministry. The first meeting was held on 14th March and a furtner meeting on 29th March. Following the first meeting a submission was made to H.I.M. the Shah suggesting that the smaller of the tv/o Schemes would be most suitable, increased, if he consiaerea such an increase desirable, in proportion to the personnel wno could be provided for training. However, on this first approach, the Shah adhered to his original preference for the larger Scheme which necessitates the provision of a little more tnan 1,500 Persians of suitable educational standard who can speak and understand English. This seems to be quite beyond the Persians' present capacity, and, of the officers on the Working Party, Colonel Bayandor appears to be the only one wno fully appreciates the standards required and tne difficulty, if not the imposs ibility, of providing thainees who will fulfil requirements. It is somewhat surprising to observe in the other officers concerned, ana. even in the 3hah himself, a naive belief that a scheme on paper will sprout into an efficient Fighter Defence Force with absolute ease and v/ith little effort on the part of the promoters. 4. Hawker Te am . Ping Commander E.P.P. GIBBS, D.F.C., left Iran early in the month. Mr F. HOLMAN, ex-Squa.dron Leader in the Royal Air Force, also left; as an armament specialist he had little to do, and it was considered that he could well be withdrawn and thereby reduce the Compary's financial burden to some degree. Squadron Leader Holman hopes to be able to return to the Royal Air Force, D EPARTMEN T OF CI VIL AVIATION 5. Director-General of Civil Avia- tion. Mr A.

The break with B.0.A*C. is by no means complete, and during the month one of the directors paid a call at the Head Office of the Corporatioi Enquiries have been made by B.O.A.C. as to the probability of getting their debt paid by litigation, but there would seem little hope of achieving anything in this direction at present. At Mehrabad there is no activity whatsoever, and the two aircraft which are there remain locked in their hangar; all the locally employed staff have been dismissed except for one engineer and a storeman.- 2 - 7. Iranian Airways. On the evening of 29th March a small but distinguished party ^attends d'the inauguration of a common agency for Iranian Airways and Air France. The return of the scheduled Air rrance service was delayed one day in order to take back to Paris the representatives from Head Office. The ceremony was held iYi the new joint office, vdiich has been quite tastefully constructed and decorated. As far as is knov/n there is no further link-up between the twu Companies than this co^on office and the sale of the other Company's tickets by either organisation. It msy well be, however, a step in a further co-uperative direction, particularly as Iranian Airways aircraft now depend on Air France to a substantial extent for their overhauls (ounxnary Ku. 16/2+3, para.15)» There would seem little doubt also that, when the unified Iranian airline comes into being, Mr EBTEHAJ will be a controlling influence and will bring with him the interest of Air France. Nevertheless Mr Ebtehaj shows an interest in British aircraft, and during his recent visit to Cairo spent a considerable time investigating t.he practicability of making use of the repair ana maintenance organisation which has recently been set up in the Middle East in association with Misr Airlines. 8. Iranian State Airline. The statement under this heading in Suranary No.2/49 (paraTfaTTs nut ‘'altogether correct; no postal services are being run to small locations c y;m the Persirn Gulf by i.his airline. Three airerdt of the Teteran Aero Club are at present at Abadan, and it is intended that they should carry mail between Abadan, Bushire, Lingeh, Bandar Abbas, Jask and Chahbahr. The aircraft are manned by three pilots vho are ex-Ar^iy officers and who were trained by the Club; a pilot has been aetached from Iranian Airways to supervise the organisation and to assist these inexperienced pilots. The Ministry of Posts, Telephones and Telegraphs is subsidising the venture very liberally, not only to provide air mail services in the Gulf, but also to give an indirect subsidy to help the Aero Club. If tne venture is successful it is probable that a similar arrangement will be made for carrying mail between Ham.-tlr n - T ' v, “’ lanshah, Banandaj, Rezaieh, Tabriz, Zenjan and Kazvin. 9 Proposed Unified AirUrije. Mr Chafik hopes to obtain an appropriation of Tomans ij rnildions '’/about B100, COO ) as the Government's contribution towards the unified airline. He is not eager that the Government should absorb more than 41 / of the capital, so that if in fact he manages to obtain this sum it is probable that .part of it will be used for other purposes. It is believed that Mir Ebtehaj of Iranian Airways is very luke-warm about bringing Eagle Airlines into the merger until they .can liquidate tneir mary outstanding financial obligations. 10. pilots' Licenses. During his visit to Egypt Mr Chafik hopes to SOIne arr angemenT with The I.C.A.C- representative in Cairo by which he will be able to award licenses which will receive international recognition He has expressed his firm intention of adhering to 'B' License, and ultimately I.C.A.C. standards, except for instrument rating categories. 11 12 11. General. Major MOHAMMED ALI KHADSMI, the Iranian Airways jpilot mentioned in parapHTof Sunmory No. 12/48, has now returned to Teheran after qualifying for his 'B' License and Second Class Navigation License in the United Kingdom. He has returned with a number of ideas for improving civil aviation facilities and standards ^ the Pountry, but what exactly he will be able to do, or to what extent he may be able to in. 1 'nee the right people, it is too early to decide. Yath the merged airline in -u^ offing it would seem probable that he would only be permitted to branch out on his own in a charter, maintenance or freight organisation on a restricted sca^e. AIRFIELDS 12. Rezaieh. Mr Chafik is eager to open an airfield at Rezaieh for commercial use. The military airfield is not only too small but is also too far from the town to be attractive, and the so-called civil airfield has fallen co much into disuse that it is almost indiscernible from the air. Mr Chafik has persuaded the military authorities to look for and survey a suitable site near the town.13. Abadan. I4r Chafik’s ddeas on the improvement of Abadan have gone a further stage forward with the onlling by theMinistry of Roads for tenders to improve one runrr-y to enable the operation of aircraft weighing up to 100 tons. It is hoped that Fimpeys may show some interest. WEATHER 14. The crisp winter weather has given place to a transitional unsettled type whicn has br ug onusually large a.nount of rain to the Teheran area; most of the snov/has now disappeared -^rom the foothills, mar^y of the r&gt;ads previously closed by snow are now closed by inundations, and internal air commurications have also been considerably interrupted. 15. A complication was caused tov/ards the end of the month by the failure of Mehrabad power-supply, which resulted in no meteorological information being received for almost one complete asy 0 The failure occurred at a time when an Iranian Airways aircraft was flying from Shiraz in extremely dirty weather, T-ie pilot, who was flying blind on tne radio cgmpa§&amp;, eventually made his way to Teheran through pouring rain after descending and identifying 'a small black mountain' about 75 miles away. FOR EIGN AIRLINES 16. K.L.M . K.L.M. is giving publicity to the Summer service whieh CQamences early next month. The aircraft will leave Teheran at 0730 hours on Saturdays and arrive ih Amsterdam via Istanbul and Rome at 2030 hours the same day. Passengers wishing to fly to Nu York- can re-em.bcrk on the trans-Atlantic service that same evening rnd oe there the following morning, 17* A model of a Constellation was presented by the airline to H.I.M* the Shah at the Persian New Year an an expression of the Compary's gratitude that His Majesty had bet - r d from the attempted assassination. 18. Indian Oversean Airl ines, inis airline has lost interest for the time being in running a reciprocal service to that of Iranian Airways. (See para. 23, Sumaary No.2/49). 19. South American Airlines. The Argentine Minister recently made enquiries about the possibility of the F.A.k.A, airline being permitted to fly tp Teheran. This follows a somewhat similar investigation last Autumn by th© Brazilian Ambassador who decided that there was insufficient inducement tp bring in Panair do Brazil, ar who did not therefore pursus the matter. TTh&amp;tever foreign operators m y have in mind, Mr Chafik is not eager to introduce other services, except perhaps one by Alitalia on a reciprocal basis as any Iranian aircraft flyirg to Bur-ope .invariable land in Italy# PKS SS AM) RADIO CO MMENT 20.

Of the ai\ny officers concerned Generals A.H. HADJAZI and A.K.AY/DI were presented with the former decoration, and Colonel V. ANSARI and Major H. FARDOUST with the latter.

Mahmud Ghezel Ayagh, Equipment section at Doshen Tappeh. Hosseingholi Shaghaghi, Hind Squadron. Abbas Tavangar. Mohammad Taghi Vafegh, Technical section at Doshen Tappeh. 3* Per sonnel and Aircraft Strength . Verbal information on ideas of reorganisation was recently received. Though, sundry of these ideas were committed to paper with the assistance of the U.S. Mission, they are at present too impra.ctical to merit attention, and are recognised to be so by their originators. Fundamentally the Persian Air Force is unbalanced, both in personnel and aircraft, and until this is rectified little headway can be made in producing a really efficient service. Existing strengths of personnel and aircraft in units mean little, because with the advent of Dakotas (referred to below) and the impending arrival of the other U.S. aircraft, personnel are being arbitrarily moved from unit to unit, and the number of aircraft operationally useable varies corres pondingly. Details of total personnel and aircraft are given in Appendices 'A' and 'B* respectively, and indicate clearly the lack of balance referred to above, P n addition to the personnel detailed in Appendix 'A' there are some 800 privates who are conscripted for two years' service; they do not appear in the official list of Iranian Air Force personnel n.nd are used for general duties such as orderly, messenger, cleaner, guard, etc. The Air Force therefore is virtually run by some 300 officers and 500 tradesmen, the latter being supple mented by about 100 civilians who work in the factory at Doshen Tappeh doing engine overhauls and major repairs. 3* In connection with the aircraft strengths it should not be forgotten that the figures v/ill be increased, possibly in the next month or so, by the 60 Thunderbolts a-nd by the Ha.rvards and light communication aircraft which the U.S. authorities have undertaken to supply. • ••••••* - 2 - 6. It is clear therefore that with the present set-up, which, without being impolite, is a hotch-potch, rigorous rearrangement and possibly scrapping of the obsolete biplanes will be essential if only to allow the new American equipment to be used with a reasonable degree of efficiency; should some training agreement be reached with the Royal Air Force complete reformation will be necessary. Whether the Persian authorities -will take the drastic action which is required or will prefer to be in possession of a motley array of aircraft, of necessity ill-maintained and little used, remains to be seen* 7. U*S. Military M i ssion * All who knew Colonel MILTON B. ADAMS, Head of the A. ir Force component of the Military Mission, were sorry to see him depart on the 4th, He left in the S.A*S* scheduled service with wife (waving baby's bottle) and children, for a short and well-earned'break viewing a few of Europe's capitals before flying on to the States, 8. . Until a relief arrives, Lieutenant Colonel H.E. DES GEORGES, an administrative officer, is in charge of the Air Force side of the Mission, and will be advised on technical flying matters by Lieutenant Colonel Y/.R. DUNN, a comparatively recent arrival and an ex-member of one of the Eagle Squadrons. 9 # U.S. Equipment * The seven Dakotas, due to arrive from Germany on the 6th eventually appeared on the 24th, together with two extra Dakotas to return the ferrying crews; a further Dakota remained at Athens with engine trouble. Though the aircraft were originally flown in to Qaleh Morgheh, the home of the Hurricanes and Ansons, at least two are being moved to Mehrabad, the civil airport,to leave more room for the Thunderbolts when they arrive, and to permit easier useage ot tiie civil facilities; to this end a portion of the aerodrome is being gra.ded and rolled. 10. Detachments . In order to ease the congestion which will follow the arrival of Harvards at Doshon Tappch, it is intended that five Hinds and five Harts will be detached to Meshed. 11. Training Ab road , Approximately 25 officers ajre being sent from the Services to France for various types of training and instruction; of these 12 are from the Air Force, 2 of whom are being sent to the Staff College, 2 for paratroop training, 4 for navigation training, 2 for meteorological training and 2 for signals training. It is also rumoured that two Air Force officers are being sent for some sort of training to the United States, but details are not known. FOREIGN AIR FORCES 12. fl ight of Unide nti f ied Airc raft . It was reported in the local press that an unidentified aircraft, flying over B^YNUH at about 1300 hours (L.T») on the 11th, was fired at by the local garrison, this report subsequently led to assertions that the aircraft was of Russian origin. The Chief of Imperial General Staff stated, however, that it was a K,L,M. aircraft, and independent enquiries made to the K.L.Mo manager support this view-, DEPAR TMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION 1.3» Directur-Gener al of Civil Avia/ 1ion , Mr A. Chnfik returned from Egypt on the 7th. He had been unable to see the I.C.A.O. representative about pilots' licences so his idea of obtaining international approval for the licences which he might issue has not progressed much further. 14 14. E agle.Ai rlines, On tne Persian side there are still attempts to re-interest B, 0.ii.oC. in its resuscitation, or to persuade De Havillands or Airwork to restore their fallen fortunes; nowevor, the firms are not sufficiently purblind to follow B.O.A.C's unfortunate ana expo nsive experience. For their part B.O.A.C. feel that the stage has now been reached th;.t something drastic must be done to settle their outstanding claims, ant. it seems likely that unless the D.G.C.A. can hold out some hope of settlement at the time the air lines are merged, the affair will end up in the Persian Courts,N A 1 5.

Certainly the change has caused much ili-fecling and will be of little bo nel it to the airline which will lose Tissandierj a pilot of considerable experience, and p- ssibly also Mr ]?„ PAIM (a South African and also an ex-Royal Air Force Officer of considerable experience) who will probably return with him to the United Kingdom, 16 * Ir anian State A irline, The activities of this'airline have gradually been running down during the winter and it now reclines in that peculiar state aptly referred to as suspended animation.

Major KHADEMI (Su.xmry No.3/49, para. 11) had his eyes on the aircraft to enable him to strrt a charter service; he also had ideas of utilising the Doves of Eagle Airlines, in c, njunction with the Ministry of agriculture, f r anti-1 and crop dusting c These suggestions have now gone by che board as he is unce^ .;*iive recalled to tlie Air Force to assist with the Dakotas, ^7* girlie Id Equipment.

Visits were made to the Iranian Air Force detachments at Isfahan and Shiraz during the month; they are commanded by Majors MOUSAVI and KHOSRAVI respectively. Both units had the same aircraft strength of three Hinds and two Tiger Moths; in the case of Shiraz it was stated that two Hinds were at Doshen Tappoh under repair. It was said, in particular at Shiraz, that a fair amount of flying was done, averaging 2 hours flying per aircraft per day, but in fact there wad no activity during the days of the visits at either place. Externally the aircraft were in reasonable trim, but as to all intents and purposes they were wheeled out of the hahgars in the morning and back again at lunch time there was little reason for thsm to be otherwise. The Detachment Commanders’ offices, the only rooms of consequence, were surprisingly like; they were the meeting places for all the Detachment’s officers, had a table and a few chairs, nothing on the walls except a photograph of the Shah, and were not disgraced by the presence of filing cabinets, papers or any other apparatus indicative of mental or physical activity*, 2.

A paper was recently seen, sn.id to have been produced by Mr Chafik, detailing improvements in civil aviation facilities which should be incorporated in the Seven Years Plan.

Eagle Airlines. Discussion between the B.O.A.C. Station Superintendent and the Persian Directors about outstanding claims continues. The Chairman of the Company, Mr YGANEGI, has admitted that they have no resources_ whatsoever other than the three Doves.

This situation is not likely to continue as other pilots have been enlisted, amongst whom there are two Englishmen who have been flying with Pak Air, The contract for carrying internal mail has been lost because, it is alleged, of the high charges, Mr Ebtehaj does not seem to be unduly worried and states that in any ca.se it was not a very lucr&lt;ative undertaking. There han been no extension to the airmail service run by the Aero Club down the Persian Gulf, so at present there is no airmail connection betroen Teheran and the provinces* 15. Mr Ebtehaj’s idea of operating the merged airline, in which he undoubtedly will take a leading part, is to obtain more Dakotas to use for external services and for long range internal services, and to man then with foreign crews and have them maintained by foreign engineers, possibly having major overhauls carried out in Cairo® For short distance internal services he contemplates using Rapides, a number of which he can undoubtedly purchase at a low figure 0 He does not think that the Doves of Eagle Airlines are of any use whatsoev' • ... 1-1 to see them come into the merger unless the assessment of their vaiue is riu- AIRFIELDS 16* A blue print was recently obtained frm v. i^marr-Air-~lk)J?ce authorities giving an outline of the country and the position of landing grounds, together with a key showing types of surfaces and dimensions.

No additional details to those contained in Summary No.4/49* para. 19 . The radio beacon in the town (Callsign TTTT, Frequency 246 K/cs, Power ,15 Kw) which has never been very satisfactory, is stated to be now utterly unserviceable, and is expected to be replaced by a new beacon in the near future. SULTANABAD, The windsock and most- of the markings have nor/ disappeared but the landing ground is still fairly easily discernible from the air. It is still occasionally used by the Persian Air Force. (Summary No.2/49, para.31), HAMAD AN . The windsock has disappeared. No civil aircraft use the airfield regularly, and, as far as is known, no aircraft has landed there for at least a year. IffiZD. There is one strip of graded and rolled gravel, part of which is either oiled or tarmacaded, WN7//ESE, and another at right angles in the process of completion. There is a nine foot garden wall at the Eastern end of the completed strip (which is about 900 yards in length) which does not amuse the pilots of Iranian Airways who nowISFAHAN* SHIRAZ. • BUS HE RE, GACH SARAN. sh/ais&gt;i«ar;j3.

There is no wind indicator or markings* P.O*L# is available from the A.I.O.C. in Yezd., where there is also telephone and telegraph. The area is susceptible to dust haze (Summary No.2/49&gt; para. 16) which was prevalent at the time of the visit. The tower 500 feet high 500 yards distance, is in fact a silo of considerable dimensions. The mosque on the boundary is very small and not more than 25 feet high. The NNE/SST7 strip is the one generally used. A landing was made and the surface was found to be rough with quantities of losse stones. There is no E/W strip. Like every other landing ground which has no strip of tarmacadam or concrete, the surface is rough, and there are numbers of loose stones. A landing was made. The airfield is used regularly by Iranian Airways and has been used often by a Bristol Freighter of Hunting Aerosurveys Limited. Though visibility was not good at the time of the visit, the wind indicator and most of the markings seem to have disappeared. There are no radio aids. The NI7/SE and ENE/WSY/ strips appear to have been extended. The letters ,, GSN , ‘ are inscribed in the triangle enclosed by the three strips. The strips are still discernible from the air but appear disused. As for SHAMS-I-ARAB. No additional comments to those in JIB5/12. The snail landing ground referred to in Appendix ’A* to JIB5/12 has again been brought into use for the Club aircraft!which are flying mail down the Persian Gulf. A landing,was made. The surface was found to be apalling, with irrdgulah and widely spaced undulations of hard sand and areas of‘soft sand. The landing area is marked with badly white-washed stones, difficult to see, with a circle in the oentr^ enclosing the letters , BA' and is no more than 650 yards’’ in any direction; there is no wind sock. Approaches are clear except for the low houses and buildings around the airfield, none of which are nearer than 500 yards. There is a perceptible slope uqwards towards the North where there are sahd-dunes and hillocks. P.O.L. can be obtained from the A.I.0JCf» in the town. A more suitable area for a landing ground lies to the West of the town. &gt;The landing ground used by Iranian Airways (27°20‘ , N 56?P1”E), at which a landing was also made, is 15 miles by road from the centre of Bandar Abbas, The N/S strip is 8?5 yards long and the NE/SW strip about 600 yards; extension in any direction would entail filling a number of nullahs, some of which are very wide and deep.

He was in charge of the erection and equipment of the Factory at DOSHEN TAPPER which he feels might now be rescusitated for the production of Chipmunks under licence. He has had long talks with General SEPAHPOUR, Head of the Air Force, nnd other senior Air Force officers whom he knew well in the past, and has imbued in them some enthusiasm for his ideas* 28. On the civil side he has seen Mr EbtehaJ (Iranian Airways) and Colonel SADIGHI (Eagle Airlines) and han given Mr EbtehaJ a few ideas on economical aircraft operation; he has yet to see Mr Chafik. It is possible that his visit will impell the Persian authorities to make more use of their existing facilities and to come more closely into contact with this long established British firm.

The Regent of Iraq arrived on 14th June with a considerable entourage in four De Havilland Doves, He used two Iranian Airways aircraft on 22nd June to fly him to MESHED and back, and returned to Iraq the following day, 2* Deputy Chief of General Staff . General SHAFAI has retired from the Army on acoount of ill health. Among the more important responsibilities taken over by the remaining Deputy, General KHOSROVANI, is that of the Machine Gun Factory, which is equipped with extremely good machinery but which is at present working at a very low capacity. Whether or not he has Air Force interests sufficiently at heart to be able to use some of the factory's capacity in its interests or in the interests of civil aviation remains to be seen. IRANIAN AIR FOR CE 3* Hurricane Re giment . The Regent of Iraq's arrival spurred the Regiment to unusual activity; six aircraft were sent to intercept him a.t HAMADAN ' and mother six about half way to Hamadan. There were errors in the timing of the Regent's aircraft and undoubtedly also errors in the Hurricane Regiment's ideas of interception. In the event, the twelve Hurricanes failed to main contact and appeared over Me hr ab ad when the Regent and his entourage were driving derm the road away from the airfield. 4# 'Whilst the Regent was in Teheran two exercises were carried out at LASHKARAK, about 13 miles N.E. of Teheran. The excercises, which consisted of attanks against ground targets using practice rockets, 250 lb. bombs and cannon, were reported to be satisfactory and of a reasonable standard of accuracy - no foreign Attaches were invited to n/ttend. During the period of the Regent's stay the Hurricane Regiment completed about 120 hours flying. 5. Serviceability of the Hurricanes remains at a satisfactory standard although shortages of spares, ma.ny of \liich appear to be almost unobtainable, may ultimately reduce the serviceability materially. Glycol is no longer on imminent worry as 400 gallons arrived recently. The engine situation is also satisfactory with 47 spares. 6. The Regiment has been fairly active over the last three months, monthly flying averaging about 15J hours. The total flying time since the Regiment was formed is somewhere between 3,500 and 4,000 hours. 7# Hawker Term . Mr PETERS, who now heads the Team, Mr PATERSON of Rolls Royce and Mr LIKEMAN, the radio instructor, ha.ve all been acked if they would be willing to extend their contracts, which expire next February, for a further two years. It has been pointed out that a new contract would in fact involve a considerable increase in pay over the original contract, the present difference being now borne by the Hawker Company.(Summary No.2/49, para12) 8. YALng Commander E.P.P. GIBBS, D.F.C. was in Teheran for a few days at the end of the month on his way back to the United Kingdom after ferrying a Tempest to India.. He saw no good reason for making an official call at/ 3 »••• • - 2 - the Embassyix&gt;r on the Iranian authorities. It is understood that he left the Lebanon unuer an unpleasant cloud a short time a^o after having contracted to be the flying instructor to the Lebanese Air Force. _U• S. Equipment . A further 2A Thunderbolts have arrived during the month bringing the total not/ to 36. Colonel GIAPAI (last referred to in Summary No. 16/48, para.6) has been posted to command the Thunderbolt ’'Regiment' though it is uncertain yet hou many aircraft he is expected to ra Jf ° r ■ fcho unit vdll be given Regiment status; Captain KHADEMI |thc Shah’s personal pilot) is edso to fly Thunderbolts. The reason for these posting is obscure as neither of the officers tras sent to Germany to complete the Thunderbolt course whereas Colonel MIRI, C.O. of the Hurricane Regiment, together v/ith a number of his officers were. 10. Various derogatory statements have been heard about the Thunder bolts, many of them from a reliable source; they cannot therefore be discounted, and the chief of them are featured below as an indica.tion of the reaction of many yho ha.ve reason to be interested in these latest additions to the Persian Air Force aircraft strengtji; — (a.) The two N.C.Os responsible for the maintenance and training technicians have no experience of the type; as far as is kno\m this is substantially correct as the N.C.Os were gj.ven only a short conversion course before coming here. (b) Some of the N.C.Os a.re in any case not very reliable, and an N.C.O.(who was subsequently returned to the United States for beating up an Iranian in a brawl in one of the hotels in Teheran) wno ..as reputed to be an expert on Dakotas admitted himself that throe years previously he was the manager of a skittle alley. (c) There are no maintenance publications. (d) None of the U.S. personnel involved are aware of the types of hydraulic fuel and oil for use in the airframe and engine auxilli ary mechanisms. (e) There are no spares and cannibaJisation is not a satisfactory method of maintaining aircraft. (f) There are few tools and what toold there are, which were brought back by Colonel DUNN who has now recovered from an illness which necessitated his going to Germany, are themselves in bad order. (g) It will be difficult for inexperienced pilots to operate the aircraft from the 2,000 yard runways at OATEN MORGEEH. II* . ^ inc ? tho Thunderbolts arrived only two of them have flown, and hen by U.-S, pilots, and Colonel GHARAI is becoming very eager to see m take the air. The U.S. Mission are naturally anxious that they should not be flown extensively until their maintenance can be to some degree guarantee u, but if the delay in the rarer aft becoming operational is prolonged much further it will be an additional factor of exn.eerbe.tion, 1 . • It is understood that a statement was recently forwarded to Hihe Air Force component of tho U.S. Military Mission giving details of equipment and spares required for U.S. aircraft involving an amount of 2,300,000 o .rs, ^ similar statement giving details of demands for military equipment a ? hort a £°&gt; ^ no doubt the Persian authorities hope that t^e goods will be forthcoming gratis. It is believed also that the cost oi tnc U.S. equipment which is earmarked for the Persian Air Force already exceeds the original amount allowed for under the original credit of ten million dollars./ 4« •. • • DOSHAN TilPEEH on /th June, Ho wr.s shovzn around by Colonel A. BAYANDOR; Hr R. 17ALKER of Dc Ho.vill^ndo -.;ao also in attendance. The visit undoubtedly ^ave noro ni.ipiia.sis to Mr ~J; .Iker 5 s su^^cstion about rescusitatin ^the activities of the factory' (Sunnary No*5/49j para,27), and enthusiasm or reooixiencine substantial operations is still running; high, :.Ir Walfeor's sucicstion about rescusitatino proposals have not yet been received, but it is hoped that \*ien they are the enthusiasm vail not be damped to extinction by military bias and financial parsimony, 14.. _ llr CH7iPIK is not very enthusiastic about the idea of producing training aircraft at Doshan Tnppeh, largely because he feels that it is economically unsounn and that Iran v/ill be unable to absorb the output for some tine. He is actively going ahead with a scheme, scnewha.t of a counter proposal, to set up a maintenance organisation at Doshan Tappeh v/hich will tTork both for the Persian Air Force and his ovn Directorate—General., His proposal has not yet got beyond the initial stage of exploratory talks, but there is no doubt 0hat such a scheme would be practicab le — even at present a limited amount of work is done for Iranian Airways at Doshan Tappeh, 15* Deta c hments . Two Hinds were sent to Meshed late in the month to make preparation for the move there (Summary No.4/49, para,10). It is possible that the Arsons at present at Qnlch Horgheh will also be moved to ISF AHAN to leave hangerage for the Thunderbolts. _T r lining nbroa rt,. Colonel H/jiIN Ni^SSARI , vivo is General Khosrovani’s brother-in-law, proceeded to the United Kingdom at the end of the month for some months' language study before entering the Royal Air Force Staff College. He has served on the General. Staff in a number of cushy jobs for a number of yeans, and his only qualification an a technical officer is that he attended a Marconi course in the middle thirties. The result of his Staff College Course is awaited with interest. 17* Iinance, It is believed that the Iranian Air Force authorities have recently authorised the payment of £300 ,000 to certain British firms, including Bristols, to whom debts have been outstanding for a great number of yeans. A ssistant Militar y ntts eho in t he United States, An officer from the Persian Army has been appointed to this post/“ancf'there seems little hope of an Air Attache's post being established to permit Colonel GUHANSHAH to enjoy himself in the States. (Summary No. 15/48, para.8). PERSIAN CIVIL AVIA TION 19. a viation Bills . Mr Chafik is battling hard with his Aviation Bills, He firmly intends to have something to show before the end of the present session of the Majlis, and, if there is little hope of the Civil Aviation Act itself, will introduce a one article law bringing the Act into force on a provisional basis unqualified in so far as time is concerned, 20 * Eagle Airlines . The engines of one of tlx aircraft at Mohrabad were run up on one occasion during the month for the first time since the aircraft ceased to operate. Colonel SADIGHI hopes to be able to persua.de the ^nglo-Iranian Oil Company to instal a new engine, which is being sent from Baghdad, in the unserviceable aircraft at Abadan and then to fly it to Teheran. • i n ^he last few days negotia/tions between the Board, Iranian Airways and Mr Chafik have been going on to decide if and how the Company should be involved in the merged airline - the official decision is not yet known. It is learnt, however, that Mr Ebtehaj's final word was reasonable in that he agreed to Eagles coining into the merger provided £22,500 was set aside for■HMM -V- thc clearance of the B*0.A*C* debt and £10,000 for the overhaul and issue of C* of A 1 s for all three Doves* 22* Iranian Airways , Mr Chafik fea.tured in the first passenger list of the ^e\7 service which wan started to KdVTEIT via Abadan on 3rd June; the service j.s being continued on Mondays and Fridays and is sta.ted to be very popular; there is a possibility th&lt;at its frequency will be increased. The month also saw the resumption of services to liESKT and BABULS AD. 23. The two English pilots from Pak Air arrived during the month, the one Mr A.G-. BOUATEIi- VERNON being an ex-Squadron Leader, and the other Mr ROBERTS being an ex-Flight Lieutenant of the Royal Air Force. Neither . of them had anything creditable to say about Pak Air, and apart from one or two minor problems such as payment for meals when flying on internal services which will no doubt be sorted out, have so far expressed considerable satisfaction with their new appointments, and have had no criticism to make about the standard of aircraft maintenance. They find that they get on better with the officials of Iranian Airways and the people here in general than they did with their contacts in Pakistan. 24. Colonel T, UDRISKY has not lasted very long as Chief Pilot and was discharged from the Company a few days ago owing to some dispute with Mr Ebtehaj, He is still in Teheran, and though it is rumoured that he may be reinstated it seems unlikely as Mr Roberts has been offered the job as Chief Pilot - he was in fact Chief Pilot when working with Pak Air. 25. The Technical Manager, who has continued association with Field Aircraft Services for the overhaul of engines, has complained directly to the Company about technical failures in six engines due to faulty overhaul after they had flown varying periods between 300 end 350 hours. It is unfortunate that this should follow a similar ccrrple.int last Autumn to the same firm about overhauls on a complete aircraft and that, if the Technical Manager is to be believed, similar complaints have been made by airline companies in Greece, the Mb'die East and Pakistan. 26. Iranian State Airline. Mr Chafik has now received authorisation to take over the Rapides of the Iranian State Airline. He intends to use one for his own Department and to use the remaining three for the merged airline when it comes into being. ^7. Aero Clu b. The Aero Club is now operating limited mail services to HAMAD AN a.nd KER1.1ANSHAH, KAZVIN, 2SNJAND and TABRIZ. Completion of the round trip by filling in the present gap between Kermanshah and Tabriz is a probable development in the near future. 28. Meteor olo gical an d Airf ield Equ ipment . It is still difficult to ascertain what quantity of material has definitely been ordered. There is no doubt, however, that Mr Chafik is very impressed by American radio equipment, in which he is no doubt encouraged by Mr R. BALL, a left-over from T.W.A., who acts as his signals advisor, AIRFIELDS 29# Resht, A lanaing was made at Resht during the menth. Though there had been no rain for Gane vTeeks past and the surfa.ee was slfcated to be hard and firm, the Anson v/as bogged when taxying down the runway* prior to take off. The incident took plane about one third of tte width from the Southern edge of the East/West strip.) when about 500 yards from the Eats tern end* The surface appeared quite dry and firm, but in fact this extended to a depth of only about 2' and und.ornea.th the ground v, r as extremely soggy; at •the time the Anson had full main tanks and ca.rried only myself and the fitter# It was eventually manhandled to firmer ground by a portion of the Resht population ably led by the Iranian Airways agent. As stated above, the-5- * * landing ground is no\. r bcin^ regularly used by Iranian Airways; considerable ^.re has to be taken, and the rarer aft take off* and land usinc only about .ie Western two thirds of the East/V/est-strip. 30, Abadan , The contract for rebuilding; the main runway at Abadan has. &amp;one to the local Conpany D.A.S. referred to in Suaniary No.V%9 , para, 18, FOREIGN AIALINES 3'U K.L,M, K.L.M, have a^ain been frequent reference in the press, their bar in the local. French paper of a single double sheet being about seven columns during the month. In fant, so frequent is the appearance of articles about K.L.M, and its emotivities, that the papier, the Journal de Teheran, is now occasionally referred to as the 'Journal de K.L.M.” - invariably by those who have reason to be jealous of K.L.M 1 s advertising policy. 32. A considerable amount of freight is being brought to Teheran in K.L.M. aircrai't; during one week four aircraft arrived with loads totalling about 20 tons. The Manager in Teheran affirms that in all its aspects the service to Teheran is the most lucrative of the European services. Their methods of obtaining business may not, however, be strictly in accordance with international regulations. It is known that a 50£o reduction in freight rates on a substantial amount of priva.te baggage was recently given to the Minister of a European Legawtion; the Minister now disputes even the charge, FOREIGN SERVICE ATTACHES 33• Russian Assistant Mili tary Attache.

Five Thunderbolts led by Colonel DUNN were more cunning and picked up the Viking about 50 miles from Teheran. Ideas of escort seemed to be tempered with considerable ebullience, and the Viking was shot up for the rest of the Journey up to the final approach, much to the disconcertion and expressed disapproval of the Captain. A boat up of the airfield concluded the exercise, 2. There were no demonstrations by the Air Force in connection with the King's visit* 4* Hawker Team . Though the Hawker Team continue to do their best to encourage Iranian officers to make the most of their instruction, one of the main difficulties is the frequent absence of the pupils. A typical example concerns engine instruction in which 20 officers are supposed to appear each day. In fact, only two regularly report and they show signs of losing interest, not because they are disinterested in the work but because any maintenance difficulty or technical blame is inevitably thrown on them, and will undoubtedly result in their promotion being delayed; whereas the remaining eighteen manage to disappear into dark corners and ploy chess without detriment to their official records, 5. One or two of the Hawker Team continue to affirm that there ore 'parties' in the Iranian Air Force (Summary No.1^/48, para.6). It would seem that these 'parties' amount to two opposing cliques amongst the officers - the one comprising those officers who are eager to get things done to improve the Air Force's efficiency, and the other comprising those who are not interested in the Air Force except for what they can get out of it. General M* SEPAHPOUR is reputed to be in the first category, but is said to lack sufficient willpower to overcome opposition which might eventually force him to take refuge with his opponents. 6. Thunderbolt Regiment . There are now 55 Thunderbolts at QALEH LOR GUSH and pilot training has commenced using the airfield on alternate days with the Hurricanes. Colonel DUNN, who is in charge of Thunderbolt training, states that he has passed 16 pilots on the type and each has done about 8 hours flying. They have now commenced to do formation flying. 7* Lack of tools and spares constitutes the main difficulty in operating the aircraft, and there seems little hope that tine will alleviate the position. Present maintenance activity is measured by the ingenuity of the operators to produce makeshift arrangements with makeshift tools.- 2 - Colonel Dunn himself has been withdrawn from the active list of the U.S,A»P* and shows every inclination to resign and not to continue as a Reserve Officer, Ho has made enquiries about rejoining the Royal Air Force, with which ho served early in the War, Appointments 9* General MOHANNA (Summary No,2/49&gt; para,6) has been temporarily released fran his appointment as Inspector of the Air Force to accompany General MIR JALALI to Europe to negotiate the purchase of small-arms ammunition, and machinery and material for the ammunition factory in Teheran, 10, Colonel K.B. ALA, who left the 2nd Bureau of the General Staff in June for a mark-time job at Air Force Headquarters, has been posted to the new appointment of Service Attache at Kabul, He is to be assisted by an Arcy officer, Lieutenant SAREMI. IRANIAN CIVIL AVIATION 11• Aviation Bills , The Bill dealing with Iran's adherence to the Chicago Convention was approved by the Majlis on 21st July, and a single article law bringing the Civil Aviation Act into operation on a provisional basis v/as eventually passed before the final session of the Majlis on 28th July. 12* Mr Chajfik is being assisted in producing an English translation of the Civil Aviation Act by the Embassy, and intends to publish the original and the translation at an early date, 13» Navigational Fe.cilities , Mr Cha.fik feels tha,t Decca might provide the most suitable means for long range navigation to centres in Iran, and has made enquiries about the projected development of the system outside Europe. 14* Finance . Mr Chafik hopes to get an appropriation in the present Irarirn year's Budget for fifty million Rials (£390,000), With this he intends to concentrate on lengthening and widening the runways at MEHRABAD, to build the Large hangar which was originally featured in the new airport building programme, but which was subsequently dropped, and then to build runways a^t TABRIZ. 15# Air fie Id E quipme nt . Mr Chafik has confirmed tha.t an order has been placed in the United States for 200,000 dollars worth of radio equipment, but that details of individual items still remain to be decided. It is possible that an order for fire tenders and other nncilliary airfield equipment may go to British fims. 16. Iranian Airways . Colonel UDRISKY has now left the Country and has joined Middle East Airlines. Messrs B0WATER-VERNON and ROBERTS are the only pilots who are permitted to fly on the India service, and have, in consequence, been piling up hours since they started active flying with the Company. The pilot situation is still unsatisfactory; apart frem these two there is one South African with no licenses, two Iranians v/ho fly once per week and one French man who, though reasonably well qualified, is not a good pilot. The latter damaged a wing tip v/hen taxying a Dakota in sight of Mr EBTEHAJ' who was preparing to emplane in an Air France .aircraft to proceed to Europe — Mr EBTEHAJ departed in high dudgeon; later in the month the same pilot forced landed near Shiraz, entirely due to bad airmanship. 1?. Mr Ebtehaj will undoubtedly be making enquiries about pilots whilst he is in Europe, but there are few, if any, in England, and the standard of French pilots leaves much to be desired - at least if those who have been in Iranian Airways is -anything to go on. Messrs Bov/ater-Vernon and Roberts find that their pay of Rials 9,000 per month plus £40, convertible if required at the free market rate, is just about sufficient to enable them to live with no margin for saving, and intend approaching Mr Ebtehaj for some increase. Rates for British pilots operating the A.I.O.C. are about •••••••-3- Ummuam c ’ G l^°^. pcr annUL1 ? lus aco orxiodation, and there is therefore some just- u n . f0r ^ i ^ lcre ? se in VW* Thcre is ^ so little doubt that whatever J , ran ^-.

At the srme time -our pilots of the Iranian Air Force, who are qualified on Dakotas according to the American Advisory Mission, are being detached to Iranian Airvrys to fly on internal services, and a further four are to be detached m about two months’ time. This may well provide encouragement to continue operation of the airline in the bad old way* 16. Merged Airline. The nerved airline has still not been established and mth the departure of Hr Ebtehaj of Iranian Airways to Europe natters will no doubt be helc. in abeyance until he returns. Aero Club. Mr Chafik has confirmed that the mail service run will not complete the leg between KERM/1JSHAH and TABRIZ, and thereby complete a n7 t T^u CUl ri r ?°i[ r3e * untj -l work is done on the airfields at 8ANANDAJ and REZ/JYEH. No information is available about 'what ha.s been done, if anything, at the airfield at KEZAIYEH, but it is still Mr Chafik’s firm intention to prepare a landing ground there for use by Dakotas.

General . It is understood that early in the month General M. SEPAHPOUR was informed by the Chief of Imperial Ga&amp;eral Staff that he could divorce the Air Foree f'om day to day dealings with the Ganeral Staff and the Ministry of War, and have a direot responsibility only to the C*I.G.S. himself and the Minister of War. This virtually meant the formation of an independent Air Foree, and in view of the very material advantages which would have accrued it is difficult to know why General Sepahpour should turn the suggestion down. In the event, General Sepahpour has taken a half-way step and thereby caused disgust amongst some of the senior officers; Colonel H. GUIIANSHAH has asked to resign and Colonel A. BAYANDOR (Summary No.2/49, para?) is taking vigorous steps to attend No.8 Staff College Course in England, after which he will also resign unless he sees the Iranian Air Force as a better organised force, 2. Having refused the suggestion. General Sepahpour lias taken advantage of the cessation of Martial Lew in Teheran to occupy the Military Governor’s old olfices, and has brought into his Headquarters organisation the Air Force Department of the General Staff, together with its Head, Colonel ALA'I. The reorganisation which will follow is not yet fixed, but the technical, maintenance and supply side of tte staff will probably iemain at DOSHAN TABEEH. The present arrangement, which puts Colonel Ala’i at General Sepahpour’s right hand, is a further source of irritation ns the former has not seen active Air Force service in recent years and is not popular amongst his compatriots. 3* D etachments . During the month a visit was made to the detachment at MESHED vhich is commanded by Colonel 3HAQAQI. There are at present five Audax, two Hinds and two Tiger Moths in the detachment, and some of the personnel are familiar faces from ISFAHAN. The aerodrome buildings have not been inhabited since the Russian occupation, and the main task at present is to put the establishment on a more presentable footing. Apart from there being no windows the external appearance of the buildings is quite good; externally they are in a patchy condition, and except for the Commanding Officer's chair and table there is no furniture whatsoever. Though it was stated that a fair amount of flying is being done this was not evident during the five days of the visit, 4# Colonel Shaqaqi is a product of French schooling, and though very pleasant showed few signs of bounding vitality or knowledge of up-to-date air matters. Nothing of constructive or instructive interest was being done and the Coxianding Officei himself appeared to lead the way in relaxations to approved working hours. 5* It is intended that the Meshed detachment shall carry out a number of exercises with the Army and also patrol the frontier. The Acting Military Commander, General. SHAFA'I, the younger brother of the le.te Deputy Chief of the Imperial General. Staff, did not, however, appear to take a particularly grea.t interest in what the detachment rare doing or \;hat they intended to do. 6. Two Ansons were sent to ISFAHAN on 8th August and ultimately all will be based there in order to leave room at QALEH MORGHEH for the Thunder bolts.7* Thunderbolt Reginont . The last five Thunderbolts arrived on 15th August after one had. aadc a precautionary landing at KERMANSHAH v/ith engine trouble. At jpresent they are all dispersed around Qaleh Morgheh and tra.ining continues v/ith a li..iited nmber. Many are beginning to r^sune a bizarre appearance as tyros and other parts are removed to keep a fe\7 serviceable. The U,S. Military Mission is ordering one year's spares for -~-vten Thunderbolts and fifteen of those a.t Qaleh Morgheh are being dissembled, the initial dismantling of vvings and propellers taking place at Qaleh Morgheh before despatch to DOSHAN TAPFEH for final break-dov/n, 8, U,S, Military Mission . Colonel W.H, DUNN left Teheran for the United States on 20th August. His departure, and other similar movements \7hich have taken place recently, have caused the Iranian authorities considerable exasperation, particularly as in this case Colonel Dunn's job, on Tvhich he had done a tremendous amount of spade work, was only just beginning, 9» In general,the senior officers with whom one talks feel that they are not getting value for their money with the Mission personnel, and find the members of the Hawker Team much more satisfactory, particularly as they have seme jurisdiction over them. A request has now been made to retain the complete Team, and tnough this request has been turned down once by the Cabinet it is probable that it will be approved by the Majlis when it is ultimately convened. The present members of the Team are Messrs, peters, Paterson, Likeman, Orchard and Strn.tford, the latter two being concerned with the Factory at Doshan Tappeh and airframe maintenance respectively (Summary No,6/49&gt; para.7), 10. Colonel TRUE, the relief for Colonel ADAMS, arrived from Germany towards the end of the month, 11. U.S. Equipment. In addition to the Thunderbolt spares the U.S, Mission is ordering one year's spares for the Dadcotas. The training aircraft which are on order will probably be shipped in a few weeks' time, 12. Dakotas. General RAZMARA is making use of the Dakotas by sending one eejch week with an inspecting party to various Divisional Headquarters in the Country. One aircraft is also being prepared to take a number of officers to France for training courses, and efforts (which are being resisted) are being made to obtain sa.fety equipment a.nd other aids from Iranian Airways. 13* Dress. N.C.Os are in future to wear the American type of chevrons on the sleeves of their shirts and tunics; those so far seen have been pinned on, and detract from the usual fastidious a.ppearance of the apparently broad-shouldered wearers. IRANIAN CIVIL AVI,1 ION 14* Training. Mr CHAFIK is selecting six students from those who have completed University training and obtained Honours Degrees, to send to England for training, two t as radio engineers, two as ground engineers and two as meteorological forecasters. Besides obtaining basic qualifications these students will be expected to organise the various facilities connected with their trades, to carry out inspections, and to recommend the issue of certificates where appropriate, when they return to Iran. 15* Iranian Airways . Mr EBTEHAJ returned during the month from his visit to Europe. Whilst there ho had spent some time with Field Aircraft Services expressing his views about their low standards of overhaul, and also transferred the airframe overhaul contract from Air France to another French fim.16, Mr A. BOWATER-VERNON asked for better financial terns late in the month but was informed that they would not be granted and that he was at liberty to go if he wished; he departed to-day to Beirut to join Middle East Airlines. This la.ttcr company is now understood to be controlled by ^an American Airways which has bought up 51/w of the capital and supplied chree new Dakotas, and which is offering extremely good terms to new crews, Mr Bowater-Vernon’s place is being taken by an ex-Captain of Air Prance who is well qualified and who is prepared to work for the same amount of money. 17, Mr Ebtehaj shows signs of adding a business for printing an English newspaper to his many other interests. 18, Merged Airline . The merged airline has now come into being and wall retain the name of 1 the biggest shareholder, Iranian Airways. Mr Ebtehaj will remain Managing Director, and the Chairman of the Board will probably be Mr HEKMAT, a person who has been a figure of some consequence in Ministerial circles for many years, 19, The latest information, given by Mr Ebtehaj himself, is that Eagle Airlines has a share of Rials 5*000,000, and that the new concern has taken over their debt to the Bank Me Hi of Rials 732,000 and also the three Doves and such spares as are still in the Country, Clearance of the B.0.A.C, debt is still unsettled and all that Mr Ebtehaj is prepared to offer is one of the Doves. Mr Chafik made an independent suggestion to the B.O.A.C. Station Superintendent earlier in the month that the debt of £18,500 ( an entirely arbitrary figure, £4*000 short of B.O.A.CJs figure) should be settled by B.O.A.C. taking one of the Doves at an agreed valuation, the remaining amount being covered by a promissory note realisable in three months, Mr Ebtehaj takes considerable exception to this, and has informed the Station Superintendent that if B.O.A.C. proceed with a writ to recover their money, not only will there be prolonged arbitration but they will be faced with a press campaign which mil not be to their benefit. The ball is back in B.O.A.C's court. 20, The extent of Government backing is still undecided. Iranian Airways have recently obtained an indirect subsidy by the waiver of a substantial percentage of customs duties, revenue is thus increased, and Mr Ebtehaj is correspondingly not eager to see Government interference on the operations side. His latest idea is that the Government should set up a maintenance organisation from which he will obtain servicing and repair facilities at cost plus a small percentage profit. .21, Outside the Merger . The Iranian Military Attache in the United States has evidently interested a number of Iranians and Americans there in the idea of floating another airline in Iran. At this end General Razmara is taking an active interest. It is envisaged that only 20^ of the capital will be owned by Iranian nationals, and as this is contrary to the provisions /and of the Civil Aviation Act/a Civil Aviation Board has also to approve the formation of new companies, it is unlikely that Iranian Airways in its new form will see this Irano-Amorican competitor in operation. 22. Publicity . Tw of the rooms at MEHRABAD Airport were converted into a picture gallery on 21st August for Mr Chafik to display a number of paintings by two French artists. The combination of modern and objective styles was. not pleasant to many eyes, but though the comments were variable the occasion did give an opportunity of getting a crowd, of diplomats to Mehra.bad for reasons other than seeing off or meeting their friends./ 5 *• ♦ •• AIRFIELDS -V ■—23.

The Embassy Doctor providentially returned from leave the same day, and the combined effort resulted in the Consul's wife, being put safely on the road to recovery. 34# Major Wambold proceeded to Beirut with his Ambassador the following week and returned a few days ago. 33* R ussian Embassy .
