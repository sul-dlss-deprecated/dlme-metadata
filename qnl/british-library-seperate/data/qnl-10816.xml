Under the conditions are three schedules: 1) landing fees, assessed according to the maximum weight authorised by the aircraft’s airworthiness certificate; 2) housing fees, assessed according to the span and maximum length of the aircraft; and 3) charges for attendances and facilities, which are not given, having not been set at the time of the printing of the regulations.An appendix includes text for the form used for the authorisation of aircraft to land in Muharraq and fly over Bahrain.The two copies of the regulations vary slightly.
