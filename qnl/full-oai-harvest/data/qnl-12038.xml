An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-162; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence between ff 99-183, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out. The foliation sequence does not include the front and back covers, nor does it include the leading and ending flyleaves</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns Post Office buildings at Gwadur [Gwadar].The papers cover: correspondence concerning the Post Office boundary; sketch plans of sites; the disposal and sale of buildings (the 'Old Political Bungalow' and the 'Inspection Bungalow') to the Government of Muscat and Oman; well; correspondence concerning the erection of wire fencing around the Post Office building; and related matters.The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Muscat; the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department; the British Agent, Gwadar; and officials of the Government of Muscat and Oman.The Arabic language content of the papers consists of approximately twenty folios (most with English translations), mainly correspondence between the Political Agent, Muscat, and officials of the Government of Muscat and Oman.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Posts and Telegraphs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Gwadur</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Post offices</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000bb#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000bb#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000bb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
