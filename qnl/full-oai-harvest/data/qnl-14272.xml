Merewether goes on to discuss the potential damage Phayre could have done, and the course of action he had been recommending.Also discussed are affairs in Seistan [Sīstān] and the attitude of the Persian Commissioner there which has prevented the boundary settlement occuring, resulting in the decision having to be taken at Tehran. Also discussed is Charles Alison's departure from Tehran and the risk that the choice of successor for him may have an impact on the outcome of the settlement.The letter concludes by discussing relations between Torkee [Turki bin Said] and Abdool Azeez [Abd'al Aziz al Said], the governorship of Gwadur [Gwadar] and the need for the British Government to settle the Zanzibar subsidy, proposing that Bergash [Bargash bin Said] could be freed from it provided he agreed to revise the slavery treaty.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517966.0x000023#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
