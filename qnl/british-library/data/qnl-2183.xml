Sir, I have the honour to forward, for your inform- - .'■» 3 ' ' »:**•*. 4» 4, . ation, 2 articles which appeared in the Basra paper called 'AL THAGAR* under date 29th December 1933. 2* When you were at Kuwait, you may recollect that I was able to show you one of the articles, and you suggested that His Excellency the Shaikh might cause a dignified reply to be written, pointing out the utter stupidity of the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government had any idea of setting up a ’Special* iirab Kingdom in the Gulf, consisting of a combination of Arab States, with the capital at Basra. 3* I mentioned the matter to His Excellency, and he has carried out your suggestion, though I have not seen his ’inspired’ reply yet. 4. The articles, I think, are worth passing on to His Majesty’s Government, for the simple reason that unless denied they will put quite wrong ideas into the heads of a large number of persons in the Gulf who will undoubtedly read them. 5 a His Excellency the Shaikh thinks that it would be as well if some form of official Government reply were sent to the 'AL THAGAR” denying the truth of the articles and pointing out that the writer’s motives areare obviously anti-English. His Excellency thinks the articles, if left unchallenged, are capable of doing a great deal of harm if they have not done so already.

Hassaj the 1 Iraq CJovarnmant* with its port of Basrah and the Far elan l&amp;apire possessing the Eastern shore stretching from Moha raise rah as far as Baluchistan* The British politicians cannot rest without safeguarding their interests in the Gulf and strengthening their influence thereon* These facts are too well known to the politicians of •Iraq, Saudi g Government and Persia. Britain's eager ness to protect the Indian Empire is the main cause for the policy that led to the countries on the way coming under the sway of the Colonial Bepartrasnt, the source of calamity and affliction to the East* It is strongly rumoured here that there appears to be a dangerous attempt afoot, inspite of the difficulties that it may encounter - briefly the purport of the rumour circulating, indicates that the Political brains of the Colonial Department in London, contemplate forming a new Kingdom in the Gulf, to include all the Arab Princedoms, that are already under British influence, adding to them Katif and ,11 Basse, and so Basrah, thereby composing a strong front against Persia's embitions, which are clearly supported by the aoviat, who have lately been very active in getting closer to certain Eastern countries, viz Turkey and Persia, with the object of forming an Eastern League of Nations, as a block against Europe's colonizing policy, and her intrigues* That there is truth in the rumour can be observed which is kept by from the stringent watch/the Persian Government on her eastern shore of the Gulf, and the handing over of the whole administration to the Military* We are informed by i a visitor from that side that none of the inhabitants are \ allowed to approach any ship that has cast anchor in Persian waters, without obtaining previous sanction from the Police authorities - added to this the contemplated conference of Arab Rulers, of which the ;a*abie Press, as also the 'Thaghar*, had hitherto reported on.3 As far as # Iraq is concerned, British colonial policy would like to see absorbed in it Palestine and Trans-Jordan, thereby raing the Haifa-Baghdad Railway line m •Iraq line, and its cost borne by •Iraq: Haifa becoming the Port for •Iraq in the Mediterranean instead of Basrah, which is intended as the capital of the Gulf Kingdom, as they pro|K&gt;se* The people of Basrah with many different elements, do not welcome the idea (if there be such plan) to separate It from v Xraq« Nor do they desire a change under any circumstances* Even H.E.Ibn Baud would not agree to give up Katif and Hassa, even if the colonial party were to finance him with golden pounds, and stregthen his resources and Invited him to place his son as a King and Head of the new Kingdom* He, Bin Baud, is far from being deceived by these attempts, even if there be behind the scenes one thousand and one Philbya* This is vtxat is being whispered in our ears here* fe for our part are compelled to believe in the truth of these rumours, because without fire there is no smoke* But we ask those in whose hands lie the destinies of the Gulf to wake up and watch this anticipated and dangerous attempt, and to stand against this colonizing group bravely. iVe ask them to consolidate their attempts and check this flood before it engulfs this part of the Bast. Negligence on the part of the ruling heads concerned may give an open ing and opportunity for them to fulfil their desire, which God forbids should ever take place*Translation of an article which appeared in the Basra paper n Al Thagar” on 29th December 1933« THE DANGER OF COLONIZATION IN ARABIA. We have previously reproduced an article frcm the Egyptian newspaper, named like ourselves 'The Thagar' and printed in Cairo in December 1931, headed 'The Arab World is not a separate number of Nations, but one Arab Nation”. In this article we discussed the Arab case and showed the danger likely to arise to the Arab countries if the attempts of European Governments to colonize Arabia became a success and pointed out the hellish plans and artifices that would If likely'be and were being tried, and gave examples of how the colonial group intended to work to separate the con solidated group of Arabian Amirats into a number of small groups, and we showed how the Arabs might get to work and counteract these attempts to divide. It is Arab unity that will enable the Arab nation to check the colonial ambitions (of Europe) and to obtain a status similar as that enjoyed by Europe. We stated that in that article that one of their plans would be to pit the Rulers of the different provinces of the Jazirat al Arab one against the other and by weakening them, open their countries to the colonial idea of things. There is no question of the fact that at the present day the Jazirat al Arab is strong, but the colonial gang are continuously working to undermine this strength by starting war in the Jazirat and so causing the Rulers there to lose their strength and thus give the outside powers an opportunity to occupy their countries and benefit from their great resources, and develop their priceless mineral wealth. The dispute that has lately arisen between th King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud and the Imam Yahiya Hamid al Din proves what we predicted three years ago in the previousprevious article mentioned. But whatever the reason for their dispute, we hope the wisdom and far-sightedness of both these royalties will enable them to checK and abstan from war. 7e know that if v/ar occurred between them it would result in bringing the shores of the Gulf, the Ked Sea, nay also the rest of the Jazirat, into the toils of the colonizing groups. All who are acquainted with the affairs of the Jazirat al Arab know well that there are secret and underhand occurrences being carried out by the emissaries of these Governments, which if effective and successful will enable these colonis ing Governments to fulfil their desires. Headers should study the state of affairs in the Jazirat and the political changes that hav© taken place in the last few years especially and which we intend now to lay before them. Prior to tha great War the Lutasarifiat of Al Hasoa and under it the ^aimaqamate of Hat if were under the Vilayat of Basrah while Kuwait, Bahrain and ^atar were administered by their own native chi els. t lie Kingdom of Nejd was ruled by I BN KASHIN from the capital of Jibal Shammar (Hail) and all acknowledged the suzerainty of the Ottoman Government as their Khalifah as also did the liedjaz, which was ruled by a ..all, assisted oy the oharifs of Mecoa and Medina. And Yemen which with Assir was governed by a Mushir; Muscat which was supposed to control oh@ adjoining principalities of Ghargah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi - all how ever acknowledged the Khalifah of Islam Ihe Bui tan of iurkey. Aribistan or Khuzistan as it is now named by the Persians, waj ruled by its own native Bhaikhs under one paramount native Prince, enclosed in a frontier stretching from Khorrumabad to Behbehan and down to Bandar Pig in the littoral of the Gulf. This Arab Prince of Khuzistan held e# «© a powerful sway over his country and tribes, so much so that he only accepted to give to the Khaja Regime of Persia a nominal3 nominal submission. The Eastern Coast of the Gulf from Bandar Rig to nearly Bandar Abbas was known as Fars with a population of over one million, who comprised in their groups, certain Arab tribes settled there sine® the Islamic conquests of Persia also Persians and a large Turcoman groups under the title of Khan or (^owam and only submitted to the the great War. At the present time, the Saudi Government has replaced the Rashid Rule in Arabia, The Imam has taken over Yemen. Hedjaz is Saudi. The Khaja Government has been replaced by the Palavi in Persia, who has enforced a strong rule. But all these are now threatened with the advance of the colonising group of Britain, and already the Western Coast has come into its claws which has replaced the rule of the Khalifat. The heads of this colonial group which have planned to play on the above mentioned states ; with intent to bring them more under their grasp, view with fear to their plans the idea of one consolidated Arab Nation, and so they watch intently for every or any onnortunity to and Hedjaz and the Imam Yahya of Yemen, for, if their machinations are successful they will be able to attain two important results towards their colonizing ambitions: known as the Khashganies. These were all ruled by ch^iefs Khaja dynasty in name. The above was the position of the Jazirat at Arab and the Gulf Coast line in the days before (a) The breaking up of the consolidated nine principalities of Yemen end Assir, which form the Kingdom of the Imam Yahya: (b) The strengthening of their hold in the Gulf (They are ambitious to obtain a hold on A1 Hassa Qatif, which a strong national Arabian oombino would make impossible)- 4 it 5 A Under the foregoing it will be observed that the colonizing Department’s policy obviously is to arrange that the Assir question should not be settled except by the sword, and this is likely to be the case, At the present juncture ^ certain other colonizing Nation also with ambitions in the tvsttleA Uj** Red Sea, and who hh^e economic and political relations with Yemen, has, it is stated, equipped Yemen with arms via Eodeidah and Sanaa, and the great Colonizing Power of the Gulf (England) has commenced sending equal amounts of arma ments or perhaps less to Nejd through Uibail and the Hassa route* Why all this assistance? What is meant by such aid? The echoes we hear from the Gulf nowadays have a new tone. What we want to hear is ft The Gulf for the people of the Gulf”, But everything helps to explain to us the meaning of the military assistance as being a preliminary to the establishing a Kingdom in the Gulf, which idea has resulted from the though' -ful brains of the colonizing politicians. Undoubtedly the outbreak of War in the Aazirat will be the separation of the ni ne protected principalities from the Imam of Yemen; the cutting off of Qatif and A1 Hassa from the Saudi Government - which events will allow of the colonial group to form an Arab Kingdom in the Gulf, We doubt if they will be successful in causing an outbreak of War bet ween the Imam and the Saudi Government as we fully believe both parties have sufficient experience to foresee the danger, but we ask the King of ’Iraq, Ghazi I, and all leaders of the Arab nation to throw in their influence in persuading the two parties mentioned from going to War. Not only for the interests of the Yemen and Saudi Government, but for the safety of the whole Arab Nation.COHiTTS iOTIitL.

'A MESSAGE FROM KUWAIT' THE PERSIAN GULF EMIRATES - WILL THEY' BECOME A UNITED KINGDOM? We are accustomed, from time to time to read in the daily papers, certain gossip and news to do with the affairs of the Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf, and every time we read something of this nature we have approached the cognizant sources to find if it was true. We, however, are sorry to have to say that we have always found these tit bits of intelligence to be without found ation and efforts of the imagination only. Recently we have read an article which appeared ii the 'A1 Thagar' (Basra) newspaper under the title ' A Kingdom of Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf', in which the writer treated the affairs of Arabia in their various aspects, and sorrowfully lamented the stati of division to which the Arab nation has been reduced, and gave a detailed account of the intrigues of a certain (foreign) government^ and the attempts which were being made by it to bring about a federation of the Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf, including Eassa, ^atif, with Basra (the sea port of the rising Kingdom of the Rafidein - ’Iraq - ) as a Capital. We are indeed greatly astonished to think that any person can spend so much of his time in scribbling such a long article on such a fanciful subject as this. Sven if we were to take it for granted that there possibly existed some such plan as propounded by- 3 - friend and jealous patriot to turn his attention to what adds to the welfare of his country, instead of rising meaningless riddles* From: Your Own Correspondent.

As the mail is to leave to-morrow morning, I have had no time to get the articles translated by my Vernacular Staff, so I om sending th® papers in original, {relative portions marked in red). 4. His Excellency the Shaikh who is following the articles very carefully, takes a most serious view of f! than and has himself three times urged me to draw your attention to them with a view to getting His Majesty's &lt; Government to lodge a strong protest against their con tinued publication, with the 'Iraq Government.5 0 Great mischief is being done, says His Excellency amongst an ignorant Arab and Persian public, who invariably believe that what appears in a newspaper must be true.

A HETORH TO AM GOT SET. A geographical survey of the Persian Gulf shows that it is surrounded on East, North and West by a littoral of low lands which are not much above sea level, thus rendering communication between its people so easy that nothing seems to obstruct their intercourse save the political position of their relative territories, religion language, social manners and even geographical position being on© and the same. Tlie hinterland, however, have variant altitudes, and son® are marked by marked features, especially the eastern coast, on which a range of high mountains extending fron Kermanshah to Baluchistan lies and rakes a natural barrier, which divides it from the interior of Persia, and which is traversed by a few gorges, the only routes connecting the sea ports with the inlands towns. After this short prelude w© may now turn to our main subject. The English consider that the maintenance of their influence in the Persian Gulf is most essential for the defence of their great Indian Empire, and for the preservation of their imperialistic prestige in the East. Hence their ambit ions in the Gulf, which arise from no desire to gain the mastery over certain economic and commercial resources, as in other countries, but to achieve certain political objects, which will ecntribute to their military suzerainty and make all efforts to drive them out of the Gulf absurd and most impossible. It is nothing to be wondered at if the friendsfriends of colonisation introduce the idea of a Gulf Kingdom at a time when the governments of the East are all endeavour -ing to unite their efforts for opposing all imperialistic influences, especially in the Persian Gulf waters, as the activities of the Persian Government have lately shown, What a device? The Gulf for the Gulf people? Can this be true where the actual executive side is con cerned? The saying is, 'The end justifies the means', and on this principle the British Admiralty and Secretariats ©f War and Air want to achieve their ends. Hence they have introduced the idea of forming a new Kingdom out of the group of the Persian Gulf coasts, which will nominally be a national union, but actually a base for their troops and Air Force, and a station for their * sea power, which are all essential for the defence of India. This is the real object of the stirring up ©f a new national feeling (which we see) for thereby they are creating a complicated problem, with which to ccnfront the Powers that are interest -ed in these territories, especially the Persian Government# The English, who are masters in politics, and who are in possession of a tremendous sea power, exercise great influence at the Courts of all governments - these English people are now making a serious experiment. Their success depends on the nature of the political difficulties and international problems, which will confront them, and which will not yield except after the exertion of extraordinary efforts and the endurance of much sacrifice* \ A careful examination of the s^tate of affairs in the East proves the existence between imperialistic Powers, of secret treaties, which are the outcome of inter national struggles over eastern territories* The object of these treaties is the co-operation of the Western nations to colonize the East and subdue Eastern Nations# If we turn to the past, we shall see that there once existed a secret treaty between the British Government and Imperial Russia, according t© which Persia was dividedit ^ divided into three main sections: (a) the southern section, which comprised the provinces of Khuzistan, Fans and Baluchistan and which formed the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf; this was put under the British influence, (b) The northern section, which comprised the Provinces of Khorasan and Adhrabaijan and the coast of the Caspian sea; this was put under the Russian influence* (c) The central section, which comprised the interior towns of Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd, etc; this was left for the Shah, to be a neutral State and a boundary to prevent collision between the two other influences. But soon after the fall of Czarist Russia and the rise of the Soviet Russia, matters took an entirely different course, and this aggressive treaty became null and void. The English consequently lost their influence in Persia, especially when the last Shah of the Kajar Dynasty was dethroned, and His Majesty Reza Shah took hold of the reins of government , who by his wisdom and strong will was able to save his country from the awful state of anarchy and a decay, raise it up to an impregnable state of power and dignity, utilize the aversion existing between the English and the Bolsheviks, and drive the English out of the southern regions of his Kingdom. Not satisfied with all this, he is still trying to force the English to evacuate the Gulf, as they have already evacuated its eastern shores. From the above we can clearly see that the idea (of a new Gulf Kingdom) is not a novelty, it is an old device of the English who tried to enforce it after the Great War, but were obstructed by the revolution which then occurred in Russia, What has now induced than to start the idea anew, nobody knows. But the future will, no doubt, disclose it. Nevertheless, we are sure that the Persian Government will be on the watch to overthrow this seriousA — serious plan, which would shake the position ol* all governments who are interested in the Gulf, and we are sure also that as long as aversion continues to exist between the Jinglish and the -Bolsheviks — and we have no doubt that it will, in view of their discordant policies - this new Kingdom will never come into existence. Therefore we may rest assured that this idea, which occupies the minds of the sages of imperialisn, shall have failure as its lot, because it is inconsistent with the local ideas. v@ write this by reason of what we have recently read in the 'Ath Thaghr' newspaper, by its correspondent in Kuwait, who holds that our treatment of the Persian Gulf question is false and fabricated. We write to say that the news originated from an authentic source , which is in full contact with the British statesmen, and that we wrote our previous articles for nothing but serving the eastern public interest and warning the eastern Governments against the snares, which are being set for their destruction also to point out that the idea of creating a Gulf Kingdom is not the product of today, as this gentleman correspondent (from Kuwait) thinks, but was initiated a long time ago, and has passed through many stages since then*or not thuy ar* oo«imw«d with »iridity bv the Arab public at. larre. ana help to form Arab public opinion with which ootmer or later ne hawe to aenl, ^hu» whenever po«a ible, a a on the prefien* occaaion, 1 think It well worth while to attempt some di a erect «s#the£ of anti- propaifflccdi ft • ’ Tie of Taunt ^hliaer at on am! hi • lofty at eta® ^ T erer ernlain** are Xoiiff mat and yone.

My dear Sir Trenchard, Many Arabic newspapers of the Middle East seen to be mailing an unusual effort to interest their readers in the Persian Gulf and ooutfvsrn ^rabia— Aden and Hadramant, and the articles now appearing give inaccurate and malicious pictures of Britain’s actions in these areas. This special attention of the Arab Press is something new in the last few months. I have sent you some of the articles and I could send you many more, as His Highness and others here send me the papers when they have articles laentioning the Gulf or Arabia proper. 2. Individually the articles are of little importance, but in the aggregate they seem worthy of some attention, since they no doubt come to hove effect on Arab readers hereabout, and I wonder if you would like the Agency to forward to you translations, or alternatively notes and summaries of the articles, whichever may appear suitable in each case?. 5 . If the articles continue to be published at the present rate this will take up much ti e of the Vernacular clerk. Perhaps you might think this worth discussing when you next came here?.

Amirates situated on the Gulf of Basra (Persian), it is small in size and extent and great in situation and importance, it is a neighbour to Iraq., not very far from Basra, and it is also a neighbour of Nejd and is con sidered to be the nearest port, in the Persian Gulf, to Riyadh. differences arose bet?jeen the Saudi and Kuwaiti Govern ments about the Customs revenues, which both sides have been unable to settle for the last fifteen years - until the news comes this week about the visit of Major Dickson, the British Political Agent at Kuwait, to Riyadh and that he met and spoke to H.M. King Abdul Aziz about the matters in dispute and returned with luck and success. Though we are pleased about the settlement of the dispute, and the sinking of the differences yet, we are pained and every Arab is pained to note that settlement should come through the hands of an Englishman, then people would say that the Arabs cannot settle their own ordinarily simple differences, and an Englishman comes in and effects settlement without the least effort, this, we hope will not occur again in future. Whatever can be done through the Englishman should be done by the Arabs themselves by their own wish and will, and they should The Amirate of Kuwait is one of the Arab Due to the closeness of these neighbours someand they should not lenve for these an opening for interference in their own affairs specially such matters as Customs revenues which are purely internal, it is sufficient for the Gulf Arabs to remember what they had from the British, they are the disease behind their troubles. their efforts in promoting ignorance in the Gulf and in opposing every movement made by the Arabs which is likely to lead to their uplifting and advancement so that they may remain masters and rulers of the country, anybody who doubts this should listen to this true story of the freedom of action taken by the British Adviser at Bahrain (the neighbour of Kuwait) who issued instructions that anyone who writes to or communicates with an Arabic newspaper will be sentenced to six months jail, and a fine of Bs.200/-. that one of the youths of Bahrain has sent a message to me, with the request that I should destroy it after persual, as he fears that the English Adviser at Bahrain might get in touch with some Englishmen in Egypt, and obtain the original of the message, and then through the writing, might know the identity of the writer and woe betide him if he is known, he will not be safe from imprisonment and deportation. Why? Bee axis e he wrote an article in an Arabic newspaper criticising a bad satisa action taJken by some British Officer in the Gulf of Basra, most of such actions are very bad. Add to this their closing of the doors of these Amirates in the face of every Arab, however important he may be, I have THE BRITISH AT BAHRAIN We regret to record here against the British I would like to mention, for historical record learnt through a reliable source that they have preventedprevented the visit of the late Yasin Pasha al Hashimi to Kuwait, he reached Basra a little time Before the resignation of his ministry, he sent from there for a visa to visit Kuwait which was delayed and only reached him after he left Basra on his way to Baghdad, he received it at Amara and declined to return, this was a perfect plan made By the British to prevent the Pasha’s visit to Kuwait, this is what they generally do to prevent every AraB who wishes to visit these Amirates, we mis ht return to the discussion of this matter at another opportunity. THE CAUSES OF DISAOREEMEHT. #e return, after these, details, to the dis cussion of the causes of disagreement Between the two Governments of Saudi AraBia and Kuwait and can say that they are on the following two points: - 1» Customs revenues, and Nejd’s demands of a share in it. 2. The fixing of the frontiers. The first occurred in 1921, when Nejd demanded a share in the Customs revenues of Kuwait on the plea that all merchandise imported to Kuwait is ultimately sold in the markets of Nejd, and is consumed By the people of Nejd and not of Kuwait, therefore,they asked for a share of the revenues received. The Kuwait Government replied that what they receive is as Customs revenues, and as it did not exceed 5$, was insufficient to cover their own expenditure, and that they could give up anything out of it, and that it is up to the Saudi Government to establish their own Customs on the frontier, and receive their own dues instead of extract ing from Kuwait a part of its small income. This reply was unacceptable to Riyadh aid it issued an order for bidding their subjects from trading with Kuwait, which they call 'Musabalah* with Kuwait (?), and which is-4 tiioli is internationally known as “breaking of economic a] relations. This had the Effect of preventing the Nejdis from trading with Kuwait, and they had to look for some other port in Nejd, on the Persian Gulf from which to import. This had a harmful effect on the trade and economics of Kuwait, hut it did not paralyze her and she had preserved her importance all through these long years. It (Kuwait) put out some suggestion, and made some efforts to bring about an understanding between the two Governments the last of which resulted in the visit of a Saudi deputation headed by H.E. Shaikh Hamad al Sulaiman, the Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia. The object of his visit was to discuss the Customs problem., and he returned without being able to come to an agreement. The other point of dispute is that of the frontier which is not settled upto the present, and the importance of which is increased by the rumour of oil being available on the frontier, to which both parties claim ownership, and in 1935 newspapers published some news about the Saudi Government having turned away the men who were sent by Kuwait to prospect for oil with the plea that the grounds belong to them, though this story was not confirmed officially. The work was stopped there. fILL THE AlflH OF KUWAIT VISIT HKDJAZ. Special information has been received that H.H. the Amir of Kuwait Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir intends to visit Pledjaz this year and to make the Haj pilgrim age, but this means to return the visit of King Abdul Aziz who visited Kuwait officially on Thursday 30th January 1936, and was met by great demonstrations of welcome and remained there as the guest of the Amir-5- ,■*** \ ^ / &gt; • the Amir at Dasmen Palace, the pride of the palaces of Kuwait, and its most important one. The Amir visited Hiyadh in April 1953- The time of the visit of the Amir to Hedjaz is not finally fixed, as yet, hut most prohahly it will he about the end of the month of Dil-Qa'da, hy land. He will travel to Mekka hy ®ar and it will take two days to reach there from Kuwait. We have no doubt that the Amir will he greatly welcomed in Hedjaz, in recognition of the bonds of friendship and love which exists since long between the houses of al-Sa’ud and al-Subah, both of which are from the same descent, that is from Habi’a. It is well known that King abdul-Aziz has spent a major part of his life in Kuwait, as the guest of Shaikh Mubarak al Subah grand father of Shaikh Ahmed, the present Amir. Political circumstances has necessiated Ibn Sa*ud*s father Abdul- Hahman to leave Hejd in the end of the last century. At that time Abdul Aziz was a boy dependent on his father. He lived in Kuwait and v/hen he attained manhood he continued the struggle and rebuilt the Saudi Dynasty and moderised it.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 680-S of 1967.

Transition of an article published in the Basra weekly newspape 'Al-Sejil' of 27th 1938.6 Translation of an article in the Basra weekly newspaper H A1-Sejil» of 27th May, 1938. BE GEKTLB 0 EDITOR OF AL^-SEJIL . In your last issue there was an article against the firm and erect pole of Hulership in Kuwait in which you directed hitter criticisia against the innocent and heroic administration of the State. There is no douht that this is a sin, for which it should he your duty to atone hy a good act. How can it he, that Kuwait, which takes pride in her hws and the Hulership, is the only one amongst all Gods* own countries, which helps her strong neighbours to promote their propaganda, although they may not he of her own religion, and adverse to her interests. Here is an example to prove my assertion. There is a protestant American foundation, a Hospital, choked full by the sick of the Muslim Kuwaitis, who fall a prey to their continuous religious preachings, prayers, and verses of Church hymns. Each morning its compound is full of patients including the rich, whose wealth is extracted from them by every possible means. They are compelled, by its being the only hospital in Kuwait, to come to it although it lacks proper and sufficient materials, owing to which many of the patients have passed away, a sacrifice to lack of attention. The A%irate has helped these As Americans by allowing them to import all their materials duty free, notably religious books, and although this respectable Amirate receives Customs duty on all books imported or exported from Kuwait, even the Holy Koran. Forbearance in religious matters has reached its utmost, and some Imams and Kuazzins do not come for morning prayers and no heed is given to the complaints of members of the2/ ° - 2 - of the congregation* Amongst the good acts, upon which none has cemented, of this Amirate, is its being the only one which has an admirable speciality of imposing internal Customs duties, as no one of the dwellers of the small villages of Kuwait, such as Jahra, Fantas etc., can take out from Kuwait City a single bag of rice or any other necessary foodstuff, without payment of one rupee, or more, per bag* The people of Kuwait look forward to the foundation of / schools with much eagerness, and they have been for the last thrity years trying to open schools and a free State Hospital, but they met with bitter opposition from Shaikh Mubarak, grandfather of the present Amir. The great toleration of the Kuwaitis has promoted them to name the Mubarakiyyah school so to please that late Amir, and the other Ahmediyyah school as a mark of encourgement and a constant reminder to the present Amir to proceed towards progress, even at a slow pace! The hope of the people for a hospital was swept away by one angry mood from H.H. Shaikh Mubarak. The present state of affairs in Kuwait does net permit anyone to instil into it a life of enlightment and activity, or the freeing of the public from ignorance and disease. Anyone who tries to do so will find that canes, whips and imprisonment in the 'shop*, which is well protected from ventilation, are ready for him. His Highness the Amir is very fond of the guitar and its strings and he always keeps very nearer to him those who know how to play it. His overbearing desire, to leave all matters as they were, has promoted him to bring in Propagandists, and converts of Free Masonary, and converts of other sects of self pleasure. As to your bewailings, you newspaper men, advocates of education, lovers of reforms and supporters of personal independence for Individuals, you should know3 knew that there is a wide space 'between you and the demands of His Highness, our Amir the Preux Chevalier, &lt; &gt;i may God preserve him, and his Chief Justice of the Courts, Shaikh Abdulla al-Jabir, who penalizes anyone who does v , not come to his Court, With the first messenger he sends notice, a fine for delaying, cljajfew thousands of ruppes, a matter which has necessitated some of those so penalized to flee away from Kuwait, and take refuge at Zub&amp;ir. about such resentful persons.

It is entitled: ' Kuwait progresses towards Civilisation. ” Arab nationalist circles have approved the creation in Kuwait of a liberal movement having as its aim the realisation of reforms in the Principalty. The success of the movement seemed however doubtful, considering the Amir's strong opposition. But he was forced to yield to the desires of his people and gave his consent to the creation of a Legislative Council, representing the Kuwait population and dealing with all questions of politics, finances, education, etc, as done by all Constitutions in other countries. ' The leaders of the reformist movement are trying to educate the population, hoping that once it is enlightened it will be conscious of its rights and possibilities and will make good use of both, n If Kuwait nationalists have succeeded in the realisation of part of their aspirations, it is because of their conviction that the Authority of the Nation is above the authority of the^ Government, The A m ir has been wise to accept their suggestions now. Should he have refused, other ways, note as legal as those used might have been found. The Amir's attitude has won him the admiration and fidelity ox his subjects and the respect of his neighbours, and has freed him of a heavy load. It is in his interest and that of the Principalty to establish as strong a Legislative Government as possible and to widen its field of action. 11 Thus a first step has been taken, with the results that no more uneasiness will be felt, education will improve, and the population becoming conscious of its rights will enjoy them. Tho^e who encouraged the Amir of Koweit to give his consent to the reforms wanted, have acted as his true and faithful friends. However oppressed the true spirit of a nation does not die. It sometimes accepts a temporary situation but it suddenly rises to annihilate despotism. It is possible that the Amir understood this when he acceptea. « m hpe Kuwait, will set the example to all the Principalties of the Persian Gulf. It is time they would wake up and live a real life of freedom. * The joy of the Kuwait population is our joy. We are brothers, tied by bounds of race and religion. If in the past we Imve violently attacked the Amir, it is because of our desire to see the popualtion enjoy its rights and give the principalty the place it deserves among the Arab countries, rl ’*■ i: ORIENT iVRA.BE agjsnce de presse I, RUE CENTRALE (SOLIMAN PACHA) TELEPHONE 56350 LE CAIRE o^aIa 1\ ( ) tjl ® V , ® * (j jAski /,. 4- ' AL MOSTAKBAL'' Baghdad IS.7.38 The following information appeared in several Arabic newspapers of Iraq, Syria, and -Egypt and in Baghdad's H A1 Mostakbal’ 1 , of July « The Kuweit Government is preparing for the first setting of the Kuwait Legislative Council.

In El Kadib there exists a vast building which was^used as a quarantine. When, owing to the Iranian refusal to allow ^ritish planes to fly over Iranian coasts, the air routes were altered, Bahrain was chosen as a port-of-call. The British Government ordered then the Bahrain Government to have the old quarantine repaired and the place arranged to receive flying-boats which was done. lies a district called place, ilm trees and sources belonging n About a mile south of this El Gefir, covered with gardens, pa to the Khalifa family and to Bahrain merchants. The British Govern ment proposed, through the British Councellor in Bahrain, to buy this plot of land, and meeting with refusal, took it oy force. On the spot, the British have built several buildings for military use, a sport ground, a cinema and a baal room for Aritish soldiers. On the coast a port and an aerodrome have been created. Four warships a^d four flying-boats stay there permanently. * The Bahrain Government paid for all the expenses and the British Government did not spend a piastre. The population entirely desapproves the attitude of the British Government* * This is the real story of the cration of the British Port in Bahrain. x X X w A desagreement has arisen between the Amir of Debi, Shaikh Said Ibn Maktoum and the Amir of Deira, Sheikh Maseeh. The cause of the desagreement is the claim laid by Sheikh Maneeh on some of the Debi’s income with the allegation that it used to belong to his family. Sheikh Said refused and the relations between the two principalties, which are distant one mile from each other, are very strained. * The British will certainly take advantage of the situation and make profit of fcfegxgijfeMgfciaoft it on the Oman coast. * The British representative here is of Kuwait origins.

In those times Muscat was a big State and not a small country as it is now, Muscat is divided in two parts* 1,~ the Coast, ruled by the Sultan, under England’s influence; 2,- the interior, ruled by Imam El Khalil. When Muscat fell under British protectorate, the inhabitants of Oman, the interior, elected Imam El Khalil as their ruler and made a separate State. With the exception of Oman and the Al-Hasa territory, all the Principalties of the Persian Gulf are under British authority. British penetration in the Persian Gulf started at the beginning of the 18th century, in the year 1802, after the conclusion of the first treaty with the Imam of Muscat 5 coming after the occupation of India. India was always the cause of troubles for jr&amp;b countries. Since those times, England annexed all the Principalties, the last one to submit being Kuwait in 1913. The British never interfered with the Principal ties* private affairs and were content with their acceptation of England's protection and their engagement to sign no agreement with other foreign powers. England is doing her best to prevent the penetration of any foreing influence in* the Persian Gulf. In Bahrain only, an English officer was nominated in 1923 and has since assumed the direction of the country. It is said he carries the Cheikh of Bahrain's seal and sign all the Cheikh's official documents• The different governments of the Principalties are base on ancient Arab traditions. The Amir or Cheikh is considered as head and supreme master of the State. He enjoys absolute power.He makes the Laws and sees that they are executed, he deals with all the questions and gives justice. Thus can be explained the backward situation of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, fhey remain what they were in the Middle-Ages. The English and Amirs thought it better foil their interests to leave the population uneducated and in complete ignorance. In the end however the populations understood the backward and primitive conditions they were living in and jdufcxauKaui realized the necessity of a strong effort to enjoy the light of modern life. ,Ve are pleased to see that the Principalty of Kuwait which was the last one to submit to England has also been the firfct to obtain satisfaction as to the reforms needed. The Amir of Kuwait, Ahmed El Jaber El Sabbah is to be thanked for this. A Legislative Council is now participating to the Principalty's adninistration, the members of whic have been freely elected. Hews of the Kuwait reforms were received with great satisfaction in all i.rab countries who realize now that the only way to a national existence consists in the abolishment of old systems of Government which were the cause of their submission to foreign imperialism.ORIENT A.RA.JBE AGKNCE DE PRESSE UE CENTRALE (SOLIMAN pacha) TELEPHONE 56350 LE CAIRE (Ul jU-) Jlju- \ * l r o • j yi; /e jo jM\ p~W i-'t The Debi population followed the example of Kuwait and presented their Amir with a list of revendications which we hope will soon be realized and which are in the interest of both the Amir and the population# We hope the Reformist movement will spread to ill the Principal- ties of the Persian Gulf which are still subjected to the vexatious measures of old-fashioned Governments. Their Cheifchs and Amirs are greatly responsible of the backward situation in their States, because of their submissiveness to foreign powers and of their personnal interests. It is their fault if the Arab States of the Persian Gulf are in some ways shut out of the rest of the world, submitted to foreign powers which prevent any communication with the exterior, any cooperation beteween t|ie Arab States of with other Arab Countries. Rumours had spread regarding the unification of the Principalties of the Persian Gulf. But the disagreements among the different Amirs and Cheikhs as well as Britain's policiy in those States will certain ly not allow it.

The article itself would be taken by the Arab reader, and specially by those who had real the previous articles on the subject, as a revelation of British Policy and against al-baruni Pasha, and no doubt the editor published it with this intention. The paper’s comment ' But, however it may be . it is pleasing oo us to see the Arab Amirates combined under the authority oi one man, perhaps it may lead to good in the near future , M This would mean, to an Arab reader, that although the British are engineering such a merger for their own purpose, yet we are pleased by it, since it might, in the near future, turn out to our good i.e. against the very purpose for which the British have formed it.

American inte rests were rather important in Oman. But the relations diminished after the British had imposed their protection over the coast of Oman which they named Sultanat of Muscat. The Hinterland opposed to the protection and took the arms. They succeeded in keeping their independance. This hinterland is known as the Sultanat of Oman. Its capital is Nezoui in the Jebel Akhdar and its religious leader is Imam si Khalili. H Fpr the past four years, the United States have been trying to re-establish new relations with that part of the Arab world where oil is abundant. American Companies started to compete with British Companies for the exploitation of the oil. M The mangnificent reception made to Sultan Said Ben Timur of Muscat when he visited Washington last year shows the American will of establishing close commercial relations with Oman, The Sultan was officially received by Pt. Roosevelt and was presented with many magnificent gifts, ihile he was staying in nmerica political and commercial circles approached him on the subject of relations between the two countries. In Bagdad, the American Consul shows much interest and attention to the Sultan*s brothers who are studying in Baghdad at the expense of the Iraqi Government. The Consul has offered them the use of his private car whenever they want it and offers now and then a reception for them at the American Legation. M The British Governwment watches with some alarm the American tactic. American Companies are richer* and more powerful than British companies. This is why we see many of the latter going into partnership with the .jaerican Cos for the exploitation of Arab soil.” » The Government of Muscat intends to build a carrossable road which would link Muscat with the regions of Batna, Has Kheima and Debi, This is probably the prelude of the British plan of unification of Muscat with its neighbours.

Ruggero Orlando. It is said in the article that to rule Arab countries is now a vital question to England for two reasons:” First, to protect its land, sea and air communications with India and second to guarantee to the British Government, in cae of war, or the Iraq Petroleum Cy, in time of peace, the possession of Iraqi oil. The article thhn states that England is trying to push the Arabs away from the coasts and that the plan is nearing success. The littoral of the Mediterranean, of the Red Sea, of the Aden Gulf, of the Indian Ocean and of the Persian Gulf are no more the possession of the Arabs. The latter are now trying to break the chain and attack the most vulnerable point which is Palestine. The policy Britain is believed to follow in order to ensure its supremacy is to create either union or division among the Arab countries. It seems now that England is more enclined towards bnion after all it did to destroy it. The author thihks that the Congress recently held in Cairo is a step towards the realisation of the me f ahon-Marc Sykes- Lawrence plan aiming at an Arab Union under England's protection. This question was prepared and presented at the Congress thanks to the efforts of the Iraqi Pasha Noury £1 Said and the Syrian Chahbandar both well known for their friendly relations with Proceeding, the author says that two of the main difficulties to an Arab union are about to be blotted out. l.*» i rench supremacy has much weakened in the East thanks to the f, Front Populaire Government. France is about to abandon Syria and will be content with a mere protectorate over the Lehanons and Alaouites.- 2.- Jews seem willing to abandon their vast claims in the hope to restore peace in Palestine. So England is free to follow its new policy which consists in uniting Syria and Palestine to Iraq, in pushing the Arabs away from the Sea, in taking Alexandretta from them, in putting the Lebanons and Alaouites under French protecto rate and in creating a Jewish National Home in Palestine. England believes this policy to give satisfaction to the Araos while It guarantees the British military and political as well as economical interests. « . , , .

The reasons of the dissolution of the Council are not yet known but we can be sure that the British had something to do with it. The Amir would not have taken such an important step unless he was sure of their help. The British did not like the Legislative Council and they particularly desapproved of two reforms: one tending to form students missions i^ Kuwait which would be sent to Iraqi schools the other consisting in the arrival in Kuwait of Iraki experts for administrative reorganization, Kuwait populations show a strong desire to annex their country to Iraq and the British are alarmed lest this annexion would happen, which would be very much against their interests. The British preferred to put an end to the amatter and promised their help to the Amir if he pronounced the annulment of the Council. As a preliminary step, the British Resident in Kuwait visited Baghdad some times ago and conferred with the British Consul who had previously met i. in Kuwait with the ^miir El Sabbah. British also showed their ill-will when the Amir of Debi, on the Persian Gulf was compelled by the will of his subjects to form a Legislative Council. They asked the Amir of Debi not to allow his Council the same rights as allowed to that of Kuwait. ” We must also underline the intrigues of the men of ancient regime ' who were dispossessed of their privileges and always worked against the Council.

As instructed I listened last night to this rt unknown” broadcasting Station, which is thought to be installed on a car in Syria, and report as follows. ‘The Announcer, from Ms dialect and his drawling the words such as M Far ansa”, appears to me to be a Syrian and not an Iraqi or any other national. In his talk, after opening the station, he bitterly attacked the French authorities, Colonization and the Mandate, and later he blamed Abdur-Rahman Shahbender, the Syrian Leader, and entreated him and his colleague a to leave discussions aside, and to take/firmer attitude for the welfare of the Country. After that he implored the Syrian Nationals to rise collectively for the independence and freedom of their country, Syria. He spoke about the spies, who have been trying every means to locate his station, and said that he will continue broadcasting from the station. Before finishing his talk he called the Heads 01 different Syrian Parties for a meeting to be held at that station at 11.30 (their time) last evening. He, many times, repeated these words, ;? Party of Great Syria calling you”. At the end he gave orders and instructions to Biany Divisional parties, by their numbers, in the following places♦ Aleppo Beirut Homs Tripoli about distributing the arms and money in their possession. He said that he would continue broadcasting from the station every evening from 8.15 (local time 9.15}.ORIENT ARAIBIE agence de presse 39 , RUE SOLI MAN PAC^A TELEPHONE 5635 le caire ^ ' AL CHASAB' ( Cairo) 7.2.39.- hr i 'jWJ&amp;w 23 S i ytUll _ U.I jU- r&lt;\ e 1 r 0 * jyi; The following information appeared in the ”Al Chabab” of Cairo in its issue of February 7th 8 ” We are informed from Bahrain of the develop©- ment of the nationalist strife against foreign colo nization* The British Officer punishes the nationalists with the utmost severity.

It was an easy thing to see for those who know both States• Political reasons have driven the Saudi Govern ment to boycott Kuwait goods. The boycott lasted 15 years although the populations of the two countries felts its great disadvantages. In such conditions, smuggling became a regular trade and many a smuggler made a considerable fortune that way. During these 15 years, the Saudi Government made the greatest efforts to stop their doings. The roads linking the two states were closely watched and the smugglers caught red-handed severly punished. w ^hen a Legislative Assembly was formed in Kuwait the Government felt it t&amp;eir first duty to resume their good relations with the Saudi Government. It is painful to admit that the latter did not seem to appreciate the goodwill of the Kuwait Assembly. The negotiations utterly failed. /e hear from well informed cercles that the main reason for this failure is that the customs tariff and the price of goods is very much out of peeping. For instance in Saudi Arabia the duty for one sack of sugar is equal to that of $0 sacks in Kuwait, tfhy does not the Saudi Govern ment lessen the burden of their subjects ? 5 We humbly address His majesty King Ibn 3 aud who is kind and righteous and hope that he will not be prevented from reading our plea. ■8 (i ){ 58{ ,, L’ORIENT ARABE agencb de presse 39, RUE SOLIMAN PACHA TELEPHONE 56350 LE CAIRE d '...

It was entitled: M Bahrain under the British whip” H The situation is getting worse and worse in Bahrain. The British authorities are taking a very severe attitude towards the population. The mail, telegrams and telephone calls are censured. Any newspaper daring to comment on the situation is forbidden in the Islands which an evil fate has placed under British rule. As to the Amir, he is not allowed to take a single move withput the British councellor's permission. The latter is showing the utmost severity in the trial of the nationalists and political prisonners. He seems anxious to equal in cruelty his Palestine colleagues. Lately, one of the political prisoner died at the Citadel as a consequence of the violences of the police. But the Britishers may well be as tyrannic as they want the nationalists will nevertheless fight to the end for the realization of their rightful claims. It is really regrattable that an Arab from Bahrain should help the Britishers in their assassination of the spitit of freedom and that he should take advantage of his position as Director of Education to propagate anti-national ideas among the students. He is also responsible for the backwardness of Education in Bahrain and is generally knwon as a spy. n;&gt; SiAOjj I L’ ORIENT A.RARE agbnce de presse 39, RUE SOLI MAN PACHA TELEPHONE 56350 LE CAIRE ^aU !1 _ li-l f\ m r o ♦ jyi; ^ ^ Beirut. 1.2.39.- 0r/e ^e-, /&amp; The following article by a correspondent in Basrah appeared in the M A1 Nahar' of Beirut in its issue of February 1st 1938. w As a result of the carelessness shown by the Arab Amirs of the Persian Gulf as regards the internal government of their states and the needs of the population, the foreigners have taken a prominent position in the Arab States, namely Kuwait and Bahrain. This foreign prominence is a great danger for Arab nationalism and the national life of the States. The Arabs have not yet for gotten the attempts made a few years ago by a foreign power to appropriate to itself the Bahrain Islands under the pretence that they belonged formerly to her. It succeeded however in taking part of the country. An Interesting fact is that the foreign power does not ask for a consular visa to travel to Bahrain and Kuwait, thus implying that the two States already belong to her. It is time to watch closely, before the Alexandret- ta drama repeats itself.” N.B* The author of the above article does not name the foreign power he refers to.
