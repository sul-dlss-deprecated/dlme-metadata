My dear Stewart, I am sorry for not answering your letter of the 17th January, regarding the services of the various Consuls at Aden sooner, but the matter has required rather careful examination* I am afraid there are serious difficulties in the way of accepting your recommendations in this matter. In the first place, there are practically no precedents for the grant of Indian Titles to members of Foreign Consular stafis. Ic is true that the Persian Consul General was made a n.C.k.G. at tne time of the King f s Durbar, but I can find no instance of the Star of India or the Indian limp ire having been conferred on any Foreign Consul. In the second place, there might be international objec tions to the proposal to grant a title to Dr* Oe^chi, Pie Icalian Consul at Aden, at the present time. It must be remembered that Italian ambitions have been, and are, now directed towards the Bed Sea and the Arabian coast, and that if we marked out the Italian Consul at Aden for a signal distinction this might excite the suspicion of the Italian Government and possibly injure rather than benefit Dr. Ce&amp;eliis position in the eyes Ox mis own Government. Again, as regards the French Consul, monsieur Adolphe hies, we feel that it might be invidious to decorate him when we have not yet decorated the Governor General of the French Indies ox tue Administrator of Chandernagore, both of whom have afforded us valuable co-operation of late. Indeed, His Excellency the Viceroy thinks that the whole question of rewarding Foreign Consuls in any concrete fashion must stand over till the end of the war. In the mean time, however, if 1 y ou think that it would he a good thing that the services of the gentlemen you mention should he officially recognised hy the Government of India and an expression of their appreciation he conveyed, will you please send me d brief official letter suggesting this I can then send you an official letter in reply expressingexpressing’ tlie desired appreciation* You might then informally give copies of this official correspondence to the gentlemen in question* Yours sincerely, 3d.

About that time t my daughter and .1 had to leave KODiilDAM temporarily owing to the sudden serious develop- .nr. nt in the ooiitical situation at the Turkish capital. ,e remained in ADo&gt;i; till the third week in October,and seeing that there was no improvement in the existing statA of affairs,but on the contrary,that the Turks were being steadily dragged by Germany into the war against the Triple Anter:te,the question naturally arose of quitting our Arabian home until matters assumed their normal turn once more. ith this object in ffiittCanA in order to pack up my household goods,we returned to Hodeid&amp;h prior to talcing our departure from there indefinitely. e were hardly ready to leave,when news reached us of bhe imminence of war with Turkey. Instructions were simultaneously transmitted from the embassy at Constantinople to our Consulate to clear all British shipping from ports in the district,but that ray hue band was to remain at his post till further orders. There were no vessels in Yemen waters at the tine, but it was presumed that one of his &lt;aj esty ’ s ships would be despatched on the actual outbreak of hostili ties to convey us and other British sufcjGets.away from ilOAiiilDAil. iifhen that contingency arose,we found to our intense disappointment that no warship was forthcoming to place is in safety. I could not help thinking that the authori ties concerned had,at t ic critical time,quite lor^otten the existence at Uodeidah of a faithful servant of thef&gt; — —_ Crown who had given the test years of his life to Kin His majesty*8 Government at an isolated and outlying duar wer ot tr e Ottoman dominions — a service , tiay 1 He permitted to remar ic # rendered cheerfully, yith ability and P&amp;tiencc,conscientiously and unostentatiously,under the lost trying conditions. An urgent request to the hritish fiesidentjat AHEM for a vessel to taice us away,even failed to elicit any result and were left to the tender mercies of the Yemen authori ties ,who,ever ranee the beginning of the struggle raging in Hurope,had been wording up an anti-British and hostile attitude. Cn the other hand,on the 4th or November in the afteiw noon,we experienced an unpleasant surprise in the visit of lafO* 4 ,which,after crew tin ~ a sensation in the town oy setting fire to an oral dhow in the port,steamed unconcernedly away,as if unaware of the presence on shore, and indifferent to the safety of,the British Consular -eprecentative and a few hundreds of British subjects. As the Turics had had no official intimation of the declaration of war,it was hoped to have ueen able to Keep tnem in ignorance of that fact until such time as a ship as available to carry as away from UC-IhAJl,but this was now out of the question. In reply to the energetic protest of the local authorities a a ins t the hostile act con mi tied by ii. .:.r&gt;. ,, lhTG M t my husband finding it difficult to suppress any longer the fact that diplomatic relations between England and Turkey had been broK€?n off, thought fit now to apply for his passports. As anticipated,the authorities immediately tooK reprisals for the aggressive action of lull's Chip by imposing rigorous measures against my husband personally, who was practically a prisoner from the afternoon of the her visit to the port.± mmm A Btrong guard was posted round the Consulate in order to prevent communication with outsiders. Our servants were molested fcy gendarmes when leaving or entering the house.and after a few days,even the Fro- Consul dragoman and other employees vere for Li dden to come near the Consulate. ^iiese restrictions culminated in ly husDand ,daufh4er and my gel fjoeing forcibly prevented on the 7 th November from -oing to the Italian Consulate next door, .here we had been invited for lunch. •*ot many days later, we were outfitted to lurther annoj ances in the form of threatening demonstr&amp;tione dail; before our Consulate door,by armed bedouins from the interior.assisted by the worst characters in the town. This was,at the instigation of the local covernor.HAGhl^ B£Y. On the 5th November,an Italian steamer bound for A called at hodeidah. The Vali of the Yemen refused to allow my husband to leave,on the i re text that he had nreviousiy received orders to detain *.**«**€- Consuls of lowers that, should be involved in war against TUHIQSY. Per.tiission,hovfev&lt;r, r as readily accorded to :y daughter and to me to quit,as it appeared that the author!* ties were most anxious to get us out of the way. hi1e sending my daughter away in order that she rdght acquaint the Aden Residency with the state of affairs at HQDhlDAH,1 decided to remain behind to watch the proceedings with regard to y husband,towards whom 1 suspected nefarious designs on the part of the Turks. The Governor.thinking I was about to depart,called on us on the 9 th. I remonstrated with him on the subject of the treat- ment being accorded to my husband ,'«wd while not axinga secret ol hie intentions in future,^e endeavoured to evade responeibillty for hin actions by oayinjr- that he was acting under orders of the Governor-General at LkltA'k. It was always my :reat.dread that U&gt;e Turks would remove ny husband somewhere inland to preclude his possible release by a British ship of war, I was therefore undecJijQved when after midnight on the 11/12 November»we were roused by the noise of sev eral Turkish officers and numerous armed gendarmes attempt ing to grin access forcibly to the Consulate in search of my husband. fttr earnert e i treaties ,I prevailed on hi r: to proceed next door and seek refuge in the Italian Consulate General. 1 then went downstairs to interview the midnight invaders who were led by a certain GADXs* ICTY, the Commissary of Police. The letter-mentioned official gained entrance under the pretext of having been deputed to personally hand over a most urgent telegram to ay husband from the Veil, but I forbad the other officers waitin'- on the stairs to enter and barred t eir progress with my arms stretched aeroas the doorway. 3A3i % BHY seemed to be nervous about going upstairs alone in search of my husband, -robably fearing attack, so he forced me to accompany him. As soon as we had ascended to the next storey,all the other officers and gendarmes poured into the house and scattered themselves about. After wandering about the house futilly.the Commissary of Police came up to me and shaking re roughly, demanded in an angry tone where my husband was. I replied that he should look for him if he wanted him. On learning from one of the other officers that- r. it i chard bo n Had cEcaped to t ne I tai ian Uono ilate, BSY slapped hie head in despair and invoiced all sorts or ourne 3 on me. Ihe circumstances of the attacK on the Italian Consulate and his ultimte arrest therein oy the lurks have already fceen described in detail in my husband* 8 report. All I heard and witnessed after the chief of ; olios had left me,were tne tramping of a company of Curieish soldiers in the direction of the Italian Consulate about a quarter of an hour Ifterwards,and the dragging of a gun by some men. This gun,I observ ed, was conveyed on mules and was placed in the street just under ay bedroom window. The euboequent firing of a volley outside the Italian Consulate,1ollowed by a discharge of riliea and revolvers and. the screams of women inside that building me, terrified ne ana Xed^ tc^suppose that either my husband or r. Consul CCOCHI had been Killed. After what appeared to me to have been several hours,I was greatly relieved to see y husband return ing to his Consulate,where after dressing himself .pnnied the Uf in- officers who had brought there. The Commissary of I'olice assured ie th&amp;t .. r. iichnrdson would fc-e allowed, to return in half an hour, out 1 saw no more 02 him till his liberation three raon tho nt t • r war ds. Tne following afternoon,the hovernor in company of the TurKioh Commodore called at the Consulate and informed me that my husband ?;ould be sent up to bAT.A*A. 1 remonstrated with these officials at the in human treatment being received by my husband. \ AC it IA K , tne Cover nor, complained that r. hichardoon was the cause of the unpleasant incidentat tiie Italian Consulate the night previous, but he was sta^^ered ana not a little annoyed when 1 told hi:n that I had begged my husband to seeK asylui-i next door. Ihe Governor tried to impress on me that he was in a positional) adopt even severer measures against my hue band,11 necessary. i have forgotten to mention that on hie first visit to me,I ini'erred. from GAGHIB B&gt;iY that the princip at grievance of the local authorities against ?ny husband was on account or of the oificial publication in the vernacular by the Consulate and ciistribution throughout the vilayet of news and literature pertain ing to the war. This,it would appear,referred to the circulation generally of the official news of the war received from iU^.Embassy;also to the translation into Arabic and other languages of two speeches made by the Trime Mn- ioter and Cir ^dward 'Jrey respectively oii the causes of the war with Germany. In reply,I pointed oat to the Governor that tne publications to vhicn ht tooK exception had no o€?aring on affairs in the TurKish nrapire ,nna were me.de under the instructions of U.c. -ri Ush Government. After the arrest and deportation of my husband,! was practically oloo a prisoner in the Consulate,and no communication was allowed * ith me. Cav.C.vCCi.l,however,was no re so n nriaoner.and was coniinea to his quarters under orders of the local mutesaarif. A strong guard was place all round the Italian Consulate.which no one was allowed to enter. he and I were able to hold &amp; conversation occasion ally troi. windows in close proximity in our respective Consulates which were adjoining,and were thus in a position to commiserate with each other.The authorities used to annoy Oav.CnCOKl in every possible wayjand. to try to increase iiis isery and anx iety by sett'ii -■£ i •&lt;i-v imrcrtinent aeKsa/^es , so. tne eflect tiiat ne would be tried by Court-nartial and snot lor tiring on Turkish troops.and at otner times, .. imprisonment tnat fte would be sentenced to a term of in a fortress. I used to endeavour to console him by assuring him tnat the Italian Government would not delay in despatch- ing a ship of war to briar about his release. About trie last wee* in hove ter,an Italian steamer called at hodeidah en route to ' AhSA^A. Ihe Agent of the Company,after being sub itted to a strict bodily search to see that be had no papers on his person,was permitted to go on board, /hence he con trived to send information to the authorities in regarding the arrest and imorison, ent of their Consul. Cn the 3rd December,being the day appointed lor the trial 01 Cav• ChCCiil,the armrd Italian Yacht ”aHa M G'J lLlAhA“ appeared oil the roadstead. On my aavice,ne (Oav.CilCCHl) hoisted his Consular flag over his residence,wnicn ne had been forbidden to no since the date of hie detention. An hour later an officer landed from the Italian Gun- Aoat and after a short interview with the Governor, called at the Italian consulate. He than returned taking r.I dCHI with him. Once on board,the Italian Consul refused to return to his Consulate , nending the receipt of lull reparation fro. the C Itoman Government lor its violation,/// and his arbitrary detention as a prisoner ,by the iiodeidah authorities.

It v/as at first feared that the foreign invaders were English and a Turkish force was despatched to oppose their landing,but the officer in command was much relieved on ascertaining through an arab * pari ementa ire 1 that the strangers were tier many and not hngliah. The Germans were cordially greeted by the troops but an even warmer welcome awaited their arrival at hodeidah. It would appear from information furnished by the German on leers themselves that they had set out from GUhAThA and reached AC CAY* A in a small vessel. They then made for the HAKIsiSH XiiLAADS in the HKD SJiA,whence they crossed over in boats to the Yemen Coast. The officers and men seemed to be in n very fitcondition.and brought with them four nitrailleusee On the Kaiser’s birthday, tne 2'/th or January, which strange to say coincided with the annivei'sary or that or the Prophet I^.thc Uennans proceeded, to UAIiA’A where.they joined the Turkish forces in the vilayet. About the 7tii of January or shortly afterward©, orders were transmitted through the vilayet dismissing AAGHIh ikshf, the Governor of UOi^XDAH .Ghhl^ ^hY.the Chief of Police and an instrument ol oppression 01 the local AutessariflicK,aloo the Ooramandant and an officer of the Genaarraery. it might be recalled that these officials were principally concerned in the violation of the British and Italian Consulates already referred to in this wefiei and in the arrest or my nusband on the night or the 11/12 i-overuber , 1V14. Their dismissal had been demanded by the Italian Government .and Ithough orders on the subject had reached the Vali some little time previo 1 oly,they were now most reluctantly and tardily executed .and this , only under pressure of the Italian Cruiser deahatched to Hodcidah to ensure that full satisfaction was given to Cav.CivCCUI for the outrage committed on him and the Italian Consulate. however,tne removal ol these officials was nailed with intense satisfaction by natives and huropean© aliice and a feeling ol relief and security once ore pervaded the city. The exit ol the notorious oflicicls mentioned above .who were called up to UAhA*A,was the signal lor the return to the town of thounande of the inhabitants Quantity of provisions and other store©. who had lied to the villages In the interior duringthe 10nth of November .especially irony influential arab and Indian merchants. On the 29 tn January,Lt.-CoX.RAOHIE BiiY.the military uonmander oil tne ilodeidah division paid rae a visit. 1 enquired of whom when my husband was liKely to or ‘ released, he replied sharply 'not till the end of the war '. Having already learnt that the Italians had success iully pressed their demands on the TurKish Oovernment , I pointed to the Italian Cruiser V.ARCO POLO M that had arrived in port a iew hours previously,and asked him what her coming meant. Ool.HAGrKIB BUY did not like my question and tried to put me off replying that Oav.CKCCHI not being satisfied with the small Cun Boat on which he was living had applied to his Government for a Cruiser. There is nothing further of interest to chronicle but I would venture to observe that it was very strange that the 'S party succeeded in landing near HOBBIBAH under the eyes of the krench Cruiser 'nCGAUX' that had been lying off the Kodeidah roadstead i or a month at that ti ie. The crew related the fact or having seen the above- mentioned cruiser whilst they were disembarking. About a week prior to my departure from H0DB1BAH the city had resumed its normal state of pence and quiet under the administration of the newly-appointed Acting Governor,ABDUL HA^ KAK&amp;I BBY. This state of trnnquility was only momentarily on the 6th February disturbed by the arrival of the British Auxiliary CruiseBe of iaiGSIA N and 'BCPBBhS of ASIA”. The Irench Cruiser n DB3AUX w and the Italian ”, AH CO POLO 1 * were also anchored at HGDEIDAH. It was feared locally that this concentration offour ships of war meant that naval action aminot KOIX/'.IDAK was contemplated in the event ot any lurther obstruction on the part of the Yemen Administration in tne settlement of their 'incident* *dth the Italians. V.y husband arrived the same morning from DAK A* A and proceeded direct to the Italian Consulate where he remained till the completion of the formalities in connection with the tendering oi the apoloriee oi the Ottoman Government to CAV.CDCCKI through the local authoritie». three hours later,alter lunching at the Italian Consulate where a party of ofiicere from the *:AHCO POhO* 1 who had landed to attend tne ceremony that morn* ing were invited to meet us,we were put on board . 4 • .

Dir:- As telegraphed tnie morning, I Dave the honour to report my arrival here i’rom HODEXD/hi on the 7th instant, in lih .rih, .“KUiidbn OF An 1 a' 1 further avail myself of this opportunity to report in detail the circumstances of t y cietentioii by the authorities in the YEIlEh after the declaration of hostilities vdth TURKEY, of my arrest at MODEIDAH and deportation thence, of my imprisortaent at B/kiilL and subsequent removal to a, and of my liberation ultimately on the 6th instant. On the 3rd hovember last, 1 received a telegram in cypher from H.l • .-mbas^idor at Constantinople which was dated the 30th October 1914, infonaing me that war had been declared with TURKEY and instructing me to demand The Right ^onour mle, uir Edwarc rey, Bart., K.C., 1 m . c’ C • , c ,C . , c: C . ,demand my passports. 1 immediately Galled on my French colleague, whom X found had received similar information and instructions from his Embassy. In view of the precautions that had been taken by the British authorities at PKK1M to prevent news of the political situation reaching the lurks in the iemen, we vvare both sure that the local authorities had not as yet received official intimation of the declaration of war, and that they were unlikely to get same for some time. There were, at the time, no ships in poro, bul an Italian steamer bound for ADEN was expected on the 7th l.ovember. I, y French colleague and I accordingly agreed that in the meantime, whilst making all necessary prepara tions for our departure and arrangements for tne protection in our absence of the interests of our respective countries, it was advisable to suppress the news of the outbreak of hostilities till a snip was available to take us away. BeingBeing intimately acquainted with the character of the Ottoman officials one has to deal with in the vilayet of Yemen, 1 had from the outset, had some misgivings about being permitted to leave lurKish terriuocy• However, 1 was in hopes that one of Bi^ i ajesty s chins would be despatched to Hodeidah to secure the departure of my french colleague and myself, as also to get away British ami French subjects who were desirous of leaving. I evertheless, I telegraphed to the i'Oiiiivml Resident at aDEN asking Mra to send me a ship, out unfortunately received neither reply nor result. on the afternoon of the 4th November, while the local Governor w.is at the Consulate on a visit to me in connection with the settlement of an outstanding British claim, the arrival in port of a el ip of war flying the Ottoman flag, was reported to oix.. Shortly afterwards, it was observed that tiie vessel had substituted the 'white ensign' for the furKishTurkish flag, and had lowered i steam cutter; further that the latter had approached and set fire to an Oouo- mandhow laden with cargo, that was lying at anchor in the roadstead, after having previously sent her crew on shore. This act of the British ship, now known to have Been H.KS.^hXhTO 11 (fornerly of the Royal Indian tarine) which had teen witnessed by the authorities and a vast concourse of the townspeople who had gathered all along the foreshore, caused great consternation locally, and gave rise to a terrible panic. His Majesty * s ship proceeded northwards, shortly after sunset. The first effect of this hostile act on the part of H.h.h.^vlhT ) H was to cause the authorities who must now have suspected that war between England and TURKEY had broken out to ii i iediately post a strong guard of gendarmes and police all round my Consulate, partly to preclude any chances of my escape, and partly to prevent communicalion with outsiders. TheThe same evening, the kutesarrif addressed a , ote of Protest to the resident foreign Consuls against the act of aggression committed by His iajesty's ship, contending that such was perpetrated prior to the declaration of war. Before receiving this note, 1 thought fit to apply to the authorities for my passports, and acting under the instructions sent me, 1 notified that the American Consular Agency at HODEIDAH would be in enarge oi British interests after my departure. The reply received to rny note being most evasive, I telegraphed on the 6th hovamber to the ViiLI at Bit.A' requesting His Excellency to cause my departure from Hodelda to he facilitated and also uo instrucu the Hodeldah authorities to recognise ray American colleague as being in charge of the protection of British subjects and interests in the Yemen. Later the same day, I learnt from a telegram from the Cove smor-General, HKDLM BEY that some time previously orders had been received at the vilayet fromfrom the Central Government to the effect, that In the event of hostilities between turkey and any other power, the Consular representative of the latter snoulu not be allowed to quit without reference to Constanti nople . Such reference, His Excellency pointed out, was not possible, now, owing to the cutting on completely vt. of telegraphic communication between PERI! &gt; and the YE. El.. Thereafter, the measures adopted against me were being made more rigid daily. Eirst the members of my staff were forbidden to visit the consulate; then y servants were continually molested by the police, and lastly some of the latter were imprisoned. i remonstrated with the Governor through my Dragoman at the unnecessary interference and at the blockade imposed against my Consulate, and enquired whether I was to consider myself a prisoner. ho satisfactory reply could be elicited but 1 was informed in a vague manner that the gendarmes aroundaround the Consulate were for my protection against the violence of the local arabs who were incensed at the outrage committed by His Majesty's ship on the 4th ho vender 1 ihe same day, I was invitee to lunch at the Italian Consulate which is just next door to my consulate, out my wife, daughter and 1 were stopped on our way thither, roughly handled by Turkish gendarmes and compelled to return. Thereafter, my dragoman was forbidden to see me, cation through the latter, that the designs of tne local authorities were far from friendly and that 1 should take the necessary precautions. and my servants were even prevented from going uUt to the market to buy provisions. almost daily 1 was warned by my Italian Colleague and other friends who managed to send me secret eom uni in the city, was being rumoured very freely. This compelled me to remain at home with my family with closed uoors, and to take steps oo s-arii cadecade all ingress to i'ny Consulate, Provisions wera procured for us throuj-0 the Kind- neBS of the Italian Consul aiiu orc passed trow his residence into nine ever our respective terraces that were joined.

On the 7th hovember, the Italian steamer H CaPRI’ 1 called at our port, but the strictest precautions were taken against all courunication witn hex lion Ine shore, fee Italian Consul and fee agent o£ the vessel alone being allowed to board orr. nobody was perrrdtted to mhark out ultimately, permission was accorded to my wife and daurhter md. to two missionary ladies to leave toy the vessel. vt fee last moment, my wife bravely uecideu to remain behind, in order to natch what would happen to me, to await developments locally and in y absence70 absence to report the ettnatton, it poesibie, to hie l a j esty 1 s Govenwient • I sent a short message b^/ my ciaughtar who travelled to ADEN in the to the ^ierican Consul here requesting him to inform his Embassy at Constantinople about my detention at Kodoidah* 1 also iixs true ted njy daurffiter to report to tne author!tics au ADEh tnat British subjects and 1 were in danger. Ihe l-.utusaarif called on rue in the afternoon on the 9th November, and in reply to ray protests at Due treatment that was being accorded me, stated that while no ro ^rited the measures taken, they were la coniorru.ity ViiUi orders received from BaEA’a. his nxcullency added that it was not possible to carry out to tne letter all the instructions received, as they were contrary to the laws of hiran’ty, This information naturally pat me stall lurtncu on my truard and caunea me to redouble m precautions against a surprise. t;qi the loth Eovmaber, news reached Bodeidali ux the bonbardment of the iurklsh fort at hhiiXK SAID vi BriuishBritish ships ol war ana ol the suDseqaent clebarcation of troops there. This instilled a sense of great fear into the authorities and the townsfolk. The same night, there was a tig exodus of the population from RODEIBAH into the interior, as it was expected that the British warships would pay the port a visit on the i sorrow. On the night of the 11/12 no vernier, at about a half past twelve 1 was awakened by a noise in my house On inquiry, my servants informed me that some Turkish officers -and several armed soldiers, aier threatening the doorkeeper, had forced themselves into the Consulate in search of me. At the suggestion of my wife who feared that the ou ject of this mionight visit might be to assassinate me immediately passea from my terrace over a low wall on to that of the adjoining Italian Consulate- General and thence into the consulate itself. I roused the Acting Consul-General, Cav. CECChl, informeda*-—-infoniied him of the facts of the case mu asked for asylum. this was most readily and cordially ^Iven re, and 1 was accommodated in the Consul’s bedroom. The ’Corn dssaire of Police* who was at the head of the nocturnal raiders, on discovering that I had escaped, vented his rage by insulting and roughly handling my wife. About half an hour later, the local Cominunuant of Gendarmes, i ajar Kflh BKY, accoiiipanieu b^ other officers and a body of armed men proceeded next door to the Italian Consulate. although the Italian Consul-General only consented to admit and receive the former mentioned officer, the Oommissaire of Police and a nui her of genuaniies forcibly pushed their way past the door-keeper of the Italian Consulate, in spite of the protests of one Consul and of his Cavasses. . ajor hi Ih BEY, on the authority of the i utesarrif called for my peremptory surrender to him, but Civ. CECGKI replied that h,e was unable to do so in the manner demanded. While admitting, tnrou. a dr i.,:;oi:.:Ui, thatthat he could not cot .pel ne u&gt; quit his Consul ate where 1 had sought Italian pretection, he would subordinate luture action to such instructions as ne mi pit receive from his Government. On the Conmanaant of the force and the other officers present swearing on the Koran ana solemnly assuring me that no harm would come to me if 1 surrendered myself V I came out of the room md gave myself up. It was now about a half past two in the morning. 1 was then conducted by five officers and fifteen soldiers to a garden called ’The MALI 1 which is situated a few miles outside the city and confines in a small house therein. . gate the same afternoon, 1 discovereo. tnut ...y who had been arrested a few hours i'rench colleague after nys e1f was to. also interned in the garden referred „.o communication was permitted with my Consulate where 1 had left my wife in a terrified conditior in the early hours of that eventful v-ovnia INCue (the ^roiich Uonsul anti. 1} wore kept the whole of that day without a scrap of foou. that evening at about 9 o*clock, \&lt;e were informed by the uai-raakam of htWAL who called on us, that he had orders to rer ove us to EhJaL, a village on the s A f b road and sorrie 2b tales fror&gt;» the coast, althougli 1 protested at being called upon to tove %m ■ tely, pointing out that 3. was very tired and had been without food for over twenty-four hours, we were compelled to leave arid to ride all night for twenty- five miles, with only a halt for two hours on route to rest ourselves and our animals. ,e arrived at B/kJ/iL on the following taoniing at B o'clock and were taken to the G&amp;iramakam*s oiilce . Later t we were confined in a small rooui in the 'haKUi-.-a (GoverrHiient Place).

Our Quarters were filthy dirty anu there was barelybarely roorii to rnove about inside. ibe fuiiiiture consisted oi two string beds (arab) two chairs and a broken-down table. Besides the sentries stationed day and night all round the building in which we were confined, and at the two main doors giving access to it, a couple of armed gendarmes with ’fixed bayonets’ were posted immediately outside the door of our room to watch us and prevent communication with outsiders. on the third day after our arrival, we were told that we should have to provide ourselves with food ;ur 1 ng our h ftpri sonric 11 o. Having been arrested and taken away suddenly Lrom my Consulate at night, 1 was without money anu only had the suit of clothes 1 stoou in.

Although an old employee of the Government, he was not trusted. He was searched, and sometimes even stripped before allowed to enter our chamber. Our food was, at the same time, inspected and often handled by filthily clothed gendarmes to ascertain whether any letters etc. were concealed amongst the dishes. V &lt;e were submitted to the further humiliation of being escorted by a gendarme with a loaded rifle and bayonet fixed, whenever we had occasion to go for a wash to the o-called lavatory - a wretched and xoul- smelling dungeon situated in the main building and only about a dozen paces away from our cell. The village of BhJaL, at the time of our muni ment there was full of sickness, and was moreover infected with small-pox and malaria. fne latter facts were not unknown to the Governor of HODEIDAH. and it was not secretly suggested to me that we were sent there in the hopes of catching and succumbing to 1 j The e i t/h e r o i 1 j] i e s e di b e is e s •The French Consul, I might mention, was ill more or less the whole time we were at BAJAL, and 1 also was laid up twice, suffering from malarial fever.

Our letters did not reach their destination very often. On one occasion, the contents of a telegram despatched by me to my wife to inform her of my illness wereZ!) were cieliberat/ely changed, and it, v/as inade to appeal to her that I v/ae well and comfortable at On the 24th December, 1^14, the Oaimmakam infoii^ed us that the ViiLX had invited us up to Bah A* A, as ne had heard that we had been keeping indifferent health in BAJAL • .,0 replied that we had no aesire to go to a, whereupon we were told that we would he sent thither by force if we refused to go. 1 have since learnt that the authorities about this time received orders from the ruKi'E to oeliver tions by sending us further in. inland and about 150 miles from the Coast so that it would be difficult to get at us. Caiunakam-Oaiminakam and twenty mounted gendarmes. readied our destination on the 1st of January and were lodged in two separate houses. During our detention of one i onth at the capital, we were provided, with the necessaries of life and had a certain amount of liberty. although some ten gendarmes were posted at the gate of rny house, 1 was allowed to go out when 1 liked, accompanied by a Turkish official who was deputed to reside in the same house with me. Though ostensibly for my protection, the real object of placing so strong a guard at my quarters was no prevent intercourse with arab sheiks with whom X was friendly, as it was feared that an attempt might be made to release me. The Vali called to see me the day after our arrival. He expressed regret for the treatment meted out to me in liODEIDMI and at BnJ/iL respectively. I informed His Excellency that 1 had been given to understand clearly that such unnecessarily crueland iiihuiiiane treatment was the result of orders issued by him to his subordinates at those places. This, he emphatically denied, but endeavoured to throw the whole responsibility on HAGRIB BEY, the then lutesarrif of Hodeidah and on the Gaimmakam of BAJAL. His Excellency also disclaimed all responsibility for the midnight attack on me in my Consulate at Hodeidah and for the violation of the Italian Consulate General. lie added that he even had no knowledge of our having been removed by night to BAJAL and that he was only informed of that fact on the day following our arrival there \ While it is possible that HAGHIB BEY, the mutesarrif, (since dismissed) who is a rabid young in ny ii .... ***&amp;» Turk, lairdit have exceeded his instructions and was ill-advised by the pro-German military party in HODEIDAH, 1 think that it is highly improbable that he could have acted solely on his own initiative but j ust have got his orders from the Governor-General.

On one occasion His Excellency communicated both to rny French colleague and to me the contents of a telegram received from the minister of the Interior, from which it would be inferred that our detention in the Yemen was primarily due to a sii &lt;ilar detention by the French authorities in France of Frince 0, W T00HB1N Pasha and a certain alYUB 8ABRI BEY 1 l X have no complaint whatever to make about my treatment in BAH A* A.

Owing uo our long-standing aquaint.- ance and friendship, I was able to obtain some most useful information during niy visits.His Excellency often gave me such news of the war as he was in possession of (not the official furftish version) It was not long after our irrival at SAHA*A that we privately learnt from certain officials at the vilayet that orders had been received to permit us to leave the Yemen, but that the Vali was most reluctant to execute such. It would appear that about the middle of last month a telegram in cypher arrived from the Minister of the interior through the Italian station at i.-ASSawA, confirming previous orders transmitted t amongst others, Ko&amp;eidah. The text of this cypher telegram was secretly communicated to n*y French colleague. this private Secretary at the vilayet who dis imparted to onsieur HOUX, an account of that uis It would be inferred that the VALI was extremely one being to hand me back to the Italian Consulate at cussed the execution of the Forte’s instructions, above referred to, with the Vali himself, confidentiaH; cusslon. averseaverse U) my surrender to the Italian Consulate and x '**» K * i *.«*r ultimate release and was determined not to carry out the iorte's orders. uhen it was suggested to His Excellency by the Secretary that refusal to grant satisfaction to ITALY for violation of and the attack on their Consulate at Hodeidah and for the subsequent detention for three weeks as a prisoner of their representative, as IaLaaX BEY had not failed to clearly point out In his tele gram, would entail war with that country as a con sequence, he (the Vali; replied that war with ITALY was preferable to British aggressive action against the Yemen, which would most certainly follow my liberation and departure from HODEIDAH I l After this, some correspondence ensued between the vilayet and the Italian Consul and the Commander of the Cruiser 'MARCO POLO' then lying off the Hodeidah roadstead culminating in the despatch by the latter vessel of an ultimatum to the SAhA*A authorities Ltrance to say, we were made acquainted through the kindness of sympathetic friends in the covernment serviceservice who had access to the confidential archives, with the purport of the correspondence referred to above.

The first, very bare notice of the incident, reached assorwa by the 3.3. 'Porto di All essandretta' . According to a fuller report if£ is confirmed that a body of Turkish gendarmes surrounded the Italian Consulate firing rifle and revolver shots. An Italian cavass was wounded, the British Consul was seized and the same night interned together with his French colleague who The Right Honourable 3ir 3.

Active conversations are, Baron Sonnino said, proceeding at Constantinople where the Italian Am bassador is demanding the liberation of the British Consul and the punishment of the persons responsible for the attack on the Italian Consulate at Hodeidah. Communications between Hodeidah and Constanti nople were difficult as the only cable connecting the two •be Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P., &amp;c,, &amp;c., &amp;c.two cities passes through Perirn; and the Italian Gov ernment have consequently expressed their readiness to convey to the Governor of the Yemen any cormnunications despatched to him hy the Sublime Porte. .the Ottoman Government accordingly despatched in this raanner telegrams giving instructions to the Governor of the Yemen to send the British Consul back to the Italian Consulate forthwith, to furnish a report on the incident and to dismiss and bring to justice the promoters thereof. In the meanwhile at Hodeidah itself the Italian Consul and the Commander of the Steamship 'Glullana' have taken action which has led to the liberation of the wounded Italian'cavass. Baron Sonnino therefore considered that there was every reason to believe that this regrettable incident would be satisfactorily disposed of in view of the good will displayed by the Government at Constantinople. His Excellency was also able to inform the Senate of the satisfactory solution of another matter.± On the 12th, instant the Italian Consul at Beirut had reported that the Ottoman authorities had received instructions to prevent all foreigners, including even Consular Officers of neutral Powers, from leaving the country. In reply to an immediate protest made at Con stantinople, Baron Sonnino had now heard that the Ottoman Government had revoked these instructions and that Italian subjects would he allowed to leave Beirut at their will; Italian vessels would be per mitted to continue their usual trading operations and postal communications would be restored.
