A further letter (folios 308-09) from Sheil to Kemball, dated 13 April 1853, in which Sheil writes that he is in agreement with Kemball in approving of the manner in which Commodore George Robinson executed his duties, and of the proposal to donate fifty Tomas to Mahmood Khan for his efforts towards the suppression of the slave trade;3. Letter no.131 of 1853 (folio 310) from Kemball to William Taylour Thomson, His Majesty's Charge D'Affairs at the Court of Persia, Tehran, 23 May 1853.
