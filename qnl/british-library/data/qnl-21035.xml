The Agency Bahrain. 15/T/22. The Hon'ble the Political •Keaidant, Bu shire • J Your Daml-Oftftolal telegram 4th,Ho 117.6. On receipt of the abovep I was about to reply that it seenod too late to mte the change indiof ted.when I was afforded an opportunity which has enabled me to carry oat yoar wishes. Monani had always given me to understand that he was in receipt of Rs500 for Quarantine work and I offorsd that fis-ure to Dane for acting and Woodsell understood he would continue to get it. About a week ago Woodsell received Hs loo from the Shaiks Officials I which they stated was his Quarantine salary for a month. I vent int. the matter with Shaik Hamad who produced evidence that years ago Monai got Rs loo for t his work.but subsequently Yusuf ICanoo interced ed for him with the Shaiks and it was raised to I5o and rafex* later to 200 and then to 250 with a donkey allowance of ±ts 12 par mensem,on the condition he attended the Shaiks familiy free. All , 1 these arrangements appear to have been conducted privately &amp; without the information of the agency.and it appears that beforo he ' eft Uonaii advised the Shaik to revert to the old rates for his sucoes.,o. I explained to Shaik Hamad that the salary everywhere was Rs 150. and it has been agreed that his salary shall be fixed at this sum which will in future be paid through the Agency and will not be . altered without the knowledge of the Political 'gent. Shaik Hamad then asked if the Doctor would enter, into an arrange -ient to attend the shaiks for about Rs loo per mensem. I replied that tus wot d not .be an official arrangement but fees due to his private prat oe and thtt he would probably be willing to accept,but any such payment was not to be lumped together and confused with the 0 fici. payment for Quarantine work. By this arrangement the Quarantine M.O. will be ''on an aqaal jfocting with 'thosa at# other s'ta'tions in the by reason of his private practice Woodsell will actually not receive far short of what he anticipated. This private practice is unof icif3 and could not at any ti$e be used as a handl# or given as grounds foi objection to transfer. I trust that you will approve of this arrangement • * I should like to mention that in the short time Woodsell has been here the work of the Hospital has inormously increased and in spite of the efforts of Mr Yusuf ianoo ^iio will have nothing to do with him,being annoyed at the transfer of Dr Monani who was a persona] i friend, he has become exceodingly popular with the inhabitants,number£ of whom have expressed satisfaction at his efficiency and praised his persoanl manner. yours sincerely y .

Political Agent writes that it would be impos sible for Assistant Surgeon to do Hospital Quarantine and Court work. He adds that former arrangement of Sheildi having his own quarantine Doctor never worked well and * latterly Sheikh has paid allowance of R? 300/- to our Assist ant Surgeon. He thinks this though scttisfactory to incumbent leads to inefficient*! in both Hospital and Quarantine work. He suggests that Sheikh should be invited to pay 300/- to Government for the services of an Assistant to the Jftiropean Assistant Surgeon instead of paying the allowance to the Assistant Surgeon. H© suggests an allowance of R? 150/- or 200/- for the Assistant Surgeon for Political work. I think that at least former amount would be required as Assistant Surgeon vroul I lose chance of Sheikh f s quarantine allowance. # I do not know whether this arrangement being rather complicated will commend itself to Government of -i -ndia, and it seems rather anomalous that if we have European Assistant surgeon at Bahrain he should n6t do quarantine 00 • Quarantine work however sometimes entails absence for hours at a time and I agree that Assistant Surgeon could not do it as well as hospital and court work. Residency Surgeon suggests that Assistant Surgeon should not be specifically nominated to Bahrain, out to Persian Gulf in case it is necessary or convenient to transfer him.

There is a very good opening for a good man &amp; the Job really seems good enough for a British Officer. Muscat has an Agency Surgeon (or had one) without half toe aousjats scope there is here. The Shaik is unabkle to deal with the Quarantine &amp; his ver inef icient doctor has Just gone off without making any arrange ments to carry on • I think the Sh. would possibly agree to pay to Govt the Rs 500 he has hitherto paid,for us to take on the Job jutflt* efficiently ,provided we also arranged to look after the school children which was one of the D ctors duties. In addition to this v the Baladleh want a Medical adviser &amp; would be willing to pay some regular salary for his services.

Shaikh Hamed desires me to write to you on the subject of Dr; R.D# Holmes, the Agency Surgeon, who besides his ordinary work is also His Excellency^ own physician and attends to his household, the Police and the Europeans and other officials of the State. His Excellency wishes me to express his great appreciation of Dr Holmes services, not only during his present indisposition but at all times since he came here about five years ago. ^ H.S. Shaikh Hamed has not at his disposal any official means of indic^tin^ hi* »*nd his peopled recognition of Dr Holme's services. He has instructed me to r^que-s-t that should there be any possibility of advancement or of awarding any sort of distinction to Dr Holmes such a proposal would meet with his entire approval and in his opinion it would be well deserved, I have the honour to be Sir, your obedient servant.

PoliticalnResident, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to state that the deputation of Assistant Surgeon R.Holmes from the Military Department as Quarantine r edical Officer, Bahrain will expir® in August this year, and to recommend most warmly that his services should be extended for another two years. I have ascertained from Mr Holmes that he is willing to remain here for another two years, and if an extension of his duty here is approved, he wishes to proceed on four months leave from the Ist July 1330. It would be of the greatest value if his tour of duty could be extended as requested, for he is of considerable va lue to the Agency politically. As you are aware, H.E.Shaikh Hamad suffers from diabetes and requires constant medical at tention. Re is much attached to Dr Holmes, and were it not for the latters patient efforts to malce the Shaiich keep to a proper diet his health woulfi be much worse than it is. If T&gt;r Holmes were to go, the Shaikh would undoubtedly look to the 'merican Mission for treatment, and the political effect would be undesirable. Apart from his careful treatment of the Shaikh, he . is very popular with the local Arabsgi both for his efficiency and courtQ^eus manners, and in addition he is very moderate in the fees he charges, and this popularity is of great value to the gency. I would be glad, therefore, if you would ar-Page 2. range for his deputation to Bahrain for a further period of two years, and, should this 'be accepted, the appoiximent of a reliable Assistant Surgeon to act for him during the four months of his leave. If for any reason it is not possible to extend his deputation as requested, Mr Holmes will then apply for a longer period of leave. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. m.
