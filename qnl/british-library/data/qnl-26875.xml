It will be appreciated that 'the most southerly palm in Safwan', may therefore soon have a different significance. 3.

I share your view about the desirability of extracting from His ^ ajest ’s Government a decision on policy and I do not disagree ' r ith the reconmendation you propose to make to the T 7ar Office as indicated in your paragraph 6, because the Port seems to have 1 ■ j&lt;: / i eared or tie ti e being from the local picture e.nd this appears to be a good opportunity for you to dismantle, i 1 you wish, all. that it may pay you to re o ir e on uhe plea that the material, ecui^ ment, etc., is required elsewhere in connexion with the war effort. Such action can be taken without any approach to Iraq ( and/or Koweit) which,if once made, would inevitably lead to a request t ri at everything be left in situ ^uo in case one or the other or both should ^ish to buy it. In this event, the problem of the frontier would at once arise. 3.. The above is, of course, written without prejudice to any interest His Majesty’s Government may have in preserving a port at Um Qasr and. in fact presup poses they have none. I put this question to the Foreign Office last February, but have so far had no reply. 4. One further point. At the end of your paragraph 5 you suggest that if Um Qasr assets should be disposed of to the Iraqis (o~ their Koweiti neighbours) in whole or in part, the Americans would -ant some public credit. I cannot see that this would be in any -ay objectionable from our point of view Yours sincerely, (Signed) KINAHAN CO UTIALLIS. Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Smith, K. B. E. , C.

Embassy Bagdad. 13th November, 1944 UM Q/i 3 R INSTALLATIONS ^ The future of the British Military Installation at UM QASR has, in ./b past been the subject of correspondence between this GHQ and the vritish Embassy. No decision has been reached as to its future disposal. It should be noted, however, that this GHQ has not carried out any demolitionsor the removal of any stores partly because it was hoped that there might be some guidance from London as to future policy and partly because it has been found possible to make use of UM QASR in a very limited capacity. 2. The situation now is changed and the installation no longer has any military use. It is actually now a liability owing to the necessity to guard the stores and because normal depreciation is taking place. As a result, it is considered that the position should be reviewed and the GHQ hopes to get a policy decision from the War Office on the action it is to take in the matter. Before doing so, however, owing to the political implications, the matter is being referred to you for any comments you may wish to make 3. The installations at UM QAGR, and most of the railway, signal, and water lines are understood to lie ,rr ithin the area which forms the subject of dispute between IRAQ and KUWAIT, In vie’* r of this fact, this GHQ has refrained from any action as to disposal. If, however, we take no action until after the dispute is settled, and this appears to be a post-war problem, we may well find ourselves unable to take any steps about demolishing the quays, etc., as well as the communications to the port from SHAI3A, as all personnel capable of such a task will have left. 4. This GHQ is not in a position to say whether the port of UM QASR would be of value as such in the post-war economy of either IRAQ or KUWAIT. It seems most probable, however, that the value lies in the stores such as railway lines, pipe lines, timber, etc., which are likely to be in world shortage for some years after the war. To dispose of the port in this manner would, of course, be a considerable financial loss to the treasury as stores are sold to foreign governments at vocabulary prices and not at cost price on site. We should thereby lose the value of the work done as well as incur the cost of dismantling. 5. There is one further complication which was not so apparent at any period in the past when the future of this port was considered. No survey has been made of the materials used and it is thought unlikely that much will be of Lend Lease origin. On the other hand, practically all the material is similar in type to that now supplied under the Lend Lease Agreement. As you know, the British Government does not agree to the USA contention that the latter has any interest in British goods similar to Lend Lease goods and the matter is still under discussion. It would naturally be impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to conceal as large a transaction as the sale of UM QASR as a whole or as stores. There might well, however, be repercussions with the USA should such a sale take place unless they were consulted. If this were done, the USA authorities would certainly insist that full publicity be given to the fact the British only find themselves in the position of assisting the IRAQ or KUWAIT governments by virtue of the co-operation of the USA. 6. This GHQ would like to demolish UM QASR now and to take the stores into stocks in our depots for disposal in the normal manner* by loan- military use of despatch to other theatres of operations. This can now be done with the resources available. Our resources are diminishing daily and unless the natter is taken in hand soon, it will not be possible. It is intended,therefore, to approach the War Office making this recommendation. Before doing so I should be grateful for any comments you may wish to make. (Signed) ARTHUR SMITH.

The question of whether the port would be needed after the wor was referred to the Dost hostilities Planning Sub-Committee in December, 1D43, (see minute of the &lt;s&lt;ind December, 1943 to Mr. Jebb, a copy of which was sent to Colonel le y.esurier at the War Office) but it appears that the Post Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee have not considered the port at Urn .asr to oe worthy of mention in their papers on the Middle East territories. Meanwhile the question of the future of strategic ports seems to have passed for consideration to the Joint Administrative Planning Staff and consequently wc suggest that, in order to reach a conclusion, the oest course would now be for the /ar Oiiice to refer General Smith’s proposal to the Chiefs of Staff in terns similar to those of the Foreign Office minute mentioned above, and to ask them for a decision. 01 .V ill/ Captain G.

Sir, Of ti • Under Seoratary of State for Foreign Affairs c*EG ' ****r*r t .Tz&gt;*xiJ* ■ r a 14th October, 1943. 14 OCT 1943 I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that at a meeting (the minutes of which are enclosed) held at the Foreign Office on the 27th August last, it was generally considered that the port under construction at Um Qasr, at the head of the Persian Gulf, should if possible be completed after the war and retained in British hands. 2. It was agreed at this meeting that, as a first step, the War Office should be asked to produce an estimate of the cost of the port as originally planned as a six-berth port, of which half of the berths hove been completed. The required information on this point is now available. It appears that the estimated costs for Um Qasr were as follows!- (a) Construction of 6 deep water berths 500* x 100’ wide, 6 road approaches and 2 rail approaches. (b) Dock cranes and gear for 6 berths (c) Port accommodation for personnel etc. ( d) Ra i 1 way UMSR - RAFIDIYAH £986,000 £220,242 say £500,000 £234,000 £1,940,242 f; Of these, (c) and (d) and one third of (a) have been completed, and thus, of a total estimate of £2,000,000, 50$ approximately will remain to be spent after the war if the port is to be completed to a 6 berth scale. 3. The next step, as agreed at the meeting, is an approach to the Treasury on the basis of this estimate, with a view to obtain general sanction for the completion of the port after the war at His Majesty’s Government’s expense. 4. It is clear that if Um Qasr is to be retained, the case for its retention must be based mainly on strategic grounds, although this would not necessarily preclude the possibility of arrangements being made for its use also for ordinary commercial purposes. If, therefore, Mr. Eden is to approach the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, he will require to be furnished with a memorandum embodying the joint recommendations of the Admiralty, the jjj[ar Office and the Air Ministry and outlining proposals for the future operation of the port. / The Secretary of the Admiralty. 5 ./7j» 5. It appears in fact that all three Service Departments are directly-concerned with this project. The Admiralty are concerned, in spite of the fact that the port is not required for purely naval purposes, “because if the proposal is put into effevCf , the Admiralty will pre-eumahly he the Government I)epL ent which will have to undertake the responsihility for operating the port. The Admiralty’s interest would, it is assumed, also extend to the possihility of the port being eventually used for the export of oil. The War Office are concerned, because one of the main military reasons for retaining the port in British control is in order to be able to use it, in case of need, as an advanced base in connexion with the defence of Abadan and the Persian oilfields; and the Army Council will appreciate that the defence of the important oil installations in Persia will have to be organised after the war, when British and Soviet forces have been withdrawn from Persian territory / from bases outside Persia*, The Air Ministry are concerned; if only because Um t*asr might be required in order to supply and reinforce the British air bases in Iraq, especially if the Shatt-al-Arab were closed. G. Mr. Eden would therefore suggest that if, after consultation, the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry are agreed on the desirability of a British military port at Um Qasr, they should furnish this department with a joint memorandum setting out fully their reasons for considering the project necessary or dec.rrble and, briefly, their proposals for the establishment an.I ^wx^cion of the port.

W. 1. 30th September, ! r. r-/ ' ■ — Ksl. y.' 3^ Sir, ja-W 5 r 4 O.Z. ! ’ ^ (2?) 1943. .S^ v I have now considered in consultation with departments concerned Your Excellency^ desoatoh No. 157 (108/21/43) of the 18th May, in which you reported your conversations with the Iraqi Prime Minister on the subject of the suggested cancellation of paragraph 3 of the notification regarding port dues at Um Qasr. 2. You may find it convenient to have a short history of the discussions that have taken place between 1938 and 1942 about the construction of a port on the Khor Zubair, and I accordingly enclose a note on this question which has oeen prepared in this department. It will be seen that General Nuri* s account of these discussions is inaccurate in one or two material points. In particular, His Excellency is wrong in saying that at no time had it been suggested that the Sheikh of Koweit was a claimant to the area in which it was proposed to construct the port. Amongst the aides m 6 moires which Taufiq Suwaidi prepared for his conversations in London during his visit in the autumn of 1938, was one on Koweit in which he specifically mentioned Um Qasr as the probable site of the port and admitted that the construction of an Iraqi port there would necessitate a slight rectification of the frontier. I enclose a copy of this aide m&amp;moire . 3. General Nuri is also inaccurate in saying that the ownership of the port site had never been called in question. As you pointed out, the present vague description of the frontier leaves a considerable area in doubt. Even ii under the 1940 interpretation the docks fall entirely in Iraq, other land required for the development of the port is indisputably in Koweiti territory (see your unnumbered telegram from Basra of the 25th February, 1942). 4. In these circumstances, while I appreciate the force of the arguments adduced by you in favour of leaving the matter in abeyance, I consider that it would be unwise to allow the issue of the offending notification to pass without some formal reservation. By this notification the Iraqi Government have arrogated to themselves certain rights in the port of Um Qasr which His Majesty’s Government do not necessarily admit they are entitled to exercise. It is not proposed at this stage to suggest that the frontier should be delimited, and the question of what means are open to His Majesty’s Government to achieve a satisfactory settlement oi the Koweiti-Iraqi dispute is still under consiaeration. But in order to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh of howeit it is essential that His Majesty’s Government should not by their silence lay themselves open to the imputation 01 having acquiesced in the notification and the claims implied in it. I consider, therefore, that a note should be addressee to the Iraqi Government which, while not inviting any reply, should make it clear that no action taken by the Iraqi Government with regard to the port of Um Qasr can be held in any way to prejudice/ His Excellency ^ _ „ - r „ v Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, G.C.M.G., u.b.js.., etc., etc. , etc., Bagdad.1 prejudice the question of where the frontier lies, I enclose a draft note on these linesi hut before instructing you to present it to the Iraqi Govemraent, I should welcome Your Excellency’s observations by telegraph. 5, Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India and to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

I think the draft despatch is entirely suitable except for one small point of wording in the middle of the second page, and the draft note to the Iraqi Government should sufficiently safeguard our position; but I see great objection to the reference in the note to the 1 %£ formula, and I think we should press for this to be omitted. I attach a draft letter to the Foreign Office making suggestions on the above lines. I have shown the papers to Mr. Caroe, who agrees. As regards the longer term question of settling the Koweit-Iraqi frontier dispute in this area, you will see that Sir Maurice Peterson apparently favours the idea of continuing to run the port ourselves, and he seems to be hopeful that the Treasury could be persuaded to put up the money. I am not sure that this will be so,unless the Service Departments take a much more enthusiastic view of the importance of the port than they did at the meeting, but the permanent control of the port by H.M.G. would no doubt be a satisfactory solution so far as the Sheikh of Koweit is concerned. On the other hand, as I pointed out at the meeting, this arrangement would not automatically solve the boundary dispute, because it would still be necessary for H.M.G. to pay a lease for the port^divided between Iraq and Koweit according to their respective ownership of the port area and its approaches. Mr. Oaroe feels, and I think /rightlyrightly, that the only way to arrive at a solution of the boundary problem is to get it off the paper and tackle it on the ground. Ke would therefore favour, as a preliminary step, sendingjmt a party, fsay, one representative from the Baghdad Embassy,^one from the Political Resident with a neutral Chairman,) to attempt to come to some agreed solution on the spot. If once we were agreed in this way between ourselves, it would obviously make it much easier to press the Iraqis and the Sheikh of Koweit to accept a delimitation of tie frontier.33 n any further communication on this subject, please quote No. and address- riot to any 'person by name, but to— ' The Under-Secrotary of State,’ Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

His Excellency is wrong in saying that at no time had it been suggested that the Sheikh of Kowelt was a claimant to the area in which it was proposed to construct the port* Amongst the aides m&amp;aoires which Teufiq Suwaldi prepared for his conversations in London during his visit in the autumn of 1933* was one on Koweit in which he specifically mentioned tin Qasr as the probable site of the port and admitted that the construotlor of an Iraqi port there would necessitate a slight rectification of the frontier* I enclose a copy of this aide mlmolre 3* General Hurl is also inaccurate in saying that the ownership of the port site had never been called In question* As Your Excellency pointed out, the present vague description of the frontier leaves a considerable area in doubt* Ever*/* 5 j- J - L. ■. w * ■*-“ i 943 ■ v.r »* 3 t..■mOTlT. -.-r* -&amp;—.^ Evan if undar the 1940 interpretation tha docks fall entirely in Iraq, other land required for the development of the port la indisputably in Koweiti territory (see your unnumbered telegram from Basra of the 25th February, 1942), 4* In these circumstances, while I appreciate the force of the arguments adduced by you in favour of leaving the matter in abeyance, I consider that it would be unwise to allow the j issue of the offending notification to pass without some formal reservation* By this notification the Iraqi Government have arrogated to themselves certain rights in the port of tta Qasr which His Majesty's Government do not necessarily admit they are entitled to exercise* It is not proposed at this stage to suggest that the frontier should be delimited, and whet further approach should be made to the Iraqi Government in order to resolve| the Koweits-Iraqi ? _ ^ dispute is still under consideration* But in \ iu K ^~ W t 8 M £ order to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh of Kowelt it is essential that His Majesty's Government should not by their silence lay themselves open to the imputation of having acquiesced in the notification and the claims Implied in it* I consider, therefore, that a note should be addressed to the Iraqi Government which, while not inviting any reply, should make it clear that no action taken by the Iraqi Government with regard to the port of l&amp;n Qasr can be held in any way to prejudice the question of where the frontier lies* I enclose a draft note on these lines, but before instructing you to present it to the Iraqi Government I should tr t (* ft * jl welcome Your Excellency's observations by telegraph. rUX* An 13 5122/1214/93 H.S4.3.

His Majesty’s .Ambassador put forward, in a note addressed to the Iraqi Minister ft&gt;£ Poreign Affairs on the 7th October, 1940, an interpretation of the frontier which so far the Iraqi Goverovaent have not seen their way to accept* That the Ireii Government themselves were aware that the i rritory in this area was in dispute is shown by an aide m^noire on Koweit enclosed in a letter dated the 28th September, 1936 from the then Iraqi Foreign Minister to the United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations, in which Sayid Teufiq Suweidi expressed the view that if a site for a port were chosen on the ; w lt*£**p inland extension of the iOior Abdullah called • A q * V i v Khor zubair, a slight rectification of tha :/ £ iw-. ■xWv* T £ ' r,o '- u ~ frontier would be involved* &lt;sl . ,— ^ 1 3* It is clear, therefore, that until the ^ , frontier has been demarcated it is iiapossible to ^ i &lt; •'— f ■■ '* ' q - i y- say with certainty how the frontier line when traced on the ground will be with reference to the/th« present port area of Urn Uaer# It ie not the intention of His Majesty f e Government to propose that any stops should be taken to delimit the fror^.er in the present circumstances but in view of the notification issued by the Iraqi Director-General of Ports and Navigation, referred to above they think it well formally to notify the Iraqi Government that nothing that is done or has been done with regard to the port of Um Qasr can be held in any way to prejudice the question of where the frontier lies.(S 3138/124/93). In 1938 the Iraqi Government informed us of their desire to have another outlet to the sea in addition to Basra. At first the possibility was considered of finding a site in Koweit Bay, hut it was later decided that a port somewhere on the Khor Zuhair would he better. It may he noted that in raising the question in 1938 Taufiq Suwaidi (then Iraqi Foreign Minister) mentioned Urn Qasr specifically as a probable site and referred to the necessity of altering the Koweit-Iraq frontier in favour of Iraq in order to place the site in Iraqi territory. (E5703/2094/93 of 1938). In subsequent discussions between the interested Departments in London two alternative sites were considered, one on the North and one on the South side of Urn Qasr Creek (the small inlet off the Khor Zubair just North of Um Qasr itself); it was thought that while the former site would certainly be in Iraq, the latter would probably be in Koweit (E 5116/ and S 6224/53/93) of 1939). It was decided to communicate to the Iraqi Government the conclusions reached by the British authorities regardihg the practicability of constructing a port somewhere on the Khor Zubair and in September 1939 Sir John Ward gave the Minister of Communications and Jorks a report on a survey which he had made of the Khor Abdullah * (see E 6801/58/93 of 1939). It is true that in his report Sir John Ward referred specifically to a port ^just below Um ^asr Creek' and we might have been well-advised to tell the Iraqis there and then that a port on this site would impinge on Koweiti territory (this was certainly our view at the time). But apart from the fact that we had every reason to believe that the Iraqis were aware of the position (vide Taufiq Suwaidi’s statement in 1938 about rectifying the frontier), it was clearly our intention to wait until the Iraqis had decided where they wanted the port to be before offering any comments on the possible political complications. We were in fact still hoping - and continued to do so until the whole position changed in 1941 - that the Iraqis would decide to have the port !■ orth of Um Qasr Creek, in which case no complications as regards the^ land frontier would have occurred. In any case, Sir John .ard’s report did not mention the question of the frontier or the difficulties which might arise with Koweit if the Iraqis decided on the site South of Um Qasr Creek; it confined itself to examining the practicability of the project in relation to the physical requirements which would have to be fulfilled. In November 1939 the Iraqi Foreign Minister (Ali Jaudat; informed Kis Majesty's Ambassador that the Iraqi Government had been favourably impressed by Sir John '.Yard' s report and decided to build a port 'near Um Qasr' (3 7601/58/93 1 '.-j39). He went on to say that it would be necessary to obtain certain territorial concessions from the Skeikh of Koweit in order to safeguard the aoproaches to the proposed port by securing Iraqi sovereignty/ * This term was used loosely at the time and on other occasions as including the Khor Zubair.1 rtr sovereignty over toth tanks of the channel connecting it with the open sea; and he apparently considered it sufficient for this purpose that Koweit should cede Warbah and Bubiyan islands to Iraq. It will he seen that the phrase ’'near Um Qasr H still left the exact location of the port in doubt, although the specific mention in Sir ^ John .ard’s report of a site ”just below Um Qasr Greek” and Ali JaudatVs reference to the report leaves little room for doubt that what the Iraqis- had in mind at this stage was a port located on the Southern and ,estern side of Um Qasr creek. However that may be, it appears that at this time we still preferred to wait until the Iraqis had indicated the exact location which they had chosen for the port before O oing Into the question of the land frontier; in a letter written to the India Office after receiving Ali Jaudat’s proposals we contented ourselves with registering the fact that ,f the Iraqi ”Government can in fadt build on Iraqi territory a port of their H own which would be adequate to their immediate needs and would ”have access to the, sea through,Iraqi territorial waters, without ”obtainin 0 £ng territorial concessions from. Koweit ' (E 7601/58/95 of 1339). In February 1940 General Uuri, who was then Foreign Minister, invoked our support in obtaining territorial concessions from I Koweit to safeguard the approaches to. the port and f, hinted vaguely that some common regime mig'ht be established similar to that of the Iraqi-Saudi neutral zone” as a-possible solution (E 1033/630/93 of 1940). It is clear from a letter addressed to us by the India Office in April 19&lt;t0 (E 1760/650/93) and connected correspondence that at this time all Departments were still agreed that if the Iraqis built a port Forth of Um Qasr Creek it would be in Iraq,but that if they built one South of the. Creek it would probably be at least partly in Koweit (see particularly paragraphs 2 and 3 of the despatch from the Political Resident enclosed' with the India Office letter;. It was.also agreed that, since the Sheikh of Koweit had expressed his unwillingness to make any territorial concessions, none should be demanded of him and therefore that if the Iraqis wished to have a port on the Khor Zubair, it must be situated in their own territory (telegram to Bagdad in E 1883/630/93 of 1940). At this stage the,Iraqi Government asked us to help them to finance the construction of the proposed port. This we refused to do and, no doubt because of our refusal, the Iraqis did not I proceed with the project. The whole question thereupon lay dormant for a year until it ; was brought up again in June 1941 by the sudden decision of our own military‘authorities to develop a port at Um Qasr as an urgent operational necessity (E 2687/2687/93 of 1941). Pending definite information regarding the site chosen for the port we merely informed the Iraqi Government that it had been decided for military reasons to construct an emergency port '*at or near Um Qasr ’ 1 and that the port would remain under our control for the duration of the war (see telegram to Bagdad on E 3762/2687/93, the first paragraph of which shows that we still thought that the site South of Um Qasr Creek would be wholly or partly outside Iraq.) In August 1941 Sir i% Kinahan Cornwallis reported that the site chosen was that South of ft j Um Qasr Creek and we thereupon asked him whether the .Northern I site could not be used instead, in order to avoid a controversy over the frontier (S 4647/2687/93 of 1941). In reply Sir Kinahan , Cornwallis reported at the beginning of September (E 5286/2687/93 ; of 194l) that after examining a large scale map he was of the^ 1 opinion that the Southern site was undoubtedly on the Iraqi side | of the boundary line as defined in the new interpretation which we proposed/Copy . {E5703/2094/93) 3^ €) (Extract U.K* Delegation, Geneva TTo* 106). - -V J L 1 . Do. 3 - KUWAIT. 51:82 Kuwait presents a two-folfl. problem for Iraq: (a) it has become an entrepot fSk&lt;r Sxten alive _ „ . i^»srr.-wr arms traffic and smuggling; (b) it bars Iraq’s access to the open sea. 3. As regards (b), Iraq’s only channel of access to the sea is at present the Shatt-al-Arab. The Iraqi Government feels that it is of vital importance to secure an alternative for the following reasons: (a) the recent dispute with IraQ has emphasised the unreliability of the Shatt line: Iran is in a position to interrupt it at any time; (b) the Shatt tends to become more and more . • - congested with the development of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. If oil is discovered in the Basra Wilayat, developments of equal magnitude may be expected, and these must not be restricted*by the Shatt-al-Arab bottle neck; (c) after completion of the Tell-Kochik-Bagdad section of the railway, the 'Government proposes to extend the line as far south as possible with a view to inaugurating a fast passenger service to India, and shares the view of the original promoters of the Bagdad railway, that the terminus should be on the sea and not on the Shatt-al-Arab. 5. If His Majesty’s Government will agree to the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraq, the two problems referred to in paragraph 1 will be automatically solved. If not, the solution of each must be found separately.7 . As regards direct access to the sea, two alternative positions for a port•and railway terminus suggest themselves for investigation:- . . . (a) a suitable.site to be selected on Kuwait Bay; (b) the inland extensiqn of the Khor Abdullah, named on- the map Khor Zubair. If the first alternative is found preferable, it would be necessary for Iraq to lease from Kuwait a site for a port on the Bay, and a corridor for the railway line. The second would involve a slight rectification of the frontier - that proposed under paragraph 6 (b) above would be more than ample - at the eastern end --so as to give sufficient room atUmm Qasr (a probable site) -and^leave the whole of the Khor Abdullah in Iraq. Pending further■investigation the Iraqi Government would be glad to be assured that His Majesty’s Government, in principle, would be disposed to consider favourably either alternative. vi1. MR. PEEL said that he thought the Sheikh of Koweit would have no objection to our keeping the port ourselves, but he was determined not to let the Iraqis have it and would prefer us to destroy the works already constructed rather than hand the port over to Iraq. There was some discussion whether the port could be developed without including some Koweiti territory. While different opinions were expressed on this point, it was clear that the port could not be approached without passing through Koweiti waters. SIR M. PETERSON said that it was clear that it would be necessary as a first step to send a formal communication to the Iraqi 'Government about the notification referred to above, which would safeguard our own position and that of the Sheikh of Koweit. This note should be couched in terms which would not require any reply. ‘it was agreed that the Foreign Office and India Office should draft a note on these lines. SIR M. PETERSON said that the next question was what steps should be taken to resolve the Koweiti-Iraqi dispute. We could either suggest that the dispute be put, t.Q arbitration, or else evolve some modus vivendi which would leave us in control. Besides the reasons given above for retaining the port in our ownhands, it was possible that the Basra Petroleum Company might develop oilfields in Southern Iraq after the war, and that the port would thus be useful as an outlet for their oil. CAPTAIN GELL said that if we were able to get oil out through Um Qasr and thus could avoid the use of the 3 hatt-al-Arab altogether in case of necessity, the Admiralty would certainly take a far greater interest in the port. It was finally agreed that the War Office should be asked to produce an estimate of the cost of the port as originally planned as a t 6 berth port of which li berths have been completed, and,on the basis of this estimate Treasury sanction should be sought by the Foreign Office, with the concurrence of the interested Departments, for the completion of the port after the war at H.M.G./s expense. If the approval of the Treasury was obtained, the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Kovreit could then be approached. The method of approach would be for further discussion but the best line might be that H.M.G. should complete the port at their own expense and should retain control of it, and that each side should lease such portion of their territory as was necessary to H.M.G.Cop/?^' (E 4385/124/95) SECRET MSC.55. i^a 5-/ Dear Baxter, Military SuB-Committee, oe.

Draft letter to Foreign Office. iLfc ct» V o . footvji Jl ? 3 JU(. !94$MINUTE It will be remembered that in February - March we concerted with the Foreign Office the instructions given to H.M. Ambassador at Bagdad with regard to a Notification (copy at Ext.5066/42) issued by the Iraqi Government levying dues on shipping using the port of Um Qasr and its approaches. Objection had been taken to the Notification on the ground that the Iraqis have no right to legislate, or to appear to legislate, either for the port itself, which lies on the disputed frontier between Iraq and Koweit.? and is being administered by the British military authorities during the war, or for its approaches, part of which are Koweit territorial waters. V Ext.870/43 1228/43 1387/43 2. The instructions given to Sir K. Cornwallis were briefly as follows. He was to inform the Prime '.linister orally that the services at the port itself, for which dues were charged under para. 3 of the Notification, were in fact being performed by the British military authorities who, as the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Koweit were aware, were administering the port during the war* hence this paragraph was inappropriate, and the military authorities were approaching the Basra Port Directorate for its cancellation as a matter of form. After the cancellation of para.3&gt; the Ambassador was to address a note to the Iraqi Government emphasising that the performance by the Basra Port Directorate of the services enumerated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Notification (i.e. those relating to the approaches to the port) and the levy of charges by the Directorate for these services, in no way prejudiced 'the rights of the Sheikh in that part of the water which belongs to Koweit. 3* Sir K. Cornwallis duly made his oral approach to the Prime Minister, only to be met with a firm refusal to agree to the cancellation of para .3 on the ground that this would constitute an abrogation of Iraq's sovereign rights. Nuri Pasha took the line that there had never been any question but that the port was in Iraqi territory, and that in consequence the collection of port dues there was of no concern to the Sheikh of Koweit. In these circumstances Sir K. Cornwallis has made no written consnunication to the Iraqi Government, but has recommended to the Foreign Office that the whole matter should be left in abeyanc e.^ more particularly as the military authorities have now decided that, barring unforeseen developments, it will not be necessary to bring the port into use and that it can be kept on a care and maintenance basis. (Bagdad telegram No.409 of May 4th and despatch No.167 of May 18th). 4* Para. 3 of Bagdad telegram No*409 says that so far as Sir K* Cornwallis can discover (the Embassy's records having been destroyed during Rashid Ali's rebellion) all the discussions prior to 1941 were conducted on the basis that if a port were to be built at Um Qasr it would be in Iraq. But in a note, a copy of which will be found below the Bagdad desu|itcfo^ I.^r. Etherington-Sraith of the Foreign Office has analysed tne^we^is, 1 reaching the conclusion that, with the exception of a period of one month in September 1941, during which nothing was said to the Iraqis, the Sbreign Office always thought that a port south of Um Qasr Creek (viz. on the site ultimately chosen) would be in disputed territory. It is proposed to ask the Foreign Office to put Sir K. Cornwallis right about this. 5* After consulting the Political Resident on the Embassy's despatch, the Government of India have now sent us a telegram in which they suggest that H.M.G-. should tell the Iraqi Government: - (a) that whether or not the Iraqi.

It would follow that unilateral administration by Iraq, if administration of the port should ever become necessary, is not a prospect in which H,M,G-, could concur. 6 . These two points appear sound, l_ The first of them seems to apply to the port area only since, even if the port is kept on a care and maintenance basis, it may still be necessary to employ the Basra Port Directorate for dredging etc, in its approaches. This leaves open the possibility that the Directorate may have occasion to levy dues for such services upon any shipping, even if only dhows, which may use the channels leading to the port, Para, 4 of our letter No, Ext, 870/43 of March explained to the Foreign Office why we should much prefer that the collection of these dues should be undertaken by the military authorities, who would hand over the proceeds to the Basra Port Directorate, We subsequently agreed not to press this point and we reluctantly agreed lb para, 2 of Foreign Office telegram No, 202 of March l 6 th (Ext. 1387/43)* We made this concession, however, on the assumption that para, 3 of the Notification would be cancelled. Since Sir K,Cornwallis has failed to effect this, it would appear that we are entitled to insist that, if there should be any occasion for the collection of dues for services rendered in the waterway by the Basra Port Directorate, such dues should be collected by &amp;£* military authorities at Urn Qasr,^ 1^* 7, The draft below proposes that the Foreign Office should instruct Sir K, Cornwallis to make a declaration to the Iraqi Government on the lines suggested by the Government of India, -with ■hhA, -a^-Sf-irYn r^n-^vi -i „ 4-lnn ^ The draft refers to Foreign Office letter of May 22nd, which wejneld up pending receipt of Sir K. Cornwallis’s despatch Nb.167 and any comments thereon by the Government of India and the Political R e sident, so that all aspects of the matter may be dealt with together. In that letter the Foreign Office suggesiejfthat - irrespective of what was done about the Notification - a further effort should be made to deal with the whole question of the frontier ^oKspecifically f they proposed that the frontier question should be submitted to international arbitration as soon as possible after the war; and that any arrangements made in the meantime with regard to UmQasr should be without prejudice to the question of where the frontier lies. 8 , While we may express sympathy with the Foreign Office proposal for a further effort to taclde the basic question of the frontier, it would seem desirable that, before we consult the | Government of India and the Political Resident, we should have a clearer idea of the justification for, and what is involved in, the specific course of action outlined in their letter. For this purpose it would appear desirable that there should be oral discussion between our two Departments; and from a letter from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty, of which we have just received a copy, it seems that they themselves contemplate an early meeting with us. The draft therefore confines itself to suggesting oral discussion and to consnenting on two points of (11704) \Vt.26090/P.282 10,000 9/30 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 fundamental/fundamental importance in connection with the Foreign Office proposals, With regard to the first of these points it is of course necessary that, before the frontier is demarcated on the spot,all parties should be agreed upon a general paper definition of the boundary line. To this end H.M. Ambassador at Bagdad evolved in 1940 a formula which was (unfortunately from the point of view of Koweit and those concerned with protecting her interests) accepted by the ^litical authorities, the Government of India and the Foreign and India Offices, as well as by the Sheikhj but the Iraqi Government, while making no comnent on the formula, suggested that the whole question of demarcation should be postponed. Para. 4(a) of the draft is intended to suggest that it might conceivably be practicable to evolve a new formula — in supersession of that advanced in 1940 - which would be acceptable to all parties. It might be worth while attempting this, if thereby we could avoid all the trouble, publicity and possibilities of bad feeling involved in staging sin international arbitation. But a necessary preliminary would be that the India Office and Foreign Office should resolve their domestic diffCfcfcfcCies with regard to the^. alignment of the frontier; and for this purpose it be necessary to make a reference to the Law Officers of the Grown* This would involve much labour which might turn I out to be fruitless if the resultant formula were not accepted by the Iraqi Government.

Reference: G.H.Q. memo. No.1025/G(0) of 9th April, 1943. prior consultation an approach has been made to the Iraqi military authorities with a view to the protection of installations at Um Qasr by Iraqi troops. It is the policy of His Majesty’s Government, laid down over a year ago, that the port of Um Qasr should be administered entirely by the British military authorities and that neither Iraq nor Koweit should take any share in the organisation. It follows that under no circumstances should units of the Iraqi Army - or any other Iraqi institution - be permitted to be stationed within the port area. This essential requirement was fully appreciated by Headquarters, Tenth Army, and careful account was taken of it in their memorandum to General Headquarters, Middle East Forces, No. 1 Q 86 /G(SD) 1 (a) of the 13th April, 1942, which submitted recommendations for the development of the port. 2. In order to avoid reviving during the war the boundary dispute between Iraq and Koweit, special care has been taken to ensure that the Iraqi Government should not suspect that the reasons demanding a British military administration in the port area (part of which, in any event, is indisputably in Knweiti territory and part indisputably in Iraqi territory) are in any way political. It is accordingly essential that General Headquarters, in withdrawing their request for the provision of Iraqi troops for duties in the area, should explain that this revised decision is the result of more recent instructions from the War Office relating to military dispositions within the Command, (without making any reference to the political factor whatsoever). His Majesty’s Embassy regrets to note that withoutI (£. 3/3 y No. TIo 16Y 8721/43) /f .A /^y &gt;^o4- 7 At i 5% —*&gt; o^. v* ^ ^Xk v A''- With the CompHnwnig ithe d .® r ^^tery pf 3 tat to ' 1 t--.- 10^ 0t6V&gt;3 British Embassy, Bagdad, l^th'May, 1943. 'fp % A o . V&gt; With reference to my teleg ram No. 409 o f the 4th May, I have the honour to confirm that, when I spoke to the Prime Minister on the subject, His Excellency was adamant in refusing to agree to the cancellation of paragraph 3 of the notification regarding port dues at Um Qasr. ^.s recorded in my telegram. General Kuri would not admit that the Shaikh of Koweit was in any way concerned in the matter, nor would he agree that it was more appropriate for the British Military authorities, who would be performing the services, to issue their own notification regarding charges. , . u j . j . t ° r 2 . in a long disquisition on the history of the port the ^Prime Minister observed that the project had first been mooted at a time when Perso-Iraqi relations were strained and Iraq was looking for an access to the sea which would be immune from Persian interference. He recalled that His Majesty’s Government had been asked to arrange for the cession of Warbah and Bubiyan Islands in order that Iraq might control the approaches absolutely but had been unwilling to do so; his point was, however, that the ownership of the port site had never been called in question. (In this &gt; account General Nuri omitted to mention that the original proposal had been for a port on Koweit Bay itself, but the point does not seem to be of importance.)' Furthermore, the^Iraqi Parliament had, before and since the outbreak of hostilities, voted and spent money on surveys and ; dredging. At no time had it been suggested that the Shaikh of Koweit was a claimant to the area in which it was proposed to construct the port. 3. I pointed out to His Excellency that the frontier had not been demarcated and that, until this was done, the present vague description left a considerable area in doubt. I recalled further that I had informed him of our intention to construct a military port at Um Qasr and of our desire that the military authorities should themselves administer it without interference. He admitted the latter point and claimed that he hud in fact left us a free hand. At the same time and while he would be most reluctant in any way to impede the war effort, it would be too much to expect him to agree to the cancellation of the notification and thereby admit that the ownership of the port site was in doubt. He sincerely trusted that I should not have to raise the matter with him officially. The Um Qasr port project was familiar to everyone, having frequently been discussed in parliament and the press. If now he had to make it knov/n that His Majesty's Government disputed Iraq's title to the site, it would be impossible to avoid an acute political crisis, which must seriously disturb our present relations of close friendship and co-operation. 4 . With the destruction of my records prior to May, 1941, it is impossible for me to comment in detail on the genesis of the Um Qasr project. So far as I can Judge, however, the main concern of His Majesty's Government at the time before Um Qasr was definitely selected was that any port should be in Iraqi territory. Um Qasr appears to have been acceptable as a site on this/ ThenRight Honourable Anthony Eden M.C., M.P.,this ground. If, then, it transpires that the site of the present military port is identical with (or lies to the North of) that selected before the war, the Iraqi Government would have good reason for claiming that His Majesty's Government had ^ recognised the site as being in Iraq. It is furthermore the case that by the definition of the frontier proposed to the Iraqi Government in 1940 the present docks 0 would 0 lie in Iraq ; 0 this fact was accepted, as stated in my telegram No. 1 Tour of the 26th February, 1942, by the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and, while it is true that the Iraqi Government never saw fit to signify their agreement to this definition^, its existence is, surely, a stronger argument in their favour than any that could be based on a unilateral^act such as the publication of a scale of port dues, which will in fact be 0 inoperative. 5. While, therefore, I do not suggest that His Majesty's Government should here and now concede that the site of the port is in Iraqi territory, I consider that, u ss a matter of political expediency, we should abandon the attempt to secure cancellation of the offending paragraph of the Iraqi Government's notification. It is possibly of ipcidental interest to add that the Army, having spent a large sum on the port, have lately decided; in the light of the improved military situation, to stop further development and reduce the whole area to a care and maintenance basis. 6 .

Note on discussions between 1938 and 1942 regarding the construction of a port on the Khor Zubair, with reference to the question of the Koweit-Irao frontier . In 1938 the Iraqi Government informed us of their desire to have another outlet to the sea in addition to Basra. At first the possibility was considered of finding a site in Koweit Bay, but it was later decided that a port somewhere on the Khor Zubair would be better. . It may be noted that in raising the question in 1938 Taufiq Suwaidi (then Iraqi Foreign Minister) mentioned Urn Qasr specifically as a probable site and referred to the_ jieceasity of altering the Koweit-Iraq frontier in favour of Iraq in order to place the site in Iraqi terrTtbry. (E 57(13/2094/93 of 19 38). . . In subsequent discussions between the interested Departments in London two alternative sites were considered, one on the North and one on the South side of Urn Qasr Creek (the small inlet off the Khor Zubair just North of Urn Qasr itself); it was thought that while the former site would certainly be in Iraq, the latter would probably be in Koweit (E 5116 and E 6224/58/93 of 1939). It was decided to communicate to the Iraqi Government the conclusions reached by the British authorities regarding the practicability of constructing a port somewhere on the Khor . Zubair and in September 1939 Sir John Ward gave the Minister of Communications and Works a report on a survey which he had made of the Khor Abdullah + (see E 6801/58/93 of 1939). It is true that in his report Sir John Ward referred specifically to a port U just below Urn Qasr Creek'* and we might have been well- advised to tell the Iraqis there and then that a port on this site would impinge on Koweiti territory (this was certainly our view at the time). But apart from the fact that we had every reason to believe that the Iraqis were aware of the position (vide Taufiq Suwaidi*s,statement in 1938 about rectifying the frontier), it was clearly our intention to wait until the Iraqis had decided where they wanted the port to be before offering any comments on the possible political complications. We were in fact still hoping - and continued to do so until the whole position changed in 1941 - that the Iraqis would decide to have the port North of Urn Qasr Creek, in which case no complications as regards the land frontier would have occurred. In any case, Sir John Ward*s report did not mention the question of the frontier or the difficulties which might arise with Koweit if the Iraqis decided on the site South of Urn Qasr Creek; it confined itself to examining the practicability of the project in relation to the physical requirements which would have to be fulfilled. In November 1939 the Iraqi Foreign Minister (Ali Jaudat) informed His Majesty's Ambassador that the Iraqi ^ Government had been favourably impressed by Sir John Ward s reoort and had decided to build a port 'hiear._IIm—Qnsr (E~7601/58/93 of 1939). He went on to say that it would be necessary to obtain certain territorial concessions from the Sheikh of Koweit in order to safeguard the approaches to the proposed port by securing Iraqi sovereignty over both banks of the channel connecting it with the open sea; and he apparently considered it sufficient for this purpose that Koweit should cede Warbah and Bubiyan islands to Iraq. It will be seen that the phrase 'near Um Qasr' still left the exact location of the port in doubt, although the specific mention in Sir John Ward s report of a site 'just below Um Qasr Creek' and Ali Jaudat s reference to the report leaves little room for doubt that what the Iraqis had in mind at this stage was a port located on the Southern and Western side of Um Qasr creek. however that may be. it appears that at this time we still preferred to wait until + This term was used loosely at the time and on o occasions as including the Khor Zubair. ther the/the Iraqis had indicated the exact location which they had chosen for the port before going into the question of the land frontier; in a letter written to the India Office after receiving Ali Jauda^s proposals we contented ourselves with registering the fact that 'the Iraqi Government can in fact build on Iraqi territory a port of their own which would be adequate to their immediate needs and would have access to the sea through Iraqi territorial waters, without obtaining any territorial concessions from Koweit ' (E 7601/58/93 of 1939). In February 1940 General Nuri, who was then Foreign Minister, invoked our support in obtaining territorial concessions from Koweit to safeguard the approaches to the port, and 'hinted vaguely... that some common regime might be established similar to that of the Iraqi-Saudi neutral zone' as a possible solution (E 1033/630/93 of 1940). It is clear from a letter addressed to us by the India Office in April 1940 (E 1760/630/93) and connected correspondence that at this time all Departments were still agreed that if the Iraqis built a port North of Urn Qasr Creek it would be in Iraq, but that if they built one South of the Creek it would probably be at least partly in Koweit (see particularly paragraphs 2 &amp; 3 of the despatch from the Political Resident enclosed with the India Office.letter). It was also agreed that, since the Sheikh of Koweit had expressed his unwillingness to make any territorial concessions, none should be demanded of him and therefore that if the Iraqis wished to have a port on the Khor Zubair, it must be situated in their own territory (telegram to Bagdad in E 1883/630/93 of 1940). At this stage the Iraqi Government asked us to help them to finance the construction of the proposed port. This we refused to do and, no doubt because of our refusal, the Iraqis dia not proceed with the project. The whole question thereupon lay dormant for a year until it was brought up again in June 1941 by the sudden decision of our own military authorities to develop a port at Urn Qasr as an urgent operational necessity (E 2687/2687/93 of 1941). Pending definite information regarding the site chosen for the port we merely informed the Iraqi Government that it had been decided for military reasons to construct an emergency port 'at or near Urn Qasr' and that the port would remain under our control for the duration of the war (see telegram to Bagdad on E 3762/2687/95, the first paragraph of /&lt;/•/ which 'shows that we still thought that the site South of Urn Qasr Creek would be wholly or partly outside Iraq.) In August 1941 Sir Kinahan Cornwallis reported that the site chosen was that South of Um Qasr Creek and we thereupon asked him whether the Northern site could not be used instead, in order to avoid a controversy over the S\xllI(LI frontier f E 4647/2687/95 of 1941) . In reply Sir Kinahan Cornwallis tIt reported alPthe beginning of September ( E 5286/2687/93 of 1944) that after examining a large scale map he was of the opinion that the Southern site was undoubtedly on the Iraqi side of the boundary line as defined in the new interpretation which we proposed to Koweit and Iraq in 1940. It was at this point that, for the first time, we began to think that a port on the South side of Urn Qasr Creek might lie wholly in Iraq. The other authorities concerned expressed their agreement with Sir Kinahan Cornwallis^ view, the proposal to use the Northern site was abandoned, and we were on the point of telling the Iraqis that it was our impression that the site for the new port was »in Iraq, when a telegram was received from the Political Resident early in October again throwing doubt on this assumption ( E 6447/2687/93 of 1941) . In consequence of this further steps were taken to establish the.exact location of the port in relation to the frontier.

Shortly afterwards Mr. Wakefield’s report was received and we then soon came into open disagreement with the India Office as to the correct interpretation of the frontier documents, so that there could be no question of our saying anything to the Iraqis which might imply that the port was in Iraq. In the meantime we took steps to have the whole port administered as a military area for the duration of the war, leaving the disputed question of the frontier in cold storage. It is, I think, clear from the above that with the exception of a period of one month in September 1941, during which we certainly said nothing to the Iraqis, we always thought that a port South of Urn Qasr Greek would be in disputed territory and that we never said anything, even by implication, which could have given the Iraqis the impression that we thought otherwise. It is moreover clear from what Taufiq Suwaidi said in his memorandum in 1938 that the Iraqis themselves considered at the time that the construction of a port for Iraq at Um Qasr would involve the cession of territory by Koweit. The Iraqis might, I suppose, argue that they changed their view as a result of the new interpretation of the frontier which we put forward in 1Q40; but the fact remains that His Majesty’s Government never committed themselves in any way.

(B 2628/124/93) My dear Peel, Would you please refer to your letter Ext. 870/43 of the 3rd March and previous correspondence about the problem of Um Qasr? You will no doubt have seen Bagdad telegram No. 409 of the 4th May , in v/hich Cornwallis reports that the Iraqi Prime Minister has refused to cancel paragraph 3 of the Port of Basra notification regarding the levying of dues and charges on vessels entering Um Qasr port. General Nuri f s refusal to withdraw the offending paragraph has further complicated the position and it may be necessary to consider whether any further action should be taken with the Iraqis on this particular question of the notification when the promised despatch from Bagdad and any comments from the Political Resident and the Government of India have been received. In the meantime however, we suggest for your consideration that a further effort should be made to deal with the whole question of the frontier, v/hich in view of the Iraqi Government’s attitude now threatens to rear its head again in an acute form and is of course at the bottom of the bother over the notification. If some arrangement could be reached with regard to the frontier question, which lies at the root of all the trouble, we should be relieved of further embarrassment in connexion with the Port of Basra notification and other similar* complications v/hich R.i’. Peel, Esq.* C.B*E., M,G•, India Office. /maymay arise either on the Iraqi or the Koweiti side. What we have in mind is that we should now take steps to get both Iraq and Kov/eit to agree: (1) that the frontier question should be submitted to an international arbitration to be held as soon as possible after the war and that the frontier should then be delimited in accordance with the decision of the arbitration, the arbitral tribunal remaining the judge of any disputes which may arise v/ith regard to the delimitation; v / ( 2 ) that any arrangements made in the meantime with K-Gv*- regard to Urn Qasr should be v/ithout prejudice to the question where the frontier lies. ft LZ It may be that this is as far as we need go for the J/wrf h r - ^ moment, but it would be convenient if we - could go further and reach now some agreement as to the nature of the arbitral tribunal, the place v/here it should sit, its constitution, etc. We might v/ork for agreement that the arbitral tribunal should have as its chairman Sir Cecil Hurst, (as an ex-President of the Permanent Court of International Justice), with or without two other arbitrators nominated by Iraq and Koweit (or the Governme nt of India for Koweit) respectively, or that the chairman should be a person nominated by Sir Cecil Hurst, if owing to other activities he cannot sit himself, and that the arbitration should take place in London. If this could be agreed, the Iraqi Government could appoint such counsel as they thought fit and argue the /point-ft point as they thought best; similarly, the Government of India and the Political Resident could argue the Sheikh’s case as they thought best and with such counsel as they might choose. The parties to the Arbitration might be the Iraqi Government, on the one side, and the Government of India, acting on behalf of the Sheikh of Koweit, on the other side; His Majesty’s Government remaining impartia l and supplying information and documents as required by 11 either party. It seems to us that an effort will now have to be made to reach some agreement over the fundamental question of the frontier and that the above would be the best way of tackling it. It would, of course, be possible to try to arrive at a solution of the difference of opinion which exists between the India Office and Foreign Office on the subject, e.g. by referring to the Lav/ Officers of the Crov/n for a ruling. This difference, v/hich is no doubt far less wide than that between the Iraqi Government and the Political Resident, is a complicating factor, but this course would entail a great deal of v/ork in submitting a complicated case to the Law Officers and v/ould in any event not offer a real solution, since any opinion which the Law Officers might give would not be binding on Iraq, and might not even be accepted by the Government of India. While such a procedure might remove one difficulty, it would not therefore help to solve the ultimate question of the differences betv/een Iraq and Koweit, I should be glad to have your views on our suggested line of action in due course.

So far as I can discover all discussions prior , to 1941 were conducted on the basis that if the port weref rfy- . built at Um Qasr it would be in Iraq, and if this is so /cMvj* the Prime Minister's stand is comprehensible. He has also a strong argument in that the definition of the ‘ frontier proposed in 1940 to Irani Government indubitably gives the present maritime site to Iraq (see my telegram 1 Tour of 1942). If we now cast doubt on this point, the boundary question (which it is desired to avoid raising during the war) will become a major issue which is likely . seriously to disturb our relations with Iraqi Government, y; In the circumstances I would urge the matter be left in abeyance, more particularly as the military authorities have now decided, barring unforeseen developments, it will not be necessary to bring the port into use. 4.

To - The Hbn v ble the Political Resident ) I in the Persian Oulf, Bushire. i — I have the honour to refer to Baghdad despatch No.290 dated October 13th, 1942. ency the British Ambassador in Iraq and the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at which I was priv6- liged to be present when the whole question of Umm tasr was discussed the extent to which the Basra Port Directorate would be concerned in the developement of the new port at ULm ^asr was examined and in reply to my stating my suspicion that the Basra Port Directorate would endeavour to obtain control of the port and later make use of what would be merely a war time expedient as a potent argument when the territorial claims of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Iraq Government in the Umm Q,asr area were eventually investigated and my advocating the total exclusion of the Basra Port Directorate from any thing bo do with Umm Oasr Port His Excellency stated that he had discussed the question with the late Sir John Ward who, far from heving any desire to obtain control of the port, waa, if anything, reluctant to add to his already large commitments and had no wish to have any connection with the management of the port though he would, no doubt, be willing to give such assistance as was possible in tiie piloting of vessels and the lighting and buoying of the channel in the Khor Abdullah. Sir 2. In February this year at a meeting between His Excell'It was agreed at this meeting that the Basra Port Directorate should have as little as possible to do v/ith the Port and that their activities should be limited to Pilotage, Lighting and Buoying. It is therefore difficult to understand Thompson’s statement in paragraph 2 of his des patch under reference that 'it was evident that the Amy would be dependent on the good offices of the Port of Basra for the performance of the services of lonservoncy Conservancy has but one meaning in connection with maritime matters and that is the Commission oT Board controlling a port. MlA * 2. The sequence of events leading to the present situat ion is interesting. The Umm ^asr project has been under consideration for some years ; and the files of this Agency contain copies of very illuminating corresoondence on the question,and on the Iraq fJovernment*s hopes and fears in this connection. In April of tnis year the late Sir John Ward became Director General of Iraqi Ports and Navigation, an appoint ment which caused comment here (see paragraph 129 of my Intelligence Summary No.T^of 1942) as the ports of Iraq are not so numerous and so important that the creation of such a post seemed justifiable. Some time prior to the 12th of June this year Sir John Ward forwarded to His Excellency the British Ambassador of a in Baghdad a draft/notification which he proposed to issue . with the approval of his Government in his capacity as Director General of Ports and Navigation, levying certain cnarges on shipping using the port of TJmm qasr and the approaches thereto. The reasons which Sir John stated necess itated this action have oeen detailed in the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of Mr. Thompson’s despatch. His Excellency was fully/fully aware how vitally are the interests of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait concerned in the Umm Qasr question and in the approaches to the port through the Khor Abdullah but did not apparently consider it advisable to acquaint the Government of India with this developement nor did he cause any intimation of his intention to permit the publication of the notification to be made to the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf who are immediately responsible for safeguarding British interests in the Persian Gulf and the interests of the Shaikh of Kuwait who enjoys the protection of His Majesty’s Government, It would seem that His Excellency acted entirely on his own responsibility when he caused Sir John Ward to be informed that 'he raised no objection' to publication and the notification was duly issued on the 12th of June. Of so little importance did it appear to the Embassy that it was more than two months before they sent a copy of the notification to this Agency by their Printed Letter No.50/61/42 dated August 25th. 4. Sir John Ward may have been perfectly straight for ward in his dealings with the Embassy and firmly believed the arguments he put forward to cause them to condone his action but it is possible that the Iraq Government were not so ingenuous. I It is well known that the Iraq Government have consid ered the Umm ^asr question very carefully and it is incon ceivable that they can be anything but fully aware of the interest which has been displayed in the boundary question by Sir John Ward himself, who was one of their own officials, by high British civil and military officials, and various Advisers and Intelligence organisations and there is little doubt that they are, at least unofficially, aware of our doubts regarding the exact position of the Iraq-Kuwait frontier/Tfr frontier at Uram 'asr 121 A oo rt at Uiu: asr xzay bo vital toj Soutjiigpp ;Iraq should any catastrophe ocour to render t '45 use of the Shatt al ? rab no longo.v a practicable proposition and the Iraq Oovernnent must do all they can, collect such evidence as is possible, and leave no stone, however mossy, unturned to substantiate their claim to the Umm Qasr area, the only possible site for a port* If Ubuii 'asr is not in Iraq Territory then there could be no question of the Iraqi Director General of Ports and Navig ation legally levying dues on vessels using the port and such fees as were chargeable on vessels using the approaches to the port could only be imposed by agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait who has equal rights withthe Iraq Government in the Khor Abdullah* No one would believe that the British Embassy were not also aware of uhe legal position which is not partic ularly abstruse and is more a matter of common sense than juristic nicety, and should they approve or 'relse no object ion^ to the notification planned by the Iraq Oovermrient it could be argued with considerable force that His Hajesty , s Representative had no doubt that the Iraq Government were act ing within their legal rights, in other words that the port was without doubt in Iraq Territory. The draft is produced the Director General discourses on the reasonableness of his suggestions with his usual in fectious energy and emphasises his desire not to complicate any territorial issues, and exercises his undoubted powers of persuasion with the result ^hat the Embassy are convinced of the disinterestedness of his motives and the notification is published without opposition from their ; in foot with their tacit concurrence and the Iraq Government are in possession of another weapon with which to fight the Timm lasr battle*! ■ v? •Au 4 s k-x^v, , 7L^ v { ^ *K £ fc ^*-w *| C^Ctv^^ ** -V^ K^ ^ !

Thompson proposes to stage should he be V forced against his better Judgement to try and repair the damage already done will have any satisfactory result. The Iraqis are much better actors and more smilled in oriental diplomacy than we can ever hope to be for they are not handicapped by conscience and would view our amateurish efforts with the contempt they deserve. The situation is one which calls for clear thinking end plain speaking and the Iraq Government should be told that on mature consideration His Majesty^ Government have decided that they are not prepared to acquiese in tlieir levying fees on the approaches to Iftnm Qasr as they do not lie solely within their frontiers, nor may fees be levied by them at Uinm r 0 asr as the territorial situation of the port is still in doubt, that it is fully realised that the Basra Port Directorate are entitled to remuneration for the pilot age, buoying, and other services being rendered by them at Urom Q.asr and that it is proposed that the Military Adminis tration of the Uam ^asr Area should levy fees on the same scale as that mentioned in the Iraq Government Notification published on the 12th of June, the amounts received being credited to the Basra Port Directorate. Further that His 1 sjesty’s Government consider that as the notification in question is improper and unnecessary it should be cancelled forthwith. I have no doubt that the Embassy and the British Military Authorities in Iraq will be able to ensure that work on the port will be in no way affected by speak ing to the Iraq Government. I have ohe honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.Please see Foreign Gif ice letter of JJarch 11th and the draft telegram enclosed therewith# Paragraph 1(a) oi the draft adopts the s ugg estion made in paragraph 3 of our letter No. lixt# 870/43 of March 3rd; and paragraph 1 (h) adopts the suggestion to -which we agreed in paragraph 2 of that letter. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Cufice letter and paragraph 2 of the draft telegram deal with the question of the method of collection of the waterways dues, which is discussed in your note of February 23rd and subsequent notes below the draft telegram. You will see that we have failed to convince the Foreign Office, whose suggestion that these dues might be collected elsewhere than at Dm Qasr would surely be impracticable. Nevertheless this Dep artment considers that the question is not of sufficient importance to justify a continuance of this protracted correspondence; the important consideration surely is that the already excessive delay in talcing action at Bagdad should not be further prolonged. If you agree therefore we will inforai the Foreign Office orally that we concur in their draft. Possibly we might ask them to add a sentence at the end to ensure that oir K. Cornwallis keeps them informed of the action taken. ^ SUv-LV. /d OVuJ.-j- vn 'c,'V^ . to . i) M ll * \ tff'/L 1 *^ ‘T.; ■ r y f, ^ v©^ J *' . , ,t f^U- •'I {L ^ ^ 3 ^. y ■ *: •; i «&lt;- ^ “ ' ^ ^ &amp; A ' /kf /l ; PCKEISU OFFICE, S.W.l. ■“ - 11th March, 1940. 1228 !

In paragraph 4 of your letter you deal with the method of collecting the dues for the use of the waterway. In our view, paragraph 2 of the written communication to the Iraqi Government as now drafted fully reserves the Sheikh's rights. It explains why the Port of Basra authorities are being allowed to collect dues in. respect of a waterway part of which belongs to Koweit, and in view of its terms we do not think that the Iraqi Government could base any claims prejudicial to the Sheikh's rights on the fact that the port authorities are allowed to collect these dues, even if, for reasons of convenience, they collect the dues at Um Qasr itself.

Moreover, if paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Port of Basra notification are not to be cancelled, we see no advantage in having the dues collected by the military authorities rather than by the Port.

(Aeto iyvv^ I^kJjl &lt;^n • A While I agree that the position is not satisfactory and that we might come out more strongly in support of Colonel Prior's view in regard to the collection of ( waterv/ay dues, I do not thinlc that it is correct to say that the same arguments apply as regard the collection of dues at Um Qasr in respect of the matters dealt with in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notification .' 1 In the first place the notification only states the fact that dues will be charged on the scales laid down and makes no reference to where the dues shall be collected. It is only a matter of adirdnistrative convenience that they should be collected at Um Qasr. In the second place paragraph 2 of the draft note makes it quite clear that the Iraq Directorate G-eneral of Ports and Navigations are performing services in the waterway at the request of the British milita ry a uthoriti es and are accordingly entitled to recover charges in respect of such services. For these reasons it seems to me incorrect to say, as you propose in your amendment, that the Iraqis may draw an inference^ prejudicial to the Shaik's position^that we admit jurisdiction on the part of the Iraq Government to legislate for the collection of dues in Um gas r in respect of services performed elsewhere, merely because we allow paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notification to stand. I would therefore rush that paragraph 4 , after the first two sentences should read as follows ’’Prior does not explain his reasons for this view but the point does seem to us of some Importance^more . especiall y now that there is to be so little in the way of di-co^wlr^ )—~~explici1&gt;\P«coi ; a.iei^iati&amp;n of the Shailjl’s interest in the port In his telegram No. 126 Cornwallis argues that because the whole notification cannot be cancelled the Army cannot collect the waterways dues. We do not altogether follow this t since the notification does not specify by whom the dues shall be collected and it would , seem to be possible for the collection of these dues as prescribed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notificationI do not feel at all happy about paragraph 4 of this draft. As you say, we shall now get nothing (or practically nothing) on written record to protect the Shaikh’s position in the port of Um Qasr itself. I suppose we raust accept this. One result is to remove the objection that was raised against the suggestion that we nd^it try to arrange orally for the cancellation of the whole notification. It seems clear, however, that Sir K. Cornwallis would not be prepared to try for this, and again I suppose we must accept the position. But Sir K. Cornwallis 1 deduction that ’hence Army cannot collect water-way dues* is another matter, and I should be inclined to come out much more strongly in support of Colonel Prior* s view. The whole of this discussion is to my mind still very much confused by the running together of the questions ( 1 ) who should perform various services in the different areas, and ( 2 ) who should fix the dues for the various services respectively, and authorise their collection at Um Qasr , (3) who should actually collect the dues there. Paragraph 3 of the draft letter takes the point as regards the services mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Notification that it is a question not only by whom the services are performed, but also within whose Jurisdiction they are performed and dues levied; W,Mr. Baxter refers to the possible inference from the proposed Note to the Iraq Government that *we saw no reason to object to the collection of dues by the Iraqi authorities at the port of Um Qasr itself*. Apparently he is thinking only of the collection of dues for services performed within the port itself. But surely the same arguments apply as regards the collection of dues at Um Qasr in respect of the matters dealt with in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Notification? And, if these paragraphs are to remain in being, nothing could do more to strengthen the possible inference that the Iraq Government have Jurisdiction in Um Qasr than to have the dues collected at Um Qasr by the Basra Port Authority themselves in their own right under the Notification? On the other hand, it would go at ary rate a long way to negative the inference in question to have the dues collected by the military authorities and handed over to the Basra Port Authority (or possibly, though this would be less satisfactory/I satisfactory, collected Ky a Basra Port Officer explicitly- authorised 'by the military authorities.) It would be still better, in ny view, that the military authorities should themselves issue notifications covering the collection of All the dues. But I daresay it is undesirable to pursue this. I I should be inclined accordingly to amend the draft letter on the lines I have suggested in pencil - or possibly seme oral discussion with the Foreign Office would be desirable. I understand that the Foreign Office legal advisers have been in touch with .this discussion, and possibly they do not look on the matter in the same light as I do.

Gp.685 (103(18) Wt.l3671/P159 1,000 5/39 „ „MINUTE These papers, which were last submitted at Ext.7078/42, deal with the question of safeguarding the riejits of the Shaikh of Koweit in regard to the proposed port at Urn Qasr, which is being constructed by the^ritish military authorities who are also, with the agreementacquiescence of the Shaikh and the Iraqi Government, administering the Jbort area for the duration of the war. It will be remembered that objection has been taken to an Iraqi Government notification (copy at Bxt.5066/42) levying dues on shipping using the port and its approaches, on the ground )rf i,: /that the Iraqis have no right to legislate^ either for the port ^/itselfrighte in disputed territory, or for its approaches, 'part of which are Koweit territorial waters. 2. There has been considerable discussion of the question of the best method of approaching the Iraqi Government in order to secure the cancellation of the notification in whole or part, or at least to obtain assurances that nothing done under it will prejudice the Shaikh* s ri^its. The procedure now proposed is described in Bagdad telegrams No. 126 and No. 148, read with Foreign Office letter of February 18th (all immediately below the draft); and it may be summarised as follows ev 1% h isl/***. ^ , r fl r* tL,' c*. fl&lt;A . (&amp;) the military authorities would reach provisional agreement with the Basra Port Directorate on the question of what further notifications would need to be issued by either parly. (b) Sir K. Cornwallis would inform the Prime Minister^that the services at the port itself, for which dues are charged under paragraph 3 of the notification, are in fact being performed by the British military authorities; that this paragraph is therefore ^^fA^fyUaJS- ( »**!*lie«L, and that the military authorities were approaching the Port Director for its cancellation as a matter of form. (c) After the cancellation of paragraph 3&gt; Sir K. Cornwallis would address a Note to the Iraqi Government emphasising that the performance of the services enumerated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notification (i.e. those relating to the approaches to the Port) and the levy of charges for these services, in no way prejudice the rights of the Shaikh of Koweit in that part of the water which belongs to Koweit. 3. This question of how best to approach the Iraqi Government has been discussed at such length that it is desirable if possible to reach agreement without further delay. On the other hand it is doubtful whether the proposals produced by Sir K. Cornwallis and the Foreign Office go far enough in the direction of safeguarding the Shaikh* s rights. The part of the notification which is open to the greatest objection from this point of view is paragraph 3, which may be taken to imply that the Iraqi Government have the right to legislate for the whole of the port area. Sir K. Cornwallis proposes to arrange for the cancellation of this paragraph on the ground, not that it may prejudice the claims of Koweit to disputed territory on its frontier, but simply that it does not correspond to facts, viz that the services which it aiumerates are performed not by the Basra Port Directorate but by the military authorities. It is further proposed that the Note to the Iraqi Government should make no mention of paragraph 3 (beyond the passing reference to its cancellation proposed in the Foreign Office letter), or of the interest of Koweit in the port area. It seems unwise to propose further amendments to the draft Note; but there should be no objection to Sir K. Cornwallis including in his oral coninunication to the Prime Minister a statement such as that propounded in the first paragraph of his telegram No.1262 of December 18th, where he suggested that it should be embodied in the written comm mica t ion. This would at least imply that the Shaikh has an interest in the port area and nob merely in the territorial waters. 4* There remains the question of who is to collect the dues for the services rendered by the Basra Port Directorate in the approaches to the Port.^ These will be levied by virtue of paragraphs 1 and 2 of UZ notification. The Foreign Office have suggested that, since these dues will/wiU te levied when the vessel reaches the Port of dm Qasr, they can he collected hy the militaiy authorities and handed over to the Port of Basra, This view has been supported ty the Political Resident - very strongly in his latest telegram,No*324 of January 28th* On the other hand Sir K* Cornwallis first of all stated that the military authorities would find it more convenient for the collection to he undertaken hy the Basra Port Directorate; and he now argues that since n for various reasons' the cancellation of the whole notification would he impracticable, the military authorities cannot collect the waterwaydues. It is not clear that the fact that the ndlitary authorities would not he responsible for the notification under which the dues were levied would necessarily preclude their collecting them and handing them over to Basra Port, But, while such an arrangement would certainly he preferable frctn our point of view, it is doubtful whether the matter hes the iraportantance which Col, Prior gives to it. As the 0^2^part of the draft shows,if the Shaikh were to raise this point, the Political authorities would he able to make quite a convincing reply, though for this purpose it would he desirable for them to he able to show the Shaikh the Note to the Iraqi Government, The draft asks whether the Foreign Office wouldsee any objection to this being done* 2*.

You will have seen the Political Resident* s telegram No. 324 of January 28th, in which he says that it is essential for these dues to be collected by the militaiy authorities administering the port. Prior does not explain his reasons for this viewjbut the point does seem to us to be of some importance, more especially now that there is to be so little in the way of explicit recognition of the Sheikh* s interest in the port itself. We feel that the collection of these dues by the Basra Port Directorate at Um ^asr, presumably on the sole legal authority of paras. 1 and 2 of the notification, might, in spite of what is to be said in para. 2 of Cornwallis* draft note, give rise to the inference that the Iraqi Government can exercise some jurisdiction in the port area. In his telegram No. 126 Cornwallis argues that because the v/hole notification cannot be cancelled^the waterways dues. But infact the notification does not specify where or by whom these dues shall be collected. If it were practicable to arrange for the cancellation of the whole notification, the militaiy authorities would be /ableable to issue a fresh notification eiapowering the collection at Um ^asr of dues relating to the use of the wateivay as well as the port itself*_ If, however, we must accept Cornwallis* view that this is not practicable, we should much prefer that, in order to prevent the Iraqi Govemraent from drawing the inference described above, the collection of the dues prescribed in paras, 1 and 2 of the notification should be undertaken by the Anry, who would hand over the proceeds to the j^raqi OuveTiiiiiciib, R.ft f -- «&gt; .^ear Iiavilui3a f | «,L 100 i*1UH la« QF/ICS, 26th &gt;tftjrui.ry # 194^. i^/pg^s ^ FEB 194?

Cornwallis evidently thinks that it will be best to concentrate at this stage upon securing our minimum requirements, and not complicate matters by trying to get something on record about the land frontier. He may well be right-about this. On the assumption that he will be able to arrange for the cancellation of paragraph 3 of the Notification, as he suggests, before he takes up the question of paragraphs 1 and 2 with the Iraqi Government officially, we see no harm in the omission of any explicit mention in his note of paragraph 3. But, if we are to be on the safe side, it seems to us desirable that we should make sure that the Iraqis cannot at a later date say that, although we had reserved the Sheikh’s rights in regard to the first two paragraphs of the Notification, we had said nothing about paragraph 3: that the cancellation of this paragraph before we v/rote to them had no bearing on the subject: and that it could therefore be concluded that at least when the Note was written we saw no reason to object to the collection of dues by the Iraqi authorities at the port of Um Qasr itself. It seems to us therefore that if we wish to avoid any explicit mention of paragraph 3&gt; we should cover ourselves by adding in the first paragraph of the proposed Note the words ’’as amended by the Notification No. . . . , of . . • .”, i.e. the Notification cancelling paragraph 3* \ R.T.Peel, Esq.., C.B.E. , M.C. , India Office.IH3 Under Loypher].

Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this notification lay down certain scales of dues and pilotage charges for vessels using waterways leading to port of Umm Qasr. In these waters which are partly Iraqi and partly Koweiti the Iraq Directorate-General of Ports and Navigation are at the request of the British military authorities performing services of pilotage, dredging, lighting and buoying and it is recognised that they are entitled to recover charges in respect of such services.

To meet local consid erations the following would therefore be the most satisfactory course' if you approve. 1. Military authorities and port director to.reach provisional agreement unofficially as to what notifications they should respectively issue, so that the Army shall collect dues in respect of harbour services which they themselves perform and which are at present listed in paragraph 3 of existing Iraqi notification. 2. As soon as this has been done I would tell the Prime Minister that since Urn Qasr is military port, Army are running it entirely themselves but that at their request port director is undertaking water-way services. I would add that this means that Army should collect dues in respect of services covered by paragraph 3 of Iraqi notification and that they would therefore be issuing notification accordingly them selves. I would then say my attention had been f? grp. omtd. ?drawn to] paragraph 3 of an existing notification issued by port ox Basra which purported to over-collect dues on certain scale for their services. Prime Minister would appreciate that this paragraph was inappropriate in the circumstances. Military authorities were therefore approaching port director for its cancellation as a matter of form. I would also point out to the Prime Minister that since the military were in any case performing all these services there was no financial aspect involved and ask him to explain the matter accordingly to the Minister of Communications and Works in order that this administrative act could go through without assuming unnecessary status of Cabinet issue. ii Hi ^ iZ CO (g; G 2 3. Port director would then submit to his Minister notification (in terms previously agreed with us and the Army) cancelling the offending paragraph. 4.

Two-further courses seem open to us:- (a) to proceed as originally proposed discussed ^ (&gt;••*— * above); and ' (b) to arrange orally for the cancellation of the whole notification. In the latter case it would be necessary^either for the Port of Basra or for the military authorities to issue a new notification authorising the collection of dues on vessels using the waterway, just as it will be necessary for the military authorities to issue a notification prescribing the charges to be levied in the Port area, if it is decided to levy charges there. If our military authorities are prepared to accept the additional work involved in collecting the dues and passing on the sums collected to the Port of Basra in payment of their services, $A/Y W/y\ « I should prefer notification to be - tsaiied. by them: and* the fact that they were prepared to collect the dues could be given to.the Iraqi Government as justification for our request that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Port of Basra notification should be ^ cancelled. __ 4. Any of these three alternatives would seem to me adequa tely to met t our immediate requirement, which it to see that the rights of the. Sheikh are not prejudiced by the Port of Basra notification. I realise that the adoption of course (b) above might minimise the chances of friction with the Iraqi Government now, but I am not sure that it might not bewell to put something to them in writing without further delay which would show, at least by inference, that part of the Port area is in Koweit. I fear that if we continue to keep any mention of this fact off the record, we may make things even more difficult for ourselves than they will in any case be when the time comes for reaching a definite settlement of this question after the war, 4. Please telegraph your views on the three alternatives outlined above, so that the matter can be considered further.MIITUi 1 E It will 'be remembered that objection lias been taken to ah.Iraqi G-ovemment notification (copy at Ext. 5066 / 42 ) levying dues on shipping using the Port of Um Qasr and its approaches, on the O rouna$ tha.t the Iraqis have no right to legislate either for the Port itself, which lies in disputed territory, or for its approachesj part of which ane Koweit territorial waters. It was felt that a notiiication of this kind should have been issued by the military authorities who, with the agreement or acquiescence of the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, are administering the Port area for the duration of the war, * 2. The submission at Ext. 6742/42 dealt with a line of action which had been agreed at an interdepartmental meeting. In accordance with this. Sir K. Cornwallis was instructed, in Foreign Office telegrams Nos. 1126 and 112? of December 10th, to address tsw^note to the Iraqi Government, (a) asking that paragraph 3 of the notification, which prescribes charges for the use of the Port, should be cancelled; (b) putting it on record that the performance by the Basra Port Directorate of certain speciiied services in the approaches to the Port was without prejudice to the rights of the Sheikh in Koweit territorial waters. 3. In nis telegram ho. 1262 of December 18th Sir K. Cornwallis has raised various points with regard to these instructions. We have also received a telegramjf^TU/^fibouC. No.T/803 of December 23 rd anoAletter frdm the Foreign Office, both commenting on the Bagdad telegram. The points at issue are as follows:- « (i) Sir K. Cornwallis argues that it would be misleading to include in the draft note a passage to the effect tha.t the Iraqi Government had agreed to^tne administration of the Port area by the British military authorities while the war lasts, since in fact they have never gone so far as to give their written agreement to this. He therefore proposes the alternative formula in pa^.. 1 of his telegram. It is unsatisfactory that there snould be .my^written record of the Iraqi Government*s agreement, but in the circumstances the amendment proposed seems as good as any that could be devised. Both the Political Resident and the Foreign Office are prepared to acquiesce in it. Having proposed this amendment, however. Sir K. Cornwallis proceeds to recconend the cancellation of the entire paragraph to which it relates. His rea.son for this is that the Prime Minister had asked him ’’not to put any tiling official on paper** about the Portland he would therefore prefer to try and secure the cancellaation of paragraph 3 by means of unofficial representations. As the Foreign Office point out, it is not easy to see from paragraph 2 of his telegram what procedure he has in mind. The Foreign Office argue that there are two possible courses (a) to ahead as originally proposed, but with a slight modification in the written coinmumca.tion. This would involve overruling Sir K. Cornwallis'objection to a written request for the cancellation of paragraph 3. We must assume therefore that it would increase the 01 dij. ficulties with the Iraqi Government, and of a refusal by them to accede to our wishes, (b) to arrange orally for the cancellation of the whole notification. The Foreign Office draw attention to the danger of keeping our negotiations with the Iraqis entirely on verbal footing, and suggest that some written communication will be necessary. In these circumstances the Foreign Office propose that, before taking a final decision on this question of procedure,they should explain the position as they see it fully to Sir K. Cornwallis and obtain his views. It is suggested that we may agree to this. At the same time, this Department considers that there is a third possible course of action, described in paragraph 3 of the draft below, which would not be open to the disadvantages of the other two, and which may well be what Sir K. Cornwallis envisages. A telephone conversation with the Foreign Office has revealed that this solution had not occurred to them and that they are prepared to consider it. It is accordingly proposed to suggest to them that their telegram to Bagdad should be so drafted as to indicate this course as a possible alternative to the other two which may well be preferable to either of them.('Ot) As regards the collection of dues for the services rendered by the Basra Port Directorate in the approaches to Um Qasr,Sir K* Cormrallis says that the military authorities would prefer that the Port Directorate, and not they themselves, should do this . 1 He adds, however, that it might be possible to arrange for collection by the military- authorities. Both the Foreign Office and the Political Resident prefer this latter alternative 9 even at the cost of some inconvenience to the military. We may readily agree with them.

We also agree that in the circumstances the amendment proposed in paragraph 1 of Cornwallis' telegram \y 2, You will by now have seen the Political iff ice.

In this he acquiesces in what is said inmay be accepted. 3, While we, like yoi^ find'difficulty in undentandin^ paragraph 2 of porrovallis* telegram,’ it occurs to us that* he-may be oontomplating action somewhat'oh the following lines. He would first of all speak: to Nuri with a view to arranging unofficially for the cancellation of paragraph 3 of the not if ica,ti on 0 If he were successful/, he would address to the Iraqi' Government a note, paragraphs 1 and 3 of which would foj^^d^ft in Foreign Office telegram No, 1127, with «_ 5ucA cl 4 perhaps the addition to paragraph 1 of -the- forrnula^proposed in the 1st paragraph of Cornwallis’ telegram. Paragraph 2, however, would simply take note of the fact that paragraph 3 of the notification had been cancelled. 4. Whether or not this course is in sffact what Cornwallis has in mind, it seems to us to have much to recommend it* The objects which it would be designed to secure are the same as those envisaged in Foreign Office telegrams Nos, 1126 and 1127* At the same time, not only would it meet Cornwallis’ objection to a written request for the cancellation of paragraph 3, but it would also avoid frhe dr.ng»g of leaving eur ^n &lt;Kal the Iraa^is on/entirely voJtoiil footing, 5. Tfiilu thcreforo- \nle agree that Cornwallis should be consulted further before any final decision is taJcen with regard/ with»0| ^ s FOREIGN OFFICE, 8 .W.I. 24th Decemher, 1942. You will already have seen a copy of Bagdad telegram Vovp fi No. 1262 of the 18th Decemb er. to the Foreign Office about Um cfesr. The conversation with Nuri reported in Bagdad telegram No. 55 7 of the 4t h April, (our reference number E '2119/134/93 of the 5th April T) is not the only occasion on which the Ambassador has raised the question of Urn Qasr with the Iraqis. He told us in his telegram No. 85B of the 1st August, 1941 (our reference E 4360/26B7/ l 93 of the 5th August, 1941) that he had spoken to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs on the lines which it had been agreed should be used both with the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Koweit,*and he reported that Ali Jaudat seemed to think that the Iraqi Government would welcome the step. IHowever, as nothing has been put to the Iraqi Government I so far in writing, we agree that the wording of paragraph 2 of the draft note in our telegr a m No. 1127 of the 10th December, to Bagdad will have to be slightly modified, if indeed a written communication is to be put in at all. The re-draft proposed by Cornwallis seems all right to us. It brings out what we take to be the essential point, that the Sheikh is concerned in the Port area as well as the Iraqi Government. We do not altogether understand paragraph 2 of Cornwallis’s telegram. It is clear that he wants us to omit paragraph 2 of the draft note, leaving it to him to arrange/ R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C., India Office.arrange orally for the cancellation of paragraph 3 of the notification. But apparently he contemplates sending in a written communication on the lines of paragraphs 1 and 3 of the draft note. It seems to us that if we put anything in writing to the Iraqi Government aBout the notification, we must deal with its paragraph 3. Otherwise, it would look from the records as though we saw no objection to that paragraph, whereas it is in fact the most objectionable from our point of view. It seems to us, therefore, that we have a choice between two courses: (a) to go ahead as originally proposed, but with a slight modification in the written comnunication, and (b) to arrange orally for the cancellation of the whole notification. In the latter case, it would presumably be necessary either for the Port of Basra or for the military authorities to issue a new notification authorising the collection of dues on vessels using the waterway, just as it will be necessary for the military authorities to issue a notification prescribing the charges to be levied in the Port area, if it is decided to levy charges there at all. The issue of the notification, or rather the collection of dues which this would entail, will no doubt involve our military authorities in some additional work and we quite understand that they may regard this as a nuisance. Nevertheless, if we are to go to the length of getting the Iraqi Government to withdraw the whole notification, we think that it would be best for the new notification about the collection of dues in the waterway to be issued by the military authorities, who could then pass on the suras collected to the Port of Basra in payment of their services. /EitherEither of these alternatives would seem to us adequately to meet our immediate requirement, which is to see that the rights of the Sheikh are not prejudiced 'by the Port of Basra notification, and we do not think that there is very much to choose 'between them on that score. Course (b) might be easier to put across the Iraqi Government, but we are not at all sure that we might not be well- advised to put something to them in writing, without further delay, which would show, at least by inference, that part of the Port area is in Kov/eit, even though this may lead to a little unpleasantness. If we continue to keep any mention of that fact off the record, we may make things even more difficult for ourselves than they will be in any case when the time comes for clearing this business up after the war. It is a question of weighing one sort of advantage against another and, if you agree, we might explain the position fully to the anbassy as we see it and obtain their views before taking any final decision.

The point has never been put in writing o Iraqi Government. I told the Prime Minister privately of oujr intention and he raised no objection (see paragraph 5 °f my m'S telegram No. 357).

When I spoke to him last April, the Prime Minister asked me not to put anything official on paper, and I would much prefer if you will agree that I should approach him verbally in the first instance and endeavour to arrange unofficially tne cancellation of paragraph 3 of notification.

Since (by agreement with the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Koweit; the port area&gt;of Urn Qasr is to:be administered for the duration of the war by the British military authorities, paragraph. 5 of the Port Director's notification seems entirely inappropriate. So long as a request for its cancellation is put-forward for this reason alone there seems no valid cause why the Iraqi Government should object, and I think that we must ask them to take this step, since otherwise I fear that the Sheikh’s rights in any part of the port area would be prejudiced. 2; Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notification seem unobjectionable but I think it desirable that we should put it on record that the fact that the Port of Basra authorities are by agreement performing certain services in the approaches to Urn Qasr and levying charges in respect of these services, is without prejudice to the rights o the Sheikh. The Iraqi Government cannot dispute the fact that half the waterway leading at least part of the way up to Jm C&amp;sr from the sea is Koweiti, so that for us to reserve the Sheikh s rights should not give rise to controversy. 3. I presume that in fact the dues under paragraphs 1 and 2 will he levied when the vessel reaches the port of Urn Qasr ana 'that they will be collected by the military authorities and hande over to the Port of Basra. The military authorities are ionsidering whether they will levy dues for wWfage_and wharf services to ship and cargo at Urn Qasr. If they decide to do so they will presumably issue an appropriate notice. 4. I shall be glad therefore if you will address to the Iraqi Government a communication on the lines of my immediately following telegram. 5.

It will 'be remembered that we recently proposed to the Foreign Office that a meeting should be held to discuss the Iraqi Government notification levying dues on shipping using the Port of Um Qasr and its approaches (see Ext. 621 yV). A meeting was held this morning and was attended by representatives of the Foreign Office, the War Office, the Ministry of flax Transport, Mr. Peel and myself. As a basis for discussion the Foreign Office produced two draft telegrams to Bagdad, which will be found below. ThCsCseemed to meet in substance the views stressed by the Government of India and the Political Resident and in this Office. I hey ^ course involve the abandonment of Absolution proposed in paragraph five of the Political Resident*s telegram No.2301 of November 10th; but in our letter to the Foreign % 0ffice of November 26th at Ext.6212^/42, we expressed doubt as to the of this solution. In these circumstances we had no difficulty iA° accepting the two telegrams, subject to a number of amendments of secondary importance which are indicated on the copies below. With regard to the concluding paragraph of the first draft, we have of course not yet reached agreement with the Foreign Office on the correct interpretation of existing definitions of the Koweit - Iraq Frontier and in particular with regard tpretention or abandonmsnt of the 1940 formila. We have never argued out these quest ions with the Foreign Office,though we have exchanged a number of letters with them; but the probability is that our differences cannot be resolved without a reference to the Law Officers of the Crown. In the meantime there seems no alternative for us but to accept the position described in the paragraph in question. It was agreed at the meeting that we should send a telegram to the Political Resident referring to the two Foreign Office telegrams ( which will be repeated to him, to the Government of India and to Koweit); and adding that, since no decision has been reached on the question whether the 1943 definition can be abandoned he should instruct the Political Agent at Koweit to avoid giving the Sheikh any reason to believe that H.M.G. do not still stand Ty this fornnlfl.( compare the sentence with which it was originally Afcoposed to end the first Foreign Office draft.) A draft telegram on these lines, which it is hoped to issue more or less simultaneously with the Foreign Office telegrams, is submitted.

For the present purpose there is no need to recapitulate the points at issue in the dispute regarding the location of the port of Um Qasr in relation to the Koweit-Iraq frontier, nor those in the controversy between this Office and the Foreign Office on what should be said to the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Koweit about our post war plans for the port. No steps have been taken towards the settlement of these questions since our letter to the Foreign Office of June 16th last (see the submission flagged at Ext. 2359 / 42 ). Meanwhile, with the agreement of the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh, the construction of the port and the administration of the port area remain in the hands of the British Military Authorities for the duration of the war. In September, however, we received copies of telegrams (Ext.494-1 and 4998/42) from the Government of India and the Political Resident regarding an Iraqi Government Notification (copy at Ext.5066/42) levying certain specified dues upon vessels using Um Qasr port and its approaches. Both the Government of India and the Political Resident asked H.M. Ambassador at Bagdad to arrange for the Notification to be cancelled, on the ground that it ran counter to the agreed arrangements for the administration of the port by the British Military Authorities while the .var lasts. In so doing the Political Resident (see his Express Letter at Ext.5220/42) took exception not only to the provision in the Notification levying charges at the port itself, but also to paragraphs 1 and 2 which, by prescribing charges on vessels approaching the port, appeared to him to ignore Koweit’s admitted rights in the Khor Abdulla. Tnough Colonel Hay absolved the Iraqi Government (correctly, as it appears) from having instigated the Notification with a view to furthering their territorial ambitions in the future, he felt that they might some day find it a useful weapon to support extravagant claims of this nature. He also anticipated that the Sheikh of Koweit, when he became aware of the Notification might make a justifiable protest. ^ After discussing the question with the Persia-Iraq Command, the Charge d'Affaires at Bagdad has given his views in a despatch dated October 13th. Paragraph 2 of this despatch describes how the Notification was issued as a result of discussions between the Military Authorities and the late Sir John Ward, who held the post of Director-General of Ports and Navigation under the Iraqi Government. Mr. Thompson proceeds to argue that the Notification was little more than a formality, that it cannot be held to prejudice H.M.G*s. freedom of action in the frontier dispute, and that to cnallenge the right of the Iraqi Government to^issue^it would only serve to arouse their suspicions and might impair their co-operation in the development of the port. He accordingly recommends that nothing should be said to the Iraqis at present. If, however, H.M.G. should decide that some communication must be made, he suggests that the Sheikh of Koweit should be instigated to ask the Iraqi Government to confirm that the Notification had been made without prejudice to any ultimate decision regarding the demarcation of the frontier and that it was merely issued as a matter of administrative convenience to permit the Director-General of Ports to carry out functions necessary to meet the requirements of the British Forces.” Mr. Thompson would present the Sheikh* s request to the Iraqi Government, if necessary drawing attention to its reasonableness. Mr. Thompson adds that paragraph 3 of the Notification, prescribing charges for services rendered in the port itself, is already a dead letter since the Military Authorities are themselves performing these services, ^his however, does not apply to the services enumerated in paragraphs 1 and 2, ”/hich , cannot conveniently be undertaken by the military. The Political Resident* s telegram No.2301 of November 10th vigorously contests 11*. Thompson’s views and urges that the Sheikh’s rights should be ully protected. He does not agree that the proposed communication to the Iraqi Government should be made on behalf of the Sheikh, but recommends instead .at ^e should send them a brief note quoting the Notification 'which was issued by Sir John Ward on behalf of the Military Authorities regarding Um Qasr' and mentioning that paragraph 3 will no longer have any force as the Military Authorities/Authorities are administering the port themselves. The Government of India's- telegram No.9158 of November 16th supports the Poliiacal Resident's contention that Koweit's interests must be fully safeguarded, without specifically endorsing the method^ proposed. There is no doubt that we must support the line taken by the Government of India and the Political Resident. On the question of the method to be adopted, we may agree with the Political Resident that any communication to the Iraqis should come from H.M.G. themselves and not be made on behalf of the Sheikh. The point of the formula recommended by Colonel Prior doubtless resides in the phrase ”on behalf of the Military Authorities'. He evidently considers that while a frontal attack would be futile since it would not produce a satisfactory acknowledgment from the Iraqis, their acknowledgment of a communication containing this phrase would be sufficient to forestall any future attempt on their part to use the Notification in support of their territorial claims. It is open to question whether the formula suggested would in fact have this effect, and would not rather imply recognition on our part that the Iraqi Government were within their rights in making the Notification. It might be preferable for the proposed communication to be on the lines proposed by Mr. Thompson, provided that it^CftCmade direct by H.LI.G. on their own behalf and not on that of the Sheikh. It is understood that the Foreign Office are inclined to sympathise with our anxiety that the Notification should not prejudice the Sheikh's interests, and that they would like to discuss with us how best this can be done. Mr. Lock, the Ministry of War Transport's Representative at Basra^is now in this country; and though he is concerned with shipping control and not with port administration he might be able to offer useful advice on the administrative requirements of the new port. It is therefore desirable that the meeting should be held before Mr. Lock leaves this countryi 'flu. In these circumstances a draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted supporting the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident and suggesting a meeting to discuss ways and means.This is a very troublesome case. The new port is in a disputed area between Iraq and Koweit. The Embassy in Bagdad holds that the port is in Iraq while the Persian Gulf political I authorities claim that part^if not the whole of, it is in Koweit. In any case, the Khor Abdullah, which is a channel leading up to the port, is definitely the boundary line between Iraq and Koweit, so that the question of the use of Kowei^s territorial waters is involved. In order to avoid undesirable controversy in wartime it was arranged with the agreement both of the Government of Iraq and the Sheikh of Koweit that the port should be constructed by and entirely administered by the British military authorities during the war, and we have so far avoided any commitment as to the future of the port after the war. We know, however, that the Iraqi Government had for some time been planning the construction of a port in this area, and were expecting H.M.G* to put pressure on the Sheikh of Koweit to give them territorial concessions for the purpose. They no doubt now anticipate that the port will be handed over to them as a going concern at the end of the war. The Sheikh on his side is extremely apprehensive and wanted us to promise to demolish the port after the war rather than let it be handed over to the Iraqis, which he said would spell ruin for Koweit. : Against this background it will be seen that there was considerable Justification for Colonel Hay*s original protest (Ext.5220 last September) against the issue under the authority of the Iraqi Government of this Notification fixing dues and I charges for vessels navigating to Urn Qasr. It is only reasonble to apprehend that if the notification remains unchallenged it may at some future date be used by an Iraqi Government to support a claim for the ownership of the port, if not of the territorial waters of the Khor Abdullah as well. As Colonel Hay pointed out, the port has purposely been left as a neutral ground under a military administration, and in the circumstances that administration should be the sole authority entitled to issue a Notification of the kind in question. I am not impressed by Mr. Thompson’s despatch of 13th October, and I think we clearly ought to support the view of the/the Political Resident and the Government of India that something must be done to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh of Koweit. We may perhaps acquit Sir John Ward of any evil intent in this matter, though it must be remembered that he was the servant of the Iraq Government and was the originator before the war of the whole plan for an Iraqi port at Um Qasr, But in issuing this Notification no doubt all that he had in mind was to find a legal basis for the collection of port dues and from that point of view it was doubtless the simplest course to issue the Notification under the authority of the Iraq Government on the lines of what is done at Basra, But I think he or the Embassy at any rate should have appreciated the objections to such a course, and they should certainly have consulted the Political Resident before issue. The question of the best method of putting tilings right is a difficult one and if, as we understand, the P#0. are agreeable to a conference on the subject, I think this would be the best course, Mr, Thompson would rather leave things alone, but if he has to say anything he would prefer to do it ostensibly at the instance of the Sheikh, who would invite the Iraqi Government to confirm that the Notification in question had been issued without prejudice to the demarcation of the frontier. Colonel Prior objects to this on the grounds (a) that it is unreasonable to ask the Sheikh to act in this way, and (b) that it would be difficult to get the Iraqi Government to give the required confirmation, and if they did not the Sheikh's position would be seriously weakened, I am not altogether convinced by the first argument, though it is probably better where the Sheikh is concerned (especially in view of his health) to let sleeping dogs lie. It would hardly be possible to act in the Sheikh's y fa name without letting him know that we were doing it. The ^ second objection, however, seems to me to have very great^^ force. Colonel Prior's own suggestion hardly seems to gb ^ L far enough, though the point is I suppose,as Mr. Lumby a v c suggests, to place it on record that the Notification was . c , £ issued on behalf of the military authorities. ^ u c, ^ A possible course would be simply to inform the Iraqi Government that H.M.G's attention has been drawn to the Ad fact/r- 12^ fact that the issue of the Notification under the authority of the Iraqi Government was inappropriate in view oi the fact that the port is under the control of the military authorities, and that it should therefore be cancelled. n.mmm'WSSsmMK'] a3 © KEY. Mr# Peel aken to su PPOse it is clear that the charges in question are proposed &gt; to be levied on ships when they are at Um Qasr and not when they are at Basra? (So far as I gather, they have not yet ac£X£hlly come into operation.) It is the actual collection of the money that requires legislation, and whatever else may be incidentally involved the right to legislate, I take it, goes with sovereignty over the place of collection. Legislation by the Iraq Government for the collection of charges at Um Qasr would thus be a very different thing from legislation for their collection at Basra in respect of matters connected with Um Qasr. Mr* Lumby^ minute speaks of some charges being levied 'at the port itself”, and Colonel Hay says that 'presumably all dues are to be , recovered at that port'. If this is correct, we shawi. presumably ! object in to to to the arrogation to themselves by the Iraq Government 'i of a right to legislate for the collection of charges at Um Qasr. *2. M What puzzles me is that no one in the correspondence seems to take this fundamental objection. The argument is put forward on the Koweit side that the Iraq Government have no right to levy dues on ships entering a port that does not belong to them, and particular objection is taken to charges for services in the port itself. It seems to be implie d in places that there would have been no objection if the charges had been limited to those in respect of pilotage, lighting and buoying, and there are references to the general arrangement under which charges are collected at Basra for the lighting and buoying of the G-ulf. All this would suggest rather that the intention is to levy charges at Basra, and that the objection is to the Iraq Government framing their tariff in a way which suggests a claim to administrative interest in Um Qasr. (So far as right goes, they presumably have a 'right* to levy charges on ships at Basra on any ground they like?) r j ^ Possibly the answer is that the matter simply has not been ^ ■ t h° u &amp; irt out.** It may perhaps be contemplated that dues may be levied , at both places. I do not know how far it could be assumed that in . practice sea-going vessels 'navigating to Um Qasr' would call at Basra. ^ (Some similar assumption was made, I think, in respect of the general ^ /Wr/CcJi, lighting and buoying charges). If any charges are to be levied at ^ ^ ® asra &gt; on ly ^he Iraq Government could in the ordinary course legislate C. f or them. I do not know whether local arrangements are now such that/- R LOCK AND ^ that a notification imposing such charges at Basra could properly al Cfj;e may be t; be ’issued on behalf of the military authorities'. 0 f tins documem Possibly some further light is obtainable. fie ought to be quite clear as to the nature of our objections and the appropriateness of any suggested remedy. . l.%A 21.*^ ♦ - . -1 • . -7L^ 'V , k.

With regard to the 3rd paragraph of Sir L.Wakely»s note, ^ surely the 'fundamental objection' to which he refers has been taken both by the Government of India and by the Bjlitical Resident. The Government of India, in paragraph 2 of their telegram No*7183 September 9 th, protest against the notification as prejudicing the question of 'sovereign rights in Un Qasi^and approaches'. Colonel Hay says that it would appear that the 'military administration is the sole authority entitled to issue a notification of the kind in question'; and Colonel Prior seems to be making the same point in the first sentence of paragraph 3 , of his telegram No .2301. Admittedly, paragraphs 2 and 3 of /q • • Colonel Hay'S express letter of September 9th and paragraph 2 . i-ilt V . ° f Colonel Prior's telegram imply that there is less objection f-t'- l r', t0 i^e perfonnance by the Basra Port Authorities of services in ' . th® approaches to the port than in the port itslof.

Mr .lock confirms what was said in paragraph 6 of Mr .^Thompson *s despatch, via., that the services covered by paragraph 3 the notification will all be performed by the military authorities. There seems no reason why charges for these services should be levied anywhere elserthan at Um Q^asj^r. The only difficulty arises in respect of the services covered by paragraphs 1 and 2, since the Basra Port Directorate are the only people who have the dredgers needed to keep the Khor Abdul la clear. Mr .lock suggests that the Directorate should perform these services under contract to the military authorities. Under this arrangement there would be no question but that the services were being performed and the charges collected by order of these authorities; though it would be necessary to obtain the consent of the Iraqi Government to one of their organs entering into a contract with an outside authority.

With reference to the correspondence resting with ry demi-official letter to Mr. Baxter, No.Ext.2339/^2 of the l 6 th June last regarding the port of Um Qasr,.

Embassy at Bagdad, No.290 of 13 th October, 1942 o 2. The Secretary of State is in full agreement with the Political Resident and the Government of India that steps must be taken to ensure that the T^Jotification in question in no way prejudices the rights and interests of the Sheikh of Koweit. On the question of how best this can be done, Mr. Amery shares the view of the Political Resident that any communication to the Iraqi Government should be made by H.M.G. on their own behalf, and that in consequence/consequence 'the Sheikh, should not he invited oo act in the manner proposed in paragraph 5 Thompson* s V- despatch. On the other hand, lir. Ameiy is in some . = • doubt vdiether an acknowledgment by the Iraqi Government of* a communication on the lines recommended in paragraph 5 of the Political Resident*s telegram would effectually Ofi Sotkx JuXZwl, prevent them from making use of the^lotii ication -to. ^ support thaws ^territorial claims. 3. In these circumstances Mr. Amery considers that it would be advantageous if the whole question could be discussed between the two Departments, and he would be glad to .learn whether Mr. nlden agrees that an early meeting should be arranged for this purpose. ^ „ -i o m § 2 - daJL * &gt; a 73 m 1 C U) m m ^ n 2 0 5 o 1^ CL (9 p Td &lt; o (D '£■ O 3*5 ft, Cft ^ o ^ 00 m r m to (iigd.)

The references to Abadan and Bahrain are scarcely relevant since Iraq does not claim them. Persia is most careful toward the simplest (corrupt group) so as to preserve her claim to Bahrain though they have had no jurisdiction for 150 years and yet when Iraq legislated for a disputed area North -West of it (sic) 'l ittle more than a formality'. 4. Paragraph 4 of Baghdad letter begs the whole question. It has not been decided that port is in Iraq territory. If we are sincere in protecting Koweit v s interests we must act with same intelligence and vigour that we should show if our own territory were at stake and be scrupulous not to prejudice her interests in any way. 5o I feel it is scarcely reasonable to ask Sheikh to act in the manner proposed nor I am afraid will he be (?impressed) by a statement that his rights will be fully protected at some future (?date). (VI recommend that) brief note should be sent to Iraq Government quoting notification 'which was issued by Sir John Ward on behalf of military authorities regarding Urn i^asr' and mentioning that paragraph No.3 will no longer have any force as military authorities are administering port themselves.

X imagine that the notification was issued as a matter of routine by the Basra Port Directorate and that there was no malice aforethought on tne part of the 6 Iraq Government, i note that light dues are recovered by the Iraq Government on behalf of the Government of India for services rendered throughout the Persian Gulf of. paragraph 17 of the Memorandum on the Lighting and Buoying of the Persian Gulf 1908-1928 which forms part of the Committee of imperial Defence document P.G.13 (copy enclosed for ready reference) presumably on the basis of similar notifications, m spite of the above I feel bound to take objection to the present notifica tion. Paragraph 3 in particular makes provision for the recover ies of charges for the use of Gmm Q,asr port itself and as such appears to be contrary to the agreement reached vide your tele- £ram Uo.3&amp;7 dated the 4th Apri l 19 42 to His Xajesty’s Secretary of State for koreign Affairs that the port of Umm Q.asr should be entirely under military administration without interference from the Iraq or Kuwait Government. Purther, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notification ignore Kuwait’s admitted rights in the Khor Abdulla. Though i do not for a moment suppose that this i was done deliberately with an eye to theiuture, X feel that the l whole notification if left unchallenged may at some future date ; | usee, by an Iraq Government to support extravagant claims. I also feel that the Shaikh of Kuwait when he becomes aware of the / / notificationnotification will be justified in making a strong protest, and that it is incumbent upon'us to ensure that his case will not in any way be prejudiced by it. 4. I would accordingly strongly urge that the present notification should be cancelled and be replaced by a notifica tion in similar terms issued by the military administration of Umm Q,aer. The notification only applies to vessels entering Uam w,asr and presumably all dues are to be recovered at that port. The port up to the present has been adjudged neither to Iraq nor to Kuwait and has been purposely left as neutral ground under a military administration, in the circumstances it would appear that that administration is the sole authority entitled to issue a notification of the kind in question. 5. Please telegraph whether you are willing to arrange for action to be taken on the lines proposed above or if not whether you have any ether line of action to suggest which will satisfy the shaikh of Kuwait and ensure that his claims are not prejudiced. 7.

(Communicated by India Office and reyised to 29th August 1928). After the war, with the elimination of Turkish and German interests in the Gulf, Hie Majesty’s Govern ment were anxious to direst themselves of f inanclal comri.itments, and in 1923 an inter-departmental conference recommended that light dues should be levied at Basra and Abadan. It was ascertained that in 1922 96 per cent, of the shipping which crossed the Shati-el-Arab bar «&amp;s British. The British shipping interests were consulted, and it was agreed that an Advisory Committee should be formed of coonaercial and shipping representatives to work in partnership with the Government of India in the administration of the new Lighting and Buoying Fund; the Ira^ Government agreed to levy the dues, which were put into force (at the rate of 3 annas a ton, since reduced to 1| annas &amp; ton) on the 1st November 1926. His Majesty’s Govern ment agreed to contribute £ 5,000 a year for fire years, subject to review at the end of that period* Admiralty tankers were to be exempted from dues. Bo law has been passed by the Iraq Government to provide for the levy, but it appears that the dues are satisfactorily collected at Basra and Abadan, without real legal authority, by the port Directorate.(Received under Ambassador Bagdad^ Printed Letter No.50/61/42 dated 25th August 1942.)
