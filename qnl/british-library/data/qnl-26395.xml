The agreement provided for monthly payments of Rs.400 but cur papers do not show to whom the payments are due, 3 . We have, however, recently received a request for payment to the Ministry of Civil Aviation of the sum of £310 Os Od, representing payments made by the Political Resiuent at the rate of Rs. 400 a month for the period October, 1946 to February, 1948 to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi for facilities including petrol storage at Yas Island, the Seer Island, or Sir-Beni-Yas Island. 4. The latest reference quoted by the Residency is No, 221-81/IL of the 14th April, 1946 and I think the ^ueooiofto for wbdch pay ment is demanded are the same as those referred to in paragraph 1 above.

The present Agreement cdvering this landing ground is due to expire on the 27th August 1948 and if neither the R.A.F. nor the B.O.A.C. are likely ’to require air facilities in Kalba in future, I suggest that the Ruler be given adequate warning that the Agreement will be allowed to lapse and that no further payments will be made to him after the 27th August 1948.

Copy of memorandum No.C/258 dated 14th March 1948, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain* Copy is enclosed of memorandum No.89.0220 dated the 24th January, 1948, from the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. It is requested that it be ascertained whether the R.A.F. or 3.O.A.C. require air facilities in Kalba any longer. If not, the agreement should be allowed to lapse, no payment should be made after August of this year. Copy of memorandum No.89.0220 dated the 24th January 1948, from the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, bharjah, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. On my visit to Kalba on the 20th and 21st January I inspected the landing ground, petrol store, and shelter for air crews. The markings on the landing ground are dirty and would be difficult to see from the air, the ground is overgrown with small bushes, the petrol store is empty and unlocked, and the shelter for air crews is in disrepair. 2. Of the 10 rifles given in 1936 to the Regent of Kalba for the protection of the aerodrome none remain. All are reported to have been sold. The one rifle given to Shaikh Khalid remains with ^ne of Shaikh Saqr's (brother of Humaid bin Abdullah) servants. 3. The air agreement signed in August 1936, was to remain in force for a period of 12 years and, unless renev/ed, will lapse this year. 4. I understood from Air Vice Marshall Gray, whom I met on my return here, that the R.A.F. no longer require air facilities in Kalba. 5. If neither the R.A.F. nor B.O.A.C. are likely to require air facilities in Kalba in future, it is for con sideration whether the agreement should not be terminated in August of this year and the monthly payment of Rs.400/- discontinued. .IMBT LETTER Ext.B4V-4^ R.A.

To complete the picture I enclose a copy of the Political Resident's telegram 489 of 23rd April. The reference in paragraph 4 of this telegram is to the second paragraph of Section 2 of the report of the meeting of the Ministry of Civil Aviation's Planning Committee on 1st March (PC/79). It was there stated that theAir Ministry proposed to maintain the xviuharraq airfield oh something more than a care and maintenance basis and would keep a 24 hour radio watch. 2 . The position as I see it is now as follows:- y 3 SxtxsM- 1 /3erc4&lt;. (a) Sharjah . B.O.A.C. are to evacuate the fort and Cable and wireless are to take frvavev ahdMwhe wireless station there.^ (P.R's telegram 544). This appears to conflict with the statement in para 3 of Low's letter A 773131/36 of 28th March that the B.O.A.C. fort will be required by the R.A.F. if it is to be vacated by B.O.A.C. Meanwhile we have heard that an Indian air line wants to run a service from India to Iraq, stopping at Sharjah and Iraqi Airways may wish to run a similar service. I am awaiting a reply from you to my letter No. Ext 654, dated Major H. Jones, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ariel H use, ' Strand, w.C.2. 1st/1 , £ jr * M 'm&amp; War- -W.. -* lLk\ 3A « £T«* ■# r; ‘ ■ : r :I? si 1st April, 1947 (b) Bahrein. (Muharraq).

The accanmodation may be handed over to the Arabian American Oil'. Co. (p.R.'s tel 543). Meanwhile an Indian and an Iraqi airline may shortly be wanting facilit^st at Muharraq. The P.R. enquires whether the Air Ministry or B.O.A. C. can be persuaded to retain the accommodation for use by air passengers, and adds that without* these and other facilities it may be impossible to authorise any a schedule land plane services stopping at Bahrein.^ I 3 . The position is thus somewhat involved and wonder if it might not help to straighten things out if^ we could have a meeting to discuss the various points raised.

You will see thao the' latter are a mere handful,and we think it would be as well to retain them as an insurance rather than that they should be demolished or that we should have to meet a suggestion that they should be occupied by local Arabs. We will therefore require to retain all the R.A.F. buildings at Sharjah. 5* We agree that ground rent should be paid by the R.A.F. for the R.A.F. camp with effect frcm the end of the Japanese war.

Dated 17th February ) 2. «ith regard to paragraph 2 we should not wish to contest the Political Resident v s revised opinion that it is preferable not to amend the existing agreement till the time comes to consider its renewal. We imagine you will agree. 3. With regard to paragraph 3 ee should be glad to know whether the Ministry of Civil Aviation are prepared to ask B.O.A.C. to continue to man the fort at Sharjah to provide facilities for local private and commercial traffic. I presume that the answer to this may depend to some extent on the outcome of M.C.A'a recent discussions with I.O.A.C. for the oantinuai,ce of local Persian Gulf services. 4. With reference to paragraphs 4 and 5 should be glad to have the Air Ministry's comments and to know whether they agree to the Political Resident now being authorised to inform the Sheikh that he will be paid ground rent for the \.A.P. camps with effect from the end of hostilities with Japan. 3* To enable us to reply to paragraph 6 we should also be glad if you would let us have in due course a statement of the R.A.F's future requirements at Sharjah (I note from paragraph 3 M.W.

F. A. K. HARRISONCONFIDENTIAL Repeated No,325-S To From Dated the IVth February 1947 Ext. 8473/46, dated the 30th December 1946. Air Facilities at SharjaKT 2. Reference paragraph 3. On further considera tion I have come round to the opinion that it is prefer able not to alter the existing agreement if this can be avoided. The Shaikh is pressing for an increase in his subsidy, payment of ground-rent, etc. and probably would only agree to alterations of the kind proposed if his claims are satisfied. By the time a decision is reached regarding these claims it is possible that the existing agreement will have almost if not quite expired, and we shall then find ourselves compelled to offer him further inducements to enter into a new agreement. I therefore suggest that the agreement be left as it stands and that we make up our minds as soon as possible what our require ments are for the future and what we are willing to pay for them. We may then find it convenient to negotiate a new agreement before the date of expiry of the present one. 3. The fort at Sharjah is still manned by B.O.A.C. personnel and I understood from a B.O.A.C. representative who recently visited Bahrain as a member of the air survey party that it should not be difficult for the Corporation to arrange for some of their personnel to remain there indefinitely. I am particularly anxious that the B.O.A.C. should continue to man their wireless station at Sharjah * as they make this available for local private and commercial traffic. If the Royal Air Force take it over this will presumably no longer be the case. Further if the B.O.A.C. continue to hold the fort even with a skeleton staff it itfill make it easier for us to leave the existing civil air agreement in its present form. Provided therefore there is no objection from the point of view of the Air Ministry I should be grateful if the B.O.A.C. would be asked to continue to hold charge of the fort and to work their wire less station. 4. With reference to paragraph 4 of your express letter. The Shaikh agreed to grant facilities to the Roa^l Air Force as a war-time measure, vide papers forwarded of hostilities. With regard to the Air Ministry*s suggestion that the Shaikh might be induced to withdraw or reduce his demandits* 1 in* ^ , jaj demand for rent as a quid pro quo from buildings which are to be abandoned and handed over to him, so far as I was able to ascertain from enquiries on the spot the only buildings which are likely to be abandoned in the near future are the recently vacated Iraq Levy lines which are mostly constructed of matting. These sire immediately adjacent to the main part of the Royal Air Force camp and it would appear to a layman that if these were to be taken over by the Shaikh and occupied by locals some embarrassment would be caused to the # Royal Air Force in the adjoining camp. In any case I doubt if the Shaikh would be willing to accept any substantial reduction in rent if the buildings concerned are handed over to him, and I would suggest that it would be more satisfactory if the R.A.F. were to dismantle them and sell the materials. that I may be authorised to inform the Shaikh that he will be paid ground rent for the R.A.F. camp with effect from the date of cessation of hostilities with Japan. I will then make recommendations regarding the amount of rent which should be offered to him. Royal Air Force and the B.O.A.C. (if any) at an early date to enable us to consider here what form the future air agreement should take and what payments should be offered to the Shaikh besides the ground rent discussed above, and to make recommendations accordingly. 5. In the light of the above remarks I request 6. If my proposal in para 2 is accepted may I kindly be informed of the future requirements of the ATTESTED te; Political Resident, Persian Gulf (SGD.)

With regard to Dubai if it is desired that the moorings should be left in place in case of emergency it will be necessary to reach some kind of agreement with the Shaikh. In the circum stances I am inclined to think that it will be best to let the present agreement suitably amended remain in force until it expires which it is due to do on the same date viz. the 22nd July 1948. It may be argued that Rs. 940/- p*a* is rather a high sum to pay for the facilities now required but neither the original agreement nor the correspondence regarding its extension appear to contain any provision for its premature termination by either party* Sd. ¥.R*HAY.

(B) 10, FLEET STREET LONDON E.C.4. I 94P ) 10th April, 19^6* Dear Oorell Barnes, Will you please refer to correspondence under Treasury reference S. 3908? in regard to the Agreement which was entered into with the Sheikh of Sharjah with the object of securing landing and transit facilities for air serviaes passing along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. The agreement provides for the following payments to the Sheikh:- (a) Provision of guards at Rs. 780 a month (b) Rent for the Air Station of Rs. 800 a month (c) Personal subsidy of Rs* $00 a month (d) Rent for the Rest House of Rs« 300 a month (The Rest House was built at Air Ministry expens£ but is the property of the Sheikh* Rent under item (d) is set off against the/888st9uction agreed at Rs.70,929) (e) Landing fee of Rs 3 for each civil aircraft using the aerodrome c /The W*L« Gore 11 ftirnes Treasury Chambers London S*W«1 #!ot The agreement was for a period of eleven years from 22nd January 1932 and was extended in July 19/f3 for a further five years, as an essential war requirement. In 1%4 the local R.A.F. authorities a agreed, on representations made by the Sheikh, that the pay of the guards should be increased, as a temporay war arrangement hK_Rs* 3 each per month, or Rs. 183 p®r month altogether, in o. .er to compensate for the increase in the cost of living. We have now been asked by the Government of India to agree to a general increase in the rates payable undee this Agreement as the Sheikh feels strongly that the present rates are inadequate in relation to the considerable increase of traffic and facilities provided at Sharjah and to the post-war level of prices, etc. The proposals under the various headings set out below are as follows:- (a) Pay of the 33 guards and 2 Headman to be increased by a further Rs. 10 a month each additional to the increase of Rs. 3 a month already granted, subject to revision should the cost of living fall. The present wages of the guards are some Rs 3 less than those of an average daily labourer in the district, and it is clearly necessary for the protection of passengers and property that the Guards should be paid sufficient to keep them contented and reliable. (b) Rent of Air Station to be increased to Rs.l$000 a month. The Sheikh has, since 1932, accorded greatly enlarged facilities for the RA.F. and civil Aviation, including a large^for the R.A.F* and increased accommodation for the civil establishment, wireless staff etc. (o) Personal subsidy to be increased to Rs. 800 a month The present cost of goods and labour in the district is very much higher than in 1932. Furthermore, the development of civil aviation generally, and the new pjitical considerations mentioned later in this letter, have enhanced the importance of retaining the goodwill of the local ruler. /(d)mmmm (d) No increase in the rent of the Rest House is recommended by the Political Representatives, since the present figure is related to the original cost offcJ&amp;S building. Subsequent additions to the building have/made on the conditions (i) that the cost would not be recovered from the Sheikh , aid (ii) that the additions would become his property if we gave up the station* Landing fee to be increased to Rs. 10* This is, of course low for a large modern commercial aircraft, but the political Resident does not favour the suggestion of a sliding scale as imposed elsewhere* as he attaches importance to simplicity of administration* This increase would not involve us in any additional expenditure' as under existing conditions B*0.A*C* l andplanes do not call at this point*(^’he Rest House is used for Flying Boat Passengers. ) We regard the reasons put forward in supoort of these increases as being sound* and consider that the proposals should be agreed to. There are, however, urgent political reasons which have b®en advanced* At the Chicago Conference, H.M.O. in signing the Chicago Air Agreements, undertook obligations on behalf of various Sheikhdoms along the Arabian Coast as territories under British, protection, and it now remains to induce these local rulers, to fulfil these obligations, including the grant to foreign aircraft of the same rights in their territory. The position is somewhat delicate, and it is essential that we should maintain the goodwill of the Trucial Sheikhs at the present Juncture, particularly in face of the development of American interests in Arabia. I should therefore be glad to have your covering approval of the increases proposed, which( apart from (e)) involve an annual expenditure of £950 over and above that allowed for on the original agreement. We realise, of course, that we shall in all probability be faced with similar requests from the other Sheikhs, and that we may have to allow corresponding increases in all cases. But we cannot afford to risk endangering the concessions that we have obtained, and .maintained with so much difficulty in the past, for the sake of a camparatively «mall financial saving. /The,am The agreements with all the Sheikhs fall due for renewal in l%-8, by which time our requirements in this area should have been clarified.

Sharjah Air Agreement The Shaikh of Sharjah recently refused acceptance of the payments for June and July due to him under the Sharjah Air Agreement of 22nd July 1932. Following a visit by the Political Agent, Bahrain, he accepted payment and has now written request-* ing an increase in payments under the following heads: (a) Pay of guards (b) Rent for the Air Station of Hs.800 per mensem (c) Personal subsidy of fis.500 per mensem (d) House rent for the rest house of 8s.300 per mensem (e) Landing fees. 2. The pay of the guards was fixed in the Agreement of 1932 at 8s.20 per mensem for each of the 36 guards and Bs.40 per mensem for each of the two headmen. Following a representation by the Shaikh in 1944 a temporary war allowance of 8s.5 per mensem was granted to the guards and headmen (Air Headquarters Iraq telegram NoP 576 dated 3rd March 1944, copy not forwarded to India Office or Government of India)• Prices and wages have not fallen since 1944 and even with this allowance the wage of a guard is some 5 rupees less than that of daily paid labour ' . The Shaikh is responsible for the local protection of the aeroorome, the aerodrome establishment, passengers and aircraft and it is essential that the guards should be paid at least sufficient to keep them contented and reliable. I recommend, therefore, that f the allowance paid to the guards and headmen should be increased from Bs.5 to Bs.15 with effect from 1st January 1946. In informing the Shaikh it could be stipulated that this allowance is liable to revision should the cost of living fall* 3* As regards (b) and (c) I consider that for the followii^ reasons the Shaikh is justified in asking for an increase. (i) the fall in the value of money since 1932 shown by the present high cost of goods and of labour. (Signature) / UD (Designation) S. 41 MFP—1460 S*P—&lt;M.2386)—20-3-40—15,000.- 2 //© (ii) the greatly enlarged facilites that have from time to time been accorded by the Shaikh since 1932 for the Royal Air Force and for Civil Aviation e.g. a large camp for the R.A.F., increased accommodation for civil establishment, Wireless staff etc., all of which have been willingly accorded by the Shaikh. I/therefore recommend that the rent for the Air Station should be increased to Rs.1000 a month and the personal subsidy (c) to Rs.800 per month. Considerable use of Sharjah both for Military and Civil purposes is likely to continue for some time, and in any case the payments will automatically come under revision not later than 22nd July 1948, when the renewal of the existing agreement is due to expire, and by which time a decision will presumably have been reached as to the extent of our future requirements at Sharjah. 4. As regards (d), the existing rental for the rest house of fis.300 per mensem is set off against the fixed sum of Ks«70,929, estimated as advanced to the Shaikh for the construction of the rest house (R.A.F., Paiforce letter No.CE/BH/884, dated 27th June 1944 to my address, copy not forwarded to India Office or Government of India)• There have subsequently been additions to the rest house but the Shaikh was assured in 1937 (i) that the cost of additional accommodation would not be recovered from him and (ii) that additional construction would become his property if we gave up the station (Residency Express Letter No.192- S, dated 12th February 1937 to India Office, repeated to Bahrain only). I do not, therefore, consider that any increase under this head is justified, and do not recommend any* The reasons can be explained to the Shaikh by the Political Agent, Bahrain. 5. As regards («) the landing fee fixed in the agreement of 1932 was Es.5 per commercial aeroplane, payable to the Shaikh. Under Article 9 of the Kuwait and Bahrain Agreements, landing fees are retained by His Majesty 1 s Government against the consideration paid to the Shaikh under Article 16. It wilj be seen that the fees actually charged at these two places range from £.0-2-6 to over £ 2 according to the weight of the aircraft. As the weight of commercial aircraft has increased greatly in the last 14 years I consider that the Shaikh is justified in asking for an increase of the landing fee and suggest that it should be raised to Rs.10 per aircraft. At this rate the average aircraft would still be paying considerably less than in Bahrain or Kuwait. In the interests of simplicity I do not recommend the imposition of a sliding scale as at these two places. 6. Unless some increases are made in existing payments to the Shaikh I foreee considerable difficulty, if not failure, in persuading him to agree to the assumption of international obligations ( cf. India Office telegram No.493 dated 7th January 1946, and connected correspondence not repeated to Air Headquarters, / Paiforce)Paiforce) accepted by His Majesty^ Government on his behalf without reference to him. As the Shaikh is being approached on this subject, I should be grateful for a very early reply* Sd. GEOFFREY PRIOR Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

Letter dated the 21st April 1943 from.Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, to the Political Officer, 3. Since the agreement was to be extended by five years from 22nd July 1943 and not from 1st July 1943 I asked the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to obtain the Shaikh* s assent to the small change necessary in what had been agreed to in the correspondence referred to above. The Shaikh agreed to the modification suggested, and I enclose a copy of his letter to this effect,d ated the 16th JUne 1943, addressed to the Residency Agent, Sharjah. 4. It will be seen that the Shaikh of Sharjah, in his letter of 21st April 1943, states that the rent paid fdr use of the aerodrome is small in view of present conditions, and hints that an increase would be welcome. I do not consider that the suggestion of an increase in rent need be taken seriously, especially as the Dubai Air Agreement has been extended for five years on the existing terms. Moreover, I have seen the Shaikh of Sharjah on several occasions since his letter was written and he has never mentioned to me the question of an increased rent for the aerodrome* He has, on the other hand, waxed eloquent on the subject of steamers failing to call at Sharjah - a right to which he justifiably attaches great value. 5. In his letter of 21st April 1943 the Shaikh of Sharjah, while agreeing to the renewal of the Air Agreement, draws the attention of the British Government to their undertaking that commercial steamers should call at Sharjah. That undertaking, though it may/be inconvenient to observe it, is binding on the British Government; and the Shaikh is justified in bringing the matter up in connection with the renewal of the Air Agreement since it was in connection with that Agreement that the undertaking was originally given (vide Colonel Dickson* s 1943. 1.

Since then steamers have called at Sharjah with shipments of cereals provided 'toy the M.S.S.C. and the Government of India, but no coi une-ciPl cnrnc has been discharged at tori ah fcr more than ll months , and I am inf ormed both by the Shaikh and the Residency Agent that the Shipping Company* a agents at Bombay and Karachi refuse to accept cargo for Sharjah* They insist on cargo for Sharjah being consigned to Dubai. 7. The Shaikh of Sharjah has spoken to me in the strong est possible terms about the decline in the nrosperity of Sharjah caused by the transfer of all steamer-borne trade to Dubai; and the Shaikh of Sharjah’s letter of 21st April 1943 means, if it is correctly interpreted, that the Shaikh agrees to the senewal of the Air Agreement on condition that the British Government carry out their undertaking, given when the Air Agreement was first entered into, that com mercial steamers should call at Sharjah. 8. In my opinion the matter is of great importance as it Involves the implementing of a pledge given by the British Government in terms which admit of no argument. And that pledge is not at present being honoured. I request that steps be taken to ensure that in future at least one steamer a month calls at Sharjah (or that one steamer calls at Sharjah for every two that call at Dubai) and that the Shipping Company be given orders in unambiguous terms to accept cargo consigned to Sharjah by exporters at Bombay and Karachi. 5d/- 7], B.

It is understood that H.B.M*s Government wish the renewal of the Agreement reached bet ween me and the B.O.A.C. on 22nd July 1932 and its extension for 5 years from 1st July 1943 and I accordingly agree to that while directing the attention of the Govern ment to my right to the calling of commercial steamships at my torn of Sharjah as was promised to me by the Govern ment in its letter dated 17th Rabi ul Awwal 1351 attached to the above mentioned agreement. Steamships continued calling regularly at Sharjah until the last steamship Virginia (Voyage No. 1) arrived from Karachi on 25th Aug ust 1942 (13th Sha’ban 1361). They then stopped coming with no small harm to the trade of Sharjah to the extent that many merchants left the town. As the rent paid by the Company to me is small in view of present conditions I expect gracious kindness from the Government, and I am sure that the Government will estimate our rights and we will not cease to thank it for its good intentions towards us and we supplicate 1»'God and pray to Him to grant to the Government victory over its enemies the dictators.

Jones, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Mr. Warren, Air Ministry, Mr. N.J.A. Cheatham, Foreign Office. FAST AIR MAIL CONFIEBNTIAL Sir, I am directed ty the Secretary of State to say that the Ministry of Civil Aviation have been informed by B.O.A.C. that when the 'C' class flying boats are withdrawn at the end of this year they will no longer need staging posts at Sharjah^ Dubai which are at present used for ’planes and flying boats respectively. They •nquir^ whether the R.A.F. have a continuing interest, in Sharjah and if so whether they would be prepared to maintain signals and other facilities there. So far as B.O.A.C. themselves are concerned they would only want to keep one mooring for emergency use. . . . /m eMG T /II ^ V1S13V0C e \ The Ministry of Civil Aviation consider that prima facie if B«0«A«C« no longer need to call at Sharjah and Dubai there is no reason why they should continue to provide facilities there unless in view of the present political situation in Persia it is considered desirable that the United Kingdom should retain any foot-holds they already have on the Persian Gulf, — &lt; The present arrangements at Sharjah and Dubai are covered by agreements with the Sheiks. The original agreements terminated in 1943 when they were renewed for a further 5 years. They therefore have 2 more years to run before expiring. The agreements provide for the provision and operation by Imperial Airways (now B.O.A.C) of aerodrome facilities for their own purposes at . specified financial terms and for landings by S.A.P# aircraft free of cost. &gt;•44C It is thou^it that the R.A.F* have in fact a continuing interest in Sharjah which they contemplate retaining as a staging post on the strategic route to the East but that this will not necessarily involve regular flights. Apart from the political considerations the Ministry of Civil Aviation point out that India is also interested because she will sooner or later be operating air lines to the Persian Gulf from Karachi to Basrah and may need the use of the stations and they would be grateful to have the views of the Government of India on this aspect. . If there are any strong objections on political grounds to B.O.A.C.’s evacuation of Sharjah the R.A.P. would have to make their own arrangements for the manning of this station and the change from civil to military status would presumably require /the.All MO f /(| f J the negotiations of a new agreement or at any rate very clear understanding with the Sheik of Sharjah* Before discussing this possibility further the Ministry of Civil Aviation wish to secure the views of the Foreign Office and of the Government of India as regards the political aspect about which you may care to consult External Affairs Department* It should, however, be borne in mind that in the event of it being desirable that the station should continue to be maintained by B*O.A.C* there would be very real practical difficulties in doing so in view of its isolated position if no regular service were operated there.

A list of buildings required at Sharjah by the RAF as of 1947 can be found on folios 24-28.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffrey Prior and William Rupert Hay), officials of the Air Ministry (M W Low), officials of the India Office (from August 1947 the Commonwealth Relations Office; Roland Tennyson Peel, Eion Pelly Donaldson, Francis Anthony Kitchener Harrison), officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation (H Jones and R C Bloodworth), and representatives of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.The title of the file contains an error: the British Overseas Airways Corporation is mistakenly referred to as BAOC instead of BOAC.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
