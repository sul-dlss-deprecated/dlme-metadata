' Bn tisti B e sidency and Oonsulate G-eneral , Bushire. 28th April, 1943. Dear Hamtll The Minister of External Affairs at Muscat raised the question with the Political Agent last month of a British flag, presumably a TThite Ensign, which was slid to have been flying at Ghanam island on Khar Quwai since January 1942. He asked that the Sultan f s pennission should be obtained for it. It will be seen from paragraph 5 of Political Agent Muscat's letter to the Besident No.81/S dated 28th March 1935( a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of India under express letter No.0/64 of April 2nd 193F) that we have already stated that no flag would be flown, so our position is not a very strong one. 2 . I thought, however, that the flag must be flying for some particular purpose, and probably had some significance in connection with naval signals there, and I therefore asked His Highness in conversation if he frould have any objection to the flag continuing to be flown, provided it was understood that this was simply a war measure Although His Highness is unduly sensitive in matters of bunting, he readily agreed, but asked that the Political Agent should address him on the subject. This is now being done, and I hope that we shall hear no mo about it. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Gove ent of India, the India Office, and the Political Agent uscat.

Consul Bandar Albas has telegraphed place of convoy assembly has been changed from Bandar Abbas to Khassab Bay for an indefinite period.itoong other subjects the discussed toda^ t was the naral base at Khor Kuwai* He mentioned that avy have put up buildings on a scale considerably larger than that contemplated by the original undertaking with the Sultan, and also that they were erecting a powerful wireless station. He wondered whether it would be advantageous to take up the question with the Sultan now, and have it regularized, or to leave it for the present, I said that, apart from the Khor Kuwai agree* ment, we had a subsidiary agreement with the Sultan by which he bound himself to give us all the facilities we required during the war, and that I thought this would cover any developments at Khor Kuwai beyond those origin ally contemplated, I suggested, therefore, that we should leave things as they are till the conclusion of hostilities, and then if the Havy found that they^required facilities incompatible with the agreement we could take up the question with the Sultan in the light of existing circustanoee and get them placed on a permanent footing.

Vvlth reference to your letter 3~&amp; of 2nd January f \947t the present state of affairs at Khor Kmai is that with one exception all the naval Base buildings are contained on the peninsular SM SAL IB at the North East tip of the island. £. the exception to the above is the transnitting station &amp;n6 three fc/T Masts with a %/t earth array, which is sited about five hundred yards due west of lias Salih on top of a hill about 160 feet high. The whole is contained in an area about 200 by 120 feet. 3. TIjs whole base is in Care and Haintei^ance under ti* charge of a Caretaker and about six local coolies t who are paid and provided with certain rations by the Loyal Navy. Hone of the buildings are used by the Hoyal Navy other than by tills ceretaking party. 4. It is known that Their Lordships attaeh Ui± greatest importance to the retention of fChor Kuval and its facilities - particularly the b/T station - in case of the general situation in the Persian Gulf should at any time deteriorate. 6. From the papers that are available, there is little doubt that the scale of the base far exceeds any tiling visualised when first permission to use the Island way granted by His Highness the Sultan of Musest in 103C/36* *n particular the , erection of the Transmitting Station might be considered an encroachment. ^ O • o v * 6* Under these circumstances, it is requested that the Question of their retention in situ may be raised with the Lultan and ills permission obtained.

Proposals for the following facilities are covered by the file: an examination service at Khassab for ships entering the Persian Gulf; a small station on Little Quoin Island; the transferral of a convoy assembly port from Bandar Abbas to Khassab Bay; a small police force at Khor Kuwai; transferral of control of Khor Kuwai to the Royal Air Force for the operation of air-sea rescue craft; permission to fly the flag on Ghanam Island; and the retention of buildings and facilities at Khor Kuwai following the end of the Second World War. Permission for all such facilities required the authority of the Sultan of Muscat, Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] and the correspondence reflects this.Correspondence comes from: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Muscat; the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf; the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq; the Sultan of Muscat and his representatives; and officials at the India Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Khor Kuwai</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Naval bases</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000054#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
