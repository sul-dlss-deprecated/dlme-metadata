On my return from Basrah on tour on the Icth inst I was informed of the concentration at Baghdad of troops as 1 Battalion from rZerkook. to Baghdad 1 do do —Mosul to do 1 do do—Salahiyeh (.Kifri; do-had been issued and that these •1 do do rlillah to Baghdad 1 do do — Shatra to Baghdad 1 do do— ai to Baghdad.— 1 do do Amarah to Baghdad per margin or rather that orders for the concentration SJ seven Battalions with three already at Baghdad together with 6 guns 4 Officers 120 Gunners ,150 'orses, aggregating * in all about 6000 men were to hold themselves in readiness to proceed on service,it is rumoured to 'oweit. I communicated this intelligence to -.J], the Ambassador at Constantinople in cypher and received a reply to the effect that the troops,so he had heard,were to be used as a punitive force to cover a rumoured disaster to Turkish arms with the Arab tribes somewhere south. A few hours after receipt of the above telegram another telegram was received from the Embassy quoting one from the Assistant Political Agent at Basrah,Fir. Forbes,saying th:,.t no news of a Turkish disaster had been received there but that a rumour was prevalent at Basrah that. Sheikh -asim bin Thani the well known Sheikh of El iCatr was collecting forces at Katr near Bahrein and was about to attack Sheikh Hubarak who had usurped the Chieftainship of iCoweit. Sheikh Fubarax has, I am informed,been in communi- -cation m J-cation with Mushir rtejeb Pasha of Baghdad and has aked for help against his rival and I cannot help thinking that my information,which points to Koweit as the destination of the Force confirmed as it is by the rumour at Basrah,is correct. The movement has at present been suspended but one of the uman Ottoman steamers,the M Mosul n ,has been detained here for the conveyance of troops to Basrah if necessary,and other steamers of the Fleet are to be detained as they arrive,so I am informed. Hushir P.ejeb Pasha visited Basrah in October last, remaining about a week,under the pretence of settling a quarrel between the Wali of that place and the Commodore of the Turkish fleet stationed there. At the beginning of last month Hohsin Pasha one of the high Commanders at Baghdad was sent to Basrah in connection with the same enquiry and while there he was instructed to relieve the Wali of his duties but when I was there the Wali still reigned and he and the_ Pasha were carrying on the administration together seated in chairs side by side each cancelling the order the other had issued. Kohsln Pasha's hand in the administration is only a blind to avert suspicion and he is intended for the command of the expedition I believe. I pass on now to discuss the affairs at Koweit. 2. You are aware that in May 1396 Sheikh Mubarak murdered his brothers Muhammad Pasha el Sebah and oerrah and seized Koweit and that one of the murdered brother's son with the help of Sheikh Yusuf bin Ibrahim fpf Itera) his maternal uncle has since fonce if not twice) attempted to recapture the town. In July last Saood the second son of Muhammad Pasha el ?5ebah visited Major Fagan,then Consul at Basrah,and expressed a hope that Her Majesty's G-cvernment would help him in his sore extremity and take him under protection. Major Fagan proposed visiting Koweit in -{.M's Gun-boat 'Pigeon'- but before sanctioning this I referred the question to Sir Philip !, ur ie who communicated with the Foreign Office at home and replied00188 replied to me to the effect that ier Majesty's Grovemment did not consider any interference on our part necessary unless British interests were involved and the peace of the Gulf endangered. In November last the '-Pigeon* 1 visited Koweit and reported that Slieikh ! T ubarak was most friendly and desirous of our protection. This much- I firmly believe that both factions would gladly avail themselves cf our protection and hate the Turks most bitterly. No ruler of -Koweit has ever shown fealty in any way to'the Sultan and I am credibly informed that the only instance of the Sheikh*5 applying to the Turkish authorities for&gt;help was that they requested that a iCazi might be nominated by them to administer' Huhammadan law,but this fell through owing to the proposed salary being too small to tempt any one to take up the appointment. Sheikh jasim bin Thani r above alluded to,has espoused the , cause of the murdered Sheikh's sons and has invested the of Katr which is held by a battalion of Turkish troops,with what result I am unaware, ^rom the latest information I hear that a portion of the troops are to leave Baghdad on the 25th instant in the 'Mosul* to be followed by other detachments in due course,the concentration to be made in Basrah. 4. But it maybe said that the affairs at Koweit are beyond my sphere and more properly connected with that of the Resident. Persian Gulf. This is true but I submit most defer- -entially that the occupation or protection by the Porte of Koweit would be a standing menace to our trade interests in Turkish Arabia. Scarcely a day passes but attempts are made to hamper our trade sometimes by vexatious quarantine regu- * f -lations at others by some move on the part of the Turkish authorities to gain complete control over the mouth of the Shattul Arab at Fao and it is from here that they must be watched and their actions checked. There is however another matter connected with this question which has lately forced itself on my attention. For some months past vague rumours haverx-* &lt; -6. ^ m I | i II I have been afloat that Russia and her Agents were working in the Gulf and I would invite your reference to my letter j : o .615-dated 15th ultimo in which Despatch lio.

You will observe that according to Consul Dickson's despatch H.Krouglow,late Russian Consul at erusalem,has been instructed to report,aiter his ar*ival,on the subject. fl .Krouglow has not yet arrived and it is now doubtful if he will come owing to a death vacancy at Aleppo in t'^.e Russian Consular Service which he is expected to fill# IT.Mashkow will in this case remain and the matter will be entrusted to him T presume. r1, T Tashkow is an intense Anglophobe and extremely active in intrigue and I firmly believe that, the Question of the Coaling Station will in the ne&gt;t few months come prominently to the front.

Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, enclosing two despatches which His Excellency has received from the British Delegate to the Constantinople Board of Health, relative to a proposal for the establishment of a lazaretto at or near Moham- merah, under the Turkish Sanitary Administration. As it is not clear whether the site suggested is in Turkish or Persian terri- torv cr how far it is adapted for the purposes of a sanitary station, it would seem to Lord Salisbury that, before coming to any definite decision with regard to the proposal, Her Majesty's Government must await the report which Her Majesty's Consul at Basra has been instructed to furnish on the subject ; but, pendlncr the receipt of these particulars, I am to state that His Lordship would be glad to receive any observations which Lord G. Hamilton may desire to offer with regard to it. I am, &amp;C., (Sd.) St. John Brodrick. % The Under Secretary of State, India Office.Constantinople ; February 4th&gt; i8gg. No. 14. Commercial. My Lord, I have the honour to enclose to Your Lordship herewith copies of two despatches addressed to me by Dr. Dickson on the subject of the proposal to establish at or near Mohammerah a lazaretto under the Turkish Sanitary Administration. In view of the new departure involved in the proposal for establishing a Turkish Health Office in Persian territory and of the various drawbacks which the proposed measure would entail, I have thought it advisable to report the circum stances to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran for the purpose of bringing them to the knowledge of the Persian Government who may not be aware of the proceed ings of their Delegate on the Board of Health. It would,, however, now appear that an islet in the Shatt-el-Arab, by name Shemshumie and presumably Turkish territory, is suggested as the site of the proposed lazaretto, and I have instructed Her Majesty's Consul at Basra to report to me on its fitness for that purpose. I propose, with Your Lordship's sanction, to approve Dr. Dickson's attitude in refusing to consent to the Board's proposal to establish a lazaretto at Mohammerah. I have, &amp;c., (Sd.) N. R. O'Conor. The Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., &amp;C., &amp;C., &amp;c. ko. 5. Constantinople; January 2 p Jth x i8gg. Sir, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that on the 24th Instant Dr. Cozzonis communicated to the Board of Health a telegram from the Vali of Basra announcing that he had had the islet of Shemshumie examined by the Government Civil Engineer with the view of establishing a lazaret upon it. This islet is situated in the Shatt-el-Arab opposite the canal which leads up to the Persian town of Mohammerah. As soon as the Vali's report on this question arrives here, it will be communicated to the Board of Health and discussed. This is evidently the question referred to in Mr. Consul Wratlslaw's telegram addressed to Your Excellency on the 3rd instant, I therefore take the liberty of suggesting that he might be Instructed to examine this islet and inform you of its actual distance from Basra, whether it would be suitable for a lazaret, whether its soil is dry or marshy, whether inhabited or not, and whether passengers and merchandize could easily be landed there. I have, &amp;c., (Sd.) E. D. Dickson.No. 2. 3 Dr. Dickson to Sir N. O'Conor. Constantinople ; January ijth, i8gg. 00331 Sir I have the honour to Inform Your Excellency that Dr. Cozzonis communi cated to the Board of Health on the loth instant a wish expressed by the Vali . of Basra and seconded by the Persian Consul at Basra that the Constan tinople Board of Health should appoint a staff of sanitary officers at Mohammerah for the purpose of applying at that place quarantine on arrivals from India. They 'pretend that by carrying out this measure passengers and goods from India, landed and performing quarantine at.Mohammerah, would be received afterwards in full pratique at Basra. Midhat Effendi, Vice-President of the Board of Health, and Dr. Panayoti Bey, the Persian Delegate on the Board, urged the adoption of this measure and proposed the nomination of a sub-committee to study the question and draw up a report on the mode of carrying it out. All or most of my colleagues— the foreign delegates—adhered to the proposal. I observed to the Board, how ever that what we required was a reply from the Porte as to whether it accepted or not the Sanitary Convention of Venice. If the Porte accepted it, we would have to carry out its prescriptions ; if not, we would then have to propose measures to replace those of the Venice Convention. Midhat Effendi insisted, however, on our accepting the Vali of Basra's proposal. This proposal could not, in my opinion, be realized owing to the want of room in the canal at Mohammerah for ships to lie there in quarantine and owing also to the want of a convenient isolated spot on which passengers could be put into quarantine. And besides this how could a quarantine applied at Basra on arrivals from Bushire be reconciled with the exemption from quarantine on arrivals from Mohammerah whilst freedom of intercourse by land existed between Bushire and Mohammerah. If Dr. Cozzonis, Midhat Effendi and Panayoti Bey are really anxious to save Basra from the Indian plague, why have they been putting off from week to week for the last year the question of establishing at Basra ^a suitable lazaret for arrivals from India? The reply is not difficult to find ; they are evidently bent on establishing Turkish control over the entire course of the Shatt-el-Arab; and having failed to accomplish this by creating a lazaret at Fao, they are now endeavouring to carry out their views by creating one at Mohammerah, a Persian town situated at the junction of the Carun river with the canal which connects that river with the Shatt-el-Arab. I beg to draw Your Excellency's attention to this incident as a warning of what would probably result in carrying out the proposal of the Venice Sanitary Conference of making the lazaret intended to be established at the mouth of th6 Persian Gulf a dependency of the Constantinople Board of Health. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Brodrick's letter, dated the 17th February 1899, with papers con cerning the proposed establishment of a Turkish quarantine station at or near Mohammerah. In reply I am to observe that Mohammerah is a Persian port, though Turkey has sometimes argued as if it were Ottoman territory. It is not known here whether the islet of Shemshumie belongs to Persia or to Turkey; and Lord George Hamilton would be glad to see the report of the Consul General at (Sd.) E. D. Dickson.

JN conlinuation of my despatch No. 474 of the 5th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith copy of a Secret despatch addressed to me on the SOrh September by Her Majesty's Consul at Bussorah, referring to his telegram relative to the rumoured application of the Sheikh of Kovveit for Persian protection, and reporting upon other matters connected with the position of affairs at Koweit. As regards the alleged application of Sheikh Mubarek, Mr. Wratislaw states that he considers the story improbable ; but it was officially related to the \ ali ot Bussorah by the ■-^Turkish Vice-Consul at Bushire. In a subsequent telegram from Mr. Wratislaw (see my despatch No. 474) he states that it has since received corroboration. A copy of Mr. Wratislaw's preceding despatch (No. 44, Secret, of the 16th September) is likewise inclosed, reporting the visit of Her Majesty's ship 44 Sphinx' to Bussorah on her wav back from Koweit to Bushire, and giving further information as to the relations between Sheikh Mubarek and the Vali of Bussorah. In this despatch Her Majesty's Consul expresses surprise at the mission of Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' to Koweit, which seemed to him uncalled for in the absence of any good reason to anticipate an impending attack on that place. I am reminding him in my reply of his telegrams of the 25th August and 7.th September respectively, which give the information upon which Her Majesty's Government were led to think it desirable that the British flag should be shown at Koweit. In the first of these telegrams Mr. Vv ratislaw reported the dispatch of a harbour master to Koweit, adding that there was a rumoured intention of likewise setting up an Ottoman Custom-house there, and in the second I was informed that the harbour-master had returned to Bussorah, and that the military authorities were strongly advocating the effective occupation of Koweit. , I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O'CONOR. .rr~ Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Wratislaw to Sir N. 0'Conor. (No. 45. Secret.) Bussorah, September 30, 1899. a. I HAVE the honour to report that by last mail Hamdi Pasha received a despatch from the Turkish Vice-Consul at Bushire, in which the latter stated, on the authority of high Persian officials,' that Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit had recently requested the Sheikh of Mohomerah to apply in his name to the Persian Government for Persian pro tection, and that this application had been referred to Tehran, and rejected by the Shah. . .... The Vice-Consul naturally attributed this incident to British intrigues. The above story appears highly improbable, but as it has formed the subject of an official Report, which will doubtless be passed on to Constantinople, I have thought right to submit it to your Excellency. Last week, a clerk (Ottoman subject) in the employ of Messrs. Hotz, Hamilton, and Co.. was called before the Vali and told that his Excellency had been informed that he was in the habit of giving information to ' English persons ' concerning the movements of [231-1] i N i 11Turkish troops, and what was passing at Koweit and elsewhere. He was warned that if the Vali heard such a report again he would be expelled from Bussorah. There is, I believe, no truth whatever in the accusation brought against the clerk, who is not in a position to supply information, and with whom I at least have had no communication, direct or indirect. He has probably been traduced by an enemy, but the incident shows the uneasiness of the Turkish authorities. The military party mentioned in my telegram No. 4 of the 22nd September returned to Bussorah after a short absence. No progress has been made with the Harbour-master question, so far as I know.

AS I have already had the honour to inform your Excellency by telegram, I received on the 13th instant a private letter dated the 11th September, from Captain Prideaux, Acting- Consul-General at Bushire, stating that he had been suddenly ordered off to Koweit in Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx,' which was to prevent any attack on the place by the Turks. As Captain Prideaux informed me that he was to keep in telegraphic communication with me and that the 'Sphinx would call at Fao, and as further I was aware that he would not he allowed to correspond with me by cypher within urkish territory, I thought it better to proceed to Fao myself, which I did, arriving there early on the morning of the 14th instant. I waited till night, but the Sphinx c ic not arrive, and Captain Hore, I.M.S., whom Captain Prideaux had left in charge ot the Consulate -General, was not. able to give me any further information respecting the expedition of the ' Sphinx ' except that some apprehension was caused by the move ments of a Turkish gun-boat. ^ i . To-day the ' Sphinx ' called here on her way back to Bushire, and I learned irom Captain Prideaux that nothing abnormal was occurring at Koweit and that Sheikh Mubarek was under no apprehension. ^ ^ \ II am at a loss to understand from whence the Indian G-overnment can have obtained information that an immediate attack on Koweit, necessitating a counter-move, was meditated by the Turks. It can hardly have been from my reports, which, I venture to submit, should be trusted rather than those of irresponsible informants. A military expedition on the scale required for the occupation ot Koweit, could hardly be organized with such secrecy that no news oi it would reach this C onsulate. The sea-going squadron maintained by the Turks in these waters consists solely oi one 'nm-boatTof 800 tons, the 'Zohaf,' now anchored off Bussorah and shortly to return her station on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf which she recently left withoM permission under circumstances already reported to your Excellency. Her iate consoit, the ' Seyad-i-deira,' a tiny vessel apparently of some 200 tons lef t Bussorah on the 4th instant, to endeavour to convey to Constantinople the time-expired Turkish sailors of the ' Zohaf,' and I presume it was her movements that gave rise to fears for the sal^ty There appears to be some friction at present between the Vali and Mouhsin Pasha, the Ferik in command of the troops here, for the former to-day sent me a message through my Dragoman to the effect that Moushin was unjustly blaming him for not having ,9;iven Mubarek notice of his intention to send a harbour-master to Koweit. Ilis Excellency said that he did not send off his functionary till twelve days after receipt of instructions from the Minister of Marine, which instructions he immediately referred to the Grand Vizier who, however, vouchsafed no reply. Sheikh Mubarek, backed up by the Nakib's family, had telegraphed to the Porte to complain of him (Hamdi) and it \\as evident from the Sheikh s present arrogant attitude that he had enteied into an agreement with some powerful Government, presumably the British, through the Bushire Residency.A 00345 T am informed, but I cannot vouch for the truth of the report, that Mouhsin Pasha, has accepted a heavy bribe from Mubarek, I am also informed that in his telegram to the Sultan concerning the harbour-master, Sheikh Mubarek declared that he was His Imperial Majesty's loyal subject and ready to execute his orders provided they were com municated direct and not through the Vali, whom he did not consider as his official superior. i i i i With regard to the succession question, Hamdi Pasha has instructed the legal adviser of the nephews to show himself more conciliatory and to endeavour to effect an arrangement. a.

I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a memorandum which has been drawn up by Mr. Stavrides, legal adviser to this Embassy, on the subject of an incident which recently occurred at Kweit, a port in the Persian Gulf near Bussorah. I am, &amp;c., Michael H. Herbert. The Marquess of Salisbury, K .G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Sub-enclosure. 30th June 1896. Memorandum from Mr. Stavrides. I have just received information from a trustworthy source in con nection with an incident which took place in the port of Kweit, in the Persian Gulf, which much disturbed and occupied the Palace within these last days. In supplying this information, I considered that it might be useful to preface it with a geographical and historical summary of the said country. Kweit, as you are probably aware, is a port of Arabia near Bussorah. Its soil is sandy and without any culture; the population of the town amounts to 50,000 souls. Its inhabitants are fishermen, generally both for fish and pearls, in the waters of Bahrein and Katar. Their trade is limited only to India, where they go and come in their boats. The province of Kweit, which depends upon the Governor of this town, is inhabited by nomads who are shepherds, and who can supply 100,000 warriors. The people of the town possess s. 33. a 24 Martini rifles, but those of the interior old-fashioned weapons and rifles. The governing family's name is Sabah, whieh is a branch of the family Entbe which reigns at Bahrein, and of which the reigning branch is named Khalifa. The title of the family in question is Cheikh. The country of Kweit, although entirely independent, figures in the maps as being a part of the Ottoman Empire, The reigning family possesses large landed property at Bussora, and especially at Eao, which belongs to them; that is the reason why the Cheikhs accept their investiture being sanctioned by the Sultan, who grants them the rank of Caimakan with the title of Pasha, of which the Cheikh does not deign to make use. The reigning family was composed of four brothers, one of whom named Abdullah died some time ago. His brother Mohammed suc ceeded him in the Government of Kweit, and, according to custom, his juniors, Jarrah and Moubarec, assisted him in the exercise of his powers. Lately, the two brothers Mohammed and Jarrah have been assassinated. The Palace received the information that Moubarec, after a month's residence at Boushir, kept by Her Majesty's Consul, Mr. Wilson, on his return killed his brothers because they objected to an alliance with the Emir Muhammed Ibu El Rachid, Cheikh of Chamar and suzerain of Nejd, and with Jacem ul Thamy, Sheikh of the tribes round Katar (town in the possession of the Turks, and depending on the Mutessarifat of Lahasa or Nejd, according to the Turks), and who some time ago massacred the Turkish garrison of Lahasa and maintains his independence since. According to the opinion of the Palace, this plan of alliance was suggested to Moubarec by the English Resident of Boushir, and that the object of such an alliance would be an Arabic confederation in which the principality of Bahrein would be comprised. The Palace, unwilling under the present circumstances to cause a new complication to arise, decided to ignore the case of the assassination, and intends to grant to Moubarec the usual investiture, and orders to this effect have been despatched to the Governor General of Bussora, instructing him to avoid all shedding of blood. 4 9,7 WWc ^ r ST ^ A^- ^ bt U, ^-cd. at INDO-EUROPEAN TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT. 7 W /i ^ Daily No. 00044 from ly No. mor.

His Excellency entirely concurred in my view as to the difficulty of obtaining the appointment of a Turco-Persian Commission which would only be increased by the fact that it was proposed to attach a British Officer to it. He considered the most practical method was to warn the Sheikh of Koweit that any renewal of such acts would bring upon him a very serious responsi bility. His Excellency added that he was speaking purely unofficially, and that if Her Majesty's Embassy wished for a definite and authoritative reply as to the appointment of a Commission, the matter must be laid before him in a Note Verbale. 5I do not, however, unless I receive instructions from Your Lordship to the contrary, propose to take any further action.
