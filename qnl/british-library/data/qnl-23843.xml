Dear Sir, I write to express the very sincere hope that we shall again this year have your assistance in connection with our annual Remembrance Day Appeal. to assist a greater number of cases of distress but also proves, in our opinion, that the Public has confidence in the Benevolent work which the Legion is carrying out amongst our less fortunate comrades and the Widows and Children of those who fell in the Great War. From 1921 to the present time the Remembrance Day Appeal and sale of Poppies has raised a sum of approximately five million pounds, of which Overseas Districts have contributed £627,837. 13. 2., a very magnificent sum, and for your share and that of your co-workers in this, and the generosity of all contributors in your District, I once again tender my very grateful thanks. The Remembrance Day Appeal provides the main income and enables over 4,000 voluntary Relief Committees (at work the whole year round), in this country and Overseas, to assist the most serious cases of distress, in addition to which, the Legion helps ex-Service men in their Pension difficulties, maintains a fine Sanatorium for the Tuberculous ex-Service man and assists blinded ex-Service men through St. Dunstan’s, which receives an annual Grant from the Poppy Day Collection. The Legion helps in numerous other ways, but the volume of its work and, therefore, its value, depends on the amount of the annual Remembrance Day Collection. Also in addition to the above Poppy Day provides perma nent employment in the British Legion Poppy Factory for 363 severely disabled ex-Service men who make the many millions of Poppies sold annually, thus carrying out a wish of our Founder-President, the late Field-Marshal Earl Haig, who frequently said that the finding of employment for disabled The full total for 1933 is not yet known but it has already exceeded that of 1932 by £20,000, a very satisfac tory increase which will not only enable the British Legion7 ex-Service men was as important as the raising of money. In the hope that we shall again have your help, I enclose the necessary requisition form on which to order supplies, and I shall he so glad if we may have this returned completed at your earliest convenience in order I also send an 'Information Slip' together with specimens of literature which you may find of interest.

Relief of Distress. 300,000 cases of ex-Service men in acute distress due to unemployment have been helped by the provision of food, coal, and clothing- through the Legion’s 3,692 honorary benevolent committees. A total of £237,839 was expended in this way during the year. In addition, certain Societies having no local organisation of their own use the benevolent machuiery of the Legion for the administration of their funds. Employment. 38,811 ex-Service pien (other ranks) and 950 dependants were found employment through the Legion’s Employ ment Department and voluntary Employment Committees. Another important angle of%he Legion’s employment work is the financing of approved schemespNi^iding work for ex-Service •fcen. Typical of such schemes are the British 'Legion Taxicab Drivers’ Training Scheme (98 placed in past year), Car Park Attendants Schemes (600 men now engaged), and the Cambrian Twe£d Factory in Wales. Others are in connection with such diverse forms of employment as coal-mining, tree felling, boot repairing, and fishing. In addition, 984 ex-Service men, during the past year, were set up in business on their own account at a cost of £17,498 in grants and interest free loans. Homeless ex*Service Men. Special centres are maintained for helping homeless and destitute ex-Service men. The London cen tre alone during 1933 assisted 12,085 of these men, the help given comprising 20,976 nights’ lodging, 62,820 meals, 111 travel vouchers, 558 cash grants and 1,414 clothing issues. Work for the Disabled. It has been the Legion’s constant aim to encourage and lacilitate the absorption of disabled men into industry. In its own Poppy Factory at Richmond, the British Legion is the largest employer of exclusively disabled labour in the country, 361 badly disabled ex-Service men being permanently employed there making the Poppies and Wreaths required for the annual Remembrance Day Appeal. Tuberculous ex*Service Men. The British Legion Village in Kent is recognised as one of the most important centres in the country for the treatment of tuberculosis, and has a population at the present time of over 900. It comprises Preston Hall .(the Sanatorium), a Training Centre where men may be taught a num ber of useful trades, and the Village Settlement where ex-patientslive with their families. The settlers are enabled to become self- supporting- by employment with British Legion Industries, which, during 1933, paid out in salaries and wages to settlers nearly £ 20 , 000 . Prince of Wales’ British Legion Pensions Fund. There are now 860 beneficiaries under this Scheme, which was inaugurated to provide weekly pensions of 10/- to ex-Service men and women of all ranks who, having attained the age of 50, have become prema turely aged as a result of hardships endured during service in the Great War. Blinded ex-Service Men. These war-sufferers, who particularly need our sympathy, are helped indirectly by the British Legion, by means of an annual grant (averaging £15,000) which is made to St. Dunstan’s from the proceeds of the Remembrance Day Appeal. • m Migration. Following the crisis in 1931 and the consequent closing down of migration schemes, the Legion’s work in this connection has of necessity been curtailed. In all, the Legion has assisted over 10,000 men, women and children to migrate to the Dominions. I he Legion’s Training Centre for Migrants is, however, being maintained Jii readiness to receive families when migration again opens up, and is being used for various purposes including a children’s holiday home during the summer months. Helping ex-Officers and their families. 39,017 cases were dealt with and 17,002 cash awards were made during 1933. 1,325 children of ex-Officers were educationally assisted at a cost of £30,932. £60,101 was expended in assisting ex-Officers, their wives and children. 1,300 pensions claims were dealt with, and legal assistance and advice was given to 170 ex-Otficers or their dependants. The Clothing Store was of immense value to ex- Officers and their families, but although well supported by gifts, did not adequately meet the demands made upon it. The Employ ment Bureau, which only operates in London, succeeded in placing 374 ex-Officers in employment. Housing. The Legion’s Housing Scheme continues to assist disabled married ex-Service men who are unable to secure other suitable accommodation at rentals within their means. This scheme now comprises 147 homes built in various parts of the country. The occupants pay moderate rentals. British Legion Central Sales. This organisation co-ordinates the sales activities of a number of industries employing mainly disabled ex-Service men. Goods to the value of £8,370 were sold during the past year, and much has been done to make better known the excellent craftsmanship of men disabled in the War. Th^ address of British Legion Central Sales is now DUCHESS HOUSE, 19, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road, London,, W. 1.UrilUh Legion Press, Preston Hall, Nr. Maidstone, Kent. Great War and other Pensioners. 4,035 pensions cases were dealt with during 1933. Since 1921 upwards of 65,000 cases have been officially represented before the Tribunals by the Legion’s Pensions Department. The work of this Department also includes the After-Care of War Orphans, and the organisation of a Blood Transfusion Service. Helping other Institutions. The British Legion Benevolent Committee is empowered to make financial grants to other Institu tions which assist ex-Service men. During the past year financial assistance has been given to St. Dunstan’s, King’s Roll Clerks’ Association, East Lancaslyre Tuberculosis Colony, Painted Fabrics, Spero Leather .Works, Deafened Ex-Service Men’s Fund, Ceylon Disabled Men’s Fund, Ashtead Potters, Ltd., Incorporated Association of Blind Ex-Service Men, and Others. 1 he Legion’s Bfanchcs. The total membership of the Legion in 1933 was 16,500 in excess of that of the previous year. *Its Branches numbered 3,994—129 more than in 1932. In addition, there is the Women’s Auxiliary, with Branches numbering 1,390. Each of these Branches is a self-contained unit working voluntarily for ex-Service men and their families. These very brief notes are cxti^cted from the Annual Report of the British Legion for the year 1932/3, a copy of which will be gladly sent on request. Finance. The bulk of the Legion’s income for benevolent purposes is derived from the annual Remembrance Day Appeal. This popular Appeal, while proving consistently successful for many years past, is but a slender support for a great work which must go on indefinitely. Bad weather on November 11th or other adverse factors might easily occasion a serious falling off of revenue. The Legion’s work has increased yearly since the organisation was founded by the late Field-Marshal Earl Haig in 1921, and practically every one of its many-sided activities is capable of useful extension, if funds permitted. It is essential therefore that the Legion should be fortified against any possible diminution of its income by increased annual donations and subscriptions, and contributors under this heading have the satis faction of knowing that they are assisting in the most practical way they possibly can to liquidate the Debt of Honour to those who suffer as a result of their services in the Great War. CONTRIBUTIONS and Legacies may, if desired, be earmarked for any branch of the Legion’s work. Remittances should be addressed to Captain W. G. Willcox, M.B.E., Organising Secre tary, Earl Haig’s British Legion Appeal, 26, Ecclcston Square, London, S.W. 1. Cheques, Money Orders and Postal Orders should be crossed BARCLAYS BANK.

In e Legion helps any ex-service lependant in a spirit of friendly sympathy and understanding, adjusting the power of helping to the need. The ways in which an ex-service ^an may suffer, and still remain outside the scope of official assistance, are many. Through unemployment, he and his family can suffer hunger and cold. Workless, he can be thoroughly fit to hold down a job if one were found for him. He could work up a successful one- man business had he the funds with which to start it. The tuberculous r and other severely disabled men have not all they want in a pension alone.' They ^would like to work; to be masters of a trade ; to be able to occupy their minds while supplementing their pensions, which after all are usually insufficient to maintain themselves and their families in decent comfort. r These are only a few of the many ways in which these men so often need help, but they all come within the very wide scope of the Legion’s work.r (.aaaxupsH koas axaMUM siiivxo ^oitaoxj RELIEF OF DISTRESS L&gt; ' 1933~Some of the year’s Work Last year 300,000 cases of acute distress di^ao unemployment were alleviated by the Legffvs 3,692 honorary benevolent committees, at a total cost of ^237,839.

At the close of 1933 no fewer than 860 weekly pensions of 10/- had been allotted. WORK FOR THE DISABLED • 362 severely disabled ex-Service men are per manently employed in, the British Legion Poppy Factory at Richmond, making the Ppppies and Wreaths required for the annual Remembrance ^ay Appeal.

The Legion’s Training Centre for Migrants is, however, being maintained in readiness to receive families when migration again opens up, and is being used for various purposes including a children’s holiday home during the summer months. Helping ex-OIficers and their families. 39,017 cases were dealt with and 17,002 cash awards were made during 1933. 1,325 children of ex-OHicers were educationally assisted at a cost of £30,932. £60,101 was expended in assisting ex-Officers, their wives and children. 1,300 pensions claims were dealt with, and legal assistance and advice was given to 170 ex-Ofhcers or their dependants. The Clothing Store was of immense value to ex- Olhcers and their families, but although well supported by gifts, did not adequately meet the demands made upon it. The Employ ment Bureau, which only operates in London, succeeded in placing 374 ex-Olficers in employment. Housing. The Legion’s Housing Scheme continues to assist disabled married ex-Service men who are unable to secure other suitable accommodation at rentals within their means. This scheme now comprises 147 homes built in various parts of the country. The occupants pay moderate rentals. British Legion Central Sales. This organisation co-ordinates the sales activities of a ifumber of industries employing mainly disabled ex-Service men. Goods to the value of £8,370 were sold during the past year, and much has been done to make better known the excellent craftsmanship of men disabled in the War. The address of British Legion Central Sales is now DUCHESS HOUSE, 19, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road, London. W. 1.British Legion Press, Preston Hall, Nr. Maidstone, Kent. Great War and other Pensioners. 4,035 pensions cases were dealt with during 1933. Since 1921 upwards of 65,000 cases have been officially represented before the I ribunals by the Legion s Pensions Department. The work of this Department also includes the After-Care of War Orphans, and the organisation of a Blood Transfusion Service. • Helping other Institutions. The British Legion Benevolent Committee is cm powered* to make financial grants to other Institu tions which assist ex-Service men. DuritTg the past year financial assistance has been given to St. Dunstan’s, King’s Roll Clerks’ Association, East Lancashire Tuberculosis Colony, Painted Fabrics, Spero Leather Works, Deafened Ex-Service Men’s Fund, Ceylon Disabled Men’s Fund, Ashtead Potters, Ltd., Incorporated Association of Blind Ex-Service Men, and others. • The Legion’s Branches. The total membership of the Legion in 1933 was 16,500 in excess of that of the previous year. Its Branches numbered 3,994—129 more.than in 1932. In addition, there is the Women’s Auxiliary, with Branches numbering 1,390. Each of these Branches is a self-contained unit working voluntarily for ex-Servicc men and their families. These very brief notes are extracted from the Annual Report of the British Legion for the year 1932/3, a copy of which will be gladly sent on request. Finance. The bulk of the Legion’s income for benevolent purposes is derived from the annual Remembrance Day Appeal. This popular Appeal, while proving consistently successful for many years past, is but a slender support for a great work which must go on indefinitely. Bad weather on November 11th or other adverse factors might easily occasion a serious falling off of revenue. I he Legion’s work has increased yearly since the organisation was founded by the late Field-Marshal Earl Haig' in 1921, and practically every one of its many-sided activities is capable of useful extension, if funds permitted. It is essential therefore that the Legion should be fortified against any possible diminution of its income by increased annual donations and subscriptions, and contributors under this heading have the satis faction of knowing that they are assisting in the most practical way they possibly can to liquidate the Debt of Honour to those who suffer as a result of their services in the Great War. CONTRIBUTIONS and Legacies may, if desired, be earmarked for any branch of the Legion’s work.* Remittances should be addressed to Captain W. G.

Typical of such schemes are the British Legion Taxicab Drivers’ Training Scheme (98 placed in past year), Car Park Attendants Schemes (600 men now engaged), and the Cambrian 1 weed Factory in Wales. Others are in connection with such diverse forms of employment as coal-mining, tree felling, boot repairing, and fishing.

A RECOMMENDATION. March, 1935. * In recent years there has been some uncertainty with regard to the particular Sunday in November upon which it is customary for Ministers to hold Services of Remembrance and to devote their colledions to Earl Haig’s British Legion Appeal for the purpose of assisting distressed ex-Service men and their families. We, the undersigned, therefore take pleasure in recalling and confirming that during the lifetime of the late Field'Marshal Earl Haig, whose great work for those who served in the War is so ably continued by the Fund bearing his name, it was agreed by the leaders of the various religious denominations that Remembrance Sunday should be observed on the Sunday immediately preceding the anniversary of Armistice Day, November 11th. The need for a greater revenue for Haig's Fund is vitally important as the increasing age of those who served in the War brings a corresponding increase in the calls for help, and accordingly we would strongly urge upon those in whose power lies the allocation of Remembrance Sunday colledions, that wherever possible, these might be appropriately and usefully devoted to further the beneficent work of the British Legion. * SO-* Archbishop of York. /*'h .tA-TCs Archbishop of Armagh.

Persian Gulf. 7th June, 1935. Dear Sir, Once more I write to ask for your very valuable assistance in connection with our Remembrance Day Appeal and sale of Poppies on behalf of distressed ex-Servicemen, their dependents and the widows and orphans. In spite of particularly bad weather in most parts of this country on Remembrance Day last year, the amount contributed is most satisfactory and while the full total of the collection is not yet known, as we are waiting for amounts from a few of the far distant Overseas places, there is little doubt we shall reach £500,000, an amount which will enable the Benevolent Committees of the British Legion to carry out a great deal of really necessary relief work amongst those ex-Servicemen and their families who are still in such need. ' v 1*' fyfc ^ In I have pleasure in enclosing a Gramophone Record of an appeal for help in connection with Remembrance Day made by H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, our Patron. I feel sure you will agree that this is a most striking appeal and should be of the greatest help in making known the needs of our Fund. There are, no doubt, many ways in which you will be able to use this apart from it being played in the home, it can, no doubt, be used to advantage wherever there is a gathering of people and in this country we are proposing to ask Cinema Proprietors and others dealing with entertainments to play it as often as pos sible during the period from 1st November to the 11th. This particular item is not noted on the pink requisition form enclosed, but if you would care to have a supply, we shall be glad to send you the number wished for, if you will mention same in your reply. I also enclose, for your information a leaflet which des cribes briefly the work carried out during the year 1934 and a further leaflet in connection with Church Collections signed by the Leaders of the various denominations. This has been specially prepared as there has been, recently, a doubt as toI? - 2 - /' w which should-he 'Remembrance Sunday' and also because we felt it possible to increase the amount contributed from Churches in this country at least, and it may be that a small supply of these would be useful to further your appeal for us, and if so, we shall be glad to send you the quantity needed; here again please let us know the number required as they do not appear as a separate item on the requisition form. I feel sure there is no need for me to remind you that there is the greatest possible need for a continuance of the work of this Fund. The Central Relief Department find that the demands made to them by their Committees tend to increase rather than decrease, partly because of the advancing age of Great War ex-ServIcemen and also largely due to unemployment, while other sections of our benevolent work, such as, Preston Hall, caring for the tubercular ex-Serviceman, is increasing in scope and usefulness, and The Prince of Wales British Legion Pension Fund has now nearly 1,500 pensioners and is jproving the greatest possible blessing to those who are so much in need. Generally speaking all the benevolent activities of the British Legion tend to grow rather than otherwise. In conclusion, I would like once again to assure you all of our gratitude for your past interest and generosity, and express the hope that we may again this year be favoured with a continu ance of your sympathy and practical support on Remembrance Day, November 11th next. P.S* I have not enclosed a requisition form, as I know you feel the sale of Poppies out of the question, but I feel perhaps you would like to see the specimens of leaflets and have at least one copy of the appeal made by ii.K.h.The Prince of Wales on a Gramophone Record - more will be sent with pleasure if required* Believe me.

Dear Sir, I write to express the very sincere hope that we may once again have your most valued assistance in the Remembrance Day Appeal and sale of Poppies on November 11th next for Haig’s Fund? You will, I am sure, be glad to know that the 1935 Appeal has been even more successful than the preceding years, which is not only a great encouragement to us in our work, but what is still more important, enables a greater amount of relief work to be carried out by the 3,787 voluntary local Benevolent Committees of the British Legion. The work of our Relief Committees tends rather to increase than diminish, mainly because of disablement, sick ness due to the strain of the War years, and the advancing age of ex-Service men and their dependants. The following brief extracts of benevolent work carried out during 1935 will, I think, interest you and, at the same time, convince you of the need for our work to continue The sum of £385,112 was spent on purely relief work amongst ex-Service men of all ranks, and dependants and widows and orphans of those who gave their lives in the Great War. The Prince of Wales British Legion Pensions Fund now gives weekly pensions of 10/- to over 1,500 prematurely aged ex-Service men and women. The Legion’s Employment organization found vacancies for nearly 50,000 ex-Service men. 595 War Orphans were helped by grants towards apprentice ships, training, special treatment, etc. At the London centre alone 12,182 homeless ex-Service men were given food and lodging.wmmmrnm - 2 - 904 ex-Service men were set up in 'business on their own account at a cost to the Legion of £17,465 in grants and interest-free loans. \ The British Legion Village in Kent, with a total population of 1,100, is the largest tuberculous com munity in the country. It comprises a Sanatorium, Training Centre and Industries and Village settlement. The British Legion Factory where the Poppies are made employs 367 severely disabled ex-Service men permanently. An annual grant of £15,000 is allocated to St. Dunstan’s from the proceeds of the Remembrance Day Appeal to assist War blinded ex-Service men. The above short particulars do not entirely cover the great beneficent work the Legion is carrying out, but are, I hope, sufficient to show how much work there is for our fund to do, and in the hope that you will again co-operate with us 1 enclose an Order Form which I should be glad if you will return completed as soon as possible so that we may pack and despatch your Poppies, etc,, in ample time. The supplies you will observe are much the same as usual, but I should call your attention to the Film and the Gramo phone Record. The first is now entirely out of stock and of the second only a very small supply remains. Leaflets - we have two kinds, one giving brief particulars of the benevolent work carried out during the previous year and the other is a recommendation that Church Collections should be taken for Haig’s Fund and is signed by the Leader of each denomination - please state clearly under item 15 of Order Form how many of each are required. In conclusion, may I again express the hope that we may have your continued assistance and say how exceedingly grate ful we are for all the interest and generous support accorded to us by residents in your part of the World. .

As President of the British Legion I realize that our bene volent work for the men who fought in the Great War on which there has been expended over £6,000,000 since 1921,’could never ^ have covered so wide and important a field had we not received the whole-hearted support of so many sympathisers who, like yourself have given such magnificent service to our Poppy Day Appeal. Unhappily there is no uiminution of the need of the men we serve although we are able to alleviate much suffering and distress, but, advancing age is a serious factor which cannot be dispelled and for some years to come we must anticipate still heavier claims upon our resources. Accordingly, while I thank you once again for your help to * may I express the very sincere hope that 1938 will find you ready and willing to renew to us the advantage of your very valuable support.

Thanks to the generous spirit in which British people have paid for their Poppies, the Legion, in the 16 years of its existence, has been able to build for itself an important and lasting place amongst the great benevo lent institutions of this Country. The watch word of its Members is “Service—not Self.” The Leg'ion has never attempted to assume what are rightly the responsibilities of the Government in compensating those who suffered in or because of their service in the War. Its function is to supplement the work of the Government; to help the many th^- ands who because they fall outside cei^Ri definite categories of disablement or distress cannot be helped officially ; to give assistance in the many ways for which no official pro vision is made. In short, the Legion helps any ex-Service man or dependant in a spirit of friendly sympathy and understanding, ad justing the power of helping to the need. y s- - y, !»THE WORK OF THE BRITISH LEGION FOR THE MEN OF THE GREAT WAR The British Legion was instituted in 1921 by the late Field-Marshal Earl Haig. Thanks to the generous spirit in which British people have paid for their Poppies, the Legion, in the 16 years of its existence, has been able to build for itself an important and lasting place amongst the great benevo lent institutions of this Country. The watch word of its Members is “Service—not Self.’’ The Leg'ion has never attempted to assume what are rightly the responsibilities of the Government in compensating those who suffered in or because of their service in the War. Its function is to supplement the work of the Government; to help the many th^- ands who because they fall outside cei^Pi definite categories of disablement or distress cannot be helped officially ; to give assistance in the many ways for which no official pro vision is made. In short, the Legion helps any ex-Service man or dependant in a spirit of friendly sympathy and understanding, ad justing the power of helping to the need. The ways in which an ex-Service man may suffer, and still remain outside the scope of official assistance, are many. Through un employment or sickness, he and his family can suffer hunger and cold. Workless, he can be thoroughly fit to hold down a job if one were found for him. He could work up a successful one-man business had he the funds with which to start it. The tuberc ulous and other severely disabled men have not all they want in a pension alone. They would like to work ; to be masters of a trade ; to be able to occupy their minds while supple menting their pensions, which after all are usually insufficient to maintain themselves and their families in decent comfort. These are only a few of the many ways in which these men so often need help, but they all come within the very wide scope of the Ltp^pn’s work. PLEASE HELP THE LEGION TO CARRY ON ITS GREAT WORK BY GIVING GENEROUSLY ON POPPY DAYI 1936—Some of the year s Work. RELIKF OF TEMPORARY DISTRESS Last year approximately 250,000 cases of acute distress due to unemployment and temporary illness were alleviated by the Legion’s 3,993 honorary benevolent committees, at a total cost of £215,711.

SETTING MEN UP IN BUSINESS During the year 727 unemployed ex-Service men were started in business on their own ac count by the expenditure of £15,816 in grants and interest-free loans. HELPING THE TUBERCULOUS MAN There is now a population approaching 1,000 in the British Legion Village near Maidstone, in Kent. The Village comprises a Sanatorium, a village settlement for ex-patients and their families, and a training centre where the settlers are taught and follow various trades, eventually- becoming self-supporting. The turnover of Preston Hall Industries for 1936 was in excess of £80,000. PENSIONS FOR THE PREMATURELY AGED The Prince of Wales British Legion Pension Fund was instituted in 1931 and provides small pensions for prematurely -aged ex-Service men and women. At the close of September, 1936 no fewer than 1,744 ex-Service men and women were receiving weekly pensions of 10/-. WORK FOR THE DISABLED 363 severely disabled ex-Service men are per- nj^mtly employed in the British Legion Poppy h ary at Richmond making the Poppies and Wreaths required for the annual Remembrance Day Appeal. At this Factory, the Legion is the largest employer of exclusively disabled labour in the world. ASSISTING EX-OFFICERS £65,188 was expended in assisting ex-officers, their wives and children. 935 children of ex-JL 1 I . . . officers were educationally assisted at a cost of £19,893. 1,836 pensions claims were dealt with by the Claims and Pensions Bureau, and legal advice and assistance was given to 200 ex officers and their dependants. The Clothing Store was again of immense value to ex-officers and their families. The Officers Employment Bureau, which only operates in London, suc ceeded in placing 491 ex-officers in employment. BLINDED EX-SERVICE MEN These war-sufferers, who particularly need our sympathy, are helped indirectly by the Legion by means of an annual grant of £15,000 which is made to St. Dunstan’s from the pro ceeds of the Remembrance Day Appeal. HOMELESS EX-SERVICE MEN In London a special centre is maintained for helping homeless ex-Service men. During 1936 10,451 of these men were assisted, the help given comprising 26,442 night’s lodging, 79,177 meals, 96 travel vouchers, 540 cash grants an(|f^6 clothing issues.

GREAT WAR and OTHER PENSIONERS 5,655 pensions cases were dealt with during 1936. Since 1921 upwards of 70,000 cases have been officially represented before the Tribunals by the Legion’s Pensions Department. The work of this Department also includes the After Care of War Orphans, and the organis ation of a Blood Transfusion Service. HELPING OTHER INSTITUTIONS The British Legion Benevolent Committee during 1936 granted £12,068 to other smaller institutions assisting the ex-Service community, this in addition to the grant made to St. Dunstan’s. THE LEGION’S MEMBERSHIP. AND BRANCHES The total membership of the Legion at the close of the last financial year was 17,949 in excess of that of the previous year. Its Branches numbered 4,207—77 more than in 1935. In ac^ii*&lt;4,on, there is the Women’s Auxiliary, with B ;hes numbering 1,637. Each of these Branches is a self-contained unit working volun- tarilv for ex-Service men and their families.

It is with the sincerest gratitude to all hardworking and enthusiastic organisers and helpers, and all generous subscribers, that I write to let you know that the 1937 Remembrance Day Appeal and sale of Poppies for Haig’s Fund for the benefit of disabled and distressed ex-Service men and their dependants has again beaten all its previous high records having secured the magnifi cent total of £550,993. 4. Od. As you will realise, this splendid sum will enable a still further extension of our much needed work of relief amongst the ever increasing number of War sufferers, for while the War is 20 years behind us many of those who fought are growing old and have become easy prey to the burdens of sickness and unemployment. The British Legion shoulders, as you know, the heaviest responsibility of all ex-Service Charities, and for this reason in repeating our thankfulness to you all for your past generous help I would renew our urgent desire for the same energetic and enthusiastic support in our 1938 Remembrance Day Appeal. With this hope in view I send herewith requisition formsfor completion and return at your earliest convenience, and I would ask you to carefully peruse these so that no type of Poppy you wish to have is overlooked and every item of advertising material we can supply (specially printed to meet all needs) is asked for. Please do not hesitate to indent for the quantities needed so that you may have no shortage, as we have ample stocks. I would particularly draw your attention to this year’s leaflet which I feel sure will he useful to your local Editors in the event of their being willing to write up the Poppy Day Appeal, as well as for general distribution. It is written by our President, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, and is headed 'How Poppy Day Helps' and it gives information which I think all those interested in our work will be glad to have. May I also mention that there is still room for extension of our Appeal through Church Collections. This appeal has the sympathetic support of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other Denominational Leaders y;ho have Joined in recommending to their Clergy that the collections taken on the Sunday preceding November 11th (this year November 6th), should be set aside for Haig’s Fund. I would ask that you will let us know, at your earliest con venience, that we are to again receive your valuable help, sending at the same time your indent for supplies, and in conclusion we send our best wishes to you all and again thank you for your interest in and practical support of our work.

In addition to providing work for the most deserving class of all—the disabled—every wreath sold helps to alleviate distress amongst ex-service men of all ranks, their dependants, and the widows of the fallen, for whose benefit the profits are applied. Several distinguished members of the Services who have died in recent years including Field Marshal Earl Haig, Admiral of the Fleet Earl Jellicoe, Admiral of the Fleet Earl Beatty, General Sir Webb Gillman and Major-General A. B. E. Gator, expressed the wish that wreaths given in their memory should be made at the Poppy Factory. The British Legion has its own organization for placing Poppy Wreaths on and photographing War Graves in France and Belgium, This section of the work is now dealt with separately in an illustrated booklet which we will gladly send on request. Please ask for OVERSEAS Catalogue. ■Some of the foliage used in the manufacture of these wreaths is not easily obtainable in large quantities, and in the event of a shortage it may be necessary to substitute one foliage for another.

While Haig Fund Poppy Wreaths may appropriately be used at all times of the year there is a particularly heavy demand for them at Armisticetide. Haig’s Fund is anxious to deal expeditiously with all orders received, and it will be of great assistance to this end if wreaths can be ordered and DELIVERY TAKEN as early as possible, thus relieving the pressure of work at Poppy Day Headquarters during the busy time and effecting a valuable saving of storage space at the British Legion Poppy Warehouse. POPPY DAY ORGANISERS AND BRANCHES who take a number of wreaths on “ sale or return ” are particularly asked to give their co-operation in this way. ORDERING AT HOLIDAY PERIODS. At holiday periods, such as Easter, Whitsun, etc., when the offices are closed for usual business, urgent orders should be sent by telephone or telegram to the British Legion Poppy Warehouse, 70 , York Road, King’s Cross, London, N.i.

PRESIDENT, BRITISH LEGIONHOW POPPY DAY HELPS I am often asked where the Poppy Day money goes, and why it is that we are always asking for more. The Government Pension funds provide pensions, on a scale varying with the degree of disablement, for those who were wounded in the War or whose break-down in health is directly attributable to War service, and it makes provision for the widows and orphans of men who died on service. The care of the men who fought for their Country and are in need either through unemployment or through a break down in health not directly attributable to War service, and the care of their dependants, is left to private benevolence, and by far the largest benevolent fund is that of the British Legion which is financed by the proceeds of Poppy Day. In 1936 the sale of Poppies and Church Collections in England, Wales, Ireland and Overseas (Scotland is separ ately administered) produced the splendid sum of £546,254, a record collection. Let us see where this money goes. First of all we have to provide the Poppies. Over thirty millions of these were made at the British Legion Poppy Factory in Richmond, and the cost of manufacture came to £77,300. Of course we could get these poppies cheaper if we put them out to contract, when they would probably be made by foreign or by child labour. Our Poppies cost rather more, because they keep an average of 400 badly disabled ex-Service men employed all the year round at good wages and working under pleasant and healthy conditions. In the rush period before Poppy Day the number employed often goes up to 450. A large number of the married men live in excellent flats id the grounds of Cardigan House, adjoining the Factory, an&lt;r a very happy community they are. Then there is the cost of the organisation of Poppy Day, of the staff, of printing and advertising, and of collecting and storing the poppies and finally of distributing them all over the world. That came to £20,000. I doubt if there is any other charitable organisation which collects over half-a- million of money, year after year, at a cost for administrative expenses of under 4 per cent.PY DAY HELPS the Poppy Day money goes, and s asking for more. 3n funds provide pensions, on a •ee of disablement, for those who or whose break-down in health is r service, and it makes provision of men who died on service. We can call these two figures, the cost of poppies and the cost of administration, £100,000, which leaves us with £446,000 to account for. By far the largest part of this, some £330,000, goes to necessitous cases through the 4,000 local benevolent committees of the Legion, which cover the country with a complete net-work. These committees deal with the normal forms of assistance to cases with which they are in direct touch and of which they have local knowledge. Local need is the main factor governing the amount of money which is allocated for relief work to each Committee. Fortu nately a large number of Committees do not need anything like the amount they collect on Poppy Day and this enables us to make distributions to the many poorer districts especi ally those in the distressed areas, where the collection is naturally small, far in excess of the amount collected locally. ) fought for their Country and are employment or through a break- attributable to War service, and ts, is left to private benevolence, wolent fund is that of the British r the proceeds of Poppy Day. &gt;ppies and Church Collections in md Overseas (Scotland is separ- d the splendid sum of £546,254, a ee where this money goes. provide the Poppies.

I doubt if there is any tion which collects over half-a- ' year, at a cost for administrative :nt. We now have £116,000 to account for. Of this, £35,000 goes to the Officers’ Benevolent Department. This depart ment deals with the claims of officers and their families. When it joined up with the British Legion, seventeen years ago, it had considerable invested funds which it is gradually using up. The grant from Poppy Day funds goes to reduce the rate at which capital is exhausted. Last year, despite this grant, the excess of expenditure over income amounted to £10,800, which means that capital was reduced by that amount. £15,000 a year goes to St. Dunstan’s to help that admir able organisation in its work for the blind. Of the remaining £66,000 we make an annual grant of £20,000 a year to the Prince of Wales’ British Legion Pension Fund, which, with this grant and the income from its capital, maintains about 2,000 pensions of ten shillings a week to men who are 50 years old or over, have done good war service, are broken in health and are not entitled to any other form of pension. £12,000 goes to finance the employment department and its agents, who last year found some 40,000 jobs. £4,700 is the cost of the Pensions Department, which last year dealt with 5,629 claims and secured for Pensioners £11,000 of arrears of pensions and new pensions to the value of £8,000. £4,000 goes to the British Legion Village, Preston Hall, in Kent, where we maintain a sanatorium for tubercular ex- Service men, and a complete village settlement, with work shops, village hall, shop, post office and school, and a total population of over 1,000 persons.£9,000 goes in grants to other societies working for ex- Service men, not incorporated in the Legion, and £1,000 to Burnham Hall which is run by the Women’s Section of the Legion for the training of widows and other female depen dants of ex-Service men in domestic work. This leaves £15,300, which, with some £20,000 which is raised by the Appeal Department of the Legion in addition to Poppy Day money, is used for a number of smaller schemes of help and towards the cost of general administration. The whole of this is set out in detail in the Accounts attached to our Annual Report. But I am now dealing only with Poppy Day money. Now to answer the question—why do we want more? When the War ended the Government created a fund out of the profits made by the Canteens, with a capital of some £7,000,000. This fund is called the United Services Fund. It works in the closest co-operation with the Legion which has a majority on the governing body. It used to deal with all cases of help to sick and convalescent ex-Service men, and with all forms of help to their families. This Fund is ap proaching exhaustion and more and more of its work has now to be financed from Poppy Day. Further, owing to the increasing age of ex-Service men, the number of cases of chronic sickness is steadily increasing and these cases cannot be dealt with adequately by temporary assistance. We have a long waiting list of men in every way eligible for Prince of Wales’ pensions, but have not the funds to increase the number of pensions. It is repulsive to us, and I am sure to you, that men who have done good service for their country in the field should have to go to Public Assistance Committees for the means to maintain existence. We are endeavouring J;o enable you to keep the promises made to these men, when they joined up, and to do that we want all that you can give us. Remember the size of our problem. The Regular Navy, Army and Air Force, number^k in time of peace some 400,000 men. Six millions fought for you in those Services in the War, and the Legion seeks to help all of those who are in need, whether they are members of the Legion or not.

Dear Sir, I am anxious that you should know how much I valued the help you gave to the 1938 Remembrance Day Appeal for Haig’s Fund, and on behalf of those who will benefit because of your practical sympathy, I wish to express to you my very grateful thanks. I am relieved and thankful in the knowledge that the British Legion’s coffers are once again replenished, and that the Legion’s benevolent work may go on, unhampered by lack of funds, for yet another year. Knowing, as I do, the vast amount of need still existing amongst ex-Service men and'their families, need which it seems certain must continue for many years to come, my gratitude goes out to the memory of the late Earl Haig to whose keen foresight we owe the idea of Poppy Day with its power for good, and I derive the greatest encouragement from the support of so many thousands of friends who, like your self, give so unselfishly of their time and energies to the great National Appeal which the Field Marshal founded.

This very welcome contribution provides the clearest possible proof that the sacrifices of the Great War, even after the passing of twenty years, are still remembered gratefully by our good friends in your part of the world, and the generosity with which Poppies have been bought is, I can assure you, of the greatest encouragement to the British Legion in its work for still another year. I shall be glad if you can find some means of expressing our gra titude to all who have supported our Appeal so generously, and that you will at the same time assure these valued supporters that their practical sympathy will be the means of bringing ad^ed comfort and happiness into the homes of those who fought in the Great War. May I, in conclusion, express my own very sincere thanks to you and your helpers for the important work of organisation which you have so ably carried out.

H.B.M*s.Political Agent* Political Agency* BAHRAIN. Persian Gulf* 2nd June, 1939. Dear Sir* The 1938 Remembrance Day Appeal for Haig’s Fund produced the splendid total of £575&gt;000, a new and quite outstanding record, and I am sure this good news will cheer _you quite as much as it has done the people at home. Our gratitude for this marvellous result is due to all workers for the Fund, and especially do we thank our friends overseas who again so generously shewed their sympathy for the men of the Great War. Thanks to the greater revenue available, it has been possible for us again to extend our benevolent work and I am sure you will understand what a blessing this has been to ex-Servicemen and their families. Many thousands more during the past year, owing to increasing age, sickness or prevailing conditions, have lost the security of employment, and for the first time in previously active lives have been compelled to ask the aid of others. The present difficult conditions throughout the World, which affect us all in various ways, have imposed great hardships on the now ageing men of the Great War. Many industries and trades in which these men have been employed have been seriously affected by the recent months of tension, and staff reductions have been- 2 - only too general. While it is true that rearmament schemes have provided new employment for many thousands, only a small number of Great War men have benefited, since for the main part the younger men who saw no service are chosen, because they are younger, stronger and more active. So it is that while we rejoice in the splendid record in which you shared last Poppy Day, we must face the fact that our income has not yet drawn level with our financial needs, and do all possible to ensure still more outstanding Poppy Day records in 1939 and future years. I earnestly hope that I may again look forwarI to your valuable support in organising our Remembrance Day Appeal amongst Britons in your part of the World. I can assure you that your renewed co-operation means a very great deal to the Fund and to the men it serves. In this hope, I am enclosing the usual order form for Poppies and other supplies, and would ask you to be so very kind as to complete and return this to me as soon as you possibly can, when I will arrange for early shipment to be made. You will perhaps be interested to see the advance copy of our 1939 Poppy Day leaflet which also accompanies this letter. It gives a brief summary of some of the principal angles of our work - but enough, I am confident, to convince you how very real is the need of the Great War ex-Servicemen here at home, and how important to these men and their families is the continued practical sympathy and generosity of British people in all parts of the World. I hope I may hear, at an early date, of your intention j;o help us again, and in sending my renewed thanks for your support ^n past years I would like to add my very best wishes to you and all other friends who have co-operated in the good work* Organizing Secretary, Appeals Dept*,BRITISH LEGION,B y giving generously for your Poppy on Remembrance Day you are sharing in the GREATEST OF ALL NATIONAL VOLUN TARY EFFORTS to help those who fought in their Cou nt ry’s service.II i\ Ji i BRITISH LEGION Patron: HIS MAJESTY THE KING. THOSE IN DISTRESS. Over 4,000 honorary committees are constantly at work alleviating distress in ex-Service homes ravaged by unemployment. The help given is mainly in the form of vouchers which can be exchanged for meat, groceries, coal, clothing and other necessaries. Tradesmen’s bills paid during 1938 totalled £209,071. In addition £10,127 was spent in direct cash grants, and £9,421 on the relief of distress amongst ex-Service men living overseas. THE SICK. The number of cases of chronic sickness amongst ex-Service men is steadily growing. Additional comforts for cases of this type cost £40,277 during 19^j^ while £5,600 was expended on regular weekly allowances for permanently incapacitate ex-Service men. Special medical and convalescent treatment called for the expenditure of £24,565. These are sections of the Legion’s work which must inevitably increase as the men of the Great War grow older. THE TUBERCULOUS. There is a population of 1,100 in the British Legion Village for tuberculous ex-Service men in Kent and its seaside annexe at Bournemouth. It is the largest unit in the country for the treatment of tuberculosis. The Sanatorium has 418 beds. Patients who are strong enough can learn and follow a trade in the Village Industries, which also offers a livelihood to the ex-patients who live with their families, under medical supervision, in the Village Settlement. The turnover of the Village Industries during 1938 amounted to £76,557. THE LIMBLESS. The British Legion permanently employs 400 badly disabled ex-Service men (mainly limb cases) in its Poppy Factory at Richmond. It is the world’s largest workshop employing only war-disabled men. Here are made the huge quantities of poppies and poppy wreaths needed for Remembrance Day. A large number of the disabled workers, for whom travelling offers an almost insuperable obstacle, live with their families in modern flats built by the Legion within the Factory estate. THE PREMATURELY AGED. The Legion has a Pension Fund for prematurely aged ex-Service men of 50 years and over who served overseas in the Great War. At the close of 1938 no fewer than 2,010 deserving cases were being assisted by a regular weekly pension of 10/-, at a total annual cost of £52,260. The scheme does not overlap with the various forms of public assistance, and is specially designed to tide prematurely aged men over the difficult period until they become entitled to the State Old Age Pension. THE CHILDREN. Young children are only too often the innocent victims of the distress suffered by fathers who served in the War. While most Legion schemes of assistance indirectly benefit the children, there are various direct forms of help such as educational assistance, obtained through the United Services Fund, costing £20,298 in 1938, boarding charges £7,448, after-care £2,020 and orphaned children £560. These figures refer to children of ex-Service men other than officers, the family work for wh^m is outlined in another section. THE HOMELESS. The British Legion has a special centre in London, to help such men as various circumstances have rendered homeless. During 1938 no fewer than 9,042 cases were assisted by the provision of food and lodging, travel warrants, cash grants, tools or clothing. These details are extracted from the BRITISH LEGION ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS, copies Libraries and Reading Rooms throughout the country. Copies are als I {Some of the past year’s work. HOUSING. Apart from the special housing facilities which the British Legion offers to disabled ex-Service men at its Richmond Poppy Factory and in the British Legion Village in Kent, there is a general housing scheme for disabled married men. This comprises 153 homes, built by the Legion at a cost of £75,000, situated in groups in different parts of the country. Free occupation is not given, the tenants paying a nominal rental which covers the Legion’s outgoings. THOSE WITHOUT WORK. To place Great War men in employment is becoming g^ith their advancing age, an increasingly difficult problem, but in spite of many Thculties, the Legion during 1938 found work for 33,101 ex-Service men and 2,669 dependants. In addition, 61 more men were trained as taxi-cab drivers, making 797 in all, while by the provision of £11,007 in interest free loans and £2,640 in grants, 620 men were started in business on their own account. £981 was spent on fares and £3,585 on removal grants to enable unemployed men to take up work in other districts. After careful investigation £2,129 was advanced in loans and grants to nine enterprises promoted to employ ex-Service men. THE BLIND. These pitiful cases are indirectly assisted by the British Legion by means of a regular annual grant of £15,000 which is made to St. Dunstan’s from the income from the annual Remembrance Day Appeal. £500 was also allocated in 1938 to the fund instituted by Sir Beachcroft Towse to help ex-Service men who became blind after service. SPECIAL NEEDS. The Legion’s help is asked in a hundred and one different forms; all important and all within reason, dealt with under one or another of the schemes of assistance. Of this miscellany of ex-Service men’s need, mention might be made of the provision of surgical appliances which cost £5,768 in 1938, and dental treatment costing £7,912. Help given during the year in connection with the funerals of 1,608 Great War ex-Service men, whose dependants w r ere in poor circumstances, cost £7,915. EX-OFFICERS. The assistance given to ex-officers and their families by the Officers’ Association, which acts as the Officers’ Benevolent Department of the Legion, amounted during 1938 to over £85,000, 41,000 cases being dealt with during that period. £14,369 was granted to disabled ex-officers, £36,301 to non-disabled officers, £11,787 to widows and dependants, while children of ex-officers were educationally assisted at a cost of £21,518, and £1,200 was paid to the Housing Association for Officers’ Families. Other work during the year, unimportant financially but otherwise illuminating, because it indicates so clearly the degree of need existing, was the issue of clothing outfits to 1,729 ex-officers, and the placing in employment of 546 ex-officers. THE LEGION'S BRANCHES. Throughout England, Ireland, Wales and Over seas, the Legion has 6,102 Branches, of which 4,367 are Men’s and 1,735 Women’s, ^^ch is a voluntary unit ably and gladly co-operating with the British Legion Head quarters to bring comfort, comradeship and hope into the homes of disabled and otherwise necessitous ex-Service men of the Great War. Here perhaps it is appropriate to mention that Branches and Clubs of the Legion are financially self-contained, and are not assisted in any way from funds which are publicly subscribed to the British Legion for benevolent purposes. ies of which are sent to the Press, to all Members of Parliament, to the leading Clubs, Public also available to members of the public, post free on application./ PLEASE BE VERY GENEROUS on Remembrance Day The beneficent work of the British Legion for Great War ex-Service men and their families goes on unceasingly for 365 days in each year. It is financed by the income from the one- day sale of Haig Fund Poppies on November 1 1th. The work is always increasing, for the men of the Great War are growing older. Many more each year are becoming the helpless victims of chronic sickness and unemployment, pitiful handicaps which are only too often the accompaniment of advancing years. The British Legion is determined that there shall be no diminution of its work: that at no time shall it be necessary to refuse help to a really deserving case; but to ensure this it needs and earn estly asks your most generous co-operation. Please give more generously than ever before for the emblem of remembrance you will wear on Remembrance Day, 1 939. 3* AC AC ' i POPPY DAY TOTALS YEAR BY YEAR. 1921 £ 106,000 1930 ^524,650 1922 £158,307 1931 £501,082 1923 ^203,364 1932 ^'483,298 1924 ^272,426 1933 £511,853 1925 £338,560 1934 ^505,628 1926 £360,256 1935 ^527,302 1927 £442,326 • 1936 ^544,301 1928 £503,348 1937 ^553,103 1929 ^518,489 1938 ,£*575,000 AC AC AC PLEASE HELP TO MAKE 1939 A RECORD YEAR. k Issued by HAIG’S FUND 29, Cromwell Road, London, S.W.7../ 5*7 -16/48.

I can assure you that our annual Poppy Day Appeal has been a real blessing to those who gave such faithful service to the Snpire in the years of war. Over eight million pounds has been contributed since 1921, and you may have my assurance not only that this great sum of money has been carefully and wisely administered on behalf of the donors, but that it has in the past 18 years brought comfort and happiness into thousands upon thousands of ex- Service homes where poverty and the lack of employment had brought only hopelessness and despair.

Sep Dear Sir, Since writing you about this year f s Remembrance Day Appeal and sale of Poppies War has intervened and I think it wise to lot you know that The Council of the British .Legion has unanimously decided that the beneficent work on behalf of Great War ex-Service men and their dependants, v/hich it has carried out during the past 17 years, shall be immediately extended to include all ranks and all Services now serving or who will be serving in the present emergency, and that it is most vital that we proceed with the national organization of Poppy Day. We in England are not yet in a position to appreciate fully the difficulties that may lie in the way of the normal organization of Poppy Day and to what extent such difficulties might affect adversely the financial result of the Appeal, but we are confident that we shall be able to rely on all Britons Overseas to give us the utmost support. The need is great now. It will be much greater in the days to come and we have to ensure that ample funus are provided to cope adequately, not only with the men of 1914-1918. but also their sons who are fighting to-day. The Poppies ordered by Mrs.Dalrymple Belgrave. have been packed in one case which will be brought out, freight free, by the kindness of Messrs.F.C.Strick &amp; Co.Ltd., per one of their vessels which they hope will sail shortly and I hopo to be able to send you necessary Free Parcel Receipt in early course. May I assure you that Haig's Fund has always appreciated the magnificent practical support received from friends Overseas and add that Haig's Fund is relying, more than ever now, on the help of all friends in your part of the World and I earnestly hope that should there be local difficulties, which cannot be overcome, which make your usual Appeal impossible, that you will immediately put in hand preparations for an Appeal of another order?

Persian Gulf* Dear Sir, Because of the present delay in communications between London and Overseas I am writing to you about Poppy Day rather earlier than usual and hope very sincerely that I may count once again on your sympathetic support to this greatest of all efforts on behalf of those who have suffered, physically or economically, in their Country^ Service* We are looking to #he future with great anxiety. For many years now it has been a real problem for my Council to make the income of our one day Appeal, generous as it has been, serve to finance the Legion* s many sided work, day in and day out, for the whole of the year. But this most difficult problem has in most years been overcome by means of careful planning of our schemes of assistance, careful but sympathetic investigation of all claims ^ and above all by rigid economies in administration. The new War,however, has necessarily changed our financial outlook. We have still to help the men of the Great War and their families. This is an obligation we must always honour. But in addition we have undertaken to make all our schemes of assistance available to the men serving in this War when they too become Ex- Service men, and the time is rapidly approaching when the claims from this new category of Ex-Service man will assume serious proportions. We have to keep in mind the fact that every man who serves in the present*emergency is a potential Ex-Service man who may eventually need the help of the Legion. Nor must we forget when we are considering our future financial position, the decrease in the purchasing power of the pound sterling. Thus it is clear that we must look forward in the near future to what may prove to be a doubled financial need, and our Poppy Day Appeal therefore becomes of greater importance than ever before. We are only too well aware how generously our friends Over seas have supported the work of the British Legion on Poppy Day. We know too of the many additional calls which have been made on them in recent months by other well-known Appeals which are helping men who are actually serving. We feel certain, however, that you and indeed all our good friends in Bahrain will appreciate the Nation*s 27th March, 1940. v WAR INCREASES OUR RESPONSIBILITIES* ' 1 .OU . ..

SURREY. 20 th / Feb. / 1941/ The 1940 Poppy Day Appeal (our second during the present War) has proved remarkably successful in spite of all the difficulties, thanks to the splendid efforts made by all our voluntary workers and I am sure you will agree that to have raised an amount of £545»000 (to-date) is a very great achievement of which all our helpers may be justly proud and is one which speaks highly for the care and thoroughness of all our district organisations, both large and small, and particularly for the sympathetic generosity of all subscribers throughout the World. I write at this early date, on account of delays in post and shipping, to ask for a renewal of your most valuable co-operation in this year’s Remembrance Day Appeal (November 11th) and to say how warmly we shall appreciate the continuance of the generous contributions from our friends in Bahrain. You will, I am sure, forgive me for reminding you that our need for a larger income is now much greater as our benevolent work which, for 20 years has been carried on to help men of the Great War, is now extended to include the men and women (and their dependants) of this present War of all three Services, the Merchant Navy and Members of the various Women’s Auxiliary Services. We have given a good deal of thought to the question of distributing overseas supplies during war-time as we have found that several shipments did not arrive in time for the 1940 collection and, in one or two instances, it was impossible to find space on a particular ship. Shipping Companies, as you know, have always very generously carried our Poppies freight free but it is a question as to whether we should ask for this concession in these difficult times, and again, as to whether, when space is needed for other essentials, we are justified in asking them to carry Poppies also, having in mind, the risk of possible loss in transit.The Political Agent. 2 20th February, 1941* These points are raised for your consideration and a form for ordering supplies is enclosed in case you consider Haig’s Poppies are essential, in which case, if you will send your order as soon as possible, we will do our utmost at this end to despatch with the least possible delay. J As an alternative, and purely as a war-time measure, | you would perhaps consider the possibility of obtaining | Poppies locally, or use a suitable paper emblem,and, whichever method you decide upon I should be glad to hear at your I early convenience. having brought to your notice when writing in regard to the 1940 Poppy Day Appeal, it is the fact that, owing to the shortage of paper, no 1939 Poppy Day Report was published and the publication of such reports will be discontinued, for the time being, at anyrate. Headquarters, as do all the people of Britiain, realise and admire the magnificent way in which Britishers Overseas have and are responding to Appeals of National importance to our War effort, and your sympathetic and generous support of our own work, in spite of these many other calls, is all the more deeply appreciated, but I do ask you to keep our work before you and continue to give as generously as you can so that the British Legion may be able to carry on now and also help to safeguard the future of those who are serving their Country in its hour of need. from you in connection with our Appeal this year, and in the meantime renew the deep gratitude of Haig’s Fund and the British Legion for your past generosity and s t ympathy.

I enclose herewith the copy of a letter I have written to-day to the Organising Secretary, Earl Haig’s British Legion Appeal, in order to explain to you the position regarding the case of poppies sent out to you from the U.K. some time ago. It is most unfortunate that the case has gone astray, but if it does not turn up within the next month or so, and you are unable to make your own arrangements, perhaps we in Basrah wtll^be able to help ypu either by sending you some ready-made poppies or red crepe paper from which you can have the poppies made. In this connection please let me know, roughly, how many poppies you think you would require. I I shall at once inform you if I have any further news of the missing case of poppies. Yours very truly, C .A.Munro.\ c/o L^lacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company, Post Box No#36, BASRAH IRAQ. 8th September, 1943 The Organising Secretary, ■''ISarl Haig*s British Legion Appeal, Cardigan House, x Richmond, SURREY. Dear Sir, I have to advise you that I have been appointed by the British Community Council, Basrah, as the council member responsible for the organisation of the 1943 Remembrance Day Appeal in the Basrah area, and I therefore acknowledge receipt of your airgraphs of March 22nd and July 7th, and also your airmail letter of April 10th enclosing Bill of lading No.16. Your airmail letter of the 19th March has not been received so far. I regret to inform you that the case of poppies you sent out by sea for the Political Agent, Bahrein, has somehow gone astray and has not been received here. Your letter of April 10th, enclosing the relative Bill of Lading, arrived some considerable time after the ship had completed discharging and left Basrah on July 2nd, and no trace of the case could be found when I went to take delivery of same immediately after receiving the Bill of Lading The ship's and the Port Directorate's tally slips have been very carefully checked but there is no record that the case had been landed, and eventually on August 3rd the Port Directorate issued a 'Short-Landed Certificate' to the Community Council, Basrah. remainder of her cargo, but despite a most careful and prolonged search on the part of Messrs. Strick and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the case could not be found at Abadan either, and Messrs. Strick now confirm definitely that the case was short-landed. I think it is quite likely that the case of poppies was inadvertently mixed up and discharged with military cargo at Basrah, and at the present time, at my request, the military authorities here are conducting a search for it. This must needs take some time since the military cargo received ex the ship has by this time been distributed all over the country, but I think there is a hope that the case may eventually be found. If it does turn up there will be no difficulty for me to arrange to forward it to Bahrein without delay. being sent in the consular bag by airmail, so it should reach you quickly./ The ship proceeded from Basrah to Abadan to discharge the This letter, by the kindness of our Consul in Basrah, is-* ' &lt;p /^o quickly. If you consider it necessary, I would suggest that you approach the consular authorities in the Foreign Office, London, with a view to getting permission to send out a small package of poppies, small size, in the consular airmail hag addressed either ^-to the British Consul in Basrah or the Political Agent, Bahrein. In the meantime I slall write to the Political Agent, Bahrein, to-day and send him a copy of this letter to inform of him of the position, and it is possible that if the case does net turn up I may be able to arrange to send him some of the poppies we have in hand in Basrah, since it is most likely that this year much fewer poppies will be required in Basrah than was the case last year, since conditions here have altered considerably during the past few months. I have not yet had an opportunity to check over what stocks of poppies etc. we have in Basrah but I am quite sure that we have an ample supply. For your information I may add that airgraphs from the U.K. to Basrah take roughly between a fortnight and three weeks as a rule, but airmail letters take anything between two and three months to reach us. The same applies, I believe, to letters and airgraphs from Basrah to the U.K. Copy to:- Yours very truly, C.A.Munro • The Political Agent, Bahrein. /4 c/o IfecAndrews &amp; Forbes Post Box BASRAl!.

Dear Sir, 7? urther to my letter of the 8th inst., I am now pleased to inform you that the military authorities have been able to trace the missing case of poppies consigned to Bahrein. I understand that the case was discharged as military cai^go, unknown to Messrs. Strick apparently, and was forwarded by the military to Bahrein on the 2Cth August. I have not yet been advised that the case has actually arrived at Jahpein, but expect to have a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrein, in this connection within the next week or so. In the meantime please cancel my previous suggestion that a package of poppies be sent out to Bahrein by airmail, and unless you hear from me to the contrary you may take it that the case of poppies has safely arrived at Bahrein.

A Billion pounds may seem to be a very large amount of money to collect in one day, but it is a modest sum when considered in relation to the millions of men and women now serving, and the magnitude of the work which the British legion will have to carry out for so many of them at and after the end f \ of the T :/ar. £ 180 , 000 . or 22 per cent, but given really first-class organiza tion we shall succeed.

I do not think that any money so spent could bring happier returns.

Dear Sir, A very little time seems to have elapsed since I expressed the very sincere thanks of Haig 1 s Fund to our friends in your part of the V/orld for their generous gift to Poppy Day 1943. and to you, and your helpers, for your grand job of organization but, taking into consideration the time we must allow for corres ponding with each other. Poppy Day 1944 will soon be approaching and so I write to ask for your co-operation in the organization of this Appeal and for the usual generous contributions of all our good friends in Bahrein. ’Ve are all aware of the Debt we owe to our Fighting Forces and are always seeking practical ways and moans of expressing our admiration and gratitude for what they have done and will do to bring us Victory and peace. It is to assist these men and women to meet the difficulties which many will have to aface on their return to civilian life, to help lighten the burden of the disabled, and to aid the dependants of those who have made the supreme sacrifice, that we ask for your continued help and generosity and, from our experience in the past, we know we shall not ask in vain. ’Yifc h regard to sending poppies and advertising material the * position as you know has altered very little and we would ask you \ still to procure poppies, or a cardboard replica, locally, or if 1 this is out of the question to organize some other form of Appeal 1 suitable to local conditions. If,however, you really feel our J poppies etc., should be supplied and you will let us have your I requirements by return we, at this end, will do our best to get l them out to you but cannot, of course, guarantee this can be done. I Our final total for poppy Day 1943 has not yet been reached but I know your pleasure will be as great as ours when I tell you that we have received to-daate the splendid total of £920,000. and l would take this opportunity of recording our sincere gratitude and thanks to our many friends of all nationalities, allied and neutral, who have contributed with such conspicuous generosity, and I shall not fail to let you have the final figure when it is known. and in sending you our best wishes for even greater success in your organizing efforts would ask for the renewed generosity of all our friends in Bahrein to enable us to help to the utmost those men and woaan who are doing so much. please write me to confirm your continued valuable support Believe me Yours very truly.

We were perhaps a little too optimistic in setting our 1943 target at ONE MILLION POUNDS hut this magnificent result would seem to prove that we ought to he able to achieve our object this year.

We all know and appreciate the magnificent efforts and sacrifices those men and women are making for us and I am sure this knowledge and your gratitude to them all will spur you to still greater feats of organisation and generous giving. Much of the success which attended our 1943 Appeal in this country was due to the arranging of special functions throughout Remembrance Week (November 5th to 11th).

The papers cover subscriptions collected and coordinated by the Political Agency, and from 1938, the sale of poppies in Bahrain, usually undertaken by the wives of British officials. The file’s principal correspondents are: the Political Agent in Bahrain (numerous incumbents); the British Legion (Organising Secretary Captain W G Willcox, and President of the Legion, Sir Frederick Barton Maurice); and Lady Marjorie Lepel Belgrave, wife of Charles Dalrymple Belgrave.The file contains a range of printed materials, published by the British Legion, including:leaflets promoting the Legion’s work and its campaigns (ff 9-10, ff 12-15, ff 21-27, f 41, ff 76-79, ff 99-100, ff 117-118);an annual report of accounts for the British Legion for 1934 (ff 39-40);Haig Fund poppy wreath catalogues (f 98, ff 101-102).A letter from the Political Agent (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch) to the Organising Secretary of the British Legion, dated 12 January 1938 (f 91) notes that it had ‘hitherto been regarded as undesirable that Poppies should be sold in Bahrain. Such objections as there may have been no longer [exist]; and I shall hope to receive Poppies from you in future.’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Marjorie Lepel Belgrave</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>The Royal British Legion</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Charities</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fundraising</topic></subject><subject><topic>Remembrance day (UK)</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000125#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
