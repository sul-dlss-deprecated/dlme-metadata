From Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I* 0 T^be Secretary to tbe Government of India in tbe Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of a commu- No. 41-C., dated the 24th November 1905 . uication received from His Britannic , . , . Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas in which he inquires whether it would not be possible for the Heniam Cable, a ter being landed at Bunder Abbas, to be taken through the new British Consulate (m front of which it will be landed), before going on to the Persian Utface and terminus in Bunder Abbas Town. . understand Lieutenant Shakespear to suggest that the British signaller and office might be located in our new Consulate. . Such an arrangement could only work satisfactorily from our point of View, if the British signaller had complete control of the Cable and could stop messages going on to the Persian Office. Had he such control, the Persian signaller would only be able to receive or despatch a message after being placed in connection ’ by the British signaller. Such an arrangement would certainly be convenient to us, but I do not see how it could be claimed from the wording of Article 4 of the agreement of 13th May 1905, nor does it seem to be one which the Persian Government would be likely to accept. As neither of the contracting parties would presumably agree formally to its signaller being practically at the mercy of the other, which must be the case if the signallers are located a distance apart, and it seems necessary that they should be together or in adjoining rooms, from which they can personally communicate with one another. 3. The above are my personal views, as I understand the position, but it seems desirable to submit Lieutenant Shakespear’s report for the information of Government; and in any case, it would no doubt be convenient if the Consulate were connected with the Town Office just as the Subzabad Residency (in the case of Bushire) is connected with the Reshire Telegraph Office, the Residency Clerks being, as far as possible, trained signallers. No. 41-C., dated Bunder Abbas, tbe 24th October 1905. From— -Lieutenant W. H. I. Sbakespeab, I.A., Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bunder Abbas, To-—Tbe Political Resident in tbe Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty's Consul General for Fars, Khuzistan, etc,, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to this Consulate diary entries for the 16th and 17th October 1905, regarding the new telegraph connection to Bander Abbas. 2. The shore-end of the cable w T as landed at a spot east of the town and directly in front of the site of the proposed new Consulate; in fact, within a few yards of the place I had selected for the site of the boat-house of the Consulate, and it is at this spot that the cable-house will eventually be built. The Director, Persian Gulf Section, Telegraph Department, selected the spot on its merits as the best calculated to avoid interference of the cable with the anchorage and for other departmental reasons. 3. From the correspondence which was forwarded under your No. 1131, dated the 9th August 1905, for my perusal, it would appear that the line is an entirely Persian one with only a Persian Office at Bunder Abbas, Under these circumstances the Telegraph Office will certainly be located in the town and probably somewffiere near the present Customs Office in the centre of the town’s business quarter. I quite agree that this will be the most advantageous place for the office. 4. At the same time I recollect that the British Government reserved to itself the right of having messages to and from the Consulate worked by a British signaller. Before work on the line, Cable-houses, offices, etc., is com-' pleted (which I understand from the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, will„i. months) I n—™ TSSilgf.ta 5ri:S'”r.K h? P :3«^^ have control of the line, whilst wi » ta ” ever y message to and from fC l ctE’r'-fV” b ”“' “ 1 nkn show that the expense involved is infinitesimal. Being a cable line I imagine that some testing will have to be continually done, and there seems little objection on this score alone, that the line should come first to the Consulate, where the necessary delicate instruments, etc., would undoubtedly be better safeguarded and whence the general efficiency of the line could be better maintained. v , 5. I would make it clear that I propose no public office in the Consulate, but simply that for the better maintenance of the line, the wire to the town office should run from the Consulate instead of direct from the cable-house; and also from a political point of view it would be infinitely more preferable to be able to send messages from the Consulate direct to British signallers at Henjam (where the erection of a Persian office seems problematical), than through the usual Persian Office in the town; for, I believe, cases have not infrequently occurred of Persian signallers divulging messages passing over their wires. 6. No special signaller would be necessary in the Consulate, at least at first, for the same system might obtain as at the British Residency (Sabza- had) in Bushire, where an ordinary office clerk receives a small extra allowance for telegraphy. 7 . I have been induced to bring up the point as during the past week I have frequently noticed disappointment expressed on its becoming known that the line was to be Persian; and in each case the reason given was that the line would be continually out of order. The scheme 1 have outlined above would obviate, to some extent at least, a considerable amount of such inutility. 8. If you consider it worth while ascertaining the views of the Telegraph Department upon the matter from a departmental bearing, I would beg that such reference be carried out expeditiously; for, once the line has been estab lished, local Persian suspicion of our aims would at once be aroused at any change subsequently suggested.
