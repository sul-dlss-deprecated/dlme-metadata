(E 6610/6221/65} My dear Clauson, i have been i . 1*7397/35 of 6th ilovember to Ward about gypsum concessions in the Persian Gulf, as ius interest for us is oiainly «persia a . Our views can, 1 think, be expressed in the four following propositions:~ (1/ There is no reason why any British firm which wishes to exploit gypsum deposits in Persia should not try to do so provided it abstains, both then and thereafter, from all similar activities in Arab POEEiGh OFFICE, S*,/.l 3rd December, 1935. territory, or at any rate in such parts of Arab territory as are claimed by Persiaj but that as the f i main object of Loch*© proposals is presumably to forestall the es .ablishment of American L;nd other foreign enterprises in Arab rather than in Persian I territory, fcliere would be no point in our suggesting to any British firm that it should interest itself in the Persian deposits* (2) There is in principle no reason why any British firm which is, and remains, free from commitments in Persia should not obtain and operate a gypsum concession on gbu Musa, in the same way that the Golden Valley Ochre company operates the red oxide concession on th t island; but looking at the matter irom our own point of view we should much prefer that no British firm should be asked to explore the possibility of doing so or given more than perfunctory encouragement if/ A, J. Claus on, Asqif it raises the question of its own accord* The result would only be another tiring and unprofitable wrangle with the Persian©, and the element ox unoertainty in the legal position of Taab and Abu Musa is just sufficient to male it undesirable to i revoke ouch wrangles gratuitously* naturally, if there were clear indications that a foreign company had its eye on Abu Muoa and we xelt that it would be unfair to forbid the sheikh to grant the concession without providing an alternative concessionaire, the position would have to be reconsidered. (1) There is no reason why any British firm which is and remains free from commitments in Persia should not bo urged to seek a concession to exploit the deposits in Bahrain, where our r oiicy is firmly to disregard the Persian claim* (4) There is no reason why any suitable British firm should not be urged to exploit the deposits in H&amp;lul island or in other Arab territory not claimed by Persia. .e agree that it would be worth while consulting the Department of Overseas Trade. Yours ever, (hi*, LAG! BAGOA-iLAY.Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. A copy lias been sent to L , by Mail. u6cl 3681Wz /V / f p. Z. 9115/35. IKDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 2nd January, 1936 » Will you please refer to Bushire Express Letter of 19th September, No. 728-S of 1935, in which Loch suggested that some British firm might obtain a concession for gypsum in the Persian Gulf, and to the further papers forwarded by air mail on the 13th December, No. P.Z.8708/35. The Department of Overseas Trade have now sent us additional information. Loch referred to the Golden Valley Company. The Department of Overseas Trade state, however, that the industrial importance of gypsum and red oxide is very different. Red oxide is an essential constituent of most lead paints and the finest variety of it exists only in the Persian Gulf. Gypsum, on the other hand, is available in large quantities in different parts of the world. It is in fact produced in the United Kingdom to a considerable extent and any supplementary imports are obtained from comparatively near countries such as France, Latvia and Lieut.Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., Consulate-General, Bushire. Italy./iVi ■ ^ 2 . Italy. The question whether an import from abroad would he a paying proposition probably depends upon the amount of freight, and it is therefore improbable that imports from the Persian G-ulf into the United Kingdom would pay. The only other large market within reach of the Gulf would probably be India, but India apparently also mines gypsum herself and therefore there is likely to be little demand in that country. It would accordingly seem inadvisable, if only on commercial grounds, to encourage a British firm to interest itself in gypsum concessions in the Gulf, strick and Company have not, as yet, approached the Department of Overseas Trade, and if they should do so the latter do not propose to give them any more than perfunctory encouragement. I am sending a copy of this letter to Acheson and t0 Loch - Yours sincerely.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000163_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/892</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000163</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/892</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File No. 40/1 ENQUIRIES BY STRICK &amp; CO.
