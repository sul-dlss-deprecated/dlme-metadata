Copy No. 1X2 [E 7158/239/34] Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—(Received November 16.) (No. 491. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, October 31, 1936. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed the counsellor of this Legation very confidentially yesterday that the Shah had designated him to replace M. Ala as Iranian Minister in London. M. Soheily went on to say that he was pleased and flattered by this, as the London Legation was the most important post in the Iranian Diplomatic Service, and the idea of London had always attracted him, but he also had considerable misgivings, as the Shah had made it clear that he expected a good deal from him in the new capacity. M. Soheily was evidently pleasurably excited by the prospect of London, but hardly less alarmed. Mr. Butler expressed the conviction that he would find a cordial welcome at the Foreign Office, for His Majesty’s late Minister had certainly reported the presence in M. Soheily of other qualities besides mere goodwill in the course of their co-operation last year. Mr. Butler then asked what sort of results M. Soheily thought the Shah had in mind, and M. Soheily referred to questions in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Butler said there had been one or 'two minor incidents in the Gulf, and wished Colonel Bayendor would use his influence to bring home to his countrymen there the British conception of the position and authority of a captain of a vessel, but it was presumably not incidents of this kind that the Shah had in mind; and M. Kazemi had given His Majesty’s late Minister to understand that the Bahrein question was virtually dead. M. Soheily did not dissent from this; what he said was a little difficult to understand (the conversation took place at a Turkish reception), but he spoke of small islands in the Gulf, and specifically mentioned Tamb. The drift of his remarks seemed to be that Persia to-day was impatient- perhaps “ insistent ” in the sense used recently in connexion with India better expresses what he meant to convey—and that Great Britain was rather slow. Mr. Butler referred to the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu. M. Soheily knew that, as regards other islands in the Gulf, we were not free agents but trustees for the Arab sheikhs, and our interest in the Arab coast was not diminishing. The conversation turned to the Shatt-el-Arab. M. Soheily said that he was not impressed by M. Alas recent letter to you, bir. but your reply to him M. Soheily made a gesture which seemed to suggest that an impasse had been reached. Mr. Butler said that M. Ala’s letter had seemed to him to have contained two or three provocative passages, and that your reply set out very clearly the views of His Majesty’s Government. Referring to the Shatt-el-Arab, M. Soheily said that he still did not know what the attitude of the Iraqis really was. Mr. Butler suggested that he should have a full discussion of these questions with myself; and confined himself to emphasising how unfavourably the Persian position as regards arbitration contrasted with that of Iraq. 2. Mr. Butler enquired whether M. Ala was to succeed to M. Soheily here, but M. Soheily was non-committal. 3. Lest' the preceding paragraphs should give rise to an unjustified deduction, I would add that M. Ala’s move from London has long been fore shadowed by those in Ministry for Foreign Affairs circles. It is the practice for a new Minister for Foreign Affairs to change the incumbents of the principal Embassies, and M. Ala is practically the only one not yet moved by M. Samiy. 4 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No. 237, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, N0 - 89 ' I have, &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR.

It is possible, if a story in circulation is for once true, that Ansari's recall is the result of his having oriticized the handling of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company business in a personal telegram to the Shah.

The telegraphic correspondence below speaks for itself. The resigning Minister, Hovannes Khan, has represented Persia at the Court of St. James' since August 1927. He has never been a real force, either here or in Persia. An extract dated 1926 from the Persian 'ho's ' r lio, describing the career of the new inister, is attached. It will be noted that he was responsible for the negotiation in 1921 of t.xe T ^erso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Moscow. Previous Papers :—26 / xtract from Persian ,, .'ho , s \7ho. 25. Seyid Hassan Tagizadeh . 1926. Bom in Tabriz about 186' , the son of a siaall preacher in the mosque, hducated in Tabriz, he used to haunt the booksellers’ shops in that town, where he showed great eagerness to obtain knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent rationalist and was connected rich the Nationalist movement in Persia from its inception. He founded the Izerbaijan hub in Tehran and was one of tne most prominent members of tne first Majlis. liohammad hi Shah hated and feared him particularly, and when tne Shah made his coup c * hat in June 1908 against the hajlis, Taqizadeh took refuse in His ajesty's Legation. he Shah demanded that he should be given up, but the demand'was refused and Taqizadeh finally received an a nesty on condition that he left ersia for a time. He went to London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1906. He was elected a member of the second Hajlis in 1909. He was a member of the Nationalist bmmittee formed after tne taking o- Tehran in July 19 r 9 by the Nationalist force and tne abdication of ohammad All Shah, to arrange the government of the country. He left Tehran for Turope in July 191C. He was elected to tne third and fourth hajlisses, but cia not take his seat. He travelled in Hurope an America between 1914 and 1923, ctaying for years in Berlin, where he edited a newspaper called 'Kaveh '. Durin 0 this time the mujtehids excommunicated him for having printed certain articles which they alleged were in contravention of ^sl^m. He negotiated tne Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in 'oscow in February 1921, and returned finally to Persia in 1924. He was elected to the fifth tem of the Hajlis, 192.--A 0 26, and to the sixth teru in 1926. He went to America in 1926 as Persian representative at the Philadelphia Exhibition. Taqizadeh is a well-read nan aid widely travelled, but no longer enjoys the popularity v hich he once dia in the early days of the Constitution. He no longer shows the zeal and energy which formerly gained him many adherents, and althouji at times his speeches in the .ajlis ..iark him as a man of common sense an moderation, he seems unv;illin_ to 1 ish to play a role in the politics of the country. This desire to taxe a back seat is in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm and zeal of the fiery youn 0 orator of the first days of one onstitution and gives his countrymen the impression that he is played out. !
