            Kishme [Qeshm] on his way back to Bushire, as per the instructions of the Bombay
            Government. It notes that the British force had moved to Sallack, which is where the
            Resident rendezvoused with the force. It is concluded that both the Resident and
            Lieutenant-Colonel Rennett, Acting Political Agent, agree that Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū] is a
            much more suitable location to base a permanent force than Sallack. The letter outlines
            the process the pair went through in order to reach this conclusion.Enclosed with the letter is Lieutenant-Colonel
            Rennett's report (dated 5 March 1822) on the suitability of Bassidore as a
            permanent base for the British force in the lower Gulf. It also explains that the move
            will not require much additional expense. The enclosure further includes a letter from
            Assistant Surgeon Fallon of the
                           Aurora, which states that it is his opinion that a more suitable location
            could not be found on the island of Kishme.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000012#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
