Writing in the early 13th century, he is said to have been one of the last poets before modern times to have composed in the classical style. His Diwan (Poetry collection) is lauded for its historical as well as literary qualities. It is considered a primary source for geography and history as well as genealogy and information about the social and cultural conditions of his region. Al-Muqarrab’s tribe, the al-‘Uyuni, ruled portions of the coast of the Arabian Peninsula for more than 150 years, from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Failed political ambitions caused al-Muqarrab to flee to Baghdad and Mosul (present-day Iraq). Historian ‘Abd al-Khalaq al-Janbi discusses many of the strengths and weaknesses of al-Muqarrab as a historian, and notes the confusion in reference works over his name and the authorship of works attributed to him. Manuscripts of the Diwan are found in many Western and Middle Eastern libraries. The edition presented here was printed in Mecca in 1889 and reprinted in Bombay in 1892.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Islamic Empire</topic></subject><subject><topic>Poetry</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Mecca</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabic poetry</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabian Peninsula--Social life and custom</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/12921#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
