Only a few weeks ago Bahrain was honoured by a visit from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Saud whom most people recognise as the greatest man in the Arab world to-day, and I am sure that it will be a matter of as much satis faction and pleasure to all residents in Bahrain as it was to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad himself that the King should have expressed so much admiration of the work of administration of this country. Certainly the King’s praise of Bahrain was a source of very great pleasure to me, who, as the representative of the British Government, have every reason for knowing that the ties of friendship between the British Government and His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa are firm and constant, and ever-increasing in strength. 3. To-day I wish to speak to you chiefly about two matters, Education and Malaria. In regard to Education it is expected that an expert will arrive in Bahrain in two or three days’ time in order to e xamine the system of education existing here and to advise, with due regard to the needs of Bahrain, how it may best be expanded and improved. I should like to repeat here what I produce great numbers of graduates for whom no employment can be found, but to prepare children to become useful and decent citizens, earning an honest livelihood according to their capacity and contributing towards the prosperity and contentment said to you before, that the object of education is not to of /- /■ n ( 2 ) of the country. It may be that the expert will invite the views of some of you on the problem of education, and possibly also an advisory committee may be formed in due course to help in education matters. If this is so I trust that you will bear my words in mind and will remember that the system of education, if it is to be of real benefit, must be framed to meet the needs of the country as they exist. Above all things the system must be simple and business-like^and technical education must play a prominent part. To my mind, one of the most satisfactory features in Bahrain to-day is the training given in the Girls* Schools. The; are taught useful accomplishments, such as sewing and cookery, cleanliness and household management, and I do not doubt that they will be very valuable citizens of the future Do you not agree with me that this is 'technical education' the best type ? 4. The question of malaria is one about which I feel very strongly. I have seen in other countries the ravages that malaria can make in the population and I see here in Bahrain how it affects the physique and capacity of the people for work. As you know an expert came here last year from India and he has prepared plans on the basis of which it should oe possible ultimately to eradicate malaria entirely from Bahrain. But if this is to be done the people of the towns and the villages must co-operate, and they must be prepared to undergo some slight inconveniences at times, ^or instance in the towns almost every house and almost every barasti has a shallow well from which water is taken for washing purposes. All these wells are full of the larvae of mosquitoes and so long as they exist malaria will continue in Bahrain. Admittedly people must have water for washing and the possibility of providing an alternative supply will be considered. Then that alternative supply is assured then those shallow wells in the towns must be filled /-filled in; and I should consider any person who obstructed this work as an enemy of the people, and I hope he would be dealt with accordingly. Such a project must take time of course, but meanwhile much can be done by keeping such wells clean, and by putting into them small fish which eat the lar^vae of the mosquitoes. Obviously it will be essential for the officers of the medical department occasionally to enter private houses to inspect the wells, to introduce fish and to see that the fish remain alive and so on. 3uch visits need only be made two or three times a year, and I trust that all of you here to-day will do everything you can /to make the people understand that such visits are made for their own benefit and for the benefit of their neighbours, and that there should be no obstruction. Similarly those persons who own gardens must keep the water channels and aitcnes in oheir gardens clean, and if they do not do so they must be prepared for Government officers to go and do it for them, in which case of course they will have to pay the cost. I fully admit that a little inconvenience may be caused occasionally, but what is that compared with the unhappiness which must result sc long as malaria continues in Bahrain ? I would like also to mention here the arrival in Bahrain of the new Lady Doctor. She has a tremendous task before her, and many be a success. But the health of the next generation depends 1 on the well-being of the women of to-day and I rely therefore in your power. 5. You will remember that in my last speech I told you that His Highness the Shaikh was trying to introduce improve ment in the Bahrain Court, and some of you may think that nothing much has been done. I should like to assure you that efforts are being made to find experts to come here and advise in regard to judicial matters, and that the delay is due only to the difficulty of finding men with ripe experience!! old-fashioned prejudices must be abandoned if her work is to on all of you to give the Lady Doctor all the aid and support-4- and knowledge v^ho c an advise in a manner suitable for an Arab country, 6. I spoke also to you in January about thejefforts made by agitators to cause misunderstandings between the Oil Company and its Bahraini employees. Most of you here must know about the appointment of Shaikh Ali bin Ahmad al Khalifah as the Bahrain Government’s representative with the Oil Company, whose business it is to explain to the Company any difficulties which the workmen may experience, and also to explain on behalf of the Company to the workmen the efforts which are being made to remove any reasonable grievances they may have and to improve their conditions. Thus there is now no reason why there should be any misunderstandings, and I sincerely hope that the appoint ment of Shaikh Ali bin Ahmad will be of much benefit both to the Company and to its Bahraini employees. fit gives me pleasure to be able to tell you to-day that the Company has decided to introduce a plan by which employees who have completed 12 months’ continuous service and have not been absent without proper reason from work for more than 5 days will be given 10 days’ leave on full pay. The full details of this plan will be made known to employees at once. I understand that the Company have under consideration the grant of further con cessions for their employees in due course, but it must natural ly be recognised that all such concessions must be dependent on regular attendance and steady work by employees. 1 7. I have told you a good deal to-day over which I hope you will ponder carefully. Let all of us remember that our duty is to try to work together for the common good of the whole popula tion of Bahrain; and let us remember too that good-will and co-operation can remove obstacles to progress which at first sight seem almost insuperable.\ 1 'sS .{ ^iliac*.. ^k' W *** ' • l\ c, iUksg *1^ wi i* ^ ^ ♦* ‘VS, .^“ :x {LUj - « +ipjgZ* lULi «| *1^ -* *1 jj^ ,i^V L ^ i t-j yZs+ij* * {JU^i a^v iiA^ $ &gt;&lt;► ! 1*~J '.., «i V- -* ‘ ,/ ''v. ^ Sj f -' •'f‘ i * \ k v* '*’ ' k V^ ,- hr y ^ L^. ^ (jwiAiik myH'j j-'^&lt; * &gt;* ‘ ^ H~iL' ■-* i &lt;J.

How different this war is from what we all expected. For years the Germar propagandists have been trying to impress us with stories of overwheim- L ing strength on land and in the air. ; ue were told to expect to see the great cities of England jasate waste s. 5. MOIPC—SB— \ nSS'SiVFlMFF—fM-0I4) —^-3-30 -60,000 Pads and her Navy destroyed, while the German Army overran Europe. And h u what has happened ? Two bombs have *Hitler /- dropped on British soil one of which did no damage while the other killed a rabbit^. The British Air Force is already more than a match for the Germans and thanks to the Empire Air Training Scheme it is gaining in strength at a rate with which Germany cannot possibly compete. German ships have been swept from the sea and her much-vaunted submarines are being destroyed at a great pace. On land the huge army of which she was so proud is afraid to attack the French and British lines. Meanwhile Britain and France have tightened the blockade on Germany and by their methods of economic warfare are slowly destroying the German bully. ; It may not be a spectacular form of war fare; but its results are certain and inevitable. Already discontent is grow ing in enemy territory and in Vienna for instance sarcastic notices have been v—\ O exhibited such as this:- 'Live without food; wash without soap, dress without clothes.' 2.&amp;*&gt;'iVie war is far from finished yet. The German people are fed w their Nazi leaders^/ lies / about successes and false rumours about the alleged weakness of the Allies. The rest of the world can appreciate the German propaganda at its true value, but in Germany itself the people are cut off from all outside sources of information and are subjected to the treatment which-3- (4-T Hitler recommended years ago in his book 'Mein Kampf'• There he wrote: 'If you tell the beginning a lie and repeat it frequently enough you can fefc* make/people believe it.' This kind of treatment can of course only succeed with foolish people for a compa ratively short time and in the end the Germans will realise how Hitler and his Nazis have »£pq3ed and misled them. And that will be the end of Hitler and the / end of the war. 3. Meanwhile the unity of interests which exists between the Allies and the Arab countries becomes daily more apparent^ and it is a source of great pride to all of us here that His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad should have given a lead by his magnificent gift of £ 30,000 to Great j Britain towards the cost of the prosecu tion of the war. A* 'Ca~ACT Ci. 4. It is a ffourrap-- rtf &lt; i n mm satis-, faction that Bahrain has been affected so little by this war. We all know of cours^, that there has been a rise in the cost of living for most people; for Bahrain unfortunately has to import practically all its requirements and since prices ha ; e risen over almost the whole world it is inevitable that there should be a rise here too. But you are aware of the I steps that havqbeen taken to prevent profiteering far as we can and to 1 ' r ensure the contimued supply of necessary commodities. In this connection I should like /--4- like to say that I shall always be most willing to consider any suggestions on this particular subject that any member of the public may care to make. =*j'**\Let us now turn to consider for a moment the progress that has been made in Social Services in Bahrain in the past six months. I feel sure that you will agree with me that the most pleasing achievement has been the improved control of malaria. A great deal of hard work has been done by the Malaria Committee and its executive officers and the result has been that we have had fev/er mosquitoes and less malaria during the past Autumn than Bahrain has known for many years. An excellent beginning has been made in up artesian wells in order to pro vide a pipeiwater supply in all parts of Manama town^and the Baladiyah is providing j considerable sums of money for filling in stagnant swamps. Of course you will realise that we are still only at the beginning of our attack on the malaria problem and that we have many difficulties $ to overcome and probably several reverses to suffer before we can claim complete success. Nevertheless the beginning has been most heartening and I think that the members of the Malaria Committee deserve suecial praise from their fellow-citizens for the work that they have done. In the field of education too there is much cause for satisfaction. Mr. Valiance^who came to Bahrain in the summer to examine local education pro blems^ has now returned as permanent Director of Education. As most of you know he has had considerable experience(PJ A -2” - P / ( in Iraq already and that experience has not only taught him sympathy with Arab ideals but has also shown him the pitfalls which have to be avoided in marking out the path towards the ideal of useful education. His task will be long and none too easy and I hope that all of you here today will give him your whole hearted support, remembering that in edu cation we cannot expect to see results in a few weeks but w ; e have to plan for the future and be prepared to wait for re sults to 3lOW. \ Another development which will be particularly pleasing to residents of Muharraq is the progress being made to wards the completion of the bridge. I had myself feared that the war would put a total st&amp;p to this work, and the arrival,' of two engineers in Bahrain to carry on this pro.iect was as surprising to me as it was satisfactory.. Unless war require ments now interfere with the supply of steel-work the coming year should see the two islands finally linked^PIn only one respect I am unable to report any pro- gress and that is His Highness f plans l* for the improvement of the judicial system of Bahrain. Believe me it is not for want of effort.but purely owing to the dislocation in all countries which has resulted from the outbreak of war. I can however assure you that the matter has not been lost sight of and, war or no war, I hope that before long you will&gt; * ■■ s?'j C - 3 - r see result l a# the efforts being made to put His Highness 1 wishes into practice Finally it is satisfactory to be able to tell, you that the leave plan which, as I informed you last June, the Oil Company were then about to put into practice has actually come into effect. Most of the Company* s employees are, I think, genuinel: pleased ,though curiously enough some of the men say that they would much rather &amp;o on working without leave/ At the same time the Company are going ahead with their plans for improving housing condi tions. Many of you will have seen the first of the new masonry blocks which has been put up and I hope that you will agree with me that it looks extremely satisfac tory. I am afraid this speech is becoming very long and though there are many matters on which I should like to speak to you ztrt&amp;i I think the time has come to bring it to an end. A wish you all the best of fortune during the coming year and I know that all of you will join me in hoping that we shall xkb during the year see the war brought to a satisfac- tory end, peace and justice and interna tional good faith restored throughout the world •/(sy No V!

I should be glad if the usual Guard of Honour could be detailed to wait upon His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ^sa al-Khalifah, K*C*I*E*, C.S.I. on the occasion of his visit to me on the 1st January,194&lt;L, at 9-30 A.M., the New Year’s Day. I /H for Political Agent, Bahrain. ij/ L JmamNew Year Day Speech - 1942 A full year has now oassed since our last meeting in this room and it gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the Agency once more. It is with great sorrow that we miss the nresence of Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman 7,ayani^ one of our oldest and most respected friends. T 7e all hope however that his good name may be kept up by his son. Last year X mentioned how glad we were to note the improvement in the health of His Highness Shaikh Hamad and we all sincerely hoped that the improvement would continue in the future. It gives me great pleasure to s ay that our hopes have been fulfilled. His Bighness* health is, by the grace of ^od, better than ever and may it so continue. The important event of the year has been the expedition of ^is highness together , vV £i th br °thers Sh.Mohammad and Sh. Abduf la hand his sons and others on a hunting trip to Saudi Arabia. Here in Bahrain we were highly j gratified and delighted when we heard /( the news of the unexpected and greatly welcome visit of His Majesty King Ibn 3aud to His Highness' camp and we were the more pleased at his being able to prolong his stay and that the hunting was sc successful and the weather so favourable. It gave us all much plea sure also to learn of the visit of His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabr As Subah of Kuwait.2 - As regards the war, we have again seen vast and surprising develop ments during the last year...the attack by the Germans on Russia and the sudden, and treacherous attack by the Japanese on the United States of America and Great Britain and the entry of America ' into the war on the side of Great Britain and Russia. The position now, at the beginning of the new Christian year shows a great improvement. The Italians have been finally driven out of Abyssinia. In Libya^the Imperial forces have hurled back the Germans and Italians and it appears likely that the enemy forces will be annihilated and the whole of Italian North Africa be captured by us. In Russia the victorious Russian armies are advancing along the whole 1500-mlle front driv ing the Germans before them. Vast quantities of military equipment, gun$ tanks etc., as well as huge numbers of prisoners are f ailing into the hands of the Russians. In the Bar East the Japanese have made a rash and treacherous move against America and Great Britain but, as President Roose velt has just said in his latest speech, it is not who fires the first shot that matters, but who fires the last shot. * It should not be forgotten that Great Britain, after the fall- 3 - [S') i v? * of France, stood alone In the world and faced the whole weight of the German armies. In spite of this how ever she has succeeded in bringing about a serious weakening of the German military, economic and moral strength through constant and relentless air bombardments over Germany and the occupied countries. These attacks have been going on day and night with- ouu rest or respite since the very beginning; each month they increase and the destruction which has been wrought in the German war industries is incalculable. It is no doubt lap^e- ~y hue to this that the 'Russians have so soon been able to take the offen sive and the Imperial forces in Libya have been able to rout the Germans and Italian forces there. Now, at the beginning of the new Christian .. year instead oi standing alone as we die las ^ year Great Britain is carrying on whe war in alliance with Russia and America, the most powerful nations of the world. In the Near East and Persian Gulf also we have seen notable events, 1 the overthrow' of a dangerous plot by the Axis Powers to seize control of Iraq, the rescue of Syria by Imperial forces from Vichy and Axis domination, and the bestowal by us upon the Syrians 01 their longed for independence are y ■ L * matters of great pleasure to us all.' (ito) \ ^ ^ - 4 - In Iran^seizure of the c ountry by German so-called ?t tourists ,r was only just prevented by the Allied forces and the country is now enjoying a greater measure of prosperity than before. As regards local affairs, the good news of the appointment of Colonel Prior, our Political Resident and very good friend, to the Middle Rast War Council has given great pleasure to all and we have, at the same time, had the good fortune to welcome our new friend Colonel Kay, who has taken over as Political Resident in the Persian Criilf. The opening by His highness of the new Manama-Muharraq bridge, which we all witnessed the other day, h^s been a notable event in the history of Bahrain and will have great influence L on the future development of the towns of Manama and Muharraq. As noted last year, the oublic health of the Islands shows continued improvement and this is due to the labours of Dr. Snow and the officers of the State Medical Department. Mala ria although greatly lessened is still much too prevalent and its eradication from the Islands calls for still further co-operation. Waste water and swamps have to be drained and we are s till awaiting the installa tion of a proper water supply and drainage scheme which will howeverhave to await the end of the war* Last year at this time the houses of the poor classes were still standing deep in the floods caused by the heavy rains. This year, if rain does fall, we have new drainage canals to carry away the water and it is hoped that the poor will not again have to endure the trials of last year. V/e have to welcome the new Director of Education, Mr. Wakelin who has come to us from Cairo and w e confidently look forward to great ad vances in the Educational Department during the coming year. The Manama College has suc cessfully completed its first year and now enters on its second with an increased strength of over 60 students. The course lasts three years and it is hoped that the first graduates will acquit themselves well when they go out into the world at the end of this time. The buildings of the Technical School are now complete and the School is beginning zo go ahead. Mr. Hut chings, its first Principal, has arrived and we are glad to note that he is a man of wide experience, who has served in the Hear East. T Ve all look forward to seeing excellent results from the School. As a result of your generous contributions to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund a war plane was6 - f42) (XO purchased and named the r, Al 'Rahrain' 1 .

Due to the War, the arrangements for the King’s Birthday celebrations at the Agency were cancelled between the years 1940 and 1944, and invitations were only sent to the Shaikh of Bahrain and his family. For the King’s Birthday, a notice was sent regularly by the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf announcing which day in June the birthday would occur that year. For Christmas, a memorandum was sent by the Political Agent in Bahrain with a sum of money to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. The memorandum instructed the Adviser to distribute sweets among the prisoners on Christmas Day. The following arrangements were made for each ceremony when it took place:refreshments including biscuits (Nice), coffee, sherbet, crystallised cherries, Mackintosh toffees and tin biscuits (unsweetened) were ordered mainly from Jashanmal &amp; Son;European and American community members as well as Bahrain Petroleum Company’s staff were invited;personal invitations were sent to Shaikh Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa respectively;a guard was appointed to receive the Shaikhs and their family members at the Agency;the speech of the appointed Political Agent was read on the occasion, focusing mainly on malaria and education in Bahrain as well as affairs concerning the Second World War (1939-45).Lists of invitees from among Manamah and Muharraq notables, and Indian invitees, and records of absentees were drawn up. After each ceremony a report was written summarising the event. The correspondence is mainly between Political Agents Hugh Weightman, Major Reginald George Evelyn William Alban and Tom Hickinbotham, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, and Shaikh Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Ḥamad bin 'Īsá Āl Khalīfah, Hakim of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Bahrain Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Birthdays</topic></subject><subject><topic>Christmas</topic></subject><subject><topic>Monarchs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00018f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
