As the other Prefaces were fil led with Inftru&amp;ions and Do cuments of pure Zeal; Co (hall this with the delightful Enter tainment of a curious Refle xion. For when Fortune makes ^ it her Sport to heap Burdens of Care, there is none fo refolved or unmoved but requires Di- verfion and Eafe.

The chief Suftenance of that Ga. rifon for fome days was a fmall Fruit, fo harlli they could not fwallow it, unlefs rowled in Afhes. 9. The Supplies were fent by the Viceroy to Mofamhique, but never reached Chimt, which thereupon was abandoned. The ha tred the Lawyer Franc'n de Fonfeca Pinfa to whom the Viceroy had given the whole Charge of the Affair,bore to James Simoew, was the caufe he was not Relieved, and that important Place loft. 10. This is that Francu de Fonfecs Pinh who ( as was laid beforej took ihe Com- mand of Mozambique from Kuy de Melotr Sampajo, and had all Neceflaries for Chun- va, as well of Provifions as Tools to work in the Mines. But his hatred toSimoens diver ted him from fending thofe Succors ^ befidff, he Ibid all that was to relieve that Place, and converted it to his own ufe, and leized upon Kuy de Melons Effeds.

Simoens under- ftandingic withdrew thence, and P/w/o hear ing of it, though lb near, would not relieve the Fort, nor examine the Mines as he had in Orders.but returned haftily to 7&lt;?/(?,fearing J.imes Simoens (hould meet him. But going back to the Fort, cauftd the Notary to draw an Inftrument, containing the Caufes why that Fort was abandoned, to which they all (igned. This done, they marched with their Women and Children towards lete. 11. Weakneis caufed them to march very flow, and two Soldiers fell dead tor want.g At Marevga, Simoens received a Summons from Vinto, to appear before him at lete in 9 Days to anfwer for himfelf. But knowing now he had quitted the Fort, fent 2000 Ca- frcs commanded by a Portugues to murder him ; they, tho 1 the opportunity was ore- fented, would not do it. Simoens fta^ed in the Country of Inambsn^o which was his Own, and all the Company went to Tete. There Pmto inquired of them, whether there were any Mines at Chicova, they all nnani- toouffy anfwered there were. But he in hatred Sityoens defiring ro conceal them, with E 4 Ttircats■ the Fort ague s Afia. ' Part III, Threats and Rewards prevailed with each of them llngle to fwear there were none, Then he gave Sentence againft Simoens for abandoning the Fort , not confidering if there were no Mines there (as he endeavour' ed to made out) it was no Crime, and that if any fault were it was his own, fince the other held it longer than could be required. 15. This done Vinto Promifes the Em peror a confiderable Prefent, if he would fail upon Simoens at Jnambanzo. The Ed peror not only expelled Simoens thofe Lands, but fo diftrefled Tete, that they were forced to make up the Prefent promifed by Finto, to buy his ablence, the Emperor pofitively re quiring it at their hands. James Simoens after, wards returned to lete, being utterly ruined by his good Service, and Pinto who had ruined all was enriched by his Villanies and Rapine, This is what happened about the Mines of Mono mot apa. 1 will only add that the firft Com mander there, Francis Barreto, was undone by a Divine, and now James Simoens the !aft by a Lawyer • and the King, by employing fuch Gownmen in things they underftand not, loft the great Advantages might be expend from thofe Mines.

Hiercme Oforio, wrote the Hiftory of India in Latin, which beyond dilpute is the beft Work of that Nature; next to Tiim Livm. As to his Latin, all Men grant him to be the beft Ciceronian. His me thod is fingular, his Judgment piercing, his Refledions lharp, his Ornament majeftick. In fine, be is accomplifhed in all Points. 8. Haftvs is well known and very plea- fant; he did little but Epitomizing the De cades of John de Barros, as to the Subftancc ot the Hiltory. 9. F. Antony de S.
