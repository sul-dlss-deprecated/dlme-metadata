Political Agency, Kuv/ai t. January 13 th,19 ^0. Your V° No.?°05 dated 30th December 1919. I enclose a statement ^ivin^ full details of the weights and measures used in and near Kuwait. Your letter only reached me on the 7th Inst. This will explain the apparent delay in replying. The fault is not mine as you see but the wretched postal ser vice between Basrah and here. Yours sincerely, C.R.Catkins,Esqre. ,0.1.E., Chief Collector of Customs, BASRAH.sO ^ The unit of weight in Kuwait is the ”Waqiyah M which is equal to 4 lbs. 1C. ozb. avoirdupois - the weight of 75 Maria Theresa dollars on which the waqi/ah is based. There are five distinct maunds or 'muns M in use. These are as follows I. II. Maund of 11 waqiyahs = 55 lbs. 10.64 ozs. This is used for sail-cloth only. Maund of .14 waqiyahs — 111 lbs. 5.13 ozs. * used for ’’^hi” (clarified butter),fat and Juss yyypsuraj. III. Maund of 17 waqiyahs - 115 lbs. 3.94 ozs. Uiie local government' s measure for weiyhiny O oods -'or assess ment of duty. It is also used in the bazaar for wel^h- ln^ all commodities for which there is not a special measure. IV. Maund of 30 waqiyahs = 139 lbs. 1.6 ozs. This is used for wheat,barley and ’Iraq rice. V. Maund of 43 waqiyahs = 111 lbs. 1C.56 ozs. Tnis is used for su^yar only. Twenty maunds of 30 waqiyahs — 1 ta^ar — 1733 lbs. 4 ozs. For tea in small quantities,the ”ratl” is used. The rati which is supposed to represent an English lb.avoirdupois, is actually 14.344 ozs or the fifth part of a waqiyah. For yold, silver,jold thread and perfumeries in small quantities, the'mltqal' an! 'tolah' are used. One Indian tolah ~ H mitqals. For pearls,the unit of weight Is base l on the milan measure died ''ehao',but 1 Kuwait chao = 4 Indian or 5 Poona chaos. ICO dukra ~ 1 chao 330 chaos - 1 mitqal or 149 yrains (Troy) 66 habbe “ l mitqal. o The Linear unit of measure is the dhira (cubit) and equals 19^ inches. 3 The 4-^allon kerosine oil tin is used as a measure of capacity. It is principally used In the sale of water but -hi, fat,and 'dibis' (date-honey) are sometimes sold by the tin. Perfumeries in lar^e quantities are measured by the 'qarablyih' - a particular make and size of bottle\A KS No. c/23 of 1920. British Roaidsncy 1c Osneulats-Ganeral, Bushins, 28th January, 1920.
