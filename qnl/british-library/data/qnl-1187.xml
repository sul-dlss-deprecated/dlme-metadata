Dharwar Cotion Gin Factory, 11M February 1859. To T. OGILVY, Esq., Collector of Dharwar. Sin, 1 have the honour to forward the usual Half-yearly Statement of the Operations of the Dharwar Cotton Gin Factory for the period ending 30th November 1858. 2. The amount of work performed during the above term, as shown by the accompanying Returns, and the value of the same, have been as follows:— Value of work done upon 27 gins of 18 saws each,, complete Ditto ditto 28 ditto 10 ditto, ditto Ditto ditto 2 ditto 18 ditto, and 2 of 10 saws each which were not completed Value of work done in altering 23 gins of 8 saws each to the present model Value of Tools and Implements made for the use of the Factory Cost of constructing a new Pile Engine for the Public Works Department. Cost of altering one old Pile Engine for the Public Works Department .. The value of Materials consumed amounts to Rs. 3,144 0 0 And cost of Wa^es to Artizans and Workmen „ 4,418 2 4 Deducted from the above sum leaves a balance to the Cre- Rs. a. P- 4,539 0 0 3,079 0 0 6 0 0 714 0 0 6 0 0 1,058 4 5 259 5 10 74 11 0 9,736 5 3 7,562 2 4 2,174 2 11 This latter item is the return from 25 per cent., added to the selling price of gins over the cost of their construction, and also of repairs and other work done with the view of covering the outlay in Buildings, wear and tear of Machinery and Tools, &amp;c.; and, on the present occasion, as has been the case for some time back, it is also sufficient to meet the expense of European superintendence, so that the Establishment is conducted at no loss to Government. 3. The 23 gins of 8 saws each abovementioned, as having been altered, are the remainder of the stock on hand of the old construction. They will now sell at Rs. 100 a piece. 4. A Pile Driving Machine was urgently wanted for the construction of Bridges on the Military roads now being made in the Belgaum Collectorate; and, at the request of the Executive Engineer, I constructed one from a model which I had designed. It has been found to answer the purpose so well that, if permitted to do so, I shall be happy to submit a working model for the inspection of Government, as 1 believe that, if generally known, it will be extensively used for the construction of Pile Bridges, espe cially in black soil countries, where it is often difficult to obtain a good foundation for masonry, and where building materials are also frequently not easily procurable. 5. The advantages it offers are economy in labour and great celerity in the perform ance of the work. One carpenter and eight coolies are all the hands required in using2 it, and with these it is capable of driving three rows of piles per day, which will cover from thirty to forty feet according to the size and strength of the timber available for the upper structure. 6. The Agents of the Railway Contractors have already appeared in this neigh bourhood, and, owing to the high rates of wages offered, they succeed in removing arti- zans at a rate that must ere long render the scarcity of workmen a source of great in convenience. For this reason I think it would be desirable to increase the number of apprentice boys now employed in the Factory. Thirteen have already been indentured for a term of three years. They have been carefully selected, and promise soon to become expert hands. 7. The Mechanical Superintendent, Mr. Charles Courpalais, is still engaged in the Factory; not having succeeded in procuring the employment he anticipated, he begged to be permitted to withdraw his application to resign, and that he might be allowed to continue in his present situation until an opening should occur for him elsewhere. 8. As the Cotton-cleaning season is now approaching, I have been desirous of ascertaining the condition of the gins throughout the districts, and workmen have, accord ingly, been sent to inspect them. I am glad to state that they are generally represented as in good order, though many of them have now been two seasons in work, and this has also been the case with the gins supplied to Messrs. A. C. Brice &amp; Co., who, I regret to say, have recently retired from the Cotton trade of these districts. Previously to doing so, however, I received a communication from them expressive of the satisfaction the gins had afforded, and stating that, though they had now been two years in work with out repair, they were still in such good condition that they were enabled to dispose of them at a very trifling discount on their original cost. 9. Having very recently paid a visit of inspection to that part of the Canara Forest from which timber has hitherto been procured for the Factory, I think it necessary to bring to notice, that the supply has become all but exhausted, and that, with exception of a small quantity which has just been cut, very little more need be expected from that quarter, nor is there any other source that I am aware of, with exception of imported wood, which, owing to the distance from the coast, would prove much too expensive. 10. Under these circumstances it is evident that very soon this part of the country must trust for a supply of machinery to the plan recently entertained of procuring Cast- iron gins from home. A model for this purpose was forwarded to the Manchester Associa tion in March last, and it is becoming very desirable that the movement should be expedited, more especially as the recent introduction of New Orleans Cotton into the Ceded Districts must very soon add considerably to the large demand already existing for saw gins. A supply of these articles has just been forwarded to the Commissioner, Mr. Taylor, at Lingasoogoor, who writes to say that he very shortly expects from his districts ' to have large orders for more,' and hopes that this Factory will be able to meet the demand. 11. A quantity consisting of six hundredweight of fresh American Cotton Seed was received here from the Chamber of Commerce on the 18th of October last. It was feared that the season had passed, but fortunately some rain fell afterwards. I imme diately had it sown, and, considering the disadvantage of the lateness of the period, it has thriven very well, promising a fair crop. As it will be very desirable to secure the seed from any admixture for next season's sowing (an object which will receive no attention from the Ryots in possession of it), I purpose sending a trustworthy person from the Factory with the means of cleaning the Cuppas, and preserving the seed. I hope my doing so will meet with the approval of Government. 12. This affords such a favourable opportunity of ascertaining what the value of pure Indian grown American Cotton would be in the home market, as compared with the adulterated mixture which is at present supplied, that I have thought it advisable to bring the circumstance to the notice of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, trusting that they would see the advantage of purchasing the produce of this seed with a view to its being sent home; and I am glad to say that, by to-day's post, I have received a reply fromthe Chairman intimating the Chamber's intention of buying the Cotton. This measure will not only 'decide the merits of the abovementioned question, but it will also test the aptitude of the Dharwar gins for cleaning this description of produce, and it will be seen whether the complaints against it arise from the adulteration alluded to, or from injury inflicted by the saws. The subject is one to which I have devoted much attention, and, as far as the means at my disposal have enabled me to form an opinion, I am satisfied that New Orleans Cotton suffers no more damage from the saw here than it does in America: with the same material to operate upon, there should be no reason for the gin not per forming its duty as well in one country as the other; and from having in my possession both Seed and Cotton cleaned in America, I have been in a position to compare the results. At the same time, however, I am much pleased with a prospect which will afford to the most competent judges an opportunity of deciding for themselves ; but to show that I am not singular in the conclusion which I have come to, I shall take the liberty of quoting a passage in the letter which I have received to-day from the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. He states—' I have long had the conviction that the difficulty of preserving the identity of Cotton grown from New Orleans seed is the real cause of the objections to saw ginning, for the machine that will turn out the long staple without the least injury, will break and utterly destroy the staple of indigenous Cotton.' 13. The application of the present gin to the cleaning of indigenous Cotton is an entirely different affair. There can be no doubt of its being unsuited to the purpose, and that the staple is accordingly so seriously damaged, that a continuance of its use is an error calculated only to bring gins into discredit. 14. As far back as 1855* I brought this subject to notice, and since that time no Native Cotton has been cleaned by the saw in these districts. I September 1855 ^' 0t 2 ' th believe a gin may be made which would answer the purpose, but it must differ in many material points from the article which is now in general use throughout this Presidency, more especially as regards the description of saw applied. 15. This report would be unduly lengthened if I were to endeavour to explain the theory of the mode in which the saw gin operates in separating the Cotton fibre from its seed. If properly applied, the saw is eminently suited to the purpose, and such an application of it was the invention of an ingenious mind, but, on the present principle of construction, it must be both adjusted and adapted for the description of Cotton to be cleaned, more especially as regards the size of the seed. The same gin will not clean equally well two articles that differ so much as the Native and American do in this respect. 16. I have no idea what the description is of the new machine called the 'Macarthy Gin' (which is shortly expected). It is represented as equally well adapted for every variety of Cotton, but if it be a gin, and its principle of construction is not widely different from those now in use in this country, I will venture to predict that it does not prove equally successful with the two descriptions of Cotton above named; and any intermediate accommodation would only prove injurious to both varieties. 17. Owing to the small size of the seed of the indigenous Cotton (which does not exceed one-third of that of the New Orleans), and also from the shortness and tenderness of its fibre, there can be no doubt that, for the cleaning of it, the roller is the best and safest appliance, if its performance could only be expedited by the application of mechanical power to the Churka. I have been for some time engaged in endeavouring to effect this, and I hope now with some prospect of success. 18. The further information obtained from the experiments in early sowing will be furnished in a separate communication. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, G. F. FORBES, Superintendent Cotton Gin Factory.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023655389.0x000005_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/160, ff 24-27</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023655389.0x000005</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/160, ff 24-27</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Printed copy of letter no.19 of 1859 from G.
