Si r, I have the honor to advise having despatched to you by registered post, a parcel containing a gold watch and chain t and to request that you will forward the present f in my name I to Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani of Katr. 2. It is desirable to send the present by a trustworthy person;so if there is any difficulty m finding such an mdiviaual 9 you will retain the parcel with you until further instruct i ons. I have the honor lo he, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Offg:Political Resident m the Persian Gulf*- - ■No. 93, dated Bushire, tbe 26th April 1902 (Confidential). From— Lietjtenant-Colonkl C. A. Kemball , Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. T have the honour to report that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein has recently received a message from Sheikh Ahmed-hin-Thani, brother of Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani of El-Katr, to the effect that, if he is taken under the protection of His Majesty's Government, he will reside at any place in Katr approved of by the Government, and further that he will hold himself re sponsible to keep the seas round Katr free from pirates,/ind will co-operate with His Majesty's Government and the Chief of Bahrein in any matters which may concern them on the mainland. Air. Gaskin's letter to me on the subject is forwarded herewith. 2. It is not necessary for me to discuss the status of El-Katr which is well known to the Government of India, but I would invite a reference to the letter (Secret) No. , 0 )5, dated 8th September 1893, from Lord Kimberley to the Government ol India, which was forwarded under Foreign Department endorse ment No. 2146 E., dated 12th October 1893. The policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the El-Katr coast is here clearly enunciated, and liberty of action prescribed in the matter of 'making such 'treaties with the Chiefs of El-Katr as may be considered desirable'. 3. The Government of India will be aware that for many years past the state of affairs in El-Katr has not been satisfactory. Inland disorders and piracies at sea have been of frequent occurrence, and a constant menace exists to the peaee of Bahrein, in the maintenance of which His Majesty's Govern ment is so intimately concerned. The prosperity of Bahrein is now on the increase, and l am confident that, if some arrangement can be made whereby the tribes inhabiting El-Katr may be brought under efficient control and the adjoining seas rendered safe, the effect on the prosperity and trade of Bahrein will be beneficial. Under existing conditions, all we can do towards obtaining redress for our subjects or Bahreinis who may suffer loss by piracies, is to attach such property of the Katr Chief as we may be able to lay our hands on in Bahrein. This arrangement can never, in my opinion, 'be satisfactory and may not always be feasible. Boat expeditions are rarely possible in the case of piracies which occur off Katr, as it is often impossible to obtain full and satisfactory information as to whence the pirates emanate. Moreover, in many cases, it is believed that the crimes are committed by the l&gt;eni Hajirs who have no fixed place of residence and who cannot be dealt with by a boat expedition. 4. I am, therefore, of opinion that, if I may be authorised to enter into an arrangement with the Chief of Katr whereby his independence is recognised and a promise of protection from interference by other Powers given to him, on the condition that he is responsible for the maintenance of order in Katr and for the prevention of piracies by sea, most satisfactory results may be expected to follow. His Majesty's Government would not, I believe, be prepared to allow the Turks to extend their authority to any other place on Katr besides El-Bida which is already occupied by them, and, indeed, any such extension of authority by the Turks would be greatly to be deplored, as disturbances both on land and sea would surely follow, experience having shown that Turkish # t ufficiently eflective to ensure the maintenance of order and to suppress piracies. Undoubtedly the best arrangement would be to obtain the consent of the Turkish Government to withdraw their garrison from El-Bida where they are in reality only on sufferance, and which cannot be of any real importance to them, but I fear that this is out of the question.2 5. There are, of course, many other points which will have to be con sidered before a definite arrangement with the Chief of El-Katr is entered into, ior instance, it would be necessary to make further enquiries as to the actual position occupied in Katr by Sheikh A limed. His brother Sheikh Jasim is the actual Chief so far as the tribes are concerned, but so far as dealings with the Turks are concerned, he has retired in favour of Sheikh Ahmed. Sheikh Jasim is over 80 years of age, and before any arrangement is made with Sheikh Ahmed, it will be necessary to find out more about his position and how the suc cession to the Chiefship will devolve on Sheikh Jasim's death. Again, the question ol the choice of residence on Karr by the Chief with whom we enter into the arrangement will ha'Ne to be considered. The probability is that some other place than Zobara on the opposite coast of Katr will be found to be more suitable, on account of the proximity of the pearling banks. I would, therefore, ask that this letter may be considered merely as an ad interim report submitted for the purpose of informing the Government of India of the wish expressed by Sheikh Ahmed to enter into relations with the British Government, .and I would solicit the instructions of Government as to what action I should'take. Meanwhile, 1 have told the Assistant Political Agent that there is no objection to his meeting Sheikh Ahmed should the latter visit Bahrein, as he talks of doing shortly for the purpose of seeing Sheikh Esa, and hearing what he has to say, without, however, making him any promise or offering him any encouragement whatever. In conclusion, I would beg to remark that the reference made by Sheikh Ahmed in his message to Mr. Gaskin regarding his leadiness to co-operate in matters on the mainland probably refers to the murder of Sheikh Salman-bin-Diaij, the cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and his followers. There is little doubt that, if Sheikh Ahmed were assured of our proteciion, he could arrange to bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime. I have the honour to report that Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Muhammad Thani of Katr is anxious to come under the protection of His Majesty's Government. For the last two years he has been periodically sending me messages to the effect that he is desirous of meeting me privately, and on each occasfon hinted that he wished to obtain our protection. He recently sent a more urgent message with one named Abdur JElahman Wazzan to the effect that, if His Majesty's Government will extend their protection to him and his follow ing, he will be glad to reside nt any place in Katr which the Government may think fit, that he will hold himself responsible to keep the seas round Katr free from pirates, and that he will co-operate with the Government and the Chief of Bahrein in any matters which may concern them on the mainland. Sheikh Ahmed is a wealthy Chief and consequently is influential with the nomad tribes, and his influence and prestige would rapidly increase directly it is known that he enjoys our protection. Also, any settlement in Katr under our protection will quickly expand and draw away most of the inhabitants of El-Bida. The piracy question is an important one, and I need hardly point out the desirability of having a responsible Chief to keep the Katr coast clear, and I am inclined to think that Sheikh Ahmed could keep the Bedouins in check in this as well as other respects. I am not sufBciently acquainted with the history of Katr to offer any definite opinion as regards the rights of the Chief of Bahrein to that district but I understand from the Chief that Zobara is the only place in Katr to which he can lay claim. Should His Majesty's Government decide to entertain Sheikh Ahmed's proposal, I am of opinion that it may be arranged with the Chief of Bahrein to permit him to occupy Zobara on terms to be settled No. 56, dated Bahrein, the 22nd March 1902 (Confidential).

The occupation of Zobara by an hostile Sheikh would, of course, be a menace to Bahrein j but if a treaty of alliance is concluded by the two parties, the enforcement of which is guaranteed by the Government, no doubt all apprehension of danger will disappear, especially as I understand that some old Bahrein families who many years ago left the islands and settled near Lingah intend to return and occupy Jan which is due west of Zobara. Bringing Sheikh Ahmed under our protection at Zobara Would be an effectual stop towards establishing our policy of not recognising the claims of Turkey to Katr, at the same time diminish the number of places on the main land from which Bahrein can be threatened, and draw a line across Katr to prevent Turkish encroachment towards the northern end of the peninsula. I would strongly urge the careful consideration of the question now that the opportunity offers itself. Turkey is now turning her attention to strengthening her position in these regions, and she may go so far as to establish herself in a manner from which it may be difficult to dislodge her hereafter.

I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, has received information from Sheikh Ahmed-hin-Thani of Katr, to the effect that he had received a letter from the Deputy Governor of El-Hasa, in which it was stated that the Turkish Government had decided to send four more regiments of infantry to their territories in those parts, and that the Wali of Basrah and the Mushir (Commander-in-Chief) were to accompany the force.

Mr. Wratislaw farther explains that what really happened was this that, after the disaster to the Ojair-Hasa caravan mentioned in this office diary entry No. 2, dated 8th May last, the Turkish authorities decided to send one battalion—about 400 men—to El-Hasa; that they wanted the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Steam Ship Company's lightering steamer the ' Dwina ' to take the men, but failed to come to terms, and that it is now said that the Mahsousse Company's steamer ' Adana which recently took troops from Constantinople to the Yemen, is to go to Basrah for them and will probably be accompanied by the gun-boat ' Kilid-el-Bahr which was despatched from Constantinople last year for the Persian Gulf, but which has not yet come out of the Ked Sea.

I have carefully considered the subject and coifrespondence in Your Lord ship's despatch No. 203 ol the 7th instant, and beg to offer the following remarks:— In the first place, I do not think it is possible to justify a Convention with Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, of El Katr, on the ground of the delay which has occurred in the cancelling of the appointment of the Mudir of Wakra. The Ottoman Government have agreed, although reluctantly, to annul the appointment, and Mr. Crow's despatch No. 25 of the 16th ultimo shows that, although action has been delayed, the Wali does not deny that he has received instructions in the sense desired by His Majesty's Government, o:c that he w r iU attempt ultimately to evade their execution. In my telegram No. 218 (Secret)* of the 14th November 1903, I carefully • Pro. No. 289, secret e., May 1904, Nos. 234- refrained from expressing the opnion, as Your Lordship's despatch under acknow ledgment seems to infer that an arrangement, such as the Convention with the Trucial Chiefs, did not involve any departure from the policy of maintaining the political status quo in the Persian Gulf, to which His Majesty's Government have declared their adhesion. The question seemed to be one essentially requiring careful consideration, setting its urgency and advantages against £he ill-feeling which it will provoke in the minds of the Ottoman Government, and seeing how far it could be justified as giving His Majesty's Government the right to restrain foreign interference in El Katr without attempting in any other way to disturb, vis-a-vis to the Turkish Government, the status qtw. This is one argument that will be of much use in reconciling the Turkish Govern- jent to the Convention, although I should also remind them that it was only a continuance of the agreement made in 1868 with Sheikh Muhammad-bin- Thani, referred to in the India Office letter of the 20th May. In any easel would suggest, should his His Majesty's Government decide in favour of concluding a Convention with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of the Trucial Conventions, the expediency of doing so in as quiet and secret a manner as possible, and basing their action upon the necessity of acquiring pow r er to suppress piracy, and to maintain intact the pearl-fishing rights of the Arab tribes on the coast. I do not consider that it is Your Lordship's desire that I should express my opinion on the merits and necessity of the policy that prompts the Government of India to advocate a Convention with the Sheikh of Katr, Ahmed-bin-Thani, as there are others far more competent to give a valuable opinion upon thissubject. Bt I would venture to point out to Your Lordsliip that at the present moment we are threatening Turkey with an armed expedition, to be manned by Bmhreinese and supported by England, to avenge the murder of iSheikh Sclman, committed by the Almurrah tribe in revenge ior the murder oi some ol their people: tuat t has been decided to establish a British Post Olftce at Kowei^,, and to attach a Resident to the Sljicikh ; and that we are at the same tim^ insisting upu; u removal of the Turkish military post from Bubian Island, as also froi i Um Kasr, although not with quite the same pressure. I pass without comment the observations I have made to the Sublime Porte under Your Lordship's instructions in regard to the military operations in the Nejd. I have, &amp;c., N. U. O'C onor.

O'Conor does not consider that it would be possible to justify a Con vention with the Sheikh of El Katr on the ground of the delay which has occur red in the cancelling of the appointment of the Mudir of Wakra. Bis Excel lency is justified in stating that he never went further than to express a some what hesitating opinion thnt such an arrangement might possibly be defended as not necessarily inconsistent with the maintenance of the status quo, if it were directed solely to the exclusion of foreign interference. At the same time Lord Lansdowne understands that Sir N. O'Conor does not absolutely oppose the conclusion of an arrangement, if on general grounds it is considered expedient. I am, however, to call special attention to his observations as to the cumulative effect of the numerous steps which are being taken in the Gulf in exciting suspicion in the minds of the Turkish Govern ment, and to his recommendation that any steps which are finally decided upon should be carried out as quietly as possible, and should bear the appearance of being directed towards the virtual preservation of the status quo in the Gulf.

B., dated the 3rd October 1904,1 have consulted Captein Prideaux. We beg to express the foUowin- views. The primary reason which Ahmed-bin-Thani has for desiring a pro tective agreement with the British Government is in order that the public knowledge that he is under our protection may strengthen his hands in helpino- us to maintain order. Publicity would thus be necessary and difficult to prevent. Secondly, we consider that any agreement to which were attached the precautions and reservations advocated by His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador would defeat its own object and would seem to imply the recognition for the first^ time of some Turkish rights in Katr. It might further preclude our obtaining completely satisfactory agreement at a more opportune season. Although there can be no question of the desirability of protectino- Sheikh Katr, recent instructions regarding Koweit embolden me to indicate Ihe evil effect which would be caused if an agreement were entered into now which the policy of His Majesty's Government might require to be withdrawn a few months hence under pressure from the Porte. Might it not be more easy to dispose of possible Turkish objections if we were to content ourselves for the present with getting Sheikh Ahmed to write a letter to the Political Agent saying that, owing to the abdication of Sheikh Jasim, the chiefship had devolved on himself and that he had decided to write and inform us that he considered and accepted as binding the agreement con cluded with us in 1868 by his predecessor ? As a proof that the above-mentioned agreement has never lapsed^ we could presumably quote the action mentioned in Volume 10, page 115, of Aitchison. As possible disputes regarding succession may make' matters more difficult later on, it is important that an agreement should be concluded before the death of the aged Sheikh Jasim. {Becened on 12th December 1904, with Political Secretary's letter No. 4S dated 25th November 1904.)

Please see your Secret despatch No. 41, dated 9th September 1904, regard ing El Katr. Major Cox considers that the|primary reason of Ahmed bin Thani for desiring a protective agreement is that his hands may be strengthened in helping to maintain order by public knowledge that he is under our protec- tionJSrom his point of view/ publicity is therefore necessary. Moreover, any /yS agreement to which were attached precautions and reservations advocated by Sir N. O'Conor would defeat its own object and imply recognition for first time of some Turkish rights over El Katr. It might also preclude completely satis factory agreement at more opportune season. He would therefore prefer to carry out the following scheme. Sheikh Ahmed should be encouraged to write a letter to the Political Agent saying that the chieftainship has devolved on himself o^ing to the abdication of Sheikh Jasim, and he has decided to inform us that he, like Sheikh Jasim, considers and accepts as binding the agreement of 1868. The agreement should be concluded before the death of aged Sheikh Jasim, as disputes regarding succession may make matters more difficult later on. We concur in Major Cox's views and recommend his proposal as the best alternative to the course suggested in our despatch No. 77 of 31st March. Adherence to the agreement of 1868 would afford some measure of control over the maritime relations of the Sheikh with foreigners. Please send an early reply by telegraph. G. I. C. P. 0.—No. 3401 F.

A copy of the Agreement of 1363 with Shaikh ^ahomed bin Sanee, on the lines^f which the G-overnment of India now recommend that an Agreement should be made ivith shaikh Ahmed, will be found in Aitchison's i'reaties, O '-* . page 1 3. i 1 hat Agreement it may be observed, was not renewed in 1332 when after the death of Shaikh Mahomed, a request for its continuance received from his son, ShaiMi Jasim, was refused by the Trovernment of India on the i j? -1 i : ) ~ oil .id that Shaikh Jasim 1 s relations with the I'urks were 'Mi HI! such as to render an Agreement with him inexpedient. ihe Cfovernment of India submit their present proposalproposal as the best alternative to the reconunendation in Mieir b -cret letter of the ?lst March last&gt; that an Agreoment should, be entered into with Shaikh Ahmed substantially resemb ling those made with the I'rucial Chiefs, and they apparently consider it essential for the attainment of the object they have in view that any agreement that may be made should be public and should not be subject to the reservations suggest ed oy li.ivl. * r. Ambassador at Constantinople, to which special attention is called in Mr, Villers 1 letter of the 13th July. So far as the matter can be regarded as a local one affecting only Indian interests in the Gulf, the balance of advantage seems to Mr. Urodrick, for the reasons given in the Tr iceroy l s telegram,to lie on the side of con cluding an Agreement with Shaikh Ahmed. But if this view is accepted and it is held that there is sufficient urgency to justify the conclusion of an Agreement, the question remains whether it would be better to sanction an Agreement on the lines of those with the I 'rucial Chiefs as recommended in the Government of India's letter of the Sl.st ..larch last, or to effect a renewal of the Agreement entered into with Shaikh Ahmed's predecessor in 1363. I'he form of the i'reaty of 1363 which the Government of India propose to revise has the disadvantage of not, ofi the faceface of it, excluding extraneous interference,though bj- providing for the reference of the Chief's quarrels to the esident, it might be held indirectly to effect that object J and it will be in the recollection of Lord Lansdowne that J - this was the one object which, in Sir I\ T .0' Conor' s opinion, justified, our negociating for a treaty at all. On the ooher hand, the form of the I'reaties with the I'rucial Chiefs, while it effectually provides for the exclusion of all outside interference,involves the exclu- ion of Turkey as well as of other nations, and would, therefore, be nore likely to be strongly opposed by the P or ^ e y and, tor this reason, Mr .drodrick inclines to pre- fer the renewal of the old Treaty of 1363. » II Mr iiroarick, r.owever, would not press the ques tion of an Agreement, if, in Lord Lansdowne's opinion, our general relations with the Turkish rrovernment make it distiiiCtly undesirable to take such action at present.

Subject to the reservation expressed in paragraph of the Polif^I Agent s letter I propose to accept his historical memorandum as generallv ror rect, as the Residency files from which it has been compiled are temporarily on loan with him at Bahrein, fhe Government of India Political Proceedings No 303 of 1875 quoted by Captain Pndeaux are also believed to be in thelilesat present lying with him, but 1 am _ having another search made here Shouk further action on his report be decided upon perhaps Mr. J. G. Lorimer could find time to check the historical summary by information which he has amassed from independent sources for Gazetteer purposes, 3. Captain Prideaux's studies have brought him to the conclusion that our recor places us in a position to modify the attitude hitherto adopted in regard to this part of the Arab Coast, and that in making the change there are three decTdTdupom t0 Ch00Se fr0m, 0ne 0f Which ' he thinks ' should be definitely They are as follows (1) That the suzerainty of the Ruler of Bahrein should be reasserted over the vvhole of the Katr peninsula, except the Al Bidaa Chief- Ue'limits 0 ' Sh0Uld be reduced t0 the narrowest possi- (2) That for reasons stated we should declare the complete independence of the Maritime Arab tribes and maintain a post and Native Acent on the Katr Coast so long as the Turks remain at Al Bidaa. ^ lha , t ''® shou,d agree to the Turks over he vvhole ofthe Katr peninsula on certain conditions, namely (a) that vve should be given a lease by the Porte of the whole mantime strip to a distance of 5 miles back from the Coast, or (i) that the RWfhffi entrU p t 'i 116 adm,n,stratlon of the tract in question to Bntish officers. Either arrangement to remain in force for a period of 50 years. Of these three alternatives, Captain Prideaux favours the last. [ egar , ds the first alternative, if we grant that the historical premises on which It is based are correct, there seems nothing fantastic in the suSon asserfioif nf ^ abstrac ^ P oint of view » but practically speaking the' mere less 'l'° fh ^ rel r s oyereignty over the Katr peninsula would surely be point- Patent a n rf Were accom P anied b y measures necessary to make it S.f u ? ' . e L , These measures Sheikh Esa is not in a position to take declaration o^af'nll R t' 3 ? b ac king from us, and in view of the fact that the wkhfn ^ - S - , Pr0t ? CtOrat e over Bahrein is not considered to be ourselves such a burden^r^heResent jum^ture. advan ' a ® e ' a ^k.ng upon C404FDThe second alternative seems to me to have the most to recommend it. We could argue that while never admitting Turkish rights in Al Katr we have not actively opposed the presence of a t few Turkish officials^ on the Coast because we hoped that their presence there might be of some assistance to us in the suppression of piracy and maintenance of the maritime peace, but that it is* an unfortunate fact that the result has been just the contrary. The notorious pirate Ahmed-bin-Selman still flourishes unchecked, and as the Porte has proved itself impotent or indisposed to take any effective steps to put down this lawlessness, we feel that we have no other alternative than to revive the whole question of the status of Katr, and now intimate that unless the Porte is prepared to retire from the Katr Coast and leave us a free hand io take measures for the complete suppression of piracy in that region, we propose to reeard the Arab tribes as entirely independent and to place a post and a Native Agent on the Katr peninsula in order to be in a better position to control the lawlessness which now exists there, and there only in the Persian Gulf. 6. Both suggestions contained in the Political Agent s third alternative course seem to be based on a fallacious estimate and conception of the spirit in which the Turks regard our policy in the north of the Gulf and on the Arabian peninsula generally. Indeed a complete re -incarnation of the Sublime Porte would seem to be a necessary preliminary to their willing acceptance of such a scheme. 7. The Political Agent has however formed the views which he expresses, after diligent research and a deliberate consideration of the subject, and though I crather that His Majesty's Government has of late been somewhat surfeited wfth difficult problems connected with our relations with the Ottoman J^ern- ment and will be loth to entertain new ones, it seems advisable that 1 should submit Captain Prideaux's suggestions without delay to the Government ot India for such consideration or action as they may on their merits be held to require.

My examination of the records, however, is still very incom- nlete and 1 have not unfortunately yet been given an opportunity of reading the correspondence which led up to the Government ot India s decision communi cated to Colonel Ross in I 874 or 1875 (Government of India Proceedings. Poli tical \ February 1875, No. 303) to the effect that the Chief of Bahreit. had nVpossessions on the mainland of Katr, and his rights there were of a very uncertain character.' a. Were it not for the outbreak of plague in Bahrein and the inconveniences and delavs imposed by the Quarantine regulations, I would have betore tins time solicited your permission to pay a short visit to Buahire with the object of diving further into your records. Such a course is at present, however, impossi ble Therefore, while soliciting indulgence if any of my present statemen s conclusions are found to be inaccurate or misleading when my more deta ed account of the history of Katr is completed, 1 am now enclosing a M e m . ora ^ dum of Katr Chronological Events which I hope will be found to be su ® cien ^ lucid and connected as to permit of His Majesty's Government coming to some definite decision as to our future policy in this legion.3 4. To summarize the main points of this history, it seems to me to be cer tain that when the A1 Khalifa established themselves in Bahrein, the Jalahima section of the Utub were able to become masters of the entire Katr Peninsula. The whole of the western coast and the northern half of the Peninsula is still dotted with the ruins of Sheikh Rahmah's forts, and in those days the towns of Bida and VVakra were merely insignificant asylums for refugees from the Oman coast and had no political importance. In 1811 A, D., the A1 Khalifa were able to acquire all the possessions of the Jalahima, and from that time to 1851 A D. or even later, their political supremacy in the Peninsula was apparent ly well recognized, though they doubtless had frequently, and towards the latter end annually, to pay ' Zikat' (tithes) to the Wahabis, and probably received no revenue from the various local tribes beyond their shares to this contribution. The nature of the supremacy must have varied a good deal, but It probably was not very different to that which the Turks themselves have exercised in Bida since ^871 A. D. 5. At some time between 1851 and 1866 A. D. Sheikh Mahomed-bin-Thani was enabled to consolidate for himself-—no doubt with the good offices of the Wahabis, to whom Sheikh Mahomed of Bahrein had made himself very objection able—a compact little dominion containing the towns of VVakran, Doha and Bida, sthe independence of which from Bahrein was practically established and ratified by tne Government of India in 1868 A D., when a formal agreement was first taken from Sheikh Mahomed bin 1 hani. 6 When the Turks conquered Hasa in 1871 AD. they claimed Katr as an integral portion of the Wahabi dominions to which they had succeeded, but as this district had only paid ' Zikat' in the same manner as Maskat, Bahrein and the Oman Trucial Chiefs had often done, the contention of the Turks could not be accepted as valid. 1 he fact, however, that the Sheikh of Bida, whose inde pendence we had practically recognized in 1868 A D. and his son themselves -went voluntarily and deliberately under the Turkish yoke, places a different aspect upon the affair, and the opinion which 1 now hold is that it is useless to .continue protesting or fighting against the inclusion of the possessions of the Thani family. Since Sheikh Jasim gave up the cares of administration some 5 or 6 years ago and built himself a new home at Lusel where he hopes to spend the rest of his days untroubled by the Turks, Sheikh Ahmed, his brother, has succeeded to the Kaim-Makamlik and has been in constant communication with the Turks. Both brothers have numerous grown-up sons, and when both have died it is expected that there will be a serious struggle amongst the younger generation for the headship of the family. Uur policy, I think, will most profitably be devoted to contracting this Chiefship to its narrowest possible limits. My predecessor, Mr. Gaskin, has of late years tried to show that all the towns of the Peninsula are politically subordinate to Sheikh Jasim, but I do not think his arguments are convincing, and I am told that the people of Khuwer Hassan, Abu Dthuluf, Ruwes, Fuwerat, Dthakhira, Dthaayan, Sumesma and Khor Shaqiq have never paid revenue to the Sheikhs of Bida and will scout the idea of being their subjects. Business relations many of their pearl-merchants have certainly had with the Thani family but nothing more, nor do 1 think that we have ever made the Bida Sheikhs responsible for their misdeeds, but only for those of the Bedouin nomads who, receiving subsidies from the Hasa authorities, may reasonably be considered to be subcrdinate to the nearest Turkish officials during their visits to Katr, 7. There are now three alternative lines of policy which I will submit for consideration, the third being of much greater magnitude than the others. 8. First it seems possible to me that the suzerainty of the Chief of Bahrein might again be asserted over the whole of the Peninsula excluding the Bida Chiefship, if our only reasons for prohibiting his interference in Katr affairs in 1875 A.D was based on his weakness. The small seafaring tribes of the Katr coast are law-abiding people, and provided that they are not harassed, 1 do not4 think that they will raise any objections. Under no circumstances would I permit any now uninhabited portions of the west coast, including Zubara, to b^ re-cobnized, as its soil is unfertile and the pearl-banks being difficult of access from this tract, there can be no inducements except unlawful ones for people to settle there. 9. As the second alternative, the complete independence of the sea-faring tribes might be asserted, and in view of the fact that the Turks commenced the negotiations with the Sheikh of Bida in 1871 A.D., in direct disregard of their promises to observe the independence of the tribes with whom we had treaties, we might declare our intention of establishing a small post on the east or north coast of Katr for the prevention of piracies, and to maintain it so long as the Turks remain at Bida. The expenses of a Native Agent at either Fuwerat or Ruwes with a strong boat's crew capable of immediately proceeding after pirates would not be heavy and the cost could probably be recovered from the tribes who frequent the Katr pearl-banks. The fact that by this action we would be recognizing the presence of the Turks at Bida, should not deter us from continu ing to deal directly with the Arab Sheikh of that Chiefship in connection with breaches of the Maritime Peace, a right which we have distinctly maintained to be unaffected by the faithless conduct of the Turks. - 10. Thirdly, as we recognize that our interests in the Katr Peninsula are purely confined to the maintenance of order along its coasts and on the adjacent seas, and that if the administration of the Turks was really effective we should not object to their establishing their dominion over those Arabs, who are not protected by anterior engagements with us, let us offer to recognize the sove reignty of the Porte over the whole of Katr on certain conditions. These, as it is impossible for the Sultan to guarantee an effective and humane administration at the present time, should be e'ther that he should lease to us the whole of the coast from the southern frontier of Koweit, or even including Koweit also, down to the northern frontier of Oman, extending in land all the way for five' miles only, for a larger annual payment than the revenue which he at present receives, or that he should entrust the entire administration of this tract to British officers with full powers to make all possible improvements, either arrangement to be in force for at least 50 years. The Katif Oasis is only 4 or 5 miles broad, and its present annual revenue is 12,000 Turkish Liras, including the receipts from the customs and date-gardens. In ancient times, it is beiieved that the spring-waters of Katif were carried in aqueducts for considerable distances up and down the coast. There is little doubt that an administration on modern lines would enhance the revenues and ameliorate the condition of the inhabi tants enormously, but even if not much is effected in this direction, the probable eradication of the practice of piracy and the pacification of the more lawless sections will, I venture to think, repay us for the trouble undertaken. If a settlement on some such lines as these indicated can be effected by d!plomatic means, I would prefer this alternative to either of the first two which I have submitted. List of Chronological Events relating to the Katr Peninsula from 1766 A. D- to the present time, showing the relations of the Utub tribe, the Wahahis and the British and Turkish Governments with the indigenous people of the Peninsula. AW —Some time prior to the period under consideration, the Katr Penin- sula together with Hasa, Katif and all the coast up to Koweit was under the dominion of a powerful Bedouin tribe named Beni Khalid (known also on the coast as Amayir). This tribe was driven out of Koweit in 1716 A. D. by the Utub emigrants from Nejd, and when the Wahabis conquered Hasa between 1787 and 1795 A. D. the power of the Beni Khalid was finally and for all practical purposes extinguished. At the present day, in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, only small parties of the tribe are on Jinna and Mus-allamiva Islands, at Anich in the Katif Oasis and at Bida and Wakra on the Katr Peninsula. In the last- named district, where the scanty representatives of the tribe are all of theMus-a lam Section whohave long abandoned their nomadic habits In favour of the more lucrative profession of pearl-dealing, the mantle of the Benl Khalld has fallen upon the Maadhid section of the Al-bln-AII. to which the Thanl famllv belongs, who though of less noble birth have become much imbued with the blooa ot the Mus-allam through inter-marriages. j / ^f 1 .' 4 ;^ The ^ Khalifa section of the Utub tribe migrated from Kowelt and established themselves at Zubara on the west coast of Katr At this time Huwela, inhabited by the Mus-allam, was the largest town in the Peninsula Fuwerat was occupied by the Maadhid and other sections of the AI-bin-AII and Bida by a strong section of Sudan refugees from Oman. Other small and at this time apparently independent, tribal communities of purely sea-farin^ orcupations were located at intervals all round the coast except to the south ot Zubara, and the interior of the^ Peninsula provided pasturage during the cold weather to the ISayim and Manasir tribes from Oman and the Beni Haiir AI Morra and Ejman tribes from Hasa. J ' i i i- 7&lt;5 ' A ' ■ 0 -~ About ttlls year, another section of the Utub tribe named k Ai^ifl'f 16 Ii 1 i 0 ^ atr , om Kowe,t 1 and being indifferently received by the AI Khalifa, settled themselves at ' Ravelsh ' (probably either Ruwedtha or Ruwes, both of which places are on the coast a few miles north of Zubara). n S2 A. D.-By this time the AI Khalifa had peaceably extended their influence over the entire peninsula. They now attafked the Persian Governor of Bahrein and succeeded in capturing the Islands. They were assisted In their enterprise, not only by their kinsmen and neighbours the Jalahlma and by some of the AlSubah section o the Utub from Koweit but also by parties of the Musa lam from Huwela, Al-bm-Ali from Fuwerat, Sudan from Blda AI Bin Ainen ir n.^ w « w UWer , HaSSan ' Suluta from Doha . M^nanaa from Abu Dthuluf, bada (Syeda) from Ruwes, AI Bu Quwara from Sumesma and also Nayim nomads from the interior of the Peninsula. All these Katr tribesmen settled down in Bahrein, but the AI Subah returned to Koweit in the following year, and the Ja ahima, quarrelling with the AI Khalifa over the fruits of th? ^ctory, returned to Katr and established themselves at Khuwer Hassan under their leader Rahmah Bin Jabir.

The Resident called upon the Chief of Bahrein, Sheikh Abdullah, to chastise the offender. 1826 The Chief of Abu Dthabi remonstrated with the Chief of Bahrein for allowing some of the former's subjects (Beni Yas) to settle B lda - Sheikh Abdullah replied that the Beni Yas had left his territories and would not be permitted to return.

Soon afterwards, peace was concluded between the Amir and the Bahrein Chief, and the fort of Bida was handed back to Sheikh Ali Bin Khalifa, the brother of Sheikh Mohamed. The Wahabi Amir returned to Hasa. 1852-1866 A.D. —The history of these years needs yet to be further investi gated. f he circumstances in which the A1 Khalifa Governor was withdra vn from Bida, and the manner in which the Sheikh of the Maadhid, Mohamed bin Thani, rose to eminence are not known. From a letter Nos. 115—135 written by Colonel Ross to the Government of India on the 4th September, it appears that the Wahabi Amir had during this period established his own Agent or Governor, whether Mahomed bin Thani or another, at Bida for the purpose of collecting his tithes. Mahomed bin Thani no doubt must have succeeded Esa bin Tarif as the head of the A1 bin Ali, and as Bida has always been the popular asylum for fugitives from Abu Dthabi, it is not difficult to understand how Mahomed bin Thani incurred the enmity of the Chief of the latter place. 1866 An Agent of the Wahabi Amir gave the Resident a written declaration, undertaking that the Imam Abdallah bin Faisal would not injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government ' further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old ?' i86y A.D. —-To avenge the expulsion of the Bahrein Chief's representative from Wakra, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, in command of the Bahrein forces, attacked the people of Katr and destroyed a number of boats. He was then joined by the Chief of Abu Dthabi, in spite of the warnings of the British Resident, and the combined fleets sacked the towns of Wakra, Bida, Duweha and Doha with circumstances of peculiar barbarity. The Katr tribes then made an unsuccess ful attack on Bahrein, and subsequently the Resident proceeded with 3 men-of- war to exact reparation for the outrages. 1868 A .D. —Sheikh Mahomed was deposed from the Chiefship of Bahrein, Sheikh Ali was fined a lakh of dollars, of which four fifths were subsequently remitted, and the Chief of Abu Dthabi was fined 25,000 dollars (of which sum only Rs. 3,740 were realised) and was compelled to allow the persons whom he had removed from Katr to return to their ho nes there. Sheikh Mahomed bin 1 hani gave the Resident a written agreement, promising inter alia to reside peaceably at Doha (a village now merged in the town of Bida), to observe the Maritime Peace, to refer all disputes and misunderstandings to the Resident, and to maintain towards Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa the same relations which had heretofore subsisted between himself and the Chief of Bahrein. 186g A.D.—The Sheikhs of the Katr tribes including Mahomed bin Thani signed an agreement mediated by the Resident promising to pay to the Chief of ^Bahrein the sum of 9,000 krans annually through Mahomed bin Thani 'of Doha ' and by the latter through the Resident for delivery to the Chief's Agent at Bushire. ' 7 - V SeernS P ro ^^ e mo ney was the Katr contribution to the 1 at, but the point requires further investigation. The money was certainly paid for the next two or three years, but was probably discontinued on the lurks establishing themselves at Bida. On the occasion of this settlement Colonel el y seems to have decided (videh\s letter, dated the 27th October 1873) t hat while the Bahrein Chief was acknowledged to possess certain rights of pasturage, etc., on the Katr coast, he should not be held to be empowered to put to sea tor the purpose of coercing any Katr Port. In September of this year Sheikh Ali was killed by the forces of his brother Mahomed, and after a short interregnum Sheikh Isa was made Chief by the British Government. '8?/ A. D. —Rumours having reached the ears of Her Majesty's Govern- m ent that the Porte were about to send an expedition against the Arabs of theeast coast of Arabia, in May the Grand Vizier assured Her Majesty's Ambassa dor that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and did not contemplate any attack upon them, or harbour anv design to subdue them. He asserted that the true and sole object of the present enterprise was to pacify the two brothers (Bin Saud, Wahabis), to prevent the protraction of disorder, and to restore tranquillity. In June a Turkish force landed at Katif for the conquest of Hasa, and in July a deputation was sent by the Turks to Bida, and Sheikh Mahomed-bin-Thani was persuaded to hoist the Turkish flag and to accept the Sultan's suzerainty. /8?2 A. D. —In January the first Turkish Military Detachment was landed at Bida. 1873 A. D. —Sheikh Isa, the Chief of Bahrein, expressed a wish to re-estab lish a garrison at Zubara for the purpose of checking the intrigues of his rebel lious relative, Nasir-bin-Mubarak. Colonel Ross reported to Government that in his opinion '!:he Chief had not the power to protect the tribes residing in Katr, and that he had advised him to remain neutral between the Turks, Wababis, etc. 1874 A. D. —A party of Beni H^jir, described by Colonel Ross as a ' tribe of Nejd,' were defeated at Zubara by the Navim tribe, whose Chief was des cribed as ' a kind of feudatory of the Sheikh of Bahrein.' In the same year, a party of the Beni Hajlr from the vicinity of Khor Sha- qiq on the east coast of Katr chased and plundered a boat belonging to a British subject. Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani paid the compensation. 1875 D.—The Government of India definitely warned the Chief of Bahrein that the consequences would be upon himself if he became involved in complications on the mainland. The Sheikh replied that he submitted to the orders of Government, but that his rights to Katr (the whole of which he had claimed as subject and tributary to Bahrein) did not in consequence become invalid or extinct. 1876 A. D —It was found that Sheikh Jasim-bin'Thani was paying 9,000 or 10,000 krans per annum tribute to the Turks. 1878 or A. D. —Sheikh Mahomed-bin-Thani died. 1879 d. D. —On a Bunniah at Bida being ill-treated by a Turkish Official, Mahomed Agha, Colonel Ross applied for redress through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and the Turk was removed from his appointment. In this year a section of the A1 Bwu Quara tribe removed from Bida to Fuwerat, through jealousy of fasim-bin-Thani, because the latter, as the nominee of the Turks, had obtained the ascendancy at Bida. The move gave much satisfaction to the Chief of Bahrein, and Sheikh Jasim accused him of having instigated it. 1881 A. D. —On the 9th March, Sheikh Jasim wrote to the Resident that his authority did not extend over the whole of the Katr coast, that under the treaty of 1868, he was only responsible for Doha, Bida and VVakra, that the Resident should order the people of the ports, such as Fuwerat, Ruwes, etc., to migrate and settle down in the writer's country and become subject to him. Then would he be responsible for all disturbances. At present he had fears even for his own property. In December of this year, Sheikh Ahmed, the brother of Sheikh Isa, landed on the west coast of Katr with about 200 followers for the purposes of sport. Sheikh Jasim sent a deputation from Bida to welcome him and invite him to an entertainment in the interior. Sheikh Ahmed insisted upon Jasim's coming himself to greet him where he was, which the Bida Chief accordingly did, and subsequently Sheikh Ahmed accompanied him to his camp. 1882 A. D. —Sheikh Jasim expelled all the Bunniahs from Bida with con siderable cruelty. The Resident visited hirn with 2 men-of-war, exacted an indemnity of Rs. 8,000, and caused the Bunniahs to be re-admitted. 8/SSj A. ZX—-The Porte protested, and on the 7th May Lord Granville wrote to Musurus Pasha thatthe claims of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Katr coast have never been admitted by Her Majesty's Government,' and, on the 22nd September, that Her Majesty's Government were not prepared to waive the rights, which they had exercised at intervals during a long period of years, of dealing directly with the Arab Chiefs of the Katr coast when necessary, in order to preserve the peace of the seas and to obtain redress for outrages on British subjects or persons entitled to British protection. /£$? A. D. —Sheikh Jasim was compelled by the Resident to pay Rs. 6,400 as compensation to British Indian and Bahrein subjects who had suffered from outrages committed by his dependants. iSpo A. D. —Sheikh Jasim suggested to the Wali of Basra the desirability of establishing Turkish posts at Zubara and Odeid, two places which were claimed by his rivals the Chiefs of Bahrein and Abu Dthabi respectively. The Wali approved and also ordered the establishment of a Customs House at Bida. This caused Sheikh Jasim to change his attitude and subsequently to refuse to carry out any part of the order. The Wali then proceeded himself to Bida, and two hostile encounters took place between the Turks and the Arabs, in which the former suffered consider ably. Sheikh Jasim then made his submission and received a free pardon. A few days before the commencement of hostilities Sheikh Jasim had appealed for British protection and asked to be permitted to reside in the northern portion of Katr within the Sheikh of Bahrein's jurisdiction. No reply was apparently given to him. i8gs A D. —A division of the Al bin AH residing in Bahrein quarrelled with Sheikh Isa and fled with their Sheikh, Sultan bin Salama, to'Zobara, where they were encouraged to settle by Sheikh Jasim under the Turkish flag. A British naval expedition proceeded to Zubara, persuaded some of the Al bin AH to return to Bahrein, destroyed and captured a number of boats belonging to those who refused, and caused the place to be evacuated. The recalcitrant portion of the Al bin AH under their Sheikh removed to Bida. igoo A. D. —A small fight occurred off Wakra between some Amamara of Bahrein and Al bin AH of Bida. The particulars were enquired into by Mr. Gaskin, and the Al bin Ali were adjudicated to have been in fault and were fined by Government without any reference to the Ruler of Bida. In this year, 4 piracies were committed by parties of the Beni Hajir off Khor Shaqiq. Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani, who had now relieved his brother of the duties of administration, was informed by Government that he was responsible for the control of the Bedouins residing in Katr. igo2 A. D. —The Turks proposed to appoint Mudirs at Zubara and Wakra in Katr, Odeid in Abu Dthabi, and Jezirat Amayir (Jinna Island) which latter is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. The first three appointments were opposed by the Government and the Porte eventually gave way and recalled the officers who had started to join their appointments. The Sheikh of Wakra, however, a son of Sheikh Jasim, has been granted a salary for no apparent reason. G. C Press, Simla.—C404 F. D.—3-805,—67—R.

Bahrein regarding a recent visit of the Pirate Ahmad bin Salman to Doha of A1 Bidaa. 2. I am addressing a friendly remonstrance to Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, on learning the fact that the pirate was entertained by one of his relations and that his son made no attempt to capture him. I do not think it would be politic to do more than that at the present junc ture. Nor would it be advisable to recognise the Turkish position at A1 Bidaa in any way, by making a communication to the Porte on the subject; but as a proof of the fact that the Turks do nothing to help us in coping with piracy, occasion might arise when it would be useful to us to quote the fact that this notorious pirate does not hesitate to stroll into a port where they are by way of maintaininef a garrison.

With reference to this office Diary Entries Nos. 163,168 and 174, dated respectively the 9th, 16th and 21st July 1906, I have honour to report that about 3 weeks ago the definite news was brought to Bahrein that Ahmad bin Salman the pirate had come to Doha in Katar. 2. He first went to Sheikh Abdallah bin Jasim, the local headman, but the latter refused to entertain him and he then went to another member of the Bin Thani family. Shaikh Abdallah bin Ghanam, who received him more or less hospitably and apparently meant to allow him to stay as long as the pirate wished. 3* ' communicated the information I had received to the Commander of H. M. S. Redbreast, ' who went as soon as possible to the Katar Pearl- banks, remaining there a few days, and then returned to Bahrein. 4. I am informed that Ahmad bin Salman's presence in Doha has caused a good deal of anxiety among the Bahrein pearlers, but in my opinion it is not likely that the pirate will commit piracy on the Pearl-banks east of the peninsula as he knows that the consequences may be serious for his Katar friends if he does. 5. There is no doubt that the presence of H. M. S. ' Redbreast ' in these waters has had a very pacifying effect and that it was extremely necessary, but I fear that there is as little likelihood as ever of the pirate's dropping into our hands, until the Naval authorities can make arrangements for boats to cruize unawares along the shores of the mainland.

Major Nimet Effendi's account is not so fantastic as these Turkish are, but it may be as well for me to mention that Sheikh fasim bin Thahi had informed us the day before that his son Abdullah was away in the inte^nor in connection with a caravan robbery, and this we found to be the case. Major^ Nimet hfrendi having sent down a representative to meet us with an invitation to come and see him, I saw no reason to refuse, and found him very pleasant and hospitable I informed him of the rumours which were abroad regarding Ahmed bm Selman and said I had come to warn Sheikh Tasim and his sons of their obligation to suppress the pirate. So far Major Nimet Effendi's report is correct but the language which he claims to have held with us about the necessity of consulting the VVali, etc., is purely imaginative. As the Government of India are aware from Captain Prideaux's recent reports, Ahmed bin Selman had since appeared fearlessly in Doha of A1 Bidaa and was allowed to depart in peace. ' G. C.

The above being the state of mind of the Shaikh of iiahrair. &lt;j&gt;r. I ; 13 ^IviserB i do not think one may be aurpriaed at the three revuesta made by Shaikh Abdullah in London. To turn to the three points in question. ^oint i'he Civil Commiaaioner atatea in his ^o.i..98Q dated 50th October 1^1^ to 'Zinneremo'^ London, that the matter waa for all practical purposes settled when the Order-in-Council waa brought into force. There are still pointa however over which a ruling ia required, ^a I understand it the term 'neighbouring Arab Rulera' refers to the inhabitants of ^atar peninsula and Nejd. Is it intended to refer to the inhabitants of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, H-dramant, Yemen etc the inhabitant! of all which places are to be found here trading at all times? In other words are local resident aubjecta of the Hulera of Oman, fuwait, Zanzibar, hfljflu/and inhabitants of Hadramunt and Yemen to be considered under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain or under that of the political Agent ? a ruling ia required on this point as Shaikh laa certainly thinks he should control them. point 3. I have nothing to say except that up to the day of his departure my predecessor waa carrying on a correapon- dsnce with the Shaikh of Bahrain over thia very subject. The Shaikh had dismissed a member of the 'Majlis al Urfi' and had appointed another member without the knowledge or approval of the Political Agent - The circumstances suggested an attempt to make a test case to see how far the political Agent would be supported. The political Agent ? contended that under the Order-in- Council he had every right to bo consulted in the matter and refused&amp; to raoogniae 'llajlia al Urfi' until ahull h withdrew hla nomination, y pradeceeaor i^ent away at this stage of the cria^s and it has been left for me to settle the tangle, i certainly consider the urder-in-Oouncil is clear on the subject and should be insisted on. In the meantiiae the Majlis al Urlxs sittings have been suspended pending settlement of this vexed question. The Questio njaf_Zub_ ara . ^* / 1 h-tve been through a great many files on the subject and have consulted confidentially various local people of prominence, without of course divulging the reasons for my questions. Ihe conclusions i have arrived at are that it would be distinctly unwise to allow Shaikh Isa to oooupy Zubara. On the following prounds: (a) ohaiKh Abdullah bin Jassim of Qatar jrould strongly resent the ShaiXh of Bahrain again getting a footing on the Qatar peninsula. He is a weaker man and Zubara in the hands of Shaikh isa would be a pistol at his head always. (b) bhaikh Abdullah bin Jassim would certainly object to the development of a new port on the peninsula of Qatar since it would at once divert all trade from Dohah (Bida) to Zubara an I he would not only lose a large amount of revenue at pre sent accruing from the Customs house ^1 Johah but would stand every chance of seeing; Dohah entirely disappear as the sea port of Qatar. (c) Ibn Saud similarly would take offence at a revival of the port of Zubara under Shaikh isa^ jurisdiction for lAfe like reasons to (b) above as such a port would mean the kill ing of his new trade centre of O'Jair. It should be noted that the harbour of Zubara is naturally much better than that of either Johaii or Q'Jaip fcnd with the Shaikh of o^hrain actually compelling all Bahrain trade to go to the mainland through his port of Zubara the end of both Abdullah bin Jassim's and Ibn Saud's ports would be certain and quick. As matters stand a good deal of coolness already exists between Ibn oaud and Shaikh Isa owing to the latter having recently instituted a 5^ tax on goods passing through forfor O'Juir even though auoh goods never leave the d^hr^in Ouetoraa house. Ibn oaud oontenda thut Shuikh leu should only tuks demurrage charges (or Arthiyah ) In my opinion the suggestion of ohaikh isa's that he be allowed to revive a ten yeur old controversy should be nipped in th j bud* ihe ne»Y nove is obviouily an attempt to extend his po-vwr territorially and financially at the expense of ibn 3aud and Abdulluh bin Jasaim and will only end in trouble, further 1 consider it is the thin edge of the wedges to ohaikh Isa laying afresh his claim to be ruler of the whole peninsu- la of «&lt;atar, which claim was definitely X gather quashed some fifteen years ago. 1 attach a small sketch map to illustrate my remarks re: Zubara.

MFaiORArfJOM. Reference your Memorandum No,3S73l/6/l5 dated 3l8t October 1919. Ky rlena regarding the three points raised by the Shaikh through ShatWi Abdullah are us follows:- ' ^ (l). In asking for equal rights with other Arab rulers tho Shaikh forgets the following pointa:- (a) that both he and his father were made Shaikhs by the British Government and I think it more than doubtful whether they would have retained their positions but for the support of the British Government, It results that the British Government is trn hia responsible for the good government of Bahrain to a great^extent than in the case of other Arab Rulers fy^crt-o^ . tZu y. (b) Xhat^tho Persian and Turkish Governments both claimed the Island as part of their respective Enpires, But for the British support doubtless one or other would have taken Island. (c) That the immediate cause of the British assuming charge of Foreign subjects in Bahrain was the tyrannical behaviour of the Shaikh and his relatives to Persian subjects BBft culminating in an attack on them in 1904: this was followed almost imroediately by an assault on the German representative of V/onckhaus and Co.. but 'or our intervention the Shaikh would have been invoiyed with Persia and Germany. (d)(■1) That hia Uovernraent is singularly inefficient and vi'- .k arw is not nearly as good as tlta most of the othetr Shaikh.i. itn toiidency is to exploit the Islandsiind i^heir inhabitants for the benefit of the A1 Khalifa and one or two leading Arab families j*-. In the circumstances it is hardly to be expected that the ohaiKh of Bahrain should be on axactly the aams footing as t&gt;ther Arab Chiefs. As regards the question of subjects of Arab states, the file about the Bahrain Order in Council is not here at present, so I cannot refresh my memory. My recollection tunnigx however is that the whole difficulty was about Hassawis and Kataria fror- the sia-.nland i.e. Arabs of immediately neighbouring States. I do not think it was intended that Uuacatis, Handramantia, Yenania etc ahould be handed over to the Shaikhs Jurisdiction. I do not think the Sultan of Mu^, contemplates such a thing as this. Muacatis coming with claims to Bahrain generally get a letter from the Political Agent Muscat at the request of the Sultan. Bin saud in many of hia letters to the political Agent asks the latter to lock after his subjects, and apparently doea not contemplate their being dealt with by the ohaikh. in the circumstances I think that before handing ^JurladicUon^rer Kuwaitia, Muscatis, Handramantia.Xemania 9tCA /f.^L. Shai ^ Sh0Uld bS a8k0d t0 produce hi9 agreementa with the fcgfc|| of these places. A (2). it has hitherto always been recognized that the Arab rep^esentatires in the Majlis are appointed by the Shaikh, subject th,. a-oproval of the Political Agent as representative of the protecting Power. I thihk this practice should be continued. The Political Agent would never disapprove ^ faTr7,y suitable man, and the Shaikh has only to refrain from appointing thorough ly objectionable persons^ to enjoy practical freedom fron interference in the matter of his nominees to the Majlis. The procedure is recognized in the Order-in-Uouncil and should, I think, be maintained. (3). Zubarah - a note has already been submitted by the First AsslstantAssistant Reaident during my absence on tour, whioh deals with the historical aspect of the question. As far back as 1371 the Government of India instructed the Kr Resident to shaikh of Bahrain from interfering with mainland of rCatr on account of the doubtful character of hi 3 alleged rights and influence, - and this vfaa repeated in 1R75 Gulf (p.905 Gazetteer of Persian/ and foot note) * In 1895 the Al bin Aii occupied Zubarah and would actually invaded have/tMxaiMfll Bahrain, if their fleet had not bren destroyed by British Gun^boats (see pages 983-986 Geizetteer of Persian Gulf). In the circumstance a ^tre should continue to refuse to pay attention to shaikh Isa's pretensions to Zubarah. I doubt if zubarah is much good as a port, being very shallow, bu t it is probably as good (ir-re^. rather «cr bad) as Dohabu and Ojair, and I think the political Agent Bahrain is quite right in his view m to the probable effect of the creation a port there on Bin saud and Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim. In conclusion^! may add that I agree with the political Agent in thinking that recent utterances by President Wilson have had a bad effect on Shaikh Isa and shaikh Abdullah as on so many other people all over the world. Shaikh Abdullah's recent visit to Europe has doubtless increased Shaikh Isa's idea of his own imDortance. eut-Colonel, Deputy P 0 litical Resident,Persian Gulf, U&lt;x ~c^, . / / 6 _ ^ fylf. % Si £3 \M it i ^ (f ai r . f ^ 1 iM — v r- I ' M-* ^ :Zc fT— c.
