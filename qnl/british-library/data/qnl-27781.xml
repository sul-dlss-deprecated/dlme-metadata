Not to be reprbduosd) Tne to!lowing is a sumary pf the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 6 th Nov^iber 1923, Although there are still rumours of an early Irnaislc attack to Buraa in the neighbatrhood of Rajil there his been no actual change in the situation during the past month. It ia said that Izzet Bisha has advised the Jmm not to attack the I dr i si Tihama or to occupy it against the wishes of the people as this would compel the Idrisi to throw himself entirely on British protection. One open despatch and one another secret despatch from Angora have been received by Mahmud Nadhim Bey. i The contents are said to he that the Turkish Government have not settled the future of the Yemen though they have&amp;ecided not to reoccupy it. As however the in- :! habitants desire Turkish protection and suzerainty to save them from the greed of foreigners,the Government will give this matter their deep and sympathetic comtsidarations The .Arab Chiefs are then invited to sen representatives to Angora to discuss the best form of future Government. A reference is made to the Turkish officers stillstill in Taman and it is stated that the Assembly will shortly make provision in the Budget for payments to them. The Turkish Officials are said to have been bitterly disappointed by the contents of these despatches. The Offici^ils are coming to Hodeidah daily en route; for Turkey,tut Captain Fa&amp;l-ud~Bin reports that they ar«i mainly dependent on private charity for subsistence living received nothing from their Government. Mahmud Kadhlm giw;a them letters of recommendation and Captain R.^l-ud-Bin doss all he can to assist them. The chief Turks at present in Hbdeidah are Colonel All Buhl Bray and Zaferia Akif Kffandi late Public Prosecutor in Sanaa., It Is said that Mahmud B ;,dhir Bey hirself fill shortly come clo\fn from S*naa to return home. Bill BAW Althoughi Bin Baud* a deputation has bean unable to reach S;,ma owing to the hostility of the tribes between Saada imd Sanaa who suffered severely in the massacre of pilgrims last hot weather, its mission has not been altogether fruitless as the Imam has sent it a reply to say that Hhe regrettable incident should I now be considered as closed' and he is agreeable to be one with Bin Baud against any foreigners or the friends of foreigners. Two Syrians feyati Bey and Mahomed have arrived in Sanaa giving themselves out to be messenger from Bin Bud but the populace imagine them to b© Sherifian emissaries. Bhssen ibn Aidh who had returned from Mecca to !bh&amp; has now bean sent to Biadh 'to sea Bin Baud*. Asir*&gt; 4&gt;S8S -A 2. 1 B Sayad All the ytamg Idrisl arrived in Lobaim with an escort of 400 tribesmen and accompanied by Shaikh Tahiya Zr,kaxi,Bh^rif Bamood, fesi Abdur Katean al TJtmi i nd Tfc : \zX All Utalf. The last named,a boy of BO ha.s more influtooe over the young Idrisi than any other person at present* Captain F sl-ud-Din reports that he fills the Joint posts of Chief Judge and Confidential Secretary* Captain Faal-ud-Bin had two interviews with the young Idrisi during which he spoke Ms mind freely as to his immature intellect which makes him a prey to flatterers and sycophants. He attributed Sayed Mahomed the late Idrisi*8 success first to that ruler’s outstanding personality,then to the extrema misgovern- ment of the Turks and finally to their misfortune in 3 wars. Hone of these causes hold good at the present I time and Sayed All must rely on good government and not on pious ejaculations. At present the misgovernmant was upsetting the whole country,and as a proof of this tha Quhra Shaikhs had told Mahomed T Mr Kidman the Idrisi r, omr f andar at B Jil, that they were quite able to look after themselves and would bless the day when the Idrisi troops withdrew from their country. Captain F zl-ud~Din added that he was glad to V see that Sayed Mustafa was not taking affair® into his own hands,and that in tha cup of bitterness he could see only two drops of consolation,one ms that the country was still peaceful and the ogher that the British Government wishes tha Idrisi Government to be strong. SomeSaiie of %he&lt; Idrisi’s compel lor $ supported Captain F&amp;sl-ud-Din in Ms words^ by murrors of approval,but at tbs conolusloa tlio Idrisl^s only rsply was 'an idiotic $%8&amp;3i a ^idoncuthed followed by an imbecile * Captain Fa^l-ud**^in furtbor rsports tbs approaching marriage of the Idrisi tith the daughter of an oil preseer o^ed liassan Mi^hosied Hiyaxa , a bad character. Saye-i Muatbfa has been the victim of prolonged projnganda directed from F^ypt mainly by his brothers but he is now re mining ituch of his former influence. His star is in the ascendent and the flatterers kiss ais feet, but It is not to be expected that the attacks on air ^111 cease. He has hod rruch difficulty in restraining the young I dr l si from writing a letter to Mslrnd Hadhim Hey, to say that he hated the foreign influence in his country, recognised Mustafa Kemal as bis virtual over-lord and wae ready to carry out his behests. Bayed Mustafa suggested to the Idrisi that Mahmud fedhim ^.0 working for the Imam, Who wished to get possession of something to sho r his perfidy to the British, -JTABIS&amp;H ISLAmS &amp; £ALIF T Some of the IMislan &lt;x?uxtiars have been attempting to mik.® money out of the Farisan Island aM Sal if concessions and it is said that they ar© in correspondence with Italians at M&amp;ssawa on this subject. sl ave .mn:_ 180 slaves now ih Midi arrived during October andand They ^ere shipped from Tajura and th© neighbourIne s©a coasts in small Danksli -oliows. Captain Faxl-nci-Din raports that it is impossible to expact Arab cooperation in suppressing the slave trade at the present stage of their civilization. Tna 2aidis Imre ocoupi.xi 'Bom tom md the country c:f Hawaii tribe. T&amp;&amp; trice, which expected to put up a strong; resistance against tne dia not do so. On the contrary,it I is reported that they assisted the Zaidis in their advance against Bada tom. Seeing tae Oimige of atti tude on the part of ui&amp; Huna^anis the Tafa and Audali reinforcements returned to their respective countries. The Upper Y&amp;da Sultan writes that he had to recall his tribesmen from Be-la owing to the treacherous conduct of the Htme&amp;aais who did not hesitate to come to terns with tne s 2 ddis, Be adds that als tribean are concentrated long the Yifa border Jro guard against a possible Zhidi advance from the direction of Beda. The 2Saldi advjtno© into Berdt has unnerved most of the tribes in the Aden Protectorate, who have all been clamouring for assistance in arms and ammunition and -money. The leading Upper X&amp;fa Chiefs are new in Aden seeking the active intervention of British troops and aeroplanes against the SS&amp;idis, but I have assured theai that no i,-'mediate attack is pending and that in my case the first desideratum is unity among themselves. A united Yafa would prove almost uncon-* could be given. The Imam's envoy has renewed his assurance that no Z&amp;idi attack on 7afa is pending in the near future. Oting to the stage at which negotiations with the Imam have arrived I believe trait his assurance is sincere and so had no hesitation in passing it on to the Yafad Chiefs. Tae Alawl Sheikh is still detained at Nadira. It is reported that the Znidls have deiBanded 1600 as ransom for his release and that the Alawl tribesmen are endeavouring to raise the money. (Sgd) T.E.

SCOTT Political Resident, Aden.1 0th ADm Hiws LETTER Aden Residency SSC RIT. 6th Movemoer, 1923. (The contents of this letter are for the eole information of those to whom it is sent. Rot to be reproduced). The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 30th September 19 23. T1HA1A. Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob late first Assistant Resident ut Aden, now on the retired list, arrived at Aden on 12th October and left for Sanaa via Mocha on 28th October with Major Spiers. Captain Fassl-ud-Din writes that the news of Colonel Jacob’s arrival at Aden en route for Sana has caused surprise in Hodeidah and that it has greatly ■erturbed Sayed Abdul Kader of Marawa of the ^Jacob Mission’ feme. This Sayed is the most influential man in the Tiha&amp;ia. It is said that he awaits a despatch from Angora ooutnining the terms of the treaty of Lausanne before declaring himself and that when he finds himself deserted by the Turks, he will apply to the British Government for protectio/n against both the Imam and the Idrisi, in accordance with the terms of the agreement whereby Colonel JacofeMission was released in 1919. From a report submitted to me by Major Barrett, who recently visited Hodeidah, Idrisi affairs appear to be in a very unsatisfactory condition. The Xdrisi’s rule in Hodeidah rests on a very shaky basis. His Government is bankrupt and can no longer pay their troops nor supply them with military stores and the Tihama triber areara waveM® in their support of him. Captain Fazl-ud-Din reports that in connection with the massacre of the Saida pilgrims in Asir by a fahabee force, in June last, Ibn Baud has sent a mission to the Imam. This mission has been held up at Bada as the K country between that town and Sada is inhabited by the fellow tribesmen of ’fie murdered Zaidis. Before the mission can proceed ilia Imam has to negotiate safe conduct with these tribesmen* c? I am now in receipt of further news regarding the fighting between the Imam and the Idrisi in Jabel Malhan, from which it appears that the Zaidis who were reinforced after their last defeat delivered an attack in which they defeated the local tribesmen who resisted them* It is stated that the Zaidis subsequently occupied trie whole of Jabel Malhan without meeting any further resistance, and followed tills up by an indiscriminate massacre of the inhabitants* “} Ihe biggest BheiMi of Jabel Malhan offered no resistance to the Zaidis but wont to the Zaidi Commander to make his submission, taking with him his son as a hostage and two bulls to offer as sacrifice. He killed hie bulls before the Zaidi Commander who, however, had both the Sheikh and his son killed over the bulls* Ihe next Imamic offensive is expected on the Jabel Bura-Reima front. Preparations for it are in progress. The Sana agent of the Political Officer, HodeicMi reports that the Italians have signed &amp; commercial agree ment with the Imam through the Imamic Anil at Mocha and that they have started a monthly service between Mocha and Mossowah.The Zaidi force referred to in my last letter arrived in Beda territory and occupied mi Umar a mall tract in Beda territory after overcoming the very feeble resistance made by the inhabitants of the place numbering about 350 mm. The Humakani and other sections of the Beda tribes are expected to out up a strong resistance against the Zaidis, Fighting is reported to be in progress, in which a large nunber of the Upper Yafa and Audali tribesmen have joined on the side of fee Beda tribesmen. The townsmen in Beda are neutral. The Zaidis are now reported to be preparing an expedition against Yafa, as their attempt to secure fee neutrality of fee Yafais, while they attacked Beda has failed. ( About a month ago fee Sheikh of Wadi Shaab whoiii in Aden, received a letter from Shaab saying that the Zaidis were expected to arrive there shortly for fee annual collection of tithes. In forwarding fee letter to this office fee Sheikh threatened to make terms wife fee Zaidis unless we took steps to prevent them from entering the Shaab territory. The Zaidis are reported to be intriguing with fee Attifi tribes (Subehi)* They have appointed the Akil of on© of fee sections of this tribe as their agent and have sent Inmmic soldiers to assist him in collecting tithes from fee people. The Kotebi Sheikh who made his submission to the Zaidis recently, is endeavouring to win over the Dsmbari and Ahl Abdulla sections of Radfan, who have hitherto refused to submit to fee Zaidis. Captain Fazl-ud~I5in has received a renort of fee 1 endinglanding of 100 slaves at Taif about the 22nd September. iSiey are said to have been shipped from the French Somali coast oy two Dankali dhows. They will gradually be transhipped to the Hedjas. (Sd.) - T.E.SCOTT, M.G.

Hot to be reproduced). The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 30th August 1923, On the advice of Bayed Mustafa, the Sheikh of dirk has removed the blockade against the Hedjas and Kunfida* In my last letter, 1 forwarded the report that the Imam had delivered an attack against Jabel lialhan on the 6th August, resulting in a victory for the Idrisi who, after having occupied the whole of Ja^el Hufash and ari, had besieged the Imamic force in Shaf&amp;min * These places were subsequently recovered by the Imam. Captain Kazl-ud-Din now telegraphs areport that the imam delivered a fresh attack on the 25rd September and succeeded in occupying certain important centres. Captain Kazi- ^d«I)in adds that great atrocities are said to have been committed by the &amp;aidia in the places they have( at Taif . They left Taif on the 26th July and on their way call ad at Khokha. Captain Fasl-ud-Din reports that at the instance of fay ad .Mustafii an .^n^in ear frost Aden inspected the salt mines at Calif a short time a^&lt;o. it is understood that fayed Mustafa has asked, for an estimate of the salt lying there and the means of conveyance available for its shipment* The Kotebi Sheikh returned home from his visit to the Officer Commanding, ifadra, apparently pleased with the treatment accorded to him by the faidis. The latter are said to have given him robes of honour for himself and his grandson and a present of $500 and 100 Kadh&amp;a of Jowari* The Sheikh has left his nephew as a hostage with the &amp;aidis* After returning home he wrote to the abdali Sultan informing him that the Zaidis had appointed him Amil of Radfan and that he will have under him 30 faidi soldiers including one Officer. For the present he had left these soldiers at Bala, as before he brought them to Radfan he wished to ascertain from the Radfan tribesman whether they would accept him ae their Amil. The terns of his settlement with the Saidis ace stated to be that in addition to the monthly subsidy the amount of which is not yet known to me, he will have the right to levy road dues at the rate of 1 annas and his nephew Mukbil Abdulla at 4 annas, per can el load. Further, the beikh will be entitled to 1/lGth of thej4l J 4j the revenue he collects for the Zaidie from the Radfan country. It is rer^ortod that the Radfan tribaBmen fire not satisfied with these terms. The Sheikh's grandson who has hitherto strongly opposed his grmd father's settlement with the Zaidia, la reported to have left for Dhala at the pressing' invitation of the aidis. It is reported that he Lower Yafai Sultan (in the Men Protectorate) has applied to the Imam's iuils of Dal a and lladra. for armed assistance against the Kadli Ml tm, who is reported to have encroached on the Lower Yafa border and occupied some places belonging to Lower Yafa. The Ami Is wrote to the Ketebi Sheikh inquiring as to the advisibility of sending a Zaidi force to the Fadli country through Hadfan and as to whether he could himself cooperate by sending his mm with the force. The kotebi Sheikh is said to have advised the Amils to defer their advance pending consolidation of hie own position among hie tribesmen who are not satisfied with the terms of his settlement with them. The Sheikh is said to have further advised the Midis that in order to obtain control over the whole of Padfan, it is necessary that they should first occupy Beda. From reports received from various sources imamic forces appear to be concentrating at D&amp;mar for the invasion of Beda, and an advanced party is said to have left for Rada, which is about 3 days march from Bada. Since the asBaseination of the Bada Sultan reported in my last letter, Beda internal affaire havehave been in an unsatisfactory state. The late Sultan’s cousin hasan bin Ahmed, who has been intriguing with the ^aidis and who paid a visit to Hana a short time ego, hm usurped the Sultanate* -he late 'Vltan’s sons have fled and taken refuge in the country north of Beda* 'deports continue to be received regarding £aidi intrigues in Upper Yafa.

ASIR. The Sheikh of Birk has declared a hloekade against Kunfida (King of Hedjaz’s port) and th-e dedja* generally^ The sea off Birk is patrolled by an armed dhow of the Sheikh and dhows bound to Jeddah and Kunfida are made to discharge their cargo at Birk. A notifica tion of the blockade has been sent by the Sheikh to merchants in Ho del dan. The cause of this high-handed action on the part of the Sheikh is stated to be the establishment of a new customs oost at Mali by King Hussain and the imposition of taxes on goods coming from Birk. The Hedj as authorities have also confiscated specie belonging to certain merchants of Birk on the ground that the export of gold from the Hedj a* is prohibited. Captain 'asl-ud-Din reports that the Hashmite Government s.s. *Rushdi w arrived at Hodeidah on the 17th August, with 100 pilgrims on board belonging to the caravan of 3aIda pilgrims, which the 3ahabee s attacke d in As ir, in J une 1 as t. According to the account of these pilgrims the caravan composed of 3700 pilgrims, (not 500 as reported in my last letter) out of which only 200 escaped,( 2 ) escaped, the remainder having been killed by the Wahabees. These 200 men went to Mecca, where they were very kindly treated by King Hussain, who gave the pilgrims left for their homes overland and the | remaining 100 are sent to Hodeidah by tiie King on the 'Rushdi* free of charge. Captain Fasl-ud-Bin reports a severe outbreak of small-pox at Cedi and in its vicinity. expected attack of the Imam against Jstel iialhan was delivered on the 6th August and that the lurisi assisted by local tribes has occupied the whole of Jabel Hufash and Bari and has besieged Imaraic force Jabel Hufash is to the north of Bajil and Sari is to the north of Hufash and well to the east Fighting has also taken place on the Raima- Bura front, though on a small scale.

Two other Italians landed at Khokha on the 26th July from a dhow, and after spending about 4 hours on shore, left again in the same dhow. A Turkish Colonel, Kinan Bey, who had been imprisoned by the Imam for attempting to escape from the Yemen last year, has been released, and has arrived at Hodeidah en-route for Constantinople® Ymm (mm.mmum.. Captain Fazl-ud-Din informs me that the Turkish newspaper 'fauhid Afkar ,s has, in its issue ox the 11th Sulhajjah 1341, A.H.

In discussing peace terms with the Amil of Dhala, the Kotebi Sheikh is sard to have expressed his desire to be appointed Zaidi Amil of Radian and to be allowed to retain for himself 1/lGth of the revenue collection he makes lor the Zaidis. The Zaidis sent an invitation to the Ahl Abdulla Sheikh (referred to in my last letter) and another, a relative of the Kotebi Sheikh, to come to Dhala. The latter replied that they could not do so, as they were friends of the British Government. A rumour states that the Off icer Commanding, Nadra contemplates sending a force under the command of thethe Kotebi 3heikh against them and other Hadfanis who have not yet submitted to the Zaidis. The Alawi Sheikh is reported to ha?e been sent back to Dhala from Madra. The Abdnli Sultan informs me that Ali Ba Sal lam has received no presents of sheep, goats, etc., from Ibn el /*’azir # as reported in my last letter, but that Ali Ba Sal lam who married recently the mother of the young Haushabi Sultan received $150 from Sheikh Qaid Saleh, the Mil of Maviya, as a wedding present* It is reported that a Zaidi forse which was advancing against Beda and other tribes in our Protectorate has been recalled by the Imam on receiving the news of the attack by Ibn Saud on the Z&amp;idi pilgrims in Asir. Tne Beda Sultan is reported to have been killed in a family quarrel. Hie Sharif of Behan left for nis country. He has been given an additional 10,000 rounds of amrnunition to assist him to resist the Saidis, should they advance against his country. Captain F&amp;al-ud-Din has received information from Sana, through Jamel Bey, nephew of the QX-’fali ahmud Nadhiia, that Beda ana Behan have tendered their hostages to the Imam through the agency of a Sayed who is aiming at a confederation of Yemen Chiefs under the hegemony of the Imam of Sana. Two risdramaut Sayeds, Abdur Rahman ibn Obaidulla Cs-Baqqaf and Mahomed Akeel, are said to be active prop^ators of this cause. The latter has gone to Transjordinxa via Egypt for the purpose of spreading a pro-Imamic propaganda in Arab countries. The Imam’s envoy in Aden, the Qadhi Abdulla al Arashi, is said to be the real author of the scheme. The Imam has issued a general invitation to all chiefs in the Aden Protectorate, including Mokalla to finitei l ) (5) ionite under hia suzerainty and he promises H to keep every country under its om chiefs and vest in them the po*er of managing its affairs and ports”. He further adds that the British Government is in favour of the policy of Arab unity. This invitation appear® to be a part of the Arashi ’n scheme mentioned above. (3d.) - T.IS.SCOTT, M.G.

All these arms and ammunition ore imported from the fedjar, especially from edina and i abag. 2-A , Fajor Barrett, my First Assistant, touched at Hodeidah on 18th July on the way to Ksmaran. Owing to Italian feeling on the subject of their Hodeidah Consulate and the Idrisi* s refusal to ermit Italians to land without special permission, ajor Barrett did not go aataore, but Bayed.

He was assured by Major Barrett that such a nove was hardly conceivable. Bayed .Mustafa stated that the Idrisi was not in any way perturbed by the Ira am* s preparations to invade the Tihama, but asked for m rupoly of arms and ammunition. he was told to write to the aden ! esidency f where his request would receive consioeration. '•elation® between the young Idrisi, Bayed /di nd his advisers appear to be far from cordial ot oresent. TIHAMA 3 . The much-talked-of attack of the Imam ago. in at Jabel Halhan is still expected. The Imam is said to have detailed 10,000 troops for this offensive alone and to h- ve disbursed to the troops two months nay in advance. ?ive thousand of the troops have already loft for Jabel Malhan. The total number of the Idrisi troops in Jabel M&amp;lhan is 3000, exclusive of the tribesmen of lalhan, whose nu mber is not known. The Imam has further reinforced the HeIma-Buraa front with 2 C 0 Cmen. His object is to en,-'®we the Idrisi on all the fronts at one and the same time. 4 # Captain Faxluddin informs me that on the 22nd July, he received a visit from the important $uhra JheiKh, I email, baghwi, referred to in pare, 4 of my letter of 7th June. The Sheikh told Captain Jazluddin that the Idrisi*s death had. considerably altered the views of the Q,uhra people about the Idrisi Government and the future of their country, ffe said that he and Bayed Abdul leader (referred to in ny last letter) wish to discuss the latter question Hth Bayed Mustafa and that the latter had promised to meet them in August, when he intends to come to Hedeidah on a prolonged visit. Captain Hazluddin says that Sheikh Baghwi is not ne rvous^ v nervous about the cominp: Imamio offensive. Captain b’azluddin has sent nje a copy of a letter dated COth June to the Idrisi from fahomed Salim, who describes himself as acting for the Governor of Eritrea, also a copy of the Idrisi-s reply dated 10th -u; . , .m his letter the vent after referring to the arrival of a new Italian Governor at Asmara, and his desire to continue friendly relations with the present ldris1, state0 that the establishment of an Italian j Consulate at Ho de id ah will be a distinct advantage to the Idrisi as the Italian Consul will support his claims to the c-ou '' try 311(1 3180 endeavour to strengthen the friendly relations tetween the Idrisi and the Italian Government. The afrent adds that as there is already a British representative in Hodeidah, it is .essential that tne Italians should also have one there in the interests of trade. The Idrisi in hi 3 reply states that he desires to continue the friendly relations which subsisted between the Italians and his late father, but th-^t he cannot permit the Italians to establish a Consulate in Hodeidah as they had none in his father’s time. The Idriei adds that he is opposed to the establishment of Consulates, be they of any n tions, as the Arabs do not know h&lt;wto deal with them, and that Captain Fazluddin is his Doctor.

The ilotebi Sheikh who stood out for so lonp apainst Zaidi attack gnd Zaidi intripue has at last pone to Dhala to make terms with the 2kaid.is. In a letter to me announcim his decision he states that his tribesmen h^ve forced hi i to take this eteo owinp to their fear of renewed warfare with the Zaidis md the prolongation of the negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Imam. He has written to the Abdali Sultan reporting his arrival at Dhala. Ye says that he was welcomed by the Anil of Dhala who met him on the way with a large number of soldiers and that a salute of 4 puna was fired on his arrival at Dhala. I have since heard that he had to pay for this salute. The Kotebi Dheikh was accompanied by 260 of his tribesmen. The Zaidis, ho ever, allowed him to retain only a few followers in addition to his two nephews who are with him. All the rest were sent away and have returnedto their country. The Kotebi Sheikh was to be sent to F&amp;diira after the Bakri Id on the 2**th July to settle terms with the Officer Commanding, Nadira. I have not received any news yet of his departure.

(Not to be reproduced.) The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 7th June 1923. ASIR. Captain Fazluddin who visited Sabia recently reports that when he arrived there on 27th ’'ay, there was a large number of deputations from various Idrisi tribes in Asir and the Yemen, including on® headed by the Sheikh of Birk, which had come to take the customary oath of allegiance to the young Idrisi. Captain Fazluddin says that the Sheikhs of the Yemen deputation, after they had taken the oath, addressed Sayed Mustafa saying that as the Idrisi was yet young they expected him (Sayed Mustafa) to take the management of the entire Idrisi affairs into his own hands. The Sheikhs added that they had an anxious time after the death of the Idrisi until they heard of his (Sayed Mustafa's) arrival. The Sheikh of Birk, Ali Abdo, and Sayed Mustafa En-Nami, the Idrisi Amil of Shaba in, who headed the Asir deputation, also spoke in similar terms. In the course of his reply Sayed Mustafa announced his intention of returning to Egypt as soon as the Government had been properly organised. The Sheikhs expressed them selves strongly as to the desirability of Sayed Mustafa's tim continuedcontinued residence in Asir, eiore bayed ? ustafa's arrival his opponents had useo. evei*y endeavour to prejudice the young Idrisi against him by representing him as a Pro-British emissary. An article in this sense published in 'Al Abram * lent then support in their object. Bayed ! ustafa after his arrival seized an opportunity offered by the presence of the young Idrisi and all his advisers of refuting this accusation. Captain Fazluddin states that Sheikh Mohamed Salim, the Italian Agent, referred to in my last letter, visited Jizan ostensibly with the object of paying a visit of con dolence to the Young Idrisi on behalf of the Italian Govern ment but in reality with the object of obtaining permission from the Idrisi for the establishment at Hodeidah of an Italian Consulate, and an Agency of the 'arittima Italiana Company, which would have the right to hoist the house flag of its Company whenever one of its ships was in harbour. Sheikh I ohamed Salim also asked for leave for the Italians to open other mercantile firms in Hodeidah. Sayed Mustafa replied that Hodeidah was not conquered by the Idrisi but it had been handed over to him by the British Government to be held pending a final settle ment of its ownership, but that the British Government had given a promise to uphold the Idrisi’s claim to its permanent - ownership. Sayed Mustafa added that as the British Govern ment which was entitled to special consideration from the : 1 Idrisi Government in the matter had not yet made any such ijrequests, he could see no reason to allow an Italian Consul to hoist the Italian flag in Hodeidah before the British had done so. Referring to the recent visit of Signor Fares to Hodeidah,Hodeidah, Sayed Mustafa reproached the Italian Government | for sending their Consul to Hodeidah without having first | obtained the Idrisi’s permission. Sayed Mustafa did not object to the Italian Marittima Company's agent, who was already in Hodeidah, remaining there as such, but said that he could not allow him to hoist his flag. As to Italian merchants, Sayed 7 ustafa replied that the Idrisi Government had no objection to Italian traders who were natives of the Red Sea area, establishing their business houses in Hodeidah but the same concession could not be allowed to European Italians whose safety could not be guaranteed. There was no objection to their sending their native agents for business in Hodeidah. There is no change in the situation in Asir except that the forces of the King of the Hedjaz have retired from Mahail to Barak. Captain Fazluddin states that one of the deputa tions from Asir which visited the Idrisi recently, brought a letter signed by Sheikh Ib-El-Faraj, the Chief Sheikh and numerous smaller Sheikhs of Beni Shihr, in which they expressed their loyalty to the Idrisi and their desire to come under his rule. Until recently, this tribe was in friendly rela tions with King Hussein, but the Chief Sheikh Ibn-Il-Faraj, who is in some way related to King Hussein, appears to have fallen out with him, Hence the overtures to the Idrisi. Captain Fazluddin reports an explosion in the Idrisi powder magazine in Jizan, as a result of which 4 men were killed and 3 wounded, mm- There appears to be seme reason to believe that theImam is making preparations for an attack for the recovery of Jetil : alhan and a general invasion of the Tiliama, He held, a council recently at Bouda, at which a number of chief® of the powerful tribes of the highlands were present, i Yafai Akil, recently arrived from Sana, stated that the &amp;&amp;idi surrender of Ifalhan last March was a great blow to the Imam, who made no attempt to hide his feeling® on the subject. Captain Fasluddin inform® me that Malhaa is well , fortified by the Idrisi, so its recovery by the Imam will i presumably be difficult. Captain Fazluddin has forwarded, to me copies of 3 letters, from the Imam and Ibn el fasir. Governor of T&amp;iz, to Sayed Abdul Qadir bin .Ahmed al Ahdal of far&amp;m, the most influental Mansab in the Tihama. The lettera ? the original®,; of which were shown to Captain Fassluddin. secretly, were written in April and May last after the death of the Mriil* their object being to induce the Ian sab to start a movement in the Tihama in favour of the Imam* They follow the usual line of abuse of the Christians and their helpers i*e., the Idrisi. Gheikh Hason * oh&amp;med Yahija Fashiq, the chief of the Southern baraniqs and his cousins have gone to Jisan to take the oath of allegiance to the young Idrisi. Sheikh Mohamed Ahmed Noman, the Imam’s Amil of Hujjaria, ha® arrived at Mm on route for * acca via Hodeidah, on pilgrimage, I had a few samples of the Sheikh Said coal referred i to in my letter of 8th Fay, examined, here* The coal is reported to be of no value* ADMEM .FiiOTEGTURATS:. fh® 1mm haa sent a reply to ray protest renarding tue arrest oi the Alawi 3heikh in which he says that inquiries aooui the Alawi's miscorKluct on the trade routes hare not been completed and he is still detained pending the relief of a hostage supplied by a former Alawi Sheikh in 1919. 'he Padli dispute has been settled. The parties have agreed to abide by the terms of their agreement of 1919 under which the old Fadli Sultan recognized Sultan Abdul Kader as his successor and appointed hus administrator of his country during his life time. The Haushabi Sultan and the pretender, Ali Fa Sallaai hare case to a settlement, by which Ali % Sal lam has acknowledged the young ILaushahi Sultan as his overlord but has assumed the administration of the country as Regent. They are both expected to come to Lahej shortly to report the result to His Highness the Abdali Sultan. 'Tie F. akhdumi Sheikh referred to in paragraph 9 of my last letter has not yet come to Lahej. 1 have advised him to settle his differences with the Abdali Sultan and have asked him to infom me whether he has paid compensation on account of the recent murders of Kata’ci tribesmen. In 'f the meantime the tribal bickering® between the AMali® and the B&amp;tttsia, who are regarded as a mh tribe of the l akhdiini, continue* ^ Sheikh Haji Ali Askar, the ex-Nakib of Mauaatta \ (Upper Yafa), writes that he approached the imam with a view &gt;' to the restoration of Shaib to Mausatta, Tim Imam replied that he could not comply with Sheikh H&amp;ji’s requests as he had no guarantee that the Yafais would not rmini him again* The Imam, suggested that the ' ausatta people coulj:! show himtneir loyalty by supplying him with mercenaries. He would then appoint the Nakibs of Maus&amp;tta as his Anils. The Imam has released all the rtausatta captives in exchange for a hostage given by the latter. Some of the Yafais are reported to have arranged vdbii Bayed Yahya, the Officer Commanding Nadira, to meet him at Kaiaba. The object of this is not known. The people of Ahmadi and Mihrabi, subtribes of the Amiri, are reported to have killed two Zeidis in Bin Huresh along the Amiri border and Sheikh Kaid Saleh, the Imam’s Amil of “aviya, made preparations to punish the of!ending tribes, but the murderers have now been surrendered y the Haush&amp;bi headman, with whom they had taken refuge. The Anil of Dnala is reported to have sent 4 loads of grain to the Kotebi Sheikh, who is the mainstay of the Radfan combination against *Aaidi aggression. The Sheikh whom I had invited to Aden at first replied to the Am.il that owing to illness he was unable to pay him a visit, but later reports ( show that he has now decided to make terns with the 2 ieidis. / iiie arrest by the Zeidis of his neighbour the Alawi Sheikh, whose release I have hitherto failed to obtain, appears to 1 weighted the scale in their favour for the moment. So long as our negotiations with the Imam make no progress, and we are unable to counter efficiently the Imamic propa ganda supported as it is with the threat of the painful con- j sequences of holding out against the Imam, it is most H difficult to persuade the tribes of our Protectorate from 3 /ielding eventually to Zeidi pressure.

Captain Eazl-ud-Din, the Political Officer, Kodeidah, informs me that at the leginning of last month, the Jdrisi Governor of Hodeidah, under instructions from the young Idrisi selected 13 leading merchants of Hodeidah to go to Jizan for the purpose o r taking the oath of allegiance to the Idrisi. 3 Madrami merchants who are temporary residents of Hodeidah were included among the number but declined the invitation on the ground that they were British subjects and so could not take an oath of allegiance to the Idrisi. 'he rest asked for time till the end of the Ramazan, but their request was not granted. They were asked to get ready to depart within two days. On the day of their expected departure however fresh instructions were received from Jizan to send 4 only of them under an escort. They were accordingly despatched on the 6th May. In a letter to Captain Eazl-ud-Din dated 13th *ay, Sayed Ifcstafa explains that this treatment of the merchants w^s due to a regrettable misunderstanding on thethe pnrt of the Kodeidnh Governor. He himeel* w^s ill nnd did not know of the orders sent from Jizan till he he^rd them c^sunlly from the young Idrisi only the d^y previous to the ^.rriv^l of the merchants at Jiznn. The merchants were well treated at «iizan and were allowed to return to Hodeidnh at once after taking the oath. Captain I’azl-ud-Din eays that the merchante returned to Hodeidah on the 15th May, quite satisfied with their treatment at Jizan and full of praise for Bayed Mustafa. 3. Captain Fa si-ud-'*} in reports that an Italian agent named Sheikh Mahmud Salim returned to Hodeidah on the 5th '.ay from Jizan, having obtained the Idrisi’s permission for the Italian merchants, referred to in my News letter dated iGth April, to open a trading house in Hodeidah. 4. It is reported from Mar awn that on the 1st lay Sheikh Ismail Baghwi, one of the Q,uhrn Sheikhs and Jamil Bey, the nephew of the ex-Vali Mahmud N'»dhim had ^ long secret conference with Bayed Abdul Kader al A hdel, the most influential an sab of Tarawa. Subsequently Sheikh Ismail Baghwi came to Hodeidah. 5. The Imam’s agent at Jibuti is reported to have returned to Zabid after a stay of about 8 months there. He is said to have told the Zabid Amil that tie Great Powers have recognised the Imam as the Independent Huler of the Yemen excluding Aden and extending as far as the boundaries of the Hedjaz and, that he has brought with him certain important communications ^rom the ^reneh Government addressed to IrmmYahya.

At rry request, the Imam’s envoy, the Ciadi Abdulla al Arashi sent a telegraphic reminder to the Imam and hac just received a reply from the latter to say that he has despatched a reply to rry letter of 19th April by a messenger. B. The Abdali Sultan informs me that there is no truth in the story that the Imam is despatching a force to maintain order on the Dhala-Lahej trade route. 9. In connection with the recent murders of Kobati traders, subjects of the Imam, near Lahej, reported in my last letter, aeroplane flights over the Takhdumi country, | where a few bombs were dropped on the chief village, had I the result of bringing about the submission of the Mansuri Sheikh who despatched a messenger on behalf of himself and the nkhdumi Sheikh to the Abdali Sultan offering to make terms with him. liis highness has asked r or two hostages from the offending tribe as a preliminary to any settlement that may be made. OnS' On the return of* the aeroplanes, a letter wns nddreened by this residency to the Hkhdural Sheikh and he -Aras warned to submit to the terms imposed in connection wit ; the recent outrage as well a® the previous complaints pending against him, A reply has now been received from the Sheikh in which he disclaims responsibility for the act© o' the hasusis who, he says, are not his tribesmen. The Basusi used Hkhdumi territory a© ^ base for their r^-id on the trade route and acted with the connivance of the akhdumi Shaikh. 10. The dispute between Sultan Abdul Kader and the old B’adli Sultan referred to in tit/ i^at letter ha© not yet ended. The trouble continue© and ha© resulted in murders and looting on the trade route in the Fadll country. 11. Our Yafa correspondent’ contradicts the report that the brothers of the Nakib of Husatta received presents from the Imam and that the latter has ordered the release of the Yafa captives with him. The correspondent states that the Imam sent them away saying that he wished to have no dealings with them, unless he received letters from the headmen of the Yaf» tribe* He, however, promised to make the brothers Officers in his arny if they will bring him recruits from Yafa. Whichever story is correct, the brothers appear to have forfeited the esteem of their tribesmen by going to Sanaa, though they have now been permitted to return to their homes. 12. According to the Yafa, corresoondent, the Rasasi Sultan of Beds, within the Aden i rotectorat e, went recently to the Imam to ask for assistance in order to punish the4 the Humkani section o'* his trile, with whom he has been fighting.

Sot to be reproduced}. .tlie following is a Bummary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 10th April 1923 to have accepted the young Idrisi. The country is quiet. The Shaikh of Mrk has written to acknowledge the new ruler hut has not paid him a visit. between the Imam and the Kashid and Bakil tribes against recently. The Shafai chieftains referred, to in para 8 of my la-of 1 tier are said to be well treated by the Immn, The Imam probably finds Xbn el .Va-oir, the Governor of Tai« in the wrong but owing to the political importance of the latter, the Imam seems powerless to do anything against him. In the meantime, a rumour is afloat that Ibn el Wazir who has not complied with the Imam*s summons to come to Sana has been collecting a large force to defend himself in the event of the Imam using force to exact his compliance. by Shafais in the neighbourhood of Aden as he wishes to use the laid!a against the Idrisi. my last letter did not go to Mocha but landed at Bubab and Sheikh Said. He returned to rerim on 3rd April and told the Assistant Resident, berim, that he had found coal at D&amp;bab aIa. the northern and southern tribes are reported j here is eg id to be a move to bring about peace whom the Imam has been carrying on an unsuccessful campaign V The Imam is said to be replacing his 2-aidi troops The Frenchman j&gt;\ Marcel referred to in para 10 of andand also at^heilch Sa|d. Hs statsd his intention to investigate the coal at the former place and tried to nroeure blaming material from the Peria Coal Company. e said the coal was of very good quality. He returned te Jibuti on the 4th April, I have asked, the Assistant .Resident, Pertra, to arrange to keep an unobtrusive watch on the doings of this nrenchnan at Rubah and especially at Sheikh Said. I have also acked the Aaslatant Resident to obtain through Shaikh Kaair Ambari of Sheikh Said or otherwise any samples of the coal, reported to have bean found. On the 14th April, the french Consul here informed me that the Jibuti authorities wanted the dhow which conveyed M, Parcel to be ordered, back as she had left Jibuti without permission* On the Xhth April, a party reported at 150 Zaidie despatched by the Imam*e Aral! at Bhala came to the Alawi country and arrested the Alawi Sheikh, Abdul Habi and the Akil 'ahomed Jana, whom they took to Rhala. They are said to be accused of putting up All Ba Sallam to molestearavans on the trade route. The newe of these arrests was reported to me by the Amir of Bhala on the 17th April, The Imam 1 ® envoy, the U&amp;di Abdulla a,l Arashi who was interviewed on the following day, stated that ho had not heard of the arrests but promised to secure the release of the uriaoners. On the 19th April, I despatched through the envoy, a telegram and also a letter to the Imam e^tpresshg my surprise at the conduct of hi© Amil at Rhala in arresting in the Aden Protectorate one of our protected chiefs. I requested him to telegraph instructions for the immediate release of the Alawi Sheikh and the Akil. I have now received a reply from the Imam saying thathe ie telegraphing to his Amil at Fadira, but as the telegramoontaina no indication that the release of the Alawi aha; ich has been ordered, I am aakinp the Imam's represen tative at Aden for an explanation of its meaning. Reports from Bh&amp;la and H&amp;dfan state that the Zaidi * !ire demanding a hostage from the Alawi Shaikh and ' JrC thr9 ^eninR to loot hio country unless he oays 'wapes to the Zaidi ooldiers who arrested and took him to Bhala. The Imam ia reported to have sent orders to the Officer Commanding, Kadira to keep provisions ready for a force of 800 soldiers, which i« bains despatched for the express purpose of maintaining order on the trade routes between Bhala and X*ahej, Tne Ahdali Sultan states that the only report he has received lately regarding All Ba Sallam’e inter* fvrence on the trade routes relates to the exaction of dollars 3 from a Jew. Ali Ba Sallam, the pretender to the Baush&amp;bi Sultanate and arch-disturber of the peace has come to an agreement not to interfere ith the trade route till after the Id. The Kotebi on his part undertakes to settle Ali Ba Sallamin* s dispute with the Baushabi Sultan* Mukbil Abdulla, the nephew of the Koiebi Sheikh has been levying unauthorised taxes from travellers and is reported to be paying a share out ofnthe collection to the Saidi Ami1 at Dhala. The Makhdumis and Basueie, sub-tribes of the Subehi, fired at a caravan of Khotatis, Iraamic tribesmen, near LaheJ, killing two men and wounding two who subsequently died. A donkey was also killed. The cause of this trouble appears to be that the Makhdumi Sheikh who has been paying a visit to the Abdali recently left hahej dissatisfied wad has sine© written to the Sultan severing friendly relations with him. The Mansuri Sheikh is add to have written a similar letter to th© Abdali. theihci Afoclali Ills ,3 sent out raouutedi pa,trots and nas warned the Haushabi Sultan of possible attacks on the trade routes in hia country. These Subehi tribesmen appear to consider that the best way to bring pressure ^ to bear on the Abdall Sultan, to redress real or fancied grievances, is to attempt to embroil him and ue with the J&amp;aldi officials. An Abdali Baiyid is reported to have been killed, i?i the Fadli country by the fadli tribesmen of Birjaj. The barkaahis, another section of the Fadli tribe, shot one of their own tribesmen mistaking him for tae bro^iior of the Upper Aulakl Sheikh, whom they wanted to kill. A dispute has arisen between the old Fadli Sultan and his grandson, Sultan Abdul ilader who is the defacto Sultan of the. Tadll tribe, m the former wishes to bequeath State lands to his son Fadl. Trouble was expected but the latest news received states that the dispute has been settled. Some of the relative© of Aulaki and the beda Sultan® are reported to have gone to Sanaa to ask for help against their respective Sultans, The brother® of the llakib of Mauaatta (Yafa) who had gone to Hadira to secure the release of the remaining Yafa captives with the Imarn, are reported to have returned with presentsof #300/^ and 5 rifles from the Imam, who has ordered the release of the captives. The auaatta tribesmen looking upon their Kaqib’s brothers as traitors owing to their visit to and receipt of presents from the Imam, have refused to allow the Shaikh# to return to their homes.

Not to be reproduced.) fhe following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 9th February 1923. AS xx\. it io reported from Asir that King Hussein has despatched a tore© tc attack Mahal1, which is at present garrisoned by a small force of Ibn Saud. This action of King Hussein is likely to give rise to serious trouble throughout Asir. With the exception of the tribes of Beni Mughaid and Beni jShihr who wish for complete independence, the people 'are either pro-Idrisi or pro-Ibn Baud. A deputation from Ibn Bond has arrived at Sabia. TIHMA. The Political Officer, Hod.eidah reports that on the 3rd February, Imamio forces delivered two attacks, one against J.Milhan, which wap. repulsed, and the other against Bait-el-Manama, by which the Imamic troops succeeded in surrounding the Idrisi troops in that place. The Imam is said to be determined to re capture J.Milhan and J.Bura and to be concentrating large forces in the vicinity of these places for this purpose. He is also preparing an attack against Urjain and Kanawas, with the object of threatening Zaidiya,Zaidiya, the Idrisi base, Abdu] Shakoor-el-Hindi, the Italian Agent at Khokha has again taken the customs contracts of Khokha and Mokha for the sums of $48,000 and $84,000 per annum respectively. He has paid an advance of $5000/-. It is rumoured in Hodeidah that a Syrian named Faras will shortly arrive there in a dual capacity of Italian Consul and Agent of the Marittima Ita]iana. A house has been engaged for him. (Up;nftr and Lnwer) Ine Imam is making a new road between Sana, lerim find Taiz. The portion between the first two places has already been completed. iiie Shafei chieftains 1 iving in the Imamic territory close to the western boundary of the Aden Protectorate conspired together to rise -against the t-im's rule after murdering Ali ibn iffazir, Governor of iaiz. The plot was disclosed to the Governor by Qaid h-'leh, nephew of Fahomed Nasir Mugbil of f’aviya, a prominent intriguer during the war. All the Sheikhs imp]icated have been arrested. Abdul Wahab Woman, the Ami] of Hujjaria, when taxed by Ali ibn Wazir with his part in the conspiracy stabbed ibn Wazir but not fatally. He was overpowered by the guards. Hany of the people of the Zuriffc. country who appear to be apprehensive of the measures which the Imam may now take, are fleeing across the Protectorate border to take refuge in the Subehi country. I have asked the Abdali Sultan to warn the Subehis not to get themselves mixed up in Zeidi affairs. ADBd PROTHOTORATK . Ali Ba Sal lam, the Haushabi pretender, hasnot complied with this Residency order directing him oo come to* Aden to explain his conduct. After the receipt of the order, he went to the Fad] i Sultan in - Abyan and wrote a letter to me asking for a safe conduct which was accorded, but in spite of this I hear that pe has now gone back to his country and has re commenced to molest the trade route. Before A]i Ba Sail am left Abyan, the Fadli Sultan approached the Abdali Sultan on behalf of the pretender and offered to bring him to Lahej for a settlement. As A] i Ba Salaam had not abided by the terms of the agreements already made, the Abdali refused to have any more parley with him. The Haiishabi Sultan, who has been acknowledged By Government has written to ask me for ammunition. I am complying with his request, as it is necessary to strengthen him against marauders, such as Ali ba Sail am, who interfere with the trade routes and lay us open to the Imam’s complaints regarding the insecurity of the trade routes within the Aden Protectorate. The Imam is reported to be intriguing with some of the Upper Yafa Sheikhs, to whom he has written letters inviting them to Sana. A Saiyid is reported to have recently visited Upper Yafa on behalf of the . Imam. I have received no definite information of the nature of the negotiations hut the Imam has released / several Yafai captives captured in the fighting of January 1920. Our news correspondent at J.Jihaf reports that an Imamic official has arrived at Dhala to take over wakf property in the Amiri country. The official met with oppos-ition from the people of J.Jihaf,* K J.Jihaf, who have sent protests to the Imam and Saiyid Yahya, the late Officer Commanding, Dhala, who is at present in Nadira.

Reima-Bura. front since the attack by the Imam’s mem reported in my last letter* Caiyid ahomed ibn Ahmad ibn-el- azir,lately Mil of asab-el-ali is reported to h ve reveled against the Imam in Oafel birr and to have proclaimed himself Imam. A large number of people of Hajja and Khauian are said to have flocked to the standard of the pretender. The pretender is a brother of Ibn el Vzir, the Iraamic Amil of Taiz. Jf:inuary 1933 ihe Idrisi anticipates an Imaraic attack in 8aafan and has despatched reinforcements. There has been continuous fighting on the The situation is quiet at present. It is reported that Hasan ibn Aidh, who ie IP I The Imam appears to have lost his popularity1 '' ' * { popul^tri ly in ; ! ajja and r?nml:m owing to certain 1 reforms he has been trying to curry out in his ar^ay j J^ 6 aid of lUrkish officers who are stili in the ! P^oola of Hajja and Hhaulan do not approve of the innovations and consider that by attempting them the Imam has broken 7 out of 14 conditions essential for a Uidi him. The Imam has also introduced new taxes which have no religious sanction and which ha himself condemned during the Turkish rdgime. hile this has been the state of feeling in the country, the Imam recently introduced strong measures to prevent the export of coffee through the Idrisi country* These measured which affected the people of Hajja and Khaulan adversely, created a general wave of hostile feeling against the Imam* %ed Mahomed, the pretender only took advantage of the situation thus created. The Imam -is- reported to have desoatched a large torca to quel 1 the revolt, and according to my latest information peace negotiations have started. f Tlie report regarding the Zeidi advance into ^eda, mentioned in my last letter, appears to be without foundation, as I have bo far received no confirmation of it, nor does the Beda Sultan referto any such advance in a letter i have recently received from him. .nli Ba Sal lam, the Haushabi pretender has m&amp;in started fighting with the Haush&amp;bi Sultan and molesting peaceful travellers and caravans passing between Lahej and Mavlya by taking from them illegal imposts I f—rr40 imposts at al Jol Mudram. r I1ie ore tender nith a mixed force of Haush&amp;bis i^rahis (Amiri) Bhambarie and Subehie, attacked the Haunhabi capital (Masemir) but after 2 days fighting was forced to retire# On that date our aeroplanes flew over Masemir and certain other places in the neighbourhood under my instructions, as a warning to AliBa ballam not to recover imposts or molest travellers. On the following day I warned him in writing ol the possible consequences if he continued to molest the trade route. 1 have since directed him to come to Aden to explain his conduct.

(The contents of this letter are for the sole information of those to whom it is sent. Not to be reproduced). The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of rqy last letter dated 30th November 1922. MIS* The Political Officer t Hodeidah f reported that Feisul Ibn Baud with his force has returned to Hiadh, leaving behind 400 men to garrison Abha uid Maiiail md that Sheikh Suleiman Pasha of Mahall who was a prisoner with Peisul has been released and permitted to return to his country on the distinct understanding that he and his tribe will henceforth recognize Ibn Band as their suzerain. Fearing an attack by Feisul Ibn Baud,the King of ' the Hedjaz had reinforced Kunfida with 400 men with 2 , big guns and 2 machine guns. These soldiers who are ! still there are said to be looting the inhabitants. mu m Having suffered continued defeats at the hands of Hashids, the Imam is reported to have made a temporary truce with them. The Imam blames the Idrisi is being the cause of the hostility of the Hashids towards him. Captain Fazluddia reports that there is a general movement of Imamlc troops behind all the fronts in the Tiharaa, though there h is been no actual fighting. During the month of November the Imamic troops on the Jab el x^ura front made a raid on a village while the Idrisi soldiers were sleeping and carried away large bootybooty, including jewellery, after killing 8 Idrisi soldiers* In order to prevent the export of coffee via Hodeidah, the Iraaa is reported to have bought 'ill the coliee at Menakha, and taken to S^uiaa, whence it will be sent to Aden. iQkMilLii inper raid Lower ) . A nephew ol Jamil Bey, who arrived in Sanaa from Syria on the 10th November, is eaid to have informed Mahmud Nadhim that a Jewish Government is to be established in P destine and has given him an outline of the Palestine Moslem propaganda in circulation. Mahmud Nadhim explained all this to the leading men in Sanaa and appealed to them for monetary assistance for tueir Moslem brethren in Palestine. In connection with this, the ima^* is said to have isked the religious head of the Jewish community in Sanaa to xumish him with a list of all tnose Jews wno have already left or, intended to leave, for Jerusalem. A report states that the installation, of a telephone between Mokha, Taiz and Sanaa has been delayed owing to some defects in the material received from Jibouti. I hear that the Imam has issued his own coinage and has notified people that they should exchange the Turkish Majidles at ore sent in circulation in the Yemer for his coins. I have received a report that the Imam his sent one Qadhi Mohsin Qalala to Jubouti as his agent,and that tills man has recently despatched percussion caps, gunpowder cartridge making machines, ammunition etc., to the Imam.rumoured 1 1» a a miasion iua recently been at S‘.uaaa and it Is/between A Sanaa and Moklia in order to draw Yemen trade to Jibouti, This news has alarmed the Ah dal i Sultan whose revenue is chiefly derived from the Yemen trade passing through his territory to Aden. His Highness suggests the extension oi our railway to our Protectorate border as ithis covers a snorter route and would he preferred by : traders to a railway from Sanaa to Mokha. 9 The situation is geaerilly quiet .trough 1 have received m unconfirmed report that Heidis have advanced into Beda within the Aden Protectorate. Last month, a party of Dharobaris.Radfan tribesmen, who reft nahej dissatisfied with the presents received from the Abdali dultan,started looting caravans and travellers on the trace route. The raids have apparently ceasea as tne result of the aming sent by this Hesioency to tneir *ikils, as i awe had no reports of further looting lately. • The Zeiciis at Dhala are reported to be levying taxes on a greatly increased scale. They tried to recover taxes from tne Radian tribes,through their countxy is not actually in tneir occupation,but met with an •unanimous refusal. The young Hauahabi Multan has quarrelled with his idviser, Amir All Ba Saleh Ba Hashim, who was also the adviser of his father. I have no definite news as yet but a hear that the Sultan has dismissed Amir All and has asked All Ba Sallam, lately his rival for the sultanate, to take his place.*31 Mrs.Hosita Forbes accompanied by Kamil Bey Fahmi, an Egyptian, arrived at Ji«an on the 25th November in a dhow from Kgypt* Her object is to travel in the interior of the country, but the iarisi has refused ner permission as he is unable to guarantee her safety. He has, however, given her permission to visit all the places on the coast as far as Hodaidah and placed his own motor car at her disposal for the purpose. On December 10th,she arrived at Hodeidah where .she is awaiting the arrival of Saiyid Mustafa from Egypt, as she hopes he may be able to obtain oermissLoi from the Idrisl for her to visit the interior of Asir. She also wishes to visit Sanaa and Saada, if permitted by the Iman. Kamil Bey Fahmi is reported, to have left for Cairo.

Ails following is a summary of the news reported since the cespatoh of the last letter dated 1st November* 1922.

The latter refused to come whereupon Me fort of Harmala was stonaed and captured. ibn Aidh fled, with Ms family, to an unknown destination. Ms cousin, Mohomed and Hasir Abdur-Hahman with their families have fled to The cause of Ion Aidh’s rising is said to be the intrigues and bribery of ing Hussein. After occupying Ibha, Peisui advanced and occupied Hahail, whose chief Sheikh, Sulaiaan Pasha had killeci 14 Somali Gendaraies in the Idrisi service last year. Sire Shaikh escaped to Mecca and having succeeded in getting assistance from King Hussein in men and ammunition, came back and. met the fahabee force in Mahal1, but was defeated. fhe Sheikh then surrendered to the Vahabees. It As said that Feisul line held out to Mn a promise of complete pardon for Ms past oonduot, provided he assists Ma in capturing Ibn Aidh. The Wahabees are reported to be moving towards Kunfida. The Iraanic force on the Bura-Reima front madean attempt to wreet two idHagea from th« Xtirisi's troops in Bara on the 34th October but the attempt failed. Ine situation on all the other fmonte is quiet. As a result of a quarrel between the iiasaraha tribesiaen of the Idriei Jaish under Sheikh Hasan Utaif nnd the inhabitants of Ob«i, one mm of the latter is reported to have been killed and one of the Masanha wounuejd.. Tise iaatter is being investigated.

They demanded 4000 dollars and have refused 3000 dollars offered to them by the owners of the goods for the restoration of all the «r vpoin looted* I do not approve ofntho idea of paying any money to the pirates in a oase like this, as such payment would only tenu to increase the ovil and multiply ease31 of piracy. As the act was committed within the Imam's territorial waters at okha, i reported the matter to him, and I have now received a reply from him stating that he is taking steps with a view to tne recovery of the Mods. Hejme promised to let me know the result in due course, foe Political Officer, i odeidah, reports the arrival at Hodeidah of two Turkish officers, formerly Imams to the Turkish Army in Sana, en route for Constantinople, have been pojmifctad by the Imam to leave the Yemen, as one of the* i» sick and the other is going as Ms attendant.

The coffee exporters who were concerned in the transactions with Qadhi Al rlcwa are eidd to have also been imprisoned. On appeal to the imam in person trie Qadhi has been released and reinstated. fortnight of September severe fighting took place in lulad**i-3haraf and liajja in which the Imamic forces received a aeries of defeats at the hands of the Hashids. In consequence, reinforcements of nearly a thousand men were hurriedly despatched under' the Command of Sharif ^bdulla ez hamim, a Commander in Cafan. troops are not receivin^^ their pay regularly, as a result of which, 150 men of the iaruii, under their Sheikh, who had not received their A for 3 months, have deserted, after looting the Idrisi supply depot at Burra, ^ome slight 1922 The Imam’s ionil of Mtnakha, Qadhi Al Akwa was llodeidaa reports show that during the first It appears from Hodeidah reports that the idrisi pay disagreementdisagreement is reported between the Quhra Sheikh, Ismail, Ba^bwi, and the Idrisi Cotmiander at Bajil, owirtf; to the latter showing partiality in disbursing the pay of the soldiers. On the night of the loth September the ^araniqs attacked the idrisi force in Mahwi, hut were repulsed with a loss of 12. On the 28th September, the Idrisi force in kahwi advanced into the Majamla country, hich is situated between Kaneuria and ttie Saraniq country, at the invita tion of Majemla kaahaikhs, who are said to have given hostages to the Idrisi. A part of the force, however, went beyond Majamla into ‘the S&amp;roniq country, whence they had to retire after a loss of 10 men. The Karaniqs lost 18 men in killed, and 6 wounded. Sheikh toed fiiini of Taif who is said to have been supplied with, ample arms and ammunition by the imam has armed a large number of men to resist the idrisi. The dheikh has also received monetary assistance. the iikil of another section of the daraniqs has also received similar assistance in arms and ammunition from the Imam-. Mast month, 100 mounted Earaniqs tried to wayly the idrisi Commander at Bajil who was returning from ; ansuria to Bajil via Tarawa. he attempt, however,was frustrated by the Cumander being forewarned and changing his route. . A later report states that the Zaraniqs made a misfit attack on the Idrisi camp in the Majamla country onon the loth October killing 7 men. The £ax*anic|s themseive eustained a heavier loss of 15 men, including 5 important men of the tribe. captain ^asj.uddin informs me that ahomed Jamil j Bey, Jahmud Hadhim’s nephew, who resides in Tarawa, left I Jiaan via Hodeidah, on the 23rd Jepternber, accompanied i by his cousin* Captain Faaluddin says that Jamil Bey had been | trying to see the Idrisi for the last five months, but \ owing to the Idriei*s indisposition he has been unable to ido so* h @ has now succeeded and has returned from Jizan | to Tarawa and has given out that he has been partially successful in his mission and will be returning to Jabia {after consulting :,:ahmud Jadhim. | ,, ^he rumour is that the mission was in connection | with vernal Pasha’s desire for a peace settlement between I f the mm and the Mrisi, and that if the Idfisi shows a disposition to come to terms he will be visited by an Xmamic Deputation* Captain Itoluddin has been informed by daiyid Abdul Hekaan el Ahdal of Larawa that Jamil’s visit ,to the Mrisi Is in connoction with a letter received by Mahmud ' Madhim from Mustafa Kama! Pasha, in which while Mahmud Madhim has been recognised as Turkish Wall of the Yemen, t under the loyalist Government, great stress is laid on the necessity of bringing about a peaceful settlement between the Idrisi and the Imam. Mahmud Nadhim is said to have sent a copy of the letter id Baiyid iibdul liacer a! Ahdal requesting him to do his best to give effect to Kemal Pasha wishes. This appears to be the request to which referencemad« in my B«n tetter of 3rd Auguet last, r«ge 2. • J ' | Lahttud nadhim is said to be expecting monetary assis- | lance from Keaal Pasha. « i hear that the French attempted to make an agree ment with the Imam for the erection of 4 wireless stations in his dominions* The negotiations fell tliroi^rh on the refusal of the Imam to pay any money till the stations had been erected and tested. A quantity of wire and 12 Cmishahs) pigs of lead have been sent fron Jibuti to Mokha for the purpose of joining Moksha to Tain by telegraph* The telegraph is being erected by the Imam’s own people* I have received Mormafelon from Captain ; A Atjsluddin, I. Political Officer, Hodeidah, to the effect that, on I bib instant, Signor Lanzoni, the Italian Cormnissloner of :■ Assab, accompanied by some Italian Officers landed at S S • iitKmdah from the It^linn chip '.asBawa' informed the people there in ax-pger &gt;ted tenns of the Turkish victor! «s \ in As ia ’-inor. Signor Lanzoni is stated also to have told the people that the question of llodeidah and the Yemen will f be settled in an exceller. manner in the near future'. ( This news caused great rejoicings among the people in Hodeidah, Open demonstrations, however, did not t: ke place owing to the fear of the Idrisian authorities there. The stories current two years ago about the imminent j return of Turkish troops are again in circulation, and it , is even said that the Imam is preparing to return to them the arms,'which they left with him, on their evacuation of J the Yemen in 1918-18. 'The latter rumour is of course without foundation, as the Imam would not consent to forfeit his valued indspe»denc«i &lt;2? ' l\ Brom later information received from Captain Fazluddin, it appear® that on the 7th October the people ot llodeidah convened a religious gathering in the Jama Mosque for the celebration of Maulud-en-Mabi(Prophet’s birthday) and the Turkish victories. Umbar Shuraee* who convened the meeting was punished by the Xdrisi Ami 1 on the loll owing day, by imprisonment for one day. near that Sheikh A1 i Otliman of Mokha referred to in m ¥ Letter dated 5th September 1922, is at present at Kedi waiting to see the Idrisi in order to ask for his assistance in recovering Mokha from the Imam, He appears to have seen the Idrisi at Sabi a or^oa only and to have been sent to Medi to await his arrival there. ASM PRmT,CTOHATl. In my last, letter, I reported that the pretender AH Ba Lai 1am had succeeded in getting the sympathy and support ot about 700 men of the Hadfan tribes and that these men were collected at Ar Haha awaiting the outcome of an inter view between the Koiebi Sheikh and the Sultan of Lahej. The Abdeli Sultan now informs me that Ali Ba Sal lam himself came to Lahej and that he took the opportunity of advising him to be submissive. The Kotebis and Dhambaris who had come with Ali Ba Sallam also gave him ' •imilar ad vice. The Sultan adds that actuated solely by the desire for the preservation of peace, he has increased Ba Sal lam’s subsidy, which is paid from Haushabi dues collected at Lahej and has also given him other financial assistance, on condition that he behaves well in the future. The Sultan hopes to bring about an amicable settlement between him and trie new Haushabi Sultan, Mohs in bin Ali Month* Theik ^ ' 1 ij.iapWB^d, act the Alidali bou^jht iAiqm ovw, A later report, however, shews that AH Ba Sal lam ib not eo Buoaisr-ive to the new Haushabi Sultan ae the .Mali Sultan, ’who has certain claims to suzerainty over the UauBhabi country, desires. He has gone to the Kadfan country and has sent a party of 20 to 30 Dhambarie to the A1 ileh-llobnt Qakia road, apparently with instructions to allowed it to proceed on the arrival of a Kotebi caravan, with which they did not interfere. A mm following the caravan, however, was attacked and robbed of 30 dollars. I have written to the Abdali Sultan for confirmation of this report. Any interference nth the trade routes gives the Zaidi leader tbn al Wazir an exnase for interfer ence in our Protectorate. i Hi jail i Sheikh went to Hndra to tender his submis sion to the Iiram. The Kijaili ia one of the Hedfan tribes and has hitherto, fought alongside the others afcainst the tion by the 2aidis and is said to be returning to Radfan to assist in the estimation of the crops for ZakatUithes). Caiyid Mahomed Al Sharai, the Aral at Dhala, who had gone oo £&gt;anaa, soi.ietine ago, is reported to have returned Agaood and Suleik. A report states that large reinforcements have left Hadira for Sawadia, along the Beda border. This report is not confirmed. It is feared, however, that the Imam He has been granted monetary assistance and recogni- to Uhola with 70 men, who will relieve the garrison of Al takingtaking; advantage of internal unrest may interfere in Be da affaire under the pretext of raftering order* The unrest in due to the misbehaviour of the Kuraakani and ihl Diban sections of the Beda tribe* They killed a cousin of the Sultan some time ago and they are nor reported to have killed another of his cousins* They are a thorn in the side of the Sultan, with whom thoy are always at 1 overheads * The Qadhi al Araehi the Imam 1 a envoy returned to Men bn 22nd October* The Qadhi brought with him two letters, couched in very friendly lvrm § from the Imam addressed to General Soott and r-ys^ff. I had an interview with him on the 24th October* In reoly to my question, he stated that the Imam had eepri the draft ohausee of the proposed treaty and, with 1 slight modificatiooE, had approved of them* The Imam,how- | &amp;t$r 9 would not rign any treaty with us, unless he got 1 1 Hodeidah* I sut-agested that m might first prepare the treaty and leave the question of boundaries to be settled later, when a representative of the Xdrisi could he called to Aden to discuss the matter with the trashi* The envoy mid that vmlmn the question of boundaries was first settled, the treaty .could not be signed. He. addad that although he had no objection to meet the Xdrisi representative, he could nm no good resulting from such a meeting, since the Imm did not recognize the Idris! *8 claim to any part of the Yemen. As, however, the Xdrisi-had entered into treaty relations with us, the Imam might not -{object to the,Xdrisi retaining Asir. X informed the Arashi that His Majesty's Government had approved of the draft clauses with a few modifications. He said he would like to see thorn but as it was late he promised to discuss them at our next interview.The Arashi complained that the Idrisi was advanca in^- into the SaBaniq country in spite of the praaiee he had made to us not to do so. 1 told him that I had not heard of such an advance. 1 added that I had written to the Imam, who had mad© a similar complaint, in on© of his letters received last month, to let me know where the advance was made and the name of the idrisi Commander concerned, bo that I could address the Idrisi, as I had his undertaking that he would act purely on the defensive. 1 informed the envoy of the two cases of piracy which tiie &amp;araniqs have recently committed and he promised to write to the Imam with a view to the recovery of the goods looted or of their value. 1 had already written to the Imam on the subject before the arrival of the envoy, but a further representation from his representative will be an advantage. ihe hotebi dheikh has come in to *den and state? that there are in Radfan, 50 men at llrkoob and 20 at Sulaik. He fears that it is the intention of the ! commander at lhala to advance further into Radfan with a 1 view to estimating the crops and enforcing payment oi | tithes. In one of the letters brought by the Arashi, the Imam states that he has issued orders for the with- drawal of tho iieidi troops. 1 have According iufome* the hotebi Uheikh Jhat hie fears fire grounulasa and that the Zeidis will not interfere with him in up w. This has been confirmed by the ^iadhi al araahi, who says there{ | there will be no forward movement in our i rotectorate so |lon^s as the Idrisi refrains from advancing near Hodeidah. 1 have also told the Sheikii that when the «eidi troops withdraw from places in Kadfan, he and hie tribesmen and j ' the confederated tribes must not interfere with them in • any way* but must allow them to depart in peace* It appears from a complaint just received from a Hodeidah merchant named i ohamed Ahmed Kunfinani that his dhow *Alawi* which went aground and which had on board goods valued at Rs*16*000* was looted by the Jubehis at Rascal-Arab in our Protectorate* in dune last.

Ac ting Pol itical Re si dent,| 8th ADEN NEWS LETTER. -SESRET. [ + (The contents of this letter are for the sole information of those to whoa it is sent. Not to be reproduced). The following is a suBnary of the news reported since the despatch of ray last letter dated 3rd August 1922. ASIR. The Political Officer, Hodeide., reports the ( death of the Idrisi's youngest son, which octcurrsd in the last week of July. The Political Officer, Hodeida, also reports a rising of the BmI Kughaid tribe under the leadership of Hasm ibn Aidh and his cousin Abdur Rahman against the garrison of Ibn Saud in Abha, numbering 60 men. These mn who were besieged in a fortress are said to have been released through the intervention of the Idrisi »nd allowed to return to Shah ran. T1HAMA The Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that in July last, a section of, 'he 3araniqs under Ahmed Fitini who are unfriendly to the Idrisi, made two raids on the Idrisi Camps at Ka* Bania near iansuria and at Mandar near Hodeida, The Zaraniqs were driven away with the loss of 6 men. The Idrisi's casualties were three soldiers killed and one wounded. Tn« Msnakha agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that Saiyid Ahmad and Shaikh Abdullah Haseawa, nephew and father-in-law, respectivelj of ADEN RESIDE ICY, 5th September, 1922.Of Saiyid Abdul Kadir, tha Man safe of Marram, have gone to Sana bearing a letter fro® the Man sab to the Imam. They give out that they are intermediaries in a domestic dispute between an Arab trader of Hodeida, Mohammad Sulaiman All and another merchant in Bllad Anis. The agent says that they received a great reception at Menakha. It is possible that this mission may have some connection with the old time pretension of Sayed Abdul Kader to the leadership of a Shafei bloc in the Tih&amp;iaa. The same agent reports that Kinan Bey who wished to go to Constantinople has been refused mission by Imam. Sen tt he could not get the permission Kinan Bey made an attempt to escape to Aden, but was stopped on the way srd is said to be now confined in a fort. The Political Officer, Hodaida, reports that fighting continues on the Reinna-Bura borders, the immediate objective of the Imaaic force being the village of Junmam. On the other fronts tha situation is quiet. Captain Fazluddin has submitted a statement showing the Uriel 1 &amp; average monthly revenue and expenditure in Hodeida during the current year, from . which it appears that the monthly deficit is about Rs.17,000. The figures are as follows:- Revenue Rs.66,800 Expenditure Fs. 73,800 I had Called for this statement in order to verify the Idrisi*s statement regarding expenditure inin hi8 rgply to Captain F&amp;zluddin, referred to in th© Xiw« Latter d^ted 30th June 1322. Captain F&amp;zluddin informs me that 18 old ©tab) ishad traders of Hod©ida have closed their business houses since the occupation of the place by the Uriel. Captain Fatluddln also informs me that the j house tax in Hodeida has recently been increased by 200^ and that it now amounts to four times the tax j which the Turks levied before the War; that the number i of taxable houses has also been'considerably increased j by taxing in addition house compounds as distinct from | the house. The lurisi also resorts to the experiment of collecting customs duty in advance on good© which he states the traders till receive srortly. In his anxiety to 1notease revenue, the Idrisi seems to be killing the goose rhioh lays thgolden egg. The Command*;r of H»X.8» Cornflower informs me that he called at Mocha in July last and on inquiry from the Sheikh there found that no French ship had cal lad there for a long time and that no Italian ship had visited Mocha since the far. Th© Zabeed agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that Ibn ©1 Wazir has written to th© three prominent merchants of Zabeed, Mahomed H&amp;ss&amp;n Jum&amp;^ni, Shaikh Ibrahim Mizjaji and Mohammad Ibrahim Biluh asking them to com© to D&amp;mar. Th© merchant® are said to be vary nervous as they do not know the reason for this unexpect d summons. Th® Assistant Resident, Peri®, reports that the Frenchmen referred in in my last letter (p&lt;tg. 5) 1 are preparing to return to Mocha, in8tead('of Constanti- Inople. MahomedMahomed Ze id Awad 4 tha Sheikh of Mash alaha near Mocha took refuge in Perim last month through fear of an Imamic force vhich recently arrived at Mocha. Sheikh % 7eid the Assistant Resident, Perim, and told him that the Frenchmen referred to above took ith them the Imam f s *wakil to Jibouti. The Sheikh believed that the French were trying to acquire the port of Mocha# This statement lacks confirmation* The report that Sheikh Ali Othman and his brother tore taken prisoners by the Imam has proved groundless* Sheikh Ali Othman with his brother, son and 23 followers visited Aden last month with the ostensible object of having his son treated by one of our doctors* He left for Mocha on the 28th August* His real object must have been to reiterate his request for assistance, as reported in my last ; considered it advisable not to have anything, to do I with him and before he could ask for an'interview f I mnaged to give him to understand that it would not ba qr^-ted, it' .iskei# ADEN PROTECTORATE. The Haushabi Chief, Sultan Ali Manih died on the 23rd August and his son Mohsin ibn Ali Manih has ^ been elected rnbr of the Haushabis in succession to his late father* The election, however, is not unanimous. There is another claimant to the Sultanate in the person of Ali ba Sallam of Ahl F&amp;jj&amp;r. who has no re J following but has been encouraged in his pretensions by the absence of the Amo or and A1 Ghaii clans from the election. The absence was in reality a sign of neutrality end was not intended to show a preference for any particular candidate. TheI Tiie Abdal i Sultan proposes to ratify the election in accordance with the terms of the Abdali-Haushabi treaty of 1895. One of the terms of the treaty is that the Haushabi Sultan should collect his transit dues at Lahej. Ali ba Sallam the pretender has expressed his intention of disregarding this stipulation and has commenced to axact illegal dues from caravans at any point he considers fit* At the request of young Sultan Mohsin the Abdali Sultan has agreed to garrison Musemir, the Haushabi capital, with 300 men under his brother Sultan Ahmed Fadl, until such time as all the clans have shown their acquiescence in the new regime. The troops are also to render assistance in keeping clear the trade rout© passing through Musemir* I have expressed ray concurrence in all these measures, as it is extremely desirable that the Zaidis should not be given any cause for complaint that the country bordering on their post ci£ Maviya is in an unsettled state and that armed intervention is necessary. Sheikh Mahomed Ahmed Noman referred to in my last letter (page 8) is reported to have arrived with some Zeidi and Shafai soldiers at A1 Ghurib and Kabil As Sabt in the Wadi Maadin within^the Subehi border. Sheikh Mahomed Ahmed Noman himself has taken up his quarters in the house of the Mansab of the Sanawi. They are said to be exacting taxes from the people of Wadi Shaab and Wadi Maadin. Sheikh Noman recently wrote to the Abdali Sultan complaining against certain Subehi akils for harbouring fugitives from the other side of the border. The Abdali Sultan has warned the Subehis against such a practice. Sheikh Noman is reported to have written to Taiz and other places asking for more men. His intention is statedI I 9 stated to to oo 1 laot as big a fores as possible and to attack the Subehls* This report is not confirmed*. The Ssidi strength in the Asiri country and Had fan is reported to be 88? men variously distributed. The Alawi Sheikh reports that about 4000 ?eidis have arrived at Bamar under the command of Saif ul Islam and Saiyid Yahya and that they will proceed against Yafa and Bad fan. About the middle of last month, arrivals from Bhala reported that bakris and Hu jail is in the Rad fan had been ordered to supply camels for carrying the baggage of reinforcements of 800 men coming from Madira to Bhala* The camels were said to have been gathered at Tafwa and R&amp;dfan* An aeroplane, reconnaissance which was recently made over these places showed no concentration of either men or camels at the p.Laces mentioned* Sheikh Mokbil Abdulla, the nephew of the Kotebi Sheikh and Amir Abdul Hamid are reported to have been summoned by the Imam to Sana. The Kotehi Sheikh is said to have received a warning from a 7eidi friend to be on the look out. It is not clear whether this warning refers to any fresh advance against the R&amp;dfan or any treachery C-nnst the Sheikh. The feidis who are still in the Bakri country are said to have demanded tithes from the Kotebis, who h&amp;w lands in the neighbourhood. The latter have d ; :u ined to pay t em. Owing to the increasing Subehi lawlessness on trade routes and in the Abduli territory, the Abdali Sultan•J I Sultan engaged mercenaries to deal with the marauders. One of the conditions of agement is said to be that they should retain any booty they take belonging to the marauders* These Aulaki mercenaries are reported to have attacked one of the marauding Sections of the Subehi and captured some camels and sheep and sold them in Lakej• The Aulakis lost two men in the fighting. A report says that the Imam*s envoy Cadi al Arashi has already left Sana for Aden, but I can get no confirmation. In the meantime the Imm has not replied to General Scott’s letter, sent by the hand of al Arashi, containing draft terms for a proposed treaty ^ith him, nor has he replied to two references I have made to him* Rumours of concentration against the Aden Protectorate are reviving. MISCELLANEOUS. Mr. Amin Rihani left Aden for Bombay en route for Basrah on the 15th August by the Lloyd Triestino c . $• 'Irnushbruck’ 5 . Ho had not received Ibn laud’s reply to his request for permission to visit Nojd but expected to receive it at Bahrein. He stated that even in th i case of a favourable reply fro® Ibn Saudi he &gt;*ould go first to Baghdad. (SB.) C. BAPRETT.

Not to be The Allowing is a eanmary of the news reported since the despatch of the last letter dated 30th June «J» Captain r’azluftdin reports that at the beginning Oi hay last, ibn baud's forces in Asir coim;itt©d groat atrocities in the Ghamid and Zahrm country where they killed 3000 men of the uhamid trib®. This is caid to be in retaliation for the help whici* this tribe gave to the ohahran tribe in the latter'a attack against the .fehabis in Larch last. The ohahran tribe had. then killed. 1500 v/ahabis, but Ibn Gaud la said at that time to hare blamed his own Aiail for the revolt which he considered was due to tiie Aiuil ® tyrannous rule. The present action of the .aliaoie is therefore considered to have been taken witiiout the knowledge of the Ibn 3aud. The Shahrans are said to be holding out successfully against the .Vahabjs. Captain Fazluddin states tliat these two tribes, Ghamid and Aahrana and Bani dhahran as also the tribe of Bani Shehr have not placed themselves under the suzerainty of the Idrisi or any other ruler as the opinion in their countxy is divided between the Idrisi and the King; of the Hedjas. A Baudic force consisting of about 30GG Wahabi fanatics and tribal desperadoes is said to have reached as far as the Bui Qarnel country having arrived at a villagevillage only one day* a journey to the east of Kunfida. Captain Fazluddin reports intar-tribal strife between the tribes of Rijal-el-;* and Beni Hughaid owin^ to the murder of 2 man of Beni Mugjmid by the former. As the Beni iughaid are under the influence of it® Saud's Govaraaent of the latter hare asked the Idrisi for the surrender of the murderers, ■the Idrisi is said not to have cotsplied with the demand but to have suggested the convening of a mixed court. »*e tiso sent the ,ad.i of Jisan to Ghabain in Bijal-el-ha to watch the proceedings. Captain •'azluddin writes that while he was in Jizan in June last, a deputation waited on the Idrisi with a letter from Hasan ibn Aidh in which the latter described his pitiable plight since the occupation of jioha by Ibn baud. Captain .Fazluddin says that the idrisi showed great sympathy .tin' has granted him a monthly stipend of 200 dollars. He has also eent him sum of 500 dollare. TIRAM. It is reported that a reinforcement of 2 C 0 Q Zaidi Regulars with guns and ammunition, which arrived at Uenakha at the beginning of July, will proceed against Bura'i. A report from Tarawa states that Saiyid Abdul iisdir 31 -Ahdal, the J’aneab of Mamma received a letter from ..iahmud Nadhim on tiie 6th instant, in which the latterlatter states that Ghasi huatafa Kamal Pasha has strong^ | UrK0d hira aa m11 as aU the wall wishers of Islam and lurkey in tne Ym*n to spare no effort to bring about a peace between Imam Yahya and the Idriai, and requests the - ansab to do his utmost to achieve this result. Captain Pazluddin reports that he had a long conversation with an important Saiyid of Marrawa, Abdur Rahman Sl-Ahdal, who came to see him in Hodeida, on current events and the prospects of a settlement between the Imam and the Idrisi. Captain 1azluddin says that he asked the Saiyid why the Mansabe of the Yemen did not try to bring about that settlement. The Saiyid replied that they were trying, and were always ready to do what may be required i|Oi them, but that in this matter they looked to the ^British to find a solution. The truth was that in the — j. ihama, if a plcbescite were taken, not a single soul would be found in favour of having the Zeidis as his ruiero, and that tilings had become so complicated that Peace was only possible now on the basis of both the Irram and the Idrisi retaining what they were holding at preBent* The Saiyid bold Captain F&amp;zluddin that the Imam had been much upset by the Idriai's success in getting Zaraniq hostages and that he (Saiyid) had been approached by Saiyid kohaarnad Ssh-Shaai, the Imamic Amil of Sa'fan on behalf of the Imam for an explanation as to how the araniqs were induced to consent to give hostages to the Idrisi. The Saiyid said ha had explained to Saiyid Sheasi that it was impossible for any Government to take hostages from the Zaraniqs forcibly; that the Zaraniqs,2arard(i*» # with tm negligible exception of Ahmed r'itini ana his el;ui f profesaed themtol^ee unreservedly for* the Acrif4 # hut uuit he m* too cautious to take them at their wor ^ or ^ :r y ^ occupy their country until ho had sufficient money to satisfy their avarice* Captain F&amp;sduddin writes that the Idrisi Govemnent !m» started building a fort on the south of the town of BodeIda* 1 * 9 3.

Gur news correspondent at Jebel Jihaf under date 6 th July reports that -aiyid Yahyo., commanding at Dhala and Saiyid Kahotnad Shatai, the Anil, have left Dhala, tet tho toil, A1 Ansi, who was in Jalila, has left for i.ataba, leaving iiadi Husain to act for him. He states that a large number of the soldier's and the araif’ araif having deserted, Qadi Husain reported this fact to Saiyid Yahya, who has now sent 1G0 soldiers as a reinforcement for our Protectorate area. Before the arrival of this reinforcement, the strength of the combined garrison of Uhala district is stated to have been 265 men. Although the Zeidis have withdrawn from the Radfan country, they still maintain a post at Dahirat el bakri and Suleik. The presence of this post is tn cause of hardship to tribes who fear to return to their houses or cultivate their fields. General Scott in his last letter to the Imam dated 6 th July 1922 referred to this case and has asked hia,. uo withdraw the post. General Scott has also asked him in the same letter to withdraw his men from Jadi Shaab within the Subehi country where Sheikh l.ahoma Ahmed Noman and his men have been causing trouble. An encounter is reported between the Fadli and Lower Yafa^ in consequence of their old feud over the waters of the Ba,na river. A band of Makhdumis (Subehis) under one MohoraBc Abdul Tumba who was in our service at Nobat Dakim and was imprisoned at Lahej for stealing some stores, has started harassing the Abdali dultan by petty raids in his territory. The Sultan is taking steps to deal with the band. One of them, who had lately committed several thefts has been killed by the ansuris. The Haushabi Sultan also has had some trouble with the basusi section of the bubehis who are his neighbours and who had recently started raiding on the road.r ° ad * ‘ lirie wr ^«® that he has punished theta by executing 4 of them. Ibn al .azir, the 1 bmb*« at ' aiz i 8 reported to nave written to the rakhdumi sheikh that tha latter'e tribesmen have looted a convoy of the Yemen people and that unless the looted goods are returned at once, he (the Amil) win mow md attack hira with a large iorce, 1 have received no coni irsiation of^this report* :n 3 Seda Sultan in the Aden Protectorate is reported io be fighting with his recalcitrant tritewnen who have refused to pay him taxes. /,aidi intrigues in the Seda Sultanate still continue. j.&amp; i Crw un: i-Xj uu# r. Amin Rihani returned to Aden last month iraa oizan. Ho intends leavin,; for Iraq shortly. Captain Kazluddin writes that during his stay in Jizan i r. Hihani had several intejrviews with the Idrisi and discussed with him a draft agreement which he proposed that the Idrisi and the Kin,; of the iiedjaz should sign. Captain Kazluddin says that the Idrisi has approved of the draft agreement with a few changes. Copies of 'Captain ifazluddin's report on the subject and oi the draft agreement have been sent to you under cover of my letter No. 112 dated 20th July 1922. At his request I gave Mr. Amin Hihani two interviews. It appears that h» saw the Imam on several occasions in anaa and professes to be conveying Imam’s sentiments though he states that he is not acting on behalfilll 1 o-Bhalf of the Imam but on behalf of a peraon who has the sar of Imam. This person is hayed Ahmed bin Yahia al Kiboi, a noted intr^er »ho had visitod Aden in 1918 ana who now appears to be trying to usurp the Qadhi Aodulia al Arashi's place as the Imam's representative in Aden* ihe sot total of r. Amin Hihani's message is that the imam is extremely powerful and may an attack on Aden, but that he is quite willing to cm* to terms with us and concede all we want in the Protectorate provided we help him to get Hodaidah from the idrisi. In return for hodeidah the Imam would be willing to acknowledge the Idrisi's rule' over portions of Asir and f ® V0n over Abha which the imam claims at present. (It is actually in the possession of din baud). Mr. Amin lUhani sujgested an amistice and a conference between hayed Mustafa and some representative of the imam. I thanked r. min Rihani for his message and assured him that H.B. . Uovernraent would be only too pleased to find a way to reconcile the differences between trie Imam and the Idrisi, but that we could not be expected to tale active steps against tiie Idrisi. our ally in the war who is already bound to us by a treaty the contents of |which we have coninunicated to the Imam. t i urther told him that so long as the Qadhi Abdulla al Arashi was the Imam’ a accredited representative.

Two of tile members of the Idrisi Tax collecting mission have gone with tho accounts to Bahia to discuss them with the Idrisi. I have now received a copy of tho Idrisi'a reply to Captain 'axluddin, referred to in ry last letter. In this tho Idrisi endeavours to justify his taxation on tho ground of tho heavy expenditure in curred by him for the defence of Hodeida.

I have the honour to forward, for your information, 3 copies of the 5th Aden News Letter dated the 30th May 1922. I have etc., (Sgd) T.S.Scott, Major-General, Political Resident, Aden.sm. 5th Aden News Letter SECRET. (Contents of this letter are for the sole information of those to whom it is sent. Not to be reproduced). The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 1st May, 1922. ASIR . Captain M. Fazluddin, Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that at the end of March 1922 the Beni Shihir tribe revolted against the Qadhi of Bin Saud and killed about 800 men of the Wahabi force. On hearing of the rising the King of the Hedjaz deputed one of his officials to the Beni Shihir country to act as Amil there but the tribesmen having declined to accept him, the King recalled his man to Mecca. Captain Fazluddin says that subsequently the Beni Shihir tribesmen sent their representatives to the Idrisi at Sabia on the 16th April 1922 asking for his help against Bin Saud, but the Idrisi while holding out no promise of assistance told them that he would try to settle their differences with Bin Saud. The rising is reported to be due to the ex tremely fanatical rule of the Qadhi in the Beni Shihir country and Bin Saud is said to have blamed him for the trouble. The Zaranil Sheikhs, who were imprisoned, as reported in my last letter, by Sheikh Mahomed Tahir Ridwan, the Idrisi Commander at Bajil, for refusal to gi ve hostages until the Idrisi tro ops had occupied \ Voccupied their country, are reported to have been released on their complying with the Idrisi's demand. It is said that these Sheikhs are now intending to hold a meeting of their tribesmen for the purpose of considering the question of the occupa tion of the town of Beit-ol-Pakih by the Idrisi, who has already kept in readiness the required number of troops .1 or the purpose and is awaiting the decision of the Sheikhs. The Political Ofiicer, Hodeida, reports that 1 th ® tw0 ?rench ™n and interpreter, mentioned in my last i letter, have arrived at Sanaa and that the 12 boxes of s presents they carried contained telephone material for the Imam. in informant states that Imam has granted a concession to the French to construct a railway line j fr ° m Mocha to Sanaa &gt; and ^t the French have agreed j to supply the Imam with 3000 rifles and ammunition ior tile purpose of capturing and holding Sheikh Saeed. This report has, however, not been confirmed. Tuere is a strong rumour, which also still lacss confirmation, that a party of thirty-six Frencnmen and Turks have landed at Dubab and have gone to Sanaa. The late Turkish Chief of Police in the Yemen named Hilmi Bey is said to be one of the party. Captain Fazluddin writes that the Idrisi sent a Commission to Ilodeida on the 3rd May 1922 consisting of his cousin, Syed Maljomed el Arabi, the younger brotner of Saiyid Mustafa, Sheikh Mahomed Yehia Basahi, a prominent merchant of Jizan, and one hemal Effendi, a clerk, to collect zakats for the current year and to re-organize the administration of the town. The amount of zakats demanded by the idrisi* / ' f\^ is saia to be 100,000 dollars which the people and merchants of Hodeida have objected to paying. In view of the fact that the heavy taxation imposed by the I drisi at Hodeida last year, as reported in my news letter dated 30th June, 1921, has already alienated the trading community to a large degree, Captain Fazluddin, under my instructions, addressed a friendly protest to the Idrisi pointing out to him tnat aroitrary impositions of this nature cannot fail to be prejudicial to his claims to the permanent ownership of the town. Also that while he (the Idrisi) has an undisputed right to settle the system of taxation in his own territory, we feel bound to warn him of the danger of adopting unpopular measures in the territory, the permanent sovereignty of which is still undecided, as its final allocation must be affected to a great extent by the wishes of the inhabitants. Captain Fazluddin telegraphed to me on the 18th May 1922 stating that the Idrisi had sent him a reply, which, although not altogether satisfactory, is on the whole an acceptance of my advice. I am expecting to receive full details by post. Mahmud Nadhim, ex-1all of Yemen, has sent a reply to Major Reilly's letter, referred to in my news letter dated 28th February 1922. While thanking him for our offer to receive him at Aden with all the consideration due to his rank and position and to meet the expenses of his repatriation to Constantinople, Mahmud Nadhim states that he is unable to leave the Yemen, owing to the orders of Mustafa Kemal, who has directed him to remain there until terms of peace have been concluded between the British and Turkish Governments.G-overnments. He has, however, expressed his desire to send his family to Constantinople and has asked whether arrangements could be made at Aden for their early des patch . A reply has been sent to him expressing a hope that the terms of peace will soon be concluded between the two Governments, and asking him to send in a list giving the number and names of his family whom he desires to send to Constantinople, to enable this Residency to obtain the previous permission of His Excellency the High Commissioner, Constantinople . XEMEH (Upper and Lower) Fighting is reported among the Zaidis in the Jebel Habesh district outside our Protectorate, It is said that the cause of this is that Ibn el Wazir, the Imamic Commander, sent orders to Sheikh Hooruddin bin Hassan of Jebel Habesh directing him to despatch his soldiers to Dala. The latter accordingly issued orders to his men but they refused to comply with them for fear of British aeroplanes. Thereupon Sheikh Hooruddin collected Saidi soldiers and attacked the men who dis obeyed him. In the fighting that ensued Wooruddin him self was killed and there were several casualties on both sides. The Zaidis are said to have received re inforcements from Ibb, Taiz and Mavia and fighting con tinues. Sheikh Nooruddin was the brother of Sheikh Mahomed Hassan of Jebel Habesh, who betrayed Jebel Maktari to the Zaidis as reported in my news letter dated 28th September 1921. ADEN PROTECTORATE In response to my telegraphic message, referred toto in my last letter, the Imam ordered his Commander, baiyia Yehia bin Mahomed, to withdraw from the Radfan country, and the latter accordingly returned to Bala on the 6 th May 1922 with all his force leaving behind only a picket of about 30 men at Urkub in the Bakri country. Since then fighting between the Zaidis and the Radfan oiices has practically ceased. But reports continue to come Saiyid Yehia is concentrating troops at Bala and that Ibn el Wazir, the Imamic Commander, has arrived at Bala from Mavia with a Zaidi force. It is rumoured that the Imam has sent telegraphic orders to Ibn el Wazir to send Abdul Hamid, brother of the Amir of Bala, and Mukbil Abdulla, nephew of the Koteibi Sheikh, again to the Radfan country to induce the tribesmen to tender their submission to the Zaidis. If* the tribesmen decline to listen to them, it is stated that Saiyid Yehia end Ibn el Wazii will again advance against the Radfan country after tne Ramazan Id. The Amir of Bala reports that the Zaidis are sending letters to the heads of the Radfan tribesmen calling upon them to tender their submission to the Imam, I have addressed letters to the Amir of Bala, the Koteibi Sheikh, and the principal Sheikhs of the Radfan country warning them against any interference with the Zaidis as long as the latter remain within their original limits and do not attack them. No hostilities are at present going on in any part of the Protectorate. MISCELLANEOUS Mr. Amin Rehani and his companion Constantine Yanni arrived at Sanaa and they informed the United states Consul at Aden that they had a very good reception from the Imam. Captainmmmm Captain x H 'azluddin has since telegraphed to me that Mr. Ami.u Rehani and his companion arrived at Hodeida from Sanaa on the ^2nd May 1922 and that they intend to go to see the Idrisi in a few days. Captain Fazluddin states tnat Mr. Amin Rehani is strongly biassed towards the Imam and ohat he ana his companion desire to discuss political questions with me in Aden. .) T* S. SCOTT. Mag .G-en.

The B&amp;jil news agent .reports that the Laranik Mfieiks, who were considering the question of the occupation of their country by tie lirisi, as reporteo in my last letter, ha?e been imprisoned by bheikh raliomed Tahir itidwan, the Idrisi Ooroander at bajil. The case of the imprisonment is said tP he the refusal of the bheikhs to give hostages to Sheikh 'mhom&amp; Tahir until the Idrisi troops had occupied tneir country. It is reported that great insecurity is prevailing in the town of beii~el*Fakih and that the inhabitants are therefor© very anxious to invite the Idrisi to occupy tiie town for the purpose of restoring order and establishing a stable Govermient, The mene^ia news agent reports that the whale force of tiie Kamdan tribe stationed at bafan arrived at Menakha on the ITtfi far on 1922 and. after halting there for day left han&amp;a. It is said that they have been recalled by the Imam as they are on indifferent terns with the toil of bafan, who has also been ordered by the Imam to cciae to hark.-'.

The mme news agent also reports that at the r©Quest of the Ami 1 of Jebel MsIhan the Imam has sent to him 200 soldiers from Sanaa belonging to the tribes of Beni Matar and Beni Barash. Tt is reported, that 8 guns and 2 machine guns have been sent from Sanaa to Bauda, where large forces are being collected for the purpose of mar hing against the Arhab country whose inhabitants are said to have revolted against the Imam. The Arhab tribe numbering about 5000 fighting men are stated to be awaiting the Imamic attack in their strongholds. Sheikh Ali Othman, Mil of Mckha, is reported to have revolted against the Imam and to have declared his independence, but this news still needs confirmation. The Zabeed news agent reports that on the 25th February last Hasson Mahomed FashiQ, Theikh ofvta 9 _ ^ the Southern Zarani^ country, with 30 of his followers oi whom majority were A^ils, visited Sheikljsduhsaied Tahir Bidwan, the Tdrisi Commander at Bajil, and asked him to senu his troops to occupy the whole of the ZaraniQ. country, -her-f, d.ere being no proper government, murders and raids were being committed daily. Sheikh Muhamed Tahir in. response to this request held a meeting of the principal Sheikhs of the Aboos, Oahra and ether Zaraniq tribes end af tir discussing the matter with them proposed that each of these tribes should supply 300 men while he himself ^ould send 400 soldiers to occupy the ZaraniQ. country. But Sheikh Yahiya Ali Mazria of the ^uhra tribe on hearing of the proposal, volunteered to supply alone 1000 men for the puiposs on conditicn tha t all the 7 aranik Sheikhs g^Vc hostages in the hands of Sheikh Muhamed Tahir. The Zaranik Sheikhs are said to be consid ring the matter and their final decision is awaited. Ti is reported that the Hashid, a large and power ful tribe to the North of Sanaa, whose Chief, Sheikh Naaer Mabkhut died a short time ago, has revolted against the Imam and occupied As Suda, Captain M. Fazluddin T.M.S., Political Officer, RodeIda, who is at present in Aden, reports that a Frenchman disguised as an Arab arrived at Rode.Ida on the 12th instant from Khckha by a, dhow. He at first, stated that his name was Adined Rassan. But on being questioned further he admitted that he was a Frenchman, and have the following account of himself to the Governor of Hodeida He said that his name ms Monsieur Victor Cherivcux and that he had joined the American Navy as an officer in 1917, but resigned in 1918 and joined the AmericanAmerican Air Force. He subsequently entered the French Secret Service in America. He afterwards returned to France and obtained a 'passport to go to Mombasa for trade. He however went to Jibouti instead and remained there from March IPSO to January 1922 ^tien he proceeded to Sanaa via Mocha. He remained at Sanaa for about 20 days and during this period had several interviews with the Imam, his ministers and Mahmud Nadhim, ex-Vali of Yemen. He left Sanaa on the 20 th February last for HodeIda where he arrived via Mokha on the 12th instant. He holds the following certificate signed by the Imam and dated 15th Jumad Akhar 1340 (12th February 1922) M This is to certify that our friend Monsieur Victor Cherivoux surnamed Hasan Aomod, arrived at our Imam?:, te in Sanaa and was entertained at our guest house during his stay there with ell the honour due to him. understand that he holds high Proficiency in Analytic and in Synthetic Chemistry and is desirous of serv : ng under us. fe shall gladly give him a post on his return from his country with his family, a few cheap appliances he needs, and a letter from his Government”. This Frenchman is reported to express anti- British and anti-Idrisi sentiments. He wishes to proceed to Jeddah, but the Tdrisian authorities detained him pending the return of Captain Fazluddin from Aden to Hodeida. The Frenchman is much annoyed at his detention and has written to the British Military Administrator at Kamaran asking him to facilitate his onward journey. T have wired to the Idrisi through the Military Administrator, Krrrran, -advising him to allow him to proceed. ATTNADEN PROTECTORATE. Mohamad toed Nom&amp;n, The Shafai Bheikh in the Imamic employ, remained in the Wadi Maadin in the Subehi country, after the Zaidi evacuation of Am Farsha and the Adhali Sultan reports that majority of local Subehis tendered their submission to him. He is nm stated to have left the Subehi country, leaving only a few small pickets behind and taking Subehi hostages with him. Fighting continues in the Radf&amp;n country *?here the tribesmen have had successes at H&amp;qla and other places, and have recovered most of Jebel Wadena, th- important hill in the Ahl Abdulla country. T n spite of the Zaidi reinforcements sent to the Radfan country, a considerable number of Zaldis is said to be deserting partly owing to their fear of aeroplanes and partly because many of them belong to the large and powerful Hashid tribe, sfoich, as stated earlier in this letter, has revolted against the Imam. On hearing that the Zaidis -ere deserting, Bayed Y&amp;hia, the Tmarric Commander at Bala, set out for Buleik with the object of encourag ing the Zaidis and stepping desertions but he gave up his Journey before reaching Buleik and returned to Dala. The Zaidis in tills district appear to be discouraged and reports continue to come in of an intended with drawal. Abdul tkmid, brother of the Amir of Dala, and Mukbil Abdulla, nephew of the Kcteibi ^eikh, who are both under the influence of the Zaidis, to whom they have given hostages, have been trying to arrange peace between the Amir of n&amp;ia end the Zaidis. T have informed the Amir that I shall be glad if peace can be made onterms that are satisfactory and honourable but on condition that the Zaidis leave the B&amp;df&amp;n country* Tbn el Wazir, the Tmamic Com&amp;n&amp;ev , is *still at Mavia and is said to be collecting troops, but so far he has mde no movement in any direction, although it is rumoured that he intends to advance against the Haushabi country. The Haushabi Sultan has asked for' assistance itiich T have replied would be forthcoming if he is actually attacked. Tt is reported that Zaldls have re-occupied 9 Suwadia on the borders of the Beds country and that they contemplate making another advance against the Beda Sultan. Bat so far T have received no communica tion from the Sultan confirming this report. (Sgd) I.Scott, Major General ! To.

SCOTT, Major-General, Political Resident, Aden. r i\ iBt Aiji^K Ni^WS LETTER Aden Heslden^y 31st January 1923. The following Is a summary of the news reported el nee the despatch of my last letter dated 31st December 1931. Officer, Hodel&amp;a, writes that two messengers have arrived at -Ti^an with letters from ibn Saud to the Idrlsl, who Is at present at Midi but expected shortly to go to Jizan to meet the messengers. during the past year to Jizan with letters and presents from Ibn Saud to the Idrlsl. The letters contain nothing of importance beyond the usual expression of a most friendly attitude towards the Idrisi. that there is no offensive alliance between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud, but it appears that a mutual understanding exists between them according to which, if Ibn Saud ever Invades Hed.i&amp;s, the Idrisi should observe strict neutrality. The Political Officer states that the Idrisi fears the fanaticism of the Wahables, and is therefore always anxious to prevent their movements in the direction of Tehama - more especially towards the portion of the ASIB. Captain M.Pasluddin, I.M.S,, Political Such messengers have come frequently The Political Officer, Hodeida, reports countrycountry he o^uples. Siru&gt;e the oPupation of I3bha hy I bn Baud in 1930, the ilriei hae not obRented to him ojollebting 2 aKat from nearly the whole of Asir while he himself oontente himself with the revenues oi a small strip of land in that country extending from Jiaan to Shabain and BirK. Saiyid Mohammed bin Alawi ©1 Saqqof, the representative of the King or the Hedjass* referred to in my latter, dated 1st November last returned iram Sanaa on the 6th instant accompanied by Salyld Mohamad bin Mohammed Sahara. The latter is the envoy or the Imam of Sanaa to the King of the deltas. iioth 1@rt Aden for Jeddah on 33rd January. During the course of an interview. Saiyid Mohammed bin Alawi el mqqor stated that the object ox hi© mission to Sanaa was to negotiate peace between the Imam and the Idrisi . Prior to hie departure to Sanaa he had discussed the subject »/itn s&amp;iyid Mustafa el Xdrisl at Jisan and he had now done so with the Imam, who assured him of hls , full reliance on the King of the Hed^ae ana deputed Salyld Mohammed bln Mohammed Zahara as his envoy to discuss matters with King Kuaeln. Fte hoped that the Ii.iaia and the Idrlol might come to terms nut this can. ha said, oe achieved only through the help of the British Government and the King of the Hedjae, who should advise ftoth the parties to amk their differences and persuade them of the advantages they would gain from mutual friendship, with this object in view he aeKed for a letter from me to the King of the Kedjaz as he thought it would greatly •ncourage1000 entourage the King to navvy on the worK undertaKen oy Hi© Majesty to bring about mutual friendship between the two rulers. I have aooordingly given nhn a letter in general term© after nonsuiting the British Agent at Jeddah, to whom a copy of it ha© been Bent for his information. Referring to our negotiations for the | P^posed treaty with the Imam, Saiyid Mohammed | Aiawi ei SaoQOf said that the imam's Intentions toward© the British Government were very friendly. If but the ^Ise reports that reach him from different 1 1 source© about the alleged return of TurXs to the Yemen make him feel doubtful as to his future | po8itl &gt;n * rn spite of this fact Saiyid Mohammed i Alawi thought that an understanding between the ; British aoverruent and the Imam would be arrived at. TXdAMA . The Menekha news agent reports that the Xmamio troops under the command of sheikh All i bn-el-Mikdad and dsbashi Yahiys er—Radarni a ttanked tr&lt;e ion si forces on the borders of Jebel jjura. but were repulsed and the Idrisi forces succeeded in re-occupying the village of Jummurn. ?he Imamic troops are said to have retired to iJslat-el-Haqba. It is reported that the Imaiaic Amii at Menekha proceeded on the 13th December 1931 to dairae uakhlia, the base of operations in Jebel Heima, and sumraoned all the Sheikh© of the ©unrounding villages. He ordered them to raise a force of1000 men within 15 days time to reinforce the Irnamio troops engaged in fighting against the Idrisi. one Kazi M -AKuh is said to have been appointed to enlist the men end to distribute them on the various fronts in label Heima. The imam has reinforced his garrisons at Safaan, Madwal, and Tarsi* with 500 men from the Arhabs tribe (a sub-tribe of the Rashid), 30 mule loads of ammunition and 17 camel loads of flour. The Idrisi Amil at Saidiya reports that the Imam has sent a force of 1000 men from the districts of Tawila and Mahwit to label Maiham, where severe fighting is proceeding between the Imam and the Idrisi, The Idrisi troops were beeeiged in Hubat and Ma 'mla and the Imamic Commander, Saiyid Mohammed bin Abdulla el Manassar, was trying to cut off their communication with Zaidiya. Sheikh Mohammed Tahir, the Idrisi commander, with his assistant Had! Ralj arrived on the scene with b large reinforcement and after 0 severe fight succeeded in raising the siege. The mils are said to have lost la men and the idrisi about 10 men killed. The Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that lawlessness still prevails in the town of Beit-el- Faklh in spit® 01 the settlement arrived s.t between the inhabitants as reported in my letter dated 30th November 1931. According to the Zabeed news agent, one of the inhabitants recently killed a neighbour and absconded to the Salifi village• Bayed Sufee, the Manseb of the town, on receiving thethe report of th© ineiient, ordered the SheiKh of the Salifl village to surrender the murderer, hut he refused. Thereupon the Maneah no1leeted ail the inhabitants of the other villages of th© town and attanked the Salifi village. Five men were Killed in the fight am disturbances are said to be continuing. The Zahaed news agent reports that Kase&amp;n Mohamad Yehiya, the ZaranlK ShalKh, has arrested the man, referred to in my last letter, who had Killed a man of the Karashia tribe in the Suq of Kussainlye. ffe states that the liiurdererdoes not belong to the ZaraniK tribe and that he will be handed over to the Kara©hia ShelKh, whan demanded, for trial. Captain Fa 2 lurid in writes that Salyid Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Kaselm, a relative of the* imam of Sanaa and formerly Anil of Jebel Buraa, proceeded to mmm on pilgrimage in September last and on his return journey came to Jizan with a letter frc^i th© King of the Hed^as to the Idrlsi. When Jebel liuraa was in the Imam's occupation this Saiyid had taken hostages from the principal Sheikhs of that place and sent them to Sanaa, where they are still imprisoned. ?he i&amp;riei has therefore, at the request of the Sheikhs of j©bel Burma, detained the Saiyid at Jlzan pending the return oy the Imam of the hostages taken from them. Captain Fazluddlin states that Salyid Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Kassim told the idrisl that h© had written to the Imam suggesting that a c om © re no© oi linami c and Idrisl representatives shouldshould be held at gttjjftUft « view to settling the.tr Hire rentes, .and asked the idriei to give na i:e * oi ' agents tor eomunlcation to the I-tain. The Idrisl thanked the Saiyid for hie laudable efforts and told him that on hearing that the Imam had appointed Mb representatives he would give the names of his agents. Captain Fazludciln, who wan asked to use his influence to promote better relations between the Imam and the Idrlsl and to Inform this Residency of further developments of the proposed conference, writes on the 35th January 1923 that nothing tangible is yet in view. Saiyid Abdulla bin Kassim is still making efforts but the idrisi thinks that there Is lank, of sincerity on the part of both the Saiyid and the imam. Captain Pazlu&amp;iin has sent to this Residency copies of letters written by Mahmud Radhlm, ex-'/ali of Yemen, to the Italian Governor of Assab, Mustafa Kernel Pasha, Saad Zaghloul i^asha^ am to several Turkish officials at Constantinople | b&lt;58ides Sheikh Ahmed Fitini of fall. These letters have been intercepted by the tdrlsi officials at Ba^il and the originals are with Sayed Mustafa el | Idrisi. The contents of these letters confirm I t he reports that Mahmurl Rad hint is actively engaged in carrying on anti-British and anti-idrisi I 'propaganda in the Yemen with the support of Italian I authorities in Critrea. The departure of the I messenger who was to carry the letters to constant!- nople and Angora was delayed for lack of funds for! it i8 said arrangements were r^ein^ mde with | *' ne Italian Governor or a a bed. Copies or thi« interesting correspondence ore being sent to the Colonial oriice separately’. It la reported that a party oi 4 Turkish ofiioers including one Mohaminei Fathei dey. representative or Keiaal Pasha, landed recently | Trom a French ship at Mocha. Mohammed Fa the! hey is Raid to have wired to the Imam or Sanaa and obtained his permission ior the French Government | t0 re-light the Lighthouse at Mocha. The party I then isit for Sanaa, but the further orient or their j mission is not known. PKQTSSTORATS . Since the despatch or my last letter the Zaidi encroachaents on the Protectorate have increased in spite or the promises given oy the I mam am his envoy in Men to stop further Zaiii aggression against our tribes. In the Subehi country the Zsldie having received reinforcements soon after the Abdali Sultan had withdrawn hio soldiers posted on the Subehi borders, advanced from wadi Meadin and re-occupied Am Farsha. They then attached the M&amp;nsuris, a Subehi sub-tribe, and Killed some ox them including Sheikh Shahar bin Saif, the Mausuri Sheikh. Thereupon some of the tribesmen of the Abdali Sultan ere reported to have gone to the help or the Mansuris as the dead Sheikh was the uncle of one of the Abdali 's■ fcbdali*8 family. The other Suhehi tribe8, sueh as M am a i s, T u 1 e i 1 s, Soma ti s and Atil'is roll owe. i. s ui t and a fight enouad resulting in several casualties on noth ©idee. The Abdali Sultan has supplied the Subehis with foodstuff© and also given them arm© and amisuniilon from the stooK sent to him from this Residency. SheiKh Raid Saleh, the imsmic oomuender at Mawia , recently sent threatening letters to the Haushabi Saltan summoning him to come to re^. him. The Sultan was advised by this Residency to refuse, but to send a representative, if he wished, to ascertain what Raid Saleh has to say. Letters from the Haushabi and a mail Sultana have now been received reporting that Kaici Saleh has crossed, tie border into the Haushabl territory. Fighting is said to be proceeding and the hsushabi Sultan has written to this Residency asKing for ?.rms and ammunition. Re has bean sent 60 Le oras rifle© th a reasonable quantity of ammunition and promised .more if necessity arises* Several aeroplane reconnaissances have been carried out over the country and no signs of fighting or disturbance weseen, I have reason therefore to thing that the reports of fighting on the Hauehabi border are much axaggerated. Fighting Is continuing in the Halfan country. The Zaidis Eire reported to have received, reinforcements and to have occupied several places. In consequence the Halfan tribes vacated some v-illageB ^ the valleys and established themselves inin the hills. MuKbil Abdnlle, the nephew or the zXs Koteibi SheiKh and Abdul Hamid, brother of the Arair of Jala, referred to in my letter dated 3fcth September 13 31, have been sent by the Zaidle from Kadira to the Halfan country in order to persuade tho Had fan trioes to max© their submission to the Imam, but so far their efforts have proved fruitless. I hava at the request of the Koteibi Sheikh sent the A * ,dr or has men living at Lahej sinoe the oobupatlon of his country by the Zaidis, to the Ha ifan country to ooun teraot the machinations or his brother &amp;nd Muxoix Andulla. Acoordin^ to the report lately received train Mr Mohamad Salim. Interpreter of this Residency, who has been deputed to the Hadfsn country to report on the situation there, it appears that the padfsn tribes are gradually ejecting the Zaidis from the villages taKen from them. The Saidi losses are reported to be considerably heavier than those of the Half an tribes. Further anas end ammunition * and lood-stuffs have been sent to Radian from Aden and l thinx the tribesmen are able to hold their i own. Reports received from the Bed.a country state that the Zaidis advanced from Suwadia and attacked Alar and Zahra. The Beds tribesmen are said to have repulsed the Zaidis who are said to have lost about po men in killed.

According to the news received by Captain i» 8 zluooin, Political Officer, Kodeida, from his news agents, it appears that the situation on the Bajil front is quiet. Our Menekha agent reports that Sayed Ahmed, son of the lraa;:i of Sanaa, with 36o Caidi re gulars, has proceeded to the Ivaza of Hajja for the purpose of recruiting soldiers there as well as from the haza of Anran. Sheifh ahomed nassen-el- anifi, the chief Sheikh of bilad nous and neni Hanlol, is said to be expected shortly a.t rajja with 460 men of the tribes under him to join bayed hmeo. It is said that these recruits will be sent to nilac-es- Sheraf to punish the innabita its of that place who hove r Tolted against tne imam. The same a: ent reports that bayed Ahmed Jahhai*, i-namic commander, has succeeded in capturing Bayed Ali Nami, Anil of Kahlen, 4io has raised the revolt in the Bilad-es-Bheraf. A fight is reported to nave taken place between the tribes of Al-Ashur, under tne Amil of Zabid, and the tribe oi mbmul, su ject to tne control of the Amil of udein, resulting in 14 men killed on both sioes. noth the Anils are said to be blaming each other for the incident and have reported tne matter to the Imam of Sanaa. ^5. tne; envoy ihmt as soon as tne ^aidis efacuate oui 1 A '’» ^kri&amp;li wultan snould post a part,/ of aia o?n men on the hubthi borders under a trustwort^ co^&amp;nder, who should restrain tne uuUaia from t oin L beyond tneir proper Ikats and send to tne wuitazi earJy and reliable into mat ion in tiie event of ary infraction ox the borders uy either party* 1'hQ envoy naa given me persoizally a solemn undertaking tiiat he will carry out wjzat he n&amp;s promised to do and that he will do his utmost to ensure tnat no untoward incident occurs again, x?ivo principal ^neikns 01 bpper iafa nave coluc in to Aden to pay a friendly visit to tnis residency* luey complain bitterly 6f the Aaidi eiicroacnuiezit upon Mhaib # hawa ant uubeatein and tiiat ovii^ to t/iia taey are losii^ a good deal of their revenues which they derive from these places according to tne tribal custom* Iney urge us to tame iiu,jeci&amp;te steps to turn out tiie aaidis by force of arms, it zxas been explaiiied to them trxat suui a method if resorted to would only aggravate the situation and that therefore it is neces* sary to secure tixe withdrawal of the z^idis by mesuis of diplomacy, fhe wheiKhs agreed and appreciated tne policy of bovensi ent in this matter. baiyid nlawi cifri. thief minister of ais high ness the abdali wultan, left naizej for ^-anaa on the 24th October 1^21 accompanied by a party of 12 compa nions under an escort of 2o men, with the mo^tor cur which is being presented to the hiiaia uy hi# majeaty's Movem ent.

I have, etc, (Signed) T. E. SCOTT, Matf or &gt; Political Resident, Aden.loth Aden News Letter. Aden Residency. Z t SECRET. 28th July 1931* The foliov/ing is a suimary of the nev/s reported since the despatch of ray last letter dated 30th June 1921. ASIR « Captain Fazluddin reports the arrival on the 29th May last of messengers with letters and a present of 2 horses from Bin saud and his Qadhi to the Idrisi. The letters contained merely formal enquiries after the Idrisi f s health and the affairs of Asir and were doubtless intended to keep alive mutual friendship. In one of the letters, the Idrisi v/as addressed as the great Imam or Reformer. Please refer to Hews Letters dated 13th August 1920 and 10th June 1921 regarding Ebha affairs. Captain Fazluddin informs me that serious differences have arisen between Bin Saud f s repre sentative and Hasan ibn Aidh, the Chief of Ebha. It appears that the cousin of Hasab ion Aidh, Mahomed Abdur Rahman, who was the chief cause of the trouble last year, has allied himself with Bin Saud’s party. Hasan ibn Aidh has the support of the whole of the Beni Mughald tribe which suffered the most in the last year's fighting and has since been waiting for an opportunity for vengeance. AboutAbout a month ago ibn Aidh is said to have gone with a force of 600 picked men of his tribe to attack Ebha, but no attack has actually been made. In the meantime Bin Saud»s party has summoned a large force fV'om Beni Shihr and shahran to meet Ibn Aidh. Mohamed Abdur Rahman has also succeeded in winning over a large number of Ebha people to the side of Bin Baud*a party. Fighting has not started owing to the intervention of Sheikh ibn Hamid, the chief Sheikh of the Beni-es-Salih, who has arranged a fortnight's truce between the parties and is trying to settle the differences. Captain Fazluddin says that both parties have approached the Idrisi for help and that the latter while holding out no promise of assistnace to Ibn Aidh has informed Bin Baud's representative of his readiness to send the force at present at Sharbani to his aid. He has, however, advised both parties to exercise patience and forbearance. Sheikh Ali bin Abdalla claiming to be a Chief of the Bani Kaithoom in Asir visited Aden last weefc to try to obtain our recognition of the complete independence of his country. He was informed that his country was far distant and the British Government did not desire to i.eda_e in affairs in any way at all. HKDJAZHEDJAZ. said Mohamed Alawi ej saggiof, accompanied -V ;&gt;3id Kohemed ^ulchtsr atid four servants arrived here a few days ago from Jedda.h with a letter of introduction from the British Agent, Jeddah, and after paying a short visit to LaheJ he sailed for Jizan last week. He stated that his object in visiting the Iririsi, from whom he had received a cordial invita tion, was to negotiate peace between King Hussain ?nd the Idrisi. The visit of Sayed Senussi to Mecca showed that the differences between the King and the Idrisi were due only to misunderstandings. (With reference to this please see correspondence ending with my letter No.20 dated 2nd June 1921, paragraph 2). If he succeeds in bringing about an understanding between the Idrisi and the King, he considers, the way would be clear for a peace between the Idrisi and the imm end he hopes that he will be able to assist in the consumation of this object. TIHAMA. - ' • Hodeida reports received here at the end of lest month, stated that the imaxi was massing troops at Menakhe and that Hu j jell a and Shutba on the Quhra frontier were being bombarded by the Zeidie. in his latest report captain Fazlud^in states that everything is quiet on the Bajil frontconcentrated at sane and Menakha has dispersed. Travellers report that imamic troops from all parts of the Yemen are being concentrated on the Tihsraa front rainlraum numbers only being retained for ordinary garrison duty. of troops from each of his tribes. Ke is reported to have asked for 2000 men from the Bsni Matar, who however have not complied with the demand. The imam’s son who is acting as Commander-in-chief of the Menakha forces is reported to have made an attack on them owing to their recalcitrancy. to have refused to supply any men except on the condition that the imam agrees to pay 10 dollars per man per mensem and also to provide free rations. occupied a number of villages along the Quhra frontier and in Jabel Reims. between the Idriei and the imamic troops in jabel Milhan on the 24th June, in which the latter lost 13 killed* The former had no c€usu£J.ties in tne fighting but 2 men were killed by the bursting of a shell. The Imam continues to demand allotments The Beni Hsmdan tribe is also reported The Idrisi troops are reported to have Captain ?azluddin reports fighting place, zabe at present. rumours Probably as a result of the continued of the Tdrisi'8 intention to attach the Ztfbeed appears to he full of imsmlo troops The tribal levy In zafceed Is said to havehave been dispersed but has received orders to be ready to reassemble at the shortest notice. Syed Lohanea 3ianl ? the late Anili of Heis is reported to have been appointed Amli of zabeed, captain Fazluddin reports that Ahmed Fltini, referred to in previous letters, went to 1 XasBOw© end Asmara with certain communications from the ex-i r ali, Mahmud Madhim, and returned.on the 4th June* It is believed that he was ‘siven no 1 present but merely the promise that one would be I despatched hereafter* An Iteaian ship is said to have visited Khokha and Taif on the 15th June end. landed merchandise. Our zabeed Agent reports that in renly to j the repeated requests of Ahmed Fitini for Italian ^ protection, the Msssowa Government informed him that the Turkish Nationalists, vho have scored several | victories over the Allies, are very shortly expected to come to the Yemen to expel the Idrisi and remove ' all British influence from the country. „ It is not credible that such information * should have been given by the Erithrean Government. Abdul Shakoor, the Italian agent at Khokha, is reported to have left for Ljibouti. It is believed he is gone there on his own private business. The Hodeida Customs revenues for June have fallen from Rs.42,000 to about Ks.20,000 i n consequence of the increase in the customs duty referred to in my last letter. CaptainCaptain Fazlu&amp;din informs me that an Indian firm at Hodaids. Tahir Vasee ^ oo. h??s made dr, offer of Rs.50,000 monthly to the Idrisi in return for a lease of the Customs under certain conditions, the most important of ich is that the rate of duty should be reduced. The idrisi is in clined to accent the offer but has left the decision to sayed Mustafa. Mohemraad Noori, the late Turkish Gadhi of Ibb in the Yemen and recently in the employ of the Idrisi as oadhi of Loheiya, arrived here at the end of last month for repatriation to Constantinople. Captain Fazluddin speaks very highly of him and says that he holds very sensible views about the political situation in the Yemen. in the Qadhi’s opinion the prospects of k lasting reace between the idrisi and the imam are not bright as long as Mahmud K&amp;dhira and his party remain in the Yemen. He thinks that Mahmud Nadhim’s stay in the Yemen is not of his own choice, but the imam will not permit him to depart on an Y account. Ae long ss liahmud Nadhim is In the Yemen, he has to Keep up e farce of TurKish Government and hold out to the people the hope of the return of Turns. in any peace negotiations in which he is represented, he has necesssrily to act in the nane ot his Government although in his heart he helleves that the return of TurKs to the Yemen is not only im possible but harmful to the best interests of TurKey The oadhi is a staunch believer in this view and regards the withdrawal of Mahmud HaAftim and hi.- party as the hey of the tranquillity of the Yemen. Please7 Please see News Letter dated 17th March lest regarding the visit of jerail Bey to Hodeida. As a result of this visit some correspondence h~£ taken place between Captain Fazluddin and Mahmud Nadhim on the subject of the evacuation of the Turks still remaining in the Yemen and the desira bility of bringing about a settlement between the imam and the Idrisi. in his last communication, Mahmud Nadhim refers to the efforts of his co-religionists in India on behalf of Turkey and expresses his pleasure at the presence of a. man like Captain Faziuddin in Hodeida. The ex Vail complains that he wrote to the Idrisi and seyed Mustafa with a view to bringing about e settlement between the idrisi and the imam but he has had no reply. He invitee captain Faz luddin ! s co—operation towards this laudable object. YEMEN (Upper and Lower) . The annual rumojr regarding the imam’s death has been revived, He is said to be deed but the news is kept secret for fear of the peonle electing one of his cousins in -reference to his eldest son. We had similar rumours in 1919 and 1920, which turned out to be false. Fighting is reported between the Zeidis &amp;nd the people of Sharm end Kaleat Shuaf. -he latter are said to have captured tmo gur.s from the zeidis. The cause of the trouble is rot Knorr.. TheChe people of jabei Abnoora and Barat as ’ rre11 aB K ft3wian al sharn are also reported to be up again et the imm. A traveller from Habesh reports that the Tmam has collected a force of 80CC men in Sena, that 40 Hebesh Sheikhs end all the Zeidi Sheikhs have gone to Sana in compliance with the imam's summons to them end that on their arrival the imam informed them that he had sent Abdulla al Arashi a to the British to make peace so that the 3 /‘ could now 'concentrate their strength on the idrisi alone. The traveller says that the imam's army is demora lised owing to the Idrisi's continued successes and that the Imam is very much worried on this account. A traveller from Sana states that the * imam has sent his son with a letter to ibn saud. T his report seems untrue. Sheikh Abdul Kadir ibn Noman a cadet of the house of Noman of Hu^ariya in the Lower Yemen hrs arrived here en route for Mecca. He stated that he was going on pilgrimage to Mecca and hoped to discuss matters on his return journey two months hence. He said that hie family wished to be friendly with us but we held sdoof. He was told that es Hujariya ley outside our Protectorate, we could not interfere in its affairs.ADEN PROTECTORATE. The news fvom Dhala is most conflicting. On the on© hand i have received reports through the Hdush&amp;hi sultan that the Zeidi 3 have nracticftliy evacuated the Amiri country leaving a very small garrison under Mshomed-ae-Shami, who has been directed to receive orders from Abdul Hamid, brother of Amir Nasir. Along with this news 1 have received continual reports of the arrival of^zeidi reinforce ments at Dhala and an impending attach on the Haushabi territory or Jebal Hadfan. I am inclined to believe the Haushabi^ story but it is possible that some reinforcements of Sh&amp;fel levies may have reached Dhala owing to the insecurity of the trade routes in the Haushabi territory and on the Dhala route. The Haushabi sultan visited Aden last weeh and 1 warned him to tahe urgent measures for the protection of caravans so as to leave no loop hole for Zeidi interference in his territory. Neither the Hauehabi nor the Abdaiis have yet succeeded in punishing the Ahl Easier or the Subeihis, guilty of depredations in their territory. (Signed) T.E.SCOTT, Major General.

The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 5th May, 1921. TIHAMA . Reports received from Hodeida, last week, show renewed activity on the part of the Imam in the Tihama, The Imam ! s chief objective at present appears to be the capture of Jabel Bura, which is in the hands of the Idrisi. He has sent large reinforcements for the purpose and has captured a number of villages, but the latest reports say that he is being driven ^ back again. The Zabeed agent reports that the Imam has now replied to the Amil at Zabeed refusing to accede to the overtures of Sheikh Ahmed Fitini, referred to in the last letter, until he is prepared to give the customary number of hostages and to make a firm declara tion of allegiance to him. The Imam also wants to know the number of Ahmed Fitini’s followers. Ahmed Fit ini must ha^ve been informed of this reply, for, he is now reported to have written to the Italian G-ovemor of Massawa asking for the protection of the Italian Government andfor assistance in ammunition and money* The Political Officer, Hodeida, states that Sayed Abdul Kadir, the Chief Mansab of Marawa and two other sayeds have come to Hodeida to intercede with Sayed Mustafa on behalf of the merchants, Tahir Rajab and his companions who have been deported to Jizan'. According ■According to an informant from Sana, the Imam has recently despatched 8000 troops from Shahara, his former capital, to the Tihama* This force was subsequently divided as followsi- 3000 under Mahomed al Mikdad for Jabel Reima 3000 under Jabir Masir for Jabel Bura 2000 under Sayed Ali Shami were despatciWto Zabeed. The informant states thatafter fighting for about a month, the Imam succeeded in capturing Jabel Reima from the Idrisi. The informant also states that the Idrisi attacked Zabeed but was forced, to retire* Fighting continues* I have received, no confirmation oj. tnis report from Kodeida, which so far as my iniormation goes anpears to be merely an intelligent anticipation of events. VFMFN (Uppe r k Lower ) The Zeidis are reported to have no^occupied the whole of the disaffected area in the Mavia neighbour hood* A number of tribesmen with their families has crossed the Haushabi borders into our Protectorate and the Zeidis have called upon the Haushabi Sultan for the surrender of the refugees,threatening in the event of non-compliance, to invade his territory. The Sultan informs me that the Zeidis desired to follow these tribesmen into the Haushabi territory but that they were stopped by a telegram from the Imam, who has instructed Ibn el Wazir, the Amil at Taiz to await a reply from the Haushabi Sultan before entering his territory. The Abdali Sultan informed me that he had received news that the tribesmen have made their sub mission to the Imam and are returning to their country ThisThis news has been confirmed in the main but a Zeidi force crossed our border on the 12th May in pursuit of the Sheikh of Khadir, one of the refugees, and had a skirmish with the Amir sub-tribe of the Kaushabi near Dareja* The Zeidis have since returned to their own side of the border and are now camped at Nabu# ADEN PRO TECTORATE . An informant states that a letter from Abdul Hamid, the brother of the Amir of Dala, to the latter was intercepted by the Zeidis at Dala, Abdul Hamid was arrested and imprisoned but was released on the representation of the Amiri people to the Zeidi Commander at Dala, A traveller reports that the Dala garrison of some 500 Zeidis mutinied on the 29th April• They demanded their pay which they have not received for months, A party of 12 armed Zeidi deserters arrived at Lahej last month from Dala. Subsequently, they came to Sheikh Othman to seek enlistment in the 1st Yemen Infantry stationed there but were refused. They have returned to Lahej and the Abdali Sultan informs me that they now intend to go back to Dala. They are being matched but nothing suspicious has been noticed so far. Some more deserters have also arrived in Lahej from Mavia. The deserters from Dala gave the Zeidi strength in the Amiri country, including Dala, as 560 and stated that Sayed Yahya, the Commander at Dala,- hao taken precautionaryK&gt; precautionary measures on receipt of the news of the Mavia rising and had also warned all the Sheikhs in the Amiri country against carrying on negotiations with the Amir Nasr or the British Government. Reports of the arrival of fresh troops at Dala have been received but lack confimation. A bad ca&gt;se of raiding by the Subehi is reported from Tannan about 6 miles from our camp at Nobat Bakin on the Musemir road. A kat caravan was attacked, 4 men were killed and two and wounded,/the whole of the kat was aarried off# The Abdali Sultan has despatched a determent of his troops to take action against the Kakdumi sub tribe of the Subehis, which is mainly responsible for the outrage. The Haushabi Sultan, in whose terri tory the raid actually occurred, has informed the Abdal that he cannot co-operate at present owing to his pre occupation with the Zaidis.

Tho object of his visit to ilodeida was to obtain the Idrisi'a permission to run a fortnightly service between the Frithtean coast and the Xcirlsi ports; to introduce Italian trade in hodelda; and if possible, to supply the requirements oi the Idrlsian t overnrrent. dignor i»atti^atti stated that he was a partner of the Italian shipping Company 'The Marittima Italiana- of I llano* Xn January last he had intended to come to wear Ida to open a branch but on hearing oi the British evacuation he postponed his schemes* In Barch last, he wrote a letter to hayed Mustafa through one ^heiich Tahir dhunaiti oi Wassawah asking for his permission to open business but received no reply. The object of the present i sit was to see hayed Mustafa personally and to obtain the necessary permission. He added that his idea was to establish a fortnightly service between the r/ rithrean and the idrxsi ports and to make He del da his permanent headquarters, where ht* would liv^ as an Idrlsi subject, eupplyin all reruir - ments, both civil and military. If called upe* to do so. He said he was a capitalist and could construct roads, cables, harbours etc. and also *erk the mines which, he said, lie unexplored at various places in tne dnui territory. Both the gentlemen declared tnat they had never been to rJxekha and had no interest whatever in that uircction. They stated that an Asmara firm named Vaatori * Company, had an agent named Abdul dhakoor at Khokha, who trades on the firms’ behalf between Khokha and As sab. Sharif Hass an Abu fcismar, acting Governor of Hedelda, told Messrs Cinirella and iattigatti that be was not in a position to give any reply to their requests, but that he would consult the Tdrisi. He added that it was ofof no uum for thflro to return to liodeld* before he h*4 obtained the Idriei # « reply.

Ui ^itini is said to have brought back an Imamic flag to Faif* The reason for this overture to the Iwasi on the part of Ahmed i&gt; 1 tini is doubtless the fear of the Idrisi’s threats to punish him for the two acts of piracy which he committed near Kodeida after the occupation of that place by the Xdrisi. It is believed that these acts of piracy were committed at the instigation oi certain itoueida merchants whom the Idrisi has now deported to Jeisan. It is only Ahmed kitlni of Taif the notorious pirate of the Taranto, who is opposed to tiie idrisl. The inland haraniq are his allies and he is endeavouring to obtain tiieir co-operation in an advance on dabeed. There are now about &lt;1000 Idrlsi ooldiere at Uodeida ready for the advance against Zabeed. I have instructed Captain jaaluddin to dieeua^e the Idrisi from this enterprise* (Sur Menahha agent reports that J eman Bey who was returned to $*nakha has submitted a report to the Imam describing the presdnt deplorable conditions ot the twamic troops at ^asfan, Kadwal and Taraf, which he ascribes to the insufficiency of medical and coram!ssariat arrangewentsTh« Ar^il of Har%a t who was askod by the Iram to supply an additional lores of 1000 men, is said to hafr* stated his inability to do ae owinv to the prevalence of influenza. The tonakha agent says that the conditions of the Idrlsi's soldiers are in ^v^ry way satisfactory and that they be ave well towards the people* The Idrisian troops generally are reported a» well fe*d and contenlfed anu accordingly their discipline is good, whereas tne Imanic troops owing to the niggardliness of their rule have to lorage for themselves and accordingly earn the hatred oi the peoples who suffer it their hands* Captain iraaluddin, the political Officer, liodeida, telegraphed on the ?th ultimo to say that the Tdrisi had received a long confidential letter from the Irnaa in his own handwriting, in which he suggests a reconciliation provided he is 1 #*ft free to overrun the British Protectorate on which he intends to concc trate heavily with a view to driving the Infidels out of the whole of the Yemen including \den* It is remarkable that a counterblast os this sort is always received from the Idrisi whenevwr he suspects any rapprochement between us and the Imam* itppnr and i.ower ) , H risin n ireported in the district ol havla ju t outside our Protectorate, The rising appears to be due in a great measure to the bad behaviour of the ^aidi troop© whose pay is largely in arrears* The iwuediate c use is at attempt on the part of 411 ibn i # asir, the Amil at Tais, to disarm the tribes* He has called on all tribesmen to return their Turkish rifles and this demand they consider to be merely the precursor of a dewand lor general disarmament, The final spark was the ill •treatment of a woman by two £aidl) Jiaidi soldier*.

Up to dbte the Calais have respected British | territory and it appears that the Msll has instructions not to cross the border without express orders from ^anaa. The nature of the Turkish propaganda circulated in the Yemen is illustrated by a report vhich says that there is a force of Turks at Hodja* between &gt;eeca and uanaa under the command of Ml Saeed Pasha and that the latter has addressed letters to the Imam, bheikh ahorr.ed Hasir Kukbil of taviya and ..hefkti » ahomed thmed »oman, Kaimtnakam of Hujeria, saying that he is retumin f with the Turks to the Yemen and that he wants the war material, guns etc., which the Turks had left b hini *h»n they ©ysicu ed the iftr^eHe one of our secret agents who has recently returned to idea, reports that th re was a rumour current In Taia while he was there th t an aeroplane had been seen over the city during the previous night and that it had c»ad : r*%t &lt; 11 MC™ • ■me agent estimates the strength of the inihi garrison In TaU at 600 with 4 guns, but large reinforcements appear to h^iv# arriTedsinc* he left. m* trouble in the Kubati country is r«port«d ■ .-m- tn etn by th* /Ucll» ^ tribear^entendering their submission and giving hostages to \btiul tfnhab ibn i Oman, The following information has been furnished by Turks# who recently arrived from the Xemen lor repatriation The Imam is entirely under the Influence of the foilowlhg: 1. hayed ahomed \bu Maib, hie cousin a very influential man with a very large following. *£• hayed ohomed ;l ^ utawokil. vS. oayed \bduila '1 Ameri. 4. dayed \hmed Ir ir. b. ^harlf Abdulla /O^ain. 6, VI i bin Hajeh &lt;V1 ikdad of \nis.

The latest reports from Hodeida indicate a temporary Imamic occupation of Hujjeila, which was subsequently reoccupied by the Idrisi. The report that certain Quhra leaders were wounded and missing is now found to be incorrect. The Menakha- Bajil agent writes that the Idrisi and Quhras are fully prepared to check any Imamic advance on Tihama, strong rumours of which still continue. It would appear that the pro-Imamic Party in Hodeida is responsible for the circulation of much false news of Imamic victories. This party consists of Tahir Rajab and five other merchants who have been assisting Mahmud Xadhim in his propaganda work. They are said to have laid a scheme before the Imam, which has been strongly backed by the ex-Vali, for the occupation of the Tihama by the Imam pending the return of t he Turks, The first step is stated to be the despatch by the Imam of a big expedition to drive the Idrisi out of the Tihama, as the latter, being our ally, is not considered by the schemers a fit ruler for Hodeida. The Imam has been assured that the British evacuation of Hodeida could easily be arranged once a big force entered the Tihama. It is said that under this scheme it is provided that the ex-Vali with his lurkish party should administer the whole of the Tihama with the exception of Hodeida, which is to be administered by the merchants themselves under the supervision of the Vali. The Imam is said to be sceptical about the scheme. . . • • j I he Political Officer, Hodeida, states that with the exception of Tahir Rajab and party, all the people in Hodeida, as well as the Tihama tribesmen, are willing to accept the Idrisi rule in preference to that of the Imam. Tahir Rajab and party are reported to have sent letters to Constantinople with a Turkish official who recently left for Constantinople via Aden. No particulars as to their contents are known. . The Political Officer, Hodeida, reports the death of Munassar Haghir Maruf, the sheikh of the northern Zaraniqs, at the end of last month. One of our secret agents reports that Abdul Shakeer, the Italian agent at Khoka, has been buying land and houses at Khoka and Kataba, and exporting and importing goods to and from Italian ports by a weekly service of dhows. The telegraph line between Zabeed and Hais is reported to have been completed. Tbe line between Zabeed and Taiz is still under construction. ^ Our agent at Zabeed reports that the Imamic Inspector of Public \\ orks, bayed Abdulla Ibrahim, referred to in previous letters, has returned to Sana, and that during his stay at Khoka he built two military barracks at the public expense. The agent states that the revenue of Zabeed last year amounted to 7,500 dollars, whereas this year the people were forced to pay 25,000 dollars. [5587 o—l]The Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that a dhow, which arrived from Massowah in the last week of December, brought letters to Tahir Rajah and party and the ex-Vali from Mahomed Amin, the sheikh of Jebel Reima,and Qadhi Hamood-al-Harazi referred to in my letter dated the 25th November, 1920, and in my official letter’ No. 55, dated the 30th November, 1920. The purport of the letters to Tahir Rajab and party is said to be that the writers were well treated by the Governor of Asmara wiin- informed them that no definite settlement had been arrived at between the Turks an^ the Allies ; that the Turks had not renounced their claim to the Yemen; and that a Mixed Commission composed of representatives of the Allied and Turkish Governments I would arrive at Hodeida shortly to negotiate with the Imam and the Idrisi. The sheikh of Jebel Reima, however, states that nothing more than polite conversation passed between him and the Italian Governor, who asked if the British had taken no steps to protect him against the Imam, but made no statement as to the future. The Jebel Reima sheikh and the Qadhi arrived at Aden from Massowah about three weeks ago to ask for British protection for their country and an immediate subsidy. I informed them that I could not accede to their request, as it was our policy to avoid any interference with the internal affairs of the Arabs. The Qadhi has returned to Hodeida, but the sheikh of Jebel Reima is still in Aden. Yemen (Upper and Lower). A Turkish officer, Captain Ahmed Kamal Ali Raza Pasha, late of the Sana gendarmerie and General Staff, officer II to the Imam, who lately arrived from the Yemen, gave information which in the main corroborates the statement of Mustapha' Azim and fewfik Mahomed, the suostance of which was given in my News Letter of the 22 nd December, 1920. Captain Ahmed Kamal states that the ex-Vali Mahmud Nadhim is employed by the Imam as Inspector-General on a salary of 200 dollars a month, that he was deputed by the Imam to go to Menakha and negotiate for peace with the Idrisi. Mahmud Nadhim failed in his mission and asked for forces to be sent to aid him The Imam accordingly sent Sharif Abdulla Domain to Obal with 1,500 Zaidi regulars and 10,000 irregulars, and ordered the Vali to meet Sharif Abdulla Domain at Obal. Captain Ahmed kamal gives 2,000 as the strength of the Zaidi artillery regulars with 9 lurkish officers and 50 Furkish soldiers. According to him, the manager of the Imam s ammunition factory is an Italian (not Austrian), but his wife is Austrian. His pay is 120 dollars per mensem, with extras, which would bring his total monthly emoluments to over 500 dollars. The daily outturn of the factory is ten boxes of amnjumticn. Captain Kamal says that an army examination is held annually at Sana, and that altogether about thirty-six Zeidis have passed the examination and are now officers in the Imamic army. 0 nnn NeWS re P ort€ ; d b Y tr fvellers is to the effect that the Imam’s Amil at Taiz has 2 000 men under him, and that he has in addition conscripted some 600 Shafais, but the latter are continually deserting and coming to Lahej or Aden, as they do not wish to serve under the Imam. The Amil has been attempting to collect taxes from Ibn Abu Ras, sheikh of Saiam, near Taiz, but was met with the reply that he had never pa! axes to t le urks and did not propose to commence now. The report says that punitive action against Abu Ras is proposed. Our Sana agent reports that, the Imam is pressing his subjects to pay war rA Utl ° n ’ i U1 large sums are coming into the Sana Treasury. The agent says mt t ie people are discontented on account of frequent war contributions levied by the Imam, and that the Beni Matar tribe have actually revolted against him. Ibis agent gives the number of Imamic troops in Sana as 3 , 000 . This figure agrees wi tn.it gi\( n &gt;y Mustapha Azim and Tewfik Mahomed (please see my letter dated the 22 nd December, 1920). r The agent states that Omar Mizjaji of Hodeida, one of the party of Tahir Rajab, has petitioned the Imam asking to be exempted from the payment of duty on goods sen in ° e rriam s territory in consideration of the services rendered by him to the Imam and the ex-Vali m getting the Hodeida notables to espouse the Imamic cause. 1 he request is said to have been refused, but the Imam has promised to consider it at a suitable opportunity. . Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf reports that the people of Ibb opposed the entry of Imamic soldiers who were sent to that place. The Imamic commander .hereupon applied to the Imam for reinforcements, but these were refused. The Imam,however, wrote to the Ami) at laiz directing him to appoint a mediator who could acquaint the soldiers with the customs of the country, and impress on them that they should not interfere with the people of the country. A compromise was effected by which Ibb is to he ruled by Aboo Sallama, the lor*al sheikh and a fakih appointed by the Imam. ^ Aden Protectorate. 1 he Abdali Sultan informs me that the Zeidis are collecting taxes in the Alawi and Kotaibi territories. I hear from another source that the Zeidis give out that they have received orders to proceed against the Koteibis and others, but they have not done so yet. This is probably a hint to the Koteibis as to what they must expect if they offer resistance to the Zaidi tax collectors. A later report states that 200 Zeidis have arrived at Dhala, and that they will proceed against the Koteibi. Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf writes that the 150 Zeidis, whose arrival at Dhala was recently reported, have relieved the present garrison. A section of the Subehis is reported to have made a night raid on Lahej, killed two men and carried away a horse. This is said to be in retaliation for the seven men of the section killed by the Abdali Sultan some time ago for stealing camels from near our camp at Nobat Dakim. Raids and counter-raids betweens the Makhdumis and Somati sections of the Subeihi continue. It is now reported that in retaliation for the burning of Makhdumi crops, the latter have carried away three camels belonging to the Somatis. Skirmishes are reported to have taken place between the Jorabis and Humaidis, referred to in my last letter. The Kadi Atik of Behan has sent me a book, which, he says, was brought to him by a Sayed of A1 Jawwan, named Ali-bin-As-Saqqaf. A1 Jawvvan is outside our protectorate. The kadi says that the book belonged to a party of three mullahs, who looked like Turks and who visited the remains of A1 Marati’. The party, he says, came from Nejran, accompanied by an escort of Bedouins of Ar-Ramla, and is alleged to have been deputed by Bin Rashid- From the further account given by the kadi it appears that the party g&amp;V&amp;Tmt that they were ordered by the Ottoman Government to take a copy of the Himyaritic inscriptions on the stones,there, which they did, after paying large sums of money to the surrounding Arabs. They also took with them small white marble stones and images. From Jawwan they visited Dathina in our protectorate, and were on their return journey to Nejran when they were all attacked by Bedouins, who killed them and looted their baggage. One of the murderers gave the book, which is vol. ii of the “ History of Dynasties and Countries,” by Jafar Mahomed-bin- Harir, at Tabari. T. E. SCOTT, Major-General.

SCOTT, Major-General, Political Resident, Aden. Enclosure in No. 1 . First Aden News Letter. (Secret.) THE following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated the 22nd December, 1920. t Tihama. Our agents at Menakha and Bajil report that the greater part of Jebel Reima is now in the hands of the Imam, and that an attack on Jebel Bura is impending. The agents report a rumour that the Imam is preparing for a big attack on Tihama, as planned by the ex-Vali, Mahmud Nadhim. and has already despatched troops to j Jebel Milhan for the capture of Zaydiya, the Idrisi’s base for Bajil. An attack is expected to be made simultaneously on Qbal and Jebel Bura. Six thousand soldiers with 100 cavalry. 200 mules, 20 big guns, and 6 machine guns are said to be concen trated at Menakha awaiting orders to advance. The Menakha and Bajil agents state that the Tihama tribesmen are determined o fight the Zeidis to the last, and that Sheikh Ismail Baghawi of the Quhra is busily engaged in collecting his tribesmen for the purpose. According to later reports, Hujjeila and some other places in the vicinity of Obal have been captured by the Imam after severe fighting, in which two of the Quhra leaders are reported to have been wounded and one to be missing. Sheikh Mahomed Tahir, the Tdrisi commandant at Bajil, and the Quhra Sheikh, Abu Hadi, are reported to be on indifferent terms with each other. Sheikh Abu Hadi is said to be at heart pro-Imamic and a great friend of Mahmud Nadhim, though he does not show his inclinations openly. Before the capture of the Jacob Mission, the Imam had named Sheikh Abu Hadi as his Qaimmaqam at Bajil. Public feeling at Bura is said to be tending in favour of the Imam as a result of Mahmud Nadhim’s propaganda. The Menakha and Bajil agents report the arrival of 700 Imamic soldiers at Menakha on the 6 th December. They were despatched to Saafan and Wasil. It is said that under orders received from the Imam, Sheikh Ali Salami attacked the fort of A1 Hamala, in the vicinity of Madwal, on the 7th December. He was, however, forced to retire by the Idrisi-Quhra combination, and suffered many casualties, and was himself wounded. The Imam is reported to have promised Sheikh Ali Mikdad of Anis the Amilship of Bura after he has conquered the place. The latter is said to have left for Jebel Bura with 600 men. Sheikh Munassar Saghir Maruf, of the northern Zaraniq, is said to have written to the Imam openly declaring his loyalty to the Idrisi. His attitude is said to be due to a present he has received from Sayed Mustafa. The ex-Vali, Mahmud Nadhim, continues his anti-Idrisi propaganda in correspondence with the Tihama Sayeds and the Sheikhs of Bura. Reima and [5311 bb—}]Saafan Yusuf Hassan, who is in the Idnsi employ at Bajil, is reported to be an agent of Mahmud Nadhim, and co-operates with Jamil Bey resident at Marawa. Idle latter lives next to Saiyid Abdul Kadir, the Mansab of Marawa, and his duty i. lo ,n - « the Saved,^ »ho ie the 1 jj. » Jf Mg.

The Amil of Zabeed, however, refused permission for the armed men to enter the town and the party returned without submitting tenders after two days’ stay outside the town The Idrisi troops are reported to have advanced on Beit-el r akin, lins report is confirmed by Captain Fazluddin. xt v&gt; Our Sana agent reports that, in compliance with the ex-Vali s request, the Imam has despatched an additional force of 500 men to Menakha. the agent also reports the despatch of 800 Zeidis to Reima via Bilad Anis and of 240 regulars with 2 guns, 1 machine gun, and 28 mules laden with ammunition, to Zabeed. The ao’ent further reports that the tribes of Beni Matar and Beni Hamadan, who were asked by the Imam to supply 2,000 men each, have expressed their j willingness to do so provided arrangements as regards their rations and supply of ammunition are made to their satisfaction. Almost all the fighting men of the tribe of Arhab and of the tribes in the vicinity of Sana are said to have enlisted themselves. The agent says that the number of armed men in Sana at present is about 5,000. Yemen (Upper and Lower). A report states that Ibb is now quiet as the result of orders received from the Imam directing the Zeidis to cease all interference with the inhabitants. Nakib Mahomed Husen As-Sufi, headman of Khaulan, who has written ^expressing his desire to, befriend the British Government, states that Tbn Sand went /against Waila, Yarn and Bilad Asir, but that he was repulsed, and that a large / booty fell into the hands of the local inhabitants. Aden Protectorate. It is stated that the Imam’s orders to Sayed Yahiya, the commander at Dhala. are that he should not go beyond Dhala, but that the Sayed has been interfering with tribes outside Dhala on his own responsibility. Some Zeidi tax-collectors have undoubtedly advanced far into the Aden Protectorate, and I am unable to believe the report that their operations are directed by Sayed Yahiya contrary to the wishes of the Imam. I have received numerous reports that unless the Koteibi Sheijdi, Mahomed Saleh al Akram, makes his submission to the commander at Dhala, his country will be attacked. This rumour is probably given out by the Zeidis themselves, who have so far failed to induce Sheikh Mahomed Saleh to visit Dhala to make his submission. A party of Zeidis is said to have been despatched to the Haushabi territory to collect tithes, which the Haushabi Sultan has promised to pay. I await confirmation of this report. From reports received lately it appears that lawlessness is increasing in the Subehi country. In my last letter I referred to a raid made by the Mansuris and Makhdnmis on the Somati section. It is now reported that the latter section have stealthily burnt the Makhdumi crops. Skirmishes are also reported between two other sections of the Subehis—the Masfari and Attawi—but the cause of this fighting is not known. A long-standing dispute is said to exist between the Jorabis (Subehis) and the Humedis (a section of the Subehis outside our protectorate). Some six months ago a truce was arranged between them by the Abdali Sultan. This truce has expired and the Jorabis have attacked the Humedis and carried away their cattle, sheep an goats.wamsmmBm an wa. tuty ma. luty try A a J’ has lais bles the sion ting 4 port the also with dan, heir y of the sted it is i the itten went arge hala, with yden icted imed will have sion. itory .wait i the , and have two this 1 the 5 ago oired i and The Koteibi Sheikh writes that a party of fifteen Zeidis are collecting tithes in the Alawi territory. The Alawi Sheikh has appealed to me for protection, but this I am not in a position to accord. Owing to reports having reached Aden regarding Imamic victories at Al Hujjailah and the suburbs of Obal and indicating a state of alarm at Bajil, I asked the Military Administrator, Hodeida, for a special report. His telegram, v received this morning, states Quhra and Idrisi have expelled Imamic troops from territory previously occupied, according to the latest intelligence. Within Quhra limits there are no Imamic troops, and no baggage has come from Bajil into Hodeida.
