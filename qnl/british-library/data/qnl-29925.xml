Bullard to Viscount Halifajj.—(Received May 9.) (No. 121.) My Lord, Tehran, A pril 23, 1940. WITH reference to my despatch No. 106 of the 9th April last, I have tlie q ^ . -7 honour to transmit herewith a translation of the treaty ot Commerce fnd £^*4 j Navigation between Iran and Soviet Russia which was initialled at Moscow on the 10 th March and ratified by the Majlis in Tehran on the 4th April. The translation is not guaranteed as perfect; it was made from the text published in the press, which was not free from printing errors, and the language is obscure here and there. I asked my Soviet colleague some days ago whether he could give or lend me a copy of the Russian text which is stated in the treaty to have equal value with the Persian, but he has not replied. It is expected that the official Persian text as adopted by the Majlis will be published soon, and any corrections which this enables me to make will be reported to your Lordship. But it might be well to compare the translation from the Persian with the Russian text, if a copy can be obtained through His Majesty’s Ambassador in Moscow. 2. The Soviet Commercial Representative and his two deputies are to have diplomatic status and their official premises are to enjoy diplomatic inviolability. Branches of the Commercial Agency are to be re-established in Tabriz, Meshed and Pahlavi, and others may be opened with the consent of the Iranian Government. 3. There are various clauses based on the most-favoured-nation principle, but there is a significant exception in article 4, which excludes from these provisions any rights and privileges arising out of any customs union and any rights and privileges which the U.S.S.R. has granted or may grant to Latvia, Lithuania, Finland or Estonia. 4. Soviet Russia has won a victory in securing the rio-ht to deal with individual Iranians or Iranian firms. It was supposed that such an arrangement would give the Soviet Agency greater opportunities for propaganda, and the Iranian Government wished to oblige the agency to deal only with the Iranian monopolies. Since the signature of the treaty the Iranian Government have begun to wind up the monopolies whose functions are to be taken over* by the Ministry of Finance. This action is due at least in part to the discovery of incompetence and corruption among the leading men employed in the manage ment of the monopolies, but it may have something to do with the treaty, though the connexion is not clear. 5. Under article 10 arms and war material are excluded from the right of free transit, but it is not stated whether arms and war material may be despatched through Russia on payment of transit dues or whether transit of such goods is prohibited. As Iran wishes to obtain arms from Germany and is said to be receiving Skoda rifles through Russia, this point is of importance. 6 . The list of quotas provided for in article 9 has not yet been published. It is expected that it will be manipulated in favour of Russia. 7. Under article 9 (7) the Commercial Agency and Soviet organisations have the right to participate in contracts for the supply of materials from abroad for which Iranian departments may call for tenders. It is perhaps significant that since the signature of the treaty the Minister of Finance has submitted to the Majlis a draft law under which he would be empowered to place orders abroad without calling for tenders. 8 . Article 9 ( 8 ) accords to the Soviet Commercial Agency and to Soviet organisations the right to set up petrol pumps, &amp;c., for dealing in petroleum and its products. If, as seems probable, this right is exercised only in the north, where alone it would be profitable, no injury will be done to the interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who sell at a flat rate throughout Iran and lose on supplies sold in the north. [5 ~ 58] r B I #t£Co. POL. DEP-J INDIA Oi ICEi t 9. There has been much talk about secret annexes which are supposed to have been signed at the same time as the treaty, but it is probable that other instruments already in existence gives the Soviet Government all that it requires. It will be remembered that soon after the conclusion of the treaty M. Molotov referred to the non-aggression pact between Russia and Iran. Many persons supposed that the reference was to some new arrangement, but M. A’lam was ^ doubtless right in assuring me that the reference was to the existing Treaty of Security and Neutrality of the 1 st October, 1927. It has been asserted that the commercial treaty was accompanied by an agreement placing certain Iranian landing grounds at the disposal of Soviet Russia in certain circumstances. Such an agreement would be no new thing, since it would only be a particular application of the right accorded to Russia under article 6 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of the 26th February, 1921, to send forces into Persia if a third Power should introduce forces into Iran to make it a base for operations against Russia. There seems to be little doubt that at the time when the commercial treaty was signed both Russia and Germany were anxious about the possibility that Allied aeroplanes might try to bomb Baku. No activity on Iranian aerodromes was noticed for some time after the signature of the commercial treaty, but during the last few days news has been received that several of them are being put in order, and that a number of Persian refugees expelled from Russia two or three years ago have been engaged by the Iranian air force. Since such persons have not been engaged hitherto, it is perhaps legitimate to suppose that their main function is to serve as interpreters in case of need. 10 . So far no Iranian goods have been exported to Russia and no Russian goods have reached Iran under the new treaty. Perhaps the landing grounds have to be ready before Russia will allow the current trade to begin to flow. 11. lam sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Bagdad, Angora and Moscow, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, the Department of Overseas Trade, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo.

Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the Imperial Iranian Government and the Jjnion of Soviet Socialist Republics.—(Translation from Persian Unofficial Text in Iran of Farvardin 16, 1319.)

Each of the high contracting parties undertakes, in connexion with the provisions of section (d) of this article, to ensure for the other without prejudice to the principle of most-favoured-nation treatment, the advantages of the national treatment accorded to its own goods on its own territory. Article 3. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes not to enforce, in respect of imports from or exports to the customs territory of the other, any restrictions or prohibitions which are not applicable to all other countries, with the exception of restrictions and prohibitions relating to the maintenance of public order, national security or health, or to the prevention of plant or animal pests, which are applied without exception to all countries to which equal considerations are applicable.

(c) The organisation in the name of the U.S.S.R. of commercial transactions. {d) Trade between the U.S.S.R. and Iran.

[5—58] b 2The (official) residence of the Commercial Agent of the U.S.S.R. in Tehran shall enjoy extra-territorial rights. The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran has the right to the use of code. The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. shall publish in the Iranian Official Gazette the names of persons authorised to perform legal acts on its ^ behalf, specifying the authority delegated to every such person in respect of the signature of the commercial undertakings of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. On the termination of any such person’s authority, the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. shall publish the fact in the Iranian Official Gazette, and at its discretion in one of the newspapers published in the locality where the person holding the authority exercised his functions. The date of the termination of the authority of any person shall be the day on which the announcement was first published. The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran shall, as before, have branches in Pahlavi, Tabriz and Meshed, and shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Iranian Ministry of Commerce, to open branches as required at other places in Iran. Article 6. The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran acts in the name of the Government of the U.S.S.R. The Government of the U.S.S.R. holds itself responsible for all commercial transactions whatsoever which take place or are guaranteed on behalf of the Commercial Agency by the operation of persons holding authority from that agency. In order that the commercial transactions concluded or guaranteed by the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran shall be recognised as valid, the documents of the transaction or guarantee must bear the signature of persons authorised for this purpose by the Government of the U.S.S.R. or the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, whose names shall have been published in the Iranian Official Gazette by the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R., with a statement of the authority granted to each, as provided for in article 5 of this ireaty. All commercial transactions concluded or guaranteed on Iranian territory by the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, if the document on which the transaction is based contains no provision for arbitration, are subject to the jurisdiction of Iranian courts and Iranian law. As by virtue of this article the Government of the U.S.S.R. takes responsi bility for the transactions concluded or guaranteed on Iranian territory by its Commercial Agency in Iran, the regulations regarding the giving of legal security and the preliminary execution of orders issued through judicial or administrative channels shall not apply in the case of claims brought against the Commercial Agency. Only final judgments which have become legally enforceable, and which concern differences arising out of transactions for which the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. has given a signature or guarantee in accordance with the second paragraph of this article, shall be compulsorily enforced in respect of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. Such judgments shall be enforced only in respect of the property and rights of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran which relate to the transactions contemplated in this article, and similarly in respect of other property of the Commercial Agency situated in Iran. Nevertheless, the enforcement of judgments contemplated in the preceding paragraph of this article shall not apply to things which in generally accepted usage of international law are deemed to be covered by extra-territoriality, nor to articles necessary for the administrative conduct of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran. Article 7. The responsibility for commercial transactions performed, without the guarantee of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, on the part of one of the economic organisations on the U.S.S.R., which is endowed under the laws of the U.S.S.R. with the attributes of an independent legal personalitv,£L) 5 shall lie solely with the organisation in question. Responsibility for these trans actions shall not be attributable to the Government of the U.S.S.R., or its Com mercial Agency in Iran, or other economic organisations of the U.S.S.R. Commercial transactions concluded on the part of these organisations in Iran shall be subject, failing any provision for arbitration in the document of the transaction, to the jurisdiction of Iranian courts and Iranian law. Article 8. Iranian traders, craftsmen, and natural or legal persons who have acquired legal personality under the laws of Iran, while pursuing their economic activities in the territory of the U.S.S.R., whether directly or through the agency of persons appointed by them, shall enjoy, in respect of their persons and property, and within the limits of the conditions accorded by the laws of the U.o.S.R. for the conduct of such activities, the rights accorded to the subjects and legal persons of the most favoured nation. The State economic organisations of the U.S.S.R., and other legal persons of the Soviet, possessing legal personality under the laws of the U.S.S.R., as well as natural persons who are Soviet subjects, while pursuing their economic activities in the territory of Iran, shall enjoy, in respect of their persons and property, and within the limits of the conditions accorded by the laws of Iran for the conduct of such activities, the rights accorded to the subjects and legal persons of the most favoured nation. The subjects and legal persons of each of the high contracting parties shall enjoy equal rights with the subjects and legal persons of the country itself to have free recourse to courts of law of all degrees, for the purpose of filing and defending suits; and in no case of this kind shall they enjoy less favourable treatment than the subjects and legal persons of the most favoured nation. But it is understood that none of the provisions of this treaty entitle the trading- companies or other economic organisations of one of the high contracting parties to demand the special privileges which the other party accords to companies whose operations in its territory have been or will be regulated by some special deed of concession. Article 9. ( 1 ) The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran and the economic organisations of the Soviet are permitted, with due regard to the laws and regulations concerning the foreign trade of Iran, to purchase freely and without let or hindrance for export to the U.S.S.R. all kinds of Iranian goods other than those whose export from Iran is the subject of a Government prohibition applicable to all countries. ( 2 ) The U.S.S.R. has the right to import goods within the limits of quotas to be fixed for each year of the validity of the Treaty of Commerce and Naviga tion. A list of these goods, with the quota fixtures for each, shall be drawn up each year by the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran and the Iranian Ministry of Commerce. For the first year of this treaty, the list shall be drawn up at the time of signature, and for the subsequent years at the beginning of each Iranian financial year. In drawing up the lists for the subsequent years, at least that percentage of the U.S.S.R.’s quotas relating to each of the (classes of) goods mentioned in the general quota provided for for the first year shall be maintained. The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran may also include in the list of goods, authorised by the Iranian Government to be imported during the current financial year, other goods not mentioned in that list. The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran and the Iranian Ministry of Commerce shall fix the quantity of these goods, and the Iranian Ministry of Commerce shall give favourable consideration to the proposals of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in this matter. The quota for each class of import included in the list may in the course of the year be increased by agreement between the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran and the Iranian Ministry of Commerce.Whenever during the validity of this treaty the Iranian Government, by raising the annual quotas, increases the quantity of a foreign commodity to be imported into Iran, a share in the increase, proportionate to the quota of Iran’s imports of that commodity assigned to the U.S.S.R. before the increase in the annual quotas (was made), shall be allotted to the U.S.S.R. In the event of the Iranian Government giving permission for the import ^ of fixed quotas of a commodity whose import is at present forbidden, the U.S.S.R. shall be given the right to take up a share of the import in question during the validity of this treaty, and this share shall be fixed by agreement between the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. and the Iranian Ministry of Commerce. The Iranian Ministry of Commerce shall give favourable consideration to the proposals of the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in this matter. (3) The Iranian Government shall give the necessary assistance to the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran in the conclusion of commercial contracts with the departments and associations of the Iranian Government, and with the associations operating on behalf of the (Iranian) Government, for the purchase of Iranian and the sale of Soviet goods, the handling of which is within the scope of the departments and associations in question, at the usual rates and under the usual conditions. The Government of the U.S.S.R. agrees for its part that the total value of Soviet imports into Iran, sold for rials according to the relevant contracts to the Iranian Government and to the departments and associations above mentioned, shall at least not be less than the total value of goods purchased in rials from the Iranian Government and the departments and associations above mentioned, and exported from Iran. (4) The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran and the economic organisations of the Soviet shall have the right to sell Soviet goods to Iranian traders, associations of traders, and non-governmental associations, and to purchase Iranian goods from the aforesaid Iranian traders and associations. The Government of the U.S.S.R. agrees that the total value of Soviet goods imported into Iran and sold to traders, associations of traders and non governmental associations for rials shall at least not be less than the total value of goods purchased in rials from the traders and associations aforesaid and exported to the U.S.S.R. (5) The Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran and the economic organisations of the Soviet, when obtaining licences to import goods into Iran in accordance with the annual quotas, shall be exempt from the production of certificates of export of Iranian goods. The Iranian Ministry of Commerce shall issue without hindrance to the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, and to the economic organisations of the Soviet, licences to import goods according to the annual quotas provided for in section ( 2 ) of this article. The list mentioned in that section shall be tantamount to a general licence. ( 6 ) The Iranian Government agrees not to enforce exchange restrictions, which are at present in force or which may be brought into force during the validity of this treaty, in respect of the organisations of the Soviet, where such restrictions would interfere with the operation of this treaty. (7) The Iranian Government shall grant to the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, as well as to the economic organisations of the Soviet, the right to participate in all tenders called for by Iranian departments for the purchase of materials and accessories from abroad, with the benefit of the conditions enjoyed by all participants. ( 8 ) The Iranian Government agrees to grant to the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, and to the economic organisations of the Soviet, the right to set up petrol pumps in Iran and to construct petroleum storage depots and other buildings necessary for dealing in petroleum and its products, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force during the validity of this treaty. (9) It is agreed that every six months a commission, composed of an equal number of members drawn from accredited representatives of the Iranian Ministry of Commerce and the Commercial Agency of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, shall review the results of commercial operations during the preceding six months’ working of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in order to keep the course of trade between the two parties in conformity with the spirit of this treaty.£ Article 10.

Iran, for its part, shall grant free transit across its territory for the natural and industrial products of the U.S.S.R. destined for any third country. ( 2 ) In addition, the U.S.S.R. shall grant to Iranian commercial associations and traders the right of free export to any destination whatsoever of natural and industrial products imported into its territory from Iran and not sold there. Upon its being shown that the goods exported by Iranian commercial companies and traders are identical with those imported, any customs duties that may have been paid on them at the time of import shall be refunded to Iranian commercial companies and traders upon their export from the customs territory of the U.S.S.R. These same rights shall be granted by the Iranian Government to the organisations and departments of the U.S.S.R. that are engaged in trade. (3) The U.S.S.R. shall grant free transit to Iran across its territory for the following natural and industrial products, originating in countries having a commercial treaty, protocol or convention with the U.S.S.R. :— (a) Machinery, accessories and materials for factories and for agricultural undertakings.

Similarly, in respect of goods, not intended for commercial purposes, irrespective of type, with the exception of arms and war material, ordered by the Iranian Government, and produced in countries not having a commercial treaty, protocol or convention with the U.S.S.R., the U.S.S.R. shall give all favourable consideration, and all facilities possible, in respect of an application for grant of the right of transit for such orders. (5) It is understood that the transit of postal parcels across Soviet territory to Iran, regulated by the special convention dated the 2nd August, 1929, is in no way prejudiced by the provisions of this article, and that the provisions of the aforesaid convention remain in force. ( 6 ) Iran shall grant free transit across its territory to the U.S.S.R. for natural and industrial products of countries having a commercial treaty, protocol or convention with Iran, with the exception of arms and war material. (7) It is agreed that each of the high contracting parties shall grant to the other most-favoured-nation treatment in the application of conditions of transit provided for above. Article 11. The high contracting parties agree to grant to each other, on a basis of reciprocity, most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of the transport of passengers, baggage, goods and other effects by rail, and in general by land, sea and air routes.- Each of the high contracting parties agrees to grant to the other most favoured-nation treatment, both in respect of the fares, freight rates and all other charges connected with transport, and in respect of the ordering, arrange ment and speed of transport on all the routes mentioned above. Article 12. (1) Vessels plying in the Caspian under the flag of either of the high contracting parties shall be treated in all ways in the same manner as the national vessels when in the ports of the other high contracting party, whether during arrival, stay in port, or departure. (2) The vessels in question shall pay no port dues other than those imposed by law upon the national vessels, under the same conditions and with the same exemptions. For purposes of collection of the above dues, the following articles shall not be deemed to be imports or exports : — (a) Passengers’ baggage not forming part of the cargo; that is to say, every thing conveyed in virtue of a registration ticket and small hand packages. (b) Fuel and provisions for crews and passengers and the necessary equipment of the vessel, up to the amount required for the voyage, on condition that the aforesaid necessaries are not landed from the vessel and left in port.

(d) Cargo carried by vessels of under 3^ tons burden. (e) Cargo transhipped for the purpose of continuing its voyage. ( 3 ) Cabotage is the exclusive right of the national vessels of the high con tracting party; nevertheless, it is agreed that each of the high contracting parties shall grant the right of cabotage for the transport of passengers and baggage on the Caspian Sea to vessels plying under the flag of the other party. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, each of the high con tracting parties reserves for its own vessels the exclusive right of fishing in its coastal waters up to a limit of 10 nautical miles, and reserves the right to grant special reliefs and privileges in connexion with imports of fish caught by vessels plying under its own flag. (5) Vessels plying under the flag of one of the high contracting parties in seas others than the Caspian shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the territorial waters and ports of the other high contracting party, in the matter of navigation and dues of all kinds.

Article 14. Tonnage certificates for shipping, given by the competent authorities of the hig'h contracting parties to vessels plying under the flag of Iran or of the U.S.S.R. in the Caspian Sea, and notified by those authorities on behalf of either of the high contracting parties to the other high contracting party, shall be officially accepted on a basis of reciprocity in the ports of the two Govern ments. Vessels holding such certificates shall not be subject to further assess ment in the ports of the other party. Furthermore, certificates of seaworthiness,9 loading lines, and other technical documents of navigation, supplied to ships by the authorities mentioned above, shall be accepted on a basis of reciprocity in the Caspian ports of both of the high contracting parties. Article 15. The high contracting parties are agreed that, in respect of sanitary measures to be undertaken in the case of the vessels of either of the high contracting parties in the Caspian ports of the other, the provisions of the International Sanitary Convention signed in Paris on the 26th June, 1926, with due regard to the observations made by each of the high contracting parties at the time of signature, shall be applied. Article 16. This treaty shall be ratified. This treaty is concluded for a period of three years, and shall come into force as from the day of the exchange of ratifications, which shall take place as soon as possible in Moscow. But the treaty shall come into force provisionally as from the date of signa ture. The interval between the signature and the exchange of ratifications shall be reckoned as part of the aforesaid period of three years. Should either of the high contracting parties fail to signify its denunciation of this treaty six months previous to the expiry of the aforesaid three-year period, the treaty shall ipso facto be deemed to be prolonged for an indefinite period. In this event, the treaty may be denounced at any time after six months’ notice. This treaty is drawn up in two copies, each copy being written in the Persian and Russian languages, and each of the two texts is of equal validity. Done at Tehran, the fifth day of Farvardin, 1319, equivalent to the twenty- fifth day of March, 1940. In faith of which the aforesaid plenipotentiaries have affixed thereunto their signatures and seals. MATVEI FILIMONOV. MUZAFFAR A LAM. PYOTR ALEXEIEV. SADIQ VASIQI. Note. This document is termed throughout a “ qarardad,' which properly means “ convention, agreement, contract,” and is so used (and has been so translated) in passages in the text where other diplomatic or commercial instruments are referred to (cf. article 9 (3), article 10 (3), (4), (5), ( 6 ), article 15). The French translator of the Journal de Teheran entitles it a “convention.” The word employed to denote a “ treaty ” (“ ahdnameh ”) is employed where reference is made (articles 10, 13) to the Russo-Iranian Treaty of the 26th February, 1921, and in the passages in article 10 alluded to above.

Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—(Received November 14.) (No. 346.) My Lord, Tehran, October 29, 1939. THERE is little of interest to report about the attitude of the Iranian Government towards the war. From the Iranian point of view the policy of Russia is for the moment the one thing that matters, and I feel reasonably sure that the Soviet Government have not yet given any definite indication of their intentions, or whether their policy towards this country is to be modified. 2 . The Minister for Foreign Affairs in conversation yesterday asked me whether I had any news I could give him about probable Russian moves in Asia. I said that I had not, and suggested that so far the Russians seemed to be mainly concerned with re-establishing their influence in the European areas which had been Russian before 1918, and with strengthening their position in respect of Germany. I added that I had noticed the references to Russia in the Shah’s Speech from the Throne at the opening of the Majlis (my telegram No. 166 of the 28th October), and asked what significance was to be attached to them. His Excellency replied that the Irano-Soviet Commercial Agreement had expired oyer a year ago, and that the Shah had simply referred to it because the negotia tions for a new one had hung fire for so long. In referring to the various rumours of Russian intentions which have circulated in Tehran, 'he said that there were no serious concentrations of Russian forces near the Iranian frontiers; there had been various troop movements, but these seemed to be mostly in the nature of transfers of troops between European and Asiatic Russia. 3. There is no doubt that anxiety as to Russian intentions persists, and naturally so. The Iranian Government fear that the longer the war lasts the greater will be the opportunities for Russia to follow unchecked any policy in regard to her weaker neighbours which may appeal to the Kremlin. 4. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that those who represent the Shah s views see that Hitler’s “ peace offer ' afforded no basis for negotiation. M. Jam (then Prime Minister, now Minister of the Court) told me after the speech that he thought it the speech of a madman. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is rather found of speculating in general terms, has spoken to me of what Hitler's position might now be if he had kept the undertaking given at Munich to settle future questions by peaceful means. If he had done so, M. A Tam said, he would almost certainly have obtained all that Germany needed’ and would now be one of the most popular figures in the world. These remarks are, I am aware, of no particular intrinsic interest; but both M. Jam and M. A Tam are, or were, fairly close to the Shah, and one may suppose that their views as to Hitler’s responsibility for the war reflect those of His Majesty. 5. The commercial and financial situation of Iran naturally remains difficult. There is now a tendency to turn to the United States for supplies, and enquiries are being made there for, among other things, rails, tyres, aeroplanes and a loan. I am told that the Iranian Government are becoming suspicious of German assurances that they will be able to continue supplies of machinerv and other industrial material on a practically undiminished scale. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo.

In the course of the soeech with which the Shah opened the new parliament on October 26th His majesty said that his relations with all countries and particularly Iran’s neighbours were based on reciprocal friendship and resoect. He added that he honed that commercial relations with U.2.S.R. would soon return to normal ’‘within the legal framework of the country”.A f Copy, (E 6970/5126/54) No . 514 . 752/2/39) My Lord, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that a member of my staff, in the course of a recent conversation with an official of the Personnel Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also has duties connected with the sections dealing with the Press, was informed that the Japanese Minister had that same day called to see him. 2, Monsieur Nakayama having concluded the business which formed the pretext for his visit proceeded to give his views on Soviet-German policy in Asia. He laid stress on propaganda which is being conducted possibly under the inspiration or with the connivance of the Germans with a view to the conclusion of a fresh Irano-Soviet commercial agreement. Once this had been concluded the Soviet Government could he said, be in a better position to carry on propaganda and already the new Soviet Ambassador had arrived (See my despatch No. 315 of the 28th September 1939) with extra staff. The result of this, Monsieur Nakayama said, would certainly be that Soviet demands on Iran would steadily increase, and the Iranian Government would not be in a position to resist them. 3. Monsieur Nakayama explained the aim of these attempts at Soviet penetration into Iran as being a step on the road to the possession of India, an age-old goal; the realization of which would entail a permanent occupation of at least part of Iran. / 4 .

(No. 118.) Sir, Moscow, March 18, 1937. OF all the neighbours of the Soviet Union, Iran is the least-often mentioned in the Soviet press. With the exception of a brief, but surprisingly warm, tribute to the late Minister of Finance, Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Davar, I have seen scarcely a reference to Iranian affairs during the last two years, and nothing indicative of the slightest friction between the two countries. The accompanying article, taken from the Journal de Moscou of the 16th March, is therefore of a certain interest^ 1 ) Though it concludes with an expression of confidence that the Iranian authorities will not tolerate the use of their country by Germany as a base of operations, the article as a whole evinces the clearest concern at the success of German propaganda in that country, and suggests that a number of Soviet-Iranian difficulties which have arisen in the course of the last year are due to this propaganda, if they are not actually “ 1 ’echo du germanophilisme mis a la mode par certains fonctionnaires iraniens.' It is also suggested that an alleged recent cooling-off in the relations between Iran and ‘ ‘ such countries as France and Czechoslovakia” may be attributed to the same cause. 2 . The article is padded out, in the usual Soviet fashion, with a good deal that is far-fetched and absurd. The writer does not hesitate, for instance, to insinuate that as a result of Dr. Schacht's recent journey, Persia is now included in the field of Germany’s colonial aspirations, and that the memoirs of Wassmuss, which are shortly to be published in Germany, will serve as a useful handbook for the emissaries of fascism now working in Iran. And in his review of the growth of German influence since the war he conveniently forgets to mention that that influence suffered an important set-back when the construction of the northern section of the trunk railway was transferred from German to other hands. He does, however, assert that apart from the few dozen German specialists in the service of the Iranian Government, there are about 800 other German subjects engaged in economic or cultural activities, and that these are especially to be found in the regions bordering on the Soviet frontiers, where they are in close contact with Japanese agents and Russian refugees. It would be interesting to know whether there is any truth in this assertion, and whether, in particular, the very large figure for the German colony is correct. 3. For the rest, the Soviet Government are evidently more than a little nervous at the possibility of a German air service to Japan via Iran and Afghanistan. I gather from the reports I have seen from time to time in the print sections that the Afghan Government are not very likely to view this project with favour, but in any event one would have supposed that Soviet influence in Sinkiang was quite sufficient to give the Moscow authorities a deciding voice in the matter. 4 .

WITH reference to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s despatch No. 440 E. of the 5th October last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a cutting^ 1 ) from the Journal de Teheran of the 11th November regarding the commercial and other agreements recently concluded between Iran and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 2 . Mention is made of “ les diverses conventions secondaires conchies successivement on siniultanement,” which do not appear to have been published in Tehran. These conventions apparently refer to sanitary measures, means of fighting against locusts and animal diseases, and arrangements with regard to transport. The latter agreement is said to settle all differences between the two countries relative to rail, maritime and transit transport. Under this convention Iran undertakes to equip her Caspian Sea ports—at least in the way of signals, quays and depots. 3. The total value of goods to be imported from the Union during the current year against equivalent exports from Iran is stated to be 180 million rials (about Jt2,117,600). Increases of 20 million rials in each of the two succeeding years are anticipated. 4. The article goes on to mention the barter trade between Iran and Sweden, and the activities of the Svenska Entreprenad Bolaget (“ Senbat ”), which has obtained contracts for railway workshops at Tabriz and the construction of the sugar refinery at Mianduab. 5. Finally, mention is made of the organisation for the exploitation of the Iranian railway system (see Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s despatch No. 340 E. of the 10th August last) and the loan of T200,000 voted by the Majlis early in August out of the reserve funds for railway construction. This loan has to be refunded eventually by the Ministry of Roads and Communications. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T.

The exhibition of Iranian Art at Leningrad has been made the pretext for a lot of pro-Loviet manifestations. The acting 3 inister of Education went there with a large official following and the Tehran press made much play with this visit and the exchange of courtesies which it involved. 5. I imagine that since the Shah’s visit to Turkey he has been impressed with the utility of the Turkish policy of friendly relations with the Soviet Government and he may have been convinced by Ataturk that present day Russia does not offer a military threat to this country. I find it hard, however, to believe that the shah has come to love the Soviet Government as dearly as the press articles indicates it is rather a case of cupboard love perfriaps, for His Majesty likes to get a good price for the rice grown in his Caspian provinces. 4.

[E 6277/146/34] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hoare. — (Received October 21.) (No. 438.) Sir, Tehran, October 5, 1935. IN the fourth paragraph of my despatch No. 391 E. of the 7th September last, I had the honour to inform you that the chorus of expressions of pleasure which was voiced by the Iranian press at the signature of the Irano-Soviet Treaty of Commerce had been somewhat marred by a few discordant notes. Harmony was soon restored, however, and the Iranian Exhibition at Leningrad and the visit to Russia of the special Iranian delegation to attend the opening ceremonies have now afforded the occasion for the publication of a number of articles which display the most friendly sentiments towards the Soviet Union. 2 . I do not think it necessary to trouble you with any of these articles in full, since the following quotations from an article in the Itelaat will give you an adequate idea of their general tenor. This paper speaks of the visit of the Iranian delegation as marking “ a favourable phase in the history of cultural relations between Iran and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,” and talks of the “friendly reception” accorded to the visitors and the “open and sincere hospitality which they found throughout the country.” The friendly memories brought back by the delegation “ cannot and will not be forgotten and the Iranian nation will not forget the labours of the Soviet savants in the field of Iranian art, and the “sincerely expressed opinions vouchsafed in regard to the progress achieved by the regenerated Iran of to-day. The more we progress, the more will our relations with our neighbour and friend be consolidated and developed,” and congresses, meetings and other contacts “are firm proofs of good mutual understanding. The Iranian nation will not forget the great and loyal activity displayed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in showing to the entire world the influence of Iranian art on human civilisation.” 3. I do not suggest for one moment that these friendly feelings will necessarily prove lasting, but it is interesting to note their expression, even if they be but transitory. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to FI is Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow, No. 109 M. I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL HUGESSEN.

The terms of the agreement have now been received. 2. The most important feature of the treaty is Article 10 which specifies the goods which are to be exchanged between the two countries. In Article 13 the Persian Oovt. in return for a similar concession on the part of the U.S.S.R. agrees to grant free transit through its territory for Russian agricultural and industrial produce. The danger of Soviet goods penetrating to India by this means would not, however, appear to be very great. 3. This form of commercial agreement, 3330 1000 12.34 which aims at balancing the trade between two countries/14 •t Government undertakes to purchase from the Union during the validity of the treatv the following goods : sugar, matches, cotton piece-goods, cement, black metals, agricultural machinery and tools, industrial plant for the cleaning of cotton and rice, equipment for silos (elevators, mills and electric plant) as well as any other industrial and technical installations, so that the value of the goods purchased by Iran may be equal to that of the purchases by the Soviet Union. The contracts relative to the above-mentioned transactions will be concluded by the Soviet Commercial Mission and the Iranian Ministry of Finance. Imports and exports effected under the above arrangements have to be balanced at the end of each Iranian economic year. Besides the above specified transactions, the Soviet organisations may take part in any adjudications for installations and materials required for Iranian governmental institutions. A list of quotas fixing the value of imports of certain goods from the Union to Iran, showing the percentage of the total import quotas which will serve as a basis for subsequent annual lists during the validity of the treaty, was published with the text of the treaty. A copy of this list, to which have been added remarks showing comparisons with last year's figures, is attached. It will be noticed that no quotas are given for the following goods :— (a) Cotton piece-goods : Monopoly of the Societe des Cotonnades. (b) Silk-worm eggs: Monopoly of the Silk Share Company. (c) Sugar : Government monopoly. (d) Matches : Government monopoly. The decreases in the quotas for oil products (rubrics 9, 43, 63, 71 and 72) are interesting, and reveal the expansion of sales in Iran of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Soviets, trading on a barter system, are exempt from restrictions relative to foreign exchange; nor do they have to produce export certificates before being furnished with import licences—the list of reserved quotas serving as a general licence. Article 12 . The Soviet Union accords to Iran the free transit through Soviet territory of natural and industrial products of Iran destined for other countries. Iran can also re-export from the Soviet Union any unsold surplus of her exports to the Union. The transit is permitted through Soviet territory to Iran of the under mentioned goods from countries with which the Union has a commercial treaty, agreement or convention : — (а) Machinery, tools and materials for factories, mills and agricultural enter prises, and also for the construction and maintenance of buildings, upkeep of road transport means of all sorts and for the needs of public utility. ( б ) Medicaments of all sorts, surgical instruments and dental apparatus. {c) Paper and printed matter. (d) Silk-worm eggs. (e) Tea. (/) Lighting and heating apparatus. (g) Bicycles, motor cycles, cars and lorries, accessories and spare parts. Facilities will be afforded for the transit of non-commercial imports for the Iranian Government of any merchandise with the exception of arms and munitions. Applications for the transit of orders of the Iranian Government from countries having no commercial treaty, agreement or convention, will receive benevolent consideration and all possible facilities will be accorded by the Soviet Union. The above arrangements will not affect the transit of parcels post to Iran governed by the special convention of the 2nd August, 1929, which remains in force.

November 8 , 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 6615/146/34] Viscount Chilston to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received November 8 .) (No. 476 E.) Sir, Moscow, October 28, 1935. WITH reference to your despatch No. 529 of the 11 th October, transmitting a copy of a report from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the new Soviet- Iranian Treaty of Commerce, I have the honour to inform you that the Soviet press has published very little in the way of comment on this treaty. 2 . I see from paragraph iO of the monthly intelligence summary enclosed in Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s despatch No. 397 of the 7th September that Pravda was accused by the Iranian newspapers of being the origin of the curious message published by the Messager de Teheran, to which those newspapers took such exception. The official dementi by the Soviet Embassy appears to have been justified, for in reporting the signature of the treaty, Pravda was at pains to emphasise, at the expense of all truth and plausibility, that instrument’s supposed character of friendly co-operation on an equal footing. 3. The Zarya Vostoka, a Tiflis newspaper, has published the following details with regard to the factories and other enterprises the construction of which was agreed to on the conclusion of the treaty :— “ The representatives of Exportstroy have already concluded with the Iranian Government a number of agreements regarding the construction of commercial enterprises. Foremost among these is an agreement for the construction in the neighbourhood of Tehran of a food-stuff combine, which will include elevators to carry 65,000 tons of grain, mills to handle 300 tons of flour per day, and bakeries to handle 100 tons of bread per day; as also a macaroni factory to handle 10 tons per day, a composite fodder factory, a 2,400 horse-power electrical station and engineering shops. The project will be elaborated by the All-Union Trust for the Production of Alimentary Machinery. “ Exportstroy has also received an order for the construction, within two years, of ten elevators of a capacity 16,000 tons each and another ten of a capacity of 8,000 tons each. These are to be fitted with electric generating plant and with machine shops. There is also an order for the construction of five rice-cleaning and two wool-washing factories. “ All these enterprises will be created by Soviet specialists from Soviet materials and in Soviet works and factories.” With regard to this last paragraph, and to the denial in the Iran that the factories were to be erected by the Soviet Government, most reports in the Soviet press have suggested that the entire work of erecting the plants would be entrusted to Soviet specialists. It was, however, stated in the Moscow Daily News of the 28th October that Exportstroy, which would supervise the initial operations, would train cadres from among Iranian workers for the construction and operation of these enterprises; and the Journal de Moscou also, in an article of the 18th October, suggested that Iranians might possibly be sent to the Soviet Union for training, following the example of the Turks who took part in the erection of the Kaisariyeh factory. There seems, however, little doubt that the enterprises will in the main be Soviet built, whatever face-saving arrangements are made for supervision by Iranian Government Departments and for the employ ment of more or less unskilled Iranian labour. 4. The Moscow Daily News stated on the 14th October that negotiations were proceeding for the construction of a textile combine of 25,000 spindles in “ Memed ” (presumably a misprint for Meshed), and that the designs for this had already been submitted to the Iranian Government. 5.

[E 5740/146/341 Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hoare. — (Received September 23.) (No. 391 E.) Sir, Tehran, September 7, 1935. . IN continuation of my despatch No. 369 E. of the 23rd August, I have the honour to report that a Soviet-Iranian Treaty of Commerce was signed on the 27th August at Tehran. 2. In a statement in the Majlis on the 31st August, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that a new treaty of commerce, residence and navigation, as well as several other conventions, have been signed. The agreement comprised the treaty itself together with a protocol and four annexes, conventions concerning anti locust measures and prevention of animal diseases, and a sanitary convention with a veterinary section. The treaty, together with the subsidiary agreements, was submitted to the Majlis. Simultaneously with the signature of the treaty, certain arrangements and contracts had been signed and exchanged between the Ministry of Finance and the Soviet commercial representation. The treaty was for a period of three years and provided for the purchase of goods from the Soviet Union valued at 180 million rials (about £2 million) during the first year against the sale of Iranian produce of an equivalent value; for the two following years there would be a progressive increase of 20 million rials per annum. 3. The Minister concluded his speech by stating that the agreements guaranteed satisfactory economic relations with the Soviet Union for the next three years whilst safeguarding the interests of both countries. Similar expressions of satisfaction had been made by the Prime Minister and by the Soviet Ambassador at a banquet following the signature of the agreements. The Soviet Ambassador has since proceeded on leave of absence. 4. For a day or two the Iranian press faithfully echoed the remarks of the Ministers concerning the happy issue of the negotiations, but on the 2 nd September the Messager de Teheran published a telegraphic message, apparently emanating from Moscow, which was not very happily worded. A copy of this message is enclosed. The Iran of the 3rd September contained a long article expressing surprise at this message and particularly at the statement that the new treaty was a continuation of the new Soviet policy of extending its influence in Mongolia, Turkey and Iran. The Iran denied that there was any question of credits from the Soviet Union being extended or even requested, and also denied that the Soviet Government were to erect factories in Iran. It admitted, however, that the agree ments provided for the purchase of equipment for two wool-washing establish ments, “ a few rice-cleaning plants and machinery for Government grain stores ; the erection of these factories and granaries would be effected by the competent Iranian departments or enterprises. The Soviet Embassy subsequently issued a statement describing the Moscow telegram as a fabrication devoid of all authen ticity. The incident is a curious one, as the Moscow telegram was issued by the Iranian news agency, Agence Pars, but it can now presumably be regarded as closed. 5. In addition to the agreements mentioned in paragraph 1 above, there is also a railway agreement, which is understood to have been initialled in 1932, regulating railway communications between the two countries over the Tabriz- Julfa line. 6 . Further authentic details of the new agreements are not yet available, but the enclosed memorandum by the commercial secretary, based on a conversation j between the Soviet Charge d’Affaires and the secretary of the American Legation, throws some further light on the subject. The likelihood of some form of agricultural and technical co-operation between the two countries was referred to VX73. in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 237_E. of the 1 st June last, and the Soviet [515 z—4]2 commercial representation at Tehran recently announced the setting up of a section, under the name of Exportstroy, for the preparation of plans and technical projects in connexion with the equipment of industrial enterprises. 7. There is a rather large discrepancy between the figure of 180 million rials given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the amount of the balanced trade for the first year if the new agreement and that of 250 million rials given by the Soviet Charge d’Affaires. The possibility that the shrinking imports of cotton goods, sugar, matches and petroleum products from the Soviet Union might be augmented by other Soviet manufactures and machinery has on several occasions been referred to in reports from this Legation, and the orders placed for granary equipment, wool-washing and rice-cleaning machinery are not very surprising, following as they do on the visit in the spring of an official Iranian delegation to a whole series of Soviet agricultural and industrial establishments. It is too early to indicate to what extent Soviet enterprise will be able to compete with European firms in supplying industrial machinery for Iranian Government contracts, but the shortage of foreign exchange and the increasing tendency towards com pensation agreements, to which reference is made in another despatch by this mail, will be definite factors in their favour. 8 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 205). to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 81). I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure 1 . Extract from the Messager de Teheran of September 2, 1935. Les Relations irano-sovietiques. Moscou. LE traite de commerce ainsi que les conventions signes entre I'U.R.S.S. et Flran ont une portee plus grande que celle d un simple traite de commerce. Les actes signes regularisent les relations entre les deux pays que les traites d'amitie de 1921 et 1927 ont amorcees mais que diverses circonstances, notamment le boycottage des marchandises sovietiques par ITran, avaient refroidies. D’autre part, lesdits actes neutraliseront les consequences, defavorables pour ITran, de la disparition de la foire de Nijni-Novgorod en 1918, cette foire servant de lieu d'approvisionnement et de marche pour ITran. Le traite nouveau constitue un chainon de la nouvelle politique de 1'U.R.S.S., qui veut etendre son influence en bordure de ses frontieres orientales : la Mongolie, la Turquie et ITran. L’Accord irano-sovietique prevoit la construction en Iran, par TU.R.S.S., des fabriques diverses et des livraisons des machines comme pour la Turquie. On ne sait pas si I'U.R.S.S. accordera egalement des credits a ITran comme elle a accorde a la Turquie. Enclosure 2. Memorandum by the Commercial Secretary, Tehran, respecting the Soviet- Iranian Treaty of Commerce. THE Soviet Charge d’Affaires said that the most important article of the commercial treaty was article 10 , the remaining articles being largely decorative in character. Article 10 fixes the. principles and methods to be applied in the commercial relations between the two countries. The Soviet Government has assumed the obligation to purchase all raw cotton, wool and undressed skins available for export from Iran, the Iranian Government undertaking to increase the amounts3 / available by about 10 or 15 per cent, annually. The Soviet Government has under taken to purchase as large a quantity of rice and dried fruits as were exported to the Soviet Union in 1934—35. The treaty accepts the principle of a balancing of commercial exchanges. One of the major objects of dispute in recent years having been that of the valuation of the goods of the two countries, it is provided that in the case of Soviet imports the valuation will be taken as c.i.f. Iranian port, and in the case of exports to the Soviet Union the value will be taken f.o.b. Iranian port. A mixed commission is to be set up to control valuations. In addition to cotton piece-goods, sugar and matches, which have previously been among the more important Soviet exports to Iran, the treaty provides that Iran will make up its balance of trade between the two countries by imports of iron goods, agricultural machinery and technical installations for the increase of agricultural production. As it is anticipated that some 75 or 80 per cent, of the trade between the two countries under the new treaty will take place directly between the Soviet commercial representation and the Iranian Government or indirectly with the new commercial companies in which the Iranian Government hold a controlling share, the system of quotas of Iranian imports as applied to Soviet trade under the previous commercial convention will apply only to those commodities not specified in the new treaty; such quotas as are retained will be on the same basis as laid down in the Commercial Convention of 1931. The important provisions for technical assistance to the Iranian Government by the Soviet authorities, which are implemented by contracts already signed, provide for the installation of some twenty silos and grain elevators in Tehran and the provinces, that in Tehran to have a capacity of several million poods of wheat and to be equipped with an electric power plant. Installations will also be furnished for the cleaning of wool and rice. The Soviet Government has obtained an assurance that with the decreasing market for sugar, matches, &amp;c., due to internal production, it will obtain compensation in the form of increased Iranian imports of machinery. The net balance of trade between the two countries in 1935-36 is expected to amount to about 250 million rials, which is slightly in excess of the figures for 1931-32 and considerably more than those for succeeding years. The treaty is for three years, extending to the 21st June, 1938, to replace the Commercial Convention of 1931, which expired on the 21 st June, 1935. The provisions of the treaty will continue to be valid even after the expiry of three years, provided that notice of its termination has not been given by either Government one year before the date of its expiration.\-AaFy further communication on this subject, please .quote &amp;n&amp; VL&amp;AreM—not to any person by name,Ihut bo — ^ J &amp; “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

Foreign Office, , 193 K Reference to previous correspondence : C &gt;~S i—«-4- /V U* / 1 w- ^ o • Descriptio7i of Enclosure.X I called on the 6th September on M. Said, the Iran OhargS d f Affaires, in the hope of obtaining eoaie information about the new Trade Agreement. H. Said had not yet received the text of the Agreement but said his Government seemed satisfied and he assumed therefrom that many of his recommendations for amending defects in the old Agreement had been accepted by the Soviet Government. In general the information supplied by M* Said was on the lines oi the article in 'Le Journal Ge Mo8cou m of the 6th •oif September, (copy attached). Tile Iraa Qov ern ien t, he sala, had experienced kany difficulties in regard to the question of anet balance of trade provided in the old Agreement. Both Governments had complained that the balance was heavily in favour of the other country and this had led to a certain rupture in trading relations extending over several mouths. Eventually matters had been arranged. Before starting negotiations this time, however, Iran had set her nouse in order. In the past the trade monopoly in Iran had extended to only a few commodities. Trade in textiles, for example, had still been carried on by private firms. It had been difficult to get proper trade returns (values) from these firms. They all wanted to conceal the figures and that had disturbed the 'net balance'* arrangement. Private firms, moreover, could not hope to compete with a monopoly and Iran had been at a distinct disadvantage. As an example of what happened - Soviet trade organs would sell 20 tons of textiles today to the Iran firm ’a' at a certain figure, 10 tons a few days later to firm 'B' at a few kopeks less, 6 tons a few days later to firm ‘*0* at a few kopeks lower still, and again 1 ton a few days after to lirm 'B' at quite a big reduction. That upset the market. /r*- 8 - The only solution was to have one buyer and for that reason the Iran Oovemment had established a monopoly in textiles. In fact all the chief commodities imported and exported would be dealt with in the same way. Sales anu purchasee would be in the hands of the Government. With that achieved, they could now face the monopoly on even terms. Dealing with he question of Iran 1 * great interest in trade with the Soviet Union* M. Said said that the chief goods Iran had to sell - products for which a market might be found in other countries - were cotton, wool and hides. J?or these there was and would be an almost unlimited market in the U.S.S.K. But the latter would only take^ them if Iran purchased an equivalent amount in return. Iran would probably continue therefore to purchase the bulk of its requirements of textiles, stgar, etc. from the Soviet Union. Provision had also been made for the purchase of machinery and equipment. In this connexion I enquired if the report in the 'Moscow Daily News' of the 3rd # ^ September (copy attached) was correct. M. Said confirmed the list of goods mentioned and added motor trucks, cement and equipment for Iran porta on the Caspian Sea. As before the basis of the new Agreement was a net balance of trade. Now that the Iran Government had created a monopoly in all the important commodities, the trade exchange would be simplified. The balance would be checked up twice a year. Turhing to the question of transit traffic, M. Said said that one of the chief drawbacks in the past had been the high freight charges for transport across Transcaucasia. He had succeeded, however, in having tne tariff on exports from Iran reduced by 50% a year ago. Another source of trouble had been the length of time taken in transporting goods to Batum. In many cases the delays had been excessive. This point M. Said thought must have been provided for in the new Agreement. I suggested that the recent electrification of part of the railway over some of the high points would accelerate traffic. The /SovietSoviet authorities said it voulcU M. Said agreed that there had been some improvement* But his complaint was against what had aeemed to he discrimination* Now he thought there woula he a fixed time for transport. Regarding the chief commodities carried in transit, M* Said stated that rails had been Imported from Sweden and Oeraany, sugar-crushing machinery from CzechoSlovakia* The amount from the United Kingdom was small* In exports from Iran, however, the united Kingdom took a prominent place, shout equal with Germany and Holland* The United Kingdom and Holland took mainly dried fruit* I said I had noted in the Soviet Foreign Trade Returns for the half-year a considerable expansion in the transit traffic (last paragraph of enclosure in Moscow despatch No* 349 B of the 12th August to the Foreign Office)* This M* Said attributed ixi part to the reduction in freight rates* Moreover, Transcaucasia undoubtedly offered the best trade route, certainly so far as the North of Iran was concerned* The route through Mosul was more expensive, and the same naturally applied ( owing to distance - and the Suez Canal dues - to the Persian Gulf. While acting as Governor some years ago in one of the provinces in the north of Iran he had tried to promote transit traffic through Turkey, hut the Turks had not proved amenable* They Insisted in opening up bales and cases and when they closed them again they did so very badly* Part of the contents was often lost; in general the goods suffered* Iran's best hope was through Russia* I enquired about Imports into Iran and referred to certain goods that foreign countries were not allowed to send in transit tnrough the U.S.S*R* (Moscow despatch to Department of Overseas Trade No. 144 of June 5th, 1931). M* Said saw no help for that* As I no doubt realised;the Soviet Government aid noi. wish to assist the entry into Iran of goods that /couldcould be supplied from the U*S»S«R* itself. G.P.

A new Trade Agreement was concluded last September between Persia and Soviet Russia and it appears that this Agreement, taken in conjunction with the Agreement of December, 1933 (P.Z.296/34) provides a settlement of most of the outstanding trading difficulties between the two countries. The basis of the new agreement is an undertaking on the Soviet side to purchase Persian rice at a fixed price during the current economic year in return for the purchase by Persia of 50,000 tons of Soviet sugar and Soviet cotton piece goods to the value of 75,000,000 rials, the latter being acquired in accordance with the recently instituted Persian State monopoly of cotton piece goods. The monopoly is/v is mainly directed against the Japanese whose sales in Persia greatly increased last year chiefly at the expense of the Soviet hut whose purchases of Persian goods have oeen very inadequate from the Persian point of view. The Soviet Trade Representative in Persia considers that Perso-Soviet trade should increase by some 250 per cent, and balance in the neighbourhood of 200,000,000 rials as a result o 4 ^ the agreement, which should be beneficial to both countries but particularly to Persia, which suffered very severely on account of the recent trade disputes between the two countries.

[E 6745/30/34] No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon .—{Received November 5.) (Nck 467 E.) Tehran, October 20, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 452 E of the 6 th October, I have the honour to transmit herewith a note by the commercial secretary, outlining the main provisions of the trading agreement concluded last month with the boviet commercial representative, and also giving additional information concerning the earlier agreement concluded on the 11th December, 1933. The information contained in the note is obtained from a reliable source. 2. The new agreement, like its predecessor, is founded on an undertaking on the Soviet side to purchase rice, which, of course, includes that from the Shah’s estates, as a fixed price during the current economic yeai*. In return the Persians undertake to purchase 50,000 tons of sugar—an increase of 10,000 tons over last year—and cotton piece-goods to the value of some 7o million rials. Total imports of cotton piece-goods from all sources in 1932-33 amounted to 168,727,000 rials, of which the Soviet share was 71,338,598 rials; but in 1933-34 imports of Soviet cotton goods probably did not exceed 26 million rials. A monopoly tax of 15 per cent, will be levied on these imports m accordance with the recently constituted State Monopoly of Cotton Piece-Goods, full details ot which are not yet known. . , ,,i , ? 3 . The two agreements taken together appear to provide a settlement ot most of the outstanding trading difficulties between the two countries, and a revival in Soviet trade with Persia, which is likely to be of considerable benefit to the latter country, seems reasonably certain. It will be seen that the amount of cotton goods which Persia undertakes to acquire from the Soviet Union is not excessive and it is understood that the balance of requirements of this commodity will be used by the Persian Government as a bargaining counter to increase Persian exports to other countries interested in the Persian market tor cotton niece-goods. I have reported on the failure of the recent Perso-Japanese commercial discussions in my despatch No. 458 E of the 17th October, and, as the new monopoly is apparently aimed mainly against Japan, a decrease in imports of cotton' goods from that country seems probable unless arrangements can be made for considerably larger Persian exports to Japan The door will thus remain open for a possible increase in imports from the United Kingdom and Italy, provided the Persians are satisfied that the volume of Persian exports to those countries is adequate. ^ 4 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Oveiseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 171), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government ot India (No. 212), and to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad (No. 78). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Note by the Commercial Secretary, Tehran, respecting the Persian-Soviet Trade Agreement. THE following are understood to be the main provisions oi the new Persian-Soviet agreement, which supplements the agreement reached on the 11th December, 1933 :— 2. The price of rice purchased by the Soviet Union in the economic yeai 1934-35 has been fixed at 10 rials a pood, as compared with 9 rials a pood fixed for the last economic year. The Persian Government have, however, agieed o [265 e— 6 ]make a rebate to the Soviet authorities of 1 rial for each pood of i ice P U1 chased by them, so that, in fact, the Government are subsidising the rice export trade to this ® xte ^ p erg . an Q overmnent have also agreed to purchase 50,000 tons of sugar from the Soviet Union during the current economic year, which is an increase of 10,000 tons on the amount agreed on in December lash J 4. The most important provision of the new agreement is the underta ing by the Persian Government to purchase from the Soviet Union approximately 750 wagon loads of cotton piece-goods, averaging 100,000 rials per wagon. It is understood that the Persian Government were even desirous of purchasing Soviet cotton piece-goods in excess of this amount of 75 million rials, but that it was not convenient for the Soviets to undertake to furnish a larger amount. 5. The cotton piece-goods will be acquired by the Persian Government m accordance with the State monopoly of these goods recently instituted, and a monopoly tax of 15 per cent, will be charged on them and paid by the consume!. As according to preliminary customs statistics, Soviet imports of cotton piece- o-oods during 19313-34 were valued at less than 26 million rials it will be seen that this represents an appreciable gain from the Soviet point of view, and this gain must be largely at the expense of the Japanese, whose sales have recently increased to such an extent that in 1933-34 they represented nearly half the total .imports. The monopoly is, as has been previously reported, mainly directed /against the Japanese, whose inadequate purchases of Persian produce have been | for some time a matter of concern to the Persian authorities. Lhe Japanese “ dumping ” seems for some reason to have been very unwelcome to the Persian Government, and it has, of course, made it practically impossible for the Soviet Union to supply the Persian market with the 55 per cent, or so of cotton goods to which they were entitled by virtue of the 1931 treaty. The Persians cleaily intend to use the cotton goods monopoly as a lever to obtain moie advantageous trading terms from the Japanese. It is understood in this connexion that negotiations with the Japanese have already taken place, and that the latter desired to secure provision for imports of their cotton goods to a value of 70 million rials; in return, they offered to take up raw cotton to a value of 2 million rials, opium worth 1 million rials, and to buy 4 million rials worth of export certificates. As this would leave the adverse trade balance in its present position, the Persians are understood to have rejected this offer and to be holding out for much better terms. 6 . It is understood that orders were recently issued by the Department of Trade permitting the release from Customs of cotton textiles lying in the Customs warehouses on the 18th September last. It is presumed that futuie impoits will be limited to such as are authorised by the Government and contracted for directly by the Cotton Textile Monopoly. 7. The full details of the Persian-Soviet agreement of December 1933 have even vet not been published. The main terms were the Soviet agreement to buy rice at 9 rials a pood during 1933-34, this price to be revised at the beginning of each economic year, and the Persian undertaking to buy 40,000 tons of sugar for the supply of the northern provinces. An agreed basis was also fixed for the calculation of the c.i.f. and f.o.b. prices for certain stipulated commodities entering into trade between the two countries; an undertaking on the part of Persia to supplement the Soviet import quotas of those commodities which had been, or might be, removed from the prohibited list of imports; an agreement regarding the adjustment of the trade balance between the two countries for the two and a half years from the 22nd June, 1931, to December 1933; an under standing that the supplementary accord should have a life coterminous with the validity of the 1931 treaty; and an agreement that the accord itself was recognised by both Governments as constituting a settlement of all tiadc differences between the two countries. 8 . The principal difficulty impeding all previous negotiations between the two countries was that of adjusting the trade balance; the Soviet Government claimed that during the period of two and a half }'ears mentioned above the balance in favour of Persia was 75 million rials, while the Persian Government alleged that the balance was against them to the tune of 30 million rials. There is some reason for believing that the Soviets succeeded in convincing the Persians that the Persian statistics were faulty, and thus obtaining the agreement of the Persian Government to consider Persian-Soviet trade from June 1931 to3 December 1933 as having been balanced. It is believed that trade between the two countries for the year 1933-34 will show a slight balance in favour of Persia The Soviet trade representative is of the opinion that, the air having been j satisfactorily cleared by the accords of December 1933 and September 1934, the trade between the two countries should increase by some 250 per cent, and balance j Jkin the neighbourhood of 200 million rials. If this should materialise, the result would be beneficial to both countries, but more especially to Persia, which has \ undoubtedly suffered most severely from the protracted disputes between the two l countries. Soviet imports into Persia will take the form mainly of cotton | piece-goods, sugar and metal goods. Provision is also said to have been made for an import quota in favour of the Soviet Union of motor trucks and omnibuses up to a value of 1 million rials, and a larger quota for motor tyres is also stated to have been accorded. Two Soviet omnibuses, of the mark ZIS (Zavod Imeni Stalin), are said to be already in Pahlavi en route for Tehran, where they will be put into service. 9. With regard to transit trade between the two countries, it is understood that, while the exchange of notes in December 1933 embodied no undertaking on the part of the Soviet Union to extend the classes of goods permitted transit across the Soviet Union in accordance with the 1931 treaty, the Soviet Union undertook to examine the possibility of reducing the freight rates on such goods as were permitted free transit, and that certain reductions in these rates were actually introduced in February 1934. S. SIMMONDS. p g __It is understood that last year considerable dissatisfaction was caused by the fact that, although the agreed'fixed price of 9 rials per pood was paid for rice from the Shah’s estates, other producers were not so fortunate, receiving only 4 or 5 rials a pood, on the alleged grounds of poor quality of rice, dirtiness, &amp;c. It remains to be seen whether similar complaints will arise this year; it is, of course, doubtful whether the smaller producers will be able to obtain satisfaction for these alleged grievances so long as the Shah is satisfied with the price paid for his own crops.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOY PERSIA.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 205 of the 20 th April on the subject of Soviet-Persian trading relations, I have the honour to report that M. Eliava, described as Assistant Commissioner for Soviet Foreign Trade, is at present on a visit to Tehran. No mention of trade negotiations between the two countries has as yet appeared in the press and, according to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, none have taken place, but M. Eliava was entertained to dinner by the Director-General of the Department of Commerce. I understand that the Soviets are prepared, under certain conditions, to purchase the rice crop from the Royal estates. The Persians are anxious that the Soviets should at the same time take up a large quantity of dried raisins which can find no market in Europe, but the Soviets are apparently only prepared to buy at ruling prices, which are disastrously low and would entail serious losses to the producers. 2 . The price-cutting activities of the Soviets with regard to cotton piece- goods reported in my despatch under reference have now been adopted in Tehran, where reductions of 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, have recently been effected. It is, however, doubtful whether even with such substantial reductions effective competition to the Japanese articles can be offered. 3 . Another price war in which the Soviet trade interests are involved in the Persian market is in respect of mineral oils. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were able during the recent Soviet-Persian trade dispute to introduce their products into areas which had been Soviet preserves. Attempts of the Soviets to regain control in these areas and to extend their sales by price-cutting have led to retaliation by the British company. As a result prices of petrol have been reduced and those of kerosene are about 50 per cent, lower than those formerly prevailing. I understand that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been delivering kerosene for sale at Resht at 8 rials 50 dinars per tin, or rather less than the cost of transport. 4 . A local incident which is symptomatic of the present unsatisfactory relations between the two countries is reported by His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz. Various claims of some years’ standing which are said to amount to about 100,000 tomans (about £12,500) having been submitted to Bureau Perse by Tabriz merchants, the Soviet institution offered payment in paper chervontsi. This was refused, the claims were taken to court, and decision in the first case considered was given in favour of the merchant. Bureau Perse having still refused to pay, the Department of Justice sent armed police to recover the money due, having apparently decided to treat the refusal as a declaration of bankruptcy. The director of Bureau Perse withdrew to the Soviet consulate- general, the office was closed and sealed and two armed police posted as guards. Discussions are now apparently proceeding with the Tabriz office of Vneshtorg regarding claims against Bureau Perse, but in the meantime transit trade via the Tabriz-Julfa Railway, which is handled by Bureau Perse, is certain to be considerably impeded. 5 .

WITH reference to my despatch No. 177 of the 7th April, I have the honour to report that no definite change for the better appears to be taking place in Soviet-Persian trade movements. Reports from Resht and Pahlavi indicate that a certain amount of Russian cotton prints are being imported against exports of rice and cocoons. In order to compete with Japanese prices, the Russians are offering discounts ranging from 15 to 25 per cent., and are also endeavouring to obtain part payment in cash. As some customers of the Soviet institutions have received only 15 per cent, discounts and others 25 per cent., a certain amount of discontent has been caused and trading rendered more difficult. 2 .

Si r&gt; Tehran, December 30, 1933. ’ WITH further reference to my despatch No. 585 of the 16th December, I have the honour to report that the only additional information which has been made known concerning the Soviet-Persian trading agreement reached on the 10th December is that contained in a statement made to the Majlis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 17th December. According to this statement, both Governments agreed to abandon their mutual claims and pretensions, and had settled the questions concerning the price of rice and the estimation of the quantity of goods to be imported and exported. As regards sugar, the Persian Government agreed to purchase annually from the Soviet Lnion 40,000 tons, to be delivered at the northern ports and frontier posts for the consumption of the northern provinces. For the requirements of the southern provinces the sugar required would be imported through the southern ports. Conversations were proceeding for the settlement of certain other political and economic questions still outstanding. 2. It will be seen from the above that only a vague outline is given of the terms of the agreement reached. With regard to rice, it is understood that the Soviets will pay 8 rials per pood for last year’s crop and 9 rials for this year’s. The statement regarding the purchase of sugar is open to various interpretations. It may mean, for instance, that the 40,000 tons is the maximum which Persia will import annually from the Soviet Union, her additional requirements being obtained from any other source. On the other hand it may be that additional quantities of sugar may be purchased from the Soviet Union for delivery at southern ports. As no mention is made of the intention of Persia to obtain the whole of her sugar requirements from the Soviet Lmion, it may be assumed that the right has been retained to purchase certain quantities of sugar from other countries, and on receipt of more definite information on this point I will report further. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 240), the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 118).

I HAVF: the honour to transmit, herewith, a memorandum by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Persia for the economic year 1932-33, prepared from the monthly customs returns. . 2. The latter half of the year was very much affected by the Soviet-Persian trading dispute, to the influence of which the figures of trade between the two countries bear eloquent testimony. In view of the very important shaie which the Soviet Union normally holds in Persia’s foreign trade, it is somewhat surprising to observe that imports into Persia during the last year weie little more than 1 per cent, less than in the previous year, but exports other than mineral oil products declined by 24 per cent. As the dispute still continues, its depressing effects will undoubtedly be showm in the eventual returns for the current economic vear, notwithstanding the serious efforts now being made by Persia to find alternative markets for her produce. In respect of one of her important export commodities, Persia has up to the present been very fortunate, as Japan has purchased considerable quantities of Persian raw cotton in partial replacement of Indian cotton, which she is at present boycotting. Recent reports also suggest that the Soviet Union is now purchasing large quantities of Persian rice, and it is considered in some quarters that this action is probably the harbinger of an impending settlement between the two countries. 3 . As has frequently been reported from this Legation, the narrow interpretation of trade policy under the foreign trade monopoly by the Persian Government had led to practical stagnation of the trade of the country, but the recent decision to increase the import quotas by a very considerable amount and to allow the importation of goods previously prohibited (see my despatches Nos. 559 and 567 of the 2nd December and the 8 th December respectively) point to the adoption of a more liberal policy, and already much improvement is evident. 4. Apart from the falling-off in Soviet-Persian trade recorded in the enclosed memorandum, probably the most interesting feature is the considerable increase in the importation of Japanese cotton yarn and cotton piece-goods, an increase which has been effected largely at the expense of imports from India and, to a smaller extent, of those from the United Kingdom. This considerable increase was achieved in a year when total imports of cotton piece-goods into Persia had fallen from 231 million rials last year to 164 million rials. The returns do not show any other appreciable imports from Japan, but since the end of the economic year considerable imports of cement from that country have been effected at prices which are said to defy competition. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 224), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 103), and to the Lion, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 239). I have, &amp;c. R H HOARD Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Foreign Trade of Persia in 1932-33. THE following notes on Persia’s foreign trade in the economic year 1932-33 (June to June) have been compiled on the basis of the preliminary statistics [15 b—4]2 published in the monthly customs returns for the period. The figures are liable to minor 1 changes when final statistics for the year are published, particularly in view of the fact that the present returns include imports en franchise :— 1931-32. Rials. Total imports ... ... ... 669,220,588 Exports of Persian produce, exclud ing material oil products ... 718,024,736 Mineral oil products ... ... 1,017,948,566 1932-33.

It is customary in Persia to assess the balance of trade by comparing imports with exports of Persian produce other than oil, and on this basis there is an adverse balance of 125 million rials, as compared with a favourable balance last year amounting to 49 million rials. If, however, exports of oil products are included, a favourable balance of no less than 1,009 million rials was achieved. Exports. (a) Oil Products. Exports of oil products amounted to 1,133 million rials, an increase over last year of 116 million rials. Of this total exports to the United Kingdom accounted for 544 million rials, Egypt for 240 million and France for 132 million rials. (b) Other Exports. Exports to the Soviet Union declined, mainly as a result of the trade dispute with that country, from 267 million rials or 37 per cent, last year to 103 million rials or 19 per cent, of total exports this year. The United States took 79 million rials worth of Persian produce, carpets alone accounting for almost 73 million rials of this total. Exports to the United Kingdom, at 69 million rials, were slightly less in value than last year, but the proportion of the total ( 12-9 per cent.) was higher. India accounted for only 42 million rials (7-5 per cent.), less than half last year’s figure, and there was also a decrease in exports to Germany, from 63 to 40 million rials. Exports to Japan were valued at only 6 million rials. Carpets exported from Persia went mainly to the United States (73 million rials), the United Kingdom (36 million rials) and Turkey (20 million rials). The Soviet Union was the main buyer of raw cotton (34 million rials compared with 104 million rials last year), and smaller quantities were taken by Germany (6-75 million rials) and India (5 million rials). Towards the end of the economic year Japan began to buy small quantities of Persian cotton, and has since bought considerable quantities, probably largely as a result of the Japanese boycott of Indian cotton. Imports. Owing to the trade dispute with the Soviet Union during the latter half of the economic year, imports from that country fell from 274 million rials, or 41 per cent, of the total in 1931-32, to 169 million rials, or approximately 25 per cent, of the total. Imports from the United Kingdom declined from 93-5 to 79 million rials (12 per cent.), and those from India from 110 to 67 million rials (10 per cent). Japanese imports more than doubled during the year, the respective totals being 25 and 55 million rials (8-3 per cent.). Total imports of cotton piece-goods during the year were valued at 164 million, rials as compared with 231 million rials last year. This decrease was presumably largely due to the Perso-Soviet dispute, and imports of cotton goods from the Soviet Union declined from 124-7 million rials last year to 70-8 million rials this year. Imports from the United Kingdom fell from 42-2 to 29-8 million rials, and those from India from 32-7 to 11-8 million rials.3 In striking contrast to the foregoing figures, imports of cotton piece-goods from Japan increased from 19 1 to 33-8 million rials, and an appreciable increase was also recorded in the case of Italy (from 9-7 to 14 million rials). Japan also deprived India of her preponderating share of cotton yarn imports, the Japanese figures being 4 7 and 16-8 million rials in 1931-32 and 1932-33 respectively, ^hereas Indian imports declined from 27 to 16-4 million rials. Although con siderable dissatisfaction has been expressed in the Tehran Bazaar at the constant price reductions of Japanese piece-goods, it appears to be the case that these articles at the moment are actually able to undersell the Soviet product, quality for quality, and it will be very interesting to see whether the Soviet product is able to recover the lost ground if an eventual settlement of the dispute with Persia is achieved. Although a certain loss of British trade in cotton goods is inevitable in face of this severe competition, the better qualities are not yet affected, and they are likely to continue to find a market in Persia in proportion to the degree of prosperity in the country at any given time. Imports of woollen goods increased last year, the respective figures for the more important countries in 1932-33 and 1931-32 being: Belgium, 5-4 million rials (4-8); France, 4-6 (2-7); United Kingdom, 2-8 (0-86); Italv, 2 (1-4); and Germany, 1 (0-38). The United States accounted for the lion’s share of imports of motor cars and lorries, with 189 of the former valued at 3-7 million rials, and 447 of the latter at 17-8 million rials; imports of these two items from the United States of America last year totalled 672 units, valued at 16 -6 million rials. The United Kingdom was the only competitor in respect of imports of cars, 66 of which valued at 910,000 rials were imported against 28 last year, valued at 400,000 rials. Fair progress was also made in imports of lorries from the United Kingdom, 93 valued at 2 -6 million rials comparing with 16 last year valued at 316,000 rials. Other countries importing lorries were Czechoslovakia, with 19 valued at 1-5 million rials, and Germany with 7 at 732,000 rials. Tyres and spare parts came mostly from the United States (13-3 and 6-4 million rials respectively), but France (2-9 million rials), and the United Kingdom (11 million rials), also supplied a certain quantity of tyres.

WITH reference to Mr. Mallet’s despatch No. ^537 of the 17th November on the subject of Persian-Soviet trading relations, I have the honour to report that according to the local press an exchange of notes took place on the 10 th December between the Director-General of Commerce and the Soviet trade representative at Tehran, confirming an agreement reached between the two Governments. The terms of this agreement have not yet been announced. 2. The first secretary of the Soviet Embassy informed Mr. Mallet that the text of the notes exchanged is not likely to be published, but that a summary of their contents will appear. The notes are said by M. Einhorn to fix the price at which the Soviets will purchase the Persian rice crop—and this price is under stood to be a very poor one—and also the quantity (but not the price) of Soviet sugar that may be imported into Persia. The Soviet secretary said that there fj were now no questions outstanding between the two countries. 3. It is difficult to offer any useful comments in the absence of fuller information. The allocation to the Soviets of a quota to import a certain amount of sugar can scarcely be considered as a concession, in view of the fact that the Soviet Union is normally allotted the whole of the quota for this product. The principal issue between the two countries has been the impossibility so far to arrive at a balance of commercial exchanges satisfactory to both, and any jj arrangement made in the absence of agreement on this vital point seems likely | to be only partial and temporary. 4 .

CUve to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 5.) (No. 537.) Sir, TeJeran, November 17, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 493 of the 21st October, I have the honour to report that no real resumption of trade with the Soviet Union has as yet resulted from the visit of M. Karakhan. 2. A few exports of cotton and wool from Khorassan, some in fulfilment of previous contracts, have been reported in the Commercial Diaries of the acting consul-general at Meshed. A few fresh orders for piece-goods have been placed by Tabriz merchants, and a report from Resht dated 8 th November states that the local branch of Messrs. Vahabzadeh Brothers has received orders from Tehran to deliver 95,000 pouds of Champa rice to the Soviet Union, for which it is said payment will be effected at Pahlavi by the Russian Bank. 3. News of the latter transaction, or rather of the possibility of the Soviet organisations purchasing all, or nearly all, of the available rice at a price of 9 rials per poud (the Persians hoped for more) had already reached me. Tlie Director of the Department of Commerce told me recently that the negotiations were definitely making progress, but “comme-ci, comme- 9 a,’' and he did not give me the impression of being very pleased with prospective results. 4. There are rumours, which I believe to be well founded, that negotiations are afoot for the Soviet organisations to take up the rice against exports of timber to be imported for the Persian railway construction. A certain amount of Persian timber will, however, be used for the northern section, as I understand that M. Xanthopoulo, a Greek timber merchant, has obtained contracts for the supply. 5. The fact that Soviet kerosene has recently been landed at Pahlavi and Bander Shah was published in the local press, this being the first shipment of Soviet oil products for several months. 6 . The sugar situation is not clear yet. According to recent information, no Soviet sugar has been imported through Meshed, Pahlavi, Ahwaz or Bushire since the spring. Imports through Tabriz between 22 nd March and 22nd September were only of a value of 61,420 rials. Though on paper the total import quota for the commodity is reserved for the Soviet Union, it will be remembered that tenders for 12,000 tons of sugar were called for in September (see Overseas Trade despatches No. (B) 181 of 19th September and (B)203 of 20th October last), all of which was supplied by Belgium and Holland. Five hundred more tons were required for the south in the middle of October, and according to the Setareh Jehnn of the 13th November, the Government intends to import 4,000 more tons, 2,000 through Caspian ports and 2,000 through the Gulf ports. 7 . I transmit herewith a copy of an extract from the Setareh Jehan ( l ) of the 7 th November from which it would appear that local merchants will be allowed to import sugar on condition that they will have previously purchased a similar quantity from the Government stocks. This does not give the impression that the Soviets are expected to fulfil their engagement to import the whole sugar quota for the current economic year. The recent appreciable additions to the import quota list, reported in a separate despatch, which in many cases apply to quotas in which the Soviets are principally interested, may also be significant in this connexion and may imply that Persia wishes to make sure of the estimated necessary imports from elsewhere if the Soviet Union fails to supply them. There are, indeed, opinions in the bazaar that the [990 e—3] (') Not printed.Perso-Soviet Treaty, at any rate as far as the commercial aspect is concerned, is moribund, and that things will just carry on as at present until the instrument dies a natural death. 8 .

The corresponding figures originally allotted under the Comaereial Treaty of October 27th, 1931 (enclosed in Teheran despatch to thw Foreign ffice No. 652 of the 16th November, 1931) were 86,380,940 Rials out of a total of 121,128,000 Rials. The reason for the very considerable increase in the quotas for 1933-34 will be better understood in Teheran than here. Sugar, to taice one example, has been raised from 33,000*000 Rials to 98,900,000 Rials. The fall in the exchange value of ersian currency is no doubt partly responsible. Soviet statistics for the years 1930-32 reveal a sharp decline in the value of exports to Persia with, on the other hand, a certain increase in Soviet imports from ersla. Since the baginning of 1933, when the difficulties between the two countries reached a climax, trade each way has dwindled to relatively inaigaifi ant figures. I ? or ’ he first nine monthr of the current year, exports to Teraia amounted to Rbe. 8.1 million (Rbs. 19.7 million in 1932) and imports from Persia to Rbs. 6.0 million. (Rbs. 44.3 million in 19 2.) Soviet exports to ^ersia 60,284. Soviet imports from Persia 44,392 1931. in thousands 32,476 46,453 1932. 1933 . (Jan.-Sept.) of rouble*. ) 25,368 8,105. 49,940 6,978 Tables showing the principal Soviet exports and imports in the trad with Persia are attached (Annex 2.) /As1 ku regards exports to Persia in 1933, it will be seen that, with the exception of metal and electrical goods and cement, the decline extend© to every item on the list and is particularly emphasised in the case of s gar, ?etroleu*Y products and cotton goods. In the laet named it seeme probable that the Japanese have made serious inroada into the Persian market. The exceptionally heavy drop in Soviet importa froa ^ersi in 1933 affects every commodity without exception. Tn the case of rice, the total imports into the TT.a.S.P. from all sources have fallen from Fbs. 67.7 million to Tibs. 2.9 million for the first nine months, and a similar reduction has taken place in the total imports of dried fruit, ao that apparently imports from Persia have not been replaced by purchasea elsewhere. There has been^oine increase in the domestic production of both these commodities, but financial stringency ana the consequent subetiintial cut in Soviet imports in general are no doubt the real reason for the diminution in purchases. In livestock (cattle, sheep and goats) increased supplies from Sinkiang have to some extent replaced former Imports from Persia. The bulk of the cotton imports this year 16,000 tons out of 21,000 tons) have come from the 'nited State and the fall in purchases of Persian wool has been offset by increased imports from Mongolia and Sinkiang. The figures q oted above and in Annex 2, it should be noted, are taken from the Soviet Foreign Trade Peturns and differ very wlaely, it would seem, from the Persian figures (please Bee enclosure in Teheran despatch to the Foreign fflce No. 11 of the 12th January, 1933). The disparity between the two sets of figures is partially explained by the fact that in the Soviet returns, exports are entered at their cost f.o.b. Soviet port or franco the Soviet frontier, while imports are /entered3- ..O entered at their coat c.i.f. Soviet port or franco the frontier. But this would not suffice to convert the suhetantiol halancee in favour of Persia in 1931 and 1932 (according to Soviet statistics) into tne balances in favour of the Soviet Union, as made out in the Persian returns. As, however, Soviet-Persian trade unuer the Coonerclal Treaty is based on the 'net-balance* principle, it is possible that some agreement has been reached regarding the outstanding balance as at the date when the new quota© took effect - presumably the beginning of the Persian financial year, June 22nd 1933.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 465 of the 6 th October last, I have the honour to inform you that M. Karakhan left Pahlavi on the 7th October. His departure was the occasion for an exchange of telegrams with the Persian Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, of which translations are enclosed herein. (’) 2. Since then I understand that commercial negotiations have been pursued between the Soviet Embassy here and the Persian Director-General of Commerce, but little progress seems to have been made, and M. Rahnema has made some rather caustic comments in the Iran of the 11 th October, of which I have the honour to enclose a translation^ 1 ) According to the Moscow Wireless, the Izvestiya had published an article to the effect that the striking difference between the policy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Tsarist Government towards Persia could not fail to have been understood by the Persian Government. The Izvestiya had gone on to abuse the Tsarist policy of intervention in Persia at considerable length. M. Rahnema, evidently under official inspiration, takes exception to the idea that the whole improvement is due to the change of regime in Russia and points out that Persia to-day is also under a different regime. She is no longer governed by a feeble Government which tolerated the excesses and injustices of the Russians. “ The present Persian Government is sufficiently powerful and well-armed to protect its own rights against any political eventualities, and, in general, does not give any occasion to a foreign Government to harbour certain ideas towards Persia.” Moreover, he continued, Persia, by being the first country to recognise the Soviet regime, had helped that regime to • resist attacks from other directions. 3. The Ittelaat of the 15th October published as a special supplement an elaborate dementi of a rumour in a Berlin newspaper emanating from Moscow that M. Karakhan was arranging for a loan of 10 million dollars from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to Persia. This rumour is described in the Ittelaat as absurd and the idea had never been considered. 4. A further sign that the Shah is displeased with the meagre results of his hospitality to M. Karakhan can be found in a paragraph which appeared in the Ittelaat on the day after M. Karakhan’s departure, stating that on the 26th September armed Soviet subjects and employees invaded Persian territory near Gumbad-i-Kabus. They subsequently broke into the dwelling of a certain Turcoman named Araz, killed him and his brother and cut off his head, which they carried back with them to Soviet territory. “ These rebels regained Soviet territory with the assistance of Soviet soldiers who were hiding on the banks of the Atrek.” 5.

From an official coanimniQu^ published in the press of October 6th, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, it seems doubtful if any real measure of success has attended the visit. The Persian Government had hoped for a commercial agreement which would be an improvement upon the unsatisfactory one of October 27th 1931. Their main object is to be able to sell the large stocks of rice now accumulated in the Caspian provinces, largely on the Shah's private estates. The detailed discussions now foreshadowed will no doubt largely turn on this. The Persians also noped to be able to regulate various minor frontier questions which have for years remained unsettled, but Monsieur Karakhan's professed desire to consult his colleagues on these matters looks as if he merely intends to do nothing but did not like to say so during his sojourn here. 6. I had not heard any great optimism expressed before the v isit and from remarks made to me by various Persians in a position to know I am inclined to think that nothing very substantial will emerge from this rather theatrical expedition. I could detect no great signs of real cordiality between Persian s and Russians. The feeling of several was undoubtedly voiced to me by the Chief of the Perelan General Staff who after a banquet declaimed to me in a hoarse snd drunken whleper against 'this assassin who has the blood of thousands upon his conscience'. j. Monsieur Karakhan himself was hindered in his Intercourse with the Persians by the fact that English, and that of an indifferent quality, is the only foreign language which he speaks. I gained thethe impression that the numerous entertainments vere regarded hy most people as a good oppox*tunity ior meeting again after a summer in the country and that very little attention was paid to the presence of the Russian guests. It was amusing to notfce at the Municipal tea party such veteran aristocrats as Farman F arm a and Haji Majd»ud«*I)o^leh. now shout ninety years old and reminiscing agreeably about his visit to iueen Victoria at Balmoral with Kasir-ud-Pin Shah. 7 hatever may be the outcome of Monsieur Karnkhan f s mission I cannot believe that Rea© Shah is likely to adopt a pro-Russian policy. The Generals who have His Majesty's confidence are most outspoken in their hatred of Bolshevism, while the view of some of the more thoughtful politicians is reflected in the following remarks made to me recently by Anoshirvan Khan Sopahbodi, assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affaire. 8. He said that as a patriotic Persian he could aee no hope for his country if she adopted a policy of close friendship or alliance with Russia. Even assuming that Russia and Persia as allies engaged in a victorious war against one of their neighbours, the independence of Persia would be at an end and Russia would reap the fruits of victory while Persia would become a province ot Russia. Why then, asked Monsieur Sepahbodi, should any patriotlo Persian wish to see his country adopting a pro-Russian policy? The obvious policy for Persia was correct relations with Russia and friendship with Great Britain. If anything were to weaken our rule in India it could only harm Persia. Our treaty with Iraq was another safeguard for Persia’s independence. His lixceilency added, however, that in order to remove the last latent suspicions from Persian minds we must clear up all outstanding points at issue, especially those concerning the Persian Gulf. For this reasonhe vns anxious that treaty negotiations with us should he resumed this autumn and brought to a successful issue* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 184) and to Hie Majesty Ambassador at Baghdad (No. 80).

I HAVE the honour to inform you that a “ Tass” message from Baku published in to-day s Izvestiya contains an account of an interview with Karakhan on his return from his recent visit to Persia. 2. Questioned about the character of his reception, Karakhan replied as follows :— “My reception was of a very friendly and cordial character, both at Pahlavi, where I was met by representatives of the Persian Government and of the local authorities, and at Tehran, where, in the course of six days, a very full programme of inspections of new constructional work and of conversations with leading personalities was carried out. On my return journey, I invariably met with an attentive and cordial reception from the local authorities.” 3. In reply to a question as regards the results of his journey, Karakhan said that the journey was in the nature of an official visit made at the invitation of the Persian Government. The chief result of the journey had been that it had given him the opportunity of establishing direct contact with the leaders and State functionaries of Persia, and to achieve a mutual understanding with them over a number of questions in which both parties were interested. It had also assisted in reso lving c ertain questions which had been outstanding in the past in regard to relations between the two countries. “ The results of my visit, therefore, concluded Karakhan, ‘ ‘ will undoubtedly lead to the improvement and strengthening of Soviet-Persian friendship.” 4. When asked what had made the greatest impression upon him in the course of his visit, Karakhan replied that “the most characteristic feature of present-day Persia is the large road, economic and cultural construction which leaps to the eye at every place which I visited. I consider it particularly important to draw attention to the great extent of the construction of metalled roads and of bridges and the successful work in continuing the Trans-Persian Railway. I travelled on this railway from Shahi. through Sari, to Ashrafa and must mention the model orderliness and good condition of the Trans-Persian Railway in its northern section. I must also mention the construction of a number of industrial enterprises, of factories, which were models in respect of equipment, and of the agricultural school at Karaj, the school of old-fashioned artistic handicrafts in Tehran, a number of tea plantations in Mazanderan and Gilan, and a number of new hospitals and newdy-constructed convalescent sanatoria on the Shah’s property of Sakhte-ser. The Soviet Government cannot fail to welcome this construction, which provides Persia with the opportunity of strengthening its economic and cultural position.' I have, &amp;c. WILLIAM STRANG.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 295 of the 17th June on the subject of Japanese commercial activities in Persia, I have the honour to transmit herewith a memorandum on this subject, with special reference to the market for cotton manufactures, which has been prepared by the commercial secretary to His Majesty’s Legation. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 176), the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad (No. 74), the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 139), and to His Majesty’s consular officers at Ahwaz (No. 80), Kerman (No. 15), Meshed (No. 6) and Tabriz (No. 33). I have. &amp;e. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum on Japanese Trading Activities in Persia. REPORIS from His Majesty’s consular officers, more particularly in Southern Persia, indicate that Japanese trading activities in this country are on the increase. 1 he absence of such reports from His Majesty’s consular officers at Tabriz and Meshed would seem to show that in the extreme north and north east the question has not yet become acute. His Majesty’s-consul at Kerman stated, in his annual commercial report for 1932-33, that Japanese cotton yarn, of which there had been practically no imports since 1927, had again appeared on the market during the past year, and by the end of that period about 75 per cent, of all the cotton yarn consumed in the province was of Japanese manufacture. Though admitted to be inferior in quality to Manchester or Indian yarn, the Japanese product is considered to he quite as good for the purpose for which it is chiefly required in that part of the country, i.e., for the weaving of carpets, and it is usually about 10 per cent, cheaper. Imports of J apanese piece-goods into Kerman increased by over 200 per cent, during the year, whilst Soviet piece-goods decreased by 50 per cent.. United Kingdom by 40 per cent, and Indian by about 25 per cent. His Majesty’s consul is of the opinion that since even Soviet piece-goods are unable to compete with the Japanese product, there is even less hope of British piece-goods being able to hold their ground. In the annual trade report for Ahwaz for the same period. His Majesty’s consul stated that Japanese piece-goods had for a time gained a considerable hold owing to their cheapness. His Majesty’s vice-consul at Mohammerah had. however, reported that a demand for better quality goods was increasing, and that Manchester goods were returning to favour, although imports were restricted owing to lack of permits. Cheap articles of Japanese manufacture, particularly certain types of cotton and silk goods, attracted a ready sale, but owing to fluctuating prices merchants probably lost money by dealing in Japanese goods. His Majesty’s consul at Bandar Abbas reported that it was believed locally that in the coming year Japanese piece-goods would oust the Russian product from the market, as Japanese goods were stated to be both cheaper and of better quality, and were therefore likely to gain favour in such an impoverished country. [915 dd—5]The importation of Manchester goods had practically ceased, but it could not be said that there was no demand for them as the piece-goods imported through India were mostly Manchester products. His Majesty’s consul gave the following figures of imports of cotton goods into Bandar Abbas during the year 1932-33 :— Cotton piece-goods— U.S.S.R Japan India United Kingdom ... Rials. 3,051,238 2,464,933 2.070,304 337,670 Total 7,924.145 Textiles and yarns— Japan India U.S.S.R. ... China United Kingdom ... 12,176,566 8,658.000 104,100 39,400 16,600 Total 20,994,666 In his commercial diary for July His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz reported that piece-goods were being introduced into the market by the Japanese commercial representative at Mohammerah, and that the Russians were trying, at present unsuccessfully, by reduction of prices, to compete with them. His Majesty’s consul further reported that a Mr. Kaniko, representative of a Japanese firm at Tehran, had recently visited Mohammerah in connexion with the shipment to Japan by the Japanese vessel Seiun Maru of a consignment of 12,500 bales of Persian cotton, and that Mr. Kaniko had appointed a Persian merchant to represent his firm at that port. Two Japanese firms had recently established agencies at Mohammerah for the purchase of Persian cotton, and it was understood that Japanese ships would call regularly at that port. A similar report has also reached me in Tehran to the effect that a representative of the Mitsubishi concern had recently gone south in connexion with arranging for a regular service of Japanese boats to Basra. With the heavy purchases of Persian cotton on Japanese account, and imports to Persia of Japanese textiles and cement, there would presumably be a certain amount of freight available for these vessels. It would appear from the foregoing that a keen struggle is going on for the capture of the Persian market for cotton manufactures, and that so far as can be seen at present the Japanese are gaining ground, mainly at the expense of the Russians, although a certain amount of British trade will inevitably be lost in the process. Pending the conclusion of a satisfactory commercial agreement between Persia and the Soviet Union, the full strength of Soviet competition in this market is not yet being experienced, and it is possible that they may later make a serious effort to regain some of the lost ground. Meanwhile, it is of interest to note that Japanese piece-goods are reported to be less popular in the Tehran bazaar at present, as the repeated price reductions create suspicions that the Japanese may adopt some of the less desirable tactics of the Russian trading establishments about which complaints were recently made, and merchants are afraid of incurring losses and are tending to withhold orders. It is said that during August Japanese piece-goods were offered at 10 per cent, below recent prices, and that merchants refused to accept them. S.

WITH reference to ray despatch No._391,of the 12th August, I have the honour to report that there is as yet no appreciable change in Soviet-Persian commercial relations. The situation appears to be at present that the Soviet establishments in Persia are profiting by the abandonment of the boycott to liquidate their stocks on the Persian market, but are making no appreciable purchases of Persian goods, with the possible exception of cotton. Thus at the moment, the Persian trading balance with the Soviet Union is likely to’become still more adverse. It is rumoured in the bazaar that the reported departure for Kussia ot Soviet commercial experts, whose avowed object is to fix the quotas for importations of Persian goods, is merely a ruse to get rid of stocks in Persia whilst avoiding making purchases here. 2. The Shafagh-i-Sorkh of the 23rd August reports that M. Shevtsoff the former Soviet trade representative in Persia, has been replaced by M. Michel Snustak, formerly assistant trade representative, and that the directors and sub- directors of Soviet trading establishments in Persia are being replaced by fresh officials who are being sent from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: It is further reported in the Messager de Teheran of the 24th August that M.

Sir, Gulhek, August 12, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No . 270 of the 3rd June I have the honour to report that the boycott in Persia of Soviet institutions and goods is being called off. Ettela’at of the 3rd August announced that, at a meeting of the Association of Tehran Merchants, a resolution was passed to the effect that, “ guided by the advice of the Imperial Government, which has given us reason to hope for a settlement of existing difficulties,” the association had decided to resume trading operations with Soviet commercial establishments. 2. A further report in Iran of the 11th August states that the Persian Trading Corporation has decided to open negotiations with Soviet institutions for the sale and purchase of goods. The same report adds that the acting Soviet trade representative has stated that, in consequence of the interruption in trading relations between the two countries, no provision had been made by the Soviet Government for import quotas for Persian goods, and that he must now go to Moscow, accompanied by other Soviet trading representatives in Persia, to discuss the fixing of the quantities of these quotas. Merchants report that no supplies of Soviet goods are in hand at Persian customs depots other than textiles and a certain amount of iron goods, but it is understood that arrangements will soon be made for normal exchange of goods between the two countries. In the meantime the list of Persian import quotas, which has now been published in the vernacular press, contains provision for Soviet import quotas. 3. The above seems to mark the inglorious end of another long struggle with the Soviet Union in an attempt to secure more advantageous terms and an improved trading balance for Persia. For months the welkin has rung with the cries of Persian merchants either singly or in chambers of commerce or associations I of merchants, protesting that it was either impossible or highly unpatriotic to j have any dealings with Soviet trading establishments in Persia, The very unanimity of these protests in a country where public opinion is unformed and the standard of education among the trading community is low made them suspect, and it was from the first obvious that they were directly inspired by Government circles in Tehran and even ordered by the Shah himself. Some grievances against Soviet trading methods undoubtedly existed and will probably continue to exist, but the main complaint was that of the Persian Government, which was annoyed at the failure of its efforts to achieve an approximately balanced trade with the Soviet Union. 4. The reaction of the Soviet Government to the boycott was, as is usually the case, immediate and decisive. Orders for Persian produce ceased, and transit rates on the Soviet route so vital to Persian trade were raised to prohibitive levels. As the struggle continued the Soviets decided to reduce, and in some cases even to liquidate, their trading establishments in Persia, and in recent months almost the sole exports from Persia to the Soviet Union have been the personnel and equipment of these establishments. There can be no doubt that, whatever the merits of the case may have been, the Soviet position has been much the stronger. 5. No details have yet been published of any new agreement that may have been arrived at between the respective Governments, but there is no doubt that the j Soviet Government had insisted on the prior calling off of the boycott as a prelude f to official negotiations. The result of resumed trade between the two countries will undoubtedly benefit northern Persia, but it is doubtful whether their failure to impose terms on the Soviet Union will have sweetened the disposition of the Persian Government towards their powerful northern neighbour. 6.

Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received July 19.) (No. 310.) Sir, Gulhek, June 28, 1933. WITH reference to Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 270 of the 3rd June last, a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 24th June seems worth reporting to you. 2. Feroughi was discussing possible results of the World Economic Conference and expressing in general terms his approval of its efforts to remove trade barriers and restrictions throughout the world, when he spontaneously indulged in an outburst against the Soviet Government, which for a man of his calm disposition was surprisingly violent. 3. What, he asked, could be the contribution of such a Government to the World Economic Conference ? The whole Soviet system was the antithesis of that freedom of trade for which the rest of the world was now apparently working. Even if the Soviet Government were to put their signature to any form of agree ment, how could such a document be considered anything but a scrap of paper? The Russians were entirely faithless and false. They would pledge their word and they would sign written agreements and then go back on them at once flagrantly and shamelessly. Persia, continued his Highness, was in a tragic position with such neighbours to deal with. She had been forced into the economic policy represented by the Trade Monopoly Law in self-defence against the aggressive tactics of Soviet commercial policy in Persia. It was true that the Trade Monopoly Law left many things to be desired; it was cumbrous and expensive to work and caused everybody a great deal of trouble; it could not be shown to have improved the economic condition of the country—rather the contrary; on the other hand, without it Persia would be now one vast dumping ground for Russian goods, while in return the Russians would still be buying practically nothing from Persia. 4. I gathered from this that the Persians would have been ready to collaborate in the conference’s task of removing trade restrictions, but that they find themselves so dependent upon their commercial relations with Russia that they dare not relax their present regulations. 5. Feroughi then again reiterated his detestation of the Russians and all their works. I remarked that I had seen in the newspapers that the new Soviet Ambassador to Persia had landed at Pahlavi. Feroughi said that this was so, but he had not heard whether M. Pastoukhoff had yet reached Tehran. I asked his Highness what sort of reports he had received regarding the Ambassador, and he told me that he understood that he had never held a diplomatic post abroad, although he had worked for many years in the Eastern Department of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. M. Pastoukhoff had, however, travelled in Persia privately, for purposes of spying, no doubt, Feroughi opined. He was reputed to have a violent manner; Ferougni did not object to this, as bad-tempered people left him quite unmoved; what he really objected to was crookedness and falseness, and, unfortunately, these were the qualities which could surely be expected of any Soviet Ambassador. 6. There is a very strong feeling against the Russians everywhere here at present. The word has, no doubt, gone forth from him who must be obeyed, and all Government officials are consequently busy showing their anti-Soviet zeal. The prisons, both here and in the provinces, are said to be crammed with Bolshevik suspects. The Shah talked quite frankly with Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, who had an audience of His Majesty recently, and bemoaned the geographical situation of Persia, which rendered her northern and most fertile provinces peculiarly [859 t—1]2 /'“'N vulnerable to Russian economic pressure. He did not, apparently, add that this was practically a personal matter to him, in view of the ever-increasing extent of the Royal domains in Mazanderan. I am sure that His Majesty’s keen interest to get the railway through from the Caspian to Tehran with all speed is due to an idea that he may be able to find an alternative outlet for the produce of the / Caspian provinces. ^ 7.

Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union, January to May 1933. THE principal feature of the foreign trade returns of the Soviet Union for May was the continued depression in exports, for which the embargo on trade with the United Kingdom was partly, but not wholly, responsible. In comparison with the average for the first four months of the year, the total exports at 32 million roubles were down by 18 per cent. Imports, on the other hand, at 41^ million roubles were 13 per cent, higher than the average for the first four months. Compared with the first five months of 1932, exports for the period January to May 1933 declined from 235-8 million roubles to 188 million roubles, or by 20 per cent., and imports from 335-8 million roubles to 169 million roubles, or by almost 50 per cent. The excess of imports over exports in May, the first month this year when imports have exceeded exports, reduced the favourable balance of trade to 19 million roubles at the end of May, as compared with adverse balances of 100 million roubles and 132 million roubles at the corresponding date in 1932 and 1931 respectively. The shrinkage in exports during the first five months was most marked in— Million roubles. Grain 14i Textiles, cotton 11-3 Petroleum 3-5 Timber 3-4 Sugar 31 Furs ... 2-7 The decline in purchases of Soviet textiles affected all the principal markets, viz. :— Million roubles. Persia 3-5 Afghanistan 3 4 Mongolia 2-7 Sinkiang 2 3 The development of the fur-dressing industry in the Soviet Union was reflected in the exports of “ dressed furs,” chiefly squirrel, shipments of which increased by 3 • 1 million roubles in comparison with the first five months of 1932. Exports of undressed squirrel decreased by 2-4 million roubles.'1 An appreciable increase was also recorded in the export of ‘ ‘ precious metals and precious metal waste,” which in value now ranks immediately after the staple exports. Shipments in May amounted to 3-5 million roubles, and the aggregate for the first five months was as much as 11 million roubles, the great bulk of which went to Germany and England. A considerable part of this item is reported to consist of sweeps and tailings from the gold and platinum industries. ^ The decline in imports during the five months was heaviest in— Million roubles. Machinery and parts ... ... ... 79-8 Electrical equipment ... ... ... 27 0 Iron and steel manufactures ... ... 8-6 Food-stuffs (rice, currants and raisins— mainly for re-export—tea, fish, meat and margarine) ... ... ... 18-5 Cotton, raw' ... ... ... ... 9-4 Imports of ferrous metals increased by 8-3 million roubles and of non-ferrous metals by 8 -1 million roubles. The erection of synthetic rubber factories, three of which are now in operation, has had little effect so far on imports of raw rubber, shipments of which to the amount of over 10.000 tons were received during J anuary-May. Trade with the United Kingdom .—As the result of the embargo, shipments of timber and petroleum to the I nited Kingdom in May were almost negligible. No grain was shipped at all, but there is little left to ship in any case. The value of timber shipped to the United Kingdom in May 1932 was 3 million roubles. Nevertheless, exports to the United Kingdom in May 1933 were actually higher than in the months of March or April, the most important item being “ precious metals and precious metal waste,” valued at 17 million roubles. Imports from the United Kingdom were also higher than in any of the first three months of the year. The value of the trade in each of the first five months was as follows : Exports to Imports from Great Britain. Great Britain. Thousand roubles. Thousand roubles. J anuary February March April ... May ... 11,712 6.896 4,346 5,374 5,454 3,287 2,418 585 6,658 3,716 33,782 16,664 In comparison with the first five months of 1932, exports to the United Kingdom diminished b\ 21 ■ 7 million roubles, or 39 per cent., while imports from the United Kingdom dropped by 31 million roubles, or 65 per cent. The balance of trade in favour of the Soviet Union at the end of May was thus 17 1 million roubles, as against 7 - 8 million roubles for the corresponding period of 1932. This balance of over 17 million roubles represents almost as much as the entire imports from Italy, the United States and France put together. The shrinkage in imports from the United Kingdom, in comparison with the corresponding period of 1932, was most marked in— Million , r . . , roubles.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 198 o f the 22nd April, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a memorandum prepared by Mr. Simmonds reviewing in a general way the recent trading difficulties between Persia and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 2. It will be seen that the stoppage of Perso-Soviet trade is almost universal. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 104), the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 38). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum by the Commercial Secretary, Tehran. Perso-Soviet Commercial Relations. ALTHOUGH there have been no fresh developments in Perso-Soviet commercial relations during the past month or so, it may be worth while now to try to get some idea of the present situation and to record recent events. A meeting of Tehran merchants on the 13th May passed a resolution protesting against the attitude of the Soviet Government and their commercial representatives towards Persia, and requesting the Persian Government to take energetic action to secure better treatment for Persian trade. A report of this meeting with a summary of the resolution, as published in the Iran of the 14th May, is attached. The attitude of the Persian Government, as recently described by a confidential informant, was one of complete loss of confidence in Soviet words and undertakings. During the absence on leave of the former Soviet Ambassador. Petrovsky, considerable progress was recorded in discussions between Yassai, head of the Persian Department of Commerce, and ShevtsofT, the Soviet commercial representative, and a draft agreement covering most of the points at issue was ready for signature. With the return of Petrovsky, however, matters again changed for the worse. Petrovsky is said to have demanded as a preliminary to any negotiations the cessation of the embargo and the abandon ment of the Persian plan to set up a centralised office to deal with all Perso- Soviet trade, together with other conditions considered to be incompatible with the dignity of the Persian Government. Yassai was dismissed from the Department of Commerce a few days ago, and Shevtsoff has gone on leave. It is rumoured that Yassai was removed as a result of Soviet complaints that he was not succeeding in settling the impasse, and that ShevtsofT has been recalled in order that fresh Mnds on both sides should be set to work on the problem. It is probable that a good deal of the opposition to Soviet trading methods voiced by Persian merchants in Tehran and the provinces is directly inspired by the Government,‘atid would quickly subside if the Persian Government were able to obtain satisfaction of some of its main grievances. A large unfavourable balance of trade with any particular country is a matter of concern to the Government rather than to individual merchants. Ihe difficulties of individual traders in Persia in dealing with a strong monopolistic body represented by the Soviet trading organisations are very much the same as those of individual traders in other countries, who find themselves compelled to sell at the lowest [831 u—7]2 prices to such a powerful customer, and to buy at prices arbitrarily fixed, especially in respect of articles the supply of which is a virtual Soviet monopoly. There is also, of course, the long-standing complaint that Persian products acquired by the Soviet buying concerns in Persia are subsequently dumped on foreign markets at ridiculous prices in the hunt for valuta, thus making legitimate Persian trade with those markets more difficult. Reports from Northern Persia show that trade is all too seriously affected Jk by the present dispute, and it is no doubt fully recognised by the Persian Govern ment that, short of changing its geographical position, there is no hope for real prosperity in that part of the country for a long time to come without normal trading relations with the Soviet Union. In view of such a situation, it must be admitted that Persia is making a most valiant effort to avoid complete domination by her powerful northern neighbour. This is particularly apparent in the efforts being made to reduce Persian dependence on the Soviet Union for supplies of sugar and textiles, as is shown by the recent orders to a Czech firm for six additional sugar factories, and to a British firm for machinery for several spinning mills. The eventual produce of these spinning mills will of course tend to exclude imports of textiles from other countries as well, but, at least, it will reduce Persia’s necessity to export raw cotton to the U.S.S.R. and subsequently import the finished product. In the meantime, Persian cotton is being exported in increasing quantities to India and Germany via the southern ports or the Indian land frontier. The question of alternative routes to Europe for Persian imports and exports is one which must be seriously occupying the Persian Government. Such incidents as the recent insistence of the Soviet Government on obtaining the whole order for rails for the Persian railway under threat of refusing to allow any to be delivered via U.S.S.R. for the northern section will no doubt not be allowed to recur indefinitely. In an article in the Iran on the 22nd May Rahnema, editor of that newspaper and a Deputy of the Majlis, said that Persia needed a free access to the sea in order to avoid Soviet vexatious restrictions which were crippling Persian commerce. He pointed out that prior to the Soviet regime Russian transit rates and regulations were comparatively stable, but were now subject to almost daily changes. Persia must find a route for its products subjected to ordinary international laws and customs and free from such constant vexations. His Majesty’s Minister has already reported, in his despatches Nos. 185 and 198 of the 22nd April, the closing down or reduction of staffs of Soviet consular or trading establishments in Persia, and this process continues. The following notes from reports received from Persian centres other than Tehran may be worthy of record :— Meshed .—The Soviet trading organisation closed their offices on the 6th April, and it was reported that the staff were preparing to leave for Russia. The Russian bank was doing no business at all. Some local merchants have circulated notices offering to sell their shares in the bank at 70 per cent, discount. The chamber of commerce warned traders that those dealing with Russians would be liable to be arrested and branded as traitors. A hwaz .—Orders were received in March from the Commerce Department in Tehran instructing merchants to cease transactions with the Soviet commercial representation. Kermanshah .—“ Russian stock here stands very low at the moment, the local traders not having a good word to say for the Russians and their methods.” The local Persazneft closed their office in April. Resht .—The embargo on all Soviet concerns continues, and picketing of their offices has again taken place (in May). A Persian broker was expelled from Resht for having entered a Soviet office. All goods arriving from Baku are refused permission to land. “It is believed here that the province cannot continue to pay high taxes to the Government and at the same time carry on the embargo with Russia.” Tabriz .—No Russian piece-goods arrived in April, but about sixty bales arrived from Trebizond. Supplies of sugar were arriving from Bagdad via Kermanshah and from Europe by the Rowanduz route, and merchants were arranging to send export produce by the latter route. All Soviet trading organisations were considerably reduced.3 Bushire .—Vneshtorg was closed in March and the staff transferred to Shiraz. It was rumoured that the Russian bank there would be closed shortly. A Soviet ship which arrived on the 31st March with 4,000 packages for Bushire was not allowed to discharge its cargo. SIDNEY SIMMONDS, Commercial Secretary. Tehran, June 3, 1933. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from Iran of May 14, 1933. Russo-Persian Trade : Statement of Tehran Merchants. AT a meeting of about forty merchants held yesterday, the unfair treatment of Persia’s trade by Soviet commercial institutions was a matter of long discussion. A statement was issued inviting the attention of the Government and requesting cancellation of the Commercial Agreement with Russia, or such amendments as will assure the interests of the country. The statement was on the following lines :— Previous to the war, half Persia’s trade was effected with Russia. After a short crisis during the war, Russo-Persian trade developed again on mutually satisfactory lines. Conditions have changed, owing to the unfair methods of trade adopted by Russia. The whole mechanism of trade is controlled by the Soviet Government, and Russian commercial officials, though badly needing Persian produce, withhold from buying until prices fall to a bare minimum. When selling their goods they do the reverse, so as to ruin Persia’s trade. If continued, Persian merchants and peasants will be ruined. The Persian Government has given exceptional facilities to Soviet commercial institutions. Sixty to 100 per cent, of many items in the quota of imports was allocated to Russia with the privilege of exporting Persian products against imports within eighteen months, and with exemption from exchange obligations. The Soviet commercial agency abused these facilities. It raised the price of Russian goods to exorbitant levels, under a pretext of a fall in silver. Instead of using the proceeds of imports to purchase Persian products, rial proceeds were exchanged into foreign currency, thereby creating instability in the exchange market. For the last six months U.S.S.R. institutions have bought no Persian products, and when they wished to purchase anything they offered the lowest prices and required long credit. No effective measures have been taken by Government to remedy this bad state of affairs. The U.S.S.R. agency continues to import into Persia, while Persian merchants are bound by the restrictions of the quota and the percentage appropriated to Russia and watch their business go to ruin. Russian imports exceed exports from Persia by millions, and we do not know when this deficiency will be made up. The Moscow authorities appear to have been misled by false misrepresenta tions from their commercial agency, which alone is responsible for the unsatisfactory condition of our mutual trade. It is, however, surprising that Moscow has not so far attempted to control the commercial agency. Government has been requested to take energetic remedial measures, other wise Persian merchants have no alternative but to restrict still further individual business with Russia and look for new markets abroad.09) INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote — no/ to any /erson by wnwr, bb to^^ ' ' Vj y CONFIDENTIAL :tary of State,” Foreign Office, Londli, S.W. • and address “The Under-Secretary (h/ c THE Under-Secretary ofj St^e^cV^ ^ rei^i Affairs presents his compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copvjLo of the under-mentioned paper.

WITH reference to my despatch No . 134 of the 2 5th March last, I have the honour to report that commercial relations between the Persian Government and the Soviet Union appear to be reaching breaking-point. 2. A special commission, including Farajullah Khan Bahraini (Dabir Azam), the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, and Yassai (whose position of head of the Department of Commerce is reported to be a little shaky), has been appointed to examine the whole question of Perso-Soviet trade. 3. Meanwhile delegates of Persian chambers of commerce have been convened to discuss the matter, and the Iran of the 18th April published a resolution passed by this commission urging the denunciation of the existing treaty with the Soviets and the conclusion of a new agreement under which Persian merchants could trade with the Soviets on an equal footing. A French translation of the resolution reproduced from the Messager de Teheran of the 19th April is enclosed herewith. 4. Negotiations are entirely suspended, and I have heard of no development indicating any desire on either side to reach a compromise. Indeed, so far as the Persian Government are concerned, it seems natural to regard the resolution of the chambers of commerce as evidence of an intention to denounce the treaty, in spite of the fact that it is valid for three years from the exchange of ratifications, which took place at Moscow in June 1932. 5. In the meantime business between the two countries is practically at a standstill. The Bazaar branch of the Russian Bank has been closed and the books transferred to the head office. The Soviet commercial representative is reported to have sent back to Baku 80 per cent, of his Tehran staff, and reports from Resht state that Soviet concerns there are reducing expenses and staff all round, and that 300 employees have, much against their wishes, been returned to Baku in the first fortnight of this month. 6. I have written a separate despatch on the reduction of Soviet consular staffs. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T.

Sir, Tehran, A'pril 22, 1933. ’ I HAVE the honour to report that on the 13th April the oriental secretary to this Legation had a conversation with Mirza Hamid Khan Sayyah, the head of the Russian section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Soviet- Persian relations. 2. Mirza Hamid Khan Sayyah immediately embarked on a long dissertation on the evils of the Bolshevik regime. He referred to the Moscow trial, and said that it showed how the Russians had to stage such trials to draw off attention from their own failures. 3. Mr. Trott asked how negotiations about the commercial impasse were proceeding. Sayyah said that no negotiations were at present in progress. It remained to be seen whether the new Ambassador (whose name he gave as Pastukhoff) would arrange a new treaty, or at any rate fulfil the old. 4. He knew that the Russians were reducing their staffs in various consulates. He could not give him details; the Protocol Department knew all about that. But he knew that what was wrong with the Russians now was their desperate lack of “valuta ” ; they had no spare money for use abroad. 5. On the 20th April Mr. Trott had the chance to revert to this matter with Mirza Farrukh Khan Braghon, the “chef du protocole,’’ who professed to have no idea when the new Soviet Ambassador was likely to arrive. 6. As for the closing of Soviet consulates in Persia, Farrukh Khan said that the only two which had been definitely closed were those of Maku and Muhammadabad (Sarakhs) on the northern frontier. In other posts such as Isfahan it was true that acting consular officers were in charge, but no post other than the two quoted had been closed. 7. Farrukh Khan confirmed the statement that the reason for economising was the lack of foreign exchange. The same difficulty was also causing the Persian Government to close some of its consulates in the Soviet Union. During the first part of the Soviet regime consular officers had been authorised to buy their requirements from the local co-operative. This was stopped a year or two ago, and now Persian consuls were obliged to pay in foreign exchange for their purchases at the Torgsin shops. Apart from that, in the old days the 200,000 Persians in Russia used more or less to maintain the Persian consular establishments in Russia. But now, all the remaining Persian nationals weie very poor and nothing could be extracted from them. The result was a serious budgetary problem for the Persian Government, who were gradually deciding to cut down their representation. . 8. Apart from the consulates referred to above the Soviet Government are represented at Ahwaz, Astarabad, bhiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Meshed, Resht, Tabriz and Pahlavi. There are also trading organisations at some other places, such as Bushire and Muhammerah. 9.

I have had no time before the departure of the courier to consider what the answers to the questions put by Mr. Lingeman in paragraph 27 of his memorandum should be. I shall try to furnish you with my observations by a later courier, although the whole problem is so involved that I doubt whether I shall be able to offer any constructive suggestions, but in the meantime I send you Mr. Lingeman’s swan-song, which gives a clear picture of the present situation and will, I am confident, prove invaluable in any further study of the question. 3. I am also enabled, by the courtesy of my United States colleague, to send you a copy of a note which he recently addressed to the Persian Government protesting pro forma against the discriminatory treatment accorded to Soviet trade with Persia under the commercial treaty of 1931. This note might possibly have brought out more fully the dual nature of the discrimination from which non-Soviet importers suffer, in that before any import licence can be obtained they are obliged to export Persian produce (or buy export certificates) to the value of the goods to be imported and also sell to the Government foreign exchange to the value of the produce exported (or alternatively buy—at an extra premium— “exchange sold ” export certificates): see paragraphs 12 and 13 of Mr. Linge man’s memorandum. 4. The head of the English section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs recently told Mr. Lingeman that he was a member of a commission that had been formed in the Ministry of Finance to consider modifications of the Monopoly Law, and would be grateful for “ideas.” Mr. Lingeman said that he would be glad to make suggestions, but must know certain basic principles, for example, was the quota system to be adhered to. and were export certificates to continue to be transferable, or to be non-transferable, or to be done away with altogether? 5. Jellal then revealed what was probably his main object in speaking to Mr. Lingeman. He enquired what good His Majesty’s Government derived from the conventionalised rates laid down in the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, so-called. Feroughi had told him (as he told me on one occasion, but there is no record of any thing of the kind in the Legation archives) that this treaty had been responsible for the introduction of the monopoly of foreign trade, my predecessor having paid no heed to the Persian Government’s warnings that if they could not restrict imports by raising their tariff dues they would have to find some other way of doing so. If only, Jellal added, Persia could secure tariff autonomy in reality, the trade monopoly, which had caused such a lot of harm, might perhaps be abolished. Mr. Lingeman pointed out that even without tariff autonomy the Persian Govern ment had already met the difficulty of swollen imports by issuing instructions to the Persian Customs to refuse admittance to certain classes of goods. 6. When Jellal insisted that he was anxious to know what advantages we saw in the present conventional tariff, Mr. Lingeman mentioned : (a) Reasonable duties on those imports which had not been prohibited. British trade was not fundamentally interested in the prohibited articles, which were mostly luxuries, while it would be a long time before local industry seriously competed with British [747 ee—7] Bimports of staple products (cottons, woollens, machinery); and (b) the elimination of the danger that the Persian Government, when it raised its tariff, might discriminate in favour of Soviet trade as the result of political or economic pressure on the part of the Soviet Government. Jellal protested that such discrimination was inconceivable, but had to admit the application of the^ favourable 1903 tariff to Soviet imports during the eight years the 1920 tariw had remained in force. To his naive enquiry, whether His Majesty s Government would not be satisfied with a formal assurance on the part of the Persian Govern ment that no such tariff discrimination would ever be allowed in future, Mr. Lingeman guardedly replied that he would go into the whole question of the revision of the Trade Monopoly Law and looked forward to the possibility of another friendly discussion with Jellal at some future date. His departure has, however, made any further discussion impossible. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 47), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 22). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum on the Amendments brought to the Application of the Trade Monopoly Law, as affecting the relative Position of Soviet and non-Soviet Importers, since February 1932. THE scheme which I submitted to the ex-Minister of Court on the 21st February, 1932, with a view to bring importers of our goods as far as possible into line with the Soviet trade organisations, is set out at the end of paragraph 1 of the enclosure to Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 96 of the 24th February. It will be remembered that I found Teymourtache in an execrable mood and that he would hear nothing of the Legation’s proposals ; but in subsequent conversations he gave signs of taking various of its component parts into serious consideration. 2. The aim of this memorandum is to estimate the value of the concessions that have since been made to our point of view and the harm that Persian innovations and backslidings have caused our interests, so as to arrive at a comparison of our present position with what it was just over a year ago. 3. The following questions in particular call for an answer : Have the Persian Government made any honest attempt to grant us the most-favoured nation treatment to which we are entitled by treaty, a claim which Teymourtache seemed inclined to treat with levity in connexion with his precious trade monopoly? How do we stand vis-a-vis the Soviets at the present moment in regard to the general subject of import restrictions? 4. The scheme referred to above was made up of six different items, but the last three are dependent on the third so that the first three only need be considered here. Quarterly Quotas. 5. These were introduced as from the beginning of the second economic year (opening on the 22nd June, 1932), a decree to this effect being passed at the end of April. In September, however, force was given to a decision of the Council of Ministers that applications for a twelfth of any given quota for the year would be considered at any time. This was tantamount to putting the quota system on an annual basis, and. be it noted, the only promise I was able to extract from the Minister of Court in February was that if the quotas could not be quarterly they would remain six-monthly. The change, naturally, tended to benefit large associations of importers, each individual member of which could .apply for one-twelfth of the annual quota, and there is little doubt that the idea was devised by Teymourtache with a view to assist the Iran Trading Corporation, which he had just founded. 6. Under the regulations which have been published during the last week, implementing the Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act of the 10th July, 1932, the3 quotas for the next economic year are to be half-yearly once more, applications in respect of each half-year being accepted during the whole of that half-year. No limit is placed on the comprehensiveness of the application, which is at present limited to one-twelfth as above; moreover, article 16 is followed by a note which accords to the Government the right to grant licences for certain merchandise .egardless of the six-monthly quotas—a reservation which, it seems to me. would enable them to grant import monopolies to applicants of their choice without further ado. Rapid Issue of Import Licences. 7. In asking that licences should be issued within a week we were probably asking the impossible, our aim being to put the Persians on their metal. The decree, signed at the end of April of last year, introducing quarterly quotas, fixed four periods during which applications for the following quarter would be entertained, the licences being issued within twenty days of the expiry of each period. This speeded up matters considerably, and gave satisfaction to that extent to importers of our goods. From September last applications could be put in at any time, while the import licences were issued with, on the whole, commendable swiftness. 8. The latest regulations stipulate that licences must be issued l ' without delay,” which is a little vague, but the creation of commissions in each customs post (articles 1 and 16), on which will devolve the task of allotting licences within the quotas assigned to each post, should make for the acceleration of the issuing machinery. What abuses this change may lead to, which have not already manifested themselves in the central organisation, it is too early as yet to anticipate. The proposed Bank Guarantees. 9. We put forward this suggestion not so much out of practical considera tions—as the great bulk of importers would in any case prefer to purchase their export certificates outright so as to know exactly where they stood—as with a view to press the principle that importers of British goods could not be denied facilities which were very definitely granted the Soviets. We suggested a fine of 20 or 25 per cent, in case the export certificates were not produced within six months—the restraining effect of which should have been wholly adequate and stipulated, so as completely to safeguard the principle of the trade balance, that the imports would in no event be allowed through the Customs until these certificates were actually forthcoming. Teymourtache at first opined that the banks should be called upon to guarantee the production of the certificates, but that being out of the question, he finally asserted that nothing less than a bank guarantee covering 100 per cent, of the value of the imports would satisfy him, so that the Government should be able to effect the required export themselves in the event of the importer failing to honour his undertaking to do so. 10. Smuggling, under-valuation of imports and over-valuation of exports having stultified the efforts of the Government to arrive at a true balance of trade, it was laid down in the Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act of July 1932 that, henceforth, applications for import licences would only be accepted if supported by export certificates, “ of which the exchange undertaking has been fulfilled. The significance of this innovation is discussed below. What we are concerned with here is the alternative, which the same law offered importers, to produce a bank guarantee to the effect that a certificate would be produced within six months merely showing that the required amount of exchange had been sold to the bank by the applicant—not the dual certificate, so to speak, proving at the same time that Persian products to the value of the contemplated imports had been exported. This offered an advantage which was certainly unpremeditated, and in the absence of explanatory regulations the system was never put into practice. 11. Article 21 of the regulations, now published, stipulates that import licences may be issued against undertakings to export guaranteed by one of the “solvent banks,” which was Teymourtache’s original suggestion to me (see paragraph 9). As was obvious from the first, the Imperial Bank of Persia state that they cannot give such guarantees. , [747 ee—7] b 2I nao cations. 12. Two innovations have occurred since our representations of February 1932, which are harmful to our interests while leaving the Soviets unscathed, both being contained in the Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act of July last. 13. Until this Act came into force applicants for import licences coul^jp*- attach to their application forms one of the two types of export certificates— ^ exchange sold ” or “exchange unsold.” The former commanded a premium of 8 per cent., because the purchaser did not have to assume, as he did in the case of “ exchange unsold ” certificates, the responsibility of selling exchange to the face value of the certificates to the authorised banks at the official rate, in the event of an equivalent import not being effected within eight months of the issue of the certificate. Since July “ exchange sold ” certificates have been insisted on for all importers other than the Soviets, the theory being that, in future, imports could only be paid for out of the proceeds of the sales of Persian products abroad. In practice, the exporter, if he is also an importer, cannot afford to wait until he sells his exports (particularly in the present condition of world markets) to import foreign goods to the same value. He will either give up the idea of importing, in which case he will sell his export certificate at once “ exchange unsold,” which will bring him about 10 per cent., or join the ranks of the ordinary importer. The latter will buy either an export certificate, “ exchange sold,” or an export certificate, “ exchange unsold,” in which case he will have to produce, with his application for an import licence, a bank certificate showing that he has already sold the required amount of “ exporters’ exchange.” Although the law stipulates that exchange bought on the Persian market will not be accepted by the banks as such, in the great majority of cases it actually is bought on the market, remitted abroad, telegraphed back to the local bank, which buys it as “ exporters’ exchange,” although it knows perfectly well that it is not. The operation, however, costs the importer the difference between the selling rate for free exchange at which he bought (either from a bank or in the bazaar) and the rate for “ exporters’ exchange ” at which the bank buys his remittance from abroad. The difference between the two rates is the same as the difference in the cost of export certificates “ exchange sold ” and “ exchange unsold,” i.e., 8 per cent., as above. 14. Innovation No. 2 has also added in theory to the cost of export certificates. According to article 8 (c) of the Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act, import licences can only be issued to the value of 95 per cent, of the export certificates submitted to the Department of Commerce by the would be importer, the balance—representing in theory 5 per cent, of the foreign exchange derived from the country’s total exports other than those to Soviet Russia—being earmarked for Government requirements. 15. It would seem at first sight as if importers of non-Soviet goods from July 1932 onwards had been saddled with the full burden of these two extra charges, i.e., 8 per cent, and 5 per cent, (or to be exact 5-263 per cent.). In actual fact they made hardly any impression on the price of “ exchange sold ” export certificates. A separate note on this subject is attached. 16. The new charges, in practice, have but accentuated a process which was already very evident and which can be summarised as follows: Misguided Govern ment attempts to mitigate the effects of the world depression and escape from the Soviet stranglehold; increasing restrictions on trade, increasing taxes and over head charges generally; increasing difficulty on the trader’s part to finance his business; decreasing income and lower capacity on the consumer’s part to pay the prices demanded of him; greater dependence on Soviet imports on both the merchant’s and the consumer’s part, thus completing the vicious circle. Conclusions. 17. The quotas from half-yearly became quarterly, then yearly, and are now on a half-yearly basis once more. In view of the likelihood that every attempt will be made to issue the licences as rapidly as possible, that should suit importers of our goods well enough. Attention has been drawn to the opening which appears to have been specially made for associations of merchants—the Iron Trading Corporation first and foremost—aiming at import monopolies. But all is fair in love and war, and that is no reason in itself why British interests should be adversely affected.5 4 18. The entirely futile system of bank guarantees has presumably, one can almost say undoubtedly, been introduced as the result of our representations of February 1932. It gives us designedly the shadow of a concession instead of the substance. (Are we to exclaim “ 1’honneur est sauf,” or to express resentment at what might be put down as a blatant attempt to make fools of us ?) 19. We have to complain of two innovations harmful to our trade in so far that they make for greater dependence on the Soviets. 20. Answers can now be supplied to the questions that were asked in paragraph 3. 21. Where the import quotas are concerned the Persian Government have followed the course set by their own fancy and indecision, but primarily by the strong vested interests (with a decidedly monopolistic tendency) which have influenced the Minister of Court and the Department of Commerce from the first. 22. Steps have been taken to accelerate the issue of import licences, because Persian commercial interests as a whole demanded such action. 23. The Persian Government have tacitly recognised our claim to most favoured-nation treatment in the matter of bank guarantees in typically Persian fashion. They turned down a scheme which it was perfectly possible for them to accept without the slightest damage to their trade policy—merely, perhaps, for reasons of amour-propre —and substituted an alternative system which can but remain a dead letter. 24. The major amendments to the Trade Monopoly Law, i.e., the two innovations described above, have helped to drive both the Persian merchant and the Persian consumer into the arms of the Soviets, but that is merely an unexpected consequence of the pathetic struggles of the Persian Government to free themselves from the Soviet embrace, the obvious simile being that of a man in a bog whose struggles merely result in his sinking deeper and deeper. On the other hand, one must not exaggerate the effect of these changes. The Persian merchant adapts himself very quickly to a new situation, some means being found to evade the latest ukase of the Department of Commerce. The Soviets also have had their own differences of opinion with the Persian Government, and Soviet trade with Persia can hardly be said to have prospered in 1932. 25. It must also be remembered that the special facilities granted to the Soviets are almost entirely due to their geographical position and the state of their national economy, which have naturally made of Russia, a large purchaser of Persian products. The value of Soviet imports into Persia, in theory at all events, is now limited to the value of Soviet exports from this country. It is very largely because these exports have been very much restricted in recent years that the two parties have fallen out. The Persian Government show no signs of wishing to grant the Soviets exceptional trade facilities except for services rendered. Their attitude is a perfectly logical one. 26. Our complaint has always been and can only be that the Persian Government, in view of our unassailable claim to most-favoured-nation treatment, do not make a sincere enough attempt to give importers of our goods—and of all other goods by the same token—as fair a chance as the Government can contrive to compete with the Soviet trade organisations. 27. What are we to do under the circumstances ? Should we, so late in the day, make another attempt to put matters ri^ht—waiting still longer perhaps until a suitable opportunity occurs of overhauling Anglo-Persian relations afresh—or should we content ourselves at the moment with a pro forma protest soothing to our own amour-propre, in that we could make it plain to the Persians that we have not been their dupes, and almost certainly useful at some future date as a record of our disapproval*? E. R. LINGEMAN. Tehran, March 8, 1933. YS—Reference paragraph 12 (p. 5, penultimate paragraph).—To avoid telegraphic expenses, the following system has recently been introduced : A man comes to a bank and asks for free exchange. He is told he can have as much as he cares for “within his limit.” He buys, say, £1,000, and is issued with a draft, on Bagdad, for instance. He then makes out that he wishes to sell £1.000 exporters’ exchange and draws a bill to that value on some Bagdad agent. As security he offers the draft he has just bought from the bank, and the latter pins the draft to the bill, which is sent to Bagdad for collection, but which is, ofMHH 6 course, met by the accompanying draft. The bank issues a certificate to the effect that it has bought a £1,000 worth of £ ‘exporter’s exchange’ from this particular client. Reference yaragra'ph 18.—The Imperial Bank of Persia recently sent a representative to the Department of Commerce to enquire how the new system of^, bank guarantees was intended to operate. He was told by the head of the 1 rad&lt; Monopoly Department, who hinted very broadly that the system had been purposely devised so that it should not be put into practice, that the bank itself would have to apply for the import licence, which would be^ issued in its name against the bank’s undertaking to submit export certificates “ exchange sold to the same value within six months of the date of the issue of the licence. Apart from which import licences are not transferable. 1 E. R. L. Appendix. Prices of Exchange Sold Certificates of Export in 1932. January 3rd, 21 per cent.; 31st, 20 per cent.

The only difference was that, at the beginning of August, the rate only reacted to 24^ per cent, from 12^ per cent, immediately after the passage of the new law—the lowest point reached during the year—while it reached 26^ per cent, in March, and even 30 per cent, for a few days. One would have expected a rise in price from July onwards as the result of the added difficulty of finding ‘ ‘ exchange sold ' ’ export certificates, but the new law helped to frighten off potential purchasers and therefore to depress prices. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. United States Minister to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Highness, Tehran, January 5, 1933. I AM instructed by my Government to refer once again to the subject of the Perso-Soviet Convention of the 27th October, 1931, and its effect on American trade with Persia, and, in particular, to the views of the American Government on this matter as set forth in a memorandum presented to the Under-Secretary7 o of State for Foreign Affairs on the 14th April last. To date, no reply has been received from the Persian Government, either to the memorandum in question or to the Legation’s oral representations on the subject. The Government of the United States has taken cognisance of the fact ^hat, with the exchange of ratifications on the 22nd June, 1932, the Perso-Soviet Jonvention has now fully come into force. As the Persian Government has previously been informed, my Government considers that the most-favoured nation clause of the Provisional Agreement of the 14th May, 1928, between the United States and Persia entitles American trade with Persia to privileges equivalent to those accruing to Soviet trade under the Perso-Soviet Convention, and, in my Government’s judgment, it does not appear that such privileges are accorded to American trade under any of the provisions of the present trade monopoly regulations of Persia. In particular, after a careful examination of the recently amended foreign trade monopoly law, my Government is of the opinion that the so-called bank guarantee plan incorporated in article 8 (/) (2) of that law fails to afford American trade with Persia, if such was its intent, facilities equivalent to those granted to Russian trade under the terms of the Perso-Soviet Convention. From the standpoint of the American exporter, my Government finds especially burdensome the two essential requirements conditioning the issue of import permits under the Persian trade monopoly law, which Soviet importers in Persia are not required to fulfil, and which therefore appear to be of a nature discriminatory against American trade with Persia : namely, the requirement to export Persian goods before importing an equivalent amount of foreign goods; and the requirement to sell to the Persian Government foreign exchange to the value of such exports. Furthermore, it appears that, under the newly amended trade monopoly law, an importer not wishing to avail himself of the bank guarantee plan, may import goods only up to 95 per cent, of the value of his export certificate, a stipulation not applied in the case of Soviet trade, and therefore also discriminatory in fact against American trade with Persia. In addition, mention may be made of the flexibility enjoyed by Soviet commerce in the matter of balancing exports against imports, in contrast to the provisions of article 8 (/) (2) above referred to, under which importers of American goods must effect such a balance within six months, not from the date of actual importation, but from the date of receiving an import permit. My Government desires me to reiterate at this time its view that the monopolisation and percentage allotment of import quotas in favour of Soviet trade is incompatible with the most-favoured-nation principle, and that, to the extent that this practice results in an adverse effect on American trade, it regards such monopolisation and percentage allotment of quotas as constituting additional discrimination against American trade with Persia. I am instructed to add that an early expression of the Persian Government’s views in the above matters would be appreciated. Accept, &amp;c. CHARLES C.

WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 53 and 54 of the 14th and the 16th March respectively, I have the honour to report that His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz has since telegraphed that the Soviet organisations there will probably be reduced to a mere cadre by the 25th March. I have not received news of any similar situation arising either at Meshed or Resht. 2. Despatches since received from Mr. Palmer furnish more details of the local situation and the anxiety felt by merchants who have sold goods on credit to the Soviet trade organisations. It is feared that the merchants may either lose their money or at best be offered the return of the goods. It may safely be pre sumed that such trade debts all over the country represent a considerable sum, as there must be a great many long-term bonds—anything up to twelve months— falling due in the near future. The sum of 15 million rials is mentioned as the approximate total due to the Persians. If this is the case, it constitutes a formid able lever in the hands of the Soviets in their negotiations with the Persian Government. 3. I have no information as to when M. Petrovsky’s successor will arrive, or whether an Ambassador will be sent before the settlement of the present trade dispute. 4. In this connexion Mr. Palmer reports that the Soviet consul-general at Tabriz, M. Sitchew, had intimated to his Turkish colleague that he quite expected to be recalled to Moscow in May, mentioning M. Petroff, the present incumbent of Resht, as his probable successor. He considered that the Resht consulate would be closed and only the Pahlavi post retained. Changes are also apparently impending in the consular representation at Shiraz and Isfahan. 5.

IN my despatch No. 338 of the 29th July, 1932, I had the honour to transmit to you an English translation of the Foreign Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act of the 10th July, 1932. 2. The regulations for the application of this iVct have just been published in the local press, and a French translation taken from the Messager de Teheran of the 24th and 26th February is attached. 3. These regulations give detailed instructions to the authorised banks as to the procedure to be followed as regards operations in exporters’ exchange and the keeping of accounts relating thereto. 4. An effort to speed up the issue of import licences is evident. Article 1 provides for the formation at such points of entry as the Department of Commerce may deem suitable of a Foreign Trade Monopoly Commission, comprising a representative of the Department of Commerce and the Director of Customs or his representative. The commission will have to assess the value of imports and exports should there be a difference of opinion between the importer, or exporter, and the Customs. It will also receive engagements for sales of exchange and issue export certificates, and, finally, issue import licences. These licences, in accordance with article 16, are to be issued without delay. They were previously only issued at the Licence Issuing Office in Tehran. 5. Articles 3 to 8 amplify article 6 (g) of the Act regarding the valuation of exports, and export certificates. 6. Articles 16 to 23 amplify article 8 of the Act (see paragraph (g) of article 8). Import quotas for the next economic year, beginning on the 22nd June, 1933, will be divided into two six-monthly portions, for which applications may be submitted during the relative six months : there will, there fore, be no close season for the issue of import licences. No mention is made of any restrictions as to the proportion of the quotas that may be applied for; moreover, note 2 to article 16 makes it possible, with special Government permis sion, to obtain import licences for certain goods irrespective of the six-monthly quota. In other words, it seems likely that the Iran Trading Corporation, for instance, or any other institution, may apply for and obtain licences for the import of a whole yearly quota, which is tantamount to the granting of a monopoly. 7. Article 21 appears to be an abortive attempt to correct the second paragraph of paragraph (/) of article 8 of the Act regarding the issue of import licences under bank guarantees, which was never operative. The new regulation states that import licences may be issued against export undertakings on the part of one of the “solvent banks.” It looks as if this proviso is included merely to show willingness to fall in with the Legation’s representations in the spring of last year, whilst making it practically impossible for the banks to comply. The Imperial Bank of Persia state that they are not interested, as they do not intend to give any such guarantees except in very exceptional cases. 8. Article 27 gives instructions regarding the valuation of imports in accordance with article 9 of the Act, that is to say, invoices are not accepted as final, and the goods are valued on the wholesale price ruling at the port of entry. A note to this article states, however, that the value of machines and chemicals, for which there is no wholesale market in the interior, may be estimated on the basis of the invoice or other documents accepted by the Customs and equal to the c.i.f. price. 9. Article 28 of these regulations amends article 19 of the Customs “Reglement” of the 26th May, 1928, which lays down that in the case of imported goods being pre-empted by the Customs following a disagreement as to [747 ee—5] p 33I(50S THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

WITH reference to my telegram No, 45 of yesterday, I have the honour to inform you that I learnt a Fewdavs^agoT~from the source which I quoted in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 60 of the 10th instant, that the Soviet ^ Ambassador had intimated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 13th that the instructions he had received from Litvinov were not only to refuse to discuss the Persian proposal to centralise Perso-Soviet trade but also to decline to discuss aq^feher question unless the Imperial Government abandoned this proposal once an^^* all. As this constituted the main Persian desideratum, Feroughi, who must have been prepared for something of the sort, appears to have replied that the Persian Government could not with dignity agree to negotiate on these terms and would prefer to shelve the discussion of this and all other outstanding questions until the Soviet Government showed a more accommodating spirit. In fact the Persian Government hoped that M. Petrovski’s successor would prove more conciliatory than he had himself. Feroughi, however, was severely told that the Persian Government need harbour no such illusions; the conditions which Moscow would dictate might be expected to stiffen rather than weaken in future. 2. Where differences of opinion, other than purely commercial exchanges, are concerned mv informant mentioned : — (i) The Caspian Fisheries, the Soviets refusing to pay the dollar amounts due to the Persian Government, although the latter have agreed to a reduction. The Persians declined to accept roubles or materials for the railway, such as sleepers and rails. They needed the revenue from the fisheries for their general budget while the railway had a budget of its own. According to the same source the Persian Government claim that the Soviets owe them 500,000 tomans altogether, whereas the Soviet counter-claim cannot amount to more than 200,000 tomans of which 60.000 tomans for the transport of machinery for the Kerej sugar factory across the Caucasus. (ii) Conditions of transit by way of Batum and Baku remain very unsatis factory. Transport rates are too high, and delays, which often seem intentional, are very apt to occur. (iii) Although the treaty of October 1931 recognised the Caspian as a Perso- Soviet sea. the Soviet Government have so far done nothing to implement their undertaking to supply the Persian Government with a patrol vessel. (iv) The Aras (Azerbaijan) and Khurasan frontiers remain undefined, as well as the sovereignty of certain islands in the Caspian, although the Persian Government have been pressing for settlement. 3. The Czechoslovakian Charge d'Affaires, who stated that he had seen the Soviet Ambassador shortly after his interview with Feroughi, confirmed in conversation with the commercial secretary the above report of what had been said in the matter of the commercial relations between the two parties. He also quoted what M. Petrovski had told him was the only condition on which the Soviet I Government would agree to the Persian centralisation of Perso-Soviet trade; I namely, that Persian trade with all other countries should be similarly centralised • and so far there has been no indication that the Persian Government contemplate j this step. 4. I thereupon addressed to you mv telegram No. 45 of the 23rd February. [747 o—2]2 5. The news that the Iran Trading Corporation have been promised the monopoly of the import of sugar from May next was recently given to a Bagdad commission agent by the manager of the corporation. If true it signifies not only that the Persian Government will not renew its present sugar agreement with the Soviet Government, but that the corporation will be at liberty to import from the most economical source. 6. The next most important article of import from Soviet Russia, as laid down in the commercial treaty, is cotton piece-goods (24 million rials) per annum, or, say, €240,000, and here I have the Imperial Bank of Persia to thank for the information that the corporation have telegraphed to the Japanese firm of Mitsubishi offering to buy 4 million dollars' worth of Japanese piece-goods from them in exchange for 3 million dollars’ worth of raw cotton (of which there have been satisfactory trial shipments to Japan of late). 500,000 dollars' worth of opium and the remaining 500,000 dollars in any other Persian products the Japanese firm might care to take. One imagines that this deal is intended to cover at least two years, in view of the fact that the total annual quota for cotton piece-goods at present is only £450.000. 7. The commercial secretary has furnished the Department of Overseas Trade with various trade reports on the subject of the increasing sale in this country of Japanese cotton piece-goods, prints in particular. 8. The purchase of sugar and cotton goods and the disposal of Persian cotton outside Soviet Russia being thus provided for, at any rate in theory, there remained the important question of rice, in respect of which Dr. Friedlieb has has made a sensational offer. On this point the commercial secretary is reporting in a separate despatch. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. ifi). I have, &amp;c. R. H.

Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 27.) (No. 90.) Sir, Tehran, February 10. 1933. I HAVE the honour to inform you that more recent information throws a good deal of doubt on the most satisfactory^nature of the interview which took place between the Persian and Soviet delegates on the 3rd January, to discuss the situation arising out of the boycott and picketing of the Soviet trading and transport organisations in Gilan, as reported in paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 11 of the 12th January last,. While the boycott remains in force—it has in fact been extended to all or most other provinces—the picketing to which the Soviets, quite understandably, objected most strongly is a thing of the past. The Shah's rice has also been shipped to Baku, which has inspired an optimism in the individual rice grower and merchant which may well prove unwarranted. But it seems very unlikely than any intimation has been given to the Persian Govern ment of the Soviet Government's readiness to contract for the purchase of stipulated quantities of staple Persian products ahead. The Persian authorities' attitude appears to be one of nervous apprehension in regard to the outcome of their eventual negotiations. 2. Neither do the Persian Government give signs of having abandoned their idea of entrusting all commercial dealings with the Soviets to one central organisation. They should rather be suspected, with the approaching return of the Soviet Ambassador in mind, of having fostered the agitation which Persian merchants have been conducting in favour of the policy of centralising trade with Soviet Russia in an increasing volume of resolutions, open letters to the Prime Minister and complaints voiced in the press of the Government's inaction. 3. The attached account of a statement which is alleged to have been made by the Prime Minister to a local carpet dealer with whom he appears to be on terms of friendly indiscretion, and communicated by the latter to the commercial secretary, is interesting. It begins by giving in a succinct form the well-known Persian objection, or one of the main objections, to direct transactions between the Soviet trading organisations and individual Persians or Persian firms: the fear of propaganda, and goes on to deal with the danger of granting the Soviets credits i against their purchases of Persian products (all the more that they will only sell I against cash) in view of the possible collapse of the Bolshevik regime. 4. It is interesting to note that, according to this document, the official Persian view is that the Soviets—whatever their sins may be—can be relied upon to meet their bills. Various reports from His Majesty's consular officers in the provinces, which I hope to transmit to you in the near future, will be found, I think, to bear out the views expressed in my despatch No. 507 of the 2nd December last on this subject. 5. M. Petrovski, the Soviet Ambassador, has already arrived at Resht. I understand that he will not stay long, having already been appointed to Vienna. He is believed to have been given full powers to negotiate a commercial modus vivendi, to take the form of amendments to the Commercial Treaty of October 1931, presumably, but the Soviet Government are said to harbour little hope of its realisation in view of the “unreasonable demands' of the Persian Government and to propose to leave M. Zuckermann as Charge d'Affaires as long as the conflict lasts. In the meantime, one expects the Soviet Government to resort to their usual method of bringing the Persian Government to their senses, which consists in refraining from buying Persian produce. 6. The commercial secretary learns from an independent source, as a corollary to the above, that the Shah has instructed the Director of the Depart ment of Commerce to concentrate on the need to find alternative markets for Persian exports to the Russian, whether through an agreement with Dr. Friedlieb {which, one gathers, is to exclude import monopolies) or any other means.

I understand that the F.O. are asking Tehran to furnish a review of the general political reactions of Soviet commercial activities in Persia. Meanwhile an attempt _ x has been made in the attached note to give a very brief description of the trade monopoly regime m Persia and of the advantages which in conjunction with the Perso-Soviet Treaty of I 93 I -32 it appears to give to the Russians, but even without these advantages it is clear that the Russians were already in a very strong position to disorganise the Persian market^ an unscrupulous use of the power given to them by their geographical situation and the organisation of their trade in/in big state monopolies. It is also clear that from the purely commercial point of view Perso-Soviet trade is of much more import ance to Persia than to Russia, sime the Persian market is of relatively small value as compared with the total exports markets of the Soviet Govt . The papers now submitted are copies of papers in the E. &amp; 0. Dept., but that dept, has agreed that when these papers are of political interest they should be submitted by the Pol. Dept. The opposition fostered by the late Minister of Court against Soviet trade methods has been continued, and there has been a regular boycott of Russian goals in Gilan and an attempt to centralise and control commercial trajaJactions with the Soviets under the Iran Trading Corporation. Prom Mr. Hoare’s telegram of 23rd Peb., it will be seen that the Soviets have threatened to stop purchasing Persian products altogether, unless the Persians aoandon the idea of centralising their trade with Russia or apply the same principle to trade in general. j..ieanwhile the Perso-Soviet Treaty appears to be more or less in abeyance pending negotiations. The memorandum by the Commercial Secretary enclosed with Tehran despatch of 12th Jan. (P.Z.1237/33) is of considerable infc erest as it shows the conflicting figures of the Persians and the Soviets in regard to the balance o± trade. Both ciaim an 'adverse' balance against themselves and Mr. Lingeman has no idea which of the sets of.figures is the less unreliable. Mr. Parrer (D.° .T. ) ii^d.o. letter to the P.0, of 14 th Oct., (Plag j) accepted the Russian figures.inveigled into the comercial treaty of 1932, which gives Soviet trade a privileged position; the unscrupulous use which the Soviet makes of this position is well summarised on pp. 5-6 of I/r. Crombie f s memo. The only satisfactory feature m the situation is that, especially since the fall of Taimourtache, the Persia Govt, seem more than ever determined to attempt f rse to themselves from the meshes in which they have been entangled. We nay perhaps hope that they will take y&gt;v« a ^ steps to their treaty with the Soviet.

No. 1 . I IS ^ ^ i [E 611/21/34 j Mr. Hour? to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 31.) (No. 11.) Sir, Tehran, January 12, 1933. WITH reference to ray telegram No. 2 of the 6th instant, 1 have the honour to inform you that on the 22nd December the merchants of Gilan enforced a regular boycott of the Russian trading organisations, pushing their truculence so far as to picket the latter’s offices and prevent—not without a few broken heads— all access to their offices. The lorries of Bureau Perse were apparently allowed neither to leave their garage nor to enter it, the drivers being forced to dump in the roadway the goods they had brought from the interior. The methods employed were, it seems, after the best Hindu passive resistance precedents, men lying down in front of the lorries so as to make it impossible for them to move. 2. This boycott was undoubtedly the culmination of the efforts which the late Minister of Court made throughout the summer to persuade Persian merchants in general that it would be to their advantage in the long run to show a united front against Soviet Russia’s trade methods, which were as calamitous to the individual merchant as they were insulting to the dignity of the State. The members of the Iran Trading Corporation were egged on by the promise that all commercial transactions with Soviet Russia would be centralised in their hands should the movement prove successful. The Director of the Department of Commerce spent the week ending the 17th December in Gilan. and he was reported at the time to have advised the merchants to have no individual dealings with the Russians. It is almost certain that he gave the final touch to the plans for the boycott previously laid by Teymourtache (I hear in this connexion Yassai received a most violently worded letter from the Russian trade representative two days ago protesting against his recent activities in Gilan and laying the organisation of the boycott at his door—to which Yassai has perforce given the lie.) It is also rumoured that the police of Gilan provided some of the pickets mentioned above on the instructions of the Tehran police headquarters; while the local Governor, Divanbegi, a creature of Teymourtache, is said to have shown himself rabidly anti-Russian. He has since been recalled to Tehran, but I am unaware whether for consultation or as a sacrifice to Russian wrath. 3. According to a source which should be reliable, the Russian reaction took the form of three ultimata, which were delivered on the 1st January :— (a) The agent of the Russian trade representative in Gilan was ordered to inform the Governor that if the boycott was not called off before the 5th January all Russian trade organisations in Gilan would be closed forthwith and the personnel sent back to Russia. (b) Yassai was informed that all Russian purchases would cease if the boy cott continued. (c) The chief of the Tehran Municipality, who is also Comptroller-General to the Shah, was informed that in view of the transport difficulties resulting from the boycott there would be no ship available to transport the rice which the Russians had hitherto agreed to buy from His Majesty—one understands the whole of his substantial crop, while no other Persian rice of this year’s output has been bought in Gilan or Mazanderan up to now, to the intense distress of these two provinces. 4. The third ultimatum, if it can be called that, was withdrawn at the last moment “ so as not to embitter the conflict.” the Russians realising perfectly well that the threat would already have produced its effect. 5. The boycott, it will be noted, took place in spite of the Minister of Court’s dismissal—probably because nobody had thought of altering or delaying [691 hh—6]the execution of orders already given—but his absence must have been keenly felt when the Council of Ministers met on the 'ind January m the presence ol the Shah to discuss the situation. , , . , . • 6. It was finally agreed, according to my informant that instructions should be telegraphed to local Governors to take no part in the boycott, the oltieia attitude of the Government being a neutral one, and at the same time (one imagines) to exert a restraining influence on the merchants, t eroughi and Yassai were also detailed to interview the Russian trade representative, showing themselves conciliatory, but to give ground slowly in an endeavour to save t e Persian Government's prestige and obtain all possible concessions. lh ls P° was, very possibly, laid down by Teymourtache, who must have foreseen the result of the boycott he advocated with a view to bringing matters to a head. The shadow of the Minister of Court still hangs over the Cabinet. 7. A report which reached the Legation subsequently was to the effect that this interview, which took place on the 3rd January, proved most satisfactory, the Persians telegraphing to Resht to put an end to the boycott in its active and aggressive form—although the merchants are presumably still expected to retrain from dealing with the Russians individually -while the latter wiied instiactions to Baku to send a boat to pick up the Shah’s rice! It is also rumoured that the main Persian desideratum has already been secured : the Russians having agieec to guarantee an annual purchase of certain minimum quantities of Peisian nee, cotton and dried fruits at stipulated prices. Nothing, however, is said of the Russian willingness to abstain from buying the other Persian products which they have formed the habit of marketing outside Russia. 8. The Persian idea that a clearing-house—to be organised perhaps by the National Bank—should be formed to handle all Russo-Persian trade exchanges has also been the subject of discussion, but it seems that the Russian trade representative has raised certain practical objections which the Persian autho rities themselves recognise as cogent. The latter, in any case, are very hopeful 'that a new agreement will be reached with the Russians be tore the end of January. What part the Iran Trading Corporation will play in it, if any, it is impossible at this stage to predict. 9. I attach a note by the commercial secretary which deals with the conflict ing Persian and Russian views of the trade balance between the two countries. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.f (B) 4). the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 6), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 3). I have, &amp;c. R R HO ART. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting Rmso-Pcrsian Trade Differences. (Confidential.) I HEAR from a confidential and reliable source that the Russians, a few days prior to the Minister of Court’s dismissal on the 24th December, were given import licences to the substantial value of 70 million rials (say, €700,000). This seemed surprising in view of the declaration made to me by the Director of the Department of Commerce on my return from leave (my memorandum of the 17th November forwarded to the Foreign Office under Planted Letter No. 491, paragraph 5) that the Russians would obtain no more licences until they had settled outstanding accounts, and the more so when the news came in of the boycott of Russian commercial organisations in Gilan, which set in on the 22nd December. One can only assume that this boycott being intended to secure certain concessions from the Russians, the Persians wished to emphasise the fact that they could be pleasant in other directions when they felt so inclined. These import licences were applied mainly to prints, voiles and muslins (quota No. 15), cotton thread, leather, drugs, oil paints, candles, glassware, paper, eardboard, galoshes and linoleum—thereby exhausting the quotas in respect of these commodities set aside for the Russians.3 1 am also told that the latter up to date have taken up 78 per cent, of their quotas for cement, iron, chemicals and machinery, and 30 per cent, of all other quotas assigned to them. On the aggregate they have taken up no more than 56 per cent, of their 51 1 per cent, share of the import quotas for the whole country from all sources, of which they have themselves dealt with 52 per cent., leaving ^the remaining 4 per cent, to Persian merchants. As reported in my memorandum of the 17th November, commercial exchanges between the two countries from the introduction of the trade monopoly (the 27th February, 1931) to the 22nd September, 1932—nineteen months in all- resulted, according to the Persian figures, in an adverse balance to Persia of 25-6 million rials. During the next two months this adverse balance increased to 33-3 million rials (£333,000), to which the first five months of the current economic year (June-November 1932) contributed over half : 17 -5 million rials. The Persian Government have recently decided, it appears, to put aside for the moment the difference of 15-16 million rials incurred before June 1932 and to give the Russians until June 1933 to clear up the alleged deficit of 17^ million rials incurred since June 1932. failing which they will receive no more import licences this year. It is very improbable that the Russians will adjust the trade balance on the basis of these purely Persian figures, so that Soviet Russia, if the Persian Govern ment adhere to their latest decision, would import din ing the current year no more than 56 per cent, of the quotas earmarked for them. According to article 10 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of Commerce (see last two paragraphs of section 1) it is only in the event of the Russians applying for a reduction in their quotas before the end of the first half-year—which they have not done, as far as we know—that the surplus can be made available for other importers, excepting sugar and matches, of course, which come under special agreements. Failing such advice the Persian authorities would obviously not be able to gauge until the very end of the economic year the surplus available for outside distribution, but it might be added to the non-Russian quotas already decided upon for the following year. This is, however, very improbable in practice and the state of trade is so bad that it would probably not be wanted in any case. It is interesting to compare the official Soviet statistics for the trade of the Union with Persia, as quoted in the enclosure to Moscow despatch No. 649 of the 16th November, with the Persian figures in our possession. According to the former, the first eight months of 1932 resulted in a balance favourable to Persia amounting to 24,502,000 roubles, Russian exports to Persia having decreased by 19-7 per cent., while Persian imports into Soviet Russia were 34 5 per cent, higher. I have no idea which of the two sets of figures is likely to be the less unreliable. E. R. L. Tehran, January 12, 1933.No. 2. D. 9 0 15 p.m. January 6th, 1933. R. 9.30 a.m. January 7th, 1933. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Opposition fostered by Teyrnourtacho against Soviet trade methods has recently taken the form in Gilan of picketing latter’s offices to prevent individual operations. This development has almost certainly been inspired by the Government. It is significant that director of Department of Commerce recently visited Resht wherothe Governor is reported to be anti-Russian. 2. Soviet Embassy is said to have issued ultimatum threatening stoppage of all Russian purchases and cloth trade organizations in Gilan if the boycott is not raised within three days. There have since been meetings between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Russian trade representative. 3. It is believed that Persian Government will give way gradually in order to save their face and at the same time strive to secure partial Russian recognition of Persian policy of trade centralization,on lines adumbrated in commercial secretary’s reports. See particularly his despatch No. 279 to Department of Overseas Trade which left by bag on January 1st. 4. Situation appears similar to that reported in Sir R.
