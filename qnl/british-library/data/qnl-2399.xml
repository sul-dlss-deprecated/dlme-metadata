If Basra is to be the terminus of the Baghdad Railway, the settlement of the long-standing difficulties concerning the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab becomes an urgent necessity. Duties in those waters—dredging, buoying, lighting, sounding, policing, &amp;c,—which have been neglected by Turkey have been performed by Great Britain. This has given rise to con siderable friction from time to time ; and it is clear that any comprehensive arrangement about the Persian Gulf and the Baghdad Railway must provide for the settlement of this question with the others. The obvious solution would be to establish an Ottoman Commission, with strong British participation, to exercise independently all the functions of a navigation and port authority in the waters and on the shores of this waterway. While the personnel of this authority should be as largely as possible of Ottoman nationality, it can only be effective if the heads of both the inspection and the engineer branches are British. We shall be surprised if the agreement does not include a Convention setting up such an autho rity and defining its functions. This is the more likely, as the Karun River, in which Great Britain is interested, flows into the Shatt-el-Arab above the bar. Moreover, the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab belongs territorially to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who also owns private property on the right, or Turkish, bank. Very close relations exist between Great Britain and the Sheikh, whose de facto interests in the waterway must therefore be a matter of concern to the British Govern ment. These interests of the Sheikh are affected by the long-standing dispute over the Turco- Persian frontier, and have been the principal obstacle to a satisfactory settlement of the southern portion of that frontier. The reports are obviously correct which include this frontier question among those to be settled by the present negotiations. A settlement equitable to both Turkev and Persia will be a matter of the greatest satisfaction to Russia and Great' Britain, who have made many joint attempts at mediation during the past 70 years. Our Constantinople Correspondent, in his telegram of Thursday, spoke of the abandon ment of the Turkish right of control over Egyptian borrowing as one of the conditions of tho settlement. No one who knows the importance attached to this question by the British and Egyptian Governments can doubt that he is correctly informed. The agreement when completed and con firmed will be an event of the utmost importance for the development of Asiatic Turkey and the promotion of British trade interests in the Middle East. It must, however, not be for gotten that at present it is still in negotiation.
