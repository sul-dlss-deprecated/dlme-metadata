He recalls his youth in Suez, and his familyâ€™s experience of the 1956 and 1967 wars. El-Araby discusses his early career working for the Suez Canal Authority during the period of the 1967 war and its aftermath. After joining AUC in 1970 El-Araby worked in units within the Business Office responsible for passports and visa permissions, import-export clearances, and travel (he outlines the development of the Travel Office over the years). He explains the challenges of securing entry and exit visas, customs and censor clearances for imported goods, and shipments out of Egypt, including the process of dealing with government offices. Significant accomplishments like securing entry of scientific and computing items and construction supplies (for the Tahrir/Downtown Greek Campus library and new campus, etc.) are mentioned. He indicates the steps he took when assuming charge of the Purchasing Office, outlining its development and methods over the years, and the role of staff in the New York Office and outside agents. Steps taken in reforming inventory control, and developing warehouse storage on the New Cairo campus, are addressed as well. He speaks about the staff members functioning in various units, and who reported to him after he became director of Purchasing and Support Services in 1990 (later renamed Business Support and then Supply Chain Management). Portraits of the administrators with overall responsibility for those units, such as Assistant Business Manager Ahmed El Lozy in the 1970s and Vice President for Finance and Administration Andrew Snaith from the 1980s through the mid-2000s, are provided. El-Araby also offers his account of the case of stolen antiquities from storage at Ewart Hall after the 2011 revolution.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
