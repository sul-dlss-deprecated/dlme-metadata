Uy dear Glloert I enolose tne draft of a brief note on tUe history and legal position of Tamb and Abu uuaa, will oh was originally prepared by Dan Lasoelles, oefoi*e he left the department, for the use of our representative at Geneva, in oase the Persians should raise the question of their claim during the September meetings of the Council, but which has since been considerably expanded by ia^allay. £• before I s«w this memorandum Lan Lascelles had assured me that the c^se against the Persians at iamb was even stronger than at Bahrain, particularly as «*ersla had ceased to exercise any control at iamb even earlier than at Bahrain. This tallied with my own recollections of earlier papers, and I have always taken this line in discussing the matter with my i^cretary of otate. Since Laithwaite, Esq /reading(3) reading tarou^ii this draft jaeKoraadim, ho^aver, I am no longer quite as iaappy aoout the position as I was. It seams to me that tae fact tnat the lalands were administered for soRtetiae fey Jowasiai Sheiitns, who were not oni^ resident in Persia (however they got there) bnt were Persian suojeots (for a time at least) and Persian officials, might easily prove rery dama^in^. It Is quite true that these Sheiichs administered these particular Islands not in their capacity of Persian officials, out in their oapaaity of representatives of the Trucial rulers to whom the Islands belonged, jut this mi^ht easily be reprasented as a rather subtle c istinction, and the circumstance taat the islands were in actual fact administered by Persian officials from tae Persian mainland mi^ht well, it seems to me, be quoted against us with rather an unfortunate effect. The point may become of some importance, as there are indications tnat the Persians coay now press their claim to lamb and possibly to ^bn usa more strongly than in the past* It is just possible even that the Persians may now concentrate on their claim to / lambI per % aud -&gt;DU -waa. ..amoranduni u'x * La^ oei _i'£.£ &gt;te howevar, para^jrapt- £ below). llie position as re^arda the jesrsiaii aUlm to ttio islands of iamb and Abu anaa is fa eneraUy aiailar to tnat as ratards tiia j&gt;arslan claim to ianrain. Our oass, taat is to •ay. rests on the fact that Persia Has not exercised effectlTe dominion In these Is^-- for at least lb4 ysars (as against 151 year^ in the ease of aahraln)a It is flouotful, indeed, wUether even before 1750 she exercised dominion at Tamb end Abu iinsa, whereas it is certain that she exercised dominion over Bahrain for e period before 17^3. Si. The i?erslan case has never been put forward systematicalljr• but it is understood to be based on the following two points.- (ii Tamb and iibu mrnx were shown as Persian on a *ar Office map presented to the Shah in lbb6; (2) the Jowasimi ^rab sheixhs of /Lln^ahLin^an (a port on the Persian ooait), who adminlstared iamb and Abu luea for a lon^ period before their final expulsion from Persia In 1867, were, for a part of tiiat period, Persian subjects ^overnin^ Lingah as Persian officials. The Persian Goyernnent are under- I stood to contend that the Sheiichs administered tnese Islauds also in their capacity of Persian officials. 3. Point (1) is unfortunate, but its importance as an argument is largely counter- acted b^ tne fact that both oefore and after the date on which the cap was presented the Persian claifi was etuphatieally and officially repudiated by His majesty's Governnont. 4. as regards (2) our contention is that this is a complete misconstruction of the facts, which are as follows; 5* Since the early part of the 16th century, and possibly earlier still, an Arab family or small clan tnown as the Qawazim or z Jo*asimi hare ruled orer a large part of what / Their subjects and tributaries are also generally called jowasimi but the name really applies to - the ruling family only.¥ 10 W is now conirioniy oalled tae xruoial toast* At first their headquarters were at Ras-ui-iChaiinah, but in 16E0 the Sheikh of the day began to reside at Sharjah, Ras-ul-Khaimah being gorerned by one of his relatives. Tnis arrangement continued until lb(&gt;9, when the uovernor of Ras-ul-^haiiriah juade hixaself independent of ^narjah, and from that date until the present tixoe, with the exception of a brief period early in the present century, i^harjah and Has-ul-^hainah nave oean ruled as mutually independent Sheikhdoms by different branches of the wowasimi family. 6• Soon after the death of ^adir Shah in 1747, some of the Jowasimi led their followers (who then and thereafter were noted pirates and raiders) to the aid of the Persian Governor of sunder ^bcas and Hormua, who was pressed for tribute by various Persian pretenders and involved in hostilities with various neignbouring chieftaino. in the course of this and suosequent visits the Jottaslml took posa.seion of Lingah, opposite /th.the Island of aiataU and other plaoes on the Persian ooa»t. They were driren away during the asoondenoy of Karim Xhan Zand, who ruled oyer Persia from 176® to 1779, but after his death they returned, and held Lingah and tiie surrounding district as an Ar^o princip&amp;l*ty until 1887. Towards the end of this period tne Persian Gorerninent asserted thexaselves to some extent upon the coast of the Guii iu t ,fie jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah finally became in effect Persian Tassals, whose succession to the Sheikhdom was habitually recognised by the Shah in the form of an appointment as Governor of Lingah, who paid to the Shah's viceroy at Shlraz such tribute as the latter could extract from them, and who acknowledged themselves to be Persian subjects. In 1867 the Persian Government deposed the last Sheikh and toor. over the government of Lingah themselves. 7. Throughout the period under review, that is to sa^ from a date earlier than 1747 to the present day, the islands of Tsmb and Abu Musa, like the neighbouring Arab coast, have /been11/ @ been in the possession and effective ocoupatlon of the ruling Jowasimi SheiJcne, the latter have always held them, however, in auoordanoe with Arab custom, on behalf of their clan as a whole, not as their purely personal property. For mny years prior to 1867, the manageraent, administration, and jurisdiction of the two islands was by common consent vested in the chief Jowasiml Shei£h of the Persian coast, that is, the ^heiich of Lin^ah, a near relative of the i&gt;heii:h8 at ^harjah and Ras-ul- ^haiumh. This administration was carried out on behalf of the family as a whole. After the extinction of the Lln^ah principality in 1667, the administration of iamb was transferred from Lingah to Ras-ul-iChnlraah, while Abu Lusa was attached direct to Sharjah. This administrative division was maintained when Sharjah and Has- ul-ihaimh were temporarily re-united in the present century and when taey a c aln oecame separate, with the result that aU u imsa now belongs to the Sheiich of ;&gt;harjah and Tawo to the ShelJkh of Ras-ul-&gt;i:hainsn.6. iilthouga, tnoreforo, tne ^nelKas of LiJQ^&amp;h who admlalstared lamb and hon kuaa were at one period ^erelan yaesaie and even Persian officials, this fact was in no wa^ whatever responsible for their connexion with the two Islands• The Jowaslal owned iamb and aou kusa long before any of their number established themselves on Persian soil: the dominant ShelJch of the clan (and the greater part of the clan) never ceased to reside on the 'iruclal Coast: the rights of the Llngah Sheiichs, which were in any case derived from their family connexion and not from their position in Persia, were at all times shared with, and subordinate to. the rights of the SheiJchs on the irncial Coast; and when the Ilngah Sheiiths were finally driven from Persia, any shadow of connexion between their rights and Persia went with them. For the rest, the wowasirai have never acicnowledged Persian sovereignty over the islands, and documentary evidence of their rights has been produced to the Residency Agent on the Xruclal Coast. /».' 9. ^ minor difference between Bahrain on the one hand, and Tamb and Abu Muaa on the other, Ia that while Bahrain lies close to the Arabian shore, Tamb and Abu &amp;!usa are well out in the Gulf; Tamb is a good deal closer to the i 'ersiar thin to the Arabian coast, Abu j^sa is slightly nearer the Arabian. 10* The Persian claim to these Islands was first asserted in 1867, the year in which the Jowasimis of Lingah were finally drlren out of Persia; and has been re-asserted on five occasions between then and now, on the first of these occasions, in 1904, both iamb and Abu kusa were temporarily occupied oy the Persians, wno, howeyer, were induced, without the use of force, to withdraw after about a month. Less serious attempts to assert Persian sovereignty were made by Persian customs officials on three other occasions, in eacn case the Persian Government reserved their rights, but, as already stated, they have never set forth their case in a full and systematic fashion. 11. It should perhaps be added that /untiluntil 1687 th* fcUtory of the neighbouring island of blrri was identical with that of iamb and Abu i^usa. (Sirri, lilce Tarab, Is rather nearer to Persia than to Arabia). It was the Persian seizure of 3irri in that year, and the establishiasnt of a Persian oustoms post, whioh gave rise to the whole dispute. On wider politloal grounds His Majesty's uoverniaont aoquiesoed de facto in the Persian oooupatlon, but they hare never recognised it de jur e* in the draft ^nglo-persian general treaty (now virtually abandoned) it was proposed to perpetuate the existing d e facto position, Persia recognising that iamb and Abu Musa belonged to the Jowasial Shelxhs of Oman wnile His Majesty's Government (on behalf of the SheiJLh of dharjah) recognised Sirri as Persian. The possibility of leasing THiRb to Persia was also examined in connexion with these negotiations, but it is unlixely that the SheiXh of Ras«ul-^halmah would lease the Island on any terms acoeptaole to the Persian Government* /IE.12• Tlie Governraent of India imaintttln a llght-^ouse on Tamb, whioh is otiieirwise of little iaportanoe, Qavlnfe only aoiae fifty innabitants.

The ouLstanding facts, which are in our favour, appear to be that; (1) The Jowasimi Shaikhs had possession of Tamb and Hbu Musa both long before and long alter the period when the Shaikh of Lingah (the uhie^ Jowasimi Shaikh) was a i ersian subject. (2) The Shaikh of Lingah during the time he was a Persian subject only administered the tAO islands on behalf of the Jowasimi tribe who as a whole, (P.G.13. page 98 paragraph 7), remained (3) The Shaikh of Lingaa only paid tribute to trie Shah for Lingah not Tamb and Abu Musa.

If the Persian delegate should assert these claims in the course of this year's general discussion before the Assembly, Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that it would be sufficient for the United Kingdom Lelegation to make a short counter—statement* Such counter—statement should, in his opinion, be quite brief and summary, in order to avoid giving the Assembly any impression that .lis Majesty's Government regard Persia's claims as deserving of serious consideration* So far as tho Loaguo ot—ilationo io concerned a reference to the published correspondence would probably be sufficient* If the Persian claims to Tamb and Abu Musa should also have been referred to, he suggests that it would suffice to state that while the history of these barren islands prior to 1750 is obscure, since that date authority over them, and such eifective occupation as has existed, has had its origin in the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast of Arabia, that their representative, the Sheikh of Shargah on that coast, who exercises authority Under-Secretary of State, over/ P o reignWf ice, ^ ^ ^2. over these islands, is an independent ruler in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government and that the Persian claim, which appears to have first been put forward so recently as 1887, has been repudiated by His Majesty's i Government acting on his behalf. 3. If, however, Persia should seek to raise her claims before the Council, under either Article 11 or Article 15 of the Covenent, Sir Samuel Hoare has considerable hesitation in accepting without qualification Sir John Simon's vi^w that there is no argument which could be advanced as a valid objection to the Council's dealing with the merits of the case under either of these articles. He would have doubted whether either article is strictly relevant. Persia's claim to Bahrein for example, is in effect a refusal to recognise the status of Bahrein as an independent State in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. The most relevant words in Article 11 are those which declare it to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to attention 'any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends', while Article 15 relates to disputes 'likely to lead to a rupture'. Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be desirable for the British representative to point out that the independence of Bahrein is not a circumstance which in any way endangers peace, and that it is not likely to lead to a rupture unless Persia proposes to attack Bahrein, which His Majesty's Government presume is not her intention. He suggests that it would be desirable to make this point in order, from the commencement, to set the matter in its proper light before members of the Council. But/v/ ■ ^ 3. But it might perhaps 'be wise to acid that His Majesty's Government, while doubting whether the articles of the Covenant are in any way applicable, nevertheless have no desire to prevent the Council 'being seized of the question on that account, on the understanding that, whatever might be the result of the proceedings. His Majesty^ Government consider that they will not be precluded thereby from resisting aggression by Persia if the latter should be so ill-advised as to embark upon such a course. 4. As regards the position which would arise,if, as maybe anticipated, the Council suggested a r ef erence to the Permanent Court of International Justice, Sir Samuel Hoare has the following observations to offer to Sir John Simon*s view that it would be preferable to accept such a reference rather than allow the Council to arrive at its conclusion on the advice merely of its own committee of legal experts. He would be prepared to accept Sir John Simon's reasoning on this choice of alternatives if the case were one in which His Majesty's Government could afford to run the risk, however small, of an adverse decision by the International Court. But in the present case it is necessary to envisage the consequences which would follow if the totally unexpected happened and the Court gave a decision in Persia^ favour# In that event Sir Samuel Hoare cannot see that His Majesty's Government would have any alternative liut to refuse to implement the decision, having regard alike to their strategic and other interests# their obligations of honour and justice to the Sheikh and finally their own reputation for faith and loyalty throughout the Middle East. He would therefore suggest that before it is decided to agree to a reference of the Bahrein case to the Permanent Court a preliminary decision is/is first required on the question whether, in the conceivable event of an adverse decision. His Majesty's Government are prepared to depart so far from their policy of co-operation with the League as to decline absolutely to implement a decision by the Court. He would be glad to receive an expression of Sir John Simon's views on this point. 5. If, on the other hand, the Council dealt with the matter after reference to its own expert committee and made an adverse or inconclusive report, though the risk of this appears to be regarded as slightly less remote than that of a wrong decision by the Court, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the evil consequences vvouldbe far more tolerable. In the first place it seems probable that an adverse report by the Council would not be unanimous, but that at least some members other than the parties to the dispute would lend their support thoughout to His Majesty's Government• In this event it does not appear that any grave consequences would ensue, since under paragraph 7 of Article 15 the effect of aciion-unanimous report is merely tliat members of the League retain their freedom of action. Even on the gravest and least probable hypothesis of an unanimous report in Persia's favour the only effect appears to be that under paragraph 6 of Article 15 no member of the League would go to war with Persia in order to assist His Majesty's Government in resisting possible Persian aggression. But if Persia were so foolish as to resort to war, presumably there could be no question of this country's own right to resist aggression, especially if the caveat suggested at the end of paragraph 3 above had been entered at the outset. There remains the hypothesis suggested in paragraph/( ^ ' 6 . ; paragraph 9 of your letter that in an attempt to spare Persian susceptibilities the Council might frame its report in such terms as would not finally dispose of Persia* s claim. The result of this, however, would be the continuance of the status uuo and His Majesty's Government would not 'be in an appreciably worse position than that which obtains at the present. 6. On this comparison of the possible results of an adverse decision by the Court of International Justice and of an adverse or inconclusive report by the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare feels, having regard to what is at stake upon each event, that it is preferable to run a slightly greater risk of the far lesser evil. 7» If Persia^ claim is taken up by the Council, it would certainly seem desirable to wait for Persia to develop her case before finally deciding on the exact line to be taken in reply. Sir Samuel Hoare considers, however, that, for the reasons suggested above, it would in any event be preferable to decline a reference to the International Court and he also suggests that, with a view partly to explaining to the members of the Council the reasons of His Majesty's Government's attituae, it would be highly desirable that the British representative, at the commencement of his counter- statement before the Council, should give an adequate account of the actual status of Bahrein and of the reasons why His Majesty's Government is a party to the dispute. 8. In making this last suggestion Sir Samuel Hoare has had the advantage of reading Mr.Beckett's minute of 15th August 1934, enclosed with the demi-official letter y from the Foreign Office of 23rd August, £&gt;.5277/2369/91, which suggests that Bahrein is really under the sovereignty of His Majesty's Government from the point of view of international/&lt;§) international law# Whatever may be the exact position in international law, Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that the international responsibility of His Majesty^ Government in respect of Bahrein is a practical and necessary consequence of the lact that by treaty with the Sheikh they are in exclusive control of his external relations. But it is also an important fact that Bahrein is not a British possession and that the Sheikh is an independent potentate in the sense that he exercises sovereignty in his internal affairs. It is necessary to bear this aspect of the case in mind as well as the international responsibility of His Majesty's Government, and Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be particularly desirable to lay great stress on these facts in any argument before a political body such as the Council ot the League of Nations, some of whose members might otherwise be so ill-informed as to suppose that His Majesty's Government may have acquired, or may seek to acquire, by usurpation or otherwise, jurisdiction over Bahrein as a British possession. 9. The Secretary of State accordingly suggests that if the Council of the League take Persia's claim to Bahrein into consideration, the statement of the British case should give prominence to the following points (a) that Bahrein is not a British possession but an independent State in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, and that the latter make no sort of claim to internal sovereignty; (b) that although His Majesty's Government is a party to the dispute with Persia because the Sheikh has entrusted the control of his external relations to them and Bahrein herself is not a member of the League, nevertheless, in a matter of such importance as a claim by a foreign power to bring Bahrein into subjection. His Majesty's Government naturally could not take any action contrary to the wishes of her ruler; that His Majesty's Government are in honour bound to protect his independence; that he repudiates the Persian claim; that though both he and His Majesty's Government are convinced that the Persian case is entirely frivolous, he naturally objects/7. objects to the submission of a dispute involving the very existence of the Bahrein State to arbitration or settlement by an outside authority, and that if His Majesty's Government were so to submit it against his wishes, such action would be a clear abuse of their position as his trustee* 10. Sir Samuel Hoare hopes that Sir John Simon may be able to agree to the suggestions made in this letter* If, however, the matter has to be further considered, it is clear that it will not be practicable to give final instructions to the British representatives at the forthcoming meetings of the Council of the League, as the questions at issue will need the careful consideration of the Cabinet* It is observed that Tehran telegram No.114, of 25th August indicates no special reason for supposing that the Persian Government intend to bring up their claims at those meetings. If, however, they should place them on the agenda before a decision has been reached as to the line to be adopted by His Majesty's Government, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the British representative on the Council should be instructed to secure a postponement, as any such claim is obviously a matter of which due notice should be given and which possesses no degree of urgency* I am.

H October 22. 1934, CONFIDENTIAL. / _ ■ S ection 1. [E 6475/139/34] Vo. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received October 22.) (No. 443.) Sir, Tehran, September 29, 1934. I HAVE the honour to transmit, herewith, a copy of the note which, in accordance with your instructions, I handed to the Prime Minister to-day. His Highness looked rather perturbed by its perusal and said that he knew nothing whatever about the matter, and that it often happened that action was taken at a distance from the capital without the instructions and without the knowledge of the Central Government; it was also quite possible that the Persian naval officers knew nothing more about Tamb and Abu Musa than that Persia claims sovereignty over them. I replied that it was impossible for us to act on the assumption that the commander-in-chief of a naval force, whether great or small, was not aware of the general political situation in the waters where he operated. Moreover, as regards the second visit, it had taken place after our senior naval officer had explained our point of view to Lieutenant-Colonel Bayendor and after, as we knew positively, there had been contact between the Persian sloops. 2. His Highness then asked whether I had any details of the conversation between yourself and Bagher Khan Kazemi, and he expressed the hope that the contact which had been established would prove valuable in promoting those friendly relations which Persia should have with all countries, and more especially with Great Britain, for whose work in the world he had the highest regard. I replied by giving him a rough translation of your telegram No. 90 of the 26th September. 3. I went on to say I was rather puzzled as to what the wishes of the Persian Government were in the matter of the treaty, explaining my bewilderment by a short recital of events since, shortly after I went on leave last year, his Highness told Mr. Mallet that relations had never been so good as they were at the moment (see Mr. Mallet's despatch No. 294 of the 17th June, 1933). There had then been the Basidu flag and Mudir incidents. The flag incident, with regard to which he must admit that we had been most moderate, was safely settled and the mudir was still under discussion when the Evening Standard indiscretion occurred. I discussed it strenuously with his Highness himself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and after about three weeks it proved possible for me to have an audience of the Shah. Our conversation seemed to show that His Majesty had almost forgotten both incidents, and that what he had mainly in mind was that we should get on with the treaty negotiations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, not long afterwards, told me that he was anxious to begin treaty discussions at an early date, but gradually his interest entirely evaporated and in its place we had the outrageous charge that we were stirring up disaffection in Baluchistan and Mr. Christopher Sykes was nearly expelled as a suspect. Finally, I received from Kazemi a letter on the subject of the negotiations which, though vaguely worded, appeared to indicate that the Persian Government had decided to abandon them. Was his Highness surprised at my saying I was bewildered? 4. I went on to say that shortly before he left for London, Hussein Khan Ala told me (I now remember it was Lieutenant-Colonel Loch) that the Persian Government had been examining the draft treaty and had reached the conclusion that much of it was unacceptable and that the negotiations would almost have to begin afresh. His Highness replied that it was true that the treaty had been re-examined, in October, he thought, and that it was considered that Persia was being asked to give much away and was to receive little in return. I replied that in my view Persia was being asked to surrender nothing concrete whatsoever— claims, such as that to Bahrein, which she actually did not wish to see realised— and she would receive in return definite, even if small, practical benefits, and 1 enquired whether the Shah was cognisant of the details of the draft treaty. [240 y 1]Feroughi answered that the Shah never knew details and probabh had only a general idea of what the draft contained, especially as he bel i e^e( tha eymour- tache did not make any special effort to keep His Ma.iest&gt; informed 5. After some further conversation, his Highness made the interesting j statement that he was virtually certain that if we had agreed to &gt;ui render Tamb and Abu Musa when Teymourtache first suggested it, the treaty negotiation, '' ''' b . h\ V theT e revert U ed h to the recent incidents at Tamb, and said that if the Persian Government really desired a treaty they must avoid creatinu incidents. His Hiehness repeated that he did not know for what purpose the sloop had landed a party at Tamb. I told him that the commanding officer of the swond sloop had told the captain of H.M .S. Bidef that he had come to look for a Persian deserter. His Highness then said that the Persian sloops were placed ' in a position of difficulty inasmuch as they could not make a normal notification without appearing to admit that Tamb and Abu Musa were foreign territory. I told his Highness that Tamb and Abu Musa were on precisely the same footing as Sirri. lie probably remembered that when H.M .S. Ormonde visited the Gulf for surveying purposes, we requested permission I or landings to be eftec- ted at a variety of ^Persian ports and islands, and also requested the Persian Govern ment to notify their officials on the Sirri Island that she would also pa\ a visitM there, and we added a sentence to the effect that this communication did not imply I a recognition of Persia s de jure title to the island. 1 could not see why Persian Government should not, if they required their sloops to go to Tamb and Abu Musa, do the same, nor could I see why the Persian Government should insist on pretending that the Arab rulers were not entitled to place the conduct of their tj foreign relations in our hands*, even if the Persian Government vseie deteimined I to maintain this attitude they would be well advised to seek to mitigate its inconveniences, which were not entirely one-sided. ith regard to Tamb and Abu Musa, the other alternative was to keep away altogether, otherwise a serious incident seemed inevitable, and the only possible result of an incident which 1 | could see would be to establish the fact, which nobody wanted to prove, that the British naval forces were stronger than those of Persia. This I said half jokingly, and his Highness responded. 7. Resuming in a tone of full seriousness, I said that, but for the conversa tion which you had had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it appeared possible that I should have received instructions to communicate officially to the Persian Government the orders which had been issued to the senior naval officer. As matters now stood, His Majesty's Government wished to avoid making a communication of such a nature, but I had been instructed to inform his Highness orally of the nature of these instructions in order that there might be no possi- j bility of a misunderstanding. I then read to him slowly paragraphs 1 and 2 of your telegram No. 93 of the 26th September. 8. A slightly painful silence ensued, which I broke by saying that it was quite unnecessary that there should be trouble between us; there was more than enough trouble in the world as it was. I finally took my leave after once again urging that the Persian sloops should keep away from Tamb and Abu Musa and asking his Highness to acquaint himself with the report which would doubtless have been received from the Persian Minister in London on his interview with you yesterday. 9. I should add that, at one stage, I mentioned the announcement reported in my telegrams Nos. 127 and 128 of the 27th September, that consuls from the Foreign and Political Department were no longer desired. Feroughi knew nothing about it, but seemed to think that it would be an excellent thing if political officers from India were not sent here. I said that, if the Persian Government desired a change, they could have invited us to discuss the matter, but the action they had, in fact, taken was highly discourteous. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 199) and to the Acting Political Resident in the Persian &lt;;ulf (No. 165). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE.■Ik m 11 'if ll l ■ LP Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to M. Feroughi. Your Highness, Gulhek, September 28, 1934. I HAVE the honour, under instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform your Highness that he was much pleased to have had the opportunity at Geneva of discussing Anglo-Persian relations with his Excellency Bagher Khan Kazemi, who, in the course of the conversation, stated that the Persian Government wished to resume the treaty negotiations. In the ordinary course of events Sir John Simon would have awaited with interest a further communication from the Imperial Government on the subject of the treaty negotiations. 2. He was, however, disquieted to learn on his return to London that, almost simultaneously with his conversation with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Persian warship had paid yet a further visit to Tamb without prior notification and had landed a party on the island. 3. In the view of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom this visit, following on the previous visit of His Imperial Majesty's ship Palang on the 28th August last (the 6th Shahrivar), when an Arab dhow was searched in Tamb territorial waters, can only mean one of two things: either the Persian 'Government wish to create a fictitious value for their claim in future negotiations; or else they are unwilling to make use of the peaceful and legal methods by which it is open to them to pursue it, and are determined to achieve their object by methods which are quite incompatible with their position as signatories of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of the Kellogg Pact. 4. It is impossible for His Majesty's Government to acquiesce in either situation, and I am instructed to make it clear that the total cessation of such tactics is an essential preliminary to the resumption of negotiations. 5. It is the earnest hope of His Majesty's Government that the Imperial Government will recognise the justice of this view, and, if they do, in fact, desire to resume negotiations, take such steps as will make resumption possible.

The Shaikh admits removing flagstaff for the following reasons: (a) Tanb is useless to him, he gets no income from it and must try to lease it owing to the financial situation (b) In order to get a representative of the British Government to come and discuss question of island with him 2. Isa reminded the Shaikh of his Treaty obligations and told him that he should not have removed flagstaff without informing somebody especially the Poli- -tical Resident. 3. Shaikh told Isa that he had sometime ago suggested to the Political Resident that the British should rent Tanb from him. As the Political Resident had replied that the British did not want to rent Tanb the Shaikh says that he is now in treaty with someone else to rent it but does not say who. Isa thinks that the Shaikh is here referring to the Persians but that it is reallyreally a bluff to get money from us and that the Persians would be most unlikely to rent island as they claim it as their own. 4 ' al Khaimah says that he did not order Mahmood to threaten arrest or deportation of Indian lighthouse-keeper and does not believe that Mahmood did so. 5« Public opinion ia ^as al Khaimah is completely against Shaikh's action. Report ends. I have told Hussein to send a messenger to Isa with the following queries (a] Is Ras al Khaimah going to replace flagstaff if so when ? (b) Is Has al Khaimah really thinking of letting Tanb if so to whom or is this bluff ? Isa is staying at Has al Khaimah for the present in case you have further instructions for him.

Dated the 4th February 0935. My telegram No.27 of 3rd February. TAJ/IB. Fact that Shaikh removed his flag, that later his representative Ifehmud left island thus leaving it open for any other party to take over, and that letter apparently consists of Persian official notices, make it possible that plot exists between Shaikh and Persian Government for latter to take over island • 2. This would not debar Shaikh from financial benefit since (1) he may have received bribe from Tehran or (2) if plot . . . ^ J -P-PA + v he failed and was not proved (which is matter of difficulty ) he might expect to receive rent from us to induce him to replace his flag. 3. Persian Government on their side migat have (1) expected to repeat their success at SIRRI (F .G.13 page 98) or (2) if (as would actually have occurred in present instance) their notices were taken down and the Mudir expelled by 'eloop, might have planned to take matter to League under Article 15 of Covenant,i .e. that dispute likely to lead to a rupture had arisen between themselves and His Majesty 's Government, in this event Persian Government would doubtless have endeavour- ed to link question of Tamb with that of Banrain. 4. If such a plot existed then a serious crisis was + q r&gt;r H.M.Sloops which probably averted by the prompt visi -^ prevented / Jprevented Mudir and notices reaching Tamb and so long as a sloop is fct Tamb the plot is not likely to be pursued. 6. But whether the plot exists or not we cannot indefinitely (a) keep a sloop stationed at Tamb or (b) keep island without a flag. 6. I recomiaend therefore that I be authorised to write to Shaikh (who already since beginning of incident has had a month to make up his mind) as follows: (1) that if he replaces his flag on Tamb within a certain period (which I will suggest later) His Majesty's Government are prepared to consider paying him rent for the lighthouse % but flag must be replaced first* (2) that if he does not replace flag then the other Jowasimi Shaikh ^i.e.Sharjah will be allowed to do so* (Vide my telegram No.8 of 6th January).^ ^ ^ { 7. I would arrange for contents of my letter to become known in Has al Khaimah and Shaikh's people who are strongly against his action would probably bring pressure to bear on him to agree though of course he may continue to be obstinate. 8. From the local point of view I would not myself recommend the offer of rent for the lighthouse since it is in the nature of a concession to a Shaikh who has behaved badly.

I am posting note which should reach you February 14th, gist of which is as follows. Tamb belongs to Jowasimi Tribe, of which the Chief Shaikhs are Sharjah and Has al Khaimah and is locally regarded as connected with latter. Up to 1921 we treated Ras al Khaimah as part of Sharjah, and accordingly in 1912 it was from latter that concurrence in erection of light house on Tamb was obtained. In 1921 Government ot India recognised Ras al Khaimah as separate Shaikhdom. If Ras al Khaimah secedes then presumably the other Jowasimi Shaikh i.e. Sharjah can resum e possession ol Island. -Resident- (Copy given to S.N.O.,P-G. under P .L.N0.191-S of 8 /2/35).a *•, Of '/O^ NOTri ON Oi^KKRSHlP OF TAI/IB.

Both Sharjah and .ias al Khaimah were possessions of the Jowasiml clan, the heads oi which resided indifferently at either place and were indifferently described as 'Shaikh of Sharjah' or .'Shaikh of Has al Khaimah'. At some periods one Shaikh ruled over both places at others the rulers were separate Shaikhs. Tamb may therefore be described as belonging to the Jowasimi ■'•ribe. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah seized administration of Ras al Khaimah proclaimed himself independent of Sharjah and continued so 'till his death in 1900» Shaikh iumaid bin Abdullah died. Sharjah and Has al Khaimah reunited unuer Shaikh Saqar bin Khalid who appointed his son Khalid bin Saqar as Governor of Sas al Khaimah.

The 6th February 1935 To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRS i»l WJ.'IQRANDUM* . 1 I Reference your Confidential Memorandum No,lS9-3, dated 24th January 19 35, I append with this a short note on the subject of the Arab custom of a tribe or community holding property 'in common' which I trust may be of assi stance. 2, The subject however is really a big one, and cannot be dealt with properly in the form of a note, however full. Lt •-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. /a / / /? erf niZyfv . ! * ''/A^3 NO Til ON TH j : CUSTOM OF HOLDING PROPERTY' n IN COMMON'. I. subject is not an easy one and much, no doubt, could be written about it, if one iiad the leisure. Putting the case as shortly as possible, however, one may say that land is held in the Arabian Peninsular under two main systems: (a) That of private ownership; (b) That of Tribal Ownership. II. Under system (a) which is confined almost entirely to the settled or Town population of Arabia, an individual buys or inherits his lands in the first place, (it may also be a bequest) and on his death, it (the land) must according to 'Sheria^ Law, be divided among his heirs. The males getting so many shares and the females ditto. III. These heirs however very often arrange among themselves, for either political or 'family protective reasons', not to divide the property, and elect to leave it in the hands of the senior member of the family to be administered and managed as the latter considers fit, they the heirs getting their individual rights in the shape of fixed share of the produce, or a salary, or both. So long as the property is administered reasonably well and individuals are properly treated, the system works satisfactorily. But should the reverse take place, then there is trouble as division into fair shares often becomes a most difficult matter, especially after several generations have held the property, without dividing it. The same 'protective instinct' which tends to keep property in the hands of the head of the family, can similarly be traced in the age long and practically universal/- 2 - 12S) universal system among Arabs (especially the tribes) of first cousin marriages - the idea being to prevent the girl going away from the family, or out of the tribe, and so talcing her share of the property with her, which would inevitably end in weakening the family or home tribe (hamoula)• in Kuwait we have many examples of this joint possession of property, notably the date gardens of the Shaikhly house of the A1 Subah on the bhatt al Arab, which by consent of the whole family, have been managed and administered for many years by the Huler himself* The same system is today also in existence in Riath where I understand Bin Saud looks after the garden and house property of all the members of the a1 Saud family, and also was the fashion during Turkish times among the great families of the Al Saadun and Naqibs of Basra. v# it should never be forgotten however that according to the strict letter of the bheria Law the system is wrong (just like the veiling of women), and any individual, who happens to be dissatisfied with his lot, can theoretically claim to be given his lawful share of the family property, whatever it be and at any time. In practice it is not so easy, especially when the family as a whole has approved the system, or the head of the house happens to be a ruler of a State like Bin Saud, the Imam Yahya, or Ibn Subah. Yi, it is quite clear that the system of trying to keep the family property together, originated in the days when anarchy and disorder existed in Arabia, and when it was necessary and very essential to keep the family strong, for protective purposes. We see signs of the same fear in the fortress like way all Arab houses are built (i.e. the absence of all outside windows and the small door in the centre of the big door). VII. It is further quite clear also that the system is so deeply rooted in the heart of every Arab, as to be''MTTaMiit ^2) - 3 - as to be at onoe his strength and his weakness - His strength because it keep the family life healthy and strong, his weakness because it teaches him to believe that all Kings, Governments etc, as we know them are tyrannous and hostile always to individual interests. It, in other words, tends to perpetuate the patriarchal or tribal system, which admits only the Shaikh or the head of the family (hamoula) as the authority to be obeyed. Hence the perpetual hostility / for instance, of the tribes of Arabia ^o being ruled by a King like Bin Saud ; and hence the lack of 'patriotism 1 * as we know it, and the impossibility of getting tribes ever to cooperate together in big or small things - The beginning and end of h\s ideas on life being the family and the tribe. VIII. To turn now to system (b) - See para I above: '/ '• A ttibe always owns its grazing and tribal lands (including wells etc.) jointly, and never individually. And in consequence the tribe as a whole Jealously guard its possessions against aggression from outside tribes. Under the system also the position of the tribal boundaries are known exactly, by every man wcman and child, and are handed down from father to son. //ells also are more often than not marked with tribal mark (Wasm) in similar way to their camels. The Shaikh of the tribe may of course detail certain wells and grazing areas during the Summer months to certain sections and families of the tribe, as he thinks fit, but this is purely for convenience sake. He may of course not sell or part with any portion of the tribe's lands or grazing grounds to anyone. Kvery man knows this. The tribes lands are his 'trust^. IX. Under the same system, if a neigjibouring tribe, on friendly terms, happens to be short of grazing in its own country, it is always permitted to enter the tribal lands of its neighbours on payment of a nominal tribute to177: - 4 - tribute to the Shaikh of the tribe acting the part of w host rt * This (although 3in Saud and other Arab rulers in their efforts to europeanize their States are trying to stor it and replace it by ^Zikat 1 * to the Central Government) is inown under the name of ' Dhabiha wa l^aniha^. It is a very ancient custom indeed, and entitles the visitors to full protection, whilst sojourning in their neighbours land, even against enemy raiders, or the police activities of the King or Central Government {such as in Saudi Arabia). iU This incidentally accounts for lack of sympathy and almost invariable hostility which Kings like Bin Saud, Hiza Shah, and Governments like Iraq who are trying to run their country on Western lines, feel for the tribes. The tribal system is a perpetual thorn in their side, X # Only one person can interfere with actual tribal property, or give it away in Arabia today, namely the n King n or n Huler w of the country of which the tribe forms part (e.g.Bin Saud), Such an 'outrage' against tribal feeling and sentiment would however be so widely resented, and ^e so dangerous, that it is unthinkable that it would ever be put into practice. FOR i^TAMPLj); Bin Saud might want to punish a trioe like the Ajman, and might order the Awazim, their neighbours, to take over half its grazing lands. The order would no douct be carried out, just because the King is ail powerful, but would remain in force just so long as Bin daud coula enforce the order. A1X the time the .ajman would be longing for the_ when they would get back their lost lands. The Awazim would equally well realize that they were trespassers on lands which no King (Sould^on earth ('give them permanently: They would withdraw as soon as they saw that ^n saud grew weak or died, as they could not face the ordeal of the bitterest of tribal wars that would ensue, with all public opinion (tribal) against them. XI. In the particular case of T a MB Island - eltnougnp? - although I am not up in events, nor have any knowledge of the question under discussion, I should say that the Island was either Owned by the Jowasim tribe as a whole, just like the Mutair own the ft SuInman ,, region North of the Dahana, and so could not be given away or sold without the consent of the whole tribe, which it is most unlikely would ever be given, or That it was the personal property (acquired^ by conquest or purchase originally) of the actual Shaikhly family of the Jowasim. In which case the Shaikh as the head of the family and trustee would be quite unable to part with the whole or part of it, without first obtaining the casent of the other members of the family - Also an unlikely contingency, unless a sufficiently good price were offered as an inducement.

It had a crew of 5. It was the sane dhow and Nakhoda that had taken the Tunh flagstaff to Ra s al Khaimah. 9, The only passenger was Mahmood, the Headman of Tunh. 6.

Ifemorandunu .1^ Your Memorandum No:129-S dated the 24th January 1935. Arab Custom of a tribe or community holding property in common, 2. An outstanding example is the A1 Khalifah (Bahrain ruling family) custom that ensures that A1 Khalifah property shall remain intact. If the A1 Khalifah Ruler grants a portion of the land of the A1 Khalifah to a member of the Family, on the death of that member the land reverts to the Ruler, who can then (a) resume it himself, (b) re-grant it or portion of it to that member T s heirs, or (c) otherwise redistribute it (but always vdthln the A1 Khallfah family ) • No A1 Shalifah land roay be sold or given away outside the A1 Khalifah family. This custom does not, of course, apply to land which a member of the A1 Khalifah family may have obtained by private purchase or other such means. It is, however, curious to note that with the coming of settled conditions, it is becoming increasingly difficult to main tain this old custom. 3. The Sa'ud custom is said to be that the property in the possession of any of the members of the family cannot re .rsrio- ferred to an outsider. Even property given by the Ruler of the State to a person outside the family reverts to the ca T ua family £ -ter the death of the person to whom the property is given and ^is family cannot enjoy the same right. 4. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, states that on the Trucial c oast the custom is that the family property reverts to that /member 1(Mfl) 2. aember of the family who Is In power and can protect the property against outside aggression. 5. Tne above is a brief outline, but sufficient perhaps to afford considerable support to the view that Qawaslm property cannot be alienated away from the Qawasim. 6* 1 re * Tet the d -elay in replying to your enquiry, but there has been a heavy press of work recently.
