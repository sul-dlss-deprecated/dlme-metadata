I hare now been able to consider the replies oi Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Oasey to the enquiries which I addressed to them before ray departure. And I hare also been fortunate enough to hare an opportunity of discussing Iranian affairs both with His Imperial Majesty the lihah and with the Iranian i rime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the first place, I should like to express my gratitude to the Iranian Government for sparing Mr. Hajir, in order that he might come here r nd discuss outstanding questions, and to Mr. Hajir himself for undertaking tae journey. I deeply appreciate the friendly spirit in &lt;hich this action was taken, and I am confident that the franK exchange of views on the questions hich Mr. Hajir has raised will serve to promote understanding and strengtnen collaboration between our t'^o Governments. dr. Hajir has asked for a clear definition of His Majesty’s Government’s intentions towards Iran, both during and after the war. iB I said in our on ^ tn ® 9th seotember, these intentions are easily deiined. They aw impUcit in the terns of the Tripartite Treaty of I of the 29th January, 1942. His ^a^e^ty s His Axcelle Mr. I Hass an Taqizadeh, 6- /Government W\GoYerisnent wish to see Iran strong, united and independent. Hie Majesty’s Government are concerned, as are also the Iranian Government, that Iran shall enjoy internal security and political and economic stability; so long as the war lasts it is also clearly of the first importance that all activities of enemy agents shall be drastically suppressed. It is realised that the use of Iranian routes as s channel of supplies to the Soviet Union, when added to the stringencies of supply and shipping imposed by war conditions, puts a heavy strain on Iranian economy. liile these conditions persist it will continue to be the endeavour of His Maje ty’s Government, in coi imitation with the Iranian, doviet and United States Governments, to do everything possible to mitigate the effects of wartime conditions on the people of Iran, provided always that the Iranian Government play their part by taking such remedial measures as lie in their power. \here it is possible to plan ahead we will do bo; for the rest, we must meet each difficulty as it arises and to the beet of our ability. In the course of the pact two years His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to moke friendly representations to the Iranian Government on a number of subjects connected with Iranian internal affairs, such as grain collection, prevention of hoarding and speculation, and the arrest of suspects. It is t rough effective action in such matters as these, where the interests of Iran and her Allies coincide, that the Iranian Government can best contribute towards the war effort of the United nations. or instance, by making the best possible use of their home-grown cereals, they will be able to avoid calls on United nations shipping which is required for other said even more necessary tasks than the transport of grain to supplement the considerable stocks already in the country. I have carefully considered the suggestion of &amp; i'rriaartite Gomoitice, which in Mr* Hajir’s opinion would i help to ensure the co-ordination of allied policy. My \ conclusion, however, is that such a solution would not in fact serve to ensure the desired result. My impressionis rather that, by requiring t ie agreement of too many authorities to any given course of action, such machinery ??ould be cumbrous in practice and would result in an unnecessary degree of interference with the Iranian Oovemment's own liberty of action. At the sane time, I fully eympathise with the Iranian Oovernraent*s desire for closer consultation in matters, particularly in the economic sphere, which affect Iranian interests; and I have examined the possible methods by which this aim micrht be secured. My view is that the most practical met od of meeting this need is the closer association of the Iranian Government with the existing supply arrangements, as Y our Excellency will be aware, these arrangements are at present entrusted in the first instance to an Anglo- American Combined Supplies Committee at Tehran, which maintains close touch with the Middle East dupply Centre in Cairo, the latter being also nn .nglo- jnerican organisation. Since most of the seaborne imports into Iran, as into other countries in the Middle East area, are obtained from British Empire or United States sources and all are carried in Allied shipping, an arrangement on the above linos is obviously necessary to ensure proper examination and co-ordination of Iran’s requirements and to arrange fair distribution of available supplies as between different countries in the Middle last* Moreover in view of the understanding between His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government by which the resources of each country are pooled for the purposes of the war effort, it is clear that all questions relating to the procurement and import of supplies for Iran can only be dealt with by a joint .agio-American organisation, and not by either of the two Governments separately. For this reason, the reference of such questions direct to London, as advocated by Mr. Kajir, would not in fact be in the interests either of the Allies or of Iran herself. I realise that the Iranian Government have felt some dissatisfaction at what they consider to be the unnecessary slowness of the present procedure. /AllI■ All possible measures have been and are being taken to eliminate delays, insofar as these are not the inevitable result of wartime conditions. But I must emphasise that the present procedure has been very carefully devised to ensure that Iranian requirements, in common with those of other iiiddle Eastern countries such as Iraq, Arabia, Egypt and Syria, are fairly and efficiently dealt with; and that there can be no question of altering the main principles of the present arrangements which are the outcome of most careful consideration and planning to meet the grave difficulties of shipping and of supply resulting from war conditions. &gt;4 While the Iranian Government have been represented on some of the sub-committees of the Combined Supplies Committee, they have not hitherto been represented on the Committee itself. I have ascertained that the British and United States authorities concerned are agreeable to Iranian representation on the combineo. Cupolies Committee, and I hope that the Iranian Government will welcome this proposal as the most practical means of associating them more closely in important economic questions affecting their interests. As regards the implementation of Article 7 of the Tripartite Treaty, I cannot agree that Mr. Ha^ir s memorandum does full justice to the economic help already extended to Iran by the Allies and by his isiesty’s Government in particular, during the period of aoproxiiaetely eighteen months after September , close on 100,000 tons of wheat and flour were imported into Iran from British and United States sources t a period when the Allies were extremely short of shippings these substantial imports woula, in large measure, have been rendered unnecessary h&lt; d the Iranian Government taken adequate steps to secure possession of the available internal grain crop on the lines repeatedly urged by His Majesty*s Legation, in the case of sugar and tea, of which Iran is normally an /importer.I— (S) Ml ^ ^ f; ^ 4 ^ importer, the quotas allotted have taken full account of Iran’s essential needs; indeed the &lt;uota ror toa has recently been raised to ovex 15,000,0€it loo. j.ot the current year, a figure representing as much as of Iran’s peace-time importB* It is, liowever, significant that ifshen this increase was offered to the Iranian Q-ovemment, the Iranian authorities hesitated to accept it since they doubted their ability to arrange for the proper distribution of the additional quantity of tea. This brings me to what must, I think, be considered as the crucial point in Iran’s economic difficulties# The Allies are anxious to increase their economic assistance to Iran in any way they can, subject to present abnormal conditions; and the Middle .^ast supply Centre are now exploring the possibility of arranging m increased uota of civil imports. But any help wrach the lilies may be able to give to Iran in this respect can only be effective in proportion as the Iranian Government tBernselves take steps to make it so. ^ supply of more goods, however desirable, can of itself produce no real improvement so long as mrO-distribution, hoarding and speculation continue to very conscious of the difficulties with which the Ir nian Government have to contend in the semeiters. mt 1 do not think it can seriously be they have yet taken all possible measures o ^ them. The first and most important of f^J®** 1 **®* ia errant of vigorous and unequivocal support oo the vlilTa now serrir* the latter are extremely able men aafl enjoy th euwort and co-operation of His Majesty s^orern ^ I wee therefore concerned to learn that la view ox the difficulties he had encouatered in ^ legislation passed, Br. lillspsa^^ ^i.irattlons recently felt compelled to offer their resignations. It is clear that 3r. Uillspaugh and his assistants /cannot- cannot carry out their onerous task of setting Iranian finances in order unless they receive a much fuller measure of support from the Iranian authorities than has hitherto been forthcoming. .nd it is equally clear that Iran’s financial difficulties, which are fundamentally due to a serious deficiency in internal revenue, cannot be brought nearer a solution unless such measures as the proposed income tax bill are passed without further, delay. To this extent Iran’s remedies are in her own hands, and nothing th^t the Allies may be able to do will materially improve the situation unless the Iranian aut orities for their part take all reasonable and practicable steps to set their own house in order. It would be beyond the scope of this letter to deal fully with all the points raised in Mr. Hajir’s memorandum. Notes on some of these points will be found in the memorandum annexed to this letter, and I will only touch on a few of them here. The difficulties in regard to the transport of civil goods in Iran have been the subject of close study by the'British authorities concerned. Fuller details are given in the accompanying memorandum, and I only wish to mention here that this question is continually under review, and that His Majesty’s aoverment for their part are anxious to see all practicable steps taken to impi’ove the present difficult situation, so far as the Railway is concerned, it ?;ill be seen from the figures in the memorandum that the allocation of sp^ce for Iranian civil requirements of all kinds, including oil, at present represents a total of 56,000 tons a month, or r^re than twice the entire estimated capacity of the Railway in 1941. The allocation of space for civil goods other than oil has in recent months been approximately 8,000 tons, and this figure has exceeded the actual amount of civil goods brought forward for despatch by rail. As regards road transport, arrangements have recently been made for assistance by the British /militarymilitaiy authorities in the transport of civil oil in certain provincial districts, and the possibility of similar assistance in the transport of grain is being urgently considered. Meanwhile, there is clearly need for more active steps by the Iranian Hoad transport Department to maintain effective control of those lorries nominally operating in its service. His Majesty’s Government are anxious to see the Iranian armed forces maintained at such a level of efficiency as will enable them to carry out their rOle of preserving internal security and, after the war, of assuring the stability and independence of the country. I am glad to leorn that the engagement of a number of assistants for General Ki&amp;Ley has now been approved, and I trust that the United States Military Mission no less than the financial Mission will be accorded all the support necessary to enable them to carry out their task. The Iranian array’s transport problems will, I hope, have been considerably eased by the recent allocation of 6CC lorries from United State® sources. His Majesty’s Government have always taken a sympathetic interest in the development of the Iranian Mr Force. The latter has, through no fault of itr own, suffered severe disadvantages in the course of the lost two years, and His Majesty’s Government are anxious to remedy this situation so far as they are able. An Air Attach^ has been added to the staff of His Majesty s Legation and, as the result of recent discussions, nis Majesty’s Government have offered to make arrangement® for twelve Iranian pilots to undergo training wita the Foval *ir Force in this country. Meanwhile, a senior officer of the Iranian ar Force is to undergo a course of administrative training in the Middle Kast, md the aircraft which were taken over from the Iranian Government in 1941 are to be replaced by new macnines. /These£1+ _ These measures isillf I hope, help to lay the ioun&amp;ation for an expanding and efficient Iranian Air Force after the war. In regard to post-war matters mor generally, it will be the policy of His Majesty’s GoTemment to promote such mutually satisfactory relations with Iran, especially in the economic and commercial sphere, as will, I hope, assist Iran in consolidating her independence and stability. Your Excellency will readily understand that while the war continues no concrete or detailed plan for the post war oeriod can be elaborated. But any infomation regarding the probable nature of Iran’s post-war economic requirements will be most welcome and will receive the careful and sympathetic study of the departments of His Majesty e Government concerned. For instance, Mr* Hajir s suggestion that it may be possible to supply British technicians to assist in the operation oX Iranian Hailway is now being examined by the Minister of War Transport. I trust that the foregoing, together with the information in the enclosed memorandum, will serve to clarify the attitude of His Majesty s Government towaras the orincipal cuestions raised by Mr, Hajir. In ^ ^ conclusion, l ^iould like again to express my thanks to y r . Hajir for t e trouble he has taken to prepare so full and detailed an exposition of the j.r nian Government s views, and my hope that the Iranian Government ^or their part will have found this exchange of views as valuable as I have myself. Believe me. My dear Minister, Yours sincerely,(- ^d40/8k./34) s # h.'A?' 1. ■au^lleei ^ludlt aet -,up,-3.y -- ? U-PtoiK *7 % The question of Iranian import quotas for the year 1943 wae dealt with in air Maurice ieterson’s letter to the Iranian Quieter {To* 4067/154/34, of tto doth July, Xhit letter also feaT# ^he correct version of the incident concerning the transport of dates from Ahwaz to Tehran, to which fr. Uajir refers on page 11 oi annex 4 oi his memorandum. It is unaerstood that av the time there were many tone of dates in Tehran of which the merchants would not even take delivery. as has been mentioned, the Middle -.ast supply oentre are now examining proposals i or an increase in the quote of civil goods for Iran, it is hoped that the Iranian authorities for their part will co-operate by taking active steps not only to improve distribution in Irei , but also by arranging for the supply of the up-to-date and reliable information which is necessary to justify any increase in imports. In this connexion, i t is perhaps not sufficiently understood by the c rape tent l*anian authorities that Iranian requirements, in exactly the same manner as requirements of other countries must in present cireumstenets, in fairness to their own and other peoples, be subjected to the closest scrutiny by Allitd su s *,1/ authorities. , p, licatiom are of course received not only from Iran, but also from the other Middle kastern countries such as Iraq, Arabia, dyria, turkey ana Igypt, and those applications vastly exceed the total volume of supplies avail Die. It therefore felloes that a given requlrem.nt can normally be m t only if toe ^vidfence in su ort oi it is adequate, ano if there Is a reasonable prospect that the goods, when delivered, will be properly distributed. In Iran these two conditions have all too often beon unfulfilled. There have been occasiom when the Iranian Government have failed, sometimes after many months of enquiry, to prouuoe reliable figures of stocks existing in the country: and distribution has frequently be n worse then even the existing difficult conaitiona could be held to warrant. The question of the supply of drugs ana, in particular, the shortage of quinine, to which reference is afcde on page i;0 of annex 4 of Mr. fiajir * e memorandum, are cases in point. Three buildings in Tehran are at present understood to contain very consiaerable stocks oi drugs, including large quantities of quinine and quinine substitutes. Theie may possibly be some rest n why the Iranian authorities are not distributing these drugs, in order that they may be available ior the Leeds of the civil population, but it is uetrlLsa in these circumstances to expect that further stocks of medicine, which are badly needed elsewhere, should be sent to Iran when effective use is apparently nut being made of the stocKS already in the country* i similarly, there are in Tehran stocks of cotton and cotton plecegoods which the Iranian authoiities have taken no steps to • aistribute, (vide page 1&lt; of enclosure 4 of Mr. H&amp;jir'e metaort nduai). The situation in respect of certain commodities would probably be improved if the Iranian Government would improve their purchasing arrangements, kor instance tue Government of India, contrary to their normal practice and at the express rt^ue-st of the Iranian Government, agreed that four-fifths of the Inuian cotton piece gooas quota allotted to Iran should be •up^lied/eup^liea to the Iranian Government instead of through private traoe channels. Six months after this decision had been announced the Iranian Government had still bought nothing. In view of this the Governiaent of India not unreasonably wish to cancel the arrangement. The Middle Last oupply Centre has been set up especially to assist Middle astern countries tc obtain fair treatment as regaias imports of war conditions. His Majesty's Government earnestly hope that Mr. HaJir will be able to improve cooperation as regards the items mentioned above and in other respects by explaining the policy which is being pursued to the Iranian authorities. 2• fransport and communications . (a) nail . The allocation of freight apace on the Xranelranian ;tailway for Iranian civil good© amounts to 80C0 tons a month, exclusive oi civil oil supplies. (For reasons which are not entirely clear, the Iranian authorities have not utilised the whole of this allocation and in no month hitherto have actual loading© of civil goods exceeded 5,400 tons). In addition, the present allocation for civil oil supplies (i.e. exclusive of the oil requirements of the Allied military authorities an . of the Hallway itself) ia at present 9L1 tons per day. Thus the total civil allocation amount© at present to approxiaa lely G50o0 tone per month, or almost 6 times the whole of the estimated capacity of the railway in September, 1941 (12,000 tone per month), oven allowing for the fact that the present allocation for civil oil may be unusually high, it is clear that there is no ground for any suggestion that due allowance for the needs of Iron i© not sn ae by the Allies in their use of the all way. (b) Hoad . At the present time the Iranian Hoad Transport department have at their disposal 90^ g-ton and d-ton trucks supplied unaer Lease/heno arrangements, in addition they i±ave unaer their nominal 1 control ab ut IQoG contracted vehielce; but owing to ineffective suptrvision resulting in large-scale desertion of truck© the contracted fleet ha© shrunk to about 00 vehicles. The first condition of any general improvement in the road transport situation is that the aoad Transport Department should take active steps to regain control of uhe deserted vehicles. Meanwhile, since the present fleet ia inadequate to meet immediate calls on the department's resources, the allied authorities Lave been urgently considering ways in which assistance can be given, notably the following;- (i) The British military authorities have undertaken t move all civil oil on the Kermanshah-Tabri© rmte during ctuber ana tc assist ihe Iranian Hoad Transport department to move similar oil on the I uhahruo^^snea Tft'fift* bb tr&gt; ©weure 2 months* | reserve at Meshed. (ii) Arrangements have been agreed under which the British militsiy authorities will assist with the trans ort of grain from collecting centres to the nearest point on the railway, whence it can be moved by rail to Tehran. (iii) negotiations are in progress between the British, Soviet and Iranian authoritie© which, If successful, woulu permit the carriage of back-losus of civil 1 o:de by T6rrles working for the 1 W?d kinguom p vommercial oorporaiion and Irans.vtxans. ^The foregoing are emergency measures designed to aaaist the Iranian authorities until euch time as the koad Transport Department iiae succeeded in regaining effective control of its vehicles, huch control, as stated above, is essential o any general and lasting improvement. The supply of aduitional road transport vehicles for | civilian purposes in Iran together *ith the allocations of tyres, tubes and spare parts, will be carefully considered ( by the kiodle Last Supply Centre in the light of Iran's need in elation to the supply position of these critical war matt rials. If tne supplies which the kiddle last supply Centre are able to make available are to be used to the best advantage, it is essential that all necessary steps are taken to secure a census and the registration of all civil vehicles and to ensure, by control over the issue of tyres and spare parts and by any other methods which may be recommended to the aoad Transport Board, that vehicles are only employed on work essential to the community, cnly by the exercise of such control will it be possible to prevent large numbers of vehicles being immobilised through lack of tyres or other essential parte. 0. Financial freement covering Allied use of Iranian uailways His Majesty's Government fully recognise the desirability of concluding an agreement on this subject as early as possible, ana the question is unuer active consideration. The matter however holds very considerable complications and though no effort will be spared to resolve these with the least possible aelay it cannot be said with certainty that final proposals will be ready for presentation to the Iranian Government in the immediate future. Th&lt; question is of course one in which the ooviet ana United btates Governments, no less than His Majesty's Government and the Iranian Government, are closely concerned. M anwhile it is recognised that the delay in concluding this agreement has r suited from circumstances outsiae tne Iranian Government's control, and negotiations are now in progress between the British and Iranian authorities in Tehran with a view t. reaching a settlement which would ensure that, pending the conclusion of a definitive agreement, the present large payments on account made by the British authorities in respect of freight carried are kept fully up-to-date. By this mt&amp;ne it is hoped to eliminate any loss which the Iranian Government may have sustained in the past through such payments falling in arrears. In return lor this arrangement, the Iranian Government will be expected to ensure that their outstanding debt to the United Kingdom vommercial Cor oration is liquidated as soon as possible and is also not allowed to fall in arrears. 4• Local purchases by Allies force s. All bulk purchases of gooas fox* the use oi either the British or unitea wtetes forces are considered by the .rmy ocal iurcnaee Tomtittee in Tehran, on which the United btates ^nd British military authorities are represented. This committee works in close coIiabox»ation with the irlce ..taoilis at ion Section of the Iranian Ministry of Finance uni er Dr. Millspaugh. The Allied authorities concerned are fully alive to the need t to restrict local pux’chasee to a minimum. The United otates Army mt^sv-of its needs Irwia abroad, buys no meat locally and has only recently made local purchases of fresh vegetables. The British authorities have endeavoured to make as much use as possible of centralised channels for their purchases, out Lave obtained their sullies of fresh provisions uirect from local contractors. Purchasesr recently made neceeeary the refusal of requ sts from two Allied belligerent countries, Mexico and Cuba, for the raising of his Majesty’s Legations in these countries to jibaesies* The whole situation with regard to the designation of diplomatic missions will no doubt be rt yiewed t:fter the war.Minute Paper.

UoUiu ^T* Hajhir, Persian Minister of Communications, who ^s on a visit to this country has produced a very lengthy memorandum on internal conditions and Allied policy in Persia, the most important points of which are summarised in the Foreign (Office telegram No. 878 below. Very briefly, these are:- (a) That there should be constituted at Tehran a tripartite committee consisting of British, Persian, and Russian members at which we and the Russians would state our requirements and the Persian Government would say what they considered to be the necessary means of fulfilling them. (b) That there should be reference direct to London of all questions which cannot be settled expeditious- ly in Tehran. 98 a 1000 6.31 H.M. Minister has suggested that the main object of (a) is to form a tribunal in which the Persians would be the plaintiffs and the Russians the defendants and the British the judges and policemen. As for (b^ 'tefrwYjnrryareTr the purpose of this is presumably to by-pass the M.E.S.C., the alleged slowness of whose procedure and the inadequacy of the quotas allotted by it to Persia have been a source of complaint to the Persians for scare time. It does not seem probable that anything very concrete will arise from all this.

Local purchases: British and American authorities realise fully that.local purchases in Persia must be restricted to indispensable minimum. The Americans meet higher proportion of their needs from abroad than we do. They buy no meat locally and have only recently begun to make local purchases of fresh vegetables. A local purchase committee on which British and American authorities are represented considers all proposals for bulk purchases by either of them. Purchases by Polish Refugees Administration.were, recently brought to within its scope. Closest touch is.main tained with Doctor Millspaugh(s Price Stabilisation Section. The Soviets have never co-operated in these arrangements and have always preferred to apply direct to employees of Persian Government and to submitting to Persia rather than to the Americans for their requirements. .There is no doubt that they have also made large purchases of rice, sheep, cattle, etc. v/ithout consulting the Persian Government. A few days ago, however, Soviet Trade representative discussed with Acting Commercial Secretary the possibility of joint purchases of vegetables by British and Russian military authorities in the Tehran area and it is hoped that this may indicate a change of.policy.

Fleet of Lend-Lea.se and ccntre.cted vonicles now under control of the Persian Government Road Transport Department is adequate only for cereals collection and part of civilian oil and coal lift.

At the suggestion of Middle East Supplies Centre, Persian Government Working Committee was formed to discuss supply and transport problems with Executive Committee of Combined Supplies Committee hut after two meetings many months ago Persians dropped matters - possibly because they were asked to produce figures in support of their contention that all quotas were grossly inadequate and failed to do so. .again at our M \ instance Government of. India, by a derogation from their policy of allowing trade to flow through private channels, kindly granted to Persian Government four fifths of Persian quota of cotton piece goods; this was over 6 months ago and the Persian Government have bought nothing. Government of India rightly wish to cancel the arrangement. It must be remembered that even if the Persians secured more goods there would remain the difficulties in [sic] of fair distribution - a problem with which American advisers are struggling with a lack .of success which is due almost entirely to the shortage of American staff and complete unreliability and dishonesty of Persian politicians and officials.

There can of course be no question of our agreeing to proposal for by-passing of M.E.S.C. and we will explain to H. why this would be against Persian interests hs well as our own. Nevertheless, for reasons given in my telegram under reference, we should like if possible to make some counter-suggestion which Persian Government could represent as concession to their point of view. The Persian Legation here have for some time been 'making complaints (e.g. regarding allegedly inadequate quotas allotted to Persia and slowness of M.E.S.C. procedure) which we have hitherto been able to fend off. But this is the first time that Persian Government have protested against ItE.S.C. system as such. 2. You have already foreseen that Middle Eastern countries are likely to chafe increasingly under M.E.S.C. restrictions and have made proposals to meet this difficulty. These proposals will, however, take some time to mature and in the case of Persia there is the added difficulty that there are objections i to her eventual inclusion in Middle East Economic Council, both because Persia does not normally form part of Middle East economic bloc and because inclusion of Persia might produce Russian demand for representation. We cannot therefore hold out even a remote hope to Persian Government on this score. Of the measures hitherto considered, the only immediately practicable one is representation of Persia at economic conferences arranged by M.E.S.C. I understand that a start has already been made with this. 3. I should be grateful if you will consider urgently whether there is anything more that can be done either in Cairo or at Tehran end to satisfy Persian Government's wish to have a greater than hitherto in supply questions affecting their interests. &lt;w!=.OUTWARD TELEGRAM c [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and shouid be kept under Lock and Key.] (E 5621/82/34) [CYPHER] 5 5 “'' * “*7 i O 't f S DEP,iRTiViEllT^L i mwm ■-! nw i ■ — i ■ .. ■ i .i r ■■ ■ !■ » ■ •FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN No : 8/8 D. 11. 10 p.m* Isi; October, 194-3. 1st October, 194-3.

IMPORTANT 11111 Persian Minister of Communications has now sent in memorandum on internal conditions and Allied policy in Persia. Copies of memorandum, which is long and detailed, are being sent by bag to you, Minister of State, Washington and Moscow. 2. Most important proposals, with which we wish to deal at once, are the following:- (a) that there should be constituted at Tehran a tripartite committee consisting of Britain, Persian and Russian members, at which we and the Russians would state our requirements and Persian Government would say what they considered to be the necessary means of fulfilling them. Object of committee would be avoidance of independent action and of direct reference to different departments of Persian' Government by various allied authorities, and 1 achievement of general co-ordination of xillied policy in Persia, which Hajhir claims is essential in order to re-establish authority of Persian Government in the eyes of the country and to enable them to plan ahead; (b) that there should be reference direct to London of all questions v/hich cannot be settled expeditiously | in Tehran. (.Hajhir does not say exactly what he has in mind, but this proposal is presumably aimed at Middle East Supply Centre, about which Hajhir has complained in conversation). 3. As regards (a), I note that immediately after the occupation you yourself favoured some such scheme (your f v 7-, * ^ ‘ telegram No. 84-3 of [September 24-th] 194-1). But conditions have meanwhile changed greatly a.nd there would obviously be danger in /&gt; V ( 2 ) in setting up a body to which the Persians would be able to refer all allied requirements, irrespective of their •• nature or whom they concerned;; on which they wished to avoid immediate action* The fact that Russian representative would generally lack authority to reach decisions would contribute further to delay. On the other hand, there would seem*no objection, especially now that Persia is a belligerent, to our agreeing in principle... (sub ject of course to Soviet concurrence) to a procedure by which any specific questions of common cor;com to Persia, Russia and ourselves would be discussed in Tehran by representatives of all three Powers whenever this appeared desirable* H. does not suggest • American participation, but this would also have to be considered and would presumably be desirable. 1. H. no doubt hopes to gain concessions of substance if he can. But our strong impression is that he is at least equally concerned with appearances, and that he hopes to obtain our consent to arrangements which could be represented by Persian Government to liajlis and public opinion as confirming Persia's status, as an equal partner and as evidence that Persia was being consulted in Allied deliberations. In general, we think it would be well to meet his requests in this respect so far as we can, since it will presumably react badly on Persian Government's position if IL appears to return empty-handed. 5, I should be grateful for your views as soon as possible on the foregoing, and also on oroncs^l (b), as to which please see my telegram No, 3062 to Minister of State.

I now have pleasure in enclosing Monsieur Hagir’s memorandum. Monsieur Hagir has’, in the little time at his disposal, tried to give an outline of the various outstanding questions, and he will be at Your Excellency's disposal to-elucidate any points which may require more detail. I am sure that the contents of the memorandum will, as Your Excellency so kindly promised, receive your personal perusal and attention. Believe me, etc., (3gd.) S.H. Taqizadeh. The Right Hon. Anthony Eden, M.Cf., M.P., His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, S.W.l.As was briefly explained in the coarse of the preliminary conversations between the Iranian Minister of Communications and Mr. Richard Law, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Sir Maurice Peterson, the Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the reasons and purposes for the journey of Monsieur Hagir to England were as follows:- In view of the many difficulties which beset the Iranian Government in the fulfillment of their task, a major part of which are, in their opinion, due to apparent lack of harmony or perhaps a clear policy in the functioning of collaboration of the Allied Powers, Great Britain and Soviet Russia, with Iran, and in view of the fact that, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Iranian Government and the unquestionable goodwill of the British authorities, the complete removal of the difficulties in question as well as a definite clarification of the situation and the establishment of a perfect understanding between Iran and the other parties has not so far materialised; and since a complete analysis of the situation to the Iranian Minister in London by correspondence was found to be impossible^ the Iranian Govern ment therefore felt it would be to the mutual interest of both countries if a member of the Iranian Cabinet, fully conversant with current affairs and existing difficulties and problems and who could suggest possible ways and means of their solution, pay an unofficial visit to London to explain matters to the Iranian Minister on the one hand, and to try to establish personal contact with members of the British Government and competent British authorities on the other, with a view to discussing with them the best means of removing existing difficulties. Consequently the Iranian Government requested the Minister of Communications to undertake this trip. The British Minister at Tehran, who was informed and consulted in the matter, was all for it, and expressed the opinion that it would be very helpful and beneficial. Monsieur Hagir forthwith left Tehran by air, and arrived in London on 12th August, 1943. After exchanging views with Mr. S.H* Taqisadeh, the Iranian Minister in London, he had preliminary talks v/ith Mr. Richard Law and Sir Maurice Peterson of the Foreign Office, The suggestion was made at both these talks that a resume of the questions to be discussed be put in writing so that they may be considered before further discussions take place. Endeavour has been made br ief ly to enumerate hereunder the difficulties and problems as well as their possible solutions, and the methods by which it is hoped a better measure of collaboration during the war and afterwards may be established between Iran and Great Britain* Since Iran’s policy of neutrality in the present conflict was practically ended in August, 1941, and when as a result of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance of-29th January, 1942, the basis of collaboration between Iran and the Allied Powers was /founded,♦ /policy founded, the Iranian Government have done all in their power to carry out loyally in letter as well as in spirit all their undertakings towards the Allies and to consolidate this friendship more and more each day (see Enclosure No. l). They have spared no effort in this direction, so much so that in certain cases they have carried out far more than their share of undertakings in order that from a practical point of view the Allies may be assured of the goodv/ill and desire of the Iranian Government in cementing and broadening the basis of the good relations between Iran and the Allied Powers (see Enclosure No. 2). But in the course of carrying out this policy, the basis of which has been from the beginning the co-ordination of Iran’s interests with those of the Allied Pov/ers, and in the adoption and execution of which the Iranian Government have always had the fullest confidence in the good faith of the Allies, especially the friendship of Great Britain towards Iran - and it may be added that this confidence and hope is in no way impaired - a situation has been gradually created in Iran which renders the task of the Itanian Government more and more arduous each day. In the opinion of the Iranian Government most of these difficulties have arisen from the fact that some of the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance have not at times been carried out fully by the Allies as expected (see Enclosure No. 3). So much so that Iran’s situation during the last two years can best be summarised in:- 1 - The ever-increasing difficulties, both political and econorr '' 0 of the country and the many hardships of the people.. 2 - The failure of the Iranian Government in their constant efforts to secure the vital requirements of the people and to consolidate the authority of the Government. The grave consequences which these ’’difficulties and failure” entail for the present and future conditions of Iran, and which have therefore become the subject of careful study and great attention by the Iranian Government, must also inevitably have occupied the close attention of the Allied Powers not only from the point of view of the present collaboration in accordance with the Treaty of Alliance for the duration of the war, but also from the point of view of the long-term post-war neighbourly relations of our countries. The origin and cause of these ’’difficulties and failure ’’ 5 ir so far as they relate to the internal affairs of Iran, is a different subject. Here it is intended to analyse primarily the prevailing conditions in Iran as affected bj” the relations the Allies have had v/ith Iran during the last two years, and perhaps to suggest ways and means of solving 'Che problems that present themselves. These conditions are dealt with at some length in Enclosure No. 4, where, so far as possible, full details of a good many branches of administration are given and the original cause and present state of affairs are separately discussed. The general position is however that consequent to the even'.s of August 1941, most of the links which up to that date had connected the national and administrative machinery of Iran, suddenly broke up, and great difficulties were experienced in replacing them by a new general method to reconstruct the administration and organisation of the country. Apart from thepolicy of collaboration with the Allies, in furtherance of their purposes, other vital problems of Iran found little scope for development or permanency« The Iranian Government, in addition to co-operation with the Allied Powers, had to determine other principles of the internal policy of the country, and in considering these requirements in their various aspects, to co-ordinate them in such a manner that Iran might benefit from loyal collaboration with the Allies and in turn render effective assistance to the Allied Powers. But unfortunately this has not so far been achieved. For in the last two years it has not been quite clear to the Iranian Government what the Allied Powers expect precisely and concretely from Iran in so far as relates to Iran's collaboration v/ith them. Moreover, the Iranian Government has not as yet been given the opportunity to place once and for all before the Allied Powers the difficulties and essential needs of Iran, in order that representatives of the three countries (Iran, Great Britain and the U.S.S.R.) may sit at a table and co-ordinate' the v/ishes of the Allied Powers v/ith the essential needs of the country as well as with the sovereign rights of Iran, and at the same time to draw up plans for the implementation of this aim on the basis of complete collaboration. Thus, when the point purposes and the methods of achieving them are determined, the Iranian Govern ment would undertake the responsibility of carrying out their share of the plan towards the country and the Allies. The course which has, however, frequently been followed has been that the requirements of the Allied Pov/ers, most of them presenting themselves suddenly, are submitted gradually as required, and every time the Iranian Government have endeavoured to carry them out, since no previous planning has been made for the removal of the difficulties v/ith which they are inevitably bound, the execution of these requirements often comes up against impediments, or becomes protracted, and has apparently given rise to some dissatisfaction on the part of the Allies. In certain cases the Allied Powers have deemed it advisable to take direct measures in Iran, thereby causing the people to complain, and as the Government of Iran have been unable to give a satisfactory reply to these complaints, this has added increasingly.to the weakness of the administration. The sum total of incidents of this kind resulted in depletion of the authority of the armed forces and gendarmerie in establishing law and order, in shrinkage of the revenue of the Government, and owing to the rise in the cost of living and other difficulties, in thwarting the officials of the Government in carrying out their duties. Thus the elements v/hich in other countries constitute the instruments of administration have become weaker in Iran, and through considerable rise in the cost of living, scarcity of commodities, privation, insecurity and disease, every class of the populace without exception has become despondent and constantly blame the Government for all these shortcomings and failures. This all resulted in the Allied Powers increasing their continued interference, in proportion to the ever-increasing weakening of the Iranian administration, and this in turn was a further effective,contribution to the weakening of the Government* This vicious circle went on and on, and still continues. In the /circumstancesIn the circumstances, the Iranian Government consider the ultimate outcome of this vicious circle, from the point of view of Iran f s interests as well as that of the Allied Powers, and particularly Great Britain, as grave, and can see the only solution in the immediate strengthening of the administration of Iran and its establishment on a solid and sound basis. This strengthening is undoubtedly to the interest of the Allied Powers, and the Iranian Government feel that the British Government are sincerely desirous that it should be attained* The carrying out of this plan is, however, contingent on the steadfast help of the Allied Powers, and particularly the whole hearted assistance and moral support of the British Government* This is an essential condition to enable the Iranian Government to proceed with carrying out their plans with full confidence* The necessary support and assistance may be outlined as follows:' (a) That the British Government may make necessary arrangements so that all problems in question affecting Iran which cannot be solved in Tehran be referred direct to London and not to any other intermediary authority which may have boon temporarily set up for dealing with various matters. This would immediately alleviate many of the difficulties, and the facilities and support thereby accorded to the Iranian Government would render great assistance m their administrative functions. The present procedure, where each representative of various British departments independently deals with the relevant problems, and before a decision can be reached or the matter can be referred to London a good deal of time is takep in departmental routine, has not been found by the Iranian Government helpful in obtaining a speedy and definite decision in many cases. (b) That the officials of the Allied Powers may base their actions in Iran on the principles of collaboration as envisaged 1 in the Treaty of Alliance and strictly avoid actions which may have the least semblance of interference, and in order to reach a satisfactory execution of their wishes from Iran to discuss them on the basis of collaboration and mutual assistance with the Iranian Government, keeping in mind the consequences which may ensue, and to determine with the help of the Iranian Government the means of carrying them out, and even for example in the matter of supply of their needs (purchases, etc.) not to refer direct to the market but to come to an arrangement with the Iranian Govern ment. Failing the adoption and realisation of all the procedure described above, the relations between Iran and the Allied Powers can hardly be termed as ’’collaboration^. A practicable way of realising this may be to submit the questions relating to the desired collaboration provided m the Treaty or arising out the exigencies of circumstances, to a committee composed of the representatives of the Iranian Govern ment and of the Allied Powers, who should study the matters fully and propose, with the full cigreement of the Iranian Government, ways and means for meeting the wishes of the Aj-xies in Ir^n in ^ ^ full. This would seem to be helpful in facilitating the expeeioious execution of all the measures found necessary. The same procedure should naturally apply to the questions raised by the Iranian Govern ment, and the Allies should in these cwm-s immediately appoint their representatives to consider the matters with the representatives 01 the Iranian Government. Each representative in the projected committee would certainly be free in each case to call upon his technical advisers to assist him. Two further conditions for the effectiveness of this method and its fruitfulness are that, -irs y 9 C.H/all necessary steps in the way of securing the requirements of , the Allies must be taken exclusively by the central Government or Iran or competent Iranian authorities on their orders, without any necessity for any official of the Allied Powers to apply . direct to the different departments in Iran; and secondly that all the Allied authorities, civil, military, etc., should unhesitatingly abide by the decisions reached through the discussions of the committee and through mutual agreement, and that no official of the Allied Governments, taking orders from special headquarters of their respective Governments, should cause impediments in the speedy execution of measures decided upon to alleviate the difficulties- of the Iranian Government. If this suggestion meets in principle with the agreement of the Allied Powers as well as of the Iranian Government, the particulars of implementation and the limits of the authority of the representatives of the three Governments can bo determined separately. (c) That the British Government may render effective assistance so that the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance which have been ignored or not observed by some officials of the Allied Powers should bo respected and observed in future, and thus avoid repetition of any action or measure taken so far by any Allied officials or their agents which did not conform with the territorial integrity or the complete administrative military economic and financial unity of Iran, or her independence and sovereignty, and did not adequately take into consideration the needs of Iran, or had disturbed more than necessary the admin istration, security forces, economic life and the passenger traffic of the country and the application of the laws and regulations of Iran. (d) The Iranian Government hope that the carrying out of the clauses of the Treaty of Alliance relating to agreements to determine the financial obligations of the Allied Powers in Iran, the safeguard of the economic existence of Iranians against the privations and difficulties of war, the immunities enjoyed by the armed forces of the Allied Powers in Iran, and the conditions for transfer to the Iranian Government after the war of building and other improvements effected by the Allied Powers on Iranian territory, would receive immediate attention by the British Government and the Allied Powers would appoint their respective representatives for conducting negotiations and the signing’of the above-mentioned agreements. It may be added that the conclusion of these agreements is considered of such import ance that it lii firmly believed that without them the deterior-^ ation of the financial, administrative and military affairs of the Iranian Government as well as the economic and currency questions of the people, their means of livelihood and the essentials of the life of the nation, will be aggravated daily. To conclude these agreements, the assets ;:nd capacity of Iran (including banknote issue.^ ^ State, revenue, foreign exchange, precious metals, agricultural, mining and industrial products, means of transport and the capacity of arms factories) as well as the needs of the Allied Powers in Iran (in respect of cash, and goods for use, export and transport, etc.) and the minimum needs of the people of Iran in respect of home-made and imported goods, the level of prices, Lend-Lease aid, etc., and the minimum requirements of the Government to organise the machinery of administration and establish order and security all over the country through equipping and organising the policing forces and real stability in the finances and industrial and agric ultural needs of state institutions, should altogether/r.ltogethor be given full consideration, and necessary arrangements be reached on a basis of sincere and complete collaboration so that the just share of each party be duly assigned and the rights of each party be met fairly --nd' squ rely. Before these problems are determined and the necessary agreements concluded, no steps can be taken for the amelioration of the situation in Iran. Even if Dr. Killispaugh were to tackle every problem that presented itself and refer on each matter to the Iranian Government or ask for the submitting of a new Bill to the Parliament or certain financial assistance from the Allied Governments, all his efforts, if not proceeded by the above agreements will, it is feared, bo doomed to failure, particularly as Dr. Millispaugh cannot make long-term plans, whilst the present economic and financial situation of Iran is so strained that the burden on the people generally is getting more and mope intolerable• In the negotiations for the above-mentioned agreements, it is of great importance to bear in mind that in many cases, particularly questions affecting the increase of the means of the productive capacity of Iran, such as roads, railways, factories mines, or relating to the note issue, foreign exchange and precious metals, etc., two stages can at the some time be envisaged, and from now two plans can be drawn up, one for the duration of war and one for post-war (which may be far more important from the point of view of the British Government). It is believed that the conclusion of one of the agreements referred to above, namely that concerning roads, railways and ports, will be easier than the others because its draft agreement was prepared sixteen months ago in Tehran and submitted, and in case the competent authorities of the British Government consider certain negotiat ions necessary, it is not thought that it would take much longer in London to complete these negotiations. (e) The Iranian Government have, ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance, carried out loyally all their share of obligations with the expectation that the allied Powers would, in their relations with Iran as well as in all international decisions, recognise the right of Iran as equal to the right which is, or may be, accorded to other Allied nations. Part icularly as there are amongst the associated countries of the Allied Powers some who have suffered far less hardship and privations from the war than Iran; moreover since the course of events has surely proved that Iran is the safest and most secure connecting link between the Allies and that Iran has done her best to aid and further the Allied cause, the Iranian Government feel confident that the Allied Powers in all their discussions and negotiations relating to peace a.nd post-war problems of the world, whether under consideration now or arising after the cessation of hostilities, will extend similar invitations to them as those extended to other Allied nations and associates. It was a source of satisfaction, and proof of the sincere sentiments of the allies in extending an invitation.to the Iranian Government to participate in the United 'Nations Food Conference held at Hot Springs. Nevertheless, the Iranian Government would welcome a formal assurance by the Allied Powers on this point.At the same time the Iranian Government hope strongly that the British Government will demonstrate effectively their sincere interest in the strength and stability of Iran and thus counteract the notion ^.ained in some (planters, and particularly in Iran itself, that they no longer cherish the same age-old sentiments towards Iran or that their interests may have been weakened. In the opinion of the Iranian Government, one of the measures contributing to the demonstration of goodwill would, at this juncture, be the promotion of the diplomatic representative of His Britannic Majesty’s Government in Iran to Ambassadorship (keeping in mind the fact that the rank of the three diplomatic representative of the three neighbours of Iran is that of an Ambassador). Of similar significance mi 0 ht be the courtesy visit, or one of any nature that may be deemed advisable, of a high-standing British statesman to Iran. Once the above measures are carried out by the Allied Governments, it would reassure a good many people in Iran who are very much disturbed over the present situation of the country and have great anxiety for its future. Secondly, the Government will be in a position to place at the disposal of the 400,000 Civil Servants who form the bulk of the educated class of the country, the essential needs of life which they have found lacking for some time owing to the enormous rise in the cost of living. Thirdly, the minimum requirements of the people in respect of bread, rice, sugar, tea, meat, wood, charcoal, piece-goods, medicine and soap would be supplied in due course and arrangements would be made for fair distribution, and in this way the comparative comfort of the people in regard to everyday life would be secured. Fourthly, as a result of securing the needs of the Army by the conclusion of the aforesaid agreement and the removal of the interferences which have so far disturbed, the administration of the Army, the Government will be in a position to organise the armed forces of the country, as it is obvious that Iran like other countries, cannot exist without the possession of armed forces, and obviously these armed forces must be proportionate to the fiancial strength and the true needs of the country from the point of view of numbers, organisation, good administration, munitions and other requirements, and from the point of view of administration they must remain stable and strong and, in accordance v;ith the constitutional laws of the country, must confine themselves to their military duties and not become involved in the fluctuating political currents of the country, and the supply' of their expenditure and needs must be secured. Under* suclh conditions . the American experts were invited to c^me to Iran last, year and will draw up and execute plans for the reform of the Army and its training and the formation of security forces and the police forces of the country, thus establishing security &amp;11 over the country when Government revenue can be regularly collected. The result of these measures will be to strengthen increasingly the authority jof the Government mortally ras well a ? S materially, and accordingly public opinion will support the Government more and more and this authority and opportunity wiil provide the Government of Iran with the means of doing more rnd a more each day in the way cf collaboration and co-operation with 1 ^ the Allied Powers, and in the post-war period would, by carrying rut the financial and economic plans drawn up now and on the groundwork prepared, bring Iran much closer to the Allied Powers' and improve the existing cordial relations, resulting to the mutual/mutual interest of our countries and the implernen. at ion of the contemplated reforms for Iran. These are the leading points embracing the future plan of the Iranian Government, who are convinced th. t if they are all put into effect they will form a general and comprehensive policy that can only be achieved through sincere collaboration of the British Government and Iran, and which will increase the good feeling of the Iranian people towards the Allied Powers, and in particular towards Great Britain, and will secure the means of strengthening the independence and the integrity of Iran at present and in future. To elucidate details of these suggestions and to clear up any other points that may be necessary, all the desired information can be furnished in London, and any negotiations which are repaired can be carried out immediately. Obviously, in negotiations in respect of the essentials of the above-mentioned general policy, the question of solving each item can, if desired, be taken up with the various Ministries and departments. Another essential point which should be mentioned is that in this policy of collaboration and good-neighbourliness, whatever has been, mentioned here are problems that have been tabulated from the point of view of needs of the Iranian Government, but in order that the basis of friendship and collaboration may be strengthened on Doth sides, the Iranian Government is particularly desirous that the British Government put forward in detail 'whatever they expect from Iran during the war or after ards, naturally within Iran’s capability ana always compatible with the terms of the first Article of the Tre?ty of Alliance. It is hoped that in supplying the Iranian Government with details of the wishes of the British Government, these wishes can be planned for and carried out, and that with such an arrangement no problems that could create any misunderstanaing or difference of opinion could exist in the future, and that both parties will loyally carry out whatever they have undertaken* If, after consideration of the above facts the British Government, in view of the goodwill they have always in the past as well as now expressed for Iran, adopt a clear general policy towards Iran, the Iranian Government will with appreciation and satisfaction do whatever is necessary immediately so that the definite plans as outlined above may be drawn up as soon as possible and carried out with the agreement of both parties. It is then certain that both parties will benefit from its advantages both during the war and afterwards. It should, however, be added that what has been mentioned here is purely an attempt to prepare the _roundwork for negotiations, but if the British Government would like to make alternative proposals which they believe will take the parties more quickly and closer to their aims, the Iranian Government will certainly consider the suggestions and the Iranian minister of Communications is prepared to offer his assistance in bridging the suggestions into a concrete form. Iran's confidence in the goodwill and sincere sentiments of the British Government is so firm that she feels the above explanation will be full, studied by the competent British authorities who will assuredly give sympathetic and favourable consideration to the solution of all these difficulties, and will contribute effectively to establish a stable policy in the relations of the two countries, as the continuation of the present situation and failure to reach a solution can only lead to further chaos' and will hardly encourage the nation and Government of Iran to adopt a stable and contructive policy.■^nolosure N o,l. To illustrate the ^oodwill and soiri-t- of lo^cl co-operc tion shown b^. the Iranian dcvermnent end authorities for facilitating fae work of the Allies in Iran, the following three cases are mentioned:- (1) oir iveoder Bullard, the British Minister at Tehran, on the 27th April, 1943, forwarded to the Iranian Ministry of Communications copy of a letter from the G.0oC.British forces, in which he recorded*the high opinion which he hod formed of the excellent v;ork done by the Iranian railway officials and employees and by officers of the Tehran central Arsenal during the period when the railway was administered by the British military authorities• ( 2 ) The various lines of the Iranian Railways have, during the period August 1941 to march 1943, transported over 900,000 tons of British, American and Russian ^oods. In forwarding war mate rials from the Persian Gulf destined for Russia, the Railways have worked so regularly and satisfactorily that at present there are about 60,000 tons of war mate rials and foodstuffs lying at Bandar Shah on the Caspian Sea, awaiting shipment to Russia, and the Soviet authorities lack means of expeditiously shipping them. Moreover, about 30,000 tons of similar goods are lying in different local ities along the railway line in the regions of the north of lehr an (shahi - Sari - Firooz .,ooh, etc.). Furthermore, as more ^oods are constantly forwarded from the Persian Gulf and there are few facilities for storage en route, a store-house is in process of construction in Tehran which will hold 60,000 tons. The above-mentioned figures exclude the tonnage forwarded during the last two years through Chaussee roads by lorries from southern ports and western Iran to Russia. (3) During the last two ..ears, the Iranian Railways with the assistance of the Allies, have increased their freight capacity from the Persian Gulf every day. On July 24th, 1943, a net total of 6,214 tons were discharged in twnenty-four hours (gross tonnage of 9,450 tons) and transport from the Persian Gulf to Tehran.Eiiclgburs No* 2. illustrate the fact that Iran has carried out more ^than her share of undertakings in accordance with the Treaty of Alliance^ and to-prove her friendship for the Allies, the following example may he cited:- According to Annex 2 of the treaty of Alliance, the Iranian Government agreed that they ^would consider it contrary to their obligations* •••••••••••••to maintain diplomatic relations witn any State which is in diplomatic relations with neither of the Allied Powers'* But although the Soviet Government still maintain; diplomatic relations with Japan, nevertheless', in order to please Great Britain and the United States of America, diplomatic relations of Iran with Japan were broken off.Enclosure No. 5' To indicate hov; the Treaty of Alliance, in the^ opinion of the Iranian Government, has not functioned fully, the iollouiny illustrations are given:- 1. Article 1 of the Treaty stipulates that tho Allied Powers ''jointly and severally undertake to respect the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence oi Iran 1 «. Prom the terms of this article, as v/oll as from tne long standing interest which the Allied Governments, and particularr Great Britain, have manifested in the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Iran, the Iranian Government conclude firstly that Iran from the administrative point oi view remains an indivisible unit under one- central direction at Tehran; secondly, that whatever the Allied Govern ments, in virtue of co-operation, mutual interests, iiiendsnip^ and neighbourliness, expect from Iran, shoulo. do discussed vich the Iranian Government and before any stops are taken towards ^ them, the views of the Iranian Government should be consideied on a basis of collaboration, and the decision bo og oaken should be in full agreement of all parties concerned, ana then the execution of these decision left to the Iranian Government without interference from Allied ofiicials; thirdly, that in^ every measure taken by the Allied Governments in every part o^ Iran, the responsibility and guarantee for the conformity o± _ that measure with the sovereignty and independence of Iran shoul - be with the two Allied Powers jointly and severally. But t .0 Iranian Government regret to say that during ^cnis. period matters have not limctjonedsatisfactorily, and collaborao. has not been interpreted in the above-mentioned spirit. On one contran , many instances can do cited when the Iranian Govern ment, though willing to ive the benefit of the doubt ^ conceinm, their conformity with the integrity, sovereignty and independenc of Iran, has been unable to do so. For instance: (a) The northern and southern provinces of Iran are not administered as a single whole under the direction of tne centre.. Government, and tho efforts of the Iranian Government to centrev ise the administrative, economic and military affairs of those two parts on one basis under direction from Tehran have not be .a successful. Avon the traffic of- passengers and ^oods from. one part to another meets with restrictions, as if the various parts of Iran must necessarily live separately from the point of view of administration, economics, otc. (b) The despatch of armed forces and gendarmerie to nox-theri parts cannot bo carried out without restriction of.arms and ammunition imposed by the Soviet authorities, and in any case no forces can he despatched to those districts unless their acquiescence has been obtained beforehand. The numoer of oOlaie. and officers cannot be increased ev are stationed. They cannot bo moved about, a regrettable case of the gendarmerie being Azerbaye jan. in in the area in which they There has even been disarmed in (c) The Allied armies proceed to and stay in any part of country they desire, a good many being regularly seen in end around the capital. Though in Article 4 (i) it has been stipulated that 'The Allied Powers may maintain in Iranian the territory/(3&gt; territory land, sea and air forces in such numbers as they consider necessary. The location of such forces shall be decided in agreement v/ith the Iranian Government so lony as the strategic situation allows” no such agreement has been asked for from Iran unless it is to be assumed that there is no part of- Iran which is not considered as a 'strategic point”. (d) Certain measures taken by Allied officials in various branches of the internal affairs of 'Iran (such as buying and selling goods, ordering goods, various transactions, hiring means of transport, etc. ) and operated without co?isulting the Iranian Government beforehand or conforming them to the general policy of the country have, instead of acts of collaboration, assumed the shape of interference. This has in certain instances oven been extended to all details and minor parts of the affairs of the country, and obviously it has not helped to enhance the prestige of the Government. (e) The respecting of the laws of Iran, which forms an integral part of the observation of Iranian independence and sovereignty, though it has been aptly omphLsised in Article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance vherc it is clearly stipul .ted shat 'the presence of these forces on Iranian terr itory •J.oos not constitute a military occupation and will disturb as little as possible the administration and the security forces of Iran, the economic life of the country, the normal movements of the population and the application of Iranian la&gt; a anc regulations”, is not duly heeded, for example the Customs laws and regulations are often not observed. (f) as Article 1 of the Treat;-/ or alliance stipulates that the Allied Powers jointly and severally undertake to respect the territorial into- rrty, soverei nty and political independence of Iran- , therefore tlr. opinion of the Iranian Government is that the non-observance of this ouli ation by one of the Allied Cover rime ires justifies the Iranian Government in a skin - the other si. natory to the treat, to intervene with a view to taking effective measures to put the matte: ht. Nevertheless on every such occasion 'hen soviet officials have failed to observe the terms of this Article, the british Government on be in. approached have referred the Iranian Government to direct negotiations with the soviet Government, as if the respecting of the sovereignty and independence of Iran by the .Hied Powers, as provided in the Treaty of Alliance, has been ua,. antes a. severally and not jointly. 2. According to paragraph (iir) of Article 3 of the Treaty of Alliance, the Hired Po ierc have :en to 'give full com. iuera*cion -I-1. ;o the essential needs o: Iran” in connexion with use they make 01 me communications or me courier In this connexion many instances can be given when the essential require ments of Iran have not during the past two years been adequately met. In the opinion of the Iranian Government, an arran ement to secure the views of the mrea signatories of the Treaty of Alliance, as stipulated in the Treat/', and to fix the duties, responsibilities of them, is essential. to clarify the situation and ojII: at ions of each 3. Accor dint to . article 4 , ” . separate agreement or agreements shall bo concluded as soon as possible after the entry into force of the present Treaty regardin any financial ooli ations to be borne by the Allied lowers” *ith regard to different matters referred to in the said . .,rtrcle. do far no such agreement 'regarding any financial obi I ..at ions to be oorne by the Allied Po we r s/Powers' as provided in the Treaty has been concluded, while the only agreement bearing the name of a Financial Agreement that has been concluded with each of the Allied Governments had for its main purpose to secure Rials under c rtain conditions for allied requirements. The Iranian Government believe that now that the financial situation of Iran is beset with many difficulties, it seems an opportune moment to conclude, as expeditiously as possible, the agreements provided for in the Treaty, in order to ease the financial situation of Iran and to determine the financial obligations of the Allied Powers. 4, Article 4, Section (ii) of the Treaty of Alliance stipulates that the projected agreements referred to in this Article shn 1 also settle the immunities to be enjoyed by the forces of the Allied Powers in Iran', tut so far no such agreements have been concluded, and the forces of the Allied Powers consider themselves exempt from payment of taxes and all charges. Furthermore, t ^y do not consider themselves as coming under the jurisdiction of the Iranian Police authorities or the Courts of Law. In cases when as a result of motor vehicle accidents or any inadvertent actions of the Allied forces in Iran, financial or physical loss is sustained by Iranian citizens, or accidents result in death, either the perpetrator altogether escapes discovery and the case is not pursued, or some monetary compensation, quite incompatible with the damage caused, is paid over to the third party. - s has naturally given rise to serious complaints by the people. 5, Article 7 of the Treaty of Alliance states that 'The Allied Powers jointly undertake to use their best endeavours to sa^eguar the economic existence of the Iranian people against the privations nnd difficulties arising as a result of the present war. On the entry into force of the present Treaty, discussions shall he opened between the Government of Iran and the Governments of the Allied Powers as to the best possible methods of carrying out the above undertaking'. The Iranian Government believe that if the terms of this Article of the Treaty of Alliance, which calls for immediate implementation, had been put into operation immediately after the signing of the Treaty, a good many of the complaints in connection with fundamentals of the economic requirements of the country might not have arisen. Out of the agreements envisaged in this Article of the Treaty, the only one concluded so far is the agreement appertaining to the delivery of * 0,000 tons of wheat. But unfortunately the two economic projects prepared oy,the Iranian Government on the basis of the above-mentioned Article oi the Treaty and submitted to the British Government on November 12 th, 1942, were not accepted even as a basis of negotiations, . no counter-proposals have been submitted to the Iranian TOVcrn.t The Iranian Government is however of the opinion that the greater speed and urgency given to the implementation yf the t rms of this Article of the Treaty, just as quickly will the ever-increasing difficulties of Iran he helped towards solution and the basis of collaboration of Iran ^ith the allied Powers he strengthened. G. The British and Soviet Governments, according to Article 6 (l) of the Treaty of Alliance have undertaken to consult the Iranian Government 'in all matters affecting the direct interest- of Iran'. However, without the previous knowledge of the Iranian Government, Colonel Stoddard of the U.S. Array on the 26th November, 1942, called at the Ministry of Communications requesting that American officials be allowed to make certain studies/studies in the Iranian Railways, and afterwards op rate there. Following this, the U.S. Minister at Tehran and General Connolly of the American forces called at the Ministry of Communications with the request that permission be granted to armed officials of the U.G.A. to operate in the administration of the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway and certain ports and roads which up to that date were run by the officials of the British Government. The Minister of Communications, being unable to prevent this entrance of the armed officials of the U.S./v. into Iran and their interference in the administration of the railways and ports, contented himself in reminding the U.S. Minister at Tehran that in accordance with Articles of the Treaty of Alliance, the acquiescence of the Governments of Great Britain and Soviet Russia would be necessary. On December 6 th, 1942, the U.S. minister at Tehran wrote to the minister for Foreign Affairs that the U.S. and British Governments had agreed that American military officials should take over the administration of the souths rn sections of the Trans-Iranian Railway as well as the administration of certain ports and other organisations appertaining to transport, etc. On December 7th, 1942, the British Minister at Tehran informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in a Note that 'H.B.m.'s Government and. the Government of the U.S. , in view of partnership and collaboration in th, war effort of the Allies, are handing over to U.S. officials the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway from the'ports of the Persian Gulf to Tehran'. Although the U.S, minister in his previous letter had stipulated that 'v ? ith regard to the various phases of transfer it may be added that they are under consideration and details will be discussed later on', and the British Minister had also stated that 'details of transfer and the date have not as yet been fixed', armed forces of the U.S..A. not only did not wait for these preliminaries, but immediately took over the southern section of the railway to Tehran as well as occupying the roads and ports of Khuzistan, which were not even referred to in the note of the British Minister. ,v hilst not recognising an 3 ^ limitations or restrictions in the technical or administrative affairs of their interference, the U.S. officials have carried out whatever they deemed necessary, and are continuing this. In cases when on account of loss of life or rape of Iranian citizens on the part of junior American officials, criticisms and questions have been asked in the Press and Parliament and the Government has been asked to explain Y'ith what right armed forces of the U.A.A. have entered Iran and interfered, the Iranian Government have been unable to give any satisfactory reply. Furthermore, the Iranian Government have received scant answer to their repeated inquiries to the U.S. forces, who maintain that they are the successors of the British forces. The impression gained is that the? r consider any kind of discussion and projected agreement as to the principle and limits of their interference in Iranian belongings as essentially superflous and waste of time. The Soviet .embassy in Tehran, for the benefit of whose country the roads of Iran are being used, when approached in accordance with the Treaty of Alliance to express their views concerning the entrjr of U.S. forces into Iraxi, did not reply until .July 26th, 1943, and on that date wrote to .the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that in the opinion of the Soviet Lmbassy the measures taken by the armed forces of the U.S.A. in Iran were confined to/confined to 'the zone occupied by the British forces in Iran and 'is taking place under the general management of the eritisn , and 'in view of the fact that according to the special ^ ^ arrangement v 7 hich exists between Great Britain and t e &gt; * control of the northern section of the Trans-Iranian Railways rests with the Goviet authorities and the British authorities control the southern section the f ^tish do not constitute independent units but are parts of the. rit armed forces of Iran and Iraq'. The Iranian Government is not only unaware of 'the special arrangement' referred to m the 1 -ote of the Soviet embassy, but in these circumstances is wondtnng on what basis the administration of the Iranian otate Railways could be laid and what future plans could be foi th Iranian railways to be effective after the end oi hostilitic , they are at a loss to Know to wh&amp;tquarter Iran may refer for the removal of the innumerable difficulties, of which only some a given here. Should arrangements for the interference of th U.S. officials be discussed with them or will the britisn ^ Governm :nt come to some agreement with the Iranian Government on this matter? The Iranian uinistry of communications, who desire to assist the Allies in every possible way in order that they may be able to derive the utmost benefit from the use of the transport facilities of Iran are, as a result of various measures a bd. interferences of the armed forces of the U.b.A, who object to the appointment and dismissal of oven the junior official- o.. railways against their wishes, confronted with innumerable difficulties, The original circular prepared by the R.o. officials on these lines, to which the Ministry did not ^ r ^:, and a translation of the letter written in reply to it are enclosed.. Briefly, the arra^d forces of the U.S.A. desire that the. Ministry of Communications should officially acquiesce in their unlimited interference, even in the administration of Iranian railways, whereas the U.S. Government have not arrived at any agreement with the Iranian Government conc-rning the entry and interference of their forces, nor about the date of their leaving Iranian territory.Copy HEADQUARTERS MILITARY RAILWAY SERVICE PERSIAN GULP SERVICE COMMAND In the Field 20 July, 1943* Subject: Collaboration between American Forces and Iranian Officials on Personnel matters.

S. Governments* As you will be aware, the question of this agreement has often been raised for quite some time with the hope that results will be achieved as expeditiously as possible. . (Signed) Chief of Department.E nclosure No. 4 . In order to explcin the exceedingly difficult situation with which the Iranian Government have been confronted during the last two years, and to denote the weakening which has penetrated into the general condition, material as well as moral, of the country, and to show that some of the measures taken by Allied officials - obviously unintentional - have not been without effect in lowering the prestige and authority of the Government, there seems to be no alternative but to go into lengthy detail. Before entering on the subject however, mention of the two following points may be found useful. (a) If the helplessness of the Iranian Government in face of impediments and obstructions of the prevailing conditions is more or less attributed to the consequences of some of the measures taken by the Allied officials, it must not be assumed that all internal shortcomings of Iran are denied. In fact, with full realisation of the general internal deficiencies, the main purpose here is to shov/ that if the effects of certain factors (not internal) in question are determined and measures taken to obviate them, then the Iranian Government will be in a position to set about eliminating the internal deficiencies with peace of mind and with more hope of success. (b) V/ith regard to the part which some measures of Allied officials have had in the weakening of the Iranian Government, it must be stated that a good deal of the trouble seems to have arisen from the fact that in the last two years the procedure has invariably been that from time to time-one of the requests of the Allied Powers has been dealt with and it has been accomplished in circumstances where the Iranian Government could not wi th sufficient time and complete certainty consider all its consequences and seek ways and means of avoiding all possible disturbing results therefrom. Accordingly the everyday life of the people has become more and more arduous, and this in turn has increasingly damaged the authority of the administration, to such an extent that today disturbances are apparent in the structure of the whole administration, including the Army, Finance, Food Communications, Agriculture, Trade, Health, etc., and the confidence bf the people in the prospect of success of the Government m fulfilling their repeated promises is badly shaken. Hence any explanations given here naturally embody this essential point, that the Iranian Government consider as their duty the implementation of Iran’s obligations towards the Allies in the Treaty of Alliance, but they in turn expect that the Allied Powers should, as the terms of the Alliance stipulate, ! ask for the carrying out of Iran’s undertakings only in taking into consideration the prevailing conditions of the country and : the securing of the needs of her people in consultation and with the co-operation of the Iranian Government. Only thus can repetitions of the undesirable consequences which have appeared in the last two years bo avoided. It should be added that the following which^touches some of the leadjng problems of Iran, is solely an expose of the prevailing conditions for the purposes of avoiding the occurrence of similar incidents, v/ith no intention of lodging any form of complaint s ARMY Before August the Iranian regular Army was more than / 170,000 strong170,000 strong, and in addition to the annual budget of the Ministry of War, which in the year 1320 (1041-42) was ^ 93 Ail a great part of the royalties received from the An b lo-Iiapian Oil Company were also used for the purchase of arms for the Army, events of August and September 1041 disorganised the Amy .nd shook its foundations. Its numbers dwindled, so th^t it no below 90,000. Since August 1°41, however, in view oi t^ increasing rise of prices in Iran, both the expenses ° f t Hinistry of War and the salaries of officers ana men have hau to be increased. The budget of the ministry of bar in the yeai 11 (1^42-43) reached 700 million Rials, and for ^ 3 ,. 1 the sum of 1,000 million Rials has been estimated. IJ ® the responsible authorities of the hinistry o •' ^ a oroved complain that owing to the rise in the cost of living the appro^^ allocation would not meet their expenses, ana . , Q 1 ation of necessary discipline and efficient very well realised. They believe that even a billion Riaoi not be adequate for the expenses of the current year Before August l n 41 the Army was adequate and the country was tranquil? buf consequent to the events of that hate on^ hana the number of the Army has been almost halved, on in many parts of the country turbulent people and tribes have^^ got hold of arms and ammunition belonging to the ^ , t of scattered during the days of August f^.^‘^^fl^covfr their War who did not consider their budget as suific o el^ndi^TsVir ^thfs^as^d^rthrscarcity oi commoditie, whilh engulfed the great part of Iran during course of laat^^ year. Often officers as well as men of f ®f ^ rice for ing orovinces of the country were short ° f “^ly br a a erntiient their sustenance. Obviously with such conditiona the bover q could not very well expect Army to aoal e^cditiously^ which cropped up in variouo porio disturbances that qtores of arms and ammunition ^ fel q in t 0 the hands of is, a considerable quantity of the . &lt;. ti; ,g es 0 f the the British and soviet Forces curing the initi 1 t g ^ade events of August 1°41, ana as no arrangements t&amp;n0 for their return; furthermore, ^ing^o^he^^^ A substantial number of rules and machine guns and a number of aircraft were in accordance wit^^.^ wishes of the British a ut h °^h!f t e enl mde al the time by the officials.

Most of the aerodromes and Army barracks have ^P^^entiy over to the Allied Powers, anu the miniairy complaining/complaining about the lack of means of communication, because not only are they short of motorised vehicles in sufficient numbers, but as a result of scarcity they do not even possess an ade ; uate number of horses. Apart from ail this, in most of the northern provinces an Iranian Army has ceased to exist, and in the localities where there is merely a small contingent, their existence and everything in connection with them depends solely on the permission of the Soviet authorities. In this way the Iranian Army, which as a result of the events of August 1°41 had sustained a severe blow to its morale, became daily more and more weak materially and morally, and proportionate ly became discredited in the eyes of the people, to such an extent that recently in order to quell the disturbances of the lashgai tribes in Pars it was suggested to the Iranian Government that other local tribes may be armed against the cashgais; in other words the feudal system of government which with so much trouble and effort was uprooted from Iran is once again creeping to the forefront. The British Minister at Tehran in connection with the recent request of the Iranian Government to the United States Government for a certain amount of materials for the Army, wrote (letter dated 28th July, 1°45) that the materials in question could only be shipped to Iran provided that real and eiiective measures be taken for the improvement of the Iranian Army, and the lack of discipline, corruption, inefficiency and loss oi spirit which have been noticed in the last few months, removed. One of the aims of the Iranian Government in proposing a discussion of these matters is to secure the provisions, supplies and means for establishing a well-equipped.and disciplined efficient Army. Obviously without the existence oi a regufa well-equipped Army, strong and popular, the Government^ of Ira will not be capable of carrying out reforms, especially tne establishment of security and order m the country as well ao the collection of revenue. FINANCE During the last ten years the financial condition of Iran has teen so intermingled with the economic life oi the country that no measures in either of these two tranches could be taxen without affecting the other acutely. Iran's budget during the last ten^years reached seven times what it was before, and in each financial year this characteristic became and more evident, that on one hand a substantial part of the revenue of the Government was acquired ~rom tr.ue monopolies, and on the other hand a considerable part oi institutionsN^SinoeMany oflhesf insblutions Nowe^er were not of a nature to bring in immediate revenue or to moreas producing power of the country, it^was found that from time to time the Government had certain deficits in this respect^i In .p +hp -Port that the Government would not consiuer oor g ?rom abroad, th^ onf remedy to make up the deficit which was invariably adopted was to borrow from ®®^® u ‘sed an increase ^ the National Bank of MN^t^radually went up from 200 million in the note issue, so that it giauuaxxy vv thoTo in Rials 6 in the Mar’1311 (l”31-32) to 2,000 million Rials m August 1°41. This measure ^^'UfeotJrtheMosMof livinMwhic^graduaxiy rose 0 and^became * 1 substantially higher as compared with the period before//s before the last twelve years. Another Measure eonsidered necessary for the balance of trade (export and ijport), namely the otat _ Monopoly or control of trade and restrictions imposed for the aoove purpose, no doubt caused shortage of existing stocxs 01 imported goods in the country, and this added to the scarcity and furt e rise of prices. The result of the country's sacrifices ana the peoole's endurance of difficulties was, however, the creation a good many industrial institutions anu factories and the constru ion of many thousand miles of roads, and last but no , a ’ Trans-Iranian Railway. Although trade restrictions ana .aonopolieo were abolished after August 1^41 and the issue of notes for^the rjurpose of loans to the Government to balance tne huuge-t hao a s been abandoned for some time, on one hand the Allied asked for increase of note circulation to meet their expenses Iran, and on the other hand most of the above-mentioned industrial institutions as well as roads and railways !' er '® us ®d n nian Oovem- Powers without any revenue being paid over to the Iranian Go ment in respect of them. Therefore no improvement in the general situation was found, and on the contrary the cost of living rose for the various reasons stated above. If from the start a jointly considered plan had been drawn up which would have secured the aims of the Allied xow- in respect of the expenditure they haa to make, ^nd at the same time prevented disturbance in the economic li e -financial and obviously not have led to the present chaos in the financial and economic condition of the country. But the Iranian Government, unable to rind a solution for tnis difficultv not only continued even for some time alter August l ?o resort to borrowing from the Banque Uellie !ran ^irements deficit in their revenue, out in oruoi to mec h an of the Allied Powers also set about issuing n o becoiae extent that while the total amount ol no ns oo e durin g the tenfold during the last ten years since ^feust 1 41, during short period of fifteen months, the note ^^latio^ oreviously&gt; seventeen and a half times the amount no t e s fell below 20 ^. and the metal reserve against the issue oi notes leu ThiS ^fTran'irtrt^efof herleoplefand the expenditure Powers in Iran, whilst being beneficial 1 ^ tracie&gt; of providing employment ana the prospe i ( tions ordance with the exigencies oi war these trans confidence of the This series oi _ ( note issue of the Allied point of view yet, as in accOo.^.^ _ _x. were being carried out without ^; d ' llore and more to and the normal prices of gooda, jr ices up in an incredible the depreciation of notes^ sen A ‘ 0 ort i jn to seven years fashion, so that at the end ox i &lt;±a, before, prices had mounted 700;o jue, for the stocks in hand in In order to prevent the f ^ th ^ r ,^^g C ^p e °Q r editing the view of the fact that the Alii© 1 v _ , -/old against the notes Iranian Government with foreign exc iang baining to the issue they received, a few months ago the law apperta^^^ ^ pemitted of notes was amended, and there y this manner, to exclusively against foreign ^=^ 0 °ertf the itsue or notes was expedite the affairs of the Allied - Iran has been permitted, but since bhat uate the i 1 ,, loans to the unable to issue notes for the purpose °f_ 6 ^ exCu . jt ional cases, Iranian Government, as the Gover ■ ^ a their disposal does not have foreign exchange or irec goxa in/to the Banque Mellie Iran in order that they may hand it over against banknotes. At the time the Iranian Government concluding th^ financial agreements with Great Britain? th y Prices prevent the incessant issue of notes ana the ns P ^ to be provided with goods against the sterling? ^ which the British Government acquiesced m so I at^r and which was incorporated in the financial agre^ t ©ncies on? however, it was pointed out that m view of the exigences of war Great Britain could not pass on gooas ^ Iran m sufficient quantities to meet her neeas, and ther ^ E was gained in this direction. whilst ^^ th6 financial agreement with Great Britain the rate ol Bial against £ sterling was fixed, yet rise of prices reaped such an extent that it could hardly be compared that 01 any other country; even prices in Cairo, known to be extremely high, do not compare with it. The Sxpenditure of Great Britain in Iran during the last few months shows signs of decrease ,^ but in accordance ',1 m the agreement of 27 dsfand lo 21 (18m narch, 1 -^) Iranian Government is bound to leave aside substantial • for meeting the requirements of the Goviet Government, an a financial agreement somewhat similar to that with meat Britain is in process of conclusion with the U.o. wo in connection with the supply ol notes. Therefore whilst in practice the opportunity ±or^ ^ benefiting from a major part of the foreign exc ange ana gol^ which the Allied Poviers are giving to Iran in return ior ohe Rials is not available, the nett result is that the Rial expenditure of the Allies in Iran is secured through ever increasing issue of notes, which is the cause th extraordinary rise in prices and scarcity 01 goods. In - transaction notes stay in the hands of th ® ° ch while foreign exchange and gold remain outsiae Ir^n un 1 time after the war when they can gradually be exchenged with goods. This is the present state of affairs which for the time being, as a result of the issue of notes, provides work xor the people inside the country, but after the war, until suen time as things have returned to normal, for quite some time the prevailing difficulties will continue, m addition to which the people in Iran will be without employment unless beforehand plans to meet the situation are drawn up and put into effect. One of the main drawbacks of the present economic situation of Iran is the free purchase and consumption oi certain goods in Iran on the part of the Allied Powers, and what is more important, the export or these goods, such as^ products of state and private factories, and the produce ox farms, cattle, etc., particularly from the northern provinces. This practice brings on scarcity of goods, raises the prices and provides opoortunity for racketeers and smugglers to disturb the plans of the Government in this respect, with regard to imports, as the control of frontiers and especially customs houses is almost non-existent in certain parts oi tne country owing t*o the weakening and in some- cases removal ox the military forces, in particular most of the imports from the northern frontiers have appeared in the markets without payment of customs duties and charges, and in the hands of dishonest vendors are fetching fantastic prices and taking control out of the hands of the Government altogether. /AnotherAnother item of important j imncia.i. ana ^°^ in£r which has been sustained by Iran as 's/esult ox the avnndi o of the authority of the Government and the w^akenin^ ‘ £ authority of the armed forces of the councry, x- ^t until October 1942 the Government used to purchase vmea ” herid g n , neoule at the fixed rate of £10 per ton, but when Lr . oheriaan, the P American Food .dviser, arrived in Tehran, o'-inr: price of wheat being £30 in the^eighbourinyountixes, the price of wheat in Iran too was suddenly -- xv,i S measure £25i.

As to the fundamental reasons for the Budget deficit:- (a) In view of the extraordinary rise in the cost of living, eeonomv in expenditure is impracticable, and in vievy 01 the SSK-'SS2.1SSSSi entering the northern provinces do not pay any customs duties or other frontier charges. Alliance statef thlt^ 1 ?! J^These'agreements'shall also^settle Powersfin 3 '!ran'and aXu^no^gree^nL^ave been concluded with Iran so /fare*- A. so far to regulate this matter, Allied forces refuse to pay Customs duties, and many-of the internal taxes, such as uhe slaughter-house (farm produce) tax, the electricity tax, the d/e tax levied on goods entering towns and the creosote and P^tr l tax. What is still more important, a number of private persons also follow this practice, on the pretext that^whatever tne^ aie doing is in connexion with the work of the Allied forces. (d) Dr. Millispaugh has not included in the annual Budget oi Iran the revenue received from public domains, Government^ factories, trade monopolies, such tobacco ana opium, cer^a rice, piece goods and sugar, which during the last- yearo amounted to considerable sums. In his opinion, whatever revenue is derived from these sources should inevitably go to com-oensate for the loss incurred in the rice transaction, the rice being sold to Soviet Russia as fixed rates, ana tne difference in the price of selling bread below cost to the people, as well as to make up' for the deiicit yi factories run at a loss, and the expenses incurred in connection with the obligations of the Iranian Government in providing ana delivering arms to the Soviet Government. In these circumstances it is obviously diificult to convince the Iranian parliament that all this defxcit can be met by an increase in the rate of .income-tax, unless they believe in the soundness of the future financial and economic plans of the Government, and these plans will be of little value if they lack the complete and sincere support of the Allied Powers. So far no such financial help has been given to Iran, and even the financial compensation envisaged in the Treaty of Alliance, which, had to form the subject of special agreements provided in the Treaty of Alliance, Section (ii) which promises tn^t H A separate agreement or agreements shall be concluded regarding any financial obligations to be borne by the Allied Powers ” has not materialised, and no such agreements have been concluded. The financial agreemen o concluded so far have not, moreover, helped Iran in any way, o.nd Dr. Millispaugh has found no alternative cu o to ask i or a loan of 80 million dollars from the U.S.A. to alleviate the prevailing difficulties. cith regard to Lend-Lease assistance in which the U.S. Government had promised for the last eighteen months to include Iran, and the inclusion being declared over a year ago, apart from one item of 700 small lorries and some wheat nothing has reached Iran as yet. Taking into consideration the foregoing, it will be seen that even if the economic projects submitted by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to representatives of Allied Powers are not acceptable as a basis of discussions, the Iranian Government would appreciate it if the points mentioned in these projects would be discussed in any form desired, so that the tackling of financial and economic difficulties of Iran may not be postponed much longer. RAILWAYS - ROADS - PORTS Section (b) of Article 3 of the Treaty of Alliance states ' to secure to the Allied Powers, for the passage of troops or supplies from one Allied Power to the other or for other similar purposes, the unrestricted right to use,maintain,guard an, in case^of military necessity, control in any way that they may require all means of communication throughout Iran, including railways, roads, rivers, aerodromes, ports, pipelines and telephone, telegraph and wireless installations'. Section (iii)/* Section (iii) of Article 3 states 'It is clearly understood that in the application (t&gt;) (c) and (d) of the present article the Allied full consideration to the essential needs of Iran. of paragraph (ii) Powers will give m Section (ii) of Article 4 states;- ’’'A special agreement shall he concluded between tne Allied. Governments and the Iranian Government defining the conditions for any transfers to the Iranian Government after the war of buildings and other improvements effected by the Allied Powers on Iranian territory.' In order to determine the carrying out of these stipulations, the rights and obligations of Iran as well as those oi the Allied Powers, and the basis of the relations of Iran towards the Allied Powers in practical co-operation, a project was, after protracted discussions with representatives of the Allied Powers, jointly drawn up on 17 Pavardin 1321 (7th April, 1942) and handed over for forwarding to London and Moscow for approval by the respective British and Soviet representatives. But no reply was received for some time. In the meantime,however, armed forces ol the U.S.A. entered Iran, succeeding the British officials in the southern section of the Iranian Railways, the ports of Khusistan and the Chaus see roads of Khu.,istan, following which all British officials, with the exception of a few who arc still engaged in the administration of the railways in the south, left.Iran altogether. Ever since, in so far as the administration of.the Railways and ports are concerned, no authority has in practice been left with the Iranian Ministry of Communications, and it is not officially clear to the Iranian Government with whom the responsibility of the Railways rests and what the present status of the railways and their future will be. After some time, however, the British Government intimated th t they were not agreeable to the projects submitted, without any negotiations having been started to amend the proposed terms In the event of the continuation of this state of affairs, and if no basis is reached between Iran and the Allied Powers in connection with railways, roads and ports, the difficulties of both the Iranian Government and people, and the losses incurred by Iran would be unbearable, and the Iranian Government is convinced that this is neither to the liking of the British Government nor to their interest. Briefly, since the arrival of the Americans and departure of the major part of the British officials, the Committee which regularly sat in Tehran comprised of the Minister of Communication and the Chiefs of the Military Missions of Great Britain and the U.S.S.R., and which attended to all problems affecting roads and railways, thus safeguarding unity of administration and whilst observing the rights of Iran achieved the aim of the Allied Powers, disappeared altogether, headquarters of the Chief of the Military Mission of Groat Britain being transferred from Iran to Iraq. As the Government of Iran have no agreement with the Government of the United States on such matters, the Ministry of Communications cannot therefore enter into official discussions with the American Military Mission. Consequently, the Russians in the north, and the Americans in the south do whatever they like. They expect the Iranian officials to agree to all/all their donan&amp;s without any question. There is even rivalry between then in respect of the instances and the degree of interference of each party. Lest any hesitation on the part of Iranian officials in acquiescing to the wishes of Russian and Anerican officials nay be interpreted as lack of goodwill in carrying out the Allied ains, Iranian officials have so far kept silent, and as a result, discipline, cense of obedience and responsibility have disappeared from anongst officials of the Ministry of Connuni cat ions.. Owing to this state of affairs, the accounts relating to stock in hand, purchases and materials used by the railways have been disorganised and a great many stories are current about the wastage, so that it cannot be said with any amount of certainty how the assets of the railways before 1941 have been spent, what remains now, what amount of materials have been brought in by the Allies, what has become of them, and where they are located now. So long as General Rhodesvas in Iran, his goodwill and sincere collaboration was the source of appreciation to the Iranian Government, but after the Americans succeeded British officials, the whole thing seems to revolve round this point, that is the transport of more and more materials to Russia in less and less time. Generally they do not wish to enter into any kind of discussion as to the difficulties of the Iranian Government. In this connection the U.S-. Minister, under date of 31 Khordad, 1322 (22nd June, 1943) in response to the repeated representations of the Iranian Government wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs: 'In order to utilise the railways to the utmost the American Director' of Railways always collaborates with Iranian, Russian and British officials. In view of the increase of materials destined for Russia, and the civilian goods transported by the railways, no reason can be seen for any serious disturbances to have presented themselves'. It follows ^ that in the view of the Americans, so long as the tonnage to Russia is increased, there can be nothing wrong with the Iranian railways, But the Iranian Government, in expressing their satisfaction that the roads, ports and railways of Iran are of such service and benefit to the Allied cause 1 , hope that Aie Allied Powers will at the same time bear in mind the responsibilities of the Iranian Government towards the good administration protection of property, and safeguard of the interests of the railway*establishments, now and in the future, and that they should render effective aid to the Iranian Government in this respect. The British Government are fully aware that up to the end 'the year 1319 (March 1940) the Iranian Government spent 4,000 million Rials for the construction and equipment of the railways, more having been expended since the date. The amount expended on constructions, maintenance of ehaussee roads and ports amounts to a further sum about half this figure, and all this has been achieved out of the wealth of the country itself, no recourse having been made to borrowing from abroad. They are also well aware that in a country like Iran, where the wealth of the P ro P or ^i°nately so little per head as compared to that °i other countries, what hardship and sacrifices must have been sustamed by the people in order that the sum of about 6,000 million Rials be collected during the course of ten to fifteen years, ^s for the duration of the the principles normally observed in time of peace for the maintenance and upkeep of mac mery, etc., are not followed, the British Government undoubtedly will not m all fairness agree that the fruits of about -pin r n .r ar ?.° f sacr ^ 1 'i ces oi ' ^he people of Iran should be n* - a or the war uo have been used and worn out in such a way that/&amp; &lt;iat they cannot very v/cll be utilised and that the people of Iran should not receive any compensation for them* The difficulties have been further enhanced, as in the period during which the hllies have been utilising these establishments, the needs of the people of Iran, contrary to what is envisaged in the Articles of the Treaty of Alliance, have not been observed* Because firstly, the views of the Iranian Government have never been sought in order that they may be carried out and the Allied officials have always reached decisions by themselves, as. to the tonnage to be left daily for transport of Iranian goods* In the north, even empty wagons returning to Tehran are very often not allowed to take loads and are returned without carrying Iranian freight to the south, on the pretext that they may delay the loading and unloading of trains. Furthermore when the Iranian Government wishes to explain matters to them and to seek more aid in this connection, it is not known to what quarters they must refer as neither the Arnericons nor the British consider themselves as having complete control of th Railways an! sometimes consider the questions raised as coming within the jurisdiction of the Middle East Supply Centre at Cairo* So far when this centre has been approached decisions have been left in abeyance pending consideration, causing delays and complainc by Iranians, thus nullifying all the efforts of the Iranian Government. In all instaheos they have put into operation the views held by them originally. If the refusal of the wishes of the Iranian Governments was found to be necessary in view of the exigencies of war, it might be understood, but this is not so certain, as some months ago when the Americans increased the tonnage to Russia to 4 - 5*000 tons daily, and at the other end there were about &amp;0,000 tons awaiting shipment to Russia in the northern ports, the Soviet authorities were not insistent on 4 - 5,000 tons being added daily to the stocks in northern termini* At this juncture the Iranian Govern ment requested that for a few days the railway should be entirely left to transporting the stocks of material available in Khuxistan, which altogether did not exceed 20,000 tons, a few tons of which were dates (the owners of the dates trying hard to get the dates to Tehran before the coming of the hot season)• But this request was also refused, and on tiuly 8th, 1943, the U.S* Minister wrote to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs saying that he failed to understand why the Ministry was so persistent in wanting the transportation of dates* 'This was the attitude adopted, without any effort being made for the transport of other goods at Khuzista.n now that the transport of dates was not deemed advisable* ^ It is worth relating that at the time when the railways had 'adopted this attitude in connection with the transport of freight fr^om Khuzistan, the Department of Transport, which was under ohe administration of a British expert, advertised in the Press that as Khuzistan is connected with Tehran by railroad, any lorries found operating on that route would be considered as illegal and fined accordingly. This was the state of affairs as far as it concerned freight. As to passengers. During this time the only passenger wagons which operated in the whole length of the Trans-Iranian Railway, oxtenam-. 2,200 km., each week several trains operating in the various_lines, consisted of the 42 passenger cars which were in the possession of the Iranian Government before August 1941, and several of them were invariably under repair* In this connection too the railways placed whatever was over and above the requirements of the allies at the disposal of Iranian passengers, and consequently when passenger motor cars are extremely scarce in the country, many people are also deprived of tho advantage of travelling by rai • As/*****r \ As to the- railroad of Julfa, Tabriz, Sharaf-Khrneh and shipping of Lake Ourraieh, the Iranian Government have not yet been allowed to have any say in their administration for the last two years, /i protracted discussions for about ten weeks a reply has been receiv ed by the Iranian Government that there are no ulterior motives in this respect, and that Soviet trains are working on these lines. It is not denied that the Allies, particularly the British and U.S. Governments have spent a great deal of money during the last two years on the railroads and ports, and the British Government on the chaussee roads of Iran; they have brought in considerable amounts of equipment, have constructed subsidiary lines to the railroad at Ahwaz-Khoramsha.hr and Ahwaz-Hosseinieh and connected them from the Iranian frontier to the shores of Shatol-Arab and by a bridge to Basrah, have imported wagons, locomotives and other railroad materials, widened and repaired some of the roads, built one or two concrete roads and developed the ports at Khoramshahr and Bandar Shahpour, etc. But apart from the fact that the receiving of Rial notes from the Iranian Government to carry out most of this development and construction, as mentioned before, has caused so much financial and economic difficulty for Iran, there is one incomprehensible point which is that in problems which affect Iran, Iran f s views are not asked for, as in the case of the railwoad of Hosseinieh-Tanuma which was constructed without the previous agreement of Iran, and the fact that the Americans have utilised it since the 1st June, 1943&gt; without any agreement having been reached with the Iranian Government on this matter-. Moreover, in the wake of war efforts which are taking place, not only is the situation not clear as to what ultimate benefit Iran will derive, but even today the chausee roads, railroads and por' L ~ of Iran which existed before August 1941 are in a worse state of repair every day, and become dilapidated. For example the bridge on the chaussde roc.d over Qizil-Ozan river near Miyanaj in Azerbayijan has sustained a severe crack. To compensate for this damage no agreements have as yet been concluded with the Iranian Government, while the reconstruction of these establishmen\ will create so heavy burden for Iran, even to what they were befcv August 1941? that it would not be possible for the Government of Iran to effect it. Many discussions have been carried on this year, but Dr. Millispaugh did not find himself able to allow a credit for the repair of those parts of the chaussee roads the repair of which are the responsibility of the Governmento It seems necessary to state, now that all the means and capacity of the people and Government of Iran are used for trans porting materials to Russia, and that as yet no agreements are concluded for the compensation of damag.e_sustained, the Soviet Govermmsnt having taken over all the northern ports with all their belongings including cranes, dredgers, ships, etc., the officials of the Iranian railways are charged fares by Soviet officials when they travel on State business on the Tabriz-Julfa r' road, and recently when they placed at the disposal of the Iranian railways four cranes for unloading and loading their own mate ride they asked for the •&gt; hi re charge. The Iranian Government accordingly expect that as soon as possible an arrangement should be ma.de by the Allied Powers for the rectification of these matters, so that Iran may know.the basis of administration, the measure of control and the limits of responsibility of the country in connection with the railways ^ and ports for the deration of the war, and Shat is going to ha;, p at the termination of hostilities; otherwise the Iranian Govern ment is at a loss to know what to say to the people of Iran and how to satisfy their conscience.OTHER MEwiNS OF COMMUNICATION Apart from railroads, means of communication in Iran consis' of motor cars, auto buses, lorries and pack animals, and.after. tiUgust 1941 the difficulties of the people and the administration also increased in this respect, so that now travelling by hired motor car is almost impossible because they are not available nnr if one is found the hire is sure to be so exorbitant that nobody can afford or v/ill pay for it-. This scarcity of motor vehicles obtains to such an extent that even Government officials cannot be despatched to various parts of the country, and the officials whose functions depend on travelling by motor car (such as heads of district departments of roads and collectors of grain) cannot carry out their duties. In extraordinary instances, such as combatting locusts, if British military officials, on instruction, from their superiors, had not assigned the necessary motor cars and ‘lorries for this purpose, the Iranian Government would have been unable to take one step in this direction. Up to a few weeks ago a limited number of motor cars, most r them dilapidated and unsuitable for long journeys, were at the disposal of officials of the Government in Tehran and provinces. Dr. Millispaugh has given orders that they should be registered and their use restricted. No regulations have as yet been imposed on private motor cars, but apparently Dr. liillispaugh is planning to do so. Before ^vugust 1941, travel for middle-class people in Tehran from one town to another was by auto-bus. The Allies hired one hundred of these auto-busss for the use of the Poles who came to Iran. This created some difficulty for the poorer class Iranians, Half of these vehicles have however been recently released, but owing to lack of tyres there is not an adequate number of motor buses at the disposal of the people. The scarcity of tyres has created a good deal of trouble in Iran, but the main privation is the lack of lorries, which has disorganised a good deal of the administrative machinery of the a oun t ry • A* Before 1941, normally 4,000 lorries were engaged in the transport of the internal needs of Iran. Out of this number dun the events of August 1941, the Soviet officials took over about i l(|rriQs and after that most of the lorries which lacked tyres wen gra’ShaJly out of use, and proportionately fares went up, and the . prices ©£ goods increased accordingly. At this time the transpor services bf the Allied Powers, who had imported a good many tyres into Iranjpoffered to supply any lorry that worked for them with necessary tjtres, and in this way more than 2,600 lorries of Iran went over t36&amp;llled use, and the internal requirements of ^he country vi/ereampletely crippled. This ga.vo rise to complaints on the part ofahl people, and worse still, the Government were deprived of the mbans of transporting grain. After lengthy con versations with the Allied officials it was agreed to form a ’'Transport Department' to take over the transport of fche country, the Allies promising that they would supply on the basis of their own requirements a. Similar number of tyres to lorries oi 0 ^ f ^ Transport Department. The Department was formed under the.oirec of a British expert, and started work. A number of remainJ-Sg ^ , lorries did not accept the terms laid down by the Transport Dep. r ment and carried on illegitimately. Out of the 2,600 lorries r gone over to the Allies, not more than 400 were transferred to department, and a few hundred lorries which eventually came to i^- t on Lend-Lease arrived very slowly, so that the Transport Depar9 not only could not meet the needs of the Government and people but could not even carry out the needs of the Pood Ministry. Mere ^complaints were raised, by the Ministry of Pood more than anyone else. The Ministry of Commerce and Industries could not get raw materials and fuel to its factories, the Ministry of Agriculture had no means of transporting cotton, maize and the necessary materials to fight locusts, the Ministry of Posts and Telegraph could not deliver the mail from one month to another, telegrams taking ten to twenty days as most of the wires were used for the requirements of the Allies, the Ministry of War was regularly complaining that the quelling of the Qashqai tribes v/as held up on account of a mere twenty lorries, and in the meantime the people the Press and the Parliament incessantly criticised the Government on the formation of the above Transport Department. No fundamental solution has yet been found in this direction, and it is feared that the current year ! s transport problems and especially the transport of grain may be faced with the same difficulties as last year, with all its grave consequences. As can be seen, the essential transport difficulty is due to the fact that 70$ of the country’s lorries are engaged in doing the work of the Allies. The Iranian Government feel sure that if originally the Allies on entering Iran had at their disposal a sufficient number of motor cars and lorries, they would not only not have bothered about Iranian lorries, but they might have helped Iran’s tyre needs too; moreover, the Iranian Government does not overlook the fact that the United Kingdom CommeroSal Corporation have given permission to the lorries under their hire to carry Persian freight when they are not engaged in the transport of U.K.C.C. goods, and that only latterly, to economise in rubber, has this permission been with- drawn. But with all this, the Iranian Government hope, now that all the resources of Iran are being used for the purpose of the Allied Powers, that in all cases such as those mentioned here, the needs of Iran should be placed by officials of the Allied Govern ments in the same category as their own, so that whatever remedy is worked out Iran should benefit from its advantages or drav/backs, and not that the requirements of Iran should be ignored. Surely out of all the tyres that during the last two years have been sent through Iran to Russia, had an insignificant portion been delivered to Iran, all this trouble would n'ot have arisen.. The utilisation of animal packs, etc-, met with two difficult ies. One that during the years that lorries have been used in Iran gradually the number of these animals had diminished, and the number left was hardly sufficient to meet the needs of villages; moreover, on account of scarcity of food and the rise in price of fodder (hay and barley) an expansion of this method of transport v/as not feasible, apart from the fact that in the northern provinces the Soviet authorities had bought all the stocks. FOREIGN TRADE The major part of the economic needs of Iran have for a good many years been met by the import of goods from the British Empire and the U.S.S.R., and at present the essential needs.of Iran have been amply provided for, from the same sources, in the Articles of the Treaty of Alliance. Before the war Iran’s imports amounted to several hundred thousand tons; but the foreign trade of Iran before the war as /comparedcompared with coontriea where trade v/as free, had this enormous difference: that in the latter countries, goods as well as equip- •ment in abundance from abroad were imported, for example Egypt which still has a good quantity of pre-war goods lying in her warehouses and customs-houses. Whereas in Iran, on account of the various restrictions that have been imposed during the last ten years before the war, import of foreign goods v/as very limited, and so Iran had very little stock of imported goods in her ware houses as compared with that of other countries. Immediately after August 1941, when the situation in Iran changed, transactions became much freer, and Persian merchants imported a small quantity of goods from the British Empire and placed orders for a good deal more; but after a short lapse of time, owihg to the exigencies of war, Great Britain v/as donsrrained to impose certain restrictions on the amount of imports into Iran, resulting in the non-fulfill ment of a good many orders placed, and the fact that^ the Russians took away whatever food lay in the northern customs houses added to the scarcity of food, causing the merchants to complain and prices to rise. After the conclusion of the financial agreement between Iran and Great Britain, the Iranian Government were hopeful that with the possibility of importing sufficient goods into Iran, a check would be placed on the rise of prices; but soon afterwards a sub-committee of the Middle East Supply Centre v/as formed in Tehran, which made the import of goods into Iran contingent on the issue of a licence from the Supply Centre. But this Committee entailed a good deal of formality and discussions in every step it took, and moreover was compelled to observe the many.res trictions which the Central Committee had imposed at Cairo. Consequently, the orders placed by the Persian merchants previous to the formation of the Committee, v/ith a few trivial exceptions, were cancelled, together with the new applications for the import of goods into Iran* Out of the 35,000 tons allowed for the second half of 1942, 20,000 tons were cancelled by Cairo, and when the Iranian Government referred to Cairo, the reply they received was that following the orders of the British Government they coula do nothing else. With regard to the import quota of 1943, the only promise obtained by the Iranian Embassy at Cairo v/as that what Dr. Millispaugh required to carry out his economic and. financial plans, in excess of the amount v/hich had already been unproved and found inadequate by the Iranian Government, would be considered. But the goods imported by the Soviet authorities since August, 1941, have been completely managed by themselves and have reached the market without the Government having any information as to their amount, circumstances and price. The Iranian Government is aware of all the difficulties that have constrained the British Government to cut down the import of goods into Iran, but since they are confident that the British Government are not indifferent to the privations of the Iranians, they hope that in view of the unbearable difficulties of the people and the extraordinary rise in prices in Iran, the British Govern ment will take into consideration the following points:- (a) The Iranian Government have no alternative but to find a way to secure imported goods to cover the essential needs of people of Iran, particularly in the case of tea and sugar, which next to bread and rice form the basic sustenance of the people, and cotton goods which form the only clothing materials for the.bulk of the -people, and the prices of which have reached fantastic figures. Before the war the annual sugar consumption was about 100,000 tons, /20,000 tons20,000 tons of which was produced in the country, the rest being imported. The amount of piece-goods used also was about 100,000 bales, the main part being imported from Russia and the ^rest from Japan and India, a small part coming from Great Britain. Sugar was previously sold by the Government at the rate of l/- per kilo; now it is sold at 5/- per kilo, but in the free market (the markets over which the Government have.no control owing to the refusal of Soviet officials to submit to any control) the price of one kilo exceeds 18/-. Clothing materials which previously sold for l/- a metre are now sold for 4/- a metre, but in the free market it cannot be obtained even for 12/- a metre. The minimum needs of sugar and cotton goods v/hich must be imported from abroad must of necessity be arranged so that the Government may distribute them amongst the people equally and at' reasonable prices, otherwise no useful purpose will be served by placing them on ration or stabilising prices. (b) Whilst the goods essentially needed for Iran, such as cotton goods, do not reach Iran and people are in difficulties, certain home factories such as leather, thread, cotton goods and woollen goods factories are regularly engaged and produce goods for the requirements of the Allies. At the time of the cotton harvest in Iran, however, when it was known that the harvest yield was going to be less than half, and owners of cotton in Sgypt were, prepared to sell some to Iranian factories, the British authorities concerned stated that owing to the distance between Bgypt and Iran they preferred to let Iraq or Indian cotton be imported. But a sufficient quantity of cotton could not reach Iran from Iraq and the Soviet Government objected to the import of-Indian cotton into Iran on the grounds of sanitation. The r esult. of. all this was that the Iranian Government was not successful in importing a sufficient amount of cotton for Iranian factories. (c) Before August 1941 the Iranian Government and people had in transit on Soviet territory a considerable amount of goods from Germany which had been purchased and partially paid for. The fate of these goods is not as yet determined and nothing has been settled as to the losses incurred in this connexion. Moreover, at that time a substantial quantity of German goods, fully or partially paid for by the Iranian Government and private individ uals were lying in the Iranian customs-houses. Soviet officials however took over a part of these goods which they said they needed, and to deliver the rest to their real owners, asked for further payment of the full price of the goods, which the owners had to pay for a second time. This necessarily doubled the price of the goods before they had entered the market and contributed greatly to the rise in prices of other goods. Soviet authorities based their action on the assumption that as the goods in question were consigned to German nationals, who were in fact only trade agents in Iran, they were regarded as belonging to German nationals, .md the Soviet Government were accordingly empov/ered to confiscate them and sell them to Iranian merchants as their own goods. (d) It has been noticed that in all problems relating to Iran, even though of a very important nature, Allied officials invariably do not seek the views of the Iranian Government, and do not consider this as necessary, and for this reason the decisions taken directly by them and communicated to the Iranian Government or various departments create much difficulty for the Iranian Government* Whereas the Iranian Government believe that this method is incompatible with the aims and desires of the British Government, as the responsibility for the administration of Iran is an obligation of the Iranian Government. In this way, however it/I it is not knov/Ti how the Governnent is supposed to exercise their responsibility. Were these decisions to be tnken with the agreement of both parties and in harmony with the interests of both parties, with a sense of sincere collaboration existing, there is no doubt that a suitable solution would be found for all the problems in question. On the other hand, problems affecting Iren obfore reaching London have to pass through various stages in Iraq or Cairo, this wasting a good deal of time, confusing^the issue and depriving the Iranian Government of the opportunity of explaining their case. The Iranian Government therefore believe that if instead of passing through these various stages in every minor or major problem, the principles of main questions could once and for all be discussed and solved with the British Governnent in London, most of the difficulties on both sides would be eased. Iran has not as yet benefited from Lend-Lease - that is about ten months ago two representatives arrived in Iran from the U.S.A. and stayed for some time at Tehran. They took a list of all the requirements in Iran, but no results have been seen apart from a few hundred lorries and a quantity of grain. AGRICULTURE Since August 1941 three factors have^gradually affected the agricultural life of Iran adversely, and if a speedy cure is not devised it is quite possible that they will cause much loss in the agricultural products of the country. These factors are as follows:- (a) The insecurity of the country owing to the disintegration of the Army and security forces subsequent to the events of August 1941. This has in many districts driven the life and property of the Iranians to the mercy of the turbulent tribes and local •bandits, so that the peasants in Orunieh and Ardalan (Western provinces of Iran inhabited by Kurds) are not ov/ners of their own life and property on account of Kurds, and in Pars on account of Qashqais, and in Kerman on account of Buchakhchi, and as this insecurity spreads more and more every day, the area under cultivation inevitably suffers in proportion. (b) Lack of essentials of life or their exorbitant prices. ^his has gradually driven away the peasant from his farm and caused his migration to towns where the necessities of life are comparatively more available. So that at the beginning of this year peasants from many thousands of areas went over to the railroads and roads administration of Khuzistan, and took up work under the Americans, as the Americans in addition to their daily wages gave them regularly half a kilo of flour, 55 gra» sugar and 8 gm. tea* For similar reasons during the last two years a minimum of 100,000 persons has been added to the population of Tehran. (c) The unprecedented dispersal of agricultural requirements in the way of cattle, horses and mules, etc., was due to the that the peasants, owing to the enormous rise in prices and the urgent need for cash, sold most of them, and buyers of these animals either took them out of Iran or sent them.to the slaughter houses. In this respect the importation of chemical manure and agricultural machines would certainly be one of the useful measures. To achieve this and to provide sustenance for the farmers and the development of agricultural needs, such as seeds, oxen and water, adequate capital would be required, and as m Iran 39,000 villages are registered, no improvement intne agricultural life of Iran, except by means of a sufficient amoun of capital, could be possible. If this year’s harvest of wheat has been satisfactory, it is on*account of the fact that farmers and landowners, with an eye /toto the high prices fixed by the Government last year for grain, were encouraged, and also as a result of the irrigated crops abundent water has had good effect. On the other hand, the recent harvest of cotton dropped from 20,000 tons to 8,000 tons, and the recent harvest of beetroot which last year was about 150,000 tons and produced 20,000 tons of sugar, suddenly dropped to two thirds. One of the leading difficulties of the Ministry of Agriculture is that a few brokers from the Levant (such as Issayov and Lapidos) in the guise of officials and contractors of the armed forces of the Allies are devastating the forests of Iran, and the request of the Ministry of Agriculture is that in conjunction with the representatives of the Allied Governments some speedy arrangements may be made so that no more trees could be cut down except in the measure advised by scientific experts and not in a way harmful to the existence of forests. 'If British firms could come to some arrangement with the Iranian Government on this issue, it would naturally be to the interest of both parties. One of the pestilences which during the last two years has threatened Iran is locusts, which during the last year completely wiped off the harvest of certain southern pa^rts. This year, although it has not caused much damage, experts of the Allied Governments have drawn up extensive plans for combatting it next year - plans that will cost about 400,000,000 Rials (at the official rate of 130 Rials to the £, over £3 million) and in their opinion if these plans are not acted upon all next year’s harvest will be in danger. The Iranian Government has during the last year and the current year spent about 100,000,000 Rials (over £700,000) to combat locusts and is very appreciative of the valuable assistance given by the Allies in this connection. But the point at issue is that on one hand the Iranian Government, faced with financial stringency, cannot set aside 400,000,000 Rials for this purpose and on the other hand the Soviet Government maintain that unless plans for combatting locusts are carried out in Iran, Soviet harvests will be endangered too, whereas this pestilence of locusts does not originate from Iran, but is a nuisance which comes from territories of the British Empire and ruins the crops in Iran. At the same time representatives of Great Britain state that purely from a technical point of view combatting the locusts before they reach Iran is not possible, and in the circumstances it seems hardly fair that Iran, situated in the middle, should bear the brunt of all this expenditure. In the conference convened a few weeks ago at Tehran for this purpose, at which the representatives of Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. and other Eastern countries participated, it was suggested that purely from the point of view of combatting locusts Iran should be divided into three zones. The Iranian Government, however, could not accept this suggestion and consequently the methods for the execution of the vast plans drawn up by the experts was not made quite clear. Of course whilst there is still an opportunity the Iranian Government has to find a way out with the help of the Allies. In addition to all this, the Ministry of Agriculture has compiled a list of its requirements, and for some time past has requested competent British authorities at Cairo to make necessary provisions for them, but so far no replies have been received by them.INDUSTRY AND MINES Mining and industry (the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in virtue of its special circumstances is not included in this analysis) which were established during the last fifteen years in Iran and which were gradually developed, are worthy of careful consideration owing to the orders placed with Germany for their equipment, the price having been paid in full or partially, and the fact that after the events of August 1941 it was not clear what was going to happen to thorn and how their needs in spares, etc., would be met; because a good deal of the machinery which the Government and people had bought from Germany prior to 1941 and paid for, some remained in Germany and some in Russia, and all the efforts of the Iranian Government to get them to Iran were of no avail. The Government of Iran paid one item of 30,000,000 marks to Germany for an iron-smelting factoryand equipment, but apart from a small consignment of iron goods, fireproof bricks and electrical equipment, no more has reached Iran, and until now no agreement has been reached with the Allied Powers for some sort of arrangement to compensate these and other losses of the Government and people of Iran. Moreover, the industrial needs of Iran (Governmental and private) have repeatedly been supplied to British representatives and Lend-Lease representatives, but no results have come to hand as yet, and as all goods of this nature which were available in the Iranian market have gradually been consumed, and the machinery is in a state of deterioration, a major part of the factories will perforce close down shortly. With all the prevalent difficulties the State and private factories and mines are nevertheless regularly engaged in executing orders of the forces of the Allied Powers, and in the circumstances it is not quite clear to the Iranian Government how the principles of collaboration work in this instance when the forces of the Allied Powers are unable to include the needs of these factories and mines amongst their military requirements. Some of the officials of the British Government in Tehran have spared no efforts in this direction and to provide the needs of these establishments have pursued the matter as if it was their direct concern, but the results obtained have been negligible, and even then mostly out of the materials available in Iran itself, no imports being possible from outside Iran. The very fact that owners of these private factories are partly executing orders for the Allied Governments, directly placed with them, prevents the Iranian Government from compelling them to observe the relevant regulations in force in the country. The significance of these factories and mines in Iran today, as detailed above, is far greater than the importance generally attached to industry and mining, because considered from the social aspect it is possible that if not managed tactfully and with wisdom, in the near future they may become the centre of certain extremist movements, with.some undesirable consequences. It is obvious that today without the effective support of the Allied Powers, the Iranian Government is unable to obtain satisfactory results from her measures in this connection. PUBLIC HEALTH The expedients normally adopted by other countries in general for the safeguard of public health and protection from general diseases cannot, owing to financial stringency be developed ona large scale in Iran, and in this way when owing to privations and scarcity of commodities the populace is gripped 'by genera debility and various diseases, the diseases peculiar .0 wartime come on the top of all the others, creating altogether a f° r ^oding state of affairs for the people. Amongst tht-se diseases is yp , which did not exist, except in exceptional cases m Iran previou y in this form, and in reality was brought last year by Polish refugees into Iran and spread all over the country, so that 1 Tehran alone the number of deaths caused by it reached a tnou^a per month. Eventually, with the expedients adopted to combat it the situation has improved, but it is feared that 1 nay rather severely during the coming winter. to combat typhus On the whole the Iranian Ministry of Health, and other contagious diseases and to take other necessary nicdica measures has certain requirements which the middle ¥ Centre have approved, granting the necessary licences ^or their import into Irpn, but no news has reached Iran as to their arrival, and the Ministry of Health request for their speedy importation. Amongst the above-mentioned needs, those that sre of considerable importance are the various kinds of medicine whic are needed all over the v^orld as much as bread. In Iran during the last t^ r o years the question of scarcity and expensiveness 0 medicine has reached such heights that not only people \ no means cannot buy them and therefore die from various diseases, but even wealthy people are crippled by the prices they have to pay. Por instance the price of one in action mhich was previously has now reached 25/- and the price of a bottle of certain tablets which was previously 5/- has now reached 30/-. Other ordinary medicine has also proportionately risen in price, in some cases exceeding the above rises even; for example one tablet of qumm which was formerly about Id is now sold for l/- or more, and on account of scarcity it is not genuine quinine ither. Thus, if immediate consideration is not given to the despatch of adequate amount of medicine to Iran, more people will sacrificed. The Iranian Government fed sure that the British and American Governments vail assist them in bringing about a relief of this situation. Another health requirement of the people is soap, the price of which during the last two years has risen from od a cake to 5/-, and the ordinary person is not able to buy and use it. Iran soap is frequently manufactured from local ingredients an there is a soap factory in Tehran, but there is great difficulty owing to scarcity and expensiveness of oil and fats. ±he Iranian Government is fully aware of the needs of ooviet nussia for fats and vegetable oils, and the Ministry of Industries has come to an agreement with the Soviet authorities to utilise jointly cotton seed oil and has agreed to deliver the glycerine manufactured to the Soviet Government. Only recently Soviet officials , for the delivery of a fevr hundred tons of soap from the V of Industries, but with the present conditions the oil and lat procurable in the market is not sufficient ^r all requirements, and their price is high. To alleviate the difficulties, some time ago the Iranian Government tried to arrange 1 or the impor 0 coconut oil from India, but nothing came of this. io maintain the health of the people, however, ways and means will have xo devised.POOD AND LOO INITIAL COiviMODX'riDS During the last tv;o years, Ir ™ ’ ® ood f f o^her people^ of many other countries, has teen situation as regards sugar, Out of the essential conmodities, th . pfo the remainder tea and cotton goods has been de ^ f f el in i ran being wheat, rice, meat and fuel (.the 'ain iiems apart from fuel oil, consists of wood and charcoal) regards trafsjort Governments 1 ^^ 0 in need of -od In Practice of means of transport has not imrpoved in the price of each ton of charcoal that of each ton of vrood respect Difficulties as year mainly arose on the fact that Allied the question of lack any way , so that now is’ £20 in the market If the measures contemplated oy ur. cannot be carried out, the price of rise still higher. m in summer Tehran, and iviillispaugh in this v/ood and charcoal are sure to In order to limit as far as essential needs of the people of of woollen goods, shoes, is made chicken, of which have risen ago, and the people are should be reiterated, that concerned, the main reason possible the number of the Iran discussed here, no mer.tio hats; of foodstuffs such as eggs, butter, various kinds of ^uits^ etc., the pric^ §■ sr ,v “ • rsicL g r.\»« r = r « s . in the amounts of goods imported. y£ld a good harvest in (with the exception of wheat which did not yeld^a^goo 1942) it must be said that the ^ ra s°n example last has not been so much scarci y °-v c ^ f » ar better than any year produced a ” ears , ’ and the various kinds of produced during the last thir y y of the ]_ aS t ten years, fruits were more abundant lPn ^ iful an d scarcity in meat whilst chicken and eggs were also P^^nted rise in prices v;as not so acute. hence vhe t n P find the following four is studied carefully, one is bound to find the ioiio b contributory causes:- (!)

Explanations that can be given about the four contributory causes mentioned a^ove are as follows.- -ith regard to the ^purchase of goods in Iran foP^nce forces, and their associates, in spi .e o_ . , ^ Allied August 1941 repeated assurances have been given by t^ ^ ^ Governments that their forces vil .in : 1 other requirements far as the provision of food, habitation and ^h^^ ^ are concerned, and this was in a broa ^ ^ observed. Treaty of Alliance, not only is this no s ^ pyp^ages made in'thfmarklt^rfgivinrrise to^eneral complaints There are some indispensable Allied ^^I^^Vpeople^riran^s seen imported, but the opinion held by the Pe°P^ ° Iran's that as the number of Allied forces ^proportion to ir.n population i s not enormous, shou closet*/closer collaboration prevail amongst the parties concerned, the competent authorities of the three Governments could at the same time take into consideration the unimportable essential needs of the Allied forces that it is within Iran’s capabilities to supply and also those of the people of Iran, and on a fair basis come to some general arrangement for the welfare of all concerned, so that no cause may remain for individual measures or separate pur -hases. Of course restrictions in shipping are well understood, and it is certainly a source of satisfaction that the Allies of Iran tried to bring some help when the food situation became extremely grave. Great Britain from March 1943 began gradually to despatch to Iran the 25,000 tons of wheat they had promised, and the Soviet Government following this sent another 25,000 tons of wheat to Tehran. But during the anxious days of four or five months before March 1943, the expectation of the Iranian Government was that in view of the many existing bonds between the two countries, and in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Alliance, and owing to the significance attached by Great Britain to the security of Iran and the r ,d to the U.S.S.R., the British authorities would consider the question of the alleviation of the privations of Iranian people in the wake of other war problems which occupied their time and efforts; particularly as the scarcity of food and hunger in Iran were due in a certain measure to the disappearance of security, which it was hardly possible to re-establish, without the aid of the Allies. The Iranian people saw with their own eyes the care and attention British authorities gave to thu welfare, food, clothing' habitation, cleaning, medical treatment, sports, physical and spiritual culture of over SOyQOO Polish refugees who had arrived in Iran; whilst a considerable number of people in Tehran could not find their daily bread, whilse disease and death were prevalent and the cost of living had gone up to such an extent that an e g at a shilling could not be found and the press reported periodically that abundant supplies of white bread, milk, meat, butter, eggs, chicken, jam, etc,, wore supplied for Polish refugees, a fact that was confirmed by the American Pood adviser. The Iranian people were wondering ' it was that the British authorities took no steps to relieve or remedy the misfortunes of the Iranian people to the same extent as those of the Poles. It is purely on account of the great interest which Iranians have in maintaining and developing friendship with Great Britain that this expose has been attempted at such length; moreover, it is intended to show that the Government of Iran consider it their duty to carry out, with the help of the British Government, all steps necessary for the removal of any misgivings that may lurk in the minds of Iranians. With regard to the export of wheat, rice, pulses, potatoes, butter, other foodstuffs, and cattle, etc. from Iran, in so far as the exports without Government authority are concerned (substantial amounts of these have undoubtedly left the country during the course of last year) the only remedy seems to be for the Iranian Government to draw up some definite and practical plan with the help of the Allied Governments, and to put it into operation with their full support, otherwise so long as the Iranian Government cannot control the r dn, particularly the frontiers and the customs of the country, they can certainly not be in a position to fulfil their duties and prevent goods being smuggled out of Iran. These remarks, however, do not apply to goods exported with the consent of the Iranian Government during the last year, when it was agreed to sell to the Soviet Government 20,000 tons of wheat and barley, 30,000 tons of rice, 2,000 tons of potatoes, delivery being below cost, and also the export ofa substantial number of cattle, pack animals and other gocas. In virtue of the economic and political bonds and oho good-neighbourly relations between Iran and the U.S.S.R. for a good many years, an. particularly in view of the new-*.chapter whicn since one irec. y^ of Alliance ho.s be^n opened in Ira.no-Russian collaboration, the expression of cordiality and friendship which the Iranian Government voluntarily make in these difficult days to contribute to Russian supplies, is not intended to make the Soviet Government feel under any obligation to Iran, particularly «o the Soviet Government have in former years regularly purchased from Iran grain and rice, etc. which were transported to Russia. ±hc loss sustained by the Iranian Treasury in the sale of ^the.above- mentioned grain, rice, potatoes, etc., in view oi fri^nas.iip towards the Soviet Government is not intended for tabulation. The Iranian Government, however, expect that officials oi the Soviet Government should not overlook the fact tnac^it is _ essential for Iran to transport regularly all possible gro.m, rice and other foodstuffs from the northern provinces of Ii.u,n to feed her other provinces, and for this purpose the Soviet officials should help the Iranian Government with all the existing means of transport, such as railroads, trucks, pack animals, etc., and with all other facilities at their disposal,^ particularly as in the years before 1941 this practice was a1n.ys followed, and the various provinces of Iran invariably met their ii' eds from amongst themselves, as is done in other countries. Moreover, whilst the British and American Governments send all the foodstuffs they can, such as flour sugar, pulses, tinned food, v tc., via Iran to Russia, and the hungry people of^Iran see with their own eyes the many warehouses in Iran packed with these goods, and proportionate even unen tho measure hen do not expect a share in these goods of their partnership in furthering the war effort, is it too much to expect and it can.bo interpreted in any other way but as a fair and inexorable right of the people of Iran to ask for the transport of part of the surplus of their ovai products of the northern provinces to other parts of their country? The Iranian Government, however, have not been ^ ^ successful in reaching a general agreement on uhis matter, thougn it must be added that a small amount of grain and rice have trickled through to Tehran from tlm- northern provinces. The _ ^ Iranian Government, in order to prove that they were prepared uo go further than they had alrea.dy done for the furtherance of uhe v/.r effort of the Allied Powers, also signed an_ agreement with the Soviet Government to manufacture for them rifles, revolvers and bullets. All th; past experience should three parties of the Treaty of ,-kLli some arrangement for the collection and distribution, carrying out this so that it could reasonably be made causes that contributed to last yea ugly heads again this year. Othcrw this year fortunately there has bee prospect of a good rice crop, and a the harvests of Iraq, Palestine, Sy particularly good, it is feared tha Government and people and the Allic similar difficulties to those of la question in Iran is still, owing to is expensive (in Tehran a few month the price of eread being fixed at 3 which the Iranian Treasury has not losses regularly sustained in this up to hefore the aforesaid rise in £47,000 per month. V/hat is certain in the current year guide the anco to come without delay to of the harvest, its storage plan with each other’s help certain that none of the four r’s misfortunes could rear their ise, in spite of the fact that n a good wheat harvest and the ccording to information in hand ria and Egypt have also been t once again the Iranian d Powers will b^ faced with st year. Moreover, the bread other reasons, unsolved, for it s ago 30&gt; was added to its price, Rials per kilo) in spite of as yet been saved from the respect, this loss continuing price of bread at the rate of . is that neither the people can// can 'bear the 'burden of the high price nor can the Treasury stand the loss any longer. Apart fron the fact that the Government’s duty is to secure ^ythe essential needs of all the people, today in Iran the condition of Civil Servants in particular occupies first place in the anxiety of the Government, because probably all other classes of the population can either increase their wages or the cost of their goods when prices rise, but this is net possible for Civil Servants whose fixed salaries are a maximum of twice what they were twenty years ago, whilst the cost of living is ten times what it was in those days. Whatever reform measures are contemplated by the Government, they must be carried out by Civil Servants, and if these officials feel anxious for their own sustenance, it is sure to reflect on the services they render.. When it is observed that the salaries of Civil Servants, in whatever rank they may be, covers only a small portion of their expenses, and that the monthly salary of those with the highest rank in the Service is barely sufficient to pay for two suits or five pairs of shoes or two tons of charcoal, it is obvious they are being put' to a very harsh test. Civil Servants have waited patiently and hopefully during the last two years, but if even now no remedy is found, they will be still more dissatisfied, and civil discipline may suffer. Signs of this disaitisfaction became apparent a few months ago when some engineers of State factories refused to work for some time. It was at that tino that the Government promised to do something for all Civil Servants in general. Some time ago a project was drafted to enable the Government to supply the essential needs of Civil Servants and distributed them amongst them at reasonable prices, compatible with their salaries, but hr. Millispaugh could not find funds for separate establishments for this purpose, and owing to depletion of Government revenue has not been able to provide for any increase in Civil Servants’ salaries in the estimates of the Budget recently submitted to the Parliament. So that in Iran today not only are the people faced with many d'lfficulties in their everyday life, but the Civil servants, who form the executive forces of the administration, are finding life very bitter. The sum total of all those problems is that Press and Parliament constantly criticise the situation and attack the Government. Naturally their utterances and writings add to the troubles and present the Government as weak in the eyes of the people, against these the only step the Government can take is the banning of newspaper, but if following this banning the Government is not in a position to relieve the misfortunes of the people and country, as has been the case up to the present, the banning only makes a newspaper more popular, other journals emulating it, and the continuation of this state of affairs is gradually tending to weaken the country to such an extent that it is bringing the machinery of the administration to a standstill. Tho Iranian Government have no doubt that Great Britain who has the tranquility of Iran at heart, is desirous that the Iranian Government should, with full Allied support, proceed to remedy all the aforesaid ailments of Iran, thereby relieving the. mind of the people of Iran and her Allies.Papers may be removed from or placed within this File only by the Political Registry.

The memorandum chiefly concerns the material demands being made upon Iran during the occupation, and requests that the Iranian Government be given more input into arrangements made between its British and Soviet counterparts, with, or in regard to the establishment of a ‘Persian Corridor’ for the transport of war materials from Iran’s ports on the Gulf to the Soviet Union.
