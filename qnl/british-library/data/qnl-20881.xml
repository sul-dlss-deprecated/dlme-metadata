Sir, I have the honour to refer to your lotter No. 458 dated 10th July 1909. I think Sheikh Esa could most suitably reply to the Mutas- sarif as follows; That he (Sheikh Ssa) finds the Mutassarif t s communication too ambiguous to take any specific or satisfactory action upon; but should the Mutassarif wish to communicate more fully he re quests that he will address himself to the British Political Agent Pldas© advise Sheikh Esa accordingly and let me know the re sult in due course. The alternative would be for you to inform the Mutassarif that Sheikh Ssa has placed his letter of 10th Jemadi II in your hands and request that the Mutassarif will, if he sees fit, address you more explicitly in order that you may be in a better however position to advise Sheikh Esa. The latter^will presumably prefer the first alternative,, and it seems the more courteous , I havs the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant.

His attitude throughout was that his dignity aa a Ruler would be destroyed by his conaenting to our dealing with a matter of this sort for him. finally seeing that his mind was closed on the sub;)e3t, I coiaiaunicated your third choice to him, which he accepted. , - v I am given to understand that the people^whom it is desired to extradite, have not betsii found in Bahrein.

Dated Bahrein, the 5th July 1915 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 2nd in- etant Sheikh lea sent his Secretary Sagar Zayyani to no with a letter which had been received from the Wali of Buareh* The letter wae dated 27th Jamadi II, 1551 («20th May 1915) but it appeared from the postmarke that it had been missent to Bombay. In it the Wali asked Sheikh lea to arreet and return to Buereh an absconding government servant named Saleh Sffendi, who was said to be in Bahrein. Sheikh Isa had enquiries made and it was ascertained that the individual in question had been in Bahrein sometime but had made himself scarce about a fortnight ago. The Sheikh seemed anxious to reply to the letter, and there seemed no reason that an answer to the above effect should not be sent. Sheikh Isa accordingly wr^te a letter informing the Wali that the absconder had been in Bahrein but had left a short time ago. This letter was shown to me today by Sagar and will no doubt go by this mail. As soon as the new Anglo-Turkish Agreement is signed I trust that the Turkish Oovemment will take steps to prevent the local Turkish Authorities from communicating with Sheikh Isa direct. Most of thetletters are about absconders, and as ' tinder the forthcoming Bahrein Order-in-Oouncll the Resident will, I understand, take the place of the Governor of a Colony forfor purposes of the Fugitive Offenders and Extradition Aota as far as Bahrein Is oonoemed, presumably the Xooal Turkish officials should address themselves to you In such matters# unless It Is more correct for them to arrange matters through Consul at Busreh* I have the honour to be # Sir, Your most obedient servant# Wajor# Political Agent# Bahrein#'xh No, Zf/O of 1913. v-k i uj^hl 1 CM ) British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, /$ July 1913. 4/ IcV.

The inoonvenienoe that has been experienced by us in the past from the Shaiiih of Bahrain being led into corresponding with the Basrah authorities direct, is a matter with which the Government of India are acquainted, ^ould it not be logical now,,in view of the Convention to ask the Ottoman Government, to convey instructions to their' Basrah authorities to the effect that the latter ^should either address the ShaiKh through the medium of the British Agent or address the British Agent himself. It would be convenient, with an ignorant ShaiKh like the present one, to preclude direct correspondence with him entirely if this could be brought about. Oox.CONFIDENTIAL.

I however, took advantage of a chance remark of Shaikh Isa s in the course of our interview to the effect that he had nothing to do with the Turkish or any Foreign Government to reply that I was glad to hear that h had realised this, as, in the recent case of a Jew deserter, I had^ received le instructions of my Government to remind the Shaikh ot his obligations no to correspond direct with Foreign Governments or their authorities. Shaik 'Isa endeavoured to draw a distinction between correspondence regarding matters of administration and other correspondence, to which I replied that the case in question was undoubtedly an administrative matter, that the line was very difficult to draw and that all such correspondence was dangerous and better avoided.1 Photocopying process Name fi L' K ^ REFER TO THE SPECIALIST CONCERNED INDIA OFFICE LIBRARY and RECORDS Photocopying record Ref. no .

Some items of original correspondence between the Turkish authorities and Sheikh Isa is included in the file. There are in total seven individual cases of correspondence received:In July 1909, the Mutasarrif [administrative authority] of Nejd wrote to complain of prohibited articles (presumed by British officials to be arms and alcohol) being secretly exported from Bahrain into Nejd via a place called Hisn (folios 2-10)In January 1910 the Wali of Basra wrote to Shaikh ‘Īsá regarding the estate of a Turkish man named Abdul Hamid al Attar Baghdadi, who died in Bahrain, and is alleged to have left debts, records of which could not be found by British officials (folios 11-18)In June 1911 the Wali of Basra wrote to Shaikh ‘Īsá to complain of the delay to post sent from Basra to Hasa, in Bahrain quarantine (folios 19-31)In November 1911 the Wali of Basra wrote to Shaikh ‘Īsá requesting that a man who was alleged to have robbed and murdered in the bazaar in Basra, and who had subsequently fled to Bahrain, be returned to Basra. Enquiries were made by the Political Agent with the American Mission in Bahrain, where it was rumoured (but subsequently found to be not true) that the man was staying (folios 32-47)In April 1912 the Wali of Basra wrote to Shaikh ‘Īsá demanding the return of eight Turkish soldiers who had deserted and allegedly fled to Bahrain (folios 48-74)In April 1914 the Wali of Basra wrote to Shaikh ‘Īsá requesting that he apprehend a Jewish man said to be a deserter from the Turkish Redif [reserves] (folio77)In May 1914 the Wali of Basra wrote to Shaikh ‘Īsá regarding a claim made by two women on a share of some date gardens in Bahrain (folio 83).In each case most of the correspondence between the Bahrain Political Agent and the Political Resident relates to the nature of the discussions between the Turkish authorities and Shaikh ‘Īsá, and how they should deal with it. According to the existing treaty between the British Government and the Shaikh of Bahrain, if the correspondence was deemed to be political (for example, in extradition cases), then the matter should by default be referred to the Political Agent. In a telegram sent to the Government of India, dated 13 July 1913, the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Cox) wrote that he and his colleagues regarded Turkish officials’ direct contact with Shaikh ‘Īsá as being an inconvenience, and would rather the Shaikh not reply directly himself, but instead refer all matters to the Political Agent (folio 71).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
