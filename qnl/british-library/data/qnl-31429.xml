Would it be possible to run a main drain down the ditch outside the town walls into the harbour? Would it be better afld cheap er to have collecting tanks for the liquid waste and carts to take it to a place where it could be dumped in the sea and an incinerator for the dry refuse. This would have to be coupled with the introduction of public latrines. I wish for your views on a possible scheme and the probable cost.

Please see my report on the scheme.In Tuyan we have 7 wells,all belonging to local men. 4 wells have drinking water and their reservoir,® d the re*t have slight hrakish water,this is used for washing pmrposees and one of the well has a reservoir,and a pipe connection to H.H.Sultans house. The average diameter of the well is about 8 feet,and depth of water 6.5’. I fear the total yield of all4 wells in a day will not be more than 30000 gallons.lt is better we make certain observation here at this point and exactly know now much water can be had for our use. A man is to be deputed to stay at each well through out the period the water is drmwn out day and note the fall in well at the tnterwell of one hour.This will give us an idea of how much water can be had. If we once know the overage quantity of water available in summer and winter g months, we will think of desining the capacity of the tanks. 2 Once the capacity of the tank is decided,we have to find its site.It is necessary to have the tank on an elevated place.The site in ray openion is one near the old Renan latholio Chrch in Tuyan. this water will by gravitation will flew i» tli. pipe,and this will he cheaper medhod.than having a tank in a plane like ground near big mo.que, 3 On the assumption that the wells all put together will yield daxi. *bout 60000 gallons of water,of this nearly half will go for wasshing purposes. This quantity of water we hav to drain daily.At present all the washing is done by water drawn from the wells at thir doors,and each house has a oess pool. Those that live on elevated place have no wei is buey get wqter from the plains. . h andie the question of wa ter 08 4 It is cue ternary o dose t one and the same time.

Zuhadiya water is considered to he the best one. All most all the Hindus get their drinkingwater from Zubadiya,and those tthat afford to pay also get their water from there. The one peeularity of Zubadiya 2 wells is that one does not find the trace of moss on th. sides of the well It is for the doctor to tell what the cause of it. 6 In conclusion I beg to state that the scheme appears to be very big one,and the means awailable are limited, therefore,! suggest taking one portion of Masket.and experiment the water system and sanitary system.Ali Khans pipe runs up t» the mosque,a 1' pipe oonneetion to the locality called Takiya,which is the thickest populated place will be useful as model for out work.Water,drainage,and sanitary things all to be taken in hand,if funds permit.

Para 2 (b) ■ Burying of night-soil is never satisfactory and I think a better method should be commenced from the outset. Muscat has the great facility of the open sea for the disposal of excreta and I suggest that advantage should be taken of this method of disposal of night- soil. It would require a small dhow and crew, sweepers to accom pany the dhow to sea. The buckets from the latrines could be carried in suitable compartments and dumped when 2 to 3 miles out at sea. This could be done twice daily. While at sea the buckets could be cleansed and brought back to land. According to the state of the sea at the time the dhow could either use the main harbour or the sea on the S.E/side of Muscat. (c) I surest suitable URINALS be built adjoining the LATRINES. This will prevent the constant use of the latrines ^nd do away with an excess of -liquid excreid. LATRINES to be made with a spare bucket for each seat. While one is being disposed of at sea the other could be in use. (d) MARKET.... Suggest a second market be built opposite the oresent one, for the sale of meat. No cleaning of fish or carcases should be permitted outside the market proper. At present the area around the market is foul. (e) Mosques.... All mosques should have enclosed cisterns with taps as in India. A man-hole on top will facilatate filling and cleaning*Muscat (3) if PEnSajf^L. July 18th, 1939. I am interested in the future welfare of the people of Muscat and I have,in my spare time, been considering the problem of the health of the population. I have been struck with the comparative ease with which it will be possible to eliminate the mosquito and bring the blessings of good health combined with an adequate and convenient water supply, and proper sanitation to the i inhabitants. I have drawn up a simple and inexpensive scheme and suggested a method of meeting the cost in volved. That the cost will be met I have no doubt. In fact my rough calculations lead me to the conclusion that the income will be two or three hundred rupees more than help pay for the introduction of the piped system of water supply. I suggest the problem of Matrah be / considered His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman.- 2 considered at an early date* I am sending these notes to you in a private capacity and my suggestions of those of an interested spectator living in Ifuscat* k. 7 OFF OP^I have been examining the possibility of eliminating the mosquito^ from the town of Muscat and introducing a simple system of sanitation. The elimination of the mosquito will mean the prevention of Malarial Fever and the introduction of a sanitary system will go far to preventing such deseases as Enteric Fever etc.} in fact all diseases that are traceable to dirt. I have examined the two projects together as they are interdependent. The eliminating of the mosquito can only be brought about by destroying the breeding larvae and removing the breeding centres. These centres are standing water and waste water from houses and mosques. The removal of waste water from houses and other buildings is a sanitary undertaking. 2. That it is desirable to prevent the occurrence of malaria and such disease is beyond dispute. That it can be done is a matter of opinion. I am of the opinion that it can be done and what is more done without a great expenditure on such a project is always justified. I have had experience of other parts of Arabia which were notorious for the damage done to the health of the population by malaria. One place in particular has been completely cleared of all mosquitoes. This place is Aden. There the conditions of living and the physical conditions are the same as in Muscat. At the present time there are no mosquitoes in the Colony and there is no admittance to the local hospitals of patients suffering cn from malaria contracted within the Colony. The scheme that I have in mind is some what similar to that which has been introduced with success there with certain modification to suit the not quite so advanced standard of living in Muscat. 3. General . The problem may be divided into two main divisions. They are firstly, the filling in or closing of sources of water / supply2 JQ . supply which are not essential and the proofing with gauze wire or other means those that must be left open for drinking, washing and agricultural purposes and secondly, the removal of wet and dry refuse from the town limits and its destruction. 4. Present system . (a) Drinking. The population obtain their drinking water from open well s at Tuyan. The water is drawn from wells that belong to the Sultan or are privately owned or are owned by a mosque. The water is drawn to the surface in goat skins and run into reservoirs From the reservoirs the water is in two cases piped into the town to private house connections, in all the other cases the water is taken from the water reservoirs in' tins, skins and jars and is either carried to the private houses by hand or on donkey back. The wells lie at a distance of a mile to a mile and a half from the town. Water is sold in the town at the following rates One tin One baiza. One jar One baiza. One water-skin Two baizas. The owners of the wells do in some cases allow the poorer people to draw water free of charge. The water from these wells not used for drinking purposes is used to cultivate the land in the immediate neighbourhood. (b) Washing. Washing water, except in the few houses that actually have water connections from the two pipes from the Tuyan wells, is drawn from innumerable small shallow wells. The water from these lies close beneath the surface. They are mostly small in size and the water is drawn out with a rope and bucket. There are not a great number of the wells in the town itself but outside the wall*, every two or three houses have their own well. (c) Sanitation. There is no system. There are no latrine3 there is no method of removing the refuse human and animal. The sea shore and the streets are used as a latrine for those living in the town and hillside for those outside the town. Rubbish is thrown into the street and evil smelling drains run from some of the houses owned by the more wealthy people. They have no system of drainage and the few drains that there are come to a sudden end in the first open space and their contents spread and after thousands of flies have visited the place dries in the sun. Certain of the houses have indoor latrines, and sweep pits but they are not kept disinfected or in a proper state of repairs. There are no night soil carts and although there are local sweepers they are not energetic. The small amount of dry rubbish that they sweep up in some of the wider thoroughfares is carried out to the little bay near to the Consulate and dumped there. SUGGESTED SCHEME OF 7/ATER AND SANITARY CONTROL. 1. I propose to deal with the main problem first that is the provision of adequate supplies of water from mosquito proof sources for drinking and washing purposes. The ideal is a piped water supply to the town with house connections for those that can afford them and stands with press taps in the public places for the poor people whose means do not permit them the luxury of a connect ion. Unfortunately I do not think that the State and Municipal finances will be able to bear the cost of such a system, with its attendant drainage requirements. The scheme that I am going to suggest therefore has this ideal as the eventual goal to be reached but is very simple and can be introduced at once. (a) A survey should be made of the small brackish water wells and all those that are not necessary should be closed imme diately. In each area one well should be left open to supply the needs of the houses in the neighbourhood. This well must be fitted with a coping and a wooden cover. Every three days it must be / inspected byinspected by a sanitary official and a small quantity of cotton seed oil must be poured in. This should be done after dark ¥tfien all the water required for the day has been drawn. This survey will have to be very carefully done and only the bare minimum of wells must be left open. A Municipal, law must be passed to make it a penal offence for persons to open wells with out a Municipal permit. These permits must only be given when the needs of the population really require it. (b) Wells at Tuyan and elsewhere used solely for agricultural purposes must be daily treated with cotton seed oil after the daily drawing of water has been completed and be provid ed with wooden covers. The reservoirs into which the water is drawn must either be emptied every forty-eight hours and allowed to remain empty and dry for at least three hours or else they should be provided with proof covers. The expense of these covers to be borne by the owners. The owner must also provide outlet pipes at the bottom of the reservoirs for draining. (c) Wells at Tuyan used solely for drawing water for drinking purposes should be provided with wooden covers. The . reservoir into which the water is drawn must be properly proofed with wire-gauze at the owner's expense. There must be a sanitary official on duty at Tuyan to see that the wells are properly covered when water is not actually being drawn from them and that those that are to be disinfected with cotton seed oil are so dealt with at the proper times. Cd) A small pump and engine should be purchased from State funds and installed in one of the Sultan's wells as an experiment. The pump should be experimented with to test the maximum output of the well and the recovery period so as to arrive at a economic rate of pumping. The maximum requirements of the town should be ascertained for drinking water and washing purposes and further experiments made to ascertain if the wells when driven / by pump© ;S&gt; by pump can provide the town with sufficient water. It is real ised that they do meet the drinking water requirements at present but in the event of it being found possible to pipe a general supply into the town the population will almost certainly use this water for washing as well as drinking and it will be impossible to prevent this. In order to discourage the use of this water for washing purposesit may be necessary to work the stands only at fixed times and to make a small charge for water. The charge would be half that at present levied. If the wells can cater for washing as well as drinking so much the better as then it will be possible to close all the small brackish welJ.s. If it is found that the output is sufficient then a large reservoir will have to be constructed at Tuyan in the vicinity of the wells and filled. The water will flow by gravity to the town. The wells can be used in rotation, to fill the reservoir and thus allow a maximum recovery period for each well. The cistern or reser voir should be sufficiently large to allow a small reserve to permit the r wells being rested should it be necessary. In the town house connection will be provided at the occupant’s expense and a small annual or monthly charge will be levied on all persons having such connections. Note . In an appendix to this scheme the estimated cost of wooden covers for wells, proofing reservoirs, piping a supply to the town, providing stands of taps, and pumpfc and engines is given. The estimates are rough but will give a general idea of cost. 2. Sanitary System . (a) Sanitary Inspectors. Five sanitary inspectors should be engaged. The town and immediate neighbourhood should be divided into four zones. One being at Tuyan, two in the walled town, and the fourth in the market and Baharani Quarter. These zones should each be alloted one inspector on a wage of Rs. 20/- a month. / The fifthThe fifth inspector should be required generally to supervise the work of the other four and replace any that may be sick* This fifth man should be paid Rs. 30/- a month. These inspectors will supervise the work of the sweepers alloted to their areas. They will report all cases of nuisance. They will inspect all reported cases of stagnant water being left about and will be responsible that the regulations regarding the use of wells in their area are observed. The market inspector will be paid an extra wage of Rs. 3/- for the daily inspection oi the market. Clear and simple rules must be drawn up for the guidance of these inspectors. (b) Sweepers. A force of eighteen sweepers and one head sweeper should be engaged. These men should be paid Rs. 15/- and the head sweeper Rs. 30/— a month. They will be divided up among the quarters of the town in accordance with the amount of work to done. They will be responsible for the cleaning of the public latrines and the highways. The public latrines will normally be cleaned at night* and the refuse will be conveyed in two night soil carts to a special dhow in which the latrine buckets will be taken out to sea and emptied. Three sweepers should accompany the dhow and should wash the latrine buckets. The dhow should be hired by the month or purchased as seems most convenient and economical. These carts will be purchased by the Municipality and the drivers be paid Rs. 15/- a month and will be responsible for the care of the donkeys used to draw the carts. The dry refuse will be collected and taken by cart every morning to a selected site where will be constructed incinerators. (c) Latrines. Twelve public latrines and urinals will be constructed at selected places depending on the density of the population. These latrines will be made of cement and local stone and will be of the six seat variety. One spare bucket for each seat must be provided. They will cost about Rs. 60/- each. In addition four sump pits will be made. It is not considered / necessary8 t , necessary to have more sonstructed as many of the houses have their own pits. A reasonable number of collecting centres for dry refuse should be made into which the local inhabitants may throw their house-hold rubbish. These centres will be cleaned regularly by sweepers. (d) Market. The market is not large enough. A separate meat market is very necessary and should be constructed as soon as possible. It should not be wire-gauzed. The proper use of dis infectants will be sufficient combined with ordinary cleanliness to discourage flies. Stalls should be provided outside the present fish market for some of the fish merchants. These will be in expensive to make and will consist of cement platforms and a cement roof. The market should be disinfected daily with Jeyes Fluids A sump pit should be provided. A daily rent should be charged for the stalls and it should be forbidden to sell fish other than in the market. In Aden I believe that the rate is eight annas a day but I consider that that is too high for Muscat and that four annas would be enough. These amounts should be credited in the sanitary account towards the pay of the sanitary staff and the eventual improvement of the sanitation. (e) Mosques. The proprieters of mosques or the Waqf Committee should be responsible for the sanitation of the mosques. They should be made to ensure that water for washing purposes is not allowed to remain longer than forty-eight hours without being changed. The supply for washing places should be from an enclosed cistern with a tap or taps as is the practice in India. The cistern to have a man hole on the top for cleaning purposes. In the event of it being necessary to provide latrines at the mosque the cost thereof should be borne by the mosque. (f) Dogs. There are numbers of stray dogs that do not add to the cleanliness of the town. The Officer Commanding the Levy at Bait-al-Fala^j should be asked to detail a reliable Non-Commission- / ed Officer*/ vision of 9 ed Officer to shoot all stray dogs. He should be accompanied by a sweeper who should dispose off the body. General. (a) Regulations. Sanitary regulations will have to be 3 drawn up and penalties prescribed for breaches of the regulations. For example it should be an offence to throw refuse in the streets or to commit a nuisance in the public street or other public place including the foreshore. In addition to the normal fine imprisonment should be prescribed for those that cannot pay a fine. The regulations should empower the inspectors on receipt of information that sump pits etc. are not being properly cared for to enter buildings, after reasonable notice, to inspect and report. In the event of house-holders failing to keep their sanitary fittings in repair they should be repaired by Government and the cost of such repairs charged to the householder. Hospitals should be required to keep records of all cases of malaria treated and report cases of local infection to the Municipality at once so that the local inspector of the locality can be instructed to make a careful investigation into the cause of infection. These regulations will have to deal with any number of other subjects and will require careful drafting. * Note i- The new Ifunicipal regulations should contain clauses requiring the plans of all new buildings to be submitted to the Municipal Committee for approval before building is commenced. The Committee must ensure that proper Sanitary arrangements are introduced before passing the plans. . — _ , ■■■-—r^r M !■ ■■■■I'.— mmr- suggest that it be calculated on the assessed rent of the house.

This is most important subject as no system of sanitary control can be run without funds. taxation for the improvement of sanitation will be justified^ only il it is certain that the money so collected is devoted to the purpose for which it was collected and is not diverted to other objects. Money can be obtained by the introduction of a Sanitary Tax and by the introduction of market fees as already mentioned. The Sanitary Tax should be levied on the occupiers of permanent structures. I suggest that it be calculated on the assessed rent of the house. The rent of the house can be assessed by a small Sub-Committee composed of Muscat and British subjects working under the super-© 10 vision of the Chairman of the Municipal Committee. The rate suggested is one and a half anna in the rupee for rented buildings. The owner to be responsible for payment. Owner occupied houses should be required to pay one anna in the rupee.»o. 0.^^7.6808, politl*al Agency, Muscat.

JJ. .P.A&lt; Anti-malarial inspection of the reservoirs at Tuyan. In company with Saiyid Hilal Badr I inspected 5 reservoirs at Tuyan on the evening of I7th December. The results are as follows •- 1. Reservoir of Haji Zubair.... mosquitoes found breeding. The larvae of anopheline and culex mosquitoes were taken from this reservoir. 2. R. of His Highness.•• Was not able to get into this reservoir as there is no entrance. 3. R. of Mohd. Khan ... nothing found. 4. R. of Moosa Abdurrahman ••• nothing found. 5 # R. of Haji Almas ... locked. On the return journey I called in at the garden of His Highness where S. Hamid bin Hamood is living. This boy is always going sick with malaria. The only large place for water is a *Hammam* which was empty. However in the grounds there was a Persian ’Hub’ which had the supply of drinking water. This was teeming with mosquito larvae. It was emptied immediately. There were no other collections of water. Conclusions.... The fact that one reservoir at Tuyan had mosquito larvae shows that this is the main source -of mosquito breeding. Prom here the larvae are distributed by the bhisties in their skin bags to houses throughout the town.- This I know to be a fact as ximlixK larvae have been brought to my house by bhisties when they bring the daily bath water supply. Standing water in containers, like the hub seen at the house of S.Hamid bin Hamood, which are never completely emntied, are a fruitful source of breeding. These sources are I think the main sources of malaria in the towns. On a previous occasion I saw similar larvae in the house of Rai Sahib Dhuli Chand, though he was emphatic that no breeding was taking place in his house. 18/12 — mmmmmmM.o. $au/t ffrk . fe/l*.

AFRIDI, M.D., D.T.M. &amp; H., I.M.S., and JEMADAR SYED ABDUL MAJID, I.M.D. (Malaria Institute of India) (Indian Research Fund Association.) CONCLUSIONS The endemicity of malaria in Bahrein was closely associated with anophelism in most localities. As a general rule the severity of the disease in the villages and towns was found to depend upon their proximity to the waterlogged palm groves, which provided extensive-breeding places for the vector species, A.Stephens! . In such places localized minor epidemic outbreaks attended with enhanced mortality may occur of which Galali, a village in Muharrak Island, will serve as an example. In July 1929, an artesian well was sunk in the centre of this village, the outflow from which was utilized for the irrigation of a plantation situated on a low-lying ground close to its periphery. From our visual impression we came to the conclusion that the drainage oi this garden could not have been possible, and the local information that a considerable number of pools were formed in and around the plantations was therefore correct. Malaria broke out in an epidemic form in April and May 1930, as the result of which the artesian well was closed and the garden uprooted in December 1930. Thereafter the endemicity of malaria returned to its former proportions, and the local2 ■■ population is definitely of the opinion that the severity and the extent of the disease have decreased considerably. In Rifa-a-Ash Sharqi, however, conditions were strikingly different, as no breeding places were found nearer than in a garden situated at a distance of one to one and a half miles. The presence of malaria in this town could therefore be satisfactorily explained only if A.stephensi is assumed capable of long flights over that distance. Annual fluctuations in the prevalence of malaria do not occur to any marked degree, although there was evidence that the hospital attendances showed signilicant rise during the years 1923, 1927, 1930 and 1934. The immigra tion of foreign population after 1931 consequent upon the discovery of the oil fields does not appear to have exercised any marked effect on the malarial situation of the island. With regard to the prevalence of enlarged spleens in the different races inhabiting the islands, the spleen rates amongst the Arab, Bahrina and Iranian children examined in the Islands are shown in Table X. TABLE X. Total Number with Spleen rate Community number enlarged (per cent). examined spleen Arab 328 69 23.8 Bahrina 103 34 33 • 0 Iranian 65 29 44.6 From Table X it will be seen that the Arab children, among whom are included the negroes and the hall-castes- 3 - showed the least number of enlarged spleens. As regards Bahrinas and Iranians, a higher spleen rate among the former is probably due to the location of their settlements in or near the gardens, while the high figures among the latter may indicate a higher racial susceptibility. SUMMARY 1. A malaria survey of the Islands ol Bahrein and Muharrak situated in a gulf of the Arabian coast was carried out. ' 2. A general description oi the localities surveyed is given. An important feature was the belt of palm grovel along the coastal tract of Bahrein Island irrigated by copious springs of warm ancJ slightly brackish water. 3. The seasons are those of temperate zone, viz., a rainless summer and a wet winter, but the climatic conditions are characterized by excessive heat and high humidity, es pecially during the months of July, August and September. 4. On the whole, malaria was found to prevail in a severe form throughout the islands. The severity oi the disease was in most places related to their proximity to the palm grove belt. A moderate degree of malaria was however noticed to occur even when a locality was situated at some distai.ee from the gardens. 5. Mosquito breeding in the garden area varied with the type of irrigation in use, spring and artesian .well irrigations being more frequently associated with anophelism. The chieffactors in causing mosquito production were excessive irrigation and inadequate drainage. 6. The domestic sources of breeding were confined to shallow wells and private gardens. 7. Of the anophelines encountered A.stephensi was the only species found infected in nature. This was the pre dominant species prevalent in the larval and the adu.Lt xor.ns and is responsible for malaria in Bahrein. 8. The breeding habits and the behaviour of adult A.Stephens! are discussed. 9. Recommendations regarding the temporary ana permanent measures for the control of malaria in Bahrein are given in detail. Vertical drainage is suggested as the method of choice for the relief of waterlogging. The use of paris green and the local larvivorous fish Aphanius (Lepias) dlspar (Ruppell) is recommended for the control of anopheline breed ing places in houses and in the palm groves.JJgUIJgp © !

Gill, I.M.S. (pp. 190 - 235)(pp. 207-212) IV. THE ANOPKELINES OF MUSCAT No previous information appears to exist concerning the anopheline fauna of Muscat; indeed with the exception of the work of Patton (5) (1905) and Christophers and Khazan Chand (6) (1915) the Arabian anophelines seem to have attracted singularly little attention. The facts recorded below are the result of observations extending throughout the period from December 1914 to January 1916, As regards space the observations were re stricted to the area within about one mile of the camp of the garrison, to the town of Muscat, and to the villages of Sidab and Darsait. In the first named area systematic observations, usually at fortnightly intervals, were made throughout the above period; the other localities were visited at longer and more irregular intervals. During the year 1915 the following species were encountered; the specific identification was in all cases either made or con firmed by Major S.R. Christophers, C.I.E., I.M.S., of the Central Malaria Bureau, Kasauli, India, .whose assistance in this and in many other respects I take this opportunity of acknowledging. (1) A.

Vol.III, No.l, July 1915.of , oiling ! , breeding continued in this collection of surface (rain) water until the month of February when the pond was finally drained and filled up. A few larvae were also found in wells and the masonry 1, cisterns in connexion therewith during the months of February and March 1915. From April until the beginning of Sep tember the periodical examination of the wells and other available breeding places in the vicinity of the Fort yielded a negative re sult so far as this species was concerned. Larvae were again found in the wells in fair numbers from October to the end of the year. In the town of Muscat the majority of the wells examined during the months of October, November and December 1915 contained the larvae of this species; in many of the cisterns they were present in great numbers. In the village of Sidab most of the wells and the cisterns contained larvae during these months; the same remark applies to the village of Darsait. The only point worthy of note in connexion with this species is that, as noted by Christophers and Khazan Chand in the case of Aden, A.culicifacies is largely a well-breeder in Muscat. It ap pears to prefer shallow to deep wells, though it was found in wells 30 feet in depth. It was more abundant in unused or little-used wells; it was frequently absent from wells used in connexion with land irrigation from which the water is raised in skins during part of both the day and the night. A favourite type of breeding place in Muscat was a shallow well of 10-12 feet in depth with a diameter of 18-24 inches (of which a considerable number exists in the suburbs of the town) which are largely used by negroes as a source of drinking water. Though a well-breeder this species breeds freely in, and indeed appears to prefer, surface water collections if tnese oe available it was found in greater abundance in these and in masonry cistern than in the v/ells.- 3 - Adults were captured in the vicinity of the camp in small numbers from November 1914 to February 1915; they were at no time numerous. (2) A,S tephen si - This species was not encountered until October 1915 when it was found breeding in small numbers in a cistern in the village of Darsait. A few weeks later larvae were found in considerable numbers in the pool of brackish water in the outskirts of Muscat. In these two situations breeding con tinued until the end of the year. No adults were at any time captured. It is noteworthy that this species, which is a well-known well-breeder in Indian towns, was not found in wells in Muscat, although these form the chief available breeding grounds in this region. (3) A.rho desiensjis - This species was identified by Major Christophers who described its adult and larval characters in the Indian Journal of Medical Research.(6) (July, 1915). It, there fore, only remains to add here a few remarks regarding its seasonal prevalence and habits. The larva was not met with in any of the breeding grounds under observation until March 1915 when it was found to be present in great abundance in the pools of surface water in the bed of the nullah to the south-east of the Fort. Shortly afterwards its larvae were found in small numbers in the wells, in the under ground aqueduct and in its tank (Hauz). The species continued to be prevalent throughout the month of April and the first half of May; thereafter it decreased and in July active breeding appeared to have ceased. It again re-appeared in the wells in October and thereafter, until the end of the year, a few larvae could usually be found in this situation and in the fala j_. The pools in thewmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmKf mmm mm - 4 - nullah had by this time dried up. Adults were caught readily in the Fort during March and April and some recently fed specimens were captured inside mosquito curtains, thereafter search failed to reveal adults in an improvised mosquito trap or elsewhere. The breeding grounds of this species were not so closely associated with human habitations as in the case of the previous species; indeed larvae were occasionally found long distances away from the nearest village; the adult, however, appears to possess the habits of a domestic rather than a wild species, and there is reason to believe that it feeds on man. (4) A* funestus var arabica - This species which was thought to be A.listoni (Liston) was identified and named by Major Christophers whose description and reasons for according it varietal rank of A.funestus (Giles) are given in the reference already referred to. (6) This species was found breeding in the underground aqueduct and in the hauz in connection therewith where the water always had a perceptible current. When the hauz was emptied and allowed to refill full-grown larvae were invariably washed down. It was at no time found elsewhere. In this situation it was present in fair, and sometimes in considerable, numbers from November 1914 to April 1915. In May larvae became more scarce whilst only occasional specimens could be captured during June and July. Thereafter it was not seen again until the month of October from which date until the end of the year a few specimens could usually be captured, but it was never present in such abundance as in the preceding autumn and early winter. Adults were captured in considerable numbers from November 1914 to January 1915 and thereafter occasional specimens were seen up to March 1915, after which date no more were taken.- 5 - The adult appears to rest during the day on the sides of the aqueduct immediately above its breeding place. The chief point of interest in regard to this species is the fact that its breeding place appears to be strictly confined to water exhibiting a perceptible current. (5) A.cinere us - No complete description of this African species being available, the identification must remain, for the present, in doubt. Adults and mounted larval skins were sent to Kasauli, but owing to the absence of Major Christophers on field service his confirmation is lacking. Larvae of this species were found breeding in a tank in a priv et garden in Muscat during the month of December. No adults were captured. (6) A.rossii - It is perhaps of even more interest to note the absence of this species in Muscat than it would be to record its pres ence. At Major Christophers suggestion a special search was made to discover its presence but invariably with a negative result. MALAR IA 1 CARRIERS r_ A.cu licif acies , A.funestus and A.St ephens! are well-known car riers of malaria and from its wide distribution and prevalence one cannot help surmising that the first named is probably largely con cerned in the spread of the disease in Muscat. Unfortunately no dis sections were carried out. During the early stages of the enquiry the necessary apparatus was not available, whilst later the time was awaited (which never matured) when naturally fed adults would be ob tained in sufficient numbers to afford a fair prospect of discovering infected specimens. The anopheline fauna of Muscat, therefore, appears to consist of five species, all of whom belong, according to the classification of Christophers, to the deuter o-a nopheles and in his amended nomen clature to the expanded genus 'Myzomyia' (Blanchard) in which are- 6 - sunk the old genera Myz o myia , Neocellia , Pyretophorus and a few others. It is also of interest to note that three out of the five species are distinctly African anophelines while the re maining two are typically Indian species. The anopheline fauna of Muscat is thus a reflection of the geographical position of Arabia. (B) BREEDING PLACES OF ANQPHELIflES Considering all species together the main facts regarding their breeding places are exhibited in the following table (Table II).

Suitable pools were found and examined on several occasions in the vicinity of Matrah and Sidab but invariably with negative results.-7- (C) SEASOMAL PREVALENCE OF.ANOPEELIMES From the remarks already made some idea will have been gained of the seasonal prevalence of species: the following table (Table III) depicts the facts in a more comprehensive and con venient manner. TABLE III i _i i l ——__ i. 1 1 1. 1 Species Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec.

If the above table be compared with Table I in which the rainfall figures are recorded it will be seen that some degree of relationship exists between the monthly incidence of the rainfall and the prevalence of anophelines. The breeding places are, however, all of a permanent nature and are thus not markedly affected by rainfall. It would indeed appear that if any climatic circumstance .influences the monthly prevalence of anophelines then, in view of the general decrease of all species during the hot weather, temperature is at least as important a factor as rainfall. It is, however, possible for the rainfall to influence the number of potential breeding places very considerably. Thus, ifas occurred in 1914, rain falls during the hot weather a large number of potential breeding places are formed amongst the volcanic rocks, in the nullah beds, and in other low-lying situations. At this time, in spite of the great heat, little evaporation takes place (owing to the high atmospheric humidity) so that most of such pools remain throughout the following cold weather when they serve to increase the number of potential breeding places to a material extent.f -ialk; nearly two million pairs will be produced this year, and -that implies the production not only of vast stores of leather but of leather better than India has been accus tomed to produce. Woollen factories are busy for socks. Factories all over the country, as well as tens of thousands of village families are busy on blankets and netting and newar and a hundred other products. Food too has to be collected, packed and transmit- j ted. The talk told of one order ! for 20 tons of tinned fish, in one pound tins, that was met in 48 hours. Of the soldier’s requirements to-day, Mr. Hamilton said, more than 85 per cent can be produced in India. The problems to be grap pled with are legion; problems of material, labour, design, transport But what is being done means a large distribution in towns and countryside of money in wages and purchases, and a large market for cotton and other prime commodities in India which in considerable measure compensates for the wartime loss of outside markets. A fifteen minutes’ talk could draw attention to only a little of what trade organizations in India are doing to meet the call of the time, but it gave proof that they are competently answering the call, as producers and distribu- ' tors. A NEW HOPE. (The Sunday Statesman, Sept. 28J According to Colonel G. Covell, Director of Malaria Institute of India, experiments in Delhi Prov ince and in Coorg and Madras Presidency encourage the hope that India has at last available an effective weapon against malaria in rural areas in the spraying of dwellings with pyrethrum insecti-jl cides. He forecasts that this measure * * will be very largely used in military campaigns in malarious countries, and already six units have been formed and equipped at the field station of the Institute in Delhi N and have been sent to the Middle East. In its Resolution of May 23, 1941, the Government of India admitted that malaria “stands out as uni versally prevalent in India, that it maims as well as kills, and causes more sickness, misery and death than any other single disease.” Lt.- Colonel J. A. Sinton, a former Director of the Malaria Survey of India, estimated in 1935 that malaria is directly and indirectly the cause of at least two million deaths each year in India. In desperation he wrote: “The plea of the sanitarian and of the malariologist is too often as the voice of one crying in the wilderness. India is like Prome theus bound by chains of apathy to the rock of expediency and financial stringency, while the • vulture of malaria devours the vitals of her people.” To any who might think that in over-populated India two million deaths were no cause for sLL Sinton’s answer! li 'ft,. 3T ‘ - ^ (M- V' (U.

The want of a cheap remedy has stood hitherto in the way of a mass drive against the evil. A remedy suitable of universal application _— 4 I seems now to have been discovered 1 ! It was the reports of the successful control of malaria epidemics in rural areas in South Africa that led to the cultivation of pyrethrum in a number of localities in India in recent years. Samples of flowers grown in Kashmir, in Palampur and Kulu, in the neighbourhood of Peshawar, in the Kurrum Valley and in the Nilgiri Hills have been found to give excellent results. Pro duction in Kashmir is reported to be most advanced. It is stated that since the flowers so far produced in India are of superior quality to those grown in Japan and equal to those produced in Kenya there is scope for an export trade in them. An encouraging feature is that flowers of high quality can be pro duced in a number of different localities, so that no one can secure a monopoly of the industry. But in order that pyrethrum may be used on a large scale in India for anti mosquito work it should be pro duced at a cost not exceeding 4 to 6 annas per lb. for the dried flower. In Kenya the cost of production is not higher, and it is probable that the crop can be grown profitably at this figure in India. At present the local product costs more than the imported partly because cultivation of pyrethrum is limited to small plots and Kashmir is its chief producer. The immediate needs of the country may be met by increas ing the acreage many times. During the present war spray killing of adult mosquitoes with pyrethrum insecticides has proved by far the best means of securing immediate and effective control of malaria, and experts have described systematic spraying as the only measure immediately effective against a malaria epidemic in pro gress. It .is effective not only against mosquitoes but against sandflies, house flies and other insect pests, and may prove a strong defensive weapon against invasion by yellow fever. Both as a war industry and as a measure of social and economic importance the matter requires early attention, and large scale tests should not strain unduly the resources available for rural uplift and social services. ^temples.

Tests on the efficacy of 'Pyrocide 20” (a sample of which was supplied by Messrs. Kerr &amp; Co.) were carried out at Sonarpur. As recommended by the manufacturers^ I used a 5 per cent solution of 'Pyrocide 20' in kerosene. The tests were carried out in two rooms with a cubical content of 1880 c. ft. and 1340 c. ft. respectively. After spraying a measured quantity of the mixture with an atomiser, cages containing a counted number of mosquitoes were introduced and left in the rooms for 10 to 30 minutes. The cages were then taken out and the number of mosquitoes that were found dead after one hour was counted. The results are given in the appended table. The tests were carried out at temperatures of 86.5° and 87° F. and at humidities ranging between 80 and 83 per cent. By first diffusing the insecticide in the rooms prior to introduction of mosquitoes the chances of direct hit was entirely eliminated.PYROCIDE 20 STANDARDIZED EXTRACT OF PYRETHRUM FLOWERS Under the conditions of these tests and at floor level, a mortality of 32.5 per cent was observed in a dilution of 1 c. c. in 300 c. ft. and exposure of 10 minutes, and a mortality 72 per cent in a dilution of 1 c. c. in 200 c. ft. and exposure of 15 minutes. In dilutions varying between 1 c. c. in 107 c. ft. and 1 c. c. in 200 cubic feet, and exposures ranging from 20 to 30 minutes the mortality was from 76 per cent to 100 per cent. At a level of 5 to 6 feet from floor level a dilution 1 c. c. in 300 c. ft. and exposure of 10 minutes the mortality was low (10 per cent). At the same level, with dilutions of 1 c. c. in 107 c. ft. to 1 c. c. in 200 c. ft. and exposures of 20 to 30 minutes, the mortality ranged between 62 to 95 per cent. These tests are subject to certain defects. As the tests were done in a large sized room (cubic content^ 1340 c. ft. and 1880 c. ft.) the distribution of the insecticidP in different parts of the room may not be uniform. Secondly, as the mosquitoes were kept enclosed in small mosquito cages they did not come in full contact with the insecticide vapour as diffusion of the vapour may to a PY STANDA certain exte presumed t mosquitoes enclosed in the mosquii By the mortality e thin spray To ; found to in 100 to minutes 80 to 95 effect o ^han at : Carried c per cent diminish' insecticide of lower© PYROCI.DE 20 STANDARDIZED EXTRACT OF PYRETHRUM FLOWERS certain extent be prevented by the mosquito netting. It is presumed that the mortality would have been higher if mosquitoes were liberated into the room instead of being enclosed in cages. Owing to the difficulty of collecting the mosquitoes again, that procedure was not employed. By the direct hit method, there was 100 per cent mortality even when the insecticide was applied as a very thin spray by means of a fine atomiser. To summarise, a 5 per cent solution of Pyrocide was found to be a very effective insecticide. A dilution of 1 c.c. in 100 to 200 c. ft. of air space and an exposure of 20 to 25 minutes gave a mortality among anopheles mosquitoes of 80 to 95 per cent. As the vapour is heavier than air, the effect of the insecticide was greater near the floor level ^han at 5 to 6 feet above the floor level. The tests were Carried out when the relative humidity was higher (80 to 83 per cent). It is known that the efficacy of insecticides diminishes with increasing humidity and it is likely that this insecticide would be even more effective under conditions of lower relative humidity. The addition of citronella ■■■■■PYROCIDE 20 STANDARDIZED EXTRACT OF PYRETHRUM FLOWERS oil to the extent of 2 per cent appears to increase the efficiency and serves to mask the odour of kerosene. Anopheline mosquitoes were more rapidly killed than culicines. The cost of the insecticide as compared with those of proprietory preparations on the market is low. A 5 per cent solution of Pyrocide 20 containing 2 h per cent citronella oil would cost about Rs. 2-10-0 per gallon. The quantity of insecticide required would be approximately 1 oz. for every 4,000 c. ft. Entomologist, Bengal Public Health Department. The 10 th June 1937 .

KERR 6* Co. 125, ESPLANADE ROAD, BOMBAY.m w/ PYROCIDE 20 - DEODORIZED, CLARIFIED • Since 1929 Pyrocide 20 has been known as the original, standardized pyrethrum concentrate. Always recognized as the standard of the industry, Pyrocide 20 has led in the continuous improve ment of pyrethrum extracts. In 1936 we introduced Improved Pyrocide 20 which was characterized by its clear amber color, better odor and brilliant clarity when diluted with odorless base oils. Improved Pyrocide 20 was a distinct advance in the manufacture of pyrethrum concentrates. Since its introduction, our sales have been larger than for any preceding year. • As a further step toward producing the purest form of pyrethrins commercially practicable, we now offer Pyrocide 20, Deodorized, Clarified. This new product is the finest pyrethrum concentrate we have ever made. No other pyrethrum extract meets these specifications for Pyrocide 20: 1. Pyrethrin Content: 2.5 per cent by weight, or 2.0 grams per 100 cc. 2. Retains its strength. Stabilized with antioxidant that has been proved effective by laboratory tests and commercial use over two years. 3. Killing Power: Guaranteed equal or better than any extract of equivalent pyrethrin content. 4. No “false pyrethrins”: Patented process removes materials which are not pyrethrins but which react like pyrethrins when assayed by the Seil method. Unless removed these substances give a higher apparent pyrethrin content than is actually present. 5. Odor: Made only with odorless base oil. Practically free from odor, excepting the natural floral aroma of pyrethrum. No kerosene used in Pyrocide 20. 6. Color: Rich amber. Free from colloidal, green coloring matter. Makes a rich-looking, sparkling yellow spray when diluted for use,—not a weak, watery-looking spray. 7. Clarity: Dilutes brilliantly clear with any base oil. Chilled to 0° C. to remove resins and other materials which cause clouding. Remains clear either in concentrated form or when diluted for use. 8. Economy: No increase in price for improved odor—improved color—improved stability- improved clarity. Requires 3^ to ^ ^ ess perfume. — 2 —— 3 — The tube on the left contains Pyrocide 20 just as it was formerly supplied throughout the world for years. The tube on the right contains Pyrocide 20 Deodorized, Clari fied, as now offered, made with special deodorized base oil. ^^Our manufacturing process removes many of the impurities which are present in certain types of extracts. These impurities interfere with the usual assay methods, showing, in some cases, a higher pyrethrin content than is actually present. Pyrocide 20 makes a brilliantly clear solution when diluted with 19 parts of deodorized oil base or kerosene. Being much purer than ordinary concentrates, staining is practically eliminated. The photograph of the graduated cylinder shows the brilliance of finished spray made with Pyrocide 20. This finished spray was made by simply diluting one part of Pyrocide 20 with 19 parts of oil and was not filtered. The small, round photograph is an actual “shot” taken vertically through £ twelve inches of solution in the cylinder illustrated. The printing which was placed under the cylinder is clearly legible through the twelve inch column of finished spray. Pyrocide 20 is nearly odorless except for the pleasant aroma of pyrethrum flowers. These improve ments in Pyrocide 20 have been made without increasing the cost to you. Samples of Pyrocide 20 will be sent you, without charge, on request.FACTS ABOUT PYRETHRUM • Pyrethrum is the dried flower heads of Pyrethrum cinerariaejolium. To the casual observer the flowers resemble the field daisy. The latter, however, is not toxic to insects, while pyrethrum is one of the most toxic materials known. • There are several other species of pyrethrum which are used as insecticides, but Pyrethrum cinerariaejolium is the only species which is of real commercial im portance. • Pyrethrum has been used as an insecticide for more than a century. It was introduced into this country about I860. Until 1914, nearly all pyrethrum used in the United States was imported from Dalmatia. Since then supplies have been received principally from Japan, which today supplies more than 90% of our requirements. Within the last few years, a very fine grade of flowers has been imported in small quantities from Kenya Colony, East Africa. • The insecticidal properties of pyre thrum are due to the pyrethrins. These two active principles, pyrethrin I and pyrethrin II, were first isolated, identified, and named by Staudinger and Ruzicka in 1916.^17 • The pyrethrins are highly Stripping flower heads from freshly harvested flowers. STRIPPER HAS TEETH LIKE A COMB. (JAPAN). The metal complicated chemical compounds which are not very stable to light and air. They are extremely toxic to coldblooded animals, such as insects, fish, frogs, crabs, and turtles. To warm-blooded animals, however, the pyrethrins are harmless when taken by mouth. In this respect, pyrethrum is unique among insecticides. It was thought that derris, cube, and other rotenone bearing insecticides shared this property with pyrethrum, but it has recently been shown that derris is quite toxic when administered to warm-blooded animals by mouth.^2^Q *1 CHEMICAL EVALUATION OF PYRETHRUM • There are fifteen methods for determining one or both of the pyrethrins quantitatively. The methods most in use today are the Gnadinger copper reduction method and the Seil acid method. The Seil method, which is a modification of the Tattersfield method, has replaced the latter because it is easier to operate. Unfortunately, the Seil method gives high results as Gnadinger and Corl have shown^S^ Haller and Acree of the United States Department of Agriculture have shown that Seil’s method gives high results for the determination of pyrethrin II. {4} Wilcoxon has shown that the Seil method gives low results for pyrethrin 1.^5/ • Since the Gnadinger copper reduction method is applicable only to flowers, and the Seil method is to some extent discredited, the purchaser of pyrethrum extract is obliged to rely principally on the integrity of his supplier. • Purchasers of pyrethrum products who buy on a guaranteed pyrethrin content should ascertain by which method the pyrethrin con tent has been determined. BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF PYRETHRUM • Although many methods for evaluating pyrethrum products by means of tests against insects have been proposed, no satisfactory test has been devised. The Peet-Grady method for testing pyrethrum insecticides more nearly approximates the actual conditions under which household insecticides are used than any of the other biological methods. Unfortunately, the Peet-Grady method is by no means as accurate as the industry has been led to believe. This has been shown by the work of Gothard ^5/, Weed (1}, Murray {\2} and others. COMMERCIAL GRADES OF PYRETHRUM • The principal commercial grades of pyrethrum are Dalmatian, Japanese, and Kenya flowers. The pyrethrin content of Dalmatian flowers is from about .40% to 1.00%; that of Japanese varies from about .60% to 1.20%. Kenya flowers are richer in pyrethrins than the other kinds, frequently con taining as high as 1.45% pyrethrins. Construction of compressed bale of Japanese pyrethrum. Left, com plete bale; center, outer wrapping removed showing four sections; RIGHT, QUARTER BALE WITH MATTING REMOVED.EFFECT OF STORAGE, LIGHT, AND HEAT ON PYRETHRUM PRODUCTS • Ground pyrethrum loses a part of its activity, through decomposition of the pyrethrins, when exposed in thin layers to air and sunlight for a few days. When stored for several months in the dark, even in tins under partial vacuum, there is a pronounced loss of pyrethrins. Antioxidants apparently retard decomposition to some extent. Ground flowers even when stored in air-tight tins at room temperature for 6 months lose an appreciable amount of pyrethrins; similar samples stored at -2° to -5° showed no loss of pyrethrins in 6 months, but there was a noticeable loss in 11 months. Whole flowers also lose pyrethrins by decomposition in storage, but apparently at a slower rate than ground flowers. • The keeping quality of whole pyrethrum flowers is apparently influenced by the stage of maturity at which they are picked. Over-mature flowers decompose more rapidly than immature or nearly mature flowers. Pure pyrethrins decompose rather rapidly on exposure to air and sunlight or ultraviolet light. They are also rapidly decomposed when heated at 100° in air. When exposed to sunlight in nitrogen they do not decompose appreciably in 12 days. • Baling whole flowers does not prevent decomposition of pyrethrins during storage. There was little difference in the pyrethrin loss of uncompressed flowers and flowers baled under pressures of 5,000 to 16,000 pounds per square inch. Pyrethrins apparently decompose more rapidly in some oils than in others. This is probably due to the removal of natural antioxidants from the oils during refining. Antioxidants added to concentrated pyrethrum extracts prevent decomposition to a marked extent. Storage at 0° to 6° C. also inhibits decomposition. Sunlight accelerates the decomposition of oil extracts of pyrethrum. • Certain antioxidants are quite effective in preventing decomposition of pyrethrins in highly concentrated extracts ^8 to 15 per cent pyrethrins^. MANUFACTURE OF PYRETHRUM EXTRACTS • Pyrocide 20 was developed in 1929 to supply the demand for a concentrated extract of known and constant pyrethrin content. Pyrocide 20 was the first, and for several years the only, standardized pyrethrum extract on the market. It is manufactured by a special process covered by U. S. Patent 1,915,662. • The manufacture of Pyrocide 20 is in the hands of eight graduate chemists, and full and complete chemical control is maintained over all pyrethrum flowers received, and the extract made from them. Because of the large volume of sales of Pyrocide 20, we are able to employ this staff of technical men. It is only in this way that a product of uniform pyrethrin content can be economically manufactured. Our customers are thus enabled to avail themselves of the services of our technical staff without investing capital in a similar technical organization. • The manufacturer who percolates pyrethrum flowers direct with kerosene will have an insecticide of widely varying killing power, unless he is prepared to assay each batch of flowers just before percolating, and unless he increasesJOTS ins, when i the dark, pparently s at room i at -2 0 to hs.

New crop flowers harvested in May, June and July reach this country too late for use in the current insecti cide season. Most insecticide is manufactured between December and July, when the flowers have lost a considerable proportion of their activity. The manufacturer who uses pyrethrum flowers must ^)bear the cost of these losses, or, otherwise produce a variable and unsatisfactory insecticide, which will eventually destroy the confidence of his customers. We believe it will be found cheaper to use Pyrocide 20, even when the amount of insecticide produced per season is several hundred thousand gallons. • Pyrocide 20 is manufactured to make standardization of the killing power easy. It is a concentrated extract of pyrethrum, guaranteed to contain 2.5% pyrethrum or 2.0 grams of pyrethrins per 100 cc. • To make a household insecticide, add one gallon of Pyrocide 20 to 19 gallons of kerosene or deodorized base oil. 1 W r e guarantee the resulting insecticide to be effective, each gallon containing the active principles from one pound of pyrethrum flowers assaying .90% pyrethrins by the copper reduction method. Such an insecticide will meet, in every particular, the Specifica tions for Household Spray Type Liquid Insecticide, as issued by the National Association of Disin fectant and Insecticide Manufacturers. • Pyrocide 20 is not simply a “20 pound extract.” Each gallon may actually contain the active principles from 25 or more pounds of flowers. That is, if the •flowers used in the manufacture of Pyrocide 20 contain less than .90% pyrethrins when percolated, we must use a greater number of pounds per gallon, in order to maintain the guaranteed pyrethrin content. Thus, you always have full assurance that an insecticide made from Pyrocide 20 is uniform and high in killing power. • Some unscrupulous foreign shippers of pyrethrum flowers offer to supply flowers guaranteed to assay .90% pyrethrins. The customary terms of sale are against letter of credit so that the manufacturer buying such flowers has little recourse if the flowers do not contain the pyrethrins guaranteed. As a result, many reputable pyrethrum manufacturers, without labora-A VIEW OF OUR PLANT FOR MANUFACTURING CONCENTRATED PYRETHRUM EXTRACT. tory facilities of their own, relying on the guarantee of a far distant shipper, put out extracts of pyrethrum with a definite pyrethrin guarantee. Testing with flies will reveal only wide variations. A considerable number of such concentrates has been examined and they have been found to vary extremely in effectiveness, undoubtedly due to variations in the flowers used in their manufacture. • Consequently, when comparing the cost of Pyrocide 20 with other concentrates, it is important to know whether the manufacturer is actually in position to standardize his concentrate. • We cordially invite you to visit our plant and see it in operation. PYROCIDE 20 RETAINS ITS STRENGTH • Pyrocide 20 retains its strength practically indefinitely. Samples stored four months at 35 degrees C. {95 degrees F.y lost no strength whatsoever. Samples stored three years still meet our pyrethrin content guarantees, and have full killing power. Concentrates have been tested which lose strength at a fairly rapid rate during storage at room temperature. All pyrethrum products should be kept intightly sealed tin or iron containers in a cool place. Standard strength insecticides lose strength when packed in blue or flint glass, but not in amber glass, tin or iron. Some mineral oil solvents used in insecticides likewise deteriorate when exposed to light in glass bottles. Containers or tanks of copper, lead or zinc cause a heavy precipitate and change of color in pyrethrum extracts. • After all, the purchasing of pyrethrum products may be complicated or it may be very simple. We offer the best we know how to produce, at the lowest possible price. We have no secrets. We believe you will dis cover by your own means that Pyrocide 20 is the most satisfactory and economical source of supply for the active principles in your insecticides, even as hundreds of manufacturers have done all over the world. • Pyrocide 20 is especially suitable for use by foreign insecticide manufacturers. Where duties are based on volume or weight, the importer makes great savings by importing Pyrocide 20 as compared with a completed insecticide. Pyrocide 20 is used by manufacturers in more than 40 countries throughout the world. • Pyrocide 20 is offered in bulk quantities only to listed manu facturers of insecticides, and not to consumers, retailers or wholesalers. PYROCIDE 20 FOR HOUSEHOLD INSECTICIDES • Pyrocide 20 makes a clear solution when diluted with deodorized base oil, or kerosene. • When diluted with nineteen parts of base oil, Pyrocide 20 will make a first class household insecticide. If a deodorized oil is used, a very small amount of perfume will be sufficient. In some cases perfume may be entirely omitted. If kerosene is used, more perfume will be required. In some cases, a heavy naphtha, of the type used in paints as a turpentine substitute, is used. In any case, the base oil should have a flash point not lower than 120° F. In general, the base oil should have a boiling range of 350° F. and 510° F. • Manufacturers who use rotenone or derris in pyrethrum sprays should be sure that they are not infringing U. S. Patent 1,967,024. • Household insecticides should be packed in tin, to prevent decomposition by light. Cans with soldered seams or lead lined caps should not be used, because lead is attacked by the pyrethrum extract. • Instructions for labelling household insecticides were issued by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C, in a letter dated March 30, 1936. Copies of this letter can be obtained by addressing the Administration.— 10 — repellent action can be intensified by the use of steam distilled pine oil, other pine oils or pine oils. • An excellent livestock spray can be made in accordance with the following formula: 4 gallons 91 gallons 5 gallons Pyrocide 20 Gas Oil, 32° to 36° Baume Steam distilled pine oil, water free 100 gallons • The oil should be strictly within the gravity range specified, and should be as free as possible from sulfonatable hydrocarbons. The oil should be a straight run oil and not a blend of light and heavy oil to get the desired gravity. Lighter oils may blister the animals. If the oil is too heavy the killing power of the pyrethrum is materially reduced. • The opinions of the United States Department of Agriculture in regard to labelling of livestock sprays are given in a letter dated December 16, 1935. Copies of this letter may be obtained from the Food and Drug Administration, United States Depart ment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. PYROCIDE 20 FOR MOSQUITO LARVICIDES • The following is a formula for an improved mosquito larvicide by Ginsburg of the New Jersey Experiment Station.^9J 94 gallons Light fuel oil or kerosene Concentrated pyrethrum extract /containing 2.1 g. 5 gallons 1 gallon 6 pounds 50 gallons pyrethrins per 100 cc.) Defoamer Gardinol W. Cone Water 150 gallons • The defoamer is made by mixing equal parts of degras wool-grease and fuel oil or kerosene. Gardinol W. Cone, is prepared by sulfating technical lauryl alcohol; it is commercially available {Du PontJ. The defoamer is mixed with the fuel oil. The Gardinol is dissolved in the water, which is then transferred to a pressure sprayer tank. The pump and agitator are started and the oil is then added slowly. Pumping is continued for thirty minutes after all the oil is added and the mixture is then pumped off into drums. • This stock emulsion should be mixed with ten parts of water before applying. This diluted solution should be applied at the rate of approximately 50 gallons per acre. • A solution of this kind has been successfully used for protecting outdoor gatherings from mosquitoes.— 11 — PYROCIDE 20 FOR HORTICULTURAL SPRAYS • Pyrocide 20 has been used very successfully in several ways in horticultural sprays. Emulsified with soap as recommended by Haegle^lO^ it is very effective in controlling prune mineola, an important pest. The formula recommended by Haegle is as follows: Pyrocide 20 quarts Kerosene or dormant spraying oil 28 gallons Neutral soap pounds Water 15 g allons • The soap is dissolved in water. The Pyrocide 20, dissolved in the kerosene, is then slowly added to the soap solution while mixing. This strong emulsion is diluted for spraying, using 5 gallons to 95 gallons of water containing an additional 3J4 pounds of soap. This spray is applied liberally, about 5 gallons per tree, with 2 50 pounds pressure, and has controlled over 90% of prune mineola without damage to the trees. This same emulsion is effective against many other insects. • Lam- iman/T 1 } describes a new and unusual use for oil pyrethrum spray. The formula which Lamiman recommends is: Highly refined kerosene 87}/2 gallons Neutral oil {90% unsulfonatable and 60 viscosity^ 10 gallons Pyrocide 20 g allons This spray has been used successfully for controlling grape leaf hopper in California. No emulsi fying agent nor water is used. The spray is vaporized with a paint-gun type of nozzle at the rate of 2 to 5 gallons per acre, making it very economical. About 90% control is secured without injury to the vines. • Pyrocide 20 is packed in new steel drums, securely sealed, containing. u. s. Gallons Imperial Gallons Liters Approximate Weight, Lbs.

Most owners of ponds in private grounds have already recognized the value of mosquito fish in the pre vention of the mosquito nuisance and have rendered valuable assist ance both in care of the fish and in permitting removal of fish from over-stocked ponds to furnish other waters. Mr. H. C- Faulder (Malaria Prevention in Shanghai, China Journal, May 1939, pp305-312) asserts that the fish (Gambusia) have definitely proved of value in such places as ornamental ponds where the use of oil or other sprays might be objected to. The S.M.C. Public Health Depart ment maintains three large hatcher ies at Kiaochow Park and supplies of the fish are available, at the low ^ost of $50 per thousand, through the Deputy Chief Inspector, Malaria Pre vention whose staff will periodical- ly inspect fish-stocked ponds, replace losses, advise and assist gardeners in care of fish.. and how to look after them during the winter.'

Public Health Department Adapted &amp; Reproduced by the INDIAN RED CROSS SOCIETY. JQuestion .— Answer .—Ii goes by the nami of mankind. In get the disease f attacks persons causes very greal Question.—*■} Answer .—Tl headache, and acQuestion. —What is Malaria? Answer .—It is a very common disease in India and goes by the name of Fever. It is one of the worst enemies of mankind. In India every year about 60 million people get the disease and of these about one million die. It attacks persons generally during the rainy season and causes very great suffering and misery. Question.—How does one feel when one has the disease ? Answer .—The fever comes on with shivering, a bad headache, and aches and pains in the body.The next day or the third day the fever drops .and after an interval of a day comes on again. In this way the fever lasts a long time and the patient becomes weak and is unable to work. As an example look at the case of Ram Singh {fig. 1). He had suffe nobody else to su were starving ar •ornaments she { happened to pass her to send for thle fever drops .and gain. In this way ent becomes weak look at the case of He had suffered from fever for months, and there was nobody else to support his family. His wife and children were starving and she was on the point of selling the few ornaments she possessed when Pandit Gauri Shanker happened to pass by and stopped her (Jig. 2). He advised her to send for the Doctor.r MALARIA. The Doctor came and gave Ram Singh quinine {fig. 3). In a few days Ram Singh recovered {fig. 4) and in due time went to work and his family became happy again {fig. 5). Question .— How is the fever caused? Answer .—It is caused by a very tiny germ ( fig. 6) which lives and multiplies in our blood and thus poisons the body. Question .—How does it get into the blood ?Figure 6 quinine (fig. 3). and in due time again (fig. 5). ( fig. 6) which poisons the body. ? MALARIA. A nswer .—Through the Mosquito. The Mosquitoes that you see daily are great enemies. They bite a man who has fever and suck the poison from his blood and then when they bite a healthy person they give the poison to him and he gets the fever (fig. 7). Question .—Am I to understand that if there w T ere no mosquitoes there would be no Malaria ?Question. here do the mosquitoes live? Answer.--They live in houses (/ip. 8) near wells, tanks, cesspools and other collections of water [/ip. 9). Question .—How do they breed? Ansicer. Ihe female mosquito lays eggs on the water.Figure 10 th mosquitoes- ve ? 8) near wellsy {fa- 9). on the water- ing ? Answer. —You can do so :— (a) By filling the tanks and emptying the cesspools and vessels lying in and around your house (fig. 12).MALARIA. All rank vegetation overhanging the tank and th&amp; weeds in the tank should be removed except duckweed. (b) If tanks are too big for filling you can apply kerosine oil to the edges of the tank (fig. 13). The oil will spread and will not allow the little mosquito to breathe and they will die.MALARIA. 9 tank and the duckweed. you can apply . 13). The oil to breathe (c) Fishes (like the one you see in the picture) are also very fond of eating the little ones of mosc|uitoes. They should be stocked in tanks which have water throughout the year (Jig. 14). Question.—Is there no remedy to prevent the mosquitoes biting us ? Answer .—There is. You can do so as follows :—MALARIA. Figure (a) By sleeping under a mosquito-net. g | ee p^ ^ 15 )^ rubbing oil on y° ur bo(1 y before going to (r) Disinfect your house by burning Sulphur (J 9 . 16). Question. What should we do to escape if we cannot avoid mosquitoes biting us ? Answer.—Yon should take Quinine. It is the only remedy tor Malaria. J Remember rainy season fn quinine 15 grns. in all during the Question .— Answer.—1 dispensary, or £iMALARIA. 11 r ~ .. SEE HOW QUININE GUARDS THE SEPOY Fig. 18. LOOK AT THE FATE OF THE MAN WHO REFUSED QUININE Fig. 19. Remember that the disease is prevalent during the rainy season from July to November, and if you take quinine 15 grns. weekly during those months, say 25 times in all during the year you escape the disease. Question .—Where can we get Quinine? Answer. —Anywhere, in the village post-office, village dispensary, or from the village Mukia (Jig. 17).12 MALARIA. (1) Get rid of mosquitoes. (2) Get rid of pools and tanks. (3) Take Quinine during the rainy season. (4) Sleep under a mosquito-net or rub oil to your body.

It is practicab/le to wire-gauze the storage tanks at Tuyam but not the wells, unless some other method is used for drawing water, such as a pump. Water can be drawn off the tanks by means 2. of taps let into the side walls. 2. I am not nuite certain of the total number of v/ells in Muscat, as there are many in private houses. At Tuyam, the main source of the v/ater supply, there are about 10 wells and 8 storage tanks. The Hindoo temple has a well but no tank. The tscxkx' wells in other parts of the town, excluding private houses, I should put the figure to about SO.to 100. 3.Those wells which do not have ±hs a bull drawing v/ater, could be covered at a moderate cost. The storage tanks at Tuyam the P.W.D. Overseer tells me would cost from three to four hundred Rupees each, to cover. 4 I consider that 10 inspectors and 2 supervisors after a short training would suffice to commence with. The town could be divided into sectors with an inspector in charge of each. Each supervisor to have 5 inspectors and their sectors under him. Their work would be to inspect drinking water receptacles and other storage places for the presence of larvae in huts and private houses. Once a week t must be a 'Dry Hay 1 ', when all eee±xe±ke receptacles must be completl^ emntied and dried for one hour. The same day about one ounce of ’cotton seed’ oil should be p'oured into each well. This oil is harmless to human life. Possibl:/- 10 dollars per inspector and 15 per supervisor would | be an adenuate salary to attract a decent type of man who could be f reli is near the Customs Pier below Merani Port. This pool could easily be made into a cemented drain leading into the sea. Vo*'' 6. The obvious scheme to eliminate most of this/^inspection &amp;c would be, of course, to have a piped water supply throughout the town. If this could be gradually introduced into one sector of the town at a time all the wells could be cemented over and then the only places in that sector requiring supervision would be storage M.O. 8/5/39 i.Extract from notes onUan interview with His Highness 5&gt; Publie Health . I have obtained the following estimate of what it costs us yearly to enjoy malaria Private fees at Matrah hospital .Rs 3,000/-. Malaria treatment at Consulate Hospital... Rs 840/-. Private imports of quinine .Rs 770/-. Total Rs 4,610/-. (ii) . I estimate the population of Muscat, Matrah and adjoining villages at about 12,000; so we spend about 6 annas a head per annum on having malaria alone, or anna per month. Would it not be much better if it could be arranged for everyone to pay this small sum for prevention instead of cure? (iii) I asked Saiyid Abbas to discuss the question and understand that the present outlay on public health is:- 3 tins kerosene Rs 7/2/-. Aages................. ^s471/—/—. Total Rs 478/2/- per month. One anti-malaria squad of three men gets round Muscat in a week, and their wages are Rs 45/- per mensem. Could we have two squads for Matrah with six tins of kerosene? Could we also have a food-market inspector for Matrah at Rs 15/- to 20/- per month ? Total monthly increase Rs 129/4. Total monthly expenditure on publicj / health about Rs 600/-. (iv) As we can save Rs 4610/- private expenditure a year if we cut out onj_y Malaria, can funds be provided to build progressively four more public latrines, 3 in Matrah and 1 more in Muscat. Saiyid Abbas estimates cost | at Rs 500/- each. If the State began, Hindu and Khoja communities might each build one privately. H.H. agrees and has given me the Municipal Budget for 1942, with authority to discuss and revise in co-operation with Saiyid Hilal. Other communities may be addressed later. /u.

Most of the file's papers are reports on the current state of wells, drainage systems, agricultural ditches and water channels and their susceptibility to breeding species of malaria-carrying mosquitos, particularly the area of Tuyan. The latter half of the file indicates that the Muscat Municipality took on these efforts from the office of the Sultan who had initiated the anti-malaria campaign in 1938.The file also contains papers from a broad range of medical and scientific institutions outside of Oman enlisted to help with the anti-malaria effort in Muscat. This includes reports on the existing anti-malaria campaign in Bahrain, as well as extensive quotations and product descriptions of pesticide from India through the firm of F.S. Kerr and Co of Bombay. Finally, the file also contains an Indian Red Cross Society information and advice pamphlet entitled 'Malaria: the Mosquito Danger'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Red Cross Society</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Antimalarials</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mosquitoes</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Public health</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
