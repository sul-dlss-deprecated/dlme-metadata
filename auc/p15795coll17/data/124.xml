Growing up in a prominent family (her father a renowned physician who treated Umm Kulthum, a friend of the family, and her mother from an elite background), Handoussa describes aspects of the household like language, recreation, neighbors, and servants (like her Slovenian nanny). She recalls their farm in the Delta and how her family managed to avoid the financial ruin that came to others due to Nasser-era policies. She points to changes for women in Egypt by sharing stories of female relatives (some who joined Huda Shaarawi in abandoning the face veil) on topics like social interactions, dress, and education; she relates her own experiences attending a French language Catholic nun’s school. Admitted to undergraduate study at AUC in the early 1960s despite modest high school grades, Handoussa recollects faculty she studied with, campus social life, and a student body inclusive of the children of families made poorer by government sequestration but also President Nasser’s daughter. She speaks of her subsequent graduate education in London (and interaction with other foreign students there), and her return to Egypt in the mid-1970s where she worked with the government investment ministry and did part-time teaching at AUC. A full time faculty member from 1977, she provides a sketch of AUC’s Economics, Political Science, and Mass Communication Department at AUC and its leading faculty (with anecdotes about interactions with figures like economist Galal Amin). Faculty issues like unequal treatment and compensation with respect to full-time and part-time faculty and foreign and Egyptian faculty are addressed too. She offers insight into AUC students (whom she socialized with as a young professor), including their academic level (better in later years than when she attended) and career paths (embracing opportunities, like banking, made available due to Sadat era economic infitah). Handoussa discusses her position as Vice Provost from 1990 to 1992), including her goals and responsibilities, such as for research (which gave her insight into the obstacles caused by government bureaucracy). She tells of leaving the Vice Provost position when excluded from senior administrative deliberations. Handoussa gives a detailed account of her post-AUC career, including her role in founding the Economic Research Forum (ERF) for Arab countries in 1993, and her position on the Egyptian parliament’s Shura Council, where she made inquiries into matters like the Toshka desert development project. She also speaks about the part she played in setting up the Egypt Network for Integrated Development supporting Egyptian handicraft makers, especially rural women, drawing on her longstanding interest in local crafts.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
