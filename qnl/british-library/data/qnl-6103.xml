British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 9th September 1929. D.O. No. 416-S. 0 t + A I send you for comment a copy of Sir Gilbert Clayton’s demi-official letter no. S.O. 1748 of the 5th instant, to which 1 have not replied. The ’’unnecessarily alarmist” news sent by Burton was his No. 1/135 of 6 th July which elicited no. 74/S of 11th July from the High Commissioner. I have been looking up the telegrams relating to the appointment of a Special Service Officer at Kuwait and it appears that it was temporary and fora special purpose. More’s telegram no. 157 of the 25th February 1928 shows that originally the Iraq Officer was to accom pany car reconnaissances and. that Bent was willing to agree that he should be More’s assistant if the Resident preferred it. 1 have no copies of the demi-official correspon dence between Bent and More, but no doubt you will find them otf your files. We want to co-operate with the Royal Air Force and 02 give them all possible facilities provided we keep control until we state definitely that the situation has reached the t In stage when we resign it to the military. Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P. Bickson, C.I.E.m Copyybf deni-official letter Ho. S.O. 1748 (Secret), dated 5th September 1929, from H.*R. sir Gilbert Clayton, K.D.M.G., K.B.E., C.B., High Commie 8 ioner for Iraq, Baghdad,to the Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel C.C.J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.T.E., Political 'Resident intlie Persian Gulf, Bus&amp;ire. With reference to your demi-official letter Ho. 326-S. of the 8 th August, and in continuation of my reply No. S.O. 1689 of the 29th August, 1 find nov» that the Air Officer Commanding has not communicated direct to you in regard to the question of the Special Service Officer in Kuwait. He has, however, communicated his views to me on the question. The appointment of a Special Service Officer i appears to have been made early in 1928 (reference this office telegram No. 3l/S, dated the 17th February, 1928,, and the Political Resident’s reply Ho. 234, dated the 25tt of February, 1928). The appointment seems only to have been temporary, but in 1929 the Air Officer Commanding desired once more to send a Special Service Officer, and the natter was referred to the Political Resident, Bushire. His approval was received in telegram H®, 120 , dated the 4th of March, 1929, in which telegram, both the Political Agent Kuwait and the Shaikh were described as 'welcoming the idea'. Demi-official correspondence between Colonel Dent and Lieutenant—Colonel More, at the time when it was first proposed in 1928, to send a Special Service Officer, seems to have 4aid 4^wn the statue of the V appointment and the work which the Special Service Officer was required to do. The Air Officer Cornmdnding tells me that he f e el ofeels that the arguments for retaining the right to 1 1 *— m&gt; ■■ ■ ii i ■■■TSIw ' mmam aend a Special Service Officer to Kuwait are no less now than when the idea was first mooted. He points out that the relations between the Special Service Officer at Kuwait and the Political Tteoident mre analogous to those between a Special Service Officer and the local Administrative Inspector in Iraq. The Special Service Officer reports direct to the Air Officer Com manding and it is regarded as essential that his status in this respect should be maintained. At the same time copies of his reports, both written and telegraphic, are always given to the Administrative Inspector, who is frequently consulted and shown the draft before despatch in order that he nay comment upon its contents. 2 he Air Officer Commanding would wish that a-similar system, which has worked very smoothly and without any friction i in Iraq, should be observed in Kuwait, but he adds that he must ask to retain the power to send a Special Service Officer to Kuwait when he considers it necessary. With regard to Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson’s accusation that Captain Burton sends news which is 'often quite necessarily alarmist', the Air Officer Commanding observes that no such communications have been noted in his Headquarters, nor have any comments from Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson been received in regard to any specific message which may hawe been considered by him to be of an alarmist nature. It seems to me that the arrangement ought to perfectly run/smoothly in accordance with the procedure outlined by the Air Officer Commanding as it does in Iraq, where there is the additional complication of the Iraqi Mutasarrif to be ta^en in.to account. it should only be a matter ot a little 'give and take' and the maintenance of close and sympathetic personal relations. In any case, the question really seems to be one for you and theAir Officer Commanding and I do not see that 1 have really any business to interfere, except in an endeavour to assist towards an efficient system whicyv/ill satisfy both parties.Political 4gencs Kuwait• 28/9/29 Personal &amp; otticbly rivate. tty dear - Very many thanks for your personal letter of 2?nd Sept. I hope you will have no further cause to complain about my not repeating telegrams to do with B.S, or his Akhwan to High i ommlssloner, as 7 . T eli as mentioning that fact in my wires to you. I have rather cone to the conclusion that the High Comm's. office does not always pass or?, things I reoort to Air H.Q. It is difficult to think otherwise when one Goes some of the fatuous stuff published in Air Intelligence Reports. You will have notevi o doubt that my reports such as M Hassa and HeJd Situation' , are sent to you only. The usual 5 copies. I am rather afraid of sending anything direct to Baghdad-these days, lest l might offend. I know Iraq very well, and my experience is that any reporc jaggesting intrigue in high places, Is highly dangerous, l.any who receive such reports however ‘secret' they may be, talk about them to a degree unheard of, and as often as not pass them on to the persons one has adversely crltlzed. Speaking broadly the H.C's office is badly served In the intelligence lino, and will corrcinue to be so so long as Inspecting Officers are not directly reapons le to the High Commissioner. As it Is their br ad and butter lies in the hands of the Ministry of Interior. If Officers are wise they say nothing that might displease anywhere at all. As for Air Force Intelligence, S.S.O'o are good fellows all, but as they wander about and have areas of responsibility too big for them, they cannot be said to be in touch with thethe local Inhabitants, *hloh Is so necessary in order to 0 et to the bottom of things. Most of them are of course dependant on their Christian and. Jew Interpreters. Take for Instance youn.' lurton's methods and capabilities. He Is a very nice fellow socially, but he does not know a word of Arabic, he Is on the other hand excellent at. Turkish. They send hln to Kuwait to find out latest Nejd news. He has two iigllsh specJ.ln^ offend 1 3 of Baghdad I believe ic assist him. Barton sits in his house and receives well to do persons who are Interested parties, and these according as they are pro or anti b.S. pour their propaganda Into his ears, and 'iZS £2 through the medium of an Interpreter. Another Interpreter sits In the coffee shops and offers money for ne ■ l.ly Bedouin, even if he knows absolutely nothing win not hesitate to bring all kinds of gossip along 10 . loc j, - oliered. He then goes away and sends his pall alon The above is possibly a slightly exagerated picture, out Is what Is going on. I know that 3.3.0’s are frightfully keen individually, but When they stick to one place, have an active inter st in the locality they are In, and count for someone among the local Arabs&lt; as the Politicals under Cox's regime did ) they cannot expect to lean, anything beyond 'hakki al Nas” and 'what p co ol o w ant them to kr.o-' . Add to the above the fact that every Officer employee of the R.A.F. is I believe only in Iraq for 2 years, and Is aching to get back to the flesh pots of London, and you have a fair picture of the Intelligence system of the R.A.F. .Men of the ■hick, Leachman, Edmonds and Noel types are simply non existant In Iraq. Perhaps I am writing a bit sweeplngly but I-feel these days a little bitter to think that the R.A.F. authorities do not trust people like myself who are persons withv ith experience, live on the spot, and In a good position to ge accurate information. It seems to me that the Air Force (a) either do not trust me or (b) they do not like to admit that good information can come from the Political Dept. la^e that stupid reconnaissance easiness lately. As I read it the whole thing lay in the fact that 'Dickson'fi information was not quite to be trusted'*. A.0.C*s latest excuse that he had the vital port of Basrah to think of is all 'moonshine' 1 . What about poor old Kuwait situate a s* days march from the Akhwan and on their direct route to the vital Basrah? Forgive me if I have let myseif go above, but one lives alone here and it does one good to get things off ones cVst occaisonally. Anyway the feeling that I have your support is a very great comfort.# &lt; 'o PEiiaaiiAL aiu) gonFiDE?i?iAL. — D*0*no # ^55» Political Agency, Kuwait Dated the ^9th September 19^9• isy dear 7^ R e ference your demi-ofricial Uo.41b-s of 9 th September forwarding sir Gilbert Clayton’s IIo.sO 1746 of !?th September on subject of Special Service Officers, I am sending you copies of all demi-official and other correspondence I have in this office on the subject in order to give you a view at a glance of how the demand for an special service officer at Kuwait arose, as well as my predecessor's and Sir Lionel Haworth's ideas on the subject. I would also draw your attention to your office Uo.14 of 9th April 1926 to tho secretary of State for colonies as well as to your Uo.ob-S dated 2bth March 19'^9 and your ilo. 97-S of 2nd April 1929 paragraph 2, all three of v/hich bear on the subject policy of 'Iraq, towards Kuwait. 2. I do not thinh Colonel llore would have ever agreed to have an special service Officer in tho first place nad he not been a personal friend of Colonel Dents. Both had worked together in tho Intelligence Dopartmec.t during the wai &gt;. It seems to me that while Colonel Donts suggestions for the posting of an special Service Officer wore couched in reasonable language, Sir Lionel Haworth feared the 'the thin end of the wedge'; and what ho foared has rather cone to pass. For though the request was granted as a temporary measure in the first place and to meet an emergency, the Air officer Commanding would now appear to be asso/ming that The Hon'ble Lieutenant-colonel C.C.J.Barrett, C.S.I.,C.I.E#, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u 8 h i r 0 .$ * ■ Sr /z that he possesses the right to send an special Service Officer to Kuwait whenever he chooses; (sec paragraph IV of Sir Gilbert Clayton's letter). 4 . i personally have only had to deal with one Special service Officer, Captain Burton, and a nicer fellow I could not #ish to meet, but I always felt un comfortable when ho was in Kuwait, and was fcept wonder &gt; ing what he would report next. He, of course, visited every one from the Shai&amp;h downward and I fear often had his head filled by information given by interested parties. It is true captain Burton made a point of sending me copies of most of the telegrams he sent off, but tho mischief was done, and I was faced with having to follow up many of them with denials, or say nothing. 1 had not tho time to do the former, so unless a bad error occurred, I took up tne attitude that as a Politi cal Agent of some seniority my telegrams would receive prior credence. Still there was the uncomfortable feeling that his word would be sett against mine some times. it was also worrying to £now that captain Burton according to his own statement occasionally sent off cypher messages, copies of which he never showed me. All he aid was to mention that he had sent off a cypher about such and such a situation. 7. You will realize that it is difficult for me £0 drive my points home as well no I should like to, for theoretically it can bo shown that a tactful Special Service Officer can and should always be of assistance to a rather hard worked Political Agent. I prefer therefore that you form your opinion in the matter from the demi-official letters and telegrams on the subject which passed between colonel Hotq,xk Baghdad and Bushire.the Shaiich welcomed the idea of an Special service Officer, (vide telegram No,120 dated 4th March 1929 from Resident quoted by Sir Gilbert Clayton), j only know that one of the Special Service officers (Captain Howes) was not persona grata with Kis Excellency the Shaikh because of the way his (Howes) assistants swaggered about and made out in the coffee shops that the fate of Kuwait lay in the hollow of their hands. The Shaikh told me this,after I had been here a month, and said that he had to complain to More at the way one of Howes assistants had in spite of warnings nearly brought about a riot by persistently blowing smoke into the faces of certain Wahabi visitors sitting in a shop. 9. As for Captain Burton, the Shaikh certainly liked him but was inclined to fear him. He knew that hostile members of his own family the Subah, visited him, and was afraid they night try and create a hostile atnospnerc towards him in the eyes of the Special service Officer and so in Baghdad*s. 10. Lastly but by no means least the Shaikh has got the absurd idea into his head, that, from the days of G-lubb etc. Baghdad’s official mind has been poisoned against him. He rather fears Baghdad in consequence, and is inclined to look to India to sec that no harm comes to him. From his point of view it is unfortunate that the Royal Air Force are based in * Iraq as he feels they must share Baghdad’s prejudice at times. The idea, I know, is foolish and l»ve told him so. I fear I must disagree with Air Officer Commandingte comparison between the political Agent, Kuwait’s position to that of an Administrative Inspector in ’Iraq - (para graph 4 of sir Gilbert Clayton's letter). I have served in both capacities and for considerable periods myself.•«&gt; ' - ' . . 0s) Tiie political Agent servos Kis Majesty’s G-overnment of India. An Administrative Inspector servos the Arab Government of ’ Iraqt (with a shadowy sort of allegiance to the High CommissionerJ. The Administrative Inspector must therefore, 1 thinls, hold the political opinions of % the Arab Government ne serves. So any criticism made on an special service officer’s report would be biased by what ^he knew to bo his Government’s views. 12. It goes without sap 1 ing that I am as anxious as any-one to co-operate with the Itoyal Air Force and give thorn all possible facilities at all times and in every way, out in tnis matter of an special service Officer, I myself feel that in normal times I, as poli tical Agent, can and should be able to do all they want, certainly better than an officer strange to the place could. After all I have a good deal more experience than the average Special Service Officer. I have served in ’Iraq, as a political officer, I know the Euphrates and Southern Desert intimately, I have visited and lived with Bin Saud. I think I may bo trusted therefore to know the politics of Eastern Arabia, and the various situations that are likely to arise. Of course should abnormal or war conditions arise, then. I take a back soat and shall have nothing to say against the appointment of an Soecial Service Officer, though I note from correspondence attached that even when that did happen before* Colonel Dent wrote a tact ful note to Colonel More about the appointment of such an officer. 1 &gt;. as I am anxious to assist, I venture to suggest *1 the following wap out of the difficulty. (a) Let me do all Special Service Officers work in Kuwait for Air Officer Commanding. (b) In addition to repeating telegrams toi V Higli Coj^Liiiasioner lot me sond all ouch to Aviation, Baghdad, also. This will save delay* (c).Let Air Officer Commanding grant rno Be.12oo/- to be spent on secret Service work, (i have no Secret service Funds of my own). I do not agree with my predeces sor^ views about employing 'Agents'. (d) Let the Special service Officer Basrah visit me occasionally for purpose of dis cussing matters. I could normally put hin up for two or three days. {e) Occasional visits from Air orficer com manding, Chief Intelligence Officer, as well as other officers on his staff, will alweys be welcome. Difficulties are easier removed this way than by any amount £f letter writing. Also as the respon sible person here I shall feel that I am having a say in the matter.&amp; f y Telegram (p) prom - Aviation, Baghdad. To - Political, Kuwait. No. - Z Dated - 11th February 1926.

I think I get hold of most information of any value that comes into Kuwait in the ordinary course of events - though I dare say an/i all-time man might occasionally do so quicker. Still, I employ no secret service agents and in my Job I think it would be undesirable that II should, and for this reason alone it might be well worth while having a Special Service Officer in Kuwait.

I have really nothing whatever against the chap, and ^ dare say he is very efficient - he certainly talks Arabic well, but I someway feel that h^C he and I would pull together so well as night be desired. The situation is amazingly obscure these days, isn f t it? I simply cannot understand Ibn sa’ud^ action over Fahd bin jiluwi*s crowd. The Shaikh has been very jumpy since Dawish’s demand for Husabalah, and seoms to quite expect an attack. Anyway they are not likely to bother the town itself now, as the 'Emerald/ is here.

Dent, D.S.O., Air Headquarters, Baghdad.CONFIDENTIAL* D*O.No*77-S* The Residency, Bushire, loth February My dear More, Your telegram No.lOj ol* today. You are aware that my view of policy regarding Kuwait differs somewaht from that of 'Iraq. I separate J Kuwait as a permanent factor in our international policy from .'Iraq, which has one interest as a mandate but quite another if that mandate weakens or ceases. The posting of an 'Iraq Intelligence Officer at Kuwait has a tendency, of which 1 doubt the wisdom, of bringing an 'Iraq official as an immediate liaison bet ween Kuwait and 'Iraq resulting in opinions of which the hosident may have no knowledge and thus Milch he may be unable to contradict if he disagrees ?/ith them. It would bring an »iraq officer into immediate touch with the Shaikh of rniwait and must weaken the position of the political Agent and produce friction since the tendency of the Shaikh will bo to turn to 'Iraq for assistance. This would gradually link Kuwait with »Iraq and might result in a very close alliance, even a tendency to absorption in subordinate alliance as opposed to ibn Saud. As protecting power we should have to combat any such tendency as opposed to our interests. I can see no compensatory advantage to be gained, would you let me know what tne intelligence Officer can do that you cannot, and your studied opinion in view of what ± have said. I am quite ready, if you can put up a case, to suggest an Intelligence Officer from India. Yours sincerely, Sd/- L Haworth.TeXogram (p). Prom — Political, Kuwait* To - RecicLeiit, Busniro. Ho. - 149. Dated — Feoruary 19^^ Demi-Ofl*icial. Your D.O. letter No.77 s of 18th February. I auite understand wliy you tnink it undesirable to have an intelligence Officer from ’Iraq, posted to Kuwait, and but for tlic fact that it was only proposed as a temporary measure I would be as much opposed to it as you are. Ho doubt one reason why the proposal seemed to me so attract ive was that when it was made 1 was snowed under with more worh than I could satisfactorily cope with, and I know that he would relieve me of some of it. There is not the slightest need Acre an Intellegence Officer hero in normal times, and i think that even now the only things which he could do which j do not are (a) as %k would be he all-time work he could go round himself more, ana so get the information quicker, (b) He could employ secret service agontsy^I think, however, that at a time like the present he would be worth having for (b) alone. I have no funds for secret service work and j do not think that it would be desirable for me personally to employ spies in any case, yot it is an undeniable fact that they are useful and Kuwait would bo the best recruiting ground for them for the type of tribal work which is required. I do not advocate your applying for a nan from India as it would take too long, and besides he would be absolutely use less unless he knew Arabic really well. If you think that the advantages are outweighed by the dis advantages I venture to suggest the possibility of a com promise by your borrowing the services of an Arabic speaking British officer from Air Headsfuarters, »lraq, to act Tempor- arily as my assistant, on the 'understanding that I would only employ him on Intelligence work, for which they wouldwould provide the funda, and he would make his reports to me and not correspond directly at all. They mi£ht agree to this as the head of the ^ntellegence in Baghdad and I worked together at intellegence all through the war. The next day or two will show whether there is any need for anything of the sort or not.Telegram (P). From - political, Kuwait. To - lies i dent, Busliire. no. - iyf. Dated - 25 th February 19^9.

Lt.-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, C.I.E., H.b.M.G. Political Agent, K u w a it. Dear i was told two or three days ago to write to you. and I should have written long ago in answer to the long letter you wrote me shortly after my visit to Kuwait. We have been so busy lately trying to sort out the masses of messages that we have got about the situation that I have not had a moment. Cne cannot yet tell whether the need for it has now passed or whether that need will shortly be still greater, but we are anxious to have, if possible, a list of the names of the principal leaders of the Pidawiyah and Rashaidah for record and distribution in case operations take place in Kuwait territory and you yourself are not with, let us say, the armoured cars. if you could give us a list showing just the names with approximate following in tents, horses and rifles, it would be extremely valuable.

(Jfcj'fffa t I feel that it would be a goou thing if we &lt;C\ could arrange for closer liaison between our Intelligence organization, so far as it concerns the Basra and Southern Desert area, and yourself. Although, of course, we see your fortnightly reports which are for warded by the Residency for perusal, I aai sure that there are many other points of detailed Intelligence which you acquire from time to time and which we should find of great use. I am particularly thinking of the ’Iraqi nomad and semi-nomad tribes which cross over every year to Kuwait territory for grazing, and I should like to feel that we have the benefit of your advice in any incidents which might affect or be of interest to both countries. you would see any objection to periodic liaison visits being made to you by cur Special service Officer at Basra I believe that he has in the past paid occasional visits, but I do not know whether or not you hav^ any views on the subject. I should like these visits to be rather more frequent and that the inter-change of information should be quite free . 01 course, I am not a^kiiq, that you sh ould permit tne to O o into xoinvait territory andhrbss-exami nj inhabitants. All that he would do wouTu be to c ome into your office and inter-change information with you,and you alone. his reports, not only those which directly affect Kuwait, but also those dealing with tribal movements or other matters in 'Iraqi territory in the vicinity of Kuwait. 4. I believe you are already acquainted with Flight Lieutenant A. J. Howes who is our Special Service Officer at Basra, and if you agree generally with my suggestion, I will instruct him to ma^e the detailed arrangements in direct communication with you. With this object in view, I am wondering whether He could, if you so desire, send you copies of Lieut .-Colonel H. R. 1.

I have therefore taken the liberty of sending on your letter to him and have suggested that he communicate his views direct to you to save time* I feel sure he will consider the matter sympathetically. to extend to you an invitation on behalf of my wife and myself to fly down and spend a few days with us say early in March.

The Hon*ble Lieutenant-Colonel H.V.Biscoe, Political Resident in the ^orsian Gulf lushire./*N - 2 - Had it n«t been f»r the stouft support you &amp;are me and for which I shall be ever grateful, I believe I should have been w euted w from Kuwait. Courtney s letter on the other hond, is so very nicely put, that I feel it will be most difficult to refuse his request. If we can only insure that the S.S.O. who comes here will do so each time with my previous permission, and s ^ r ictly abide by the rules laid down by Qourtney in his letter, and abere all will confine his talks t» me and me alone, I do not rery well see how we can avoid meeting Courtney half way and agreeing to his suggestion. 1 w»uld even welcome Courtney himself coming down occasionally and paying me a vltlt as such could only result in good. • 5# Actually there is nothing in the inferaiation line 11 which I could not provide for Baghdad Just as well as better, than any number of S.S.O.j and I could always supply any sEo^^al Information required, If I wore only asked for It. ■ut Air Headquarters seem to prefer their own •ffloors* reports to ours. *• Oa® U»ing more, it is very desirable In my opinion to get into the minds of Air Headquarters that Political A gents In the gulf are not the same as Inspecting Officers and Advisers as exist in Iraq, but have a totally different status and responsibility. Hitherto this does not seem to have ' been understood in the least.A As Courtney has new raised a matter of policy and as I do not wish to do anything in this matter without y«ir full knowledge and concurrence, I shall be grateful if you would decide what you would consider the best course for me to adopt, and would prefer if you do not mind my suggesting it, that you reply direct to Courtney, as I feel I am en'tender' ground. 8 * 1 rather suspect that Howes has some thing to do with Courtney's letter, boeause three weeks ago he asked if he oould come down and stay with me, and I replied privately that ’I that I should be delimited te put him up f«r a week end or so, provided he oame unofficially . He has now wired to say he will come on the 27th to 29th February, • • Meanwhile I propose replying to Courtney with a letter, saying that I have referred the matter to you, as I did not feel quite at liberty to reply without consulting you first, 10, Please forgive mmx such a lengthy screed. # \ V l*&gt; Reference No: D .0 .1/17/3^.

My deer Fowle British Forces in Ir^q, Hinaidi, Iraq. 24th February 1936. Pleaee refer to your demi-official letter Sio.96-S of 1936, in which you give your views on the appointment of an Air Liaison Officer, Persian Gulf, with headquarters at Bahrain. Most certainly this officer’s activities will be confined to the Arabian side and there is no intention what soever that he should concern himself with Iran. I fully appreciate your points about existing informa tion on the Arabian Coast of the Gulf, but perhaps you do not know that we have started to collate all the information available, f om which we hope eventually to produce a handbook covering all our requirements. It will be some time before we can get this material into shape for publication, and the work of bringing the information up to date, checking it over with Political Agents, and arranging it in &amp; suitable form, will be one of the reeponeibil itiee of the Air Liaison Cfficer. In this connection, we have found Lorrimer'e Gazetteer most useful, but O’Connor’s military report of 1933 has disappointingly proved to be of no great value. From the subsequent paragraphs of your letter I get the impression that you feel that this extension of the R.A.F. Intelligence system is a super imposition upon the organisation which is at present maintained by the political Agents in the Gulf. Buoh an idea is far removed from our in tentions and 1 regard this appointment as a supplement to your existing arrangements, which, it is hoped, will not only meet service needs, but will also be of material aosietance to / Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fewle»CBK. 9 Hon. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bus hire.to your Political officers* In those countries ehers responsibility for security has been allotted to the Royal Air Force, our experience has been that the extra facilities afforded by our presence have been fully utilised by the political authorities, and that a liaison, closer than is possible where other services are concerned, is maintained with the administration, especially amongst those whose duties take them to outlying districts, I a*, therefore, optimistic that cordial relations will exist between your officers ana the proposed Air Liaison officer. You will, 1 think, agree that developments on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf have occurred with unexpect ed rapidity during the past year or two, acu there are sound grounds for supposing that commercial undertakings, a notice- able increase m air traffic, and the like, will give added importance to this area in the near future, yith ouch developments in prospect, and bearing in mind the security responsibilities which have develved on the Air Force, I do not think that the work of the Air Liaison officer will be a sinecure. I am in full agreement with the conditions limiting the activities of the Air Liaison officer, which you propose in the last paragraph of your letter, and 1 am naturally prepared to accept the information provided on political matters by those officials who are In oon&amp;tant touch with local affairs, Aihen the appointment of an Air Liaison Officer is finally approved, I intend to draft detailed instructions defining his duties, and I will refer this paper to you for any modi fications and suggestions you may care to put forward.
