Mr. tilshaw says that the application of the Scheme to the two first-named places would involve the Company in a loss of over £2,000 per annum. He observes that the main tenance and operation of the strategic cables in the Persian Gulf involves great expense and this factor makes it difficult to agree to any proposal that would reduce the Company’s revenue from Persian Gulf traffic.

A Bill will shortly be laid before Parliament to authorize certain changes in the arrangements between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and Cable and Wireless Limited, the Company which was charged with the conduct of the main overseas telegraph services of the British Common wealth as the outcome of the Report of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 1928 (Command Paper No. 3163 of 1928). The relations between the British Commonwealth Gov ernments concerned and the Companies in the cable and wireless merger are defined in the Agreements made in pursuance of that Report (Command Paper No. 3338 of 1929). 2. The policy then agreed upon was to provide for co-opera tion among the Governments for the maintenance and develop ment under British control of the overseas cable and wireless telegraph system of the Empire operating through private enterprise in the United Kingdom, but under quasi-public utility conditions. This policy has in recent years become endangered, partly because the operating Company has been unable to earn the revenue which it was expected to receive under the new con ditions, and has thus been unable to reduce the telegraph tariffs to the extent which had been hoped (although very substantial reductions of tariffs were made with corresponding benefit to the public) and partly owing to the threat of foreign competition on Empire routes, by the introduction of new direct wireless services competing with the Company’s system. In view of these difficulties, the Governments concerned, with the advice and assistance of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, which was appointed by the Govern ments as part of the 1928 scheme, have for some time past been engaged in reviewing the position. As a result of this review, and of subsequent negotiations with Cable and Wireless Limited, certain proposals have emerged, to which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, with the general assent of the Governments of the Dominions and of India, are prepared, subject to the authority of Parliament, to give their approval. 3. The proposed settlement calls for financial sacrifices by the United Kingdom and most of the overseas Governments, and by the Company and its associates, but these, it is believed, will be offset by the benefits which will accrue to all parties, and particularly to the public users of the Company’s system. 4. The main purport of the proposed settlement is threefold. First, it provides for an immediate and substantial reduction of Empire telegraph rates, and makes it more easily possible for further reductions to be effected in future if the expected stimulus to traffic should make this practicable. Secondly, it relieves the present strain on the finances of Cable and4 Wireless Limited by providing for the exchange of the prior charge on the Company's revenues which His Majesty's Govern ment now hold (in the form of a rental for the Beam Wireless Stations which were leased to the Company by the Post Office in 1928), for an interest in the equity of the undertaking. And thirdly, the Governments concerned are asked, in confirmation of the policy agreed in 1928, to accord their fullest support and co-operation to the Company’s system, thus enabling the Company to provide with greater confidence for the future development of its services. 5. The object of this memorandum is to describe shortly the more important proposals, and particularly those of a financial nature which affect the United Kingdom Exchequer. 6. Under the arrangements which were approved in 1928, the four Beam Wireless Stations in the United Kingdom which were owned by His Majesty's Postmaster General and had previously been operated by him, were leased to the Company, (together with the free use of certain telegraphic circuits required for the working of the stations) for a period of 25 years, terminating in 1953, in return for a rental, known as the ' Beam Rental ”, payable to the Post Office during the same period and consisting of— [а) a fixed annual payment of £250,000; and (б) 12 per cent, of the surplus profits, if any, earned by the Company in any year above a certain level. The fixed annual rental of £250,000 has been duly paid by the Company throughout, but the profits earned have never been sufficient to provide any additional payment under (b). Financial Arrangements. 7. —(i) It is now proposed that Cable and Wireless Limited shall be granted the freehold of the Beam Wireless Stations aforesaid, and that the Beam rental shall be cancelled, with effect from the 1st March, 1938. (ii) In consideration of this concession, it is proposed that there shall be transferred to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, without payment, 2,600,000 £1 shares in Cable and Wireless Limited, to be found from the existing issued capital of the Company (£30,000,000) by agreement between the parties concerned. (iii) As part of the general settlement, it is proposed that His Majesty’s Postmaster General shall waive a claim for a small payment from Cable and Wireless Limited in respect of the right conceded to the Company to operate a wireless tele graph service with Kenya in place of that previously operated by the General Post Office. (iv) It is proposed that the Anglo-Continental telegraph services operated by the General Post Office and Cable and5 Wireless Limited respectively, shall be co-ordinated under a Joint Purse working arrangement to be concluded between the parties. Extension of the Company’s Licence in the United Kingdom. (v) It is proposed that the licence granted to the Company by the Postmaster General in 1929 which is due to expire in ■ O53 shall be extended for 25 years from the 1st January, 1938, u.nd shall remain in force after the expiry of the extended period unless definite action is taken to the contrary; the intention being to give the Company, so far as practicable, security of tenure in the operation of its services. The present free provi sion of telegraphic circuits for the Beam Wireless Stations will also be continued throughout the period of the 1929 licence as now to be extended. Reduction of Standard Revenue. (vi) Under the arrangements which were approved in 1928, it was provided that if the net revenue of the Company should exceed a certain limit, known as the Standard Revenue, one half of any surplus thereover should be allocated to the reduc tion of rates or the development of the services under schemes approved by the Imperial Communications Advisory Com mittee. The Standard Revenue was fixed in 1928 at ,£1,865,000 per annum, being approximately 6 per cent, on the capital of the Company. Under the arrangements now contemplated, the Standard Revenue will, in effect, be written down to a figure of 4 per cent, on the capital, or £1,200,000 per annum. Strategic Cables. (vii) In arriving at the general settlement, account has been taken of the obligations of the Company in regard to the main tenance of cables which may be required for strategic purposes. Reduction of Overseas Telegraph Rates. (viii) As a condition of these proposals the Company have also agreed to introduce a far-reaching scheme for the reduc tion of overseas telegraph rates. This scheme is the outcome of discussions between representatives of the Governments and of the Company. Its main provision is that, subject to agree ment being reached with the administrations and other parties concerned, rates for full rate traffic between all the different parts of the Empire are to be reduced so far as practicable to a uniform basis. This uniform basis is to be is. 3d. a word (with a code rate of lod. a word), but existing rates which are already below this level will not be increased. There will be consequential reductions in certain rates for the cheaper classes of traffic which are proportional to the full rate. It is the6 (47084— 1) Wt. 1867—1938 1250 4/38 P. St. G. 390 intention to put the new rates into effect on the 25th April, 1938. To facilitate the reductions in the public rates the Govern ments are asked, subject to special arrangements in certain cases, to make reductions in the terminal and transit rates at present charged by them where such rates exceed i|d. sterling per word on the traffic affected. The benefit of the reductions on tele graphic rates to the public, at home and overseas, is estimated to amount to nearly £500,000 per annum. In addition to the specif financial arrangement made by the United Kingdom Govern ment, without which the reductions would not have been possi ble, the new tariffs involve concessions of varying amounts on the part of overseas Governments. But the main burden will fall on the Company itself and its associates. 8. The Directors have agreed to these proposals. 9. The figure of 2,600,000 for the number of shares in the Company to be issued to the United Kingdom Government is a figure negotiated as part of the general settlement, based upon the discounted present value of the outstanding payments of the Beam rental until the end of the present lease in 1953 * 10. The surrender of the fixed Beam rental of £250,000 pay able annually under the existing lease until IQ53» i n return for such income as may be received from the dividends on the Government’s new holding of 2,600,000 shares in the Com pany, represents a substantial sacrifice on the part of His Majesty's Government in terms of revenue. The Beam rental has hitherto been paid to the Post Office; but, in view of the wider public issues involved in the proposed financial arrangements with the Company, it has been agreed between the Treasury and the Post Office that the net consequential loss in excess of £100,000 per annum shall be borne by the Exchequer. This will require a modification of the arrange ments governing the Fixed Exchequer Contribution payable by the Post Office under Part IV of the Finance Act, 1933, as extended by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1937 » f° r which statutory authority will be sought in due course. 11. His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that as a con tribution to the general settlement the cost of the proposed concession is outweighed by the great importance, alike on political, commercial and strategic grounds, of maintaining intact the system of Imperial communications carried on by the Company.25th April, the Govern- srtain cases, s at present rg per word )ns on tele- estimated to o the specif. &gt;m Govern been possi- amounts on burden will lares in the vernment is based upon nents of the 50,000 pay- ,, in return ends on the 1 the Com part of His 3 eam rental it, in view ed financial :ed between msequential )rne by the he arrange- on payable ct, 1933,. as , for which t as a con- le proposed e, alike on maintaining :ried on by</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002d2_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/4144</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002d2</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/4144</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 35/36 'Persian Gulf: introduction of uniform cable and wireless rates within the Empire; application of scheme to stations in the Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-11-29T22:10:48</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (21 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 23; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns arrangements between the British Government and Cable and Wireless Limited for a reduction in cable and wireless rates within the British Empire, and the application of this scheme to stations in the Persian Gulf.The file contains correspondence between Cable and Wireless Limited, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Bahrain, and Imperial Communications Advisory Committee.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002d2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
