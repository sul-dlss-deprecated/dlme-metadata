These were of interest to the British Government because of the potential threat they presented to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s [APOC] monopoly on oil exploration and extraction in Persia. The correspondence covers: the agreement of an oil concession between the Persian Government and the Georgian national, Akaki Khoshtaria, covering north Persia, and the concession’s subsequent abrogation; the purchase of Khoshtaria’s interests by APOC; reports of American interests in oil exploration in Persia, including the Standard Oil Company; a concession for a coal mine and light railway running around Tehran, being sought by a private banker named Tomaniantz. The volume’s principal correspondents are: the British Minister at Tehran, Charles Murray Marling; the Foreign Office; the Director of APOC, Charles Greenway.The volume contains several items written in French.The volume includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Persia</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000233#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000233#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000233#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000233#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
