The first (dated 30th June) shows that the visit of the Iraqi Prime Minister on his way to Saudi Arabia (cf. P.Z.3900/39 flagged) should have the desired effect of improving relations between Iraq and Kuwait and did not lead to any undesirable political discussions. The second (dated 1st July) shows that the Sheikh of Kuwait has decided to take firm action against political conspirators and malcontents. Yusuf Marzook, who was one of the ring leaders/' t . . v. . leaders in the shooting affray on the 10th March (cf.P.Z.2121/39 flagged) has been imprisoned. For his antecedents vide the Agent’s account of this affair, especially paragraph 8.

We do our best to keep a close watch on the activities of the Muthanna Club, The Prime Minister told Holt a few days ago that he was taking steps to curb the Club's activities. He had caused the Club's responsible officials to be warned that under the law it had permission to exist only as a cultural association and had no authority to engage in political activities. I hope this warning may do good. It certainly seems to have prevented the Club from organising public demonstrations against the White Paper on Palestine. Yours ever. (Sgd) BASIL NEWTON.

Shortly after the Ambassador’s departure, 1 received from the Political kesident in the Persian Gulf, news of the several serious incursions of Xra^i police into fcoweiti territory which toox place in karefc* and of the attachment of some of the ihaikh of Kuweit’s properties in lrm%» i iff/ reported in my telegram J5lo. 91 of ! arch 2- th the imrtiediate representations which I made concerning these events to ring Ohaal and hia principal ministers, b* during the next wee* I repeatedly discussed the whole question with the Prime Minister, Mho appeared to be at a lose to *now how to deal with the situation. !e told me privately that he found King ®hasi unmanageable where Koweit was concerned. It seemed that a few discontented young Ko^itia had gained access to His Majesty end had cajoled him into 1 taking up their cause*. ^ing Ghasi, without reference to his Ministers, had thereupon organised hia broadcast propaganda and had given private encouragement to the press to write up the alleged grievances of the 1 owe!tie and to elaborate articles advocating the absorption of Koweit by Iraq* The t*rirse Minister told m that when he returned at the end of February he had been astonished to find that the Government appeared to be allowing this aati-? ! oweit campaign to develop without remonstrating in any way with is Vajesty. I have reported in another connexion the difficulty the Prime Minister experiences in controlling the Minister of the Interior: I should add that he is not satisfied either with gashid All, Hale of the Royal Piwan, for whom another poet- 3 - will probably be fomnd if and wnen i.iuri-al-3«id feela him&amp;elf strong enough to bring this about. 6. lie had at onoe set about tryi/% to put matters right, but had found it an exceedingly difficult tasc. ^hea he went to the Palace in the morning the King woul* nrornlse to be good, but in the evening His Majesty was apt all too easily to be oersuaded by the young saan, including his wireless operators# with whore he associated at that tirae of day (the Prime Sinister strongly susoeeted that aome of these were in the pay of the German Leg^tlon^ to defy the advise of his Ministers and to believe thnt he was serving the best interests of the ^rabs and the eauae of Arab unity by broadcasting extremist nonsense about gowelt, Palestine, Syria and, on occasions, Transjordan. Almost daily, and often in the middle of the night, King Ohsxi was sending for or telephoning to the Prime Minister and pressing him to take steps to deal with V owe it. hat Us Majesty wished ahould be done was never clear but, since the suppression of the abortive rising against the ;&gt;abfth family# he bad been flattered by constant pressure which was bein^ put upon him to help the Kowe!tie Who had been banished or wao h&gt;d fled into Iraq. The problem was in fact nainly how to save the King’s face. The Prime Minister therefore thought ti t it would have a good effect on King Ghasi if it could be arranged that the proposed messenger should be received by the Thaikh without delay. 7. I used all the obvious arguments. I said that it seemed to be quite uncertain what message the meseenger was to take. The first Idea had been that it would conaiat of apologies for the Palace broadcasts. Later it had been suggested that the messenger would advise the Ruler on the administration of hi. 3tatc, and eren offer t ie Servians of IraqiyIraqi police to fcccp or&lt;S®r for him* Sow it aee ^ that the riea«age would also s^raoe an appeal from fis Majesty for clemency for those who we ire responsible for ^ie recent attempt to organise a revolt in Koweit against the ruling f ;mily. I enlarged on the absurdity of sending an apology to the Shaikh while the King's wireless was still abusing him# his territory was being violated by Iraqi police and his properties were sequestrated in the most offensive and inexcusable rr&amp;tnner by the locsl representatives of the Iraqi Government in Basra* The second idea# 1 said# paid no heed I to the special trusty relations of Xoweit with Great Britain# I end was moreover quite gratuitously impertinent. The social conditions of \oweit were in f&amp;et a good deal better than tae average obtaining in Iraq, and it woula be wiser for to put her own affairs in order than to prosame to give advice | to 'oweit* As regards clemency, X had no doubt tr t the exiles could easily males their own peace with their jlar if fcftey asfce1 for pardon decently and gave promises for their future good behaviour* huri-al -i’eid admitted the force of •11 these arguments# but pressed me persistently to do son*thing to help him to eala His Majesty# whose unreasoned and unreasonable issportunities about ICoweit were, the Prime Minister said# leaving him no peace to look after the many other pressing problems with which he ought to be dealing* 8. 1 aaw King Ghasl again (and, as it transpired# for the last ti&amp;e&gt; on April 3rd. The Jrime Minister was present, together with the Iksls of the 8oyal Mwaa# Maehid Ali* The dleodesions were inconclusive and often irrelevant* King «haxi, having made rnueh of the importance he attached to an early pardon being granted to Kovelti malcontents who had been arrested# the backward state of oweit, etc., etc., sought to ascribe all these evils to sfauggling. T is 'ejesty w«s stronglyi strongly supported in this by His 1 ’rirw S inister who f incidentally, did most of the talking on this well-^om theme. Protesting vainly against the irrelevancy of txia subject, I took my stand on the hope of the early eonolusion of the ^iaudi- Koweit agreeraent for the control of trade between the two | countries and the kuler of Kuweit’a undertaking to stop all smuggling into Iraq so soon as this agreement was brought into force. 1 shall report the count#r-ar^vu^onts which were then adduced and discuss the wider asp&amp;cta or the suu^lin* ^ueetion in a separate despatch, which 1 hope to be able aeon to «ddrcso to Your Lordship. From s'TOggllng I manage I witn difficulty to bring the discussions back to propaganda against 'oweit, to the police incursions and the attachment of the Shaikh of Koweit*s properties. The Ministers airily assured m that the properties had been restored to the dhaikh, that the police incidents would be investigated and that therefore there was no need to discuss these matters, in feet, the sooner they were forgotten, the better. They brushed aside my observation that the impression wlrich theae incidents had rmd&amp; coui: not easily be dispelled maintaining that any annoyance which had been caused to the ohaikh would be quickly erased by King ahasi’a gracious message and tnc onarm and tact with «hioh it would be delivered. X refused to be a fwrty to t^iis easy optimism and insisted that satisfactory replies must first be given to my protests about Vie attachment of tne juaikh*s properties and the misconduct of the police, and I argued that time *uaet oe allowed to naal wounded pride before the right atmoeputre c uld be OT^eated for the success of the messenger’s visit. The meeting ended after an hour or longer with the exhaustion of all concerned, and with nothing more achieved than mutual undertakings to think the whole matter over and see if some* thing eould be done. (Nevertheless, I did get the r Ung to admit56 mt $ 4m atoit the inconslatenc/ of orofc* ting to me t&gt;,&gt; diiyiigiit the personal regard in which he held the Shaiich* and in the eweniag insulting Us Highness from the Koyal Broa&amp;sastlng station). The Prime Hinister had already told me privately that he had discovered that the attachment of the Shaiich of '‘'‘oweit’s properties in Fao had been due to direct orders sent by * ing Ghazi to the ^utsaarrif , but he was positive in his sssuranoes that he had taken the necessary steps to have the utaaarrlf* a action cancelled and the revenue iemand withdrawn. 9. The fatal accident on the night of April 3rd* which cost ring cmassi his life, has relieved the situation a good deal iThe *asr al £uhur wireless broadcasting station has been handed ovsr to the Oevemment, and Soyal patronage of rebellious eler:^ente in Xoweit has ceased. Palace pressure on the Tins Minister to arrange for the visit to ftoweit of a special messenger h&amp;s also disappeared though I foresee that the : rime Linistcr may raise t/ic rnattex- again oefore long. If he does so I shall speak to him on the lines of your telegram Ho* 9'[ of March &lt;50th. 10. Hevertheless, even now the position is far from satisfactory. national1*1 agitation for the union of roweit with Iraq has, with the late viag* o encouragement, been taken up eagerly by the Pan-\rab clubs and may be renewed again at &gt;,w ' . ■ any moment under the leadership of the fanatical Shaukat family. There has been a serious hitch in the fulfilment of the Prime lliniater's prosaiee that the attachment of the Sheikh’s properties would be cancelled (see my telegram Ho. 13T of April 18th) and the reply which has been made to my protest about police incursions into -toweit is sal together inade paste. This reply eonaisted of a statement that the enquiries made by the competent authorities showed that toe alleged Incursions into Koweiti territory had not in fact ta^an plaice, and wenton to raise irrelevant objection* to the movements of the Political Agent in Koweit. 'hen I visited the Prime Minister on April 11th* I informed His Excellency that I could not transmit such a reply to my Government and I have since written him an official letter urging that an Independent and authoritative enquiry should be carried out at once &amp;nd that a full report of the result should be eoataunioeted to me. Privately* the iri^e Minister promised roe to do his best to persuade the Ministry of the Interior to nominate a special official for this task and to associate with him the British inspecting officer of Police at tears* He admitted* however, that it would not be easy for him to move the Minister of the Interior to do this* it was ji ihaukot* he said* who on account of his dislike of the Shaikh* had obstructed the prompt transmission of an order to the Putasarrlf of Basra (a politician who had been appointed by the Minister of the Interior in Huri al Said's absence in London, with the express object of creating trouble with HoweIt) to cancel the attachment of the Shaikh 9 * properties, and the * J rim© Minister foresaw that, for ainilar reasons* the Minister of the Interior would find s variety of excuses for not taking strong action properly to investigate the alleged misconduct of the Basra police* 11* The Prims Biinieter of course again raised the ^osstioa of smuggling* a not unfounded’ ^risvanco which always seems to crop up whenever a protest la made concerning some action touching the shaikh 1 * interests* * vicious circle seems* in fact* to have been established* /hen a protest is made to the Iraqi Govern.sent about police incur sions into Xowelt they counter with oomwlaints about smuggling, and whenevsr an attempt is mads to leal with smuggling the Shaikh protests that no satisfaction has everm $ m been given to hi* nuraerou* aomplalnts of incur 3 1 by ra&lt;ji poli^ce into hi* territory. 12.

(bj The -utaesarif of Basrah, in a conversation which he had with the shaikh's son, stated that the attachment of the estate was so far an attachment more 'in name' than in fact, and that if the Bhaikh would deal with him instead of with the British he could arrange for a Bill to be passed in the new Iraqi Parliament with the object of remitting payment of the taxes due from the Bhaikh. The Mutassarif went on to warn the Shaikh through his son of the unwisdom of trying to settle his affairs through the British. 3. (1) -ith regard to (a).

It is deplorable that in spite of friendly sentiments expressed by idng Cfhazi and his Ministers propaganda against Koweit and violations oi Koweit territory continue. Latest incursions of Iraqi police are indefensible and it would in any case be impossible for His Majesty's Government to advise Sheikh to receive King Ghazi's messenger until adequate amends for these incursions had been received. 3. It now appears, moreover, that the messenger would be sent on an official mission and that it is even contemplated that he should give advice to the Sheikh about administration of his country. 4. The Sheikh is precluded by his treaty engagements from receiving the agent or representative of a foreign power except with the consent of His Majesty’s Government and it must be clear to the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government could in no circumstances permit any interference in the internal affairs of Koweit. If there- fore the Iraqi Government wish to make to the Sheikh any communication other than a message of mere courtesy this should be made in the normal way through you. 5. Provided you see no objection, you should speak to the Minister for foreign Affairs m the sense of the foregoing paragraphs, r 6u Y ? u should also urge him strongly to agree to Iraqi cooperation in the early demarcation of the frontier in order that the risk of •incidents may be lessened (see Political Resident’s telegram No.150 L [of March 22nd]), (R ends). 1.

C/88 of 10th March, 1939, the events on the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, vhich followed each other quickly, or sometimes were simultaneous, so that even Shaikh Ahmad, when he came to give me the details on the afternoon of the 10th, was not entirely clear about all of them. 2. Vhat stands out is,Iraqi propaganda^ working on L ie minds of merchants and town youths of necessarily li dteu vision (many of whom have been in increasingly poor circum stances, owing to the Saudi Blockade and the drop in the pearl market) is mainly responsible for what occurred. 3. As I reported in my telegram No. c/82 of the 7th March, the Shaikh had dissolved the second Kuwait Council, which had never functioned as such, on the 7th March. Because the Arabic broadcasts from London had had a good effect, the Shaikh seemed to have chosen his moment well, but the outgoing Council had to hand over to the Shaikh I&gt;7 6./ -2 some papers in their possession and asked for time. These papers, such things as the old Kuwait Constitution, written out hy themselves, and since superseded, hotli in fact and on paper, a contract for removal of gravel, and another for sand, with some others, they evidently set great store hy, had been sent to Basra for safe keeping. 4. The Shaikh told me all about this, arid showed me the list of his new Council, a partly elected and partly nominated one, about 3 P. ir on the 9th at his country house some miles away from the city. *hile he was doing so, one of his cousins, the black Shaikh, 1? Ail AD bin 3 ALIM A3 3UBAH, a brave and intelligent young man, arrived to report a set back. The State Accountant, a member of the Council, known to his friends as “the Minister of Finance', refused to hand over his account books and was receiving support, arkl the Council had asked for a few more hours before handing over the papers. None of this seemed very serious so far an! while I was there the Shaikh sent back sensible, if, to my mind, slightly confusedly given, orders. 5. Later in the day, however, a certain MOHAMMAD 3IN MONAIS, a Kuwaiti, a small grain merchant living in Iraq, formerly a water carrier here, who arrived on the 7th and who some people are convinced was on a mission from the Iraq. Government, so authoritatively did he speak, had encouraged young men to distribute leaflets proclaiming the Subah ruling family deposed from power and calling upon the people to resist them. Tie addressed a gathering of some of the fallen Council in stirring language on the same lines, and they foolishly applauded him and declared that they would support him; ne s of which quickly circulated, and caused excitement which lasted until late at night, incidentally being enough to make the new Council hesitate to take office.i h fit , KUf £rr&amp;t&gt;C'• ^ -3- 6 9 After dark, Colonel Dickson, Chief Local representative of the Kuwait Oil Company, and. ex: Political Agent, Kuwait, an avowed and staunch opponent of Councils, had an interview with the Ohaikh, which in itself gave rise to some further specula tion and rumour. 7. The brilliantly sunny morning of the 10th, however, seemed no day for politics, and I was hardly surprised when the negro Shaikh, FARAD, came to tell me that things now appeared to he going Letter. The old Council had in the end promised to hand over their precious papers on the evening of the 10th, their temporary Council chamber had heen closed, and they would make no more trouble. The ^aikh, he thought, had now decided not to have an elected Council at all. This last, no doubt, was known to others. 8. Meanwhile the Director of Security had rightly proceeded with the arrest of M0H01CIAD Lin MTJHAI3, which he resisted, bein£ severely cuffed for his trouble. Then, on the way to the prison, this little procession was met by the notorious hot-head and smuggler YUSUF IlAiiSOOK, accompanied by MUHAMMAD AL QJTAMI, a follower of the former Council. There was an altercation. MUHAMMAD shot at and missed the Police. YUSUF put his hand to his revolver and the police fired, mortally wounding al ^ITAMI, hitting Yusuf in the foot, and a nearby shopkeeper in the posterior. 9. There was of course once more confusion all over the town. The Bedouins rushed to arms shouting *To the Suoan'*, 'They are attacking the Subah', and Shaikh Ahmad arrived only just in time to prevent an outbreak of firing and the murder of I Moiiommad al Uunais. (In doing so he was hit on the hack of the head hy a rifle hutt). Promise of an immediate trial of Munais » staved off the fury of the tribal followers for the moment, but it is hardly surprising that the Subah judges, maddened by weeks with the screams-4- 2721 | I m I Q?)Q I men in their ears, and the generci^^iiddu^iL^s dangerous as it was, shortly announced him a convicted traitor and the sentence as death. The man was publicly shot, and s uosequentl/— hung until evening, in the main square. 10. The effect of the execution was to send most people to ground immediately. As the gates were held no one could get away from Kuwait, and after some rather protracted hide and seek, all the •wanted* members of the late Council, five in number were found and placed under arrest. 11. The day ended with Shaikh Ahmad leadin 0 d .r lance in the main square and with any hope of an elected council peacefully aiding him in the administration, gone for a long time, if not for good. 12. His Highness spoke to me on the morning of the lith .ma of his intention to fora an advisory council from his family am the notables. I shall keep him up to doing this and doing it soon, and I have no doubt that the SUBAH family also will keep him up to it. (Sfjd.) G.

Supremacy in future is the lot of the strong nation, the feared people and the country that has formidable fortifications. There is nothing in the clamour of the natives of Kuwait and their love to Iraq, or this latter f s response to the cry any harm for the Shaikh, who should remember that bigger principalities than his are incapable of safeguarding their existence without alliance with a stronger country. In fact, Iraq cannot stand aloof and inactive vis-a-vis the present situation which is about to ruin this Arab principality. Mr. Chamberlain supported Hitler’s proposals in Munich to annex the Sudetan lands to Germany because the natives of that province were of German stock; what is it then that estranges Kuwait from Iraq to which it is linked with racial, linguistic, religious, traditional, characteristic, neighbourly and economic ties ?

' R' ends . After discussing other matters the King and the Prime Minister stressed His Majesty's friendly feelings for the Sheikh of Koweit and pressed me to expedite the acceptance of the friendly overtures mentioned in the Ambassador ’ s telegram No. 66. Having heard them out I said I thought Sheikh would need a lot of convincing of the friendly sentiments which His Majesty had told me that he entertained towards him and proceeded to protest with as much force as I could command against [? improper] behaviour of the Irs^L police, who, I said, had evidently been encouraged to commit these outrages by unrestrained and harmful propaganda which had [gr.undec.] been conducted in this country. The King and his Ministers expressed astonishment and denied knowledge of these events. His Majesty said that he would cause the offenders to be punished. I [gr.omit.] that was least he could do. Prime Minister observed that these incidents only showed how neces sary it was that no time therefore be lost in despatching an envoy from here to Koweit and that the individual whom they had in mind was well equipped in every way to undertake such a mission. He would beable to advise the Sheikh on hovv to administer his country and to convince His Highness that the King of Iraq.' s sole idea was to render assistance in bringing that backward territory up to date, fhe King then alleged that the Sheikh employed Persian police and encouraged Persian emigrants in order to enable him to control his ow:. people. I denied this and when the Prime Minister went on to say how pleased His Majesty would be to send the Iraqi police at any ' 4(LU I time, to help the Sheikh to keep order I ,_p:r.,undec, J rather have thought Kcweit’s recent experience of Iraqi police would have been ^ enough. ,? GTcOmit.] I could say would shake the King and Prime Minis ter from their idea of sending envoy and Later on of inviting Sheikh to Bagdad to bo flattered and decorated. They again begged me to 1 seek your approval for the project. But I hope the Sheikh will be discouraged from responding at any rate until he has received apology for these three latest violations of his territory. If and when apology has been received and the Iraqi Government have given proof of good faith by genuine cessation of propaganda it will be for consideration whether it might not be impolitic to discourage despatch of the King's messenger of friendship. Possibly if as one hopes his relations with Ibn Saud are shortly to be put on a more regular footing the Sheikh would be in a stronger position than he \ o\ yv*-./xw\_r~ ^ w.uld seem to be , gr.undec. ] to L g r * un ^ ec ' ] Ii’aqi blandishments. Impression left on ne by the proceedings at the palace was that Iraqis are aiming effectively to take over protection of Koweit while nominally leaving Sheikh and Bis Majesty s Government in their present position, protests from this Embassy regarding propaganda have hitherto had little effect. I spoke to Prime Minis+er on March 22nd about broadcasting....,broadcasting referred to in your telegram No. 87. I also expressed disappointment that the King in a broadcast to the nation on His Majesty’s birthday in sending greetings to other Arabs in whose future and welfare he was interested, had seen fit to mention those of Koweit together with those of Palestine and Syria. Prime Minister pointed out that he had deleted the three names from original draft and from account issued to the press. I said that nevertheless oriental secretary had heard the broadcast. (There was nothing offensive in broadcast but I thought it well to mention it). I have today reinforced my oral representations about Jahrah with a note requesting an apology (copy of which is being sent to you by air mail) but I do not expect any concrete result.

The King received me in the presence of General Nuri this morning. His Majesty began by saying that on the advice of his j rrime Minister he had taicen necessary measures to discontinue I an y broadcast from his private station which could give offence or be represented as propaganda^ At the same time His Majesty had arranged that he should be spared himself from dealing with numerous telegrams and messages which were at present directed to him personally. I mentioned that Bagdad State Broadcasting Station had recently been closed down. Impression created was that His Majesty desired to obtain a monopoly for his own station. This seemed to me most unfortunate and should be remedied. King and General Nuri both assured me that closing of Government station had been due to technical alterations and that it would be re-opened on Saturday. 'R ' ends . I then told His Majesty that on the strength of these assurances given in the presence of his ^rime Minister I was oro- pared to convey to Your Lordship His Majesty’s earnest hope tfiat there would be no more punitive measures in Koweit. His Malestv and Brime Minister both enquired as to the fate of conciliation proposals contained in my telegram No. -68^ I said that these had no doubt necessitated reference to Government of India and that moral which I feared must be drawn was that mischief can be made much more quietly than it can be repaired.

I asked whether His Majesty really imagined that Iraq, could offer herself as an example at present time: I had repeatedly warned him of impropriety of using his private transmitter set for propaganda of any kind and abuse was aggravated, when as in this question propaganda was of nature to cause us annoyance if not embarrassment. I v.ent on to insist that His Majesty should disclose his real reason for sponsoring these attacks. Ping Ghazi said, that foreign influence[?s] to which his broadcast had referred were Persia and that he and his government ] were seriously concerned over influx of Persians into Koweit „ which they regarded as endangering Iraq's communications with us in the event of war. I replied that we could be trusted to look after that ourselves: I added that while his last government had shown some interest in this question and while I had obtained some information on the subject to communicate to them (your telegram No. 3 Saving) present government had shown no interest in1939 &gt; 2 .

I have told Yusuf Yasin that I see no reason why Ibn Baud should not make it clear to Iraq that Saudi Arabia is interested in the maintenance of the position of the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. The chief Mecca newspaper has published a guarded article in which Ibn Baud is shown as supporting the Sheikh of Koweit personally in this matter.

Rashid Ali declared that last night’s broadcast was contrary to King Ghazi’s orders. Ke undertook at once tc bring the matter to His Majesty's notice and asked Oriental Secretary to give me an assurance that broadcasts about Koweit would be stopped. [End of R.] On reflection I feel that it would be unwise to demand the suppression of broadcasting station. I cannot be sure that present Government would agree: while you are aware that we cannot press Nuri to take action against the King without incurring the risk that he may go further than we wish. I should much prefer that Koweit, Transiordania, etc. should retaliate in kind. I believe that a station can be installed for about £2,000: and Iraqi’s claim to be a progressive democracy is just as vulnerable as is the repudiation of her Royal Family.

For this purpose I feel personally that some public notice of it by Parliamentary Question and Answer is essential.

Government, who had made representations to His Majesty after my conversation with Acting Prime Minister (my saving telegram No.21), regretted subsequent broadcasts and felt they had lost face. There would be no more. I said that press articles v/ere continuing and that I had just heard that Law students had requested authorization to hold demonstration. All this must be stopped. His Majesty's Government had Treaty obligations/2 . obligations towards Koweit, and the situation Iraqi Government in General Nuri's absence had allowed to develop was being rendered absurd by the circumstances that we were being asked to equip an Iraqi Army which according to the press, was to be used for the annexation of Koweit. This was i nonsense but dangerous nonsense. If Government could not control the press by any means other than censorship they must suppress some of the papers as their predecessors had done. Some of the articles read to me as though they were inspired by Germans, which made things worse.

I said that it was evident that reports published in press emanated from completely unreliable sources and it was discreditable to Iraqi press that such rubbish alleging oppression and tyranny should be published by them. ^ Demands made in some papers for annexation of Koweit by Iraq could only lead to embarrassment for Iraq in her relation with His Majesty’s l Government and her neighbours. Naji Shaukat said that he would take what steps he could to damp down press campaign, exceses of which he regretted but which were only typical of lack of restraint commonly shown by press of all countries when following up a M stunt” agitation. At the same time he assured me that in many quarters in Iraq people felt keenly that it was deplorable that the Ruler of Koweit should deny his people any effective share in the Government of the . Principality and that he should spend nothing from his considerable public revenues on education, health or public services of any kind. He was, he said, glad to have this opportunity to tell me that feeling on this point had latterly become so strong that the govern ment had telegraphed to Nuri Said in London asking him to speak privately to His Majesty’s Government and to ask that British influence /influence in Koweit should be used to persuade the Shaikh to develop a uore enlightened government and administration for his country. I said that it seemed that people in Iraq had wrong ideas about Koweit. I had not been there myself but many people who hoXi, had spoken with enthusiasm of the general happiness of the people. There might not be any modern schools, but there were good religious schools, the mosques were well attended and public morality stood high. Kis Excellency rejoined that it was distressing to think that there were people so ignorant and backward that they could be satisfied with a merely religious education and he hoped that I would support the representations which Nuri Said had been asked to make to His Majesty’s Government. I said I should certainly report what he had said to me.

They shouted and cheered for 'Iraq, the King of 'Iraq and his national government. The authorities in Kuwait dispersed them by force and tortured some young men for cheering for 'Iraq. The situation has become veiy serious and unbearable, Arabs have become foreigners and disliked in their country. In the meantime, foreign elements are being encouraged.

S. de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire at Bahrain. Sir, T have the honour to report that on February 12th the Qasr az Zihour Wireless Station, Baghdad, (known here as ’’King Ghazi’s Wireless”) broadcasted some remarks about Kuwait. According to the Arab Staff of this Agency it was as follows ”The announcer said before giving ’’Internal Newsy ”1 shall speak about Kuwait and its Council”, and added that the Qasr az Zihour Station would, in future, be used for propaganda about the condition of the Arab States of the Gulf, although on this particular night his talk would be about Kuwait and its Council only. He attributed to one of the Council the saying that Kuwaitis would fight for their freedom, and went on about Arab Unity in the customary Iraqi way. In spite of the length of his talk it was difficult to grasp any clear meaning, except that he was making propaganda for Iraq”. 2. His Highness the Ruler mentioned the boradcast to me this morning and said how distasteful this sort of thing/p 2 thing made Iraq and the Iraqis to Kuwaitis although it did serve to draw his people closer to him and to the British. 3. At the same visit His Highness produced to me an article from the Baghdad Newspaper *AL ISTIQLAL’ of February 7th about Kuwait; the final paragraph of which reads as follows 'This is the best time for Iraq to take action and do their best to save that country from danger. The future seems very dark, and we are afraid that the result will be disappointing to all Arabs. Because the Arabs cannot imagine losing such a territory which is the precious diamond of the Gulf, and the natural harbour of Iraq. In conclusion, we must consiaer the movements of the liberals of Kuwait and trust them, as they are brave faithful and true Arabs.' I have, etc., Sgd. G.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a note which I have received from the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior concerning the topics which it is probable that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will seek an opportunity to discuss during his forthcoming visits to Geneva and London. 2. Mr. Edmonds’s note reveals some interesting details of the current ideas of Iraqi politicians on the international situation of this country, and it may therefore be useful to those who come into contact with Tewfiq Suwaidi. 3. The Minister of the Interior’s suggestion that Iraq should be made the spearhead of a drive to civilise Arabia is a typical instance of the inordinate vanity which I have noticed to be so common here among those who have found themselves promoted suddenly to high office. I have, &amp;c. W. E. HOUSTOUN-BOSWALL. Enclosure. Note on the Present Orientation of Pan-Arab Policy in Iraq. AMONG the items on the agenda of Saiyid Tewfiq-al-Suwaidi during his forthcoming journey to Geneva and London appear the following :— (a) To discuss the Alexandretta question and cognate subjects; (b) To deal with the position of the Shatt-el-Arab, the Navigation Agreement and the Koweit question (the emphasis is doubtless on Koweit); and {c) To discuss the political situation as it affects the Arab case in the Near East. I he following record of conversations wffiich I had at the beginning of August with my Minister, Saiyid Mustafa-al-Umari, and a day or two later with the Prime Minister, may be useful as throwing some light on the policy underlying these items. 2. I had started my talk with Saiyid Mustafa by saying that I was a little disturbed by a change I had noticed in the Iraqi attitude towards Turkey. Iraq had land frontiers with no fewer than six different States, and it behoved her to remain on friendly terms with as many of them as possible. It was not easy. Relations with Persia were never likely to be cordial; the Persians never forgot and never learned; they had transferred to Iraq (in spite of recent anti-clerical tendencies) the resentment they used to feel at the Sunni-Turkish ownership of the Shia shrines of Kerbela, Najaf and Kadhimain; everv man of them in his heart considered the very existence of Iraq as an insult to the memory of Anushirawan and of Cyrus before him. Relations, of course, were much easier with Saudi Arabia, ruled as it was by a great Arab statesman; but even King Abdul Aziz did not always conceal his belief that he was the natural leader of all the Bedouin, whether inside or outside his State, and that the Euphrates would have made a much more suitable boundary than the present one. It would be idle to pretend that the French in Syria had any love for Iraq, whom thev found, to put it mildly, embarrassingly precocious. The ties binding Iraq to Great Britain were fortunately proof against any strain, but there wa^ friction on the Koweit border over smuggling and friction in the Transjordan direction over Zionism. The one neighbour whom Iraq had hitherto seemed able to [405 q—3]2 understand and get on with had been Turkey ; he had only to glance at the files in the Frontier Section of the Ministry to contrast the almost complete absence of incidents on the Turkish border and the smoothness with which any rare incident was settled, with the mutual vituperation exchanged daily with the Persians, and the constant complaints against the airy violations of the boundary by Saudi tax collectors. 3. I recalled the curious situation that had arisen some years ago when the Dardanelles film “Tell England” had been shown in Bagdad; the scenes representing British troops being mown down on the beach had been greeted with loud applause, while those depicting the Turks in misfortune had provoked violent demonstrations of indignation and grief; I remembered the incident vividly, because the atmosphere in the cinema had been reported to me as being unpleasantly tense, and, fearing the possibility of a brawl between Royal Air Force ranks and the local public, I had myself intervened to have the film prohibited before the run was completed. 4. I said that all this evidence had seemed to show that a common religion and old associations (after all, many of the leading men in the two countries bad been class mates in their youth) had combined to give Turkey, the ex-tyrant, a strong initial advantage over Great Britain, the liberator, in any conflict of emotions that might arise in the Iraqi mind. The Anglo-Turkish rapprochement might almost have been designed by a benevolent Providence to solve the dilemma. Except for the calamity of Palestine all seemed well with the Near East. It was therefore a great disappointment that at that very moment Iraqi relations with Turkey should have taken a less cordial turn. 5. Saiyid Mustafa said that in their hearts they trusted Turkey as little as Persia. The cinema incident which 1 had recalled had reflected not any particular love of Turkey, but rather the accumulated passions generated by years of anti-mandate propaganda. Turkey must dislike an Arab revival on her southern frontiers, and would always do what she could to compromise any such development. Pan-Arab feeling permeated the educated classes (who' alone counted) to an extent which no Cabinet could afford to ignore; even Saiyid Hikmat Sulaiman had had to do public, and indeed emphatic, lip-service to it; they were obliged to intervene to combat the dismemberment of Syria, even if the hope were a forlorn one. The leading men of Iraq had made up their minds that in this modern world of force-politics a small State of under 4 million inhabitants had no prospect of survival, and that their only hope lay in pushing a vigorous policy aiming at a pan-Arab League (that is, not a centralised Arab State). In a world conflict Great Britain would be unwilling to detach forces from the, for her, major theatre of war for the defence of Iraq, or, indeed, for any of her Arab piotectoiates. ( I his con\iction that if ever Iraq has occasion to invoke the treaty Great Britain will not play is deep-rooted and persistent; it is constantly coming to the surface, for instance, in connexion with the Shatt-el-Arab and with the munitions grievance, and now as a justification for pan-Arab activities.) Turkey or Persia, he continued, would hardly fail to seize an opportunity of swallowing Ii aq with hei miserable little army of two or three divisions. But the prospect for the aggressors would be far less attractive if they knew that at the first sign of encroachment twenty divisions of Arabs, trained and equipped for modern warfare, would march from Syria, Palestine, Saudiya, Yaman, Bahrein and the other Gulf Amirates. (I gave the obvious answer that that was a very nice dream which might come true one day; but in the meantime, during the two- division stage, it seemed unwise to go out of their way unnecessarily &amp; to irritate one of these powerful and ex hypothesi greedy neighbours.) 6. To explain his last reference, I must here insert a summary of a conversa tion which I had with the Minister in June of this year, at the time when the coincidence of the agreements between France and Turkey over Alexandretta and Great Britain and Turkey for trade credits (including credits for munitions) had caused some mystification. After saying that the French had no far-sighted Arabian policy, and that we should not deceive ourselves into believing that the Turks would ever be our loyal friends, Saiyid Mustafa went on to ask what had happened to the old traditional British policy of friendship and support for the Arabs. Leaving aside for the moment our inexplicable doings in Palestine why did we not adopt a more realistic policy in the rest of Arabia? Yaman in particular was full of possibilities, yet we seemed content to leave it. and Saudiya and the Gulf Amirates, as savage anachronisms, so many Abyssiniabs, fragilennt tS /l ea 5 V to be sl , nashed b y an y hostile European contact. Why did we not set the ^ in t° 1 modern States as we had Iraq? I reminded the riflo in h j ’ , 0 ! lg ,b b ad com e to Iraq as liberators, we had nevertheless come hmvWn^ d an . h f d ^c^ntry down by force while we laid the foundation of in an ' mi nistration; they themselves had disliked and resented the experience; bn case ’ Slmilar procedure was obviously out of the question in the countries Tran’’ T ntl0ne r i a u d m \ lme of P eace - His answ er was, of course : “ Then use Ii aq could be made the spearhead of a vigorous, realistic, Arabian policy npr«nnar )ll( im P erial interests.' In the past prominent nf Tnnn f • 111 had h ? en es P ecia lly associated with the traditional policy n PPOlt !? g the A r abs to which he had referred; but the giants seemed to have sappeared; was there nobody able to come forward to revive and champion it now . * o • M 7 ;, &lt; ? a ? ° r after the conversation recorded in paragraphs 2 to 5 above oaiyid Mustafa asked me to repeat my views to the Prime Minister. This I did. emphasising my doubts as to the wisdom of pushing Iraq intervention in the Alexandretta question too far, since I understood that Turkey regarded the matter as having been finally settled with the other party to the dispute. Saiyid Jamil-al-Madfai, after repeating much of what his colleague had said regarding the absence of real goodwill on the part of Turkey and the reasons which had led the Cabinet to espouse an active pan-Arab policy, said that actually the Turkish Government had not taken amiss their first attempt at mediation on the basis of ^rtition; he blamed the French, who had no desire to serve an Arab cause and would have resented an Iraqi diplomatic success; the Turks, he felt sure, must leahse that not they but Arabian Iraq had the right to feel aggrieved- he would however, instruct Saiyid Tewfiq not to overdo it.

With regard to despatch No.876, your proposals relating to the Iraq-Nejti frontier also are approved, subject to rectification of a small mistake which occurs in the concluding sentence of the second paragraph of Protocol No.1.

When finally signed, two certified trans lations of the above agreement s should be forwarded to me.

Bourdillon. for High Commissioner for Iraq. London, S.W.lTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT I HAVE the honour to report that, in the course of a visit which I paid to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 12th instant, the Minister raised the question of the international status of Koweit. 2. His Excellency began by saying that the Persian Minister had more than once discussed with him the position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, and had implied that His Majesty’s Government had no more right to exercise a protectorate over Koweit than they had to do so over Bahrein. He had maintained that Bahrein belonged to Persia, and he had suggested that Koweit might very well be claimed by Iraq. 3. Taufiq Suwaidi said that he had replied that the Iraqi Government and Great Britain, and he had refused to be drawn into a discussion about Koweit. Nevertheless, the seeds sown by the Persian Minister had evidently begun to germinate in Taufiq Suwaidi’s mind. He had with him Volume XI of Aitcheson's Treaties, and read out to me article 6 of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement (unratified) of July 1913, inviting my particular attention to the reference to the Sheikh of Koweit as an Ottoman Kaimakam which occurs therein. What, he said, did this mean? Surely it indicated that Koweit was not really an independent State, and was it not arguable that, since in 1913 Koweit had been technically a Kaza of the Basra Vilayet and as the sovereignty of this Vilayet had since then passed from the old Ottoman Empire to the new Iraqi Kingdom, Koweit now stood in relation to Iraq in the same position as it had stood in relation to the Ottoman Empire at the time when the Anglo-Turkish Agreement had been negotiated. 4. Iraq, Taufiq Suwaidi said, had in fact never recognised any change in the status of Koweit. The Iraqi Government had, it was true, in a letter written by Nuri Said as Prime Minister, recognised a certain line as being the frontier between Iraq and Koweit, but as this line was the same as that laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, the reaffirmation of this frontier could not be held, he thought, to have brought any change to the status of Koweit which, judging from the agreement, seemed to have been that of an autonomous Kaza or Kaimakamlik of the Ottoman Empire. 5. The Minister explained that the matter was one of some importance in relation to the ideas which the Iraqi Government had already put forward concerning the stopping of smuggling from Koweit through the control of the Koweiti Customs (see Mr. Morgan's letter to Mr. Baggallay of the 15th March) and the extension of the Iraqi railway to Koweit Bay, in order to provide Iraq with a port on the Persian Gulf (see my despatch No, H6- Qf the 30th March). He thought that in view of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance, His Majesty’s Government should see no serious objection in principle to these projects and it had occurred to him that a re-examination of the status of Koweit on the basis of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of 1913 might reveal a way to overcome any political difficulties of a technical character to which it might seem that these schemes would give rise. 6 I said that the question was one which was largely new to me and 1 could not undertake to make any statement about the status of Koweit until I had had time to study the relevant documents. It seemed to me, however, that his nvprlnokine- the Treatv of Lausanne. Under article 16 of that EASTERN (Arabia). May 2. 1938. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. L^ 38 _J [E 2499/13/91] Copy No. 1J2 Sir M. Peterson to Viscount Halifax.—{Received May 2.) (No. 162.) My Lord, Bay dad, April 19, 1938. regarded the Persian claims to Bahrein as a matter for settlement between Persia [305 b—l]set up in any part of the territory which, under the Treaty of Lausanne, had been detached from the Ottoman Empire. I made it clear, however, that this was a personal view given with all reservations, and I explained that I could give no formal or authoritative reply to the Minister’s enquiries until I had referred to your Lordship for instructions. 7. From such study as I have since been able to make of this question (please 34 -see particularly Sir John Simon’s despatch No. 865 of the 13th December, 1934), it appears that Koweit is recognised by His Majesty’s Government as an independent Government under British protection (Political Resident’s letter to the Sheikh of the 3rd November, 1914) and that from the point of view of international law Koweit s independence began from the date of the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne (6th August, 1924). On this date also, Turkey renounced all rights over Koweit and these rights, whatever they may have been, thereupon terminated and were not transferred to any other State. 8. I should be glad if you would inform me whether I may give oral explanations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the above lines, and I should welcome any additional arguments that it may be possible to put forward, with which to refute the suggestion that Iraq has acquired certain rights over the territory of Koweit. In particular it would, 1 feel, be an advantage to show that the Iraqi Government had in some way recognised both the independence of Koweit and the special relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Ruler of Koweit. Failing that, evidence of the recognition of Koweit’s independence by other Powers would be of value. 9.

He proposes to make short calls on rulers at these places and to assure them of the friendly interest of Iraqi Government.

Further evidence of the Iraqi reluctance to recognise the independence of the Sheikh of Koweit may be found in the Iraqi attitude on the question of the Sheikh’s date gardens in Iraq and in the recent frequent violations of Koweit territory and territorial waters by Iraqi frontier and customs authorities.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a letter, No#0-296, dated the 17th November i.934, from the i olitical Agent, Kuwait, reporting an interesting conversation which lajpr Holmes stated he had had with Mr. Yusuf Ghanima. 2. Major Holmes' veracity is by no means above suspicion but in tnis case I do not see what he had to gain by invent ing the conversation in question, and the view of Kuwait held by the 'Iraq Government is ± should say most unfortunately more or less that summed up by Major Holmes - in ^aragr.ph 7 of Colonel Dickson's letter. 3. Mr. Yusuf Ghanima’s reference to the 'Iraqi Post Office in Kuwait (paragraph 6 of Colonel Dickson's letter) is significant in connection with the views expressed din the Secretary of state for India's express Letter No#x.Z#3434/ 34, dated the 24th august ^934, to the Government of Indio, Foreign and Political De^rtment, (as to which 1 gave my views in my ^x^ress Letter No#1036-S of 8th November 1934 to the Government of India,. oreign and Political Deiartment,copy attached)* 4. Mr* Yusuf Ghanima's reference to a railway from Basrah to Kuwait (referred to by Colonel Dickson in the same paragraph) is interesting* Kuwait is in many ways the natural terminus of the railway not Basrah, ana was originally in pre-war days proposed as the terminus of the Berlin-Baghdad railway.

Apparently Aaj or .'olraae has known -Ir.Yusuf Ghenima for some years, and happened to be in i asra T^ien the latter recently paid a visit to that Town. 3. According to Major Holmes, Mr.Yusuf Ghanima, hearing that his friend waa in Basra, sent for him and enquired whether he, Major Holmes, on behalf of the Kuwait Oil Company or some of his American friends, could not see his way to apply for an Oil Concession in the southern pert of Iraq (Basra Lies). 4. Major Holmes replied Jokingly that neither he ncr any other self-respecting company wanted to have anything to do with the Basra area, as there was no 8l$n of Oil there. 5. After some further *0X1' talk, Yuimf Ghanima turned to the question of the status of Kuwait, and condemned in no uncertain tense the 'stupid obstinacy' of the Shaikh (Ghanima 9 s words) in his dealings with his well meaning mother state' of Iraq. He harped on the fact that the Shaikh was blind and could not see that Kuwait’s interests \ were bound up with Iraq. 6.

Hie Sheikh strongly urges that Arab ideas on hospitality would make it impossible for him to act on these lines and that any action must be taken by H.M.G.3 It is difficult to press the Sheikh on a point such as this, and the Foreign Office, after informal discussion with this Department, have accepted the view (and have so informed Baghdad) that there is nothing ^ for it hut that the iunhassador or the Charge d*Affaires should speak to King Feisal in the sense desired. 1 It has been left to the ^ ^ t- to decide whether it would he better to wait until a visit by King Feisal to Koweit is actually mooted, or whether the first suitable opportunity should be taken.

No.228-3 of 17th torch to you regarding a possible visit by King Feisul to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. We had already written to you (Walton’s letter of 6th April, No. P.2.1772/33) to suggest that the best c ourse would be that the Resident and the Political Agent, Koweit should, as suggested by Humphrys, do what they could to prevent tne Sheikh himself encouraging tne idea of a visit to Koweit should the question arise. After discussion with Fowle the general feeling here was that the detailed procedure suggested in his letter of 17th torch was probably the most suitable in all tne circumstances and, if the Government of India see no objection, we suggest, therefore, that formal approval should be given to it. 2. I enclose a copy of a letter which the Foreign Office have sent - to Humphrys. Yours sinoeroly. lo numpnrys. J. G.

The question generally was discussed at an informal meeting with the Foreign Office at which Colonel Fowle was present on 19th April. The general sense of the meeting was that the detailed procedure suggested in the Resident’s letter to the Indian Foreign Secretary of 17th ferch was suitable and the Foreign Office have now informed Sir Francis Humphrys accordingly. I do not imagine the Government of Inaia will feel very strongly on this question (all that is now in issue is, after all, the detailed procedure, ior the main issue has now been covered by the aetailed instructions already sent them).

Subject to your comments and those of the Government of India, we are inclined to think that there is probably a good deal to be said for action on the lines wnich the Resident proposes, but we shall be glad to know your views. T'Cf.AJtr TpWjfTfUnder Secretary of State, Please see previouo submission on P.Z.177S/33. ,Ve njade it clear to the Government of India that we fully appreciated tne possible difficulties in interfering with a visit to Koweit by King Peisal. The hesiaent has now put forward aetailed suggestions as to how to aeal with the question of such a visit. On the whole, subject to the views of tne Poreign Office and the Government of India, I am inclinea to think that there is much to be saia for the course of action suggestea by Colonel Powle, ana if you see no objection I will consult tne Poreign Office informally aoout it as in the uraft below. The Government of India are unlikely to have any very strong view of their own in the matter.m.; im icY, COIx L . D.o^o.^b- of iy55.

The only way I coula effect tne necessary discouragement would be to inform the Uh* ikh that we objected to His Majesty visiting him. The Shaikh in order to cover himself,(recording to his own story, vide enclosure to my letter Ko.7y2-.&gt; of 19th October last, he hrs alre-dy informed the King that the latter would be welcome *s an unofficial guest), would of course Inform the cling of my advice.

INDIA OFFICE As I told you orally, on receiving your official letter No. P.Z. 7097/32 of the 7th December about possible visits by King Peisal to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, we considered that there was objection in principle to such visits and felt inclined to suggest to you that this should be made clear to the Political Resident, but wished to consult Humphrys on the subject. I understood from you that you thought the India Office would probably agree with such a suggestion, if we made it. I now enclose copies of our letter to Kumphrys and his reply, from which you will see that, while agreeing that^in principle, such visits should be discouraged, he thinks unfortunately that it may be difficult for him to put Peisal off a visit to Koweit, and assumes that the Political Resident will try to prevent the Sheikh of Koweit encouraging such a visit. J.G. Laithwaite, PsqI. ' Will you let us know what the India Office think on the subject and what instructions they would propose to send to Fowle, in order that we may write to Humphrys? I write semi-officially as I understand from Johnstone that this will suit you best at your end.U 6535/6054/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 29th December, 1932. My dear Humphrys, I see that Fowle sent you direct a copy of hie despatch to India No. 792-S of the 19th October, about King Fei6al f s recent enquiries on the subject of possible visits by him to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Fowle proposes to treat each case on its merits, when it arises; and the Government of India have expressed agreement. But we here are disposed to think that any visit by King Feisal to one of these States would be in principle undesirable. The India Office, we understand semi-officially, are inclined to agree. There seem to us to be various indications that King Feisal wishes to try to bring Koweit gradually into closer connexion with Iraq, and that he would favour anything which would tend toward an agglomeration of Arab States under his own aegis. As regards Koweit, it has been laid down by the C.I.D. as recently as 1929 that 'as regards Koweit, it is better 'on the whole that... while endeavouring to secure so far 'as possible that Koweit shall not be identified with 'Iraq, we should defer the establishment of a formal 'protectorate until circumstances appear to make this 'more clearly desirable'. You will see then that our view is entirely against any closer connexion between Iraq and Koweit. As regards the trucial Sheikhdoms, a visit by King Feisal would, it seems to us, be highly embarrassing in view of the traditional policy of allowing them no direct contact with foreign Powers. We His Excellency Sir Francis Humphrys, G. C.M.G. , G.C.V. 0. , K.B.E. , C.I.E. etc., etc. , etc*We feel, therefore, that it would be well to lay down definitely that any desire of King Feisal to visit the Arab States of the Gulf should be firmly discouraged. It would, of course, be for consideration, if the case arises, whether such discouragement could be administered without risking a disproportionately serious political reaction, but it might very well be desirable for the Resident or yourself to nave a definite ruling to go on that in principle H.M. Government are against such visits, as immediate action would probably be required. I should therefore be grateful to know your views on this matter before discussing it further with the India Office. Yours etc. (SGD) GiSORGE RENDEL. (Intd) C.F.A.W.COPY . (B 461/461/91) (72/2/33) British Embassy, Bagdad. 11th January, 1933. My dear Rendel, Please refer to your letter E 6535/6054/91 of the 29th December on the subject of possible visits by King Faisal to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. N I agree that, in principle, such visits should be firmly discouraged unless there is some very special reason for making an exception. In the case cf the Trucial sheikhdoms, it should not be difficult for me to dissuade King Faisal from carrying out any intention he might have of paying them a visit. The case of Kuwait seems to me to be on a different footing and, though I am personally against the establishment of any closer connection between Kuwait and f Iraq than exists at present, it will obviously be much more difficult to convince King Faisal of the justice of our claim that Kuwait is out of bounds for him. You will remember that the Shaikh of Kuwait paid King Faisal a visit in Bagdad last summer, while I was absent in Europe, and it might be claimed by Faisal that it would be discourteous on his part not to return the visit. Then there is the interminable question of the date gardens, and the prevention of smuggling from Kuwait into ’Iraq which has lately assumed rather serious proportions. The Director of Customs recently told me that he estimated that more than £60,000 worth of goods had been smuggled into G.W. RENDEL, ESQ., C.M. G,into ’Iraq from Kuwait during the past year, and that a member of his staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers. It is true that both these matters are not proper subjects for King Faisal to tackle personally, but it might not be easy to put him off a visit to Kuwait for the ostensible purpose of arranging a settlement of such outstanding questions, though the real object of the visit would undoubtedly be political. While, therefore, I should like to be instructed to use my influence to prevent the King paying a return visit to Kuwait, I assume that every endeavour will be made at the other end to prevent the Shaikh himself encouraging the idea should the question arise.

Hitherto, Ibn Saua has been (as Sheikh Ham4a of Bahrein once described him) 'the one big Arab ruler' to whom the Sheikhs of the Gulf naturally look up. Now that Iraq has become an independent state we may possibly find that Faisal will make some effort to establish himself as a political influence in these areas* The local Arab Sheikhs are probably no more anxious to come under the influence of Iraq (the problem is only a serious one in the case of Koweit) than under that of Ibn Gaud, but to judge from the tone of the conversation between King Faisal ana the Sheikh, an account of which/which was submitted: on P.Z.6Q68/32 flagged, a tour by Eis Majesty, while it might be difficult for us to prevent it, would be unlikely to do us much good. 2. The Sheikh of Koweit's statement that any effort on the part of the rulers of Iraq 'to try and come officially” would lead to objections from the Arab rulers may be noted. As the Resident says, the oecision as to the political desirability or otherwise of a visit will oepend on the conaitions prevailing at the time, although an unofficial visit, if there is to be a visit at all, would be preferable. t/ x/gO CONFJDENTTAti .

In the middle of August His Excellency :shaikh Ahmed informed Colonel Dickson that he was very anxious to make the personal acquaintance of His Majesty King Paisal whom he had never met by paying the latter a private visit. I considered that it would be an advantage for His Excellency to do this and on consulting His Excellency the Acting Hif^i coi/imisBloner for Iraq found that he was of the same opinion. At my request, therefore, he ascertained that the visit would be welcome Jo King Faisal and also very kindly furnished transport by HoyaJ Air Force aeroplane for the Shaikh's Journey from Basrah to Baghdad. 3.

I believe the order is of the 1st Class, but I am taking steps to find out about this exactly* 7. In the course of the various conversations which the King had with the shaikh, the former discussed three topics at considerable length (according to the Shaikh)* full details of the stupid effort of Ibn Idfada, which had deservedly ended in his defeat and death* He felt no sympathy at all he said for a person who with only 400 men attempted to conquer a Kingdom* The King then dilated on the objectionable way in which Bin Baud in public regularly heaped abuse on the sons of Ghereef I?Ussain* This was neither chivalrous nor becoming a raonach of Bin gaud’s calibre and standing. Indeed he had taxed the Amir Faisal with the matter when the latter was in Baghdad. The King asked the Shaikh many questions of his relations with Bin Saud find what he thought of his personally, to which the Shaikh says he gave reply to the effect that apart from the Blockade and the ham it was doing Kuwait, he had nothing to complain of, indeed he looked on Bln Baud as his good friend, and could never fprget his recent charming treatment of him;'elf when In Kladh. searching questions about the Blockade and whether the shaikh held a 'document* from His majesty's Government (a) Ibn Bifada's Rebellion.
