            Government (No 1148 and 1318), dated 8 August and 13 September 1822. It notes the
            Resident's regret that the Government disapproves of his decision to leave his
            station for Shiraz. In his defence, it explains that the Resident waited a month, and
            only submitted to Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā's commands after he had received repeated
            firmauns [firmans] from him; the Resident also believed that non-compliance would have
            had a negative impact on relations between Britain and Persia.It is noted that the station at Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū]
            remains as it was, as per the Government's instructions to maintain two agents in
            the Gulf of Persia until further notice.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000095#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
