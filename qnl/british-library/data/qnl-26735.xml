Sir, ioui' xcelifenc/ 5 &amp; obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State.) t U v !867A4A8 OOMyiD£i;TI;\L 3ir With refc reiice to my despatch l^o.12ii of the 3rd July las t^, regarding the appointment of Professor Abdul MajicTKhcin as Indian Consul at Jedda, I have the honour to inform you that Professor Abdul majid Khan has now received His Majesty’s Commission, and he presented it to the Ministry of Foreign Aff irs on the 13th September, under cover of a letter addressed by h mself to H.R.H. the Amir Faisal, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Professor Abdul Majid Khan is now notifying the heads of diplomatic Missions in Jeudaof the establishment of the Indian Consulate in Jedda, and of his assumption of hie duties as Consul. 2. Though I regard this procedure as unorthodox, I have acquiesced in the steps taken by Professor Abdul Majid Khan, who has kept throughout in close touch with my Chancery, as I understood that the Government of India desired their Consular represntative in Jedda to be completely independent of this Hrabasey. It was for the same reason that, as I reported in my despatch under reference, I informed Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, when I introduced Professor Abdul Majid Khan to hi ,, that correspondence relating to Indian affairs should be addressed to professor Abdul Majid Khan direct. Nevertheless, I cannot regard as satisfactory the present .position in which, while the Government of India is [represented in Jedda by an independent consular officer, lit is apparently uesired by them that I should permanently represent their diplomatic interests. The fact that professor Abdul Majid Khan’s Commission was submitted to the Minister of Foreign Affairs by him, elf and not by me is, I think, a clear indication to the Saudi Arabian Government that I am not in fact representing Indian diplomatic interests, and I trust that I shall hear before long that the Government of India no longer regard me as their diplomatic representative, 3. I feel it desirable in this connection to bring to your notice that Professor Abdul Majid Khan, whom I have personally found most co-operative and tactful in his behaviour, has encountered certain difficulties in his relations with the Saudi Arabian Government. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, to whom I presented Professor Abdul Majid Khan on his arrival, extended a warm welcome to him and offered him full co-operation. Since, however, the Ministry has been in charge of Shaikh Khairuddin el Zureikly, Professor Abdul Majid Khan has been somewhat embarrassed by the failure of the Ministry of Foreign /Affairs The Right Honourable Ernest Be»in, M.P., etc, etc, etc, Foreign Office.(V) 2 ) Affairs to deal with , or eve# to acknowledge, an^ matters which he submitted to diem. Shaikh Khairuddin explained to a member of my staff that he found it difficult to deal officially ith the Indian Consul because he had received no document formally ai;nouncing his aj'i oin tment, ^nd he pointed out that no such difficulty arose in the case of the Vice-Consul of Pakistan because he is still a member of my staff. Professor ibdul Majid Khan took exception to the fuct that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should have had any hesitation in extending to him provisional recognition penoing the arrival of his Coumiseion, and 1 took advantage of an informal meeting aith dheikh Khairuddin to mention Professor Abdul Majid Khan’s embarrassment to him. ohuikh Khairuddin und^rt^ok to do what he could to help Professor Abdul Majid Khan, and the difficulty was in fact resolved in the next few clays by the arrival of Professor Abdul iajid Khan’s Commission* The professor lias, however, been conaioerably irritated by what he considers a lack of normal international courtesy, and 3 believe that he is reporting on the matter to his Govern ent, as he considers that the difiiculties were intentionally created tor political reasons, and were possibly inspired by the inimical remarks of the Pakistan Vice-Consul, hich I have reported elsewhere, on the occasion of the recent celebration of the Indepen ence of Pakistan. professor Abdul Majid Khan is also suspicious of the jaudi vrabian Government’s relations with Hyderabad, on &gt;.hich I have also reported elsewhere, and he is conscious of a marked lack of sympathy towards his Government and himself. 4.

We feel that as the Deputy High Commissioner in London has not really understood your original letter to him outlining the accepted diplomatic procedure, there is no real advantage in pursuing that aspect of the matter with him, now that the Indian Consul has arrived in Jedda.

CONFIDENTIAL (My dear G-rafftey) I would be grateful if you would take sane opportunity of drawing the attention of the Pakistan Government to the unsatisfactory position which now exists here. As you know, the position has been that I have represented both Dominions, with the assistance in Pilgrimage matters of the Indian Vice Consul and his staff, and all accounts have been sent to New Delhi for apportionment in an agreed ratio between the two Governments. 2. Now however several things have happoied which leave an extremely confused and in ny view most unsatisfactory situation. First of all, the Indian Government arranged through their Higji Commissioner in London in April last to appoint a Consul to reside at Jedda, and their representative, a Professor Abdul Majid Khan, has now arrived and will no doubt shortly apply for his exequatur. He is in fact unable to work as he has not yet acquired an office, and his clerks, although they are expected shortly, have not yet arrived. Nevertheless, at least from the date on which he presents his credentials, he will nominally at least be in independent charge of all Consular functions on behalf of the Govemment of India, and the existing staff will devote themselves exclusively to Pakistani affairs. Likewise some new arrangement will be required about finance; presumably the accounts will be sent to Karachi. 3. As far as Pakistan is concerned there is a similar confusion; the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan agreed some time ago to exchange diplomatic representatives with the rank of Minister. Saudi Arabia's Minister has already left for Karachi, and the Pakistani Ambassador in Cairo has been nominated as Minister to Saudi Arabia, and King Ibn Saud has given his agreement. He has not yet visited this country to present his letters, but nevertheless this produces the somewhat anomalous position that I continue to represent Pakistan's interests, and, through the Indian Section, to deal with their Pilgrimage and Consular matters, despite the fact that a Pakistani Minister has already been appointed. 4. It seems to me most desirable that the Govemment of Pakistan should take immediate steps to make their representation here effective, which can be dene almost at a stroke of the pen: they have a staff here which is competent to deal with all pilgrimage matters, which of course are 99/» of their work, and they have a suitable building to which the Indian Govemment lays no claim. I feel this, not merely because of the manifest absurdity of the present situation, but because the longer letters continue to be addressed to the Embassy, the more difficult owing to lack of records will be the position of the Pakistani representative when his office does at last become independent. As you will realise, we are not in a position to maintain duplicate Archives for handing over. A further - though entirely domestic point - is that the present staff are still, nearly a year after partition, without any information about their future, and furthermore continue in the old Central Government rates of pay, which have been in effect 'frozen” on account of the uncertainties.of the situation and which as you know are grossly inadeqiate. This aspect of the matter will not be improved when the clerks appointed by India arrive, as they will receive almost exactly double the salary of the present clerks. 5. I appreciate that staffing, in the sense of selecting a man as Pakistan's representative on the spot, probably presents some difficulties: Shahjehan is an excellent Pilgrimage Officer, but I would doubt his suitability as a permanait Charge d'Affaires. He should, however, be a perfectly adequate 'stop-gap' Acting Consul. However, that is not a question on which I feel called on to make any suggestions unless specifically asked to do so. It may be of interest to you however to know that I have seme reason to believe that if he is not selected for the appointment, he may adopt Saudi nationality with a view to taking employment under the Saudi Arabian Government.

Yours every HIGH COMMISSION Chancery Jedda.THE STATESJMN : NEW DELHI 14th June 1943 CONSUL-DESIGNATED VIEW: Prom Our Correspondent. The Indian Consul-designate to Saudi Arabia, Prof. Abdul Majid Khan in an interview on Sunday said it would be his ’’privileged duty” to look after the convenience of the thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrim.' who every year visit the holy places of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. This year, he expected, there will be over 10,000 Haj pilgrims from the Indian Union. In the pre-partition days, he added, about 20,000 pilgrims used to visit the holy places every year. This year the first ship with Haj pilgrims will leave Bombay on June 20. The Professor said that there were a contingent of doctors and two dispensaries, one at Jedda and the other at Mecca, under the management of the Indian Government, to look after the health of the Indian pilgrims who generally stay there for about four to siE months. The Indian Government has suitable machineries to meet other contingencies also. The Consul-designate thou-ht that there were great possibilities of developing Indo-Arabian trade relations. Arabia was a natural market for Indian manufactured articles and he agreed with the su^eostion that a commercial museum containing samples of Indian products should be stationed in Jedda. This would facilitate acquaintance of Indian products with the prospective buyers not only in Saudi Arabia, but in all the Muslim countries in the Middle East, as the seaport of Je^da was, so to say, the gateway to the Muslim holy places for thousands of pilgrims every year from all Muslim nations.Pol.Ext. 16333/48 DRAFT LETTER.

It seems, however, that he is using * t&gt; the wor$ accredited in a loose sense and not in its proper meaning of the accrediting of/Diplomatic Representative‘whicy implies the issue of Letters of Credence. 3. The position as we see it is as follows /H.M. _I l/ k ' H,M./Ambassador is the sole Diplomatic Representative L + of His Majesty in Saudi Arabia and until the Government of India appoint a Diplomatic Representative of their own he is the only channel of communication between the Governments of Saudi Arabia and India* Indian Consul could not at the moment be set up in Saudi.

The Indian Consul would, however, naturally have to deal through the^Embassy on matters^not strictly pertaining to his functions as a Consu If this were to be explained to the Government of India it might satisfy them since we do not read ndia it might sa WVVH**V*I the|^/letters as expressing the intention that the / Indian i ^• v \ fIndian Consul should be accredited to the- (■i nmnmm ill nf Saudi Arabia in the proper diplomatic sense. 4.

We are unable to follow the argument that diplomatic usage requires that Consular Officers should always work under an accredited diplomatic representative. The Government of India already have Consular Officers abroad accredited to the Governments concerned. There'are also li number of foreign Consular Officers in India whose countries have no diplomatic representatives in India. 3. The proposed Consulate at Jedda will deal primarily with pilgrimage to Mecca and the intention of the Government of India is that the Consulate should work under the direct supervision of the . Government of India, though it would of course keep in very close touch with the British Embassy. 4.

Ambassador at Jedda will shortly cease, _ The position at present is that the Indian Vice-Consul at Jedda, Mr. Shah Jehan, and his three clerks were apx-)ointed by the Government of India (old style; to look after Indian pilgrims and other Indian interests and formed part of the stafl of H*M. Embassy in Jedda, who represent the Government of India with the Government of Saudi /a^abia. This position was not substantially changed by the xoartition of India and, by agreement with the Government of Pakistan, New Delhi have continued to make arrangements for all pilgrims whether from India or Pakistan, on behalf of II M Embassy in Jedda. Mr. Shah Jehan and his staff 1 have, hov/ever f or service Pakistan, and it mav be this which has prompted the Goverrinent of India now to take steps to appoint their own Consulate. F.A.K. Harrison, Esq-* Coiunonwealth Relations 0 /You willYou will realise, however, that a Consul &lt;^not he accredited to the government of another country, and in fact there is no such thing as an 'independent 11 Indian Consulate. It would therefore he useful, I think, to clarify the position hy ascertaining from the Indian Government whether (a) the new Consul will merely replace Mr. Shah Jehan on the staff of H.M. Embassy (in which case H.M* United Kingdom Ambassador will continue to represent the Government of India with the Government of Saudi Arabia and Mr. Shah Jehan will presumably either be recalled or will be appointed to perform similar duties on behalf of Pakistan nationals only) or (b) the new Consul will be placed under the wing of the nearest Indian Diplomatic Mission, which would theh be accredited also to Ibn Saud and thus take over complete responsibility for Indian rex^resentation in Saudi Arabia. Of the two above alternatives, the second would undoubtedly be preferred by H.M. Embassy in Jedda, since it would relieve them of a heavy and trying burden of work. Moreover, a precedent is provided by the position of the Chinese Consul at Jedda, who comes under the fomal supervision of the Chinese Minister in Cairo. You may feel, however, that, for political reasons, it is useful for H.M. Ambassador to continue to rex^resent the Government of India (the new Consul forming part of his staff) since assistance of this kind underlines the value to India of the Commonwealth connection. In that &lt;case, presuming the Government of India v/ish it, we would be prepared to continue to represent India in Saudi Arabia. (T. S.

Scale of payment of India Vice Consul seems to have been fixed on appointment of Ihsanullah who ms (a) a resident in Hejaz and locally engaged (b) in trade. The £200 per annum increase granted to Bokhari was appropriate to the post and I regret its suppression. 5. Post of Indian Vice Consul carries valuable local prestige and involves obligations of hospitality all the year round which become most embarrassing in the pilgrim season. Motor car is an expensive necessity. Some comparison with status and emoluments or Legation doctor who earns large sums in private practice is inevitable. 4.

Sir, I am directed to refer to Despatch from His Hajesty’s Minister, Jedda, ilo.601/153/20, dated the 17th Harch 1938, addressed to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department with copy to the Principal Secretary of State for foreign Affairs (x'io.hO) and to say that, in the li^ht of the suggestions made by him in his Secret Despatch i.o.638/130/21, dated the 24th April 1937 (copy enclosed) the Government of India selected Seyyid Lai Shah Bukhari, T'.A., of the Punjab Provincial Civil Service to officiate for the post of British (Indian) Vice Consul, Jedda, on the terms specified in the Government of India, External Affairs Department express letter i*o«i7 •!!(48)-G/37, dated the 18th September 1937 (copy enclosed) and the officer has been hold in t, charge of the post from the forenoon of the 25th October 1937. It is much regretted that at the time of making the appointment the necessity for consulting His Majesty's Government and obtaining their formal orders on the appointment was over-looked. 2 RECEIVED P. 4 J. DilP 1 2 3 MAY 193t INDIA OFFICE2. In the circumsuances, I am to request that His Majesty’s Government may kindly be moved to accord the necessary sanction in the mat&amp;er* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.Copy of a Secret despatch io.638/130/21» dated the 24th April 1933, from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Hew Delhi. The fact reported in my letter no.636/130/20 of April 24th that Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah will not return to his post after the leave which is about to take, raises the question of the appointment of another official to succeed him as Indian Vice-Consul. I assume that although Khan Bahadur Ihaanullah will continue to draw leave pay in respect of this post for about two years before retirement, this will not prevent the appointment of an acting Vice- Consul to do the work of the post. 2* The selection of an official will I fear not be an easy task. It will be remembered that it was formerly the custom to give the title of Vice-Consul to the Indian Assistant Surgeon attached to the British Agency end Consulate, This did not always work well, and it was eventually decided to give the title to Munshi (afterwards Khan Bahadur) Ihsanullah who had already specialised in the pilgrimage work. This plan had the advantage of ensuring continuity, but it had a disadvantage, since no official performing such duties could hope to remin persona grata to the Saudi Arab Government for ever. Then it firat appeared desirable on public grounds that Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah should cease to hold the post, a long and in the end embarrassing delay occurred because Khan Bahdur Ihsanullab’s employment was local and there was no other post to which he could be transferred. This experience leads to the conclusion that the post should be held by a permanent employee of the r * rnmen t o^. In did, so tnat-^a ch ang e can be road e e v e f'v f e v&lt; years. The old system under which the Doctor attached to the Legation was also the Vice-Consul is not recommended.Other reasons apcirt, the Doctor has quite enough to do to carry out his medical duties, which are heavy arid highly important• by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, who has grown up with the pilgrimage work and knows it better than anyone elee, and who moreover knows personally every person of importance in the Hejaz. But a different technique may have to be employed, and it is hoped that a man can be found who will be able to make the most of the changing conditions. The work during the height of the pilgrimage is very hard; it has to be done at high speed, and it often keeps the Indian Vice-Consul busy for two or three times as many hours at a stretch as the ordinary official would think a days work. It requires a good deal of diplomacy, and is likely to require even more in the future. Strength 01 character to resist the blandishments of the mutawwifs and wakils, and inflexible honesty, are essentials, and if possible there should also be an even temper to support the complaints of the pilgrims, the dishonesty of the mutawwifs and wakils, and the persecution of the Indian agitator. 4 . It is desirable that the new official should arrive by the beginning of the pilgrim season. It would just do if he came with the first pilgrim ship from India, but it would be better if he could be sene so as to arrive a month earlier in order to ave time to acquaint himself with the outline of his duties before the feeiitK flood of pilgrims begins. I trust that a good candidate for the post will be found soon and that he will be sent to Jedda in good time. 5.
