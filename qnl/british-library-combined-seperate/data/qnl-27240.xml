Also discussed was Seyid Saulem [Salim II bin Thuwaini] who was in Shargeeah [Sharjah] and with whom the Chief of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] had offered to mediate however Saulem's demands of a pension of 600 dollars per menseur and permission to reside within Muscat territory were unacceptable to the Sultan.The Sultan also discussed Seyid Faysul [Faisal bin Turki Al-Said], who he believed was more likely to succeed than Seyid Ibrahim and who was ruling at Rostak [Rustaq] but had suffered a loss at the hands of the Beni Ryam [Bani Riyam] tribe.The meeting also discussed Zanzibar and the Sultan requested Pelly's assistance in ensuring the arrears of the Zanzibar subsidy were paid and continued to be received or that the British Government would grant him permission to seize Zanzibar.The meeting concluded by discussing Seyid Abdool Azeez [Abd'al Aziz Al-Said] who the Sultan believed might continue to disturb the peace in Oman, but who he was still willing to offer a pension of 200 dollars to, provided he resided away from the Muscat territories.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024195008.0x000009#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
