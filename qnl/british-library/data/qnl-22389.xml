After Compliments, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the Amir of Muharraqhas again committed au offence by referring the case of certain Hassawie with their Nakhuda firstly to the Salifa Court, and afterwards to the Shara' Court of Qadhi Shaikh fesim bin Mehza' without first referring the matter to your friend. I how therefore write this letter as a protest against such action on the part of Your Excellency’s Amir. 2. Your Excellency is well aware that the same Amir came to apologize to me personally in company of Jasim Chirawi, in connect ion with such matters, a few days ago, and promised not to commit such an offence again, but it appears he has forgotten what he promised and apologized for. I again beg to invite your Exceliencys attention, and to request that you will again warn the aforesaid Amir to be careful. I am very sorry to have to make such complaints to Your Excellency but matters of this nature which are difficult and cannot be overlooked compel me to do so.
