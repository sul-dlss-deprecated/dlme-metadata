Dear Metcalfe, Thank you for your letter of the 5th April (D. 1285-N/39) in which you enquired whether the Iranian Government would be willing to agree to the appointmant of the Medical Officer, Meshed, as a Vice-Consul say at Meshed or Birjand. authorities in the past were, as you know, due to our desire that Medical Officers should be allcv/ed to engage in private practice, and to the refusal of the Iranians to grant licences for such practice. But if a Vice- Consul is appointed who is also a Medical Officer, and if (as I understand would be the case) he confines himself to treating the members of the Consulate staff, I do not see that the Iranian Governnent would be in any way concerned. As the officer in question would not practise outside the Consulate he would require no licence and it would be no concern of the Iranian Government if he chose to treat the members of the Consulate staff. This view appears to be confirmed by the case of Dr.Fazal Haq which you mentioned in your letter. On the other hand we cannot be certain that in the particular case of the preseit Medical Officer at Meshed the Iranian Government might not object owing to our differences of opinion in the past. I think therefore it would be much better not to raise this thorny question with them now, especially as you do not wish to recommend such an appointment at present. But if and when a successor is appointed to the present Medical Officer we could simply apply for his agreement as Vice- Consul. The Iranian Government would then not know that he was also a Medical Officer and I do not think that they would have any grounds for objection. The difficulties which arose with the Iranian Yours sincerely, Sd/- H. J. Seymour. Sir H. A. F.

I grlfee this suggestion, not because a titular V.C* is really necessary in Meshed during the summer but because it would be very useful to us to Know whetnei the Persian Government, who have refused to allow an officer who is licensed to practise medicine to mafa work also as a Vice-Consul, will maintain tiieir refusal now that they have declined to grant a license tc our medical officer. If they should agree to the proposal this summer it would then be possible for us with some confidence to put forward the name ot an i.m.b. oiiicer as Vice-Consul Zabul should we wish for ether reasons to make such a suggestion. It is that I have already made this suggestion to the Minister in Tehran who is not himself anxious to put it up, fearing perhaps that it would not be accepted, but I do not myself think that this is a valid objection.

Captain O'Connor, Indian radical service, duly arrived in Marefe to take up his duties as Me icol officer on the staff of Hi© Majesty’s Consulate-General for Khorassan. on the 7th April, before the documents to support his application for a medical licence had been received in His Majesty’s Lega tion, I was orally informed by the Head of the European Depart ment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Iranian Govern ment could not after ell grant a licence to Captain O’Connor, who must therefore confine hie practice to the staffs of His Majesty's Consular posts. Monsieur Ansarie said that this decision, for which he apologised profusely, was based mainly on the undesirability of permitting a system which would have to be extended to ^others 1 * - i#e. Hussians. 2 . i objected strongly to this reversal of the Iranian Government's previous decision, and pointed out that, relying on that decision, the Medical Officer had actually arrived. But the most I could obtain from Monsieur Ansarie was a promise to enquire whether the agreed arrangement could not be allowed to continue during the present Medical Officer's tenure of the post. In spite of repeated attempts, I have been unable to obtain a reversal of the Iranian Government’s decision, and as reported in the despatch to the Government of India, of which /I The Right Honourable Anthony sden, M.C•, M.F•, etc., etc., etc., The Foreign ofrice, S. .1s © I have the honour to enclose a copy, I have now been informed that the Iranian Government have tofcen a general decision not to grant any further licences for general practice to medical officers attached to the staffs of His Majesty’s Consulates* 3* For the reasons stated in paragraph 3 of my despatch to the Government of India I do not think that it will be possible to contest this decision* I should be grateful to be informed in due course whether you concur in this view* 4* I am sending copies of this despatch to the decre tory to the Government of India in the jsxternal Affairs Depart ment under cover of my despatch No* 163, to the Acting politi cal Resident in the Persian Gulf Ho* 76 and to His Majesty’s Consul-General fox’ KhorasGan Ho* 61* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, huHtole Servant, (Signed) H*d* Seymour*/ Translation of a Hote from ths Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Third political Departnont) to Hia peaty’s Legation* m. 2076^/1879, 36th \irdad f l;5l6 (17th August,1937).

Having conceded last year principle that Consular officers ought not to exercise second profession I do not see that we can resist request to separate functions of Vice-Consul and doctor. (2) We must obviously ask for certain respite while we consider arrangements for the future but I would advocate termination either of Consular or medical appointment as soon as possible. Last year Iran profited from three months grace which they gave us at Zabul to establish their own hospital there and at the end of that period told us that there was no longer any need for our doctor. To reduce the risk of similar experience at Birjand you may think it desirable to terminate Fazle Haq 1 s consular appointment and to inform the Iranian (Jovernment at the earliest possible date of our intention to maintain his status as doctor. If so it would probably be well to add that future consular arrangements are under consideration. (3) What Iran asks for however is the termination of medical appointment. This may be due to familiar objection of dual capacity and to possibility of doctor enjoying some consular immunity when circumstances do not justify it. But there/—there is no doubt risk that they may eventually prove sticky about licensing a medical successor to ]?azle Haq. (4) Suggest Consul-General Khorasan should be invited to give early views as to future of Birjand post.

Presumably however he performs few Consular functions while Daly is there. Coula we not now announce termination of his appointment as Vice-Consul and re submit application for medical license ? This is dependent however on your ability to send new Vice-Consul before Daly goes to Meshed or on its not mattering leaving Zabul for short time after that without Vice-Consul.

Iranian Government do not care whether P(yper) is doctor or Consular Officer but argue that he cannot be both. Be fa ctr position is that P(yper) is recognised as Consular Officer bun not as doctor and since November he has only been allowed tc practice as doctor on sufferance and on the understanding we would take early steps to separate dual functions of doctor and Consul. There is no evidence available here that Iranian Governmem object to our hospital at Zabul, Their attitude has always been that if P(yper) did not hold Consular rank there would be no objection to issue to him of medical license.

I have no wiah to adirooata any particular eolation in advance of iialhi diecuaeiona, but 1 feel that Hie Majesty*e Minister should be aware of following considerations. If a case were to arise here where a foreign salaried consular officer who was also a uuly physician desired to carry on a private medical practice His Majesty’s Oovernaent would probably raise no objection. But ii were then to be involved in judicial proceedings arising out of his medical practice, he could not invoice his consular position. If therefore en incident were to arise involving defence of some medical Vice-Consul^ conduct in professional sphere Hia Majesty's aovermaent would not bs entitled to do aare for him than for any other British doctor. Results mi^t obviously be embarrassing. Risks of an incident would naturally be much smaller if Vice-consuls were to confine their medical practice to consular staff.

Persian Government are making difficulties about grant of license to practise medicine to Lieutenant Colonel Fyper on the ground that it is a wrong principle that Consular Officer should also exercise another profession. They argue that if in his medical (? capacity) he was guilty of some irregularity or was sued by a patient awkward situation of consular privilege wound arise. I explained to official of Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Colonel Pyper manages big_ hospital almost entirely for the benefit of the poor of Zabul where there is no otner hospital or regular doctor. Moreover if he were practising upon members of the Consulate staffs in east Persia he would not ^ have enough to do and no good doctor would stay on in such conditions with resulting inconvenience to the Consulates. The official asked whether Colonel pyper could not remain as 'member of tne staff' but without the rank of vice coml hut I pointed out the difficulty of .communicating with Governor during many montns when Consul General is in Meshed.

[E 7225/2960/34] Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 3.) (No. 497.) Sir Tehran, November 13, 1934. THE following curious story has just come to my notice : it may possibly be a symptom of the dissatisfaction which must exist somewhere in Persia, and may even presage more serious disorders to come. I therefore have the honour to bring it to your notice. . . 2. For some time past the students at the school of medicine, which is supervised by the Ministry of Public Instruction and is directed by a Peisian doctor named Dr. Bakhtiar, have been inclined to show their dissatisfaction at the teaching and methods of their director. Dr. Bakhtiar, an uncouth but energetic man, has worked himself up by prodigious efforts from a \ery humble origin, and has been through a full medical education in America ; he holds strong views on the desirability of hard work and thorough training. 3. The usual course of medical training at the Persian School of Medicine has hitherto lasted five years. Dr. Bakhtiar holds the opinion that an extra year is necessary. Without submitting his proposal to either the students oi the faculty of medicine, he, by direct but irregular methods, succeeded in obtaining the consent of the “Shora” (the High Council of Public Instruction) to his proposal for the sixth year, dhis meant that those students \\ho were just completing their fifth year, and were looking forward to earning money through regular practice, suddenly found that they were obliged to support themselves for another year. 4. The dissatisfaction came to a head about ten days ago. Pickets had been placed outside the medical school with a view to stopping the students fiom attending any classes therein. Dr. Bakhtiar, after consulting with the Inspector- General of the Ministry of Public Instruction, sent for the police and instructed them to put the picketers in prison. The police carried out these instructions. 5. A crowd of students then beseiged the Ministry and the Acting Minister. Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Hikmat, came out and delivered a speech on the steps of the building of the Ministry. The inspector-general was dismissed, the five years’ course was reinstated, the prisoners were released, and Dr. Bakhtiar s classes were, it is believed, discontinued. The students, having taken the oppor tunity of smashing the windscreen of Dr. Bakhtiar's car and taking off all four wheels and throwing them in the gutter, dispersed. 6. Hikmat, incidentally, made another change. Dr. Blair, of the American Mission Hospital, had been giving anatomy lectures—another of the innovations of Dr. Bakhtiar. The lectures were not very successful, in the absence of corpses; the size of the class, which numbered 200, was also an obstacle to proper teaching. Hikmat announced that the classes were to be discontinued. The fear that the clergy of Tehran, whose dislike of such irreligious activities as surgery is intense though at present inarticulate, might cause trouble is said to have been one reason for Hikmat s decision in this matter. The result of this shrewd stroke is that Hikmat’s position is a little stronger, the students are satisfied with less to do, Dr. Blair is relieved of an irksome duty, and the present batch of young Persian doctors will know nothing about anatomy. 7. The students have now returned to their studies. Some think that the ringleaders will eventually learn that the authorities will have the means of getting their own back by dealing with the recalcitrants singly, when the effect of their victory has evaporated. As I write, I also hear that there is no real intention to rescind the decision to have a six years’ course instead of five. What ever the truth of this odd affair is, it is certain that young Persia has, at last, shown a certain tendency to rebel against arbitrary imprisonment. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE.

I am accordingly to request that, if you see no objection, the Persian Government may kindly be approached to allow the medical officers posted in South ana East Persia whose stay is not likely to exceed 4 months to remain without Persian registration for so long as their medicalmedical attendance is confined to the Consular staff. 1 am to add that snould the period of duty at these Consulates be likely to exceed 4 months the Government ol India will take requisite steps to see that their medical officers are correctly registered.

The Government of India note that definite rules for the guidance of doctors posted to Persia in future will be formulated as a result of experience gained from the submission of applioations of those already serving in Persia.

In such dasei no junior Sub* assistant Suzgeon oan ever be posted to Persia. A medical man qualifies after a long period of training and having received hie diploma and registering it with a provincial Medical Council is considered fit to practice. The addition of a further live years after qualification seems to be an unreasonable and irksome requirement. M.

British Legation, Tehran. 5th April, 1954. Sir, In confirmation of my circular telegram Ho. 4 of 4th April, 1934, regarding the formalities to he completed hy foreign doctors applying for licenses to practice medicine in Persia, I transmit to you a table showing in detail the documents to he submitted hy all future applicants and cancelling all previous instructions. Some of the documents and certifications laid down in this table may prove unnecessary or redundant in practice and for doctors and others applying for licenses in the future, some modification of the table may prove possible. But for those who are already established in Persia, and must submit their applications before May 20th next, it is better to take no risks and to send too many documents rather than too few. 2. A separate schedule shows the number of copies of the printed form of application to the General Department of Health which is being sent, as an enclosure to this despatch, to each superintending post, as well as the names of those doctors whose applications have already reached the Legation. Any other documents required to complete the applications of those on the list according to the instructions in the table are being copied or translated in the Legation and certified in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Similarly, in the case of any applications already despatched Yjy but not, according to the schedule, in tho hands of the Legation, you may assume, unless you receive a telegram to the contrary, that the only additional documents you need despatch His Majesty’s Consular Officer5 Rials 2,000. Rials 1,000. despatch are the printed form of application and enough photographs to bring the total number up to six. 3* The British University degrees at present recognised by the Ministry of Education are*- (a) London, Cambridge, Manchester, Durham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Dublin, Oxford, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, Glasgow. \ (b) Madras, Calcutta, Bombay. It is stated that this list will be completed later. 4. I am informed that the General Department of Health will collect the fees of Rials two thousand payable by physicians and surgeons, and of Rials one thousand for dispensers, etcetera, at the time of the issue of the license. All applicants should therefore be ready to remit this sum to the Legation by telegraphic transfer when called upon to do so. The receipt of a telegram with the one word ♦♦PORTUHATE” followed by a name will mean that the application of the doctor concerned has been accepted and that a license will be issued when the fee, which must be remitted at once to the Legation, is paid. I am proposing to address the Persian Government shortly on the question of the fees payable by Consulate Medical Officers and to suggest that one payment should cover both the officer immediately concerned and his successors during a period of ten years. ,,1 should be ready to argue that fees and even licenses were I unnecessary for Consulate doctors did they not all, as I I understand, desire to be free to engage in private practice I and to accept payment therefor.B.

In future all such doctors will be required to take out a license to practice. The formalities to oe observed are as follows ;- 1 . The original diploma of applicant, or a duplicate thereof (which has been certified by a Persian representa tive abroad) must be attached to the application. 2. A photo of applicant must be attached to the dioloma or duplicate &amp; be sealed, either by the issuing school of medicine or by a Persian representative. 3. An original certificate issued by an official authority proving that the applicant has practiced medicine for at least five years since completing the course of study. This must be certified by a Persian representative. ENCLOSURE IN \ IrtDiA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S i tor No E2 ,vi. ] l L..vh. rr ’APR. 1934 4.4* copies of every diploma &amp; dociunent wtiicfc the applicant submits, together viith t'ao translations, all of which must be certified as to correctness by an authority appointed by the Ministry of Public Instruction. (The authority has not been specified but will presumably be the ministry for ifloreign Affairs since no officials in the Provinces would have the requisite linguistic qualifi cations) . 5. The original &amp; a copy of the per lit of Residence in Persia^ of the owner of the document (applicant?) 6. Two small half-length photographs measuring 5X9 c.eu As all these formalities will have to be completed in future by our I.M. 3* officers appointed to ^bul &amp; oy the Sub-Assistant surgeons posted to Persia, it is requested that these regulations may be brought to the notice of the Director General of Indian ledical Services. As regards the above forn»lities:- (l) Original Diplomas of I.M.S. officers are, 1 understand, kept by the officers themselves. I imagine however that few officers travel about with such documents so tliat the posting oi an ofiicer to '-^bnl .. r elsewhere in Persia will need to be decided some considerable time before the transfer is to take place- especial ly in view of the fact that he may well have to send for his diploma from ifingland. ( ) The diplomas of I.M.D. personnel are, I am informed, kept by the Director General Medical Services in India &amp; it -iould seem advisable when a Jub. Asst. Gurgeon is posted to Kast Persia, that hie Diploma be sent to me direct, as e&amp;rly as possible, or a copy certified by the Persian Consul General in India. Exactly how rule (2) is to be co^lied with is difficult to see-if a photophoto b« attached Fit D«lhi or S1rala» it vdll have to be obtained from the S. Asst, ^irreor concerned ft the Consul General my require to see him to satisfy him self that he is the correct person-perhaps however, he nai^ht accept a certificate from the Director I.M. S to that effect* If, on the other hand, the photo be attached here, the local authorities, who are adept at raising difficulties, my declare that they have no means of knowing whether the diploma really belongs to the person whose photo is produced. In this esse also it uai ;ht perhaps be arranged that they should accept a Consular officer’s certificate to that effect. (3) The certificate proving practice for at least five years could presumbly be given in every case by the Director litf. 3. ftbe certified by the Persian Consul General in India ft be forwarded to me. (4) Two copies ft two translations of documents could be prepared here ft sent to Tehran. (5) The original ft copy of Permit of Residence in cases in which such are available could be supplied here. A point for consideration in this connection is that the personnel of Consulates are exempt from obtaining ’permits de sejour* - presumably a certificate from the local Governor that they have been Xuly registered, would suffice. (6) Two small photos could be prepared here, bat as one will be required under &lt;Sule (l) - if this be called for by the Director I. . for attachment to the Diplomg three copies might be obtained «t the same time ft the two spare forwarded to me with the Diploma, or copy.# 4. # In addition to the ahoTe formalities the following cb«.r^e8 will hare to he met:- (a) Annual tax of To men e 200 for a doctor Sc T» 100 for a diapenser. (h) A payment of Tomane 200 for a doctor &amp; Ts 100 for a dispenser to obtain a license to practice. (c) A fee of Rials 132 for certifying copies &amp; translations. fbre will also presumably be fees levied by the Persian Consul General in India. It is not quite clear whether fee (a) T^ould be payable by a Consulate Radical ! fticer who confines himself to treating the Consular Staff &amp; working in the Charity Dispensary, but it seems certain that it would be payable if he desires private practice. The question of the incidence of these taxes needs consideration. If they be payable even in the case of a doctor who treats the staff only &amp; works in the Dispensary, it would seem that the charges should, in justice, be borne by Government, &amp; I imagine that fees (b) &amp; (c) will, in any case be deemed a proper charge to Covemiient. If medical officers be exetopt from tax (a) provided they do not seek private practice, then, in cases in which private practice is desired, the cost of (a) might be defrayed from the iiicome derived from such practice. I fear hov^ver, that this would have still further effect in discouraging medical personnel from willingly serving in Persia. Incone from private practice in posts in Bast Persia is ' negligible Sc this, comoined with the total lackof aiatnitlea at places such as £&amp;bul, Zahidan A BirjaPd has already had a tendency to make these posts un attract ire • In theory an officer must remain at such a post, as long as required by GoTernmemt. In practice, as the Gofernraent of India sill realise, officers are apt to endeavour to obtain a transfer on various grounds, or to apply for leave sooner than sould otherwise be the case, in order to escape from such uncongenial &amp; unremunerative appointments. J*requent transfers are very expensive to Government and, particularly in the case of the Medical Officer &amp;abul, sho is also Vice-Consul, most inconvenient from an administrative point of view. Under these circumstances I would strongly recomaend that all the expenses connected with medical practice in Persia ( as outlined in this despatch) be borne by Government. The charges are all due to service in this country &amp; would not have to be mt by the Officers concerned in any post in India. The Persian Law has, of course, been framed with a view not only of regulating medical practice, but apparently in order to discourage foreign doctors from coveting with Persians. In such a place as aabul however, where the P era lane have no doctor at all k their officials as well as the public are able to obtain treatment free at the Dispensary, or on payment of a purely nominal fee when they call the Medical officer to their homes, the i^&gt;o- eition of such taxes seems somewhat unreasonable k perhaps it might be deemed possible to make some exception in thie case. The fee of Tomans 200 for a license would presumably entitle a doctor to practice for life in Persia. Incase of our officers eho come for abort periods only to this country &amp; practice only in remote locali ties where Persian Doctors are disinclined to practice at all, the fee would seem to be out of proportion. A. copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His ■Majesty*s Minister Tehran (lindorseroent Ho.31) with particular regard to paragraphs marked * which dis close points which appear to need elucidation or consideration.

September 27, 1933. M.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [E 5743/5743/34] No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 27.) (No. 435.) Sir, Gulhek, September 7, 1933. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a newspaper account of some trenchant remarks addressed by the Shah to the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, at the recent opening of a military hospital, on the subject of the supply of hospitals and doctors. 2 . The criticisms made by His Imperial Majesty are fully justified, but in view of the preponderating influence which he has himself exercised over every phase of Persian administration for so many years, it was perhaps a little unfair to address them to the unhappy Under-Secretary. I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Press Report of Criticisms by the Shah on Public Health Administration. WHEN opening the new army hospital, His Imperial Majesty the Shah addressed the Under-Secretary of Interior to the following effect:— “ This is a hospital established by the army for the army. What have you done for the public health? Is there a hospital established for that purpose? For many years I have heard that the Department of Public Health is establishing a hospital. Where is it? By now you could have organised a hospital of at least 300 beds if you could not manage the contemplated one of 1,000 beds. What is the Department of Public Health for ? If for the public benefit, what steps have you taken ? “ You will perhaps plead that your funds are insufficient. This is a mere pretext. You should at least serve the public within the scope of your small budget. On what is it spent ? “ You think I am unaware of public health conditions. People suffer for lack of drugs and doctors. I have seen sad statistics of deaths, and you spend the budget of the public health in Tehran for literary men and poets. “ The country needs men and a healthy population, and the Public Health Department has failed in its duty in this respect. “ If this department continues as at present, I will cancel its budget and open the military hospitals to the public. “ You must serve the people, look after their health, and put an end to negligence and procrastination.” [915 dd—4]</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000025_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3481</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000025</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3481</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/77 ‘Persia.
