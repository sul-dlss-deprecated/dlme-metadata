In the name oi God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To ll.M. the Suzerain Sultan, the Great King Sa'id bin Taimur. After Compliments. Your loving friend thanks his Lord, the Almighty God, for His great favours and blessings, and has nothing to report. On the 12th day of our current month a messenger arrived at our end with a letter from Saiyid Sa’ud from Sur, in which was enclosed your esteemed letter containing permission for an interview. We are pleased with this. We pray to God to bring us together, in the advantage of the Nation. Our belief , after God, in you is favourable. We sent a message to ^&gt;aiyid Sa'ud, informing him that we would God willing meet him at Quriyat on the 20th instant ( 26th October 1937) as desired by you. The messenger returned yesterday in the afternoon and said that Saiyid Sa*ud was prepared to meet us. We pray to God for good luck and facility. This messenger we are sending for your information. Please give our salaams to all esteemed Saiyids. Written as dictated by his father by your servant Mohammad.Confidential* f i J Vi y Tronelation of a letter doted the 3rd November 1937, from K.S. Soiyid Muhammad So , id to the Political Agent, Muscat* After compliments. Most respectfully 1 submit to you the news prevalent among the Omani people of Shaikh , Isa* Being a servant of your government since long I like to report such news to you, but they ore strictly confidential and I request that you will treat them os such* 1* These people stated that Soiyid So*id (Sultan) has since four months been communicating with Shaikh # Isa and Suloiman bin Himyar ar-Riyomi, asking them to come down to Muscat to discuss a new Treaty for reconcilement and decision of any pending affairs* They further stated that the Sultan was complaining of your interference in the Affairs of his State to the extent of insult, and bringing pressure to bear upon him in furthering your heavy demands* Against this attitude he found himself defenceless* He, therefore, wished to come to some sort of alliance with the Omani people to strengthen his position against such heavy demands of the Government^ statesmen* 2* Shaikh *Iso visited Qast- ol-*Alam and discuss* ions took place between him and the Sultan. The Sultan asked Shaikh # Isa to recognize him as Ruler of Muscat and Oman, and offered to him that their policy should be one and the same in prosperity and in adversity. Shaikh f Isa replied that the Omanis could not recognize this to the Sultan unless they saw his justice. Further, that they could not abandon their Imam Muhammad bin ’Abdullah al-Khalili as long as he was alive, and they would not agree to surrender to him the provinces which they/ri o they captured from Sultan Faisal* 3* • The Sultan then turned to the subject of the arms traffic: He said to Shaikh # Isa that the British Government have censed to give him the annual cheque (indemnity) due to him on account of prohibiting the import of firearms to Muscat* He asked Shaikh 'Isa what was his opinion in this respect* Shaikh # Isa replied that some years ago the Omanis received a letter from a foreign Arms Manufacturing Company, asking that the arms traffic may be resumed between them and Oman in particular* As the Omanis, however, hod no sea-port then, they could not give a satisfactory reply. The Sultan then said that there were some obligations which made the importation of firearms into Muscat impossible, but that he hoped to achieve this desire through Oman and the Omanis. At this point discussions were deferred for two months/; the Sultan to consult his father Saiyid Taimur, and Shaikh f Isa to consult the Imam and Suleiman bin Himyar* ^- The Statesmen of the British Government should be careful, as the matter shall have serious consequences and weigh heavily on the Empire. The Sultan is indifferent because of the advises of Duli Chand and his gang. &gt;• Thc Sultan offered to take Salih son of Shaikh f Isa with him to India and the father agreed. Shaikh # Isa returned successful in so far as the achievement of what he wanted from the Sultan was concerned. This is a violation of your relations with both the Omanis and the Muscat State.True copy. A.C.

Abdullahiheikh Copy of a letter from H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat to ohe Isa bin Saleh al Harthi, Muscat, dated the 28th February 1940. Thank you very much for your letter announcing your arrival. I hope you did not suffer too much inconvenience from the journey. I trust that your health will benefit from your visit to Muscat. If there is anything I can do for you please let me know. Such medical facilities as we have are at your disposal. If your health permits perhaps you will take coffee with me on a convenient date. May God preserve you and your sons. J &gt; •Sheikh Isa bin Saleh called to see me today. He ' ^ was accompanied by his three sons, Mohammad Saleh and Ibrahim, his son-in-law, Hamed bin Suleiman al Harthi, and ten followers. The usual conversation appropriate to a formal call was indulged in. After sweets and coffee had been passed round Sheikh Isa dismissed his followers and asked me if I would v/rite to the Muscat Government and ask them to permit him to go to Bahrain. He explained that he was not well and had little faith in Dr. V/.'vV. Thoms whose reputation he had heard was not good. He v/ished to see Dr. Dame or Dr. Storm. I told him Dr. Thoms was, I understood, an excellent physician and advised him to let nim examine rim. As regards his Journey to Bahrain I explained that that was a subject that he should discuss v/ith the Sultan's representative. If the Sultan's representative raised no objection I would do what I could to facilitate his Journey but I would not write any letter to Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal on the subject. Sheikh Isa smiled and said that he would discuss the m^ter with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal and let me know the result of his conversation. Sheikh Isa ia a man of sixty eight years of age according to his own statement. Moderately tall with a white beard and eyebrows he carries himself well in spite of his years. He has considerable personality and a sense of humour. Sheikh Mohammad bin Isa, the old Sheikh's right hand man, is a middle aged man with spectacles. ne gave me the feel ing that he was inclined to be unfriendly. He should be care- fuHy watched. Sheikh i^aleh is a black bearded young man not vLvy clever but,I think, straight forward. Sheikh Ibrahim bin Isa is a beardless youth or nearly so, heavy and dull in appearance. T ho Copy.of an extract from a note on an interview between oaptain T.llickinbotham, P.A. , Muscat and Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Sultan's representative, Muscat on 2/3/40. I described the correspondence v/hich led to my interview with Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and what he had said to me in private. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh will bx not be permitted to go to Bahrain, so Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal informed me, until such time as His Highness returns.'K /J7.
