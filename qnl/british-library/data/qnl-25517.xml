From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to my telegrams* Nos. 1459 and 1480, dated the 23rd and 26th ♦ Serial Nos. 160 and 163. August 1913, in regard to the death of Mr. A. Wood, the Light-house Mechanic No. 373, dated the 29th August 1913. at Little Quoin and his replacement, I ,, . . . , have the honour to forward herewith, for t e information of the Government of India, a copy of the communication mar ginally noted received from Mr. Homer in this connection. 0 Enclosnre of Serial No. 180. No. 373, dated the 20th August 1913. From—Mr. C. J. Homer, Officer in Charge Persian Gulf Light-house Works, Little Quoin, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to my telegram No. 368, dated 17th August 1913, I have the honour to report that on the morning of the 12th instant, the day after your visit to this Island, Mr. Wood mentioned to me while we were on the works to gether that he was not feeling very well. I told him to go to his quarters and lie up and sent the Sub-Assistant Surgeon to see him. The latter reported that Mr. Wood had slight fever and had been given the necessary treatment. These slight attacks of fever continued, on and off, till the 14th but on the 15th he had no fever at all and was feeling so fit that he expressed a desire to resume his duties, but was not of course, allowed to do so. On the afternoon of the 16th he sent for me and said he was feeling very hot and that his skin was very dry. I sent for the Sub-Assistant Surgeon who took his temperature and finding it to be 103°, immediately gave him some medicine to bring down the fever. His temperature, however, continued to rise and he was delirious by 9 p.m. and unconscious by 10 p.m. with the alarming temperature of 105°. His breathing was quick and laboured accompanied with a rattling sound in the throat and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon stated that his condition was most critical. We had him placed under a punkah and by repeated applications of wet cloths to his extremities succeeded in bringing his temperature down to normal by about 6 o'clock the following morning. He then became conscious and was given a diaphoretic which he did not retain. He was also given nourishment (essence of mutton, etc.) in small quantities every hour. His temperature began to rise again when the wet cloths were removed and attained 104° by about 10 a.m. when we had to resort once more to the wet applications to keep his temperature down. Although he never ^lapsed into unconsciousness again, he was not able to speak articulately only producing meaningless sounds when he had anything to say. I was in despair about him especially as I was not expecting the Elephanta back till the 18th instant. From early dawn on the 17th I had a distress signal flying from my masthead in the hope of attracting the attention of some passing vessel, but none passed and my relief was great, therefore, when I saw the Ele- phcmta coming up in the afternoon with loaded dhows in tow. She arrived off the Island by 4 p.m. and afer the dhows had been moored I had Mr. Wood con veyed on board and sent him off to the Masqat Hospital. I wrote at the same time to the Principal Medical Officer at Masqat giving him full particulars with request to treat Mr. Wood in hospital and asked him to send all charges for treatment to you. s 1I am of opinion that Mr. Wood’s illness was caused by the intense heat we have been having here and was probably an attack of heat appoplexy. I consider that Mr. Wood should be sent home as soon as he is fit to travel and I shall be glad if you will approve of this and arrange for his return passage. I am not in need of the services of another Mechanic to replace Mr. Wood, but I shall be deeply grateful if you could arrange to have fully qualified and experienced Upper Subordinate or a junior Assistant Engineer sent here soon, to assist me. The workmen sent to me from India are difficult to manage ; the work, which is spread all over the Island, is of a difficult and hazardous nature; the climate is as bad as it can be, and the only help I have at present is from a native subordinate of the standing of a “ Temporary Works Subordinate” who though hardworking and willing enough, has no control over the workmen and is a man I cannot place any responsibility on. At the time I asked* for the services of Mr. Gur Narayan, Supervisor, Public Works Department, from Burma, I believe he was employed on important light-house work. All light-house work has to close down, however, during the south-west monsoon, from the beginning of May to the end of October, and Mr. Gur Narayan’s services ought therefore to be avail able now. I shall be glad if he can be applied for again as he has been trained under me and I know I can rely on him fully. If his services cannot be obtained I trust someone else will be deputed early, who will be of real assistance to me. I shall have to visit Tanb Island periodically when the permanent buildings for keepers, etc., are being erected there. I have also to see to the work at Abadan very soon. The work on this Island will go on probably to the end of January 1914 owing to the delay in sending out the light-house fittings, and I feel sure that without the assistance I ask for the work will suffer and the loss to Government for want of adequate supervision of labour will not be inconsiderable. * Serial Nos. 211 and 236-B., in Part I, and Serial No. 15 in current correspondence.

Burma Government cannot spare Gaur Narayan’s services this year. Government of India would be glad if you could depute a man for the purpose.

Please wire what arrangements can be made, with particulars as to pay, etc., if candidate obtainable.3 Telegram No. 1605, dated the 19th (received 20th) September 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. Following telegram received from Homer in reply to your proposal to withdraw Mephanta. Begins. Impossible continue work on Quoin without the whole-time services of steam tender. If this cannot be granted request that work on Quoin be shut down. Ends. I am acquainted with conditions of work at present and entirely agree. Homer has not only got critical work proceeding at Quoin but has to look after construction work on Tanb. It is not possible to deprive him of services of tender without risk to community at Little Quoin and without serious prejudice and delay to light-house work. None of armed launches will serve the pur pose dur mg weather prevailing from November onwards and if you cannot spare Mephanta I must press for supply of some effective substitute.

I am informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a light-house is being erected by the Government of India on Tamb Island, and he represents that the ownership of this island by the Shaikh of Shargah is contested by the Persian Government. From the correspondence in the archives I see that when in 1905-06 the question was raised here, it would seem to have been shelved after your visit to the island and your disproval of the statement that buildings were in course of erection there. I should be glad of your views on the subject. I am informed that you have been in communication with the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Telegram P., No. 88—325, dated the 23rd February 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Your Excellency’s telegram No. 65. Owing to my absence reply has been delayed. Please see paragraph 3 of my letter No. 2575, dated 13th October 1912, to the Government of India (enclosure to my despatch No. 69) for nature of my conversation with the Governor. He mentioned to me more recently in private conversation that he would have to make a reference on the subject to Tehran. 1 answered that that was his affair, but that the ownership of Tamb was not open to question as far as I was concerned.2 I would also invite reference to my letter No. 3314, dated 13th December, to the Government of India regarding the light-house (forming enclosure to my despatch to you, No. 95 of same date). Since the correspondence of ]905 the subjects of the Shaikh of Shargah and his flag have remained established on the island undisturbed, and I would strongly urge that we should decline to re-open the question of owner ship now. No doubt if we did, we should revive the question of Sirri {vide warn in referred to in Sir A. Hardinge’s despatch No. Ill dated 20th July lyOl, to Bis Majesty’s Foreign Office). I venture, however, to think that a flat refusal to re-open the question would best meet the case now. It 0 now five months since the light-house was landed on the island, and for tne past five weeks our engineer has been engaged in its erection.

Minister for Foreign Affairs has submitted memorandum which he says contains the utmost he has been able to get the Cabinet to accept. Following is a summary. ° ‘‘ (1) Persian Government is disposed to cause light-houses to be built and buoys to be placed on or in neighbourhood of certain Persian islands to be determined upon later in agreement with the British Government on the following conditions : Firstly, British engineers shall be engaged by, Persia to carry ^ out construction of light-houses. Secondly, on completkm of the construction the working and maintenance of the apparatus will be entrusted to British employes specially engaged for the purpose. Thirdly, should the Persian Government retire funds to meet expenses k&gt; be incurred His Majesty’s ^Government vHll be asked to make the necessary advance. Fourthly, interest and amortization of such advance will be met by tolls leviable from shipping. I ratVer gather vagueness ©f detail is intentional in order to leave us a free hand without appearing to do so. I said I would submit scheme, but I held out no hope of it being found acceptable. I am repeating second part of above to Bushire.’ ” Cabinet will not enter into any negotiations connected with policing and demand that other points raised in yonr telegram 37 as modified by Government of India telegram 50 C. repented to me in your telegram No. 46 shall stand orer until a Medjliss is assembled.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Delhi. Please refer to my telegram No. 453 of to-day. As the matter seems unlikely to be achieved by friendly negotiations and as the attitude of the Persian Government is entirely unsatisfactory, I trust that Government will consider expediency of avoiding further delay by reverting to one of the alter native schemes which do not involve reference to Persian Government.-A Ill No. 1325—1 M., dated Delhi, the 20th—21st February 1913. From The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department, To—The Director of the Royal Indian Marine. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 907, dated the 11th February 1913, in which you propose that the Director of the Royal Indian Marine should be authorised to pay visits of inspection to the Persian Gulf, whenever he considers it necessary to do so in connection with the lights and buoys that are being established in that locality and when he can arrange with the Political Resident for the loan of the Persian Gulf despatch vessel or the light-house tender, when the latter is built. 2. In reply, I am to say that the Government of India sanction the pro posal, the expenditure involved in each case being debited to the Royal Indian Marine estimates. 3. I am to add that intimation should he sent to the Government of India whenever the Director of the Royal Indian Marine proposes to pay visits of inspection to the Persian Gulf. r No. 907, dated Bomhay/the lTth February 1913. From—The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. I have the honour to bring to your notice that the recently approved and partially installed scheme of lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf has involved the Director of the Royal Indian Marine in a large amount of details, interest, and responsibility in that portion of what may now be termed Indian Waters (though according to ruling contained in Appendix XXII, para- o-raph 70, Rule 3, Marine Regulations, India, Volume I, Part I, page 261, it fs outside the Indian limit), and it is desirable that the Director should have as intimate a knowledge as possible of the localities and conditions that prevail in and about the various places where light vessels, houses and buoys are to be located. It is also in the interests of the scheme that he should be as much in touch with Sir P. Z. Cox (the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) as possible, as, from the nature of the scheme and the political situation on which it hinges, the administration and control of the lighting scheme must of necessity be one of a dual nature between the Resident and the Director. I, therefore, have the honour to propose that the Persian Gulf in general should from the present date be considered as a touring area for the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who should pay occasional visits there, at times when his other various and numerous responsibilities allow him to do so, and when he can arrange with the Resident for the loan of the Persian Gulf despatch vessel or light-house tender w~hen it is built. With a view to obtaining a personal acquaintance with this district and a personal discussion on the whole matter with Sir P. Z. Cox, I have, in anti cipation of approval of the Government of India, arranged with that officer for the loan of the R.I.M S. “ Lawrence ” during the month of March to visit the places on the annexed programme, on or about the dates tabulated.V 114 Telegram, No. 21—47 T., dated the 25th February 1913.

I you will warn your representative on the Island to sho*v civility and give any help he can on your behalf. It is necessary to mention that I called at Tanb during my last voyage and interviewed the Custodian of your flag. It is true that he did possess your flag but he had no rope to hoist it with. I told him to ask you for some, but he may not have done so. I have so often warned you of the importance of keeping your flag flying, but you do not give heed ; now, at all events this Island will be preserved for you by the mere presence of the lighthouse, so you will have no anxiety • still it is always advisable for your own good name and the dignity of the Jowasj®, that you keep your flag in order, and fly it when ships pass. 1 beg that you will acknowledge receipt of this letter.

'! ni ^ llrected t0 acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 30th ultimo (No. P. 1838), further on the subject of the scheme for lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf. 2. In reply, I am to acquaint you, for the information of the Marquess of • Crewe, that, as requested therein, the Elder Brethren have issued instructions for the supply of the necessary plant for the lighthouses at Tamb Island and Little Quoin; and, as a result of an interview with the authorities at the Co onial Office, they believe that it will be possible to arrange for the despatch of the lighthouse tower for Tamb Island in August next for a sum of three thousand and forty pounds (3,0401.), and it is expected that the difference between this amount and that of the original estimate of five thousand pounds (5,0001), which has been already approved, will cover the cost of erecting this lighthouse ; and the exact date when it will be ready for shipment will be communicated to you in due course. 3. dhe lighthouse tower, &amp;c., for Little Quoin will follow as soon as possible, but a tender therefor will be first submitted for approval. 4. Arrangements will also be made by this Corporation for the despatch of the mechanic to the Persian Gulf to supervise and assist in the erection of the lighthouses. 5. With reference to the lightship to be constructed for Shat-el-Arab, the Elder Brethren note that the vessel is to be built in the Dockyard at Bombay, but they piesume that the India Office desire the brinity House to provide the iron mast and the lantern and lighting apparatus therefor and to have them forwarded to Bombay, and on being informed that this is so, they will pu this work in hand and furnish the necessary drawings, Ac., for the guidance of the local authorities in building the ship. 6. As regards the proposed lighthouse steamer, I am to state that since receiving your letter the Elder Brethren have had an interview with the Director of the Royal Indian Marine on the subject. At his request the Director has been afforded facilities for inspecting one oi‘ the Trinity House steamers of the type which (with certain modifications to meet local require ments) the Elder Brethren had in mind as being suitable for the Persian Gulf, and he has also been furnished with a copy of the plans and specifica tions of the ship, and the Board therefore propose to await a further com munication from the India Office before taking any other steps in this matter. 7. On being informed of the shape and size of the unlighted buoys proposed to be constructed at Bombay, the Elder Brethren will be happy to forward detailed drawings therefor.8. With reference to the enquiry contained in the final paragraph of your letter, 1 am to state that the original estimates included the cost of super vision by resident inspectors, but did not include departmental charges and professional fees which would be on the same basis (viz., 2-|- per cent, departmental expenses and per cent, professional fees) as the charges under existing arrangements for similar work executed from time to time through the Trinity House for the India Office, and, in the case of the proposed steamer, there would be a further charge for the preparation of drawings, visits of inspection to the Contractors’ works by the technical staff, and professional, &amp;c., fees, which it is estimated would amount in all to some four hundred (400Z.) to five hundred pounds (500Z.), and is not included in the estimate of thirty thousand pounds (30,000Z.). 9. In conclusion I am to add that the estimates of cost of the various works, as already approved, will be adhered to as rigidly as possible. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State H. G.

J . At Tamb Island, the dioptric apparatus to be of the third order, the intensity of the light being 100,000 candles, and the range of visibility 20 miles. J At Sheikh Shuaib Island, the dioptric apparatus to be of the third order, the intensity of the light being 100,000 candles, and- the range of visibility 17 miles. The Elder Brethren suggest that the lighthouses for Little Quoin, Tamb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island be constructed of open iron frame work, the upper portion being enclosed to act as a service or watch-room. The structure to be surmounted by a lantern of the usual type adopted in the Trinity House service. The lighthouses to be constructed in England from designs to be prepared at this House, the lantern, dioptric apparatus, burners, &amp;c., being fitted and tested before shipment. «_&gt;. It is suggested that the foundations for receiving the structures should be designed and constructed by the local authorities, the necessary information in connection therewith being supplied by the Trinity House, also that the quarters for the keepers, landing places, roads, access from landings to sites, water storage tanks, &amp;c., be designed and constructed by the local authorities, wffio are best acquainted with the nature of the requirements. 4. The Elder Brethren propose that a competent mechanic be sent from England to the Persian Gulf to take charge of the erection of the towers from the foundation level and bring the lights into action, all necessary assistance, plant, labour, hoisting tackle, &amp;c., being supplied by the local authorities. 5. The cost of the work to be supplied from England, including freight to the Persian Gulf, is estimated to be as follows:— Little Quoin, 7,000L Tamb Island, 5,000L Sheikh Shuaib Island, 6,000Z. ) ) including mechanic from England for erection of same. Light Vessel. 6. With reference to the establishment of a light vessel at Shatt-al-Arab, four or five miles to seaward of the existing British outer bar buoy,',,the Elder Brethren now suggest that the light be on the incandescent system, S. 146. Aconsuming oil, instead of the illuminant being oil-gas as originally proposed. It is recommended that the vessel be built in England, and when completed placed on a station for trial and adjustment before being despatched to the Gulf, to which she could he towed by the lighthouse tender which it is proposed to construct. The cost of the vessel is estimated at 9,500L, including delivery to its destination, but the Elder Brethren desire to point out that this figure is liable to variation in consequence of the frequent and considerable changes which take place in the cost of shipbuilding. The intensity of the light would be 40,000 candles, and the range of visibility eleven miles. Buoys, Lighted. 7. Either oil gas or acetylene would be suitable illuminants for the pro posed lighted buoys, but in view of the fact that the number of buoys required at stations is only six, the expenditure which would be involved in establishing oil-gas producing plant, and fitting the lighthouse tender with transport receivers, gas compressing pumps. &amp;c., would, in the opinion of the Elder Brethren, hardly be justified, and they accordingly recommend that the six buoys be of the same type as the acetylene lighted buoy already established at Shatt-al-Arab, which was constructed by the Inter national Marine Signal Company, and is known as No. 8 C. The buoys complete, with lanterns and moorings, should be supplied from England, the estimated cost, including freight to the Gulf, being 600b each. Two buoys of this type are ready, and arrangements have been made with the manu facturers to hold these at the disposal of the Elder Brethren for a few days, and on hearing that the India Office wish them to be supplied they could be despatched at once. The remainder could probably be completed in ten to twelve weeks from date of order. Buoys, Unlit. 8. Three buoys of this type are included in the list, with top-marks and moorings complete, viz. :— Jask - , - - - 5th class conical buoy. Bunder Abbas - - 2nd class can buoy. Bahrein - - - - 5th class conical buoy. In regard to this proposal I am to state that the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a 5th class buoy is too small for a position of the importance of Jask, and they consider that a 2nd class buoy would be more suitable which would increase the cost of this part of the scheme by 100b It is suggested that the buoys and moorings complete should be supplied from England, their cost including freight to the Gulf would be as follows:—Jask (2nd class) 200b, Bunder Abbas 200b, Bahrein. 100b Lighthouse Tender. 9. In the third paragraph of the India Office letter, dated the 2nd March, the hope is expressed by Lord Crewe that a reduction may be made in the original estimate of the cost of the lighthouse tender, viz., 30,000b Accom panying the papers, however, is a letter from the Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 31st January last, stating the approximate dimensions to which the Royal Indian Marine Committee desire the vessel to be built. The estimate of 30,000b is based on the cost of steam vessels constructed for the Trinity House service. There are certain parts in connection with these vessels which would not be necessary in a tender for the Persian Gulf, whilst, on the other hand, the latter might require various fittings for the convenience of the officers and crew which are not necessary in this service.

It would be necessary to send from England for the depot the snare buoys moorings, and 10-ton travelling crane. All corrugated iron buildiLs rails, hand cranes, trolleys, workshop equipment, &amp;c., could, it is understood’ be obtained at Bombay. 14. With regard to the date for completion, bearing in mind that the various works to be supplied from England would be undertaken by various contractors, the whole of the buoys could be shipped in four months, and the three lighthouses and the Light Vessel in nine months from the' date of order. 15. A statement is forwarded herewith showing the works it is suggested should be supplied from this country, with estimated cost and other particulars. S. 146. A 21G. As the work is understood to be urgent, much progress could be made at once by the local authorities in the preparation of the concrete foun dations of the towers, construction of the landing places, keepers’ dwellings, roads, &amp;c., during which time the iron towers could be under construction in England. 17. In this connection I am to state that the Elder Brethren have at the present time under construction for the Colonial Office an iron tower and third order single flashing light which would be suitable for Tamb Island, and if the matter is very urgent the Elder Brethren would be disposed, if the Marquess of Crewe considers it desirable, to approach the Colonial Office on the subject with a view to the tower and apparatus referred to being utilised for Tamb Island, and the Colonial Office work delayed to some extent. If this were done the material for Tamb Island could be shipped in August. 18. The drawings of the concrete foundations for the three towers will be ready for despatch to the India Office in time for next week’s mail to India. 19. The time for the manufacture of the work for all the lights is based on the ordinary routine of business; but, should the India Office require quicker delivery, no doubt this would be possible if a premium were paid to the various contractors. 20. If it is still desired to hold a Conference on the subject of acquiring a site on Abadan Island for a lighthouse depot, the Elder Brethren will be glad to arrange for a member of this Board, together with their Engineer-in- Chief and Mr. Hood, to attend.

My Lord, In the teiegram of four Excellency’s Govern ment, dated the 27th April 1911, attention was drawn to the fact that it would be necessary to approach the Persian Government in connection with the proposal to place a lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaib Island. I enclose, for your information, copy of correspondence- with His Majesty’s Minister at 1 email upon the subject, and request that 1 may receive your observations by telegraph on the Memorandum handed to Sir G. Barclay on the 8th h ebiuaiy last, and in particular on the effect, if any, upon oui position locally, if we appear to be acting as the delegate of Persia and no longer on our own account as the Power which has hitherto made itself responsible for the safe navigation of the Gulf. 2. It is also for consideration whether, in replying to the Persian Memorandum, any mention should be made of other items m the scheme (copy enclosed), such as the fact that it is proposed to lay buoys at Jask (item No. 1 in the List), Bunder Abbas (Nos. 3 and 4), and Bushire (Nos. 7 and 8); and, as regards the lighthouses at Musandam (No. 2j, and Iamb Island (No. 5), and the buoys at Bahrein (Nos. 11-13), I should be glad to learn whether you contemplate obtaining any formal authority, either now or later, from the local Chiefs for the establishment of lights and buoys, and for the levy of light dues at some future time if thought desirable. The position as regards dues will become clearer, vis-a-vis of Turkey, if negotiations which are about to be begun on the basis of the British Memorandum of the 29th July last (extract enclosed), should be successfully concluded. The extract, so far as it relates to the Shatt-al-Arab, covers the case of the light vessel (item No. 9) and the lighted buoy (No. 10), which it is proposed to establish in that locality. 3. As Your Excellency is aware from the papers forwarded in recent letters from the Secretary,Political Department of this Office, correspondence is proceeding separately on the question of the plant required for the provision of the lights and buoys. 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, hour Lordship s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Crewe.ENCLOSURES.

Barclay to Sir E. Grey. No. 28 (Secret). Tehran, gj r&lt; 9th February 1912. With reference to my Despatch No. 210, of 31st October last, I have the honour to report that on the disappearance of the Mejliss I thought the moment a favourable one for approaching the Persian Government in regard to the lighthouse on the island of Sheikh Shuaib, and on the 17th ultimo 1 mentioned the scheme to the Minister for Foreign Affairs requesting the Persian Government to authorise Sheikh Ahmad Hamadi of Mugam, the Chieftain of the Island, to grant the site for the lighthouse. Plis Excellency promised to consult his colleagues in the Cabinet and to give me an answer shortly. On the 31st ultimo I enquired as to the decision of the Persian Government, and Plis Excellency replied that no definite decision had been taken, but that he thought that there would be no difficulty about the lighthouse provided it were constructed and worked by Persia. I pointed out that this was not what w r as desired. The buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf had for many years been in British hands, and it would be undesirable to make an exception in the case of the lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaib, besides which if the lighthouse were worked by the Persian Government which had no experience of such matters there could be no guarantee that it would be efficiently done. His Excellency appeared to be under the impression that the cost of the erection of the lighthouse would be 4,000b, and I therefore told him that we estimated the initial cost at 8,000b and the running expenses at 400b a year. His Excellency took note of what I said, and promised to1 give a definite answer in a few days. He added that in any case the lighthouse would have to fly the Persian flag, and I told 'him that personally 1 thought there would be no objection to this. Yesterday I received a visit from the Chef de Cabinet of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who handed me the accompanying memo randum of the terms on which the Persian Government were prepared to consent to the construction of the lighthouse. I do not know how far His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to accept these terms. I explained to Moin el Vezareh, the Chef de Cabinet, that the question of light dues in the Persian Gulf was a large one and had not yet been considered. It would, I presume, be difficult to levy separate dues for one particular lighthouse, and should His Majesty’s Government consent to the Persian Government’s bearing the cost of the construction and running of the lighthouse, some arrangement would have to be made whereby a certain proportion of the total dues eventually collected in the Gulf would be paid to the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c., The Right Hon. G. Barclay. Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Memorandum. 1. The Persian Government authorises the erection, at their own cost, of a lighthouse on the coast of Sheikh Shuaib Island, for the convenience of navigation in the Gulf. 2. Prior to the work being put in hand, the contractors will submit to the Persian Government the rough estimate of the outlay (the Cahier des Charges) and the plan of the structure. 3. The upkeep and superintendence of the lighthouse, as well as the working of the apparatus, is temporarily delegated by the Persian Government for convenience sake to the Anglo-Indian naval officers. 4. The cost of such maintenance will be borne by the Persian Government, who will be previously furnished with an approximate statement of the annual expense. 5. The Anglo-Indian naval officers will be requested to collect the tolls (beaconage) on behalf of the Persian Government, and keep the accounts. 6. In each year, two months after the 1st of Hamal (21st of March), a statement of accounts showing the receipts and expenses of the previous year will be handed to the Persian Government. 7. The receipts will serve to cover the expenses of administration and will, moreover, constitute a sinking fund for the capital expended in building the lighthouse. 8. The regulations concerning the working of the lighthouse, the manner in which the tolls will be collected, and the amount of such dues, will be submitted to the Persian Government, who will have the right of inspection. 9. The Persian flag will permanently fly over the lighthouse.a '-S3»-4A &lt; /» | w zmm Enclosure No. 6. Extract from British Memorandum to Turkish Government 29th July 1911. ‘‘Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the bhatt-al-Arab. For a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over 50 years t e ^ ork of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out ^by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. ^ t ! lese circumstances His Majesty’s Government have some dimculty m appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they woum propose to^ the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission, comprised of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. u As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the Turkish Government, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b) to police its waters ; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements.”CONFIDENTIAL AND IMME DIATE. P. 642. Sir, India Office, 2nd March 1912. contmu ation of the lettea from this Office, dated the 27th February 1912, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state, for the confidential information of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, ? that as a result of correspondence with die Foreign Office, the Admiralty’ and the Treasury, it has now been decided, subject only to the assent of the last-named Department in respect of the light-vessel for the Shatt-al- Arab, to provide and maintain in the Persian Gulf the lights and buoys set out in the list enclosed. 2. In reply to an inquiry by the Secretary of State as to the plant to be ordered from this country, the Government of India have suggested in a telegram, dated the 9th February, that Mr. D. W. Hood should be asked to advise, since no definite information is in their own possession as to the designs and requirements of the several lights and buoys beyond what is contained in Mr. Hood’s Report. The Marquess of Crewe would be greatly obliged if this suggestion could be acted on, and a statement be prepared for transmission to the Government of India showing in the case of each item oi the list, whether lighthouse, light-vessel, or lighted or unlit buoy, what plant it would seem best to procure and send out from England. 3. In addition to the lights and buoys, the questions of a lighthouse tender and of a depot, have also been considered. It has been found impracticable to adapt as a tender any existing vessel, and, subject to further consideration when an accurate estimate has been framed, the Government of India have recommended the construction of a separate tender, for which, it is under stood, the Director of the Royal Indian Marine is now preparing an estimate. The estimate of Mr. Hood was, it will be remembered, 30,000b for initial, and 5,000b for annual recurring expenditure, but Lord Crewe proposes to draw attention to the desirability of effecting a reduction in these figures, and meanwhile he would be glad to learn, for the assistance of the Govern ment of India in preparing their estimate, on what data Mr. Hood’s estimate was prepared, and whether, in view of the more moderate scheme that has now been decided on, the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a smaller and less expensive tender might be sufficient. 4. With regard to the lighthouse depot, I am to enquire whether the sum of 22,000b allowed for in Mr. Hood’s estimate cannot also now be substantially reduced. Both the Secretary of State and the Lords Commissioners of the t Treasury are desirous of confining the scheme to the barest requirements of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and they hope that some The Secretary to the Elder Brethren, Trinit} 7 House, E.C,— ir economy may be practicable as regards the depot. It would be convenient if a list of the plant to be stored in the depot, with estimates could also be supplied. 5. As regards the location of the depot, it has recently been suggested by the Government of India that this should be on land acquired by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company at Abadan Island, instead of at Koweit, as proposed by the Committee. A further communication will be made to you upon this subject, but it would be convenient if meanwhile particulars could be prepared, to be discussed if necessary at an informal conference, of the extent of land that would be required for the purpose, and the works to be installed. 6. I he favour is requested of an early reply, since it is proposed now to proceed with the lighting and buoyage scheme with the least possible delay. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. Ritchie. I A! I 710 From Viceroy, 2nd February 1912. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of the 19th October 1911. Tender. On our present information we can form no definite opinion as to accuracy of Hood’s estimate. Subject, however, to further consideration when accurate estimate has been framed, we recommend construction of separate tender, and Director, Royal Indian Marine, has been asked to follow procedure indicated in enclosure to paragraph 5 of Military Supply Despatch No. 18, dated 19th March 1908.\ Confidential. No. B. 1610. Trinity House, London, E.O., bir &gt; _ 8th June 1912. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 30th ultimo (No. P. 1838), further on the subject of the scheme for lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf. 2. In i eply, I am to acquaint you, for the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that, as requested therein, the Elder Brethren have issued instructions for the supply of the necessary plant for the lighthouses at Tamb Island and Little Quoin; and, as a result of an interview with the authorities at the Colonial Office, they believe that it will be possible to arrange for the despatch of the lighthouse tower for Tamb Island in August next for a sum of three thousand and forty pounds (3,0401), and it is expected that the difference between this amount and that of the original estimate of five thousand pounds (5,000L), which has been already approved, will cover the cost of erecting this lighthouse ; and the exact date when it will be ready for shipment will be communicated to you in due course. 3. The lighthouse tower, &amp;c., for Little Quoin will follow as soon as possible, but a tender therefor will be first submitted for approval. 4. Arrangements will also be made by this Corporation for the despatch of the mechanic to the Persian Gulf to supervise and assist in the erection of the lighthouses. 5. With reference to the lightship to be constructed for Shat-el-Arab, the Elder Brethren note that the vessel is to be built in the Dockyard at Bombay, but they presume that the India Office desire the Trinity House to provide the iron mast and the lantern and lighting apparatus therefor and to have them forwarded to Bombay, and on being informed that this is so, they will pu this work in hand and furnish the necessary drawings, Ac., for the guidance of the local authorities in building the ship. 6. As regards the proposed lighthouse steamer, I am to state that since receiving your letter the Elder Brethren have had an interview with the Director of the Royal Indian Marine on the subject. At his request the Director has been afforded facilities for inspecting one of the Trinity House steamers of the type which (with certain modifications to meet local require ments) the Elder Brethren had in mind as being suitable for the Persian Gulf, and he has also been furnished with a copy of the plans and specifica tions of the ship, and the Board therefore propose to await a further com munication from the India Office before taking any other steps in this matter. 7. On being informed of the shape and size of the unlighted buoys proposed to be constructed at Bombay, the Elder Brethren will be happy to forward detailed drawings therefor. S. 161.9 8. With reference to the enquiry contained in the final paragraph of your letter, I am to state that the original estimates included the cost of super vision by resident inspectors, hut did not include departmental charges and / professional fees which would be on the same basis (viz., 2J per cent. &lt; , departmental expenses and 2^ per cent, professional fees) as the charges ^ under existing arrangements for similar work executed from time to time through the Trinity House for the India Office, and, in the case of the ' proposed steamer, there would be a further charge for the preparation of drawings, visits of inspection to the Contractors’ works by the technical staff, and professional, &amp;c., fees, which it is estimated would amount in all to some four hundred (400Z.) to five hundred pounds (500L), and is not included in the estimate of thirty thousand pounds (30,000L). 9. In conclusion I am to add that the estimates of cost of the various works, as already approved, will be adhered to as rigidly as possible. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State H. G.

Intensive oil tanks, refineries, workshops, power houses, &amp;c., have already been established, and more are in contemplation. T it is understood that every facility will be offered by the Company o the Government of India for leasing the required area of land for the establishment of a lighthouse depot, and it was proposed by i r. Gieenway that the two acres suggested by the Elder Brethren as necessary for the purpose could be acquired for a term of fifty years (the duration of the Company’s lease of the property) for a small, or even nominal rental. In the letter from the Trinity House to the India Office ated 26th March 1912 (Ex. 874), it was suggested that an area of two acres would probably be necessary for the accommodation of the depot the establishment of which would involve considerable expenditure, as it’ was understood that nothing whatever was available for adaptation to lighthouse purposes, but it now appears that this is not the case. 4. As already stated, extensive workshops, largely staffed by European mechanics and fitted with modern tools, have been established, and it has ieen suggested that an agreement might possibly be arrived at between the Government of India and the Company, whereby all repairs necessary for the worang parts of lighthouses, light vessels, and gas buoys, would be executed I by the Company s engineering staff, thus rendering the establishment and equipment of lighthouse workshops unnecessary. r It was also assumed that a considerable area would be required, and expense incurred, in providing- for the storage of steam coal for the tender. This can, however, be obviated, as already suggested by the Elder Brethren by the whole or partial use of oil fuel, which can be supplied on the spot •’ but as the depot will be within a few miles of Muhammera, where a coaling station exists, no provision need be made for extensive coal storage at the depot.2 A carbide store has already been erected, presumably, as Mr. Green way suggested, in connection with the acetylene buoy already laid at the Shatt-al- Arab. It may, therefore, only be necessary to enlarge it on the establishment of additional buoys. 7 An extensive pier or wharf has already been built at, it is understood^ a cost of about 20,000b, alongside of which large steamers can lie, and from which several lines of rails for wagons and trolleys have been laid to various parts of the concession, including the area proposed for the depot, distant about half-a-mile. A small area, it is anticipated, can be acquired for the storage of spare buoys on the river bank in the immediate vicinity of the pier. $ Provision was also made in the estimates submittted by the Elder Brethren for extensive oil storage tanks. This also may be unnecessary, as Mr. Greenway stated his Gompany can supply any description of oil that may be necessary. In order that this point may be verified, however, which is a most important matter in lighthouse illumination, the following is the specification of ordinary lighthouse oil as used in the Trinity House Service, with which supplies for lighthouse purposes must conform, viz. :— f. Specific gravity to be not less than 0‘810, nor greater than O'820 at 60° Fahr. ; flashing point not lower than 145°, nor higher than 160° Fahr. ; to distil between 302° and 572° Fahr., the temperature of the vapour, not that of the liquid, being taken. /A With the above facilities so readily available, it would now appear that the establishment of a lighthouse depot at Abadan to meet the immediate requirements is a comparatively small matter, arid might be restricted to the erection of a storehouse for lighthouse stores, such as cleaning stores, mantles, spare parts, gas buoy lanterns, &amp;c., another for ropes and ship’s stores, and one for engine-room stores. A space is also required for a buoy yard and chain lockers. //. In regard to the storehouses, one building containing three storerooms and an office of two rooms, with a roomy loft overall, would, it is considered, meet the present requirements. The lighthouse store and engineer’s store room to be each about 15 feet square, and the general store about 40 feet by 15 feet. This building, together with the buoy yard and chain lockers, could, it is believed, be accommodated on a site approximately 100 feet by 50 feet, or about one-eighth of an acre, which it would perhaps be found possible to procure near the pier. Such ground as would ultimately be found necessary for dwellings, &amp;c., could be arranged for on the more remote part of the concession near the southern boundary, as proposed by Mr. Greenway, but it would be a great convenience for working if the site could be procured near the pier instead of a position distant half a mile from it. /2.Information should be obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as to whether they have on their pier a crane capable of lifting 10 tons from the deck of a vessel alongside ; and, if so, whether it is a travelling crane that could be run from the pier into the buoy yard to unload a buoy from a trolley there. It should also be ascertained from the Company what is the gauge of their tramways, and if laid and ballasted to carry heavy loads. /3.1n regard to the cost of such a depot, the Elder Brethren would suggest that as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are still carrying out works at the site, they be asked for what sum they would be prepared to erect thenecessary buildings as described in this letter, with concrete floors, lay a tramway into the depot from their pier of sufficient gauge to carry a 10-ton load, provide four chain lockers (which are usually brickwork chambers about 10 feet by 6 feet roofed with one end open), and fence in the whole area. If a 10-ton crane and trolley are not already available, they could be piovided through the Trinity House at a cost of about eight hundred pounds f.o.b. England.

[This Document is the property of His Britannia Majesty’s Government.] REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY ON THE LIGHTING AND BUOYAGE OP THE PERSIAN GULF. Members : Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. D. W. Hood, A.M.Inst.C.E., Trinity House. Commander S. Litchfield, R.N., H.M.S. “ Sphinx.” Commander W. G. Beauchamp, R.I.M., in charge of the Marine Survey of India. 1. The object of this Committee was to gather information and examine locally the general question of the proposed lighting of the Persian Gulf and improvement of the buoyage. The subjects for examination Avere to include the number of lights and buoys required, the best sites for the erection of the former, with class of light most suitable in each case, and cost of erection, maintenance, &amp;c. 2. Major Cox was unable to leave Bushire owing to the state of affairs in Persia, but the other members of the Committee, accompanied by Captain Iievor, lirst Assistant to the Political Resident, commenced their investigations at Muscat on 3rd April, \A r hen they embarked in the R.I.M.S. “Lawrence.” Major Cox was subsequently able to join in the deliberations of the Committee at Bushire and is a party to the recommendations contained in this report. 3. The Committee were furnished with a copy of the report of an Admiralty conference on this question, and previous to the conclusion of their labours had the great advantage of meeting and conferring Avith Rear-Admiral E. J. Slade, M.Y.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, who was a member of that conference. The proposals contained in that report have been carefully examined on the spot, and some modifications and additions are recommended in view of local conditions and experience. Cost has also been taken into consideration. The Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who was confidentially consulted by the Committee at Bombay, furnished suggestions for lighting the Gulf obtained from six captains of Gulf mail steamers, s. 11. A2 4. Abstract statement of the lights proposed by six officers in command of British India Steam Navigation Company s mail steamers in Persian Gulf:— Place. Proposed by Number of Officers indicated. Place. Proposed by Number of Officers indicated. Muscat 6 Shah Allum Shoal 2 Jask - - - 2 Ras al Mutaf 5 Ras al Kuh 2 Bushire 4 Musandam 6 Karag Island - 1 Bunder Abbas 1 Shatt al Arab Bar 3 Tanb Island 1 Ras al Arz 4 Lingah 1 Kubbar Island 2 Abu Musa 1 Farsi ... 1 Farur Island 2 Rennie Shoal 1 Nabiyu Farur 1 Bahrein ... 1 Kais Island 2 The above suggestions were, of necessity, rather hurriedly given, and would have been of greater value had they been put forward collectively instead of individually, and considerable divergence of opinion is apparent. The suggestions, however, include every place in the Gulf at which the establishment of a light could be reasonably entertained. Lights at Muscat, Musandam (Quoin), Bunder Abbas, Tanb, Lingah, Ras al Mutaf, Bushire, Shatt al Arab Bar, Ras al Arz, Kubbar, and Bahrein are included in the recommendations of the Committee. The lighting of Kais received special consideration, but Shaikh Shuaib is recommended in preference. Shah Allum and Rennie Shoals are undoubted dangers in the fairway of ships making for Bahrein from the east and north respectively, but the lighting of these shoals is not considered to be warranted at present. The lighting of Farsi Island will be desirable in the event of material development of trade between the north of the Gulf and Bahrein. It is not recommended at present. A light on Ras al Ivuh would be useful to navigation, but is not recommended. It would be necessary to maintain an armed guard for its protection. It is not considered that lights are required at any of the other places mentioned. Existing Lights. 5. The only lights regular]y exhibited in the Gulf at the present time are those at Koweit and Fao. The former is a fixed red light visible five miles, recently installed by the Government of India at the British Agency. The Fao lights are maintained by the Turkish authorities and are too feeble to be of much service.o O % /S,hh Tlle T Agen !, S n/ 1 ^ 6 British India Steam Navi g atio11 Company, at Bunder . bbas, Lmgah, Debai, and Koweit are in the habit of exhibiting a light on their piemises wiien their steamers are expected. His Majesty’s ships sometimes arrange with officials of the Indo-European e egraph Stations at Bushire, Henjam, and Jask for a light to be hoisted when they expect to arrive at night. Proposed Scheme. 6. A comprehensive scheme of lighting the Gulf and its approach will necessitate the establishment of lights at the following places taken in geographical order Muscat. Musandam (Quoin). Bunder Abbas. Tanb. Lingah. Shaikh Shuaib. Pas al Mutaf. 'Bushire. Shatt al Arab Bar. Koweit. Bahrein. Debai. The above list includes the lighting at all places recommended by the Admiralty Conference with certain modifications (hereinafter detailed) for Bushire, Bahrein, Koweit, and Bunder Abbas, and additional lights at Tanb Shaikh Shuaib, Ras al Mutaf, and Debai. The object m view has been to provide lights at the most important salient points and outlying dangers for general guidance in the navigation of the Gulf and at the principal ports. I he lights at Tanb, Shaikh Shuaib, and. Ras al Mutaf are considered to be very necessary. They have an incidental advantage in completing an approximately equi-distant chain of lights. Muscat. A 20-mile light on the summit of Ras Muscat, which has an elevation of 240 feet above high-water, is recommended as combining efficiency with greatest economy. This proposal is made after consideration of the followino- points :— 1. The entrance to Muscat harbour is remarkably blind,' but the coast in the vicinity is bold and free from outlying dangers. 2. The requirements of the port would be fulfilled by a low-placed light of moderate power to indicate the entrance of the harbour. 3. From a navigational point of view Fisher’s Rock offers an ideal site, but the cost of a safe structure, even for a small light, in such an exposed position would be very heavy. hhe alternative site on Ras Muscat is therefore recommended. Com pared with Fisher’s Rock a light on Ras Muscat is less favourably placed in thick weather, which, however, is not frequent, and it is cables inside the outlying danger; on the other hand it would serve the double purpose of a4 i' M ; ,/ land fall and harbour light and has this additional advantage that ships bound from the Red Sea to the Gulf would pass well within the range of the light. No political difficulty with regard to the site is anticipated at Muscat. The blue light shown on the chart of the harbour and referred to on page 41 of Gulf Pilot no longer exists. It was never very useful. Musandam (Quoin). The Little Quoin provides a practical site for a light off Musandam, and is strongly recommended in preference to Musandam Island or Kachal Island, the alternative sites considered. The Quoin is already accessible on its northern 63 nd, and landing arrangements can be made comparatively easy. Owing to the severity of the climate and scarcity of sweet water in this part of the Gulf the establishment of an unwatched light was considered, but a light of that description of sufficient power is impracticable. A 20-mile watched light is recommended. The site selected is 134 feet above high-water. Arrangements can be made for storage of water and for its supply in common with other isolated lights. Bunder Abbas. The Admiralty Conference proposed a 15-mile light on Kishm. A suitable site, about one mile south of Kishm town (near tanks marked on chart) was examined, a light at this position would guide a ship approaching Bunder Abbas through the western channel between Larak Island and Kishm, but it is considered to be unfavourably situated without the addition of a lighted buoy for rounding the shoals extending 1J miles off Kishm point. A red sector over Larak would be advisable, as both ends of the island are low. In case political difficulties should arise in connection with the establishment of a light on Kishm Island, it is recommended as an alternative that a light vessel of small type with range of about 10 miles should be moored on the outer extreme of the shoals off Kishm point. It is considered that the adoption of the alternative proposal, whilst largely overcoming any political difficulty, will effectively mark the shoal and be of sufficient range to afford guidance through the western channel. The establishment of a light on the Quoin to a large extent discounts the urgency of an important light at Kishm. Ships approaching from the south will have a good departure from that light to pass east of Larak. Ships approaching from the westward can, without greatly increasing their distance, make the Quoin light and pass east of Larak if the weather is unfavourable for the passage of the western channel. The present buoy marking the anchorage at Bunder Abbas is the property of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and should be replaced by a buoy with a distinctive top mark. Kais, Tanb, and Shaikh Shuaib. The navigation of the gulf between Musandam and Shaikh Shuaib presents many dangers at night, notably the flat shoal south west of Kishm Island, Tanb Island (in hazy weather), Farur Shoal, Kais Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island.invisible atnih^ b6ing ^ l0W islands off hi g h la «d pa 8 l?sLrrsbSr ous to aship ^ ^ A ship bound west can obtain an approximate position to enable her to darkn^ht. ^ ^ ' is a Ws visible on a ^ aftefmSn 8 ! 1 ' T°f t0 ' Ship hauK ^ U P to the -o^hward island 0 0 ^ , g T jVa ' S W ° Uld ° bviate the dan g- which that but it would I' or gl ?p a Q, P r Ure P ° int f ° r Clearing Shaikh 8huaib &gt; Luth and ea t /f “ Unmarked daDger t0 shi P a bound lightlg Bystlm DOt ltS6lf t0 deVel 0 P m -‘ of ^e A light on Shaikh Shuaib will eliminate the danger of that island, and give a departure point for clearing Kais on an easterly course. raking advantage of Farur Island as a night mark east of Kais the lighting of Shaikh Shuaib in preference to Kais is indicated as the’best means of eliminating the danger presented by both islands. A 15-mile light on the south-west corner of Shaikh Shuaib is therefore recommended. ■ i h 16 ! lgbtlng ° f Tanb is als0 rec ommended. Course is altered off this island which cannot be always clearly seen at night. A light on Tanb will give a departure point to pass close to the north of Farur Island and clear of Farur Shoal, and serve as a clearing mark for the fiat snoai on I\ishm when making Lingah. I he site selected is on the summit of the island 165 feet above high water and near the north-west point. ‘ ’ A 20-mile light is proposed. No political difficulty is anticipated with regard to Tanb, which belongs to the Shaikh of Shargah. The Persian Government would have to be approached with reference to Shaikh Shuaib or Kais. Kais and Farur were also visited. Lingah. The establishment of a port light to facilitate the approach to Lingah is recommended. It should be situated at a height of 30 to 40 feet above the ground in order to he conspicuous by its elevation above the lower lights in the town, and could be placed in the courtyard or in front of the new offices of the British India Steam Kavigation Company. Local arrangements for the efficient maintenance of this light can be made. Ras al Mutaf. A light at Ras al Mutaf is considered necessary. All traffic from Koweit, Shaft al Arab, and Bushire, converges on, and rounds this point, and the establishment of an 11-mile light vessel near the 10-fathom patch south west of the shoals is recommended. A shore light is clearly unsuitable owing to the extent of the shoal off the shore, s. 11 . B6 Bushire. The erection of a 15-mile lighthouse on shore as proposed by the Admiralty Conference was considered. It is possible that the Persian Government may place obstacles in the way of the establishment of a light on shore. This difficulty can be avoided and the requirements of navigation better provided for by the establishment of an 11-mile light vessel moored in the outer anchorage, especially in hazy weather when, owing to the distance of the shore inside the 5-fathom line, the efficiency of a lighthouse on shore, both as a night and day mark, would be considerably reduced. A light vessel is therefore recommended. There is a beacon on Ras al Margh marking western limit of Lakfa Sands which is a useful mark for the inner anchorage. There are no buoys. The beacon and two buoys were established by the Belgian Customs officials at Bushire about four years ago. The buoys have disappeared, and the beacon is at present practically demolished. A gas buoy to mark the position of the inner anchorage off Ras al Harg is recommended, in which case the reconstruction of the beacon will be unnecessary, and both anchorages will be accessible at night. Shatt al Arab Bar. A light vessel with an 11-mile range, to mark the approach to the Bar is required. An approximate position four miles south-east of the outer buoy, as proposed by the Admiralty Conference, is concurred in. The total number of buoys at present maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company is seven, one of which, the “ Lawrence,” is in the old channel, now disused, and serves no useful purpose. It is considered that, in addition to the light vessel, the lighting of the Bar channel buoys is necessary. There is no great difficulty in navigating the river between Basra and Fao at night, and it is frequently done. It is not proposed to deal with the lighting or buoyage of the river above Fao in this report, but it may be a matter for future consideration in the event of development of trade at Mohammerah and Basra. The passage of the Bar at night offers considerable risk and difficulty. Ships which arrive at Fao or the outer buoy at night, and wish to avail themselves of a high night tide, attempt the crossing of the Bar at night, and stranding is not infrequent. British India mail steamers very often have to cross at night, but generally make arrangements for the buoys to be lit temporarily by a boat sent out from Fao. As for six months of the year the night tides are considerably higher than the day tides, the safe passage of the Bar by night may be an important matter for a large steamer, as a deeper draught is permissible than would be the case if choice is restricted to a day tide. A night passage might also, in some cases, obviate the necessity for completing with cargo outside the Bar, and would at all times of the year be of great advantage to the mail steamers which have to keep time.3 elaying the existing buoys. It is quite possible that ; eastern channel is the better. a new survey may disclose the fact that the I his is indicated by the latest Admiralty survey. he channel buoyed as proposed will require periodical examination to venty soundmgs, and it may be necessary to occasionally shift the buoys to suit variations m the channel. It is suggested that one of the officers of the vessel which will be required as a lighthouse tender should be a qualified surveyor. The Fao lights maintained by the Turkish Authorities are feeble and unreliable, but navigation would be rendered practically independent of them if a nve-mile gas buoy were placed on the inner Bar. _ The lighting of the Shatt-al-Arab is regarded as the most important item m the whole lighting scheme for the Gulf. It is pointed out that certain of these buoys will fall, as do the present ones, within the territorial waters of Turkey or Persia. Hitherto this fact has been ignored in practice, and it is believed that the Local Authorities have never interested themselves or raised objections in connection with the British India Steam Navigation Company’s arrangements for buoying It does not appear to be the province of this Committee to do more than draw attention to this aspect of the case. and a 10-mile light on Ras al Arz. There can be no doubt that from a navigational point of view the approach to the port would thus be effectively lighted, but it must be pointed out that the height of the tower required for a 20-mile light on Kubbar would be approximately twice that necessary for a 15-mile light. The height of the site on Kubbar Island is only 5 feet above high waiter. In view of the heavy cost involved in the erection of a tower for a 20-mile light, a light of only 15-mile range is recommended, in which case the range of the light proposed for Ras al Arz should be increased to 12 miles, which would involve little extra cost. Although the range of a 15-mile light will not extend to the island and shoals south-east of Failaka Island, a ship bound from the Shatt al Arab Bar to Koweit should have no difficulty in clearing those dangers, as a run of about 20 miles after losing sight of the Bar light will bring a 15-mile light on Kubbar within range. Even a 20-mile light on Kubbar Island would not effectively guard the Madura shoal. The suggestion with regard to Kubbar is only put forward provisionally m view of the incomplete survey of this locality. It is recommended that the Koweit. The Admiralty Conference proposed a 20-mile light on Kubbar Island,8 neighbourhood be re-surveyed, the position and extent of the Madura shoal verified, and the absence of other dangers placed beyond doubt. The result of this survey may conceivably indicate the necessity for modifications in the position and type of the outer light proposed for this port. With regard to the proposal to place an unwatched light on the existing beacon at Ras al Arz, it is found that the beacon is not suitably constructed for supporting a light. A 12-mile light on a new structure adjacent to the site of the existing beacon is recommended. As it is necessary to maintain a watchman to guard the day mark at Ras al Arz from depredation by Bedouin, it would be inadvisable to place an unwatched light at this point. The Political Agent anticipates no danger of interference if local light keepers are employed. Sheikh Mobarak of Koweit appears to be much interested in the proposal to light the port, and is unlikely to place any difficulty in the way. Good water is available within a mile of the Ras al Arz site, but arrangements for storage of water would be necessary on Kubbar. There are three buoys marking the anchorage, maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company. No additional buoyage is required as far as the anchorage is concerned. The Political Agent desired that the question of the channel into Shweikh should be gone into in view of possible future developments. It is considered that two small mark buoys will suffice, and that these should be preferably provided and maintained by local arrangement, as this Khor is only used as an anchorage for the Political Agent’s launch, the Sheikh’s steam yacht, and other small craft. The light, fixed red, visible five miles, recently established at the Agency by the Indian Government, meets all requirements as a harbour light. Bahrein. The Admiralty Conference propose the erection of— (1) a 20-mile light on Fasht ad Dibal, and (2) a 12-mile light on Muharrak. While the usefulness of the former is apparent, the proposed light on Muharrak is considered to be situated too far from the navigable channel to offer complete facilities for entering the port by night. It is possible that the establishment of a light on that island would not be^ altogether palatable to the Sheikh, but, in the Resident’s opinion, his objection could be overcome. In any case it is recommended that, instead of this lighthouse, a small light vessel, or gas boat, be established half a mile outside the shoal near the present outer buoy, and that the existing Kaseifa and West Spit buoys be replaced by lighted buoys, the Jadum buoy being retained in its present position. A 10-mi] e floating light at the entrance to the channel as above suggested would actually illuminate a more useful area than a 12-mile light on Muharrak, while it would indicate, without doubt, the entrance to the channel, which is necessary, if any scheme is to be effective. A making light for the port from the east and north is necessary, and a light having a range of about 20 miles on the north side of the reef at Fasht ad Dibal would be in the best position.1 C 2 ^ exposecl ske h t C ° St ° f build “g a sui ‘ a ble structure on an 3 nofose i a V bg C ° nsidered P r “ive, no other p - tion offers equal advantages from a navigational point of view east of the 7 t0 eStablish ' light vessel aboat 5 miles north- tha o h! “ ™ 3 P ° siti0n tbattbe ran g e of visibility will overlap ensure t^t ^th OT 7 f VeSSel at tbe entranCe to the to the north 0116 ” ° WiU be Seei1 ^ a shi P ^Preaching from There are numerous dangers in the approaches to this port.

There has recently been a considerable increase in trade at this place anc it may be expected to still further develop. Mail and other steamers ca there regularly, and it is recommended that a port light similar to that already proposed for Lingah be established on the sea front. Local arrangements for the efficient maintenance of this light can be made. Order of Importance. 7 * 11 18 considered that the lights proposed should be arranged in the lollowing order of importance : — (1.) Shatt al Arab Bar, light vessel and four buoys. (2.j Musandam (Little Quoin). (3.) Muscat. (4.) ■ Bushire. (5.) Shaikh Shuaib. (6.) Ras al Mutaf. (7.) Tanb. (8.) Kubbar Island (Koweit). (9.) Ras al Arz (Koweit). (10.) Bahrein. (11.) Lingah. (12.) Debai. (13.) Bunder Abbas. The first seven lights, being those most urgently required, are suggested as a convenient first instalment of the general scheme. The position assigned to Kubbar Island or its alternative in the above list has been determined upon what appear to be the claims of the port from the navigational point of view under existing conditions. Should there be grounds for taking specific account of the probability of Koweit increasing quickly in importance in connection with the building of the Baghdad Railway, its relative position in the list would be materially advanced. The port lights proposed for Lingah and Debai being inexpensive items are recommended for early establishment in anv case. S. 11. n fgfgif — 6*2 3 - «■ 10 Buoys and Beacons. 8 .

The beacon on Ras al Marg, at Bushire, was erected about four years ago by the Belgian Customs officials, and is the property of their department. Two buo 3 T s were laid at the same time, but they have disappeared. The spar buoys shown on plan of Bushire anchorage no longer exist. The beacon is in a bad state of repair. Koweit beacon was erected, and is maintained, on Ras al Arz by the Indian Government. Hie Bahrein beacon is liable to be washed away, and needs reconstructing. The Lawrence buoy on Shatt al Arab Bar marks the old channel which is now silted up, and serves no useful purpose. The spar buoys shown on the chart of Shatt al Arab Bar east of inner Bar channel no longer exist. Proposals for improving Buoyage :— Jask.—A small unlit buoy on the tail of the shoal extending two miles north-west of Task Point would be of great convenience to ships entering the anchorage. Bunder Abbas. A buoy with a distinctive top-mark in lieu of the existing anchorage buoy is recommended. If a lighthouse is erected at Kishm a lighted buoy in addition to that marking the anchorage will be required outside the shoals off Kishm Point. Bushire. A. gas buoy to mark the inner anchorage is proposed It should be moored off Ras al Marg and will render the re-construction of the beacon unnecessary and enable ships to enter the inner anchorage at night. Slmtt al Arab Par.—Four gas buoys to replace the existing buoys have been provisionally recommended in the proposals for lighting the Bar. A re-survey of the Bar will be required before they are laid. Koweit.—She present system of buoying the anchorage is satisfactory. The retention of the beacon will be unnecessary when the Ras al Arz light is erected. Bahrein. In dealing with the scheme for lighting Bahrein it has been proposed that a gas boat should replace the present outer buoy and . . nxic »v COb topil. I he existing buoy off Jadum should be retained.

Nothing is known as to the condition of the moorings. A copy of correspondence with the Company on this subject is attached. In preference to taking over any buoys from the British India Steam Navigation Company it is suggested that a more satisfactory course will be to lay new buoys on the uniform system in those positions where it is proposed m this report that buoys should be retained or established.

The lights on all the buoys should have distinctive characters, and it is proposed that all lights be white, except those on the buoys at the West Spit (Bahrein), and the inner anchorage (Bushire), for which red lights are suggested. The total number of lights and buoys in the proposed scheme is Lighthouses - 8) re Light vessels - 4 1 i b Port lights Lighted buoys _ 9 [ or if alternative pro- “ 1 posals are adopted - 8 -i 2 ! 7 Unlighted buoys - 6J U Fog Signals. 10. The question of fog signals has been considered, but though hazy weather is not uncommon, fog is of rare occurrence and short duration in the Gulf, and fog signals are not considered necessary. Lightkeepers. 11. From inquiries made it is considered that the Gulf Arab could be trained into a leasonably good lightkeeper, and there are obvious advantages in the employment of local men, but in the case of the light vessels the lightsmen might with advantage be recruited from India. In any case the crews of light vessels and lighthouses in isolated positions should be armed. Lighthouse Tender. 12. The whole of the Persian Gulf would form a large lighthouse district in itself, and it would be imperative that a specially constructed steamer, to act as the lighthouse tender, be built and kept in Commission solely for this duty which would occupy the whole of her time. A distilling plant and storage for the supply of drinking water to isolated lighthouses and light vessels should be special features of her equipment. The construction of this vessel should be undertaken before, or concurrently with, the establishment of the earlier lights. Water. 13. One of the principal difficulties in connection with the maintenance of lighthouses and vessels in the Persian Gulf is obtaining and supplying them with fresh water. The only place in the Gulf where drinking water in any quantity can be procured conveniently is the Shaft al Arab River above Fao. Ibis would necessitate the lighthouse tender making frequent trips to the river and the provision of a large storage capacity which space could be more usefully devoted to other purposes. In view of these considerations a distilling plant on board the tender has been recommended. Repairs, Ac. 14. With the exception of Basra the Gulf offers practically no facilities for repair or constructional work.13 The opinion repairs. works of Messrs.

The scheme proposed concentrates practically all the gas buoys at one end of the Gulf, which is an important consideration in view of their maintenance by the lighthouse tender. Maintenance. 1 1 . From the point of view of practical convenience and expedience, apart from any question of the incidence of cost, it appears to the Committee that the Government of India are clearly in the best position to undertake the arrangements necessary for the up-keep of the lights and buoys decided upon, anc for the administration of the lighting system generally, assuming that no international complications arise to interfere with such a course.

Correspondence regarding Boots of the British India Steam Navigation Company. 9, Throgmorton Avenue, London, E.C., 15th February 1907. (Communicated by Z y oreign Office 19£h February 1907.) Lear Mr. Maxwell, I mentioned to you the other day, when at the Foreign Office, that we had heard from India that the Hamburg-American Company had proposed to our people there that they should contribute to the up-keep of our navigation buoys in the Persian Gulf. We have told our people in reply that we prefer to continue to bear the cost of the maintenance of the buoys ourselves. As I mentioned to you, these buoys were put down by the British India Company some 20 or 30 years ago, and they have been kept in position and maintained by the Company ever since, and they have been used by all steamers frequenting the Persian Gulf without any charge having been made for their use by the British India Company. In fact we would have no means of collecting a charge had we desired to make one. It was, of course, no disadvantage to us that other steamers should use the buoys, and we had never thought of asking them to contribute. I cannot help fancying, as I mentioned to you at our meeting the other day, that there is a political move behind this proposal of the Hamburg-American Company, the object being to give Germany a vested interest in the Persian Gulf. It has occuired to me that it might be a good thing politically for us to make over the ownership of these buoys to His Majesty’s Government. I may say at once that I do not make the suggestion in order that the British India Company may benefit pecuniarily, either m the way of being repaid the cost of buoys or in escaping from the charge for their maintenance. In fact, to avoid any idea of this sort, we should be quite prepared to hand the buoys over to the Government for a nominal consideration, and we would still maintain them free of cost in return for their use. Yours sincerely, James L. Mackay. Enclosure in Foreign Office Letter of 4th June 1908. Foreign Office, Dear Sir James Mackay. 4th June 1908. We have been considering, in consultation with the Board of Trade, the question of the buoys in the Persian Gulf. Lou are no doubt aware that the Germans are anxious to participate in the laying down and up-keep of the buoys : indeed, I understand that they have already offered to share expenses with the British India Steam Navigation Company in the matter, s. 11 .16 ' l!l li II f ■! i Sir E. Grey attaches great importance to the maintenance of this service in British hands, and he desires me to ask you whether, in order that our position in regard to the buoys may be made doubly secure, the British India Steam Navigation Company would still be willing, as suggested by you in your letter to Mr. Maxwell of 15th February 1907, to make over their existing buoys to His Majesty’s Government, who would, Sir E. Grey hopes, be able to maintain them, free of cost to the Company, for the benefit of British shipping in the Gulf. I may add that we are at present in communication with the Admiralty with regard to the laying down of some additional buoys in the Gulf waters, which would be maintained by His Majesty’s Govern ment, in connection with those at present owned by the British India Steam Navigation Company, should the latter find themselves in agreement with the above proposal. Yours sincerely, Sir J. L. Mackay, G.C.M.G., Charles Harmnge. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Sir J. Mackay, British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, to J. E. Ferard, Esq., Assistant Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 9, Throgmorton Avenue, London, 4th September 1908. We have now received full particulars from Bombay, showing the buoys belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company in the Persian Gulf, together with charts showing the positions of the buoys marked thereon. Ton will observe that there are no buoys belonging to the Com pany in Bushire. There are 17 buoys altogether in the Persian Gulf belonging to the Company; 15 are marked on the chart, and the other two, which were sent up in July 1908 to be placed at the mouth of the Shatt-al- Arab, had not been actually placed when Bombay wrote on 31st July, but we will get information from Bombay showing where these last two buoys had been placed. I enclose a letter, dated 31st July, from Bombay, giving particulars of the buoys, showing their cost. I also send five charts, in which the position of all the buoys is marked, with the exception of the two at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab to which I have referred above. In case these charts should go adrift again, please note that I have kept a spare copy in this office. Jas. Mackay. No. 270. Dear Sir, Bombay, 31st July 1908. Navigation in Persian Gulf.

Many of the original buoys, with thei moorings, have been renewed since first laid down, and as the Com* keeps the buoys, Ac., in a good state of repair, and incurs considt expense m upkeep, there is practically no difference between the origin^ PS- _ i.jHiniiiiiw 18 We advised in our letter No. 226, of 3rd instant, that two buoys were being sent up owing to a change in the channel at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab. We have no information so far as to whether both these buoys have been made use of, or whether the Commander of the “Megna,” who is re-buoying the bar, has been able to lift and make use of the old buoys. An attempt to lift one of the old buoys failed. So soon as we can obtain definite information we shall advise you. The charts sent by this mail give the position so far as it is known to us, but do not include the two new buoys now being.l^id. We are, &amp;c., Mackinnon, Mackenzie, &amp; Co., P. W.
