(b) Passports have been returned. As far as w* we know none are withheld. (o) Our e.8j»toh ffo. 53 of September 25th, fUrnlahee the information about what he is up to. 2. We had an unexpected visit yesterday from Chulam miesaln Wvderabadi, one of Raji Abdul Huasain's sons. He was returning from Yezd, where he had been transacting some joi^ercial business, and while at Kerman called in to see us. His visit was welcome as we were able to discuss Charbar affairs generally, and the Khojas in particular, and we also too)c the opportunity to tell him what we thought of his rascal 0i a tath «r. the other Hyderabadis, about changing their ain&amp;ii about l.a.lng Iran and of r.turnin*- to tht. country. The Chancery, / Ve British Legation^ Tehran.tfe made it perfeotly to him and asked him to oonTey to his father, brothers, and other Khojas that a condition of the aooeptanoe of their renunciation petitions was that they should leave Iran, and that if they no* decide to stay they do so entirely at their own risk, and that we shall not be able to do anything more for them. We told ue that there were only four Kao^as in Gh&amp;rbar when he left about two months ago to oomw to Bancarabbae Kerman and read, and these four were Haji A.bdul Hussain Hyderabad!

It further eaerged that eight of the petitioners would be expeated to perform their military eenrioe before they would be allowed to leave the country and that the decision of the council of Ministers covered only the petitioners themselves and not their wives or families, who had also been included in the petitions. A lesser difficulty was provided by the fact that the details of tha various families ae given by the Ministry for foreign Affairs inevitably failed to correspond to those in the pousi- Hie 4ajesty’s negation. 4 # Yhe various points were flret discussed by His Majesty's Consul with the head of the i aasport and nationality section of the Ministry for Foreign Affaire, as a result of which the Iranian attitude became much more clearly definedj and I was then able to taite up e&gt;ci in an aide-memoire which I left with the Acting Klaiatar for Foreign Affaire on September 13th. X will endeavour to deal with them one by ones (a) The case of Haji *vbdul usee in. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs explained orally tiiat this man, after he had submitted his petition, had written to the police to state that he wished after all to retain his Iranian nationality. Later, however, he had telegraphed aaKing that hi a petition should not be witiurawn. The Ministry were not quite certain what the present position was in hie case and would enquire further* )ajor Lincoln gave me, however, a more disquieting explanation, namely that he had heara privately that the man's petition had bee* turned down, as the authorities intended to try him at Ker&amp;an on a charge of inducing Iranian subjects to /renouncerenounce nationality ami, generally, of oaueing trouble at Jbarbar. It aoes in fact eeaa absolutely clear that this man vls&amp;ee to renounce hie Iranian nationality* I reoeira petit!one on the subject froa hi* by nearly every poet and he has cent me, amongst other papers, copies of e telegram end of a letter eddreseed by hira to the Ministry for Foreign Affaire in which he definitely states that he wiahes to be reoogniaed as a British subject* it well to take up hit* oas© with some vigour and I have therefore urged in writing that his petition saould be accepted without further delay* At the same tine I informed Monsieur doheily orally that it would create a very bad impression if this man, the leader of the Khoja community, were to be refused permission to renounce his Iranian nationality ana mentioned to hi* the disquieting rumours which had reached ae about hie being put on trial. I expressed the strong hope that they were untrue but urged meet earnestly that, if there had been any such intention on the part of the authorities, it should be abandoned forthwith; (b; Military service, the Ministry explained that Artiele das (4) of the Civil Code, which was passed by the Majlis on February 16th last, and of which a copy was enclosed in *y despatch go, 92 of the 13th May lest, laid down that Iranian subjects who wished to renounce their Iranian nationality must first perform their military ear/ice* the law provided for no exceptions and no exemption could therefore be given to the eight men in question* In reply X pointeu out that such a requirement couldonly t&amp;tf efUMit of postponing to t*n indefiaitti psriod in the future e final eolution of this ^ueotioxi» of wftioh an early oettlement eaa »o earnestly to he desired* I further drew attention to the fact tuat the agreeaent between his Majesty*a Legati&lt;m and the I'lniatry for Fo^oigo Affairs f in virtue of whioh these men were to t&gt;e allowed to renouuiee tlrieir Iranian nationality ana leave tne oountry, was concluded prior to tne passage toy the iflejli* of the above artloie of tiie Civil code* no mention had been made by the Ministry at the tiae of any requirement as to tne performance of ailitary service and I felt strongly tnat it was not right in equity tnat regulations passed at a iater date should be applied to the present oase* X therefore asked that, as an act of grace ana as an earnest of the readiness of the Iranian oovernaentto dispose of the matter, steps should be taken to exempt the wen in question from Military service, so that they could leave Iran at the same llae as their fellows; (o) position of the wives and families of the petit!oners* 'The Ministry explained that the decision of the council of Ministers covered only the petitioner© themselves* Their wives and families remained Iranian subjects* though no obstaolss would be placed in the way of their leaving the country on Iranian passports* This decision was obviously lively to cause further difficulties and conpllostions and aecmed also to be generally petty-minded; so X decided to take the point up with Monsieur Schelly* explaining that even if the wives and families wars allowed to leave the country* they would be involved in considerable extra expense owing to the necessity of obtaining additional passports* taany of the persons concerned were of very small financial substance and the deoiaion of the Iranian Government waa likely to oause them /somesome ftardsbii)* I further drsw atteatian to the faot uxat Article 9Bn (a) of the Civil Cod* read as followas- *Th« wife and children of the person who reaounoea his nationality acoordin^ to this artiele do not lose their Iranian nationality, whether the children are minors or of age, unless the pez^miesicm of the council of 'winistare alloes tiiem to renounce tneir nationality*^ I pointed out that it was thus dear that the caw ompo^ered the Counoil of Ministers to extend thair decision to ©over the wives and families of the petitioners and urged moat strongly that this snould ee done, hot*' in order to spare trie persons concerned unnecessary hardship and in order that a final settlement might be reached of tills protracted matter* (d) In order that confusion tuay he avoided later, I have also given the ministry full details of the various families. Their own list sometimes omitted wives and children, sometimes included them when none in f&amp;ot existed; and one petitioner was included twice over, being credited with a different birthplace each time and once being described as childless and once as having three gone* But while 1 have thought It best to correct these details, I do not thinfc any difficulties are likely to arise in this respect as the authorities at uharbar must surely have accurate information about each family* $• I enquired of itenaleur shelly on October 9th whether any further progress had yet been made in the matter, and he told me th&amp;v he had written to the Ministry of the interior supporting all my suggestions* 6* 1 am sending copies of this despatch to his Majesty'* principal secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Wo* 461), to The honourable the political kesidsnt in the Persian Gulf (Ho* 106), and to his Majesty's Consul at /HLsrmanKerman (&amp;o« 3?)« I hare the honour to toe with the higheat reject.

Foreign and political Department of the GOTerissent of India, Hew Delhi.unaware that Julton Ardelan had reoeivefi fresh orders and that he could not resume work until either he reoeiTed inetruotlons to do eo or Sultan Ardelan Informed him that he had himself received orders not to interfere/ in this question an/ more# Major Lincoln was, however, in fact aware that Sultan Ardelan had received three cypher telegram* during the previous two days, though he naturally did not mention this to the Chief of polioe, and he had further received confidential information from a reliable source that these telegrams contained orders to him not to interfere any more in the work of the chief of police* a* rir* Loxlcy at onoe br©u*$it the situation to the notice of the passport and nationality Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and was informed that instructions had just been sent to the Chief of olloe ordering him to resume work and making it olear that Sultan Ardelan was not to inter* fere* M^jor Lincoln was, however, told by the Chief of Polioe when he saw him again that he still could net resume work* The orders issued by the General Staff had been to the effeot that the garrison at Char bur should not take any part in matters affecting the (k&gt;vernor&amp;te or police* Sultan Ardelan maintained, however, he was now Acting Military gover nor, that these orders only applied to him in his capacity as Commander of the Garrison and that, while he himself was willing to undertake the necessary work qua Acting Military Governor, he could not do so since he was without instruotions This information was later confirmed by sultan Ardelan himself who attllod on Major Unooln and told him that it wao on Instruction*-3 ins tractions received from the Governor, Yawar Tayyar, v/ho was at that moment absent in the Interior (see my telegram $o. 43 to the Foreign Office) that he interpreted the orders of the General Staff as applying only to the Garrison* 4* A farther, and this time very firmly worded, appeal to the rinistry of Foreign Affairs resulted in the despateh on Mareh 5th of instructions to the Governor himself that Sultan Ardelan was not to Interfere in any capacity with the worfc of the Chief of polloe. Whether or not as the result of these instruotious, the Governor returned to ch&amp;rbar on ’'arch 9th and within two days all the Khojas and all the Katris had been allowed to see Major Linooln and to submit their petitions* fhere only remained the n&amp;lnohis as to whom the Chief of police had received no instructions, in spite of the f&amp;et that more than one request had been made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they should be treated on exactly the same footing as the Khojas. A final appeal to floury psfondiary, however, caused the last of these obstacles to be surmounted, the petitions of the Baluchis were accepted on March 15th and Major Lincoln, after having been at Charbar since the beginning of Peoamber, was at last able to leave by the mail ste&amp;mer of March 19th* I 5* I shall uot be in the least surprised if we now encounter more difficulties at Tehran before the Iranian Government agree to grant those petitions but we have at any rate progressed one stage further. Yo achieve even this partial success, however, it has been necessary for me to speak to the prime Minister, the rinister for Foreign Affairs and the Acting :Haistor for Foreign Affairs, to leave with them aide-ald«~aiBtoir«a that it would now bo too wo&amp;rieonio a tmk to eouut # and to boiabapd ioury csfandiary both vrf.th lottore and tolophone oallB at the moot firequent intorTalo. It htoi tdton from January Slot, when the Ministry of foreign Affairs wrote officially accepting my proposals* to arch Ibth to maJce the local officials at Charbar act on their instructions, ant apart from absorbing all tho energies of Major Lincoln, this question ever since ay arrival has taken up an utterly Ais- *&gt;rQport!on&amp;te amoutit of my time and that of the members of my staff. If X have pursued it so strongly, it has been less because of its actual importance than because I regarded it as somewhat of a test case. I wanted in fact te see whether the Iranian authorities were prepared to translate their profuse assurances of goodwill into notion and, being desirous of clearing away the various small ooitt roversies that were clogging our relations before proceeding to disou&amp;s the more important political issues, I have always made a particular point of trying to get this question settled. A measure of success has now been achieved and to that extent I am well satisfied; but it has at times been necessary to exercise almost superhuman patience and the relays and cheeks which have had to be endured do not augur well for the rapid settle* merit of more Important problems. 6. I should not like to close this despatch without paying a tribute to the great goodwill which has always been shown in this matter both by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affaire and by iloury Fofandiary; nor without expressing my very high appreciation of the services rendered by Major Lincoln, who has had to endure a stay of three and a half months-5- aoatiis at Char tour uad who aa the wxn on the epok aaet neeesaar- ily have £o*ad the dimeultiee and deltgre far more exaeperatin^ than anyone remote from the aotual scene* He novv ham the satisfaction of knowing that he hast srucceeefully accomplished the tack which he set or % to perform and it ie with the great eel pleasure that I acknowleage that no man could have acoompliehed it hotter. 7.

My Lord, As X had the honour to Inf ora Your &gt;xoellency in ay despatch Mo. 19 of January 26th, an arrangement was eventually reached with the Persian Ministry for foreign Affairs for the solution of the difficulties arising out of the situation of certain British nationals living at Charbar. Unfortunately the 'trouble was not ended by 2 the issue of the consequent instructions to the looal authorities. On January 27th his Majesty’s enaul telegraphed to me that, in spite of the receipt of these instructions, the chief of Police and the covernor of Charbar continued to place every hindrance in the way of a solution, denying at first that they had received instructions and subsequently refusing on various pretexts to carry then out. Major Lincoln also reported that snortly after his interview the Governor left for the interior for an indeflnita period. 5 . I therefore saw the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs as soon as possible on January 23th, giving his a 8U aft ary of Major Lincoln’s information in the form of an aide-memoire (copy enclosed) and pressing that urgent Instructions be sent to Charbar. On January 89th X was assured that these instructions had been sent. 4. On January 31st, Major Lincoln telegraphed again, stating that, in spite of the receipt of renewed instructions, the Acting Governor and Chief of ioliee continued their obstructive tactics. I therefore called on His excellency The right honourable The Earl of tfilllngdon, a.M.&amp;.I., etc*, etc., etc.. /the MKi LLLhI*th« Acting Minister for Foreign Affnira again on February l B t t and nanded dim a aeooiul aide-»eaoire&gt; of wnici, X iiare the honour to enclose a copy# I pointed out to iu excellency that I was reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the Persian Government were lacking either in the necessary authority or in the desire to see their instructions carried out, and in general apofce as etrongly as passible to Vonsieur boheily urging him to take immediate steps to enforce the execution of the instructions. dis kxcellenoy, who seemed somewhat taken aback at theae new developments, promised to see the Minister of the Interior himself and ensure that instructions of hie own drafting were despatched. Being Friday, however, it was impossible for hi* to carry out this intention until February 2nd. 5 # On February 2nd, I was informed by the official of the Ministry for Foreign Affaire in charge of the caae that he had seen the Minister of the Interior who was sending renewed instructions to the local authorities at Oharbar ordering them to carry out the arrangement, also that tiie Chief of police at Bander Abbas had been instructed to proceed at once to Charbar to investigate the matter. Sioury Ksfandiary aaeured me moat emphatically that the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Interior had every intention of enforcing obedience and of seeing the understand' ing reached with me put into force# He stated that the central authorities were greatly dissatisfied with the local Chief of Police. 6 # In view of these renewed assurances of the good intentions of the Persian Government (which I see no reason to disbelieve) and of the visit of the chief of police from Bander Abbas, I have instructed ^a^or Ancola to remain at Charbar for the present.

Major Lincoln took the firat atep by callinc on the Governor on the morning of January 26th* Me enquired whether either the Governor of the Chief of Police had received any inatruetions, aa he had received hio, which wmre to put himself in touoh with the perelan authorities and see the parties concerned, in order to explain the situation to them and to help them to draw up fresh petitions. fhe Governor denied having received any instructions, but on Major Uncoln’s suggesting that perhaps the Chief of police had, he said that he did not know but that he had asked him to come round. shen the latter arrived, Major Lincoln repeated hi® enquiries, in reply to which the Chief of police at first denied having received any instructions. Later, however, he admitted that he had receivsd Instructions more or less similar to Major Lincoln^, and after further discussion and enquiries on the letter's part, the Governor also admitted that he was aware of the receipt of these instructions, which he at one moment said that he was waiting to receive from the police, and at another that he had received but had only glanced at. 3. A discussion lasting three hours then ensued, during the course of which Major Lincoln repeatedly pointed out what his instructions were and asked as s first step that the persons conoerned should be allowed to see him. 4. The Governor's attitude was that, belag a Military Governor, he could not interfere in the matter unless he received /orders«• $ «• orders from Uie Military authorities* the Chisf of *olice at first declarea that his instructions did not concern those persons who had already euhaittad petitions for the renunciation of their Persian nationality* ?hoje cases were closed and he had already forwarded the whole dossier dealing with thea to Tehran; and his instructions only applied to any other pereons who night now wish to renounce their Persian nationality. Major Jtaooln pointed out that this interpretation quite inadmissible since, so far as he was aware* there ware no other such persons and the whole object of hie visit was in uoafit?Culon with those who had already submitted petitions for the renunciation of their Persian nationality* The Jhief of police persisted, However, in all his arguments, the Governor agreeing with and supporting him, and he added that he had telegraphed his reply to fehran. ifajor ilncoln again asked for tne aen concerned to be allowed to see hia, but both Persian officials gave inaeolsive replies, at tiaes agreeing anu at tiaea refusing* ^ter the onief of police had left, the Governor aaia that he woula read over the instructions which this official had received and would decide whether or not these men ooulu be allowed to see iajor Lincoln* Major blncoln reported that the interview proved moat unsatisfactory and pointed to the inevitable conclusion that both officials were determined to place obstructions and difficulties in als way* 6* following morning Major Lincoln wrote a letter to tne Governor enquiring whether the Khojas and other persons concerned would be allowed to see him that evening* The Governor did not reply but instead sect for iajor Lincoln’s interpreter who found tne Governor and Chief of police together and to hia surprise discovered tnat the Governor was about to leave Charbar on a tour to tne interior* on this occasion the Governor stated that, as the instructions concerned only the community of Tetris nnd as the chief of Police had already forwarded the papers /concerning• 3 *• concerning tne Khojee and othara to Taluraa# ■ incoln could not ••© than. Both official• definitely stated that, whatever course was adopted, only those persons, the foreign nationality of whose fathers could bs proved to their satisfaction, would he allowed to draw up petitions and sign ths necessary procfca- verbal, after which they night he allowed to ass : ajor Lincoln if they desired to do so* This lost point appears to conflict entirely with the srrangenents reached and, in general, tr v*: tuib account of developments at Charhar His we^esty's Minister is forcsd, with regret, to conclude that hia efforts and those of the Persian Government to achieve a satisfactory solution of this cjuestion are being obstructed by the officials on epot. It seems olsar, for instance, that though tne prowl£$&gt;&gt;1 Instructions had reached the Governor and Jhlef of police, the latter would have taicen no action on then or even admitted having received then had not His Majesty's uonsul mads the enquiry reported in his telegram. 8. His Majesty's Minister must beg the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to cause urgent instructions to be sent to the Chief of Police at Charbar and to the Governor, or his Leputy in his ebsence, mahlng it olsar to him in particular that, as arranged with His Majesty’s Minister, all persons who had previously renounced ir’ereisn nationality should be allowed to see Major Lincoln st ones end that ths Governor must accept ths petitions drawn up and forward them to Tehran, leaving it to the Imperial Government to take the final decision whether to accept them or not; and in general that the arrangement mads by the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty's Minister in agreement, be carried out without delay.

Indeed, so far from carrying them out, the Acting Governor of Charbar haa informed ilia Majesty’s Consul that he can take no step in execution of them without reference to the Governor who, as already stated, haa gone on tour into the interior. The Chief of police in the meanwhile continues to maintain that the oases in question cannot toe re-opened and that therefore, regardless of the understanding reached. His Majesty* Consul cannot toe allowed to see these persons. 4 . His majesty*s Miniater must otoservs that the attitude of the Chief of Polios not only appears to toe in direct contradiction with the instructions which iiis Excellency assured him had been sent, tout la in direct conflict with the understand lag reached. 6.

The Governor will them forward these petitions direct to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The above undertaking was embodied in an official note, which also stated that the necessary instruct! had been issued to the Governor. as, however, there were oertain points which this communication left rather vague, I called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and &lt;&amp;taln*d /from His excellency Ths Light Honourable The Lari of Vlllingdon, G.M.s.I., •tc., ate., etc.. M&amp;l D&amp;LHXfrom him the following further explanation*. ..oiieily •aid that the instructions sent to the Gowernor also stated that Els Majesty’s Consul was to he given full liberty to see the persons concerned and to assist them in drawing up their petitions. Categoric orders had been sent that no difficulties whatever were to be placed in his way and Sohsily even asiced me to instruct Ua^or dncaln to report to me by telegram if he met with any further trouble. 4. ..ohally saw no objection to Eajor Lincoln retaining certified copies of all petitions subaittsd to the Governor sad he stated that all passports and other British identity documents removed from the individuals concerned, which X discovered had been sent to Tehran, had been returned to Charbar with instructions that they should be restored to their owners. 6. We also agreed that further discussions should take place as to the length of time to be allowed the persona concerned to settle up their affairs and leave the country• The Persian Nationality haw provides that persons la such oases shall have a year to sell their Immoveable property end X urged that they should be given s similar period themselves before they were forced to leave Persia. In any case 1 was assured that reasonable time would be given and X do not think that they will find themselves turned out at short notice. 6. The above arrangements differ considerably in detail from those which X originally advocated in my note of Leeeaber 15th, but they appear to me to secure our main objective, since it is an understood tiling that the Persian Government will accept all bona fide petitions. I have instructed Major Lincoln to exercise every ears In seeing that petitions are only submitted in eases where, in his opinion, the petitioners have an Indieputtb le claim to British /nationalitnfttlo&amp;allty* T. I do not wish to worry you with thw long story of th« delays, the rsmindsrs and ths innumerable conTsrsstions which preceded the resshing of this agreement* It is perhaps of interest, howewer, to mention that the oriental secretary called on i^aeral Ayrua, the hief of ioliee, early this month and informed him of all the reports which had been received in his Majesty’s legation of the ill-treatment of these British nationals by the Charbsr police and of the manner in which J ajor Uncoln's movement^ were spied upon. ksther surprisingly grrmm stated tf^at he nad had a lot of tremble with the Chief of iolloe at Charbar and was thinking of replacing him by soaeon*! else* lie was proposing to send a senior officer to enquire into the situation# rte also asked hr* Trott to supply him privately with details of ths eases of pollee oppression.

Since the date of that minute the Persian Government have made no progress in dealing with the petitions submitted by British subjects (Khojas) for the renunciation of their Persian nationality, and it will be remembered that when in July last the interpreter of the Bandar Abbas Consulate was sent to Charbar to advise and I assist the British nationals in question,he was lured on board the mail steamer by the Persian police and deported back to Bandar Abbas (P.Z.4998/34 and 6069/34). The position on the arrival of Mr.Knatchbull Previous papers: Hugessen, the new British Minister at Teheran was that all the persons concerned had already been forced, apparently by unfair pressure to accept Persian nationality/^) It seemed useless to expect that those who wished/ 2730 1000 4.34« wished to divest themselves of this Persian nationality would he allowed to remain in Persia without molestation and Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen therefore decided to concentrate on endeavouring to secure that they should he allowed to „ wind up their affairs and leave. The note which he addressed to the Persian Government on 15th December last is flagged 'A”. The note gives a useful summary of events since the n interpreter' incident and makes proposals for a friendly solution of the question. The chief complaints against the Persian authorities which are brought out in the note are the improper pressure put upon British subjects to take out Persian nationality documents (paragraph 4) and the treatment accorded to the Consul at Kerman since he visited Charbar at the end of November last as the result of an understanding reached with the Persian Government. In spite of the fact that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed of the Consuls visit well in advance they apparently failed to pass the information on to Charbar and Major Lincoln was prevented from landing for three hours while^the permission of the Chief of Police was being obtained (paragraph 5). More serious than this is the fact that the petitioners have been prevented by the Persian local authorities from visiting the Consul (paragraph 6). From Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen 1 s telegram of 3rd February, the latest paper on the file, it will be seen that he recently obtained the agreement of the Persian Government to a solution whereby persons who could show that their fathers possessed British nationality and who desired to retain this nationality, should submit their petitions afresh, that on their petitions being accepted they should be given a reasonable time to wind up their affairs and leave Persia, and that meanwhile H.M.Consul should have liberty to visit them and assist them in drawing up •is their petitions. In spite however of this agreement the local authorities at Charbar, although they have apparently received the/ Minute L-h 2956 60Minute La Department. the requisite instructions from Tehran, have continued to be obstructive. The Minister has now received renewed assurances from the Central Government that the matter will be settled rapidly. While he sees no reason to distrust these assurances, the cause of the difficulties is in the attitude of the local authorities and Major Lincoln who has now been at Charbar since the end of November is in an extremely awkward and delicate itiyn. pos *o L i&gt;%a. 7 V' CAAA d Tj (XX. /IcaX t i l r ^r~ L t l\\ o^-aa.

After further representations by me renewed instructions were sent to local authorities on January 29th.

Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that the matter would be settled rapid!y* (Eud of 10« I see no reason to distrust these assurances: difficul. ty seems to lie in the attitude of local authorities who are no doubt conscious of their responsibility for earlier real- nf British Indians and are trying to avoid having to climb down or be shown upo Meanwhile His Majesty’s Consul ,Kerman,has been at Charbar since November 28th in an extiemely difficult po tiorn I do not like to withdraw him firstly because it would mean surrender at least to the local authorities (as suming as I do that Ministry of Foreign Affairs are not try* ing to delude me) and secondly because I fear further mal treatment of British Indians if he leaves,, On the othei hand I do not like to leave him there much longer, I may lator have to ask for your instructions as to some alternative method of securing proper treatment of these British nationals In the meantime this is merely to inform you of tne position^ I am still hoping assurances given by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and visit of Chief of Police from Bund -r Abbas nay produce settlement.

When I saw Kazemi a few days later about the flag incident at Bushire I took the opportunity of saying that I appeared to have inherited a number of tiresome cases, not of first importance, which seemed to be spoiling our relations and that I also noticed a considerable amount of acrimonious correspondence and nagging which I was sure did no good to either side and which I hoped he would join with me in trying to stop. Later in our conversation I produced an example of this in the shape of a letter to Mallet from Noury Esfandiari about the Khojas of Charbar. I enclose a translation of this. I handed Kazemi the original and said it was just the kind of thing I so strongly deprecated: as far as I was concerned I should be quite happy if I never saw it again, and I looked suggestively towards a fire which was blazing just behind me. Kazerai kept the letter. I have since heard that Noury is much hurt at my action as he is unable to see anything offensive in the letter 1 . . This interview took place on December 22nd; I hope I shall hear no more of it. As to the general question of the Khojas I am somewhat worried. We ca^t leave the unlucky Lincoln indefinitely at Charbar, but we can f t withdraw him without admitting defeat. He has become a sort of hostage. I am pressing the Persian Government for an answer to my proposals. Kazemi,Kazemi, in conversation, agreed that they were reasonable. But now he has gone to Geneva and will be away a month, and anyhow his spoken word is worth little. Suheili does not appear unreasonable. I am to see him on December 30th, the first chance after the holidays* But it is a complicated case and I fear they will take ages to study their dossier. Anyhow I am beginning to get over my earlier fear that the Government of India would demand more drastic action than I have thought feasible. I have tried to avoid some impracticable demand based on prestige alone, to which it would be hopeless to expect the Persian Government to yield.■■■ TRANSLATION - prom Mirza Fathullah Khan Noory Isfandiari (Passport and Nationality)• To His Majesty’s Consul. ? Mr. Mallet ?. Dated 28th Azar 1313 19th December 1934. Received 21st December, 1934. My dear Friend, With reference to your letter of the 17th November last in regard to the treatment of local officials in respect of British subjects residing at Cbarbar, I have the honour to state that necessary investigations were made by me in this connexion through the authorities concerned. It appears that after the opening of the Civil Registration Office at Charbar, there have been seven families of Persian inhabitants who, trying to evade taking out sijills, had fled from the country but were prevented by the local police who confiscated their boat. The property in question belonged to Persian citizens who received them back and did not concern British subjects. According to reports received, British subjects have never had any contact with alleged officials at the time of distribution of identity papers and the police have never bidden any person to compel him to accept Persian nationality. In these circumstances, you are requested to cause to reprimand the person who reports to the Legation such forged and unfounded news and whose object it is to produce misunderstanding, in order that he would refrain from repetition.

Dated, the 10th March, 1934. f—r , ‘ r 7 T Subject : Persian Nationality Law ^ Sir, L 19 3 /l y December 1933, I have the honour to enclose herewith Captain Lincoln^ Report No. D.O.E-C of 6th February 1934, and. to give the following resume of the somewhat complicated question. 2. At the end of February 1932 complaints were received from a number of British Indian subjects resident at Charbar that local Persian authorities insisted on treating them as Persian subjects by refusing to allow them to leave that Port except on Persian travel documents and indicatingthat the British Indian passports that they held were no longer recognised as valid. 3. It was then discovered that the enclosure to despatch No. 506 of the 4th October 1929 from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, had not been communicated to British Indian subjects domiciled at Jask and Charbar in Persian Mekran. As a result a number of persons who were deemed to be Persian subjects under Article 1 of the Persian Nationality Law had not applied for renunciation of their Persian nationality under the terms of Article 2 of the said Law, nor had others whose ages exceeded 18 years availed them selves of Article 1 of the Act of 21st October 1929 (enclosure No. II of Serial No. 59 of Foreign and Political Department file 204-N/28)• This would not appear to have practically affected the position of British Indian subjects at Charbar, since the Persian Government - vide paragraph 10 below - stated later that the Articles of the Nationality Law, which permitted individuals under certain terms to renounce their newly imposed Persian nationality, were only applicable to those of non-Asiatic descent and non-Mohamadan religion. Moreover they - the British/ His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary &amp; Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. With reference to your despatch No.236 of 10th- 2 - British Indian subjects concerned - have unanimously stated to Captain Lincoln (vide paragraph 4 of his Report) that they will not accept Persian nationality under any circumstances whatsoever. On the other hand Captain Lincoln informs me that certain British Indian subjects in Bandar Abbas area, who applied originally under Article XIII of the Nationality Law, have been permitted by the Persian Government to renounce their Persian Nationality and dispose of their property in accordance with the text of the Act, without any question so far arising of their having to leave the country. 4. In the beginning of 1932 the Police authorities at Charbar refused to accept the British passports of 6 British Indian subjects resident at Charbar. The matter was reported to His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran in Bushire despatch No.64/ 780 of 12th April 1932. Further details in connection with these individuals were communicated to His Majesty*s Minister in Bushire despatch No.92/1264 of the 18th June (copy attached), who addressed the Persian Government on the 14th July 1932. 5. In his telegram No.125 of the 6th September 1932 to the Foreign Office, London, (Serial No.218), His Majesty*s Minister communicated the readiness of the Persian Government to entertain sympathetically for a further short period applications for relinquishment of Persian nationality. 6. A notice to British subjects was published in the Persian newspapers on the 6th September 1932 and was given wide publicity in my consular area, whilst a Press Communique to this effect was issued to the Press in India on the 20th January 1933 (endorsement NO.F.204-N/28 of 24th January 1933). 7. In order to assist the British Indian subjects at Charbar Captain Lincoln, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman, visited Charbar in January 1933 and having thoroughly examined the situation issued certificates of British nationality/mmm .'X 1 ®1 4 - 3 - nationality to 68 individuals, 8. The local Persian officials were fully aware of the requirements and necessities of the Nationality Law and Act and gave Captain Lincoln all the assistance he required, 9. In Circular telegram No. 1 of the 10th March 1933 His Majesty*s Minister intimated that provisional arrange ments for permitting British subjects born in Persia, who had previously failed to renounce their Persian nationality within period prescribed by Supplementary Article of Law to do so under Article XIII, expires 20th March. Those who still wish to do so and whose Consular formalities cannot be completed in time should nevertheless submit their formal petitions before above date to appropriate authorities and hand in their certificates afterwards”. On the 29th March His Majesty*s Minister requested the Persian Government to refrain from enforcing Article XIII of the Persian Nationality Law under which persons relinquishing Persian nationality must dispose of any property owned by them in Persia. 10. The Persian Government*s reply to this request - vide Tehran Legation Circular despatch No,14 of the 26th July 1933 (copy to India No.145) - seems to me to amount to this, that the Persian Government reads the word 'foreign* in Article 1 of the Law to mean those people who are of non- Asiatic descent and of a religion other than a Mohamadan. 11. While I agree that with the Law, as it is at present, it would be better for those who were British subjects before the passing of the Law to settle down and accept that Law, it would not appear that the Persian Government having put a special meaning to the word 'foreign* we are therefore unable to protect and keep our one time subjects. The 'concession* alluded to in the above quoted Circular despatch of 26th July 1933, surely only applies to the /the extension of time, not to the entire new interpretation which the Persian Government subsequently chose to give to the wording of the Law. The wording of the Law is perfectly clear; and it appears to me that any action indirect contradiction of that Law, unless supported by an amending Law, is ultra vires . 12* This latest reading of the Law was communicated to the persons concerned in Charbar. Soon afterwards complaints of general victimisation were received and communicated to His Majesty^ Legation on the 12th October, 1933, under tele grams Ho.151 and 152. Captain Lincoln brought these complaint to the notice of the local authorities who have given assurances, especially the new Deputy Governor (vide para graphs 1 and 6 of Captain Lincoln*s despatch D.0.NO.2-C), that they will do all they can to make the lot of these people easy (vide paragraph 6 of the abovementioneddespatch) until the question of their nationality is definitely settled. The Chief of Police who seems to have troubled these people has been changed and been replaced by, I am told, a sympathetic man. The settlement of the complaints must rest on the whole nationality question. As to the robberies, perhaps these could be brought to the notice of the Persian Govern ment. The latter - vide Circular despatch No. 19 of 20th September 1933 will presumably be asked to send to you the passports confiscated from British subjects. 13. In reply to my despatch of 12th October His Majesty’s Charge d»Affaires regretted that no practical steps could be taken to assist property owners, as it was pretty certain that the Persian Government would insist on the petitioners leaving the country. 14. In order that the true position could be explainedto tiie 68 odd British subjects I thought it advisable for Captain Lincoln to revisit Charbar and with your consent he did so at the end of January 1934, remaining till the 6th February, and has submitted the report referred to in para 1 above, 15. This report deals with:- (1) Persons owning immoveable property. (2) Persons without immoveable property. (3) Persons who have been recently the victims of robberies and raids in the neighbourhood of Charbar. (4) Victimisation by the local Persian officials. 16. (1) and (2) are summarised below, while (3) and (4) are dealt with in para.13 of this despatch 17. As regards (1) Persons owning immoveable property . One and all of the individuals of Charbar declared their repugnance at the idea of Persian nationality and asserted they would never accept it and that they would leave the country even though their applications are rejected. They would, of course, prefer that their applications be accepted and that they be permitted to live and carry on in their business as in Charbar, but, if not, they are, they say, quite prepared to leave. (2) Persons without immoveable property . These are mostly Baluchis and definitely refuse to accept Persian nationality and are willing to leave the country forthwith. a large number have already gone. The Persian Chief of Police when asked why he refused these persons permission to leave, replied that as they were born in Persia they were Persian subjects according to the Law and that without definite instructions from higher authority he could not let them leave the country. ■?. um U P* A nationality Law was passed by the Persian Government, under which, briefly, (vide Sections 4- 6 - J and 5 of Articles 1 and XIII), individuals born in Persia whom we consider to be British Indian subjects on reaching the age of 18, could renounce their Persian nationality, with the sanction of the Council of Ministers, provided that they gave an undertaking within one year of the date of relinquishing their nationality that they would transfer their immoveable property to a Persian subject. Later a Supplementary Act was passed covering individuals who were over 18 at the time of the passing of the Law. Later still - vide Circular despatch No.14 from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires (copy to Government of India, No.145), the Persian Government replied to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires (1) that individuals who renounced their Persian nationality had to leave Persia and (2) what amounts to this that the escape from the Law and the Act does not apply to those of Asiatic descent and Mohammedan religion. This being so the Persian Government are arbi trarily claiming or expelling our subjects, confiscating their passports, and yet at the same time, contrary as it is denying them exit from the country. I am aware, of course, that a Government has the power arbitrarily to turn out anyone from its own country, but I am sure that such was not the intention of the Persian Government originally. In conclusion I venture to suggest for your consideration if it would be possible to approach the Persian Government once more on the matter. Safeguard 18 of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty might possibly be of some use in this connection. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have the honour, etc., Sd/- T.C. FOWLE. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Copy of a demi-official letter No*2.C, dated Chartoar, the 6th February 1934 from Dr*C.H*Lincoln, H.M’s* Consul,Kerman; to Captain E.H.Castrell, Secretary to the Hon’hle* the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Reference your D.O* Ro#2l/37/90, dated 13th January 1934, regarding the numerous petitions received from Charhar, complaining of the victimisation of Khojas and Baluchis, and my revisiting Charhar to investigate and report on these and other grievances* I left Bandar Abbas by S.S. ,, BARODA M on the 26th January and arrived at Charbar on the 29th January. I was fortunate in having Sultan Seyed Mohamed Khan Tayar, the newly appointed Officer Commanding and Deputy Governor of Charbar, as a passenger on board the steamer from Bandar Abbas to Charbar, so I was able to tell him of the reason of my visit, and discuss Charbar affairs in general. He was very friendly and gave me the impression of being a quiet, frank, sensible, just and tadful official, interested in his work, and he expressed his willingness to give me all possible assistance during my visit* We disembarked together and were met on shore by all the other Persian officials of the Port# 2. Immediately on my arrival, I sent messages to the Heads of the Khojas, Baluch, Hindu and Katri communities, informing them, that I was ready to interview any petitioners or others who had grievances* 3. I shall first deal with those, who sent in petitions and whose names you sent me, vide para*9 of your D.O* - Will you please refer to this list? No*l# Shah Dad son of Abbas» has left Charbar and gone to Gwadur, where he has settled* He is carrying on his business there, and is not likely to return* No*2* Shamoo son of Shiru. Ditto* No.3* Rahimdad is the Mullah of the Baluch Community* He and 21 other Baluchis submitted applications for renouncing Persian Nationality* They have been told that they cannot leave Charbar except on Persian Passports; these they are unwillingto accept, so the only thing, as I explained to them, was to wai - the result of Minister’s request to the Persian Government, to he informed as to which of the applications are accepted and which rejectedc These Baluchis do not possess any immoveable properties to speak of, and are willing to leave the country at any time, as they definitely refuse to accept Persian nationalit; A few of these complained of petty annoyances by the Raise- Nazmieh, and Mullah Rahimdad complained that he had been ordered to discontinue his religious work, but as a result of representations which I made to the Deputy Governor and Raise- Nazmieh, both have given assurances that he will be permitted to continue his work amongst his own community# Zawar Ali Mihroo* This man’s complaint was that he was not allowed to leave Charbar for Bombay. He is not on the lists of applicants who wished to renounce Persian nationality, which I submitted in February 1932, but sent in his application and necessary papers at a later date* He applied to the Raise- Nazmieh for a Jawazi - Iqamat, but this was not granted, as having been born in Charbar, he came under the Persian Nationalit; Law, and is considered a Persian Subject. He was informed by the Police, that he could leave Charbar for India on Persian travel papers (Passport) or proceed to either Gwadur or Muscat on a Persian Frontier permit (Qura Sarhadi). This has been explained to him* No*5* Sabzal* Complaint of annoyance by Vakil Hassan Nizami* Sabzal is one of the Imperial and International Communications Limited Line guards and is at present on line inspection in the district and not due to return to Charbar for another 3 months. The annoyance caused him was the Vakil’s threat to commandeer his donkey to chase a Baluch camelman, but as the line guard protested this did not happen - a complaint of no real importance* No*6* Munshi Abdur Rahman bin Mazar. This man is the Political Munshi at Charbar. He had some dispute over his passport, because of the Raise-Nazmieh doubting his nationality and refusing/3 refusing to visa it for the journey to Qwadur by sea, until such time as he produced papers to verify his nationality* He was however permitted to proceed to Gwadur by the overland route, which he did and where, he is at present on 4 months’ leave. The parentage form to verify his nationality will be duly completed on his return. No. 7. Gangal son of Faqir Mohamed Hyderabadi. His family were kidnapped by the Baluch outlaw Shiruk son of Dilmurad. Gangal was absent at the time at a village, some 6 miles distance from his house in Dashtiyari. He went after Shiruk with two Sayeds and by their influence and pleadings succeeded in obtaining their freedom for Rs.700/-. Shortly after the payment of the money, his shop was plundered and he lost gold and silver in ornaments and cash to the value of Rs.350/—• No.8* Lalcomal Gopaldas. Hindu merchant was robbed of money and goods to the value of Rials 5011/- when his shop was plundered by Baluchis at Sirgan in November 1933. No.9. Vishanmal. Hindu merchant residing at Sirgan, was i robbed by Baluchis of money and goods from his shop to the value of Rials 8722/-. This robbery took place in November 1933. 10. Lekhraimal. Hindu merchant was also robbed by Baluchis in November. His shop is in Dashtiyari, from where money and goods to the value of Rs.1452/12 and Rials-240/- were taken. The Baluch outlaws responsible for these robberies are:- (a) Shiruk son of Dilaurad. (b) Hashim son of Kis. (c) Nawab son of Nawazan. (d) Nadir son of ” (e) Yusuf Khan son of Mohamed Khan. (f) Beg Mohammed son of Pateh Mohamed, and these and their followers wander about the country between Dashteyari and Kasar Kand, about 75 miles north of Charbar. The/The Governor is fully aware of their robberies# and the reports that these persons have made to Bushire, as letters concerning these have been received from the Governor General# Bushire. it appears# however, that little or nothing can be done to recover these goods and money, until the outlews are captured and suitably dealt with* No*9 Vishanmal informed me that he had received a letter from Yar Mohamed and Mouladad, servants of Hussain Khan son of Seyed Khan# a Baluchi chief# who resides at Geh,in British Baluchistan, and who receives a yearly subsidy of Rs«500/- from the Imperial and International Communications Limited, informing him that a quantity of his and another Hindu’s (Shamoomal) goods had been recovered# and suggesting that he should return to Sirgan to take these over, but the Governor of Charbar, to whom he had also reported this# advised not to proceed, but to wait until the goods were sent to him at Charbar. In addition to these cases, the Katries report the under-mentioned robberies from their houses in Dashtiyari:- (a) Moosa son of Mohamed - robbed of goods and cash to the value of Rs.1650/-. (b) Hashim son of Katri - robbed of value of goods &lt; Ks.525/ and cash to the (c) Esa son of Allans - do* do. Rs.125/-. (d) Haji Ebrahim Katri do. do. Rs•600/-. (e) Noor Hassan son of Isa do. do* Rs•930/—• (f) Hassim bin Aroo - do. do. Rs. 54/-. (g) Yousif Ha;}i Sulaiman - do. do. Rs.120/-. The Baluch outlaw Hashim ibn Kia is reported to be responsible for this plundering* I have advised them to submit petitions to the Deputy Governor. Haji Ebrahim, the chief of the Katri Community informed me that several Katries had left Dashtiyari and gone to/to settle in Dasht (British Baluchistan), and that, he and the remaining few would he leaving soon, as they found it impossible to live in this country under present conditions# He asked, what should be done about his and other Katries 1 properties, also sums of money due them from different Persians^ I suggested that they should endeavour to sell their properties before leaving, or else appoint agents to do this or look after them, and collect the outstandings, as I feared that it was no concern of the Government how, or to whom, they disposed of their properties# 4# On the 31st I interviewed the Heads and senior membaoi of the Khojas, Baluch, Katri and Hindu Communities, who had come to see me. Haji Abdul Husein Hyderabad!, who is the Raise Tujar, also one of the wealthiest merchants and largest property owner, the expert on Charbar affairs, the 'brains' of all the different communities, and as he proudly describes himself, the 'right hand of the Customs and authorities', headed the deputation, and was spokesman# He first asked (1) what the position was with regard to the applications submitted last year, for the renunciation of Persian nationality# I explained the sorry business, and what the attitude of the Persian Government is at present, as outlined in Tehran circular despatch No#14 of 26th July 1933, and Minister*s letter No#236 of 10th December 1933, and informed him that information as to the decision taken on the applications was awaited from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to whom a note had been addressed My His Majesty’s Minister; (2) they next spoke about the question of disposal of immoveable properties, and I told them that the Minister had asked that special consideration of extended period of time may be shown to those persons who are required to leave the country, where they had difficulty in finding purchasers# 1 /I suggested to some of them, that as they had been in Charbar practically all their lives, and had lost all connection with India and were completely identified with Persia, it would perhaps be better if they remained Persian subjects, but all to a man answered that they would never accept Persian Nationality, and that they would clear out of the country, even though their applications were rejected* They would, of course, prefer that their applications are accepted, and that they be permitted to continue to live and carry on their business in Charbar but, if not, they would be quite prepared to leave* I pointed out that in this case they might not be able to dispose of their immoveable properties, but the shrewd and clever Haji smiled at this and said that he had bundles of letters of appreciation and thanks from 'highest Persians' at Tehran for valuable services which he, and his father before him, had rendered to the Persian Government, and he would use these, if necessary, when time came in the Adliyah at Tehran* Others who owned little or no immoveable properties were prepared to depart from Persia at any time, if required to do so* The decision of the Persian Government is therefore anxiously awaited with much interest by these persons, who have definitely decided not to accept Persian nationality* A few of them preferred to the acceptance by the Persians Government of applications from those in other parts of Persia, who had also renounced Persian nationality, when the Law first came into force, and they now consider it a grievance, great pity, and hardship that they were not informed and given the opportunity of doing the same at that time, instead of about a year later, and so having all these troubles now, which might have been saved, as well as a good deal of oppression to many persons* The following grievances were then/5./ 7. then put to me:- (a) that bona fide British subjects in possession of Jawaz-Iqamats were required by the Raise-Nazmieh to give Zamin (Security) whenever they left Gharbar to go to Gwadur, Muscat, or Karachi as the case may be# I explained that this was probably because of unheard and adjourned law suits, police charges, or debts contracted in the country, when security was usually required for their appearances when summoned, but they said that this was not the case, and that it was demanded from all British subjects; (b) that British subjects in possession of passports when visiting Muscat and returning to Charbar were often ed refused permission to land until they had proceed/to Karachi and obtained the necessary visa to enter Persia, from the Persian Consul there# I told them that this was the correct procedure, but it was generally overlooked at these smaller ports, in the Persian Gulf, where a fine of about 50 rials was imposed instead# They said that this was sometimes done and they would like it to continue as it was impossible to always proceed to Karachi on account of the great expense; apart from this it was a waste of time. (c) that the Raise-Mazmieh is suppressing the British passports of those not born in Persia, who applied for Jawaa- Iqamats, and that he would not issue these* (d) that holders of Muscat Passports and Nationality papers were not allowed to leave Charbar* (e) that there were several cases of commandeering of camels, donkeys, fishing boats, of thefts, and of intimidation by the Raise-Nazmieh. I assured them that I waild bring these to the notice of both the Deputy Governor and Raise-Nazmieh.5. I sent the letter of introduction given by the Governor General of Bushire, and which ypu forwarded me, to the Deputy Governor and asked him to appoint a day and time for me to call. He sent back a message to say that he would prefer to call on me first, and would do so that very evening. He came alone, and his visit lasted about two and a half hours, I discussed all these grievances and complaints (a,b,c d, and e, in para.4 above with him and he took them down on a slip of paper and promised to see and discuss them with the Raise-Nazmiah. 6. Two days later I returned his visit, and was delighted to meefthe Raise-Nazmieh, who must have been instructed to be present at my visit. After a little general discussion, the Deputy Governor referred to the complaints, which I had spoken aoout oo him, so I took up each one with the Raise-haJtmien and finally asked him why he was making all these difficulties, anci hardships for British subjects. He flatly denied most of them and made superficially pleasing excuses for others - the outcome however was, that he promised to do everything possible (keeping within the Bolice laws and Regulauions, of course) to assist these people, so that there would not be any further complaints. He promised to modify the (a) Zamin question (b) waive the necessity of Persian visas from Karachi (d) redress the hardships of the Muscati Passport holders (s) enquire into cases of commandeerings and thefts, and (c) look into the question of the delay in issuing Jawas-i-48Jn8'i to holders of British Passports, but this latter would take some little time as there were several faulty and contradictory statements made by applicants when completing the necessary declaration forms, and these he was compelledto forward to either the Adliyeh at Bandar Abbas or to Tehran for instructions as to their disposal, and orders were awaited. I Mentioned that the majority of the persons were illiterate and I thought that he would have to exercise a little more patience in making them understand things, just as I was obliged to do when they had to complete forms for me. I made him understand that every case had been very carefully examined by me and that nationalities had been verified, before the Passports had been issued; so there was no need for him to doubt their nationalities. He promised to give this matter attention. I attach a list of those persons whose passports are in the possession of the Raise-Nazmieh and I consider that some action should be taken to have instructions sent to him to issue the Jawazi-Iqamats, and return the passports to their owners. 7. I next discussed the question of the non-property owners, mostly Baluchis, who had renounced Persian Nationality, and asked why they were not being permitted by him to leave Persia. He saia, that having been born in Gharbar, they were considered Persian Subjects ana that he could not allow them to leave without instructions from higher authority. 8. A summary of the whole situation, as it presents itself to me is that there is a certain amount of uneasiness impatience, and nervousness amongst these who have renounced Persian nationality, due to not knowing whether they will be allowed to remain.in the country on British Passports, or be forced to leave, and this is likely to continue until some definite decision is given by the Persian Government. Prom what I can gather, the Raise- Nazmieh and his clerk who are reported to be hostile to British subjects and unwilling to do anything to assist them, are responsible for all the oppression and annoyances.10 . The former is deliberately intimidating them so as to compel them to accept Persian nationality. The Raise-Nazmieh (Chief of Police) gives me the impression of being a hard and difficult individual, without tact and discretion, unreasonable, and thoroughly unreliable. He is distrusted by all and is an unpopular ana disliked official, who is likely to create trouble and do more harm than good in a place like Charbar. I feel sure that he must be misrepresenting cases to Tehran. I think all Charbar would be delighted to hear of his transfer, if this could be arranged. 9. I have received your telegram No. 124. ’.That I wanted to know was whether the Persian Government would accept further applications now from persons desirous of renouncing Persian nationality, in view of the fact that the prescribed period for renunciation had expired 1st March, I think. Anyway, the few who approached me decided in the meantime to wait and see what the fate is of those who have already submitted their applications.Notes. Minute Paper. Register No. P. z. 3644/34.

It seems unnecessary to enter into the details of the difficulties experienced by British subjects at Charbar. It is the usual tale of petty persecution and official incompetence to which we have become accustomed in Persia, and the local British authorities are doing all tnat can be done to put matters right. It appears that most of the British subjects at Charbar are prepared to give up their immovable property and to leave Persia rather than be made Persian subjects under the Nationality Law. Their chief grievances are the delay in dealing with the petitions which they have addressed to the Persian authorities to/to be allowed to divest themselves of PeHdan nationality and the fact that, apparently pending a decision from Tehran on the question of their nationality, those who wish to denounce their Persian citizenship not as yet permitted to leave Persia. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has taken the matter up again with the Persian Government and requested them to expedite the issue of replies to the petitions, and the Persian authorities are at last beginning to take steps in the matter. It appears that it is just possible that those whose petitions are granted will not all be forced to leave Persia. Secretary, &amp; 0. Department | Secretary.

I have to ac&amp;nowledga the receipt of your despatch ho. 49/697 * of March 10th f 1934, enclosing a report by Captain Lincoln upon the difficulties in which British subjects and Britlah protected persons resident in Charb&amp;r are placed through the existing uncertainty regarding the aeoeptanee by the Persian Oorerment of their applications for the renunciation of paralan nationality. 2 # Z enclose a aestorandum In which I hare dsalt sei iatun with the points raised in Captain Lincoln's despatch, as well as s copy of s not# which I haws addressed to the parsian Government pressing for a reply to the petitions. 3s Captain Lincoln is to ba congratulated upon the manner in which he has conducted his mission to Char bar and especially upon his success in persuading the local authorities to make tha travel formalities sasler for British subjects and protected parsons desiring to leave Oharbar temporarily. 4« As regards the general question, X do not think the Persian Government really give the special meaning to the word t, foreign M attributed to them in your despatch. Their attitude seems to be as follows:* 'All persons declared to be Persian subjects by Article 1 (4) and ( 6 ) of the nationality Lav of /September The Honourable The politieal Resident In the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRRSeptember 7th, 1929$ who poeseesed a sacond nGtianality had the opportunity of renouncing their peraian nationality between October 31at 9 1950 (not 1939 9 aa in .^uahire despatch) the date of the suppleaentary Artielea 9 and uatober 91st, 1951* Those who did ao were recognised aa foreigners, no either aatter what their raee or religion end their wae no question* of their being foreed to relinquish thelf^innorsable property or of their leawing Persia* similarly, those persons affected by Article 1 (4) and (5) who reach the age of eighteen and haws at that time a second nationality nay still talcs advantage of Article II and renounce their Persian nationality 9 no natter what their race or religion* Nevertheless, when it was represented to us that certain paraons who considered then*elves foreigners had from Ignorance or carelessness omitted to take advantage of the Supplementary Articles, we said, in September 1958, that we would for a further short period consider sympathetically petitions submitted by such persons under Article Kill of the Law of September 7th, 1989, for permission to renounce their Persian nationality* £e intended this concession to apply only to those who owing to their raoe and religion could elearly never be assimilated to Persians and who wars unlikely in their own persona or in those of their children to make Persia their permanent home* Va are sorry if our failure to make this plain at the outset has eaused any inconvenience. In any case, in making this concession we were merely indicating in advance the way in whleh we would accept certain petitions. It is open to anyone at any tine to submit a petition under Article Kill and the petition will be treated as we, in the oasq&gt;leta discretion which wa raaarva to ouraalvea under Section ( 8 ) of that Artiola, think fit* if we acceptit, applioant mist, aosordlng to tUs tsrms of ths Artlols, disposs of His ImioYSstols property* but if ws eHooss to ssJcs the further ecmaition that he shell leere Persia we are within both the lav sad our rights in doing so* the petitions which we said we would consider under the 'oonoomulon* were no different from any other petitions in this respect* M 5* The concession only applied, of course, to the esteaeion of tlae* The attitude of the Persian Government towards the petitions of persons of Asiatie race and Mahamadan religion was of course inoonelstent with their original declarations, petty and unfrlandly, but I do not think it was illegal* It was admittedly aimed at persona who, while enjoying all the advantages of life In Persia, were ettempting to escape fro* the obligations Involved in military service. 6 * similarly, the interpretation of the Persian attitude given In the concluding paragraph of your despatch is not &lt;{alts the one which 1 should attribute to it myself* The statement of the Persian Government summarised in Mr* Mallet 1 a circular despatch Me* 14 of July 26th, 1965, covered those British subisots who submitted petitions under Article XIII* Escape from the Law was possible to those who took advantage of the ^fepplementary Articles and is still possible to those who take advantage of Article II (though I do not ear thak the Persian Government might not make difficulties in Individual eases) even if they were of Asiatic race or Muhaamedan religion* Bor do I think that Safeguard 16 would be an effective argument* The difficulty le that those who failed to take advantage of the Supplementary Articles are not, ace or ding to Persian Lav, British subjects at all, but Persian subjects, and before /recognisingrecognising tbw an aritlah subject, the J'nrnian Oornranent » ay Make what oondltionn It liken, even to the point of •spelling them from the country. •p # X an interested to learn that the petition* of some Britieh auteiecte et Bander Ahbae hare been accepted without their hawing to leave the ocxintryt but I do not think it would be fair to cite this example to the Persian Government, ae tha only result would prohahly be to have them turned out. &lt;j # 1 am forwarding copies of this despatch, with a copy of your despatch under reply and a copy of my despatch Ko* 856 of the 10th December, 1955, to hie Majesty f e principal secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (to. 167), s copy of this despatch and of my daapatoh Mo. 856 of the 10th December, 1955, to the Foreign ieoretary to tae Govern ment of India (Mo. 75), and a copy of this daspatch with the ordinary encloaurea to hia Majesty's consul at Kerman (Me. 6 ). 1 am.

Sir, With reference to Lieutenant Colonel Looh's despatch No. 111/8136 of October 14th, 1933, respecting the position of those British subjects resident st Charber who hawe submitted applications for the renunciation of Persian nationality under Article XIII of the Nationality Lew of 1929, I have to transmit to you, herewith, s copy of a note that I have addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affaire, asking for information as to the decisions taken on these applications. 2. The attitude of the Persian Government is at present that persons in this situation must either acoept their Persian nationality or leave the country, and I hardly think it likely that cases will arise in which they not only withhold permission for the renunciation of Persian nationality but also withhold permission for the person concerned to depart from Persia. In any case. It seems undesirable to suggest such a contingency to them at this stage. 3. As regards the question of property, I have added a paragraph to my note asking that special consideration may be shown in those cases where an applicant hae difficulty in finding a purchaser for his immoveable property. But I have no real hope that any practical result will be achieved. The Persian Government will, I fancy, adopt the quite logical standpoint that the terms of Article XIII are clear and that the conditions which they have attached to the acceptance of petitions under Article XIII ere elec clean that if there ar« persons who persevere with their petitions in the face of these terms and conditions those persons must be presumed to have /takentaken Into account the possibility that they sight find difficulty in disposing of their issoTeable properties; and that in any oase it is no concern of the Government how to whom 9 or for how such petitioners under Article XIII dispose of these properties.No. 2QQ.

According to this communication the Council of Ministers have had under consideration the general questioi of the petitions submitted by the British subjects and protected persons of Charbar and in particular my note No. 657 of December 10th, 1955, giving the names of sixty eight petltionerSf asking what decision had been taken in each case, and suggesting that those whose petitions were accepted should be given an extension of time in which to dispose of their Immoveable property (see my despatch No. 856 of December 10th, 1935). The Council of Ministers had dec 1 dad that these petitions might be accepted in principle, but did not feel able to acceded to my request for an extension of the time allowed for the disposal of immoveable property. The Prime Minister, who had given the head of the section hie orders in person, had said that the period of grace laid down by the law was one year and this could not be altered. /*.
