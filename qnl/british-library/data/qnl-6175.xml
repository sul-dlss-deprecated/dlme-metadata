There are a number of points that arise from this letter regarding Kadoo’s contract, leave, etc. 2. E.O. Contract . ladoo has no contract and in view of the F.O. remar!cs I suggest he be given one as soon as possible for three years with effect from. 1.4.49. I am drawing up a draft c ntract for both -ladoo and Mohsin and I suggest we refer this to the F.O. for approval when completed. 3. Salary . I cannot under stand how the F.O. arrive at a basic salary of Rs. 310. Kadoo commenced his service on 1.12.41 and on the present basis of Rs. 250 x Rs. 10 - Rs. 350. his basic salary from 1.4.49 should be Rs. 330^1.e. 7 years service to 1.12.48 plus one increment upon consolidation on 1.4.49.) 4. .Ye have already informed the Residency of this (see enc. 3 A) but I suggest we tatce it up with the F,0. direct. 5. Leave from 1,4.49 to 31.3.50 Ee will be entitled to the full annual 30 days for this period. He has already had 36 days leave during this leave year so has exhausted his present entitlement. The extra 6 days leave will count again st certain accrued leave due to him - see next paragraph . 6 . Leave prior to 1.4.49 The F.O. have agreed Tadoo can be allowed paid leave for the period 15.8.4^ to 31.3.49 at the rate he was entitled to under Government of India rules. Vhatthis entitlement is nobody here seems to Know. Israel held no contract during his Govt, of India service but from attached booK of ,f fundamental Rules ?t page 56, para 10A, it appears to be one twenty second of the period spent on duty. On this basis we have F.O. approval to allow Kadoo 27 days paid leave. However he has already had 6 days - see para 5 above. The rate of pay for the leave being that on the day the leave commences (see attached publication, page 57 para 16(1)(b).7 . This is about one half of the 60 days accrued leave Kadoo requested when a contract with the F.O. was first discussed with him (see paras 2 &amp; 3 of enc. 1A). It is not so much a question of his entitlement but rather who is to pay for the 35 days (i.e. 60 days less 27 days accepted by the F.O.). Here the JT.O. are not very helpful - para 2 of enc. 5A refers. We have no precedent to go by and do not thin^ the 33 days can be just struck off because no similar case exists. 8 . I thinx we should refer this point again lo the ?.0. but before so doing I propose to enquire from the Residency whether they have had a similar case. A draft letter is submitted for approval. 9. Rent Allowance Although this question was not I referred to the /.C./suggest we now tarce it up direct with them as the Residency, to whom we wrote(enc. 3 a), would undoubtedly prefer this. 10. As it is better to maxe our letter to the R.O. regarding i.adoo fully comprehensive I suggest we wait until we receive Bahrain's reply to our enquiry (para 8 ) before writing• CDMmssmmum ^onfi (lan Dial .

We thln^ that both Kadoo and Mohsin are entitled to these 33 days but no precedent has been established here in a similar case by which we can be guided as suggested by the Foreign Office. 5. ' Ve propose to pursue this question with the Foreign Office but before so doing we should be grateful if you would let us Know whether a similar case has arisen in Bahrain. 6. As the Foreign Office letter of 5th October 1949 also raises the question of ladoo’s salary and rent allowance - the latter being the subject of our letter No. 0/236(14/11) of 24th September, 1949 to you - we consider it would be preferable if we dealt with this matter direct with them also. ‘-e therefore propose to write them on the whole subject of Cadoo’s contract, salary, leave etc. as soon as a reply has been received from you to our enquiry at paragraph 5 above.

These employees were included in the list of staff submitted with Residency letter No. 127/2/49 of 31st -January for whom revised conditions of service were approved with effect from 1st April, 1949 (Netting f s letter 3303/91(5/49) of 4th April to Dredge refers). These conditions included one month f s leave and allowances per annum on full pay Normal Foreign Office rules do not permit locally engaged staff to accumulate leave i.e. to carry forward from one year to another, but in special circumstances we are prepared to leave this to the discretion of the head of the post. So far as the period prior to 31st March 1949 is concerned it should be noted that His Majesty’s Govern ment too^ over responsibility for the posts in the Gulf with effect from 15th August 1947, administration being in the hands of the Commonwealth Relations Office up to 31st March 1943, after which date the Foreign Office assumed responsibility. It 'was agreed at the time of the transfer of power thao temporary staff employed in the Gulf who were tai-cen over by His Majesty’s Government should retain their existing conditions of service. It follows therefore that from the period 15th August 1947 to 31st March 1949 Haddo and Mohsin were entitled to leave at the rates they enjoyed while in Government of India service.

Please refer to your letter of the 18th July, 1949, reference 127/5L/49, regarding Kadoo’s salary. 2. Kacioo comiiienced his service on the 1st December, 1941, and on the existing basis his salary from the 1st April, 1949 should have been Rs.330, i.e. 7 years service up to the 1st December, 1948, plus one incre ment unon consolidation on the 1st April, 1949. The net effect of this would be an increase of Rs.35. 3. However, this presupposes that when Kadoo was first engaged ne would have entered at the minimum of the scale for his grade. This is not a correct assumption since his background and qualifications would have warranted a cciaraencing salary higher than Rs.25C. 4. I appreciate your remarks that the Foreign Office would be averse to increasing the salary scale; but Kadoo's request is for his rent allowance to be increased to Rs.200. Rents in Kuwait v/ere specifi cally referred to ir Johnson^ letter No.127/2/49 of the 31st January, 1949, end the Foreign Office are therefore aware that the rent allowances n bear little relation to current prices.” The position has worsened since then, as you may have seen from para 300 of our intelligence summery No.16. 6. I do not think the solution is to recommend Kadoo f s salary be raised to Rs.350 although I would be prepared to do this. Kadoo may be willing to accent the increase of Rs.60 which would accrue on the present basis if Ms salary was increased to Rs.350, but this would mean that he had to mark time until the 1st April, 1951, before he became eligible for consideration for another increment. Even then none may be forthcoming because the position of Senior Interpreters with more than 10 years 1 service has still to be considered. In that time Xadoo r s liabilities might have increased but he would have not have received sn increment. 6. I therefore consider that Xadoo's salary should be increased to Rs.330 with retrospective effect from the 1st April, 1949; and that the Foreign Office be asked to increase his rent allow ance to Rs.200 from the same date. 7. I think it is important to fight this case on the particular allowance in question since I am not in favour of increasing basic salary to meet an increased cost of rent. Indeed, this could react to the disadvantage of the Foreign Office. J.A.F. Gethin, Esq., Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.&lt;**04 CA^i/*lodUkl Ifycm Jut fy^j PERSIAN GT \ T GT BAHRAIN. CONFIDENTIAL.

In it rupees are mistakenly referred to as rials. 2. The scale recommended by Johnson for Senior Interpreters and accepted by the Foreign Office is Rs.250 x 10 to Rs.350 per month. Kadoo says he has nine years' service and if this is correct his basic pay should have been fixed at Rs.340 and not Rs.310. If you recommend it, on the stren gth of the enclosure I am willing to fix his basic pay at this point or even at Rs.350 though this will only give him a maximum increase of Rs.60 a month. It will be difficult to persuade the Foreign Office to give him anything more though we shall have I think to ask them to agree to further increments for Senior Interpreters af ter 10 years service. When you reply would you kindly let us know exactly how much service Kadoo has ? Political Resident &gt; in the Persian Gulf. G.N. Jackson, Esq Jackson, Esq., M.B.E., Political Agent, Kuwait.^ COPY . FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. (XS 03/91K11(7/49) CONFIDENTIAL . 27th June, 1949. Dear Residency Please refer to Dredge's letter 48/57/49 of the 2nd May, 1949 to Netting about Kadoo's emolu ments. - a It is noted that in his letter of the 26th March to the Political Agent Kuwait, Kadoo asks for a rent allowance of 200 rials per mensem, and as the recently approved scales for locally engaged staff provide a rent allowance of 100 rials it would appear that a further increase of 200 rials would be exces sive even by Kadoo’s standards. Having agreed so recently to your recommendations for local scales we find it extremely difficult to approve further increases in individual cases. You could, if you think he deserves it, place Kadoo at a higher point in the scale with a corresponding increase in dearness allowance, but we feel that any case for more gene rous treatment would have to be demonstrated by reference to the inadequacy of the scales of pay and/or dearness allowances as a whole rather than on an indi vidual basis. ivJUi O “ V X ^ ESTABLISHMENT AND ORGANISATION DEPARTMENT.

D«*r Eit«bll#h«ent A: Orfanisetlcn Department, As you are aware we have two locally engaged Arab staff here, Mr. Israel Kaddo, the Interpreter and Sir. Abdul MohsIn, the passport clerk. 2. When the Foreign Office took over this post mi the 1st April, 194&amp; the new terma and conditions of service for such staff were not known and It was not until October, 194S that Mr. Kaddo and Mr. Mohair saw the new Foreign Office con* ditiona. They stated on the 3rd October, 1946 that they were prepared to accept the condition but wished the 60 days leave that they had accumulated during the two yetra of Government of India service prior to their absorption by the Foreign Office to be allowed to them or, failing that, for payment to be made in lieu. We consulted the Hesidency at Bahrain idio agreed that they were both entitled to the 60 days accumulated leave but the Residency pointed out that a grant of pay in leiu of leave was not permissible. 4. Ho forrtal contract was entered into and no letters were exchanged with either Mr. Kaddo or Mr. Mohsin in respect of tbelr employment with the Foreign Of flee 5 and it is difficult to know exactly from what date they came under 4 he Foreign Office conditions. W# consider that as they signified their agreement to the new conditions in October, 1948 they should be regarded as subject to such conditions as from the 1st of that month and that for the period from the 1st April, 1948 to 30th September, 1948 they should be regarded as being subject to the conditions applying to their temporary service with the Government of India. This is similar to the position of the Indian staff here who, until the new Foreign Office contracts were given them on the 1st June, 1948 were subject to Govermrent of India conditions although raid by the Foreign Office. 6 . We are anxious to regularise their position and we should be glad if you could accept liability for the 60 days accumulated leave based on the mean of their salaries for the two years Immediately prior to the 1st October, 1948. 6 . It would appear that of this 60 days leave three quarters (i.e. from 1st October, 1946 to 31st March, 1948) is chargeable to tha Government of India and one quarter (from 1 st April to 30th September, 1948) is chargeable to the Foreign Office. You will pernaps approach the Government of India regarding this liability. 7. Mr. Kaddo and Mr. Mohaln are aware that it is consi dered ths?t they are entitled to this leave and had it been possible to allow them the leave previously the matter would have been raised earlier, but our eomrlete inability to find temporary replacements, a necessity in this post in the case of long periods of leave, prevented this.

In March, 1949 Mr* Kendo requested three rorths 1 leave (i*e* 6fi days accmmilated leave ulus 3f days under Foreign Office conditions). This was allowed but we were tweble to find a suitable replacement for him &amp;nd finally he was given 36 days leave from the 26th Jure. 1949 to 31st July, 194©. fio replaceuient was ergared for this period. &amp;r. iohsia also asked fer lorg leave. This yas deried to his- also as no taseporary replacement could be obtained. He w*«t f however t allowed ten days leave in July, 1949. 11 . If it is agreed th$t these men are subject to Foreign Office conditions with offset from the let October, 1948 as suggested, then 30 days of Mr, Kaddo’s leave and Mr. Mohsln 1 * ten days leave aay count against their annual allowance for the ^riod let October f 1943 to 30th September, 1949.
