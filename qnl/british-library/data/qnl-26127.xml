It was proposed in the Financial Memorandum on the separation of Aden from India that the treasury balance should be adjusted at the close of business on the 31st March 1937 to its nonnal figure through the currency chest. There is no objection however to the treasury balance to be taken over by Aden on 1st April 1937 being somewhat larger or smaller than the normal balance. The actual balance received will be taken into account in the financial settlement.

As it has been proposed that l should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, and adding- remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Reilly. India office, London.ffw ( 'VdL^u ( Point Treasury and Finance . I understand that it is the practice in most Colonies for the budget to he brought forward annually by a Chief or Colonial Secretary. This appointment does not exist in Aden at present, and will not exist unless the Administration is reorganised on a Colonial model. I have therefore proposed the appointment of a Treasurer, and I understand that this suggestion was accepted at the 1933 meeting. At that meeting Mr. Cowell said that he would enquire of the Personnel Division of the Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would, be necessary to offer. If the transfer of Aden is to take place in the early part of next year, I consider that the selection of a Treasurer should be made as soon as possible, to enable him to take up his duties immediately on Aden becoming a Colony. I further suggest that the officer selected be sent to Aden on special duty some months prior to the transfer to study the financial position of the new Colony and to assist in the preparation of its first budget. With regard to the latter I shall make some further remarks later in this note. charge of the Income Tax and Salt and Excise Departments as well as of the Treasury. This would place him in control of all the Goverrment Revenue and Expenditure Departments of the I have suggested that the Treasurer should be inColony and might involve some rearrangement in the existing Superior posts of these Departments. The duties of Treasury Officer and of Collector of Salt and Excise are at present performed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner, an Officer on Rs.500-50-750 a month, who also performs magisterial and administrative duties* Both he and the Income Tax Officer are now nearing their time of retirement. I suggest that the Extra Assistant Commissioner’s appointment be revised and re-named, and that it be filled by a junior Colonial Office official, whose duties will be mainly magisterial and who would, as far as possible, be relieved of some of the other work now performed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner. A whole-time Income Tax Officer, however, will still be necessary though he would work under the control of the Treasurer. These are points on which I shall be glad to have the advice of the new Treasurer, which is an additional reason for my request that he should be sent to Aden in advance of the transfer to look into the present system of working these Departments and to advise on any changes that might suitably^ be jade in them^54 5k 1955 j 30th August, 1933- ;3°1' My dear Laithwaite, With reference to our discussion with Reilly on tne questions connected with the transfer of the Aden Administration, I enclose a copy oi a letter which I h°ve sent to him regarding the salary we shall probably have to pay for a Treasurer.

( ^ t x Dee.r Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 6. Treasury and Ninanae . If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will have its separate financial arrangements and separate budget, and this will probably necessitate the strengthening of its financial staff by the appointment of a Treasurer, who might also control the Income-tax and Salt &amp; Excise departments. This is a matter which will require careful consideration by the new administration. I should be strongly opposed to the appointment of any new officials who are not absolutely necessary, and the new organisation ought to be carried out as economically as possible.AL. * .*rt i ) J t (The references in the note feelov? are to the points raised in Colonel Rei-H^s tad-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly’s d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell nf “Mop PoT/%vs&lt;? qJ H-P-f-J piv l^fpl + nn p'nH My*. '^aif,}Mclit6 6. Treasury and glnance. Mr. Cowell indicated that if Aden became a Crown Colony the colonial administration would be responsible for the annual preparation and sutmlsslon of a budget. Colonel Reilly stated that the financial staff was noV at the moment very strong and that what he had In mind was that on the separation of Aden a gazetted officer should be appointed as Treasurer. He should also be in charge of the Income Tax and Salt and Excise Departments. He was opposed to placing any heavier burden on the finances of the new colony than could be avoided, but part at any rate of the expenses of the official in question might be met by the suppression of existing posts whose duties would in future be performed by him. Thus, it might be possible to abolish the existing Income Tax Officer. Mr. Cowell said that he saw no difficulty in providing an official of the necessary status! rom the Colonial Service. The type of man wanted would probably be a good Assistant Treasurer in a large colony who would in the ordinary course be able to hope for appointment as Treasurer in a large colony. He would enquire of the Personnel Division of the Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would be necessary to offer. Colonel Reilly emphasised that it was Important to select for tills post a man of experience and some strength of character, who could assist the Resident In rejecting doubtful demands from units of the Aden^32 Hrt^ 8 ' T' u V.— Finance. The Government of India maintain a Treasury at the Crater. The total receipts during the year 1931-32 amounted to Rs. 59,53,181-1-9 and the expenditure to Rs. 59,71,597-2-10, the closing balance being Rs. 2,28,709-3-10. The chief sources of Government revenue are Salt, Excise, Income-tax and Stamps. The details of transactions are shown in Appendices V to VI1I-A. There is a sub-treasury at Kamaran.
