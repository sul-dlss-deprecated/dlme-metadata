My dear Walton, Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No. P.Z. 5673/35, dated the 29th August 1935? The Government of India have no objection to the grant of an extension of the tenure of Reilly’s employment as Chief Commissioner Aden as you propose. If he is required to remain at Aden after he reaches the age of superannuation he will be retired from the Army but will continue in his present appointment at His Majesty’s pleasure. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.G. Acheson. To J.C. Walton, Esquire, C.B., M.C., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, LONDON.AIR MAIL. P.Z. 5673/35. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 29th August, 1935. My dear Acheson, As you know, Reilly will have completed five years as Resident at Aden next February, and in March 1937 he will be 55 years of age. You will no doubt agree that it is very desirable that Reilly should continue at Aden to see through the transfer from the control of the Government of India to that of the Colonial Office. He himself is not only willing but quite anxious to do so. I have mentioned the matter to Metcalfe, who personally agrees, and have discussed it informally with the Colonial Office. They are very desirous of retaining Reilly’s services for the transitional period before and after transfer. The Colonial Office, therefore, would not only not object, but would be extremely pleased if Reilly, as an Indian service officer, could continue to hold his present post beyond the expiry of his five years, and until such time as transfer takes place. J.G. Acheson, Esq., C.I.E., It/ Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department.It is expected, I understand, that provincial autonomy will come into being about April 1937, and this would seem to be the most convenient date also for the transfer of Aden. You will remember that Sir Samuel Hoare stated in the House of Commons on 9th April 1935 that '‘it is our intention to bring the change into operation at or about the same time as provincial autonomy”. If for any reason the date of provincial autonomy, and consequently of transfer, were retarded for a brief period beyond the end of March 1937, it might be necessary to relax the 55- year rule for a month or two in Reilly’s favour, but presumably this does not constitute a serious obstacle. On transfer taking place the Colonial Office would appoint Reilly as the first Governor, he would thus be in charge both before and immediately after transfer to supervise the manifold practical arrangements, small and great, which have to be made to ensure a smooth transition. Could you very kindly let me know as soon as possible whether you agree, so far as the Government of India are concerned, to Reilly remaining at Aden until the date of transfer? With reference to Metcalfe's letter of 11th May and to the Government of India’s express letter of 9th August/August, there will apparently be plenty of time to consider the practical details of the administrative change, if it does not take place till the date of provincial autonomy. The Colonial Office, I understand, contemplate consideration of these details, perhaps by a small committee, when Reilly is at home next summer and this would appear to be the best procedure. Meanwhile we can go on preparing the material for such consideration. In a letter to Fraser-Tytler of 25th August 1933 I enclosed a note of an earlier tentative discussion. Perhaps you could let me have in due course the information which will be required from the Government of India on two points (Nos. 2 and 4) in that note. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.C. Walton.V/'-- /o ^ C**- c Ia/S Vlv fa ? 17th December, 1935. 4 Dear Croft, I should be grateful if you would kindly let me know whether you concur in the enclosed draft of a letter which I propose to send to Wigram asking for approval of the proposal that Sir Bernard Reilly’s term of office as Resident Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief at Aden should be extended to the end of March,1937. Yours sincerely. W. D. Croft, Esq.,C.I.E.■&gt; ( D R A F T. O December, 1535. Dear Wigram, In February,1931, the King approved the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel B.R. Reilly,C.I.E., O.B.E., (now Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Bernard Reilly,K.C.M.G.,C.I.E., C.B.E.) as Resident Chief Cominissioner and Cominander—in— Chief at Aden. The normal term of appointment for this post is five years and Sir Bernard Reilly’s tenure will terminate on the 17th April,1936. As you are no doubt aware, provision is made in the Government of India Act,1935, for Aden to be separated from British India and for arrangements for regulating the civil administration thereafter to be made by Order—in- Council. The date provisionally fixed for the transfer of Aden from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is the 1st April,1937. It is greatly to be desired that Sir Bernard Reilly, Col. The Rt. Hon. Lord Wigram,G.C.B.,G.C.V.O.,C.S.I.1 who has given excellent service in Aden and has the 9 iost intimate knowledge of the territory and its administration, should continue to be in charge of affairs at Aden during the transitional period, that is, both before and after the transfer is effected. As a first step it is necessary to make arrangements covering the period up to the end of March,1927, and Mr. Thomas will be grateful if you will be so good as to ascertain whether the King approves the extension of Sir Bernard Reilly’s appointment as Resident Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief at Aden from the 18th April,1936, to the 31st March,1937. Both the Government of India and the Secretary of State for India agree to this proposal. It is the Secretary of State’s intention to propose Sir Bernard Reilly’s appointment as the first Governor of Aden when it has become a Colony on transfer, but this is a matter which will be taken up at the appropriate time.

Fwufa, EEgECI^i Secretary to the sir&gt; FV APR 1532 Government of India. With reference to the correspondence ending with the Secretary of State T s telegram of che 23rd April 1931, Ho.1343, I Po C.O.d/- 29.9.31 (para.l) ( w .ei)cfe)aiii directed to enclose a copy of From ' ' 11.12.31 (paras .1 &amp; 2 &amp; end,) I correspondence exchanged between To, G. of Bom. d/- 5.1.331 (parall) From G. of Bom. d/- 26.2.32 (para^l) the Government of Bombay, the Accourt ant General, India Office, ana the Colonial Office on the subject of the emoluments paid to Lieut.-Col. heilly for the period from 26th March to 17th April 1931. 2 . It will be observed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies is not prepared to accept liability for £79.3.9 in respect of the pay drawn by Col.Reilly as Resident during this period, on the ground that his substantive appointment took effect from 18th April-,1931, and that until that date he should have drawn officiating pay. The Government of Bombay however contest the Colonial Office view on the ground that Col. Reilly did in fact perform the duties of Resiaent alone from March 26th and that Lieut.-Col. Wightwick received charge of the duties of First 4000 8/31 Assistant Resident from the :214a damesame dat e • 3. Whatever arrangements were actually made locally at the time it appears to the Secretary of State impossible to avoid the conclusion that in view of the terms of the Colonial Office Despatch to the Resident dated the 13th April,1931,(of which a copy was sent to you in the weekly letter dated 16th April), as amended by Colonial Office telegram of the 21st April Do.17 (copy sent in the weekly letter dated 30th April), Lieut.Col. Reilly was only entitled to draw pay as Resident on and from April 18th 1931. If any local arrangements were made before the receipt of definite information as to the date of Sir Stewart SymeS T vacation of the post, they should have been adjusted on receipt of the Despatch and amending telegram. 4. In these circumstances the Secretary of State assumes that the Government of India will agree with him that it would be fruitless to contest the matter further with the Colonial Office, and would be glad to learn in due course the action taken by them in the matter (64.) J. C. WALTON.A.G. No. 3645/32. Referred to Political Secretary. 17th March, 1932. For observations on the first paragraph of the attached letter from the Govt, of Bombay dated 26th February. The point seems to be not what Lt. Col. Reilly was actually doing but rather what he should have been doing, and when the Colonial Office letter vide flag A was received it appeared that that Department's view was incontestable. If Sir S. Symes was entitled to enjoy leave from the appointment up to 17th April,1931, the appointment of Lt. Co. Reilly prior to and including that date ought presumably to have been on an officiating basis only. This Department's letter to the Govt, of Bombay is flagged B. Incidentally the leave salary due to Sir S.Syipes for the period of leave in question has not yet been paid, vide e.g. the latest statement from India with A.G. 3352/32 below. The reason for this is not apparent but presumably the officer's claim will be settled ultimately. (sgd) R.A. Janes. Accountant General. I should have thought therefcould be no possible doubt about this matter. Col. Reilly was definitely appointed Resident from April . 1 3th. 1931 (C.O.Despatch of 13th April 1931 P.Z.2270/31,corrected by C.O. telegram of 21st April, P.Z.2573/31). Furthermore the Government of India were informed (telegram of 23rd April No.1343,P.Z.2357/31) that Sir Stewart Symes was entitled to leave terminating on 17th April. The Govt./—Govt, of Bombay do not explain why Col. Wight iagfe received charge on the 26th March, but it would seem that a mistake was made, or that action was taken prematurely, and that the matter should now be adjusted. Presumably, in practice, the -taking over charge was a mere formality, and that from the time when Sir S.Syraes went on leave Col. Reilly was in fact doing the Resident’s job and Col. Wightinch was in fact doing the 1st Asdibant’s job. There does not seem to be any case for pressing the Colonial Office to revise their View - as presumably it is not possible to pay two Residents at the same time. It seems hard on Col. Reilly, if it means that a recovery would be made from him, but there is no doubt that he was infoimed definitely of the date of his appointment. (sgd) H.C. Walton. 2 2.3.32 The Political Secretary. 23rd March, 1932.. I suggest that the necessary communication to the Govt, of Bombay or the Govt, of India as the case may require should issue from the Political Dept, as the matter^ has advanced beyond the stage of an adjustment with the Colonial Office and become one of status involving the possibility of recovery of pay.

I had a most pathetic letter yesterday from Archer (Sir Geoffrey Archer) who, as you know, was Governor of the Sudan, imploring me to put in a word with you for him to be made Resident at Aden, and I feel that I must at any rate let you know that he is very keen on getting the job. correspondence he has had with my Secretary of State, in which he asked, to be considered for the appointment and was told that this time the India Office had the giving of it. very difficult task set him in the Sudan, but our difficulty in employing him is that it is not very easy to put him into a first-class Governorship, in view of the fact that he was not considered good enough in His letter to me is the result of some I am sorry for Archer, as I think he had a the'^1 the Sudan, and of tne bad. effect it would have in the Colonial Service if we were to take him back after what happened to him under the Foreign Office, wnicn is more or less generally known.

Commissioner in Somaliland and later Governor of that Trotectorate: and during eight years tenure of this office I was in close touch with suc cessive Residents and kept au courant with Aden affairs. 3. After being summoned to attend the kiddle East Conference in 1921, I was instructed by the Secretary of State for the Colo nies to submit proposals in collaboration with kajor General T.E. Scott for the transfer of Aden from the Government of India to and gave me an insight into the finances and machinery of Govern ment there. And, finally, while Governor General of the Sudan, I had every opportunity to follow the affairs of Aden, both politi Colonial Office Control, which entailed a residence of some months The Permanent Under Secretary Of State, India Office.2 - 11/2/31 cai and commercial, and study Red 5ea trade conditions general ly, including the question of Abyssinian trade and the receht growth at Jibouti as a distributing and shipping centre in com petition with Aden. I think therefore I aay properly lay claim to some special qualifications - in a knowledge of the people, the language and local conditions - which would be of value in the appointment I seek. 4* I resigned my post as Grovernor-General of the Sudan in 1926 after a difference of opinion with my advisers and owing to ill-health: copy of the official statement is attached. In 1928 the Secretary of State for the Dominions offered me the appointment of Governor of Newfoundland, which for financial and other reasons I was unable to accept . For one thing I felt that my training and experience fitted/Inn rather for a post in volving native administration. 5. I am now extremely anxious, at the age of 48, and again in good health, to be nominated to the post of Resident at Aden and I hope that the Secretary of State for India may favourably consider this application.
