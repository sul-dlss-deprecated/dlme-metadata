Russian Government obtained an agieenient with Persia to construct a line from Meshed to Seistan. Early m Pdo] the Centra! Persia Telegraph line had been completed lorn ivashau ' the junction point with the Bushire—Teheran line) to a point 144 miles east of Kerman ; beyond this the route had not been decided on. Simultaneously the Government of India had been constructing a telegraph line lioni Qm'tta to Robat (for Colonel MacMahon’s Arbitration Mission). To link up those t \(0 permanent lines a temporary connection was made and completed in May 19(*4, but was little used except for a few telegrams to or from the British Consul at Kerman. Robat- Seistan Line. The Government of India wanted to continue the Quetta Robat line to oeist.au, wheic Colonel McMahons Mission was, but Persia, under the influence of Russia, would not agree. i ho decision that the route of the Central Persia telegraph line should follow tiie route of the temporary line having been come to in May DOG, the Persian portion of that line was finally completed in November 1907. Consequent on the signing of the Anglo-Russian Convention in August 190&lt;, Russian opposition to the. construction of the Robat-Seistau line ceased. In the course of the following negotiations wdth Persia for the construction of the Robat-Seistan line, the Foreign Oflice were informed in the letter of 19th dune 1907 (Political 9d2 A), oi which a copy is attached, that “if the material now lying at Robat should eventually be handed over to the “ Persian Covemmeut at less than the rate list value, the loss on the transaction should be divided between the British and Indian Exchequers. But, the stores being already at Robat, no claim would be made on the British Exchequer in respect of their carriage to that place.” I he instructions contained in the telegram of (&gt;th July 1907 to the British Minister at ieheran (copy at tael red) state the conditions on which the Persian Government were to be asked to agree to the construction of the line by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. • Ihe terms ol the proposed agreement were submitted to the Persian Covetnment carl) in 1913, and that Government were then informed that the cost of the line w'as estimated at 6,300/.

I he agreement has been signed by the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and awaits ratification by the British Minister at Teheran (P.W. 1204/10). It contains the pledges desired, to P ) Gleet that the line will never he made over to any Foreign Government ^ompany other than British and that none but Persians or British suaii be employed on it. i’he Persian Government were originally informed that the* estimated cost of the line wms 0,300/ ; the actual cost now submitted to them is 0,774/.
