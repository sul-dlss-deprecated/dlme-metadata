The buoy in question was found too sma l, and a buoy was therefore obtained by the “ Georgiana from the village of Gusbah, whose inhabitants had picked it up some four yeais betoie. , Writing on the 2Hrd July, 18G3, to the Chief Secretary to the Government of^ Bombay, Lieutenant-Colonel Belly explains that he took the above action m anticipa tion of'orders of Government, as the existing buoy had sunk and to have delayed action pendino- reference to Government would have been to risk another grounding o The superintendent of marine, Bombay, reported to Government in August of the same vear that the above orders by Lieutenant-Colonel Belly anticipated directions sent by him to the commander of the “ Georgiana ” to replace the buoys and beacons at Bushire and the Shatt-el-Arab. _ t • + + It appears clear that there were normally two buoys in the anchorage, as Lieutenant- Colonel kelly, in November 1863, in a letter to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, remarks that if a new buoy is sent up for the Shatt-el Arab the buoy at present there cc could then be laid down at the entrance of the Bushire roads. At present there is a buoy only on one side of the fairway into those roads. In 1865 one of these buoys drifted out of position, and was relaid by the residency schooner in its proper place on the 9th April, 1866. In 1870 one of these buoys was carried away “from the outer roads ; the Government of Bombay sent up a buoy to replace it. In 1873 it was reported that “ the Government buoys marking the entrance to the port ” were in need of repairs, which were shortly afterwards effected by His Majesty s ships. In 1873 one Abdul Aziz-bin-Jasim, who describes himself as a Government pilot, writes ta Colonel Boss stating that he was constructing minaret for the purpose of a lighthouse for the convenience of ships, and asking for a lantern and a supply of oil for use thereon, but it does not appear from the record what action, if any, was taken thereon, though the proposal was referred to the shipping companies and to the commander of one of His Majesty’s ships for an expression of their views. In 1879 both the outer and inner buoys were found to be defective, but the Government of Bombay ruled that they were not to be replaced at the expense of Government, and the British India Steam Navigation Company also refused to be responsible for them. In 1883 the Government of India in the Foreign Department wrote that it was not at present the intention of Government to replace the buoys in the Bersian Gulf, but sanctioned the repair of the existing buoys at the expense ot Government; a Marine Department resolution, dated the 25th July, 1883, confirmed the decision of Government not to provide new buoys. In 1900 the local authorities were approached in the matter by Colonel Talbot, apparently for the first time, the governor being requested to- co-operate in the relaying ,of a new buoy at the inner anchorage, which was eventually done on the 24th November, but by an officer of the “ Lawrence.” The governor was duly informed of what had been done, and promised to issue the necessary orders to fishermen, &amp;c., not to interfere with the buoys. In 1901 another buoy was laid by His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx” on the west end of Lafkah reef, close to the spot which was occupied until recently by an iron beacon. In March 1902 the “ Lawrence” placed a buoy at the outer reef, and in informing the resident of the fact complained that two buoys previously laid in the same position had disappeared, and requested that orders on the subject might be issued by the local Bersian authorities. The governor was accordingly verbally asked on the 2nd April to warn nakhodas and others not to interfere with the buoys, and promised verbally to do do so ; he suggested^ however, the expediency of our making the buoys distinctive so that they could be identified if stolen, and added that there were no Bersian port authorities in Bushire who could look after such matters. On the 13th January, 1903, B.I.M.S. “Lawrence” laid an iron buoy in the inner anchorage, but the Bersian authorities do not appear to have specifically been informed. In March 1904, as a result of pressure by the Bussian Government, who proposed themselves to place buoys and erect lighthouses in the Bersian Gulf, the Shah was induced to order from Bussia a number of buoys to be laid at various points in the leisian Gulf. On the amval of the buoys they were claimed by the Bussian consul- general as the property of the Bmsian Government, but this claim was not admitted bythe Customs, who made no use of the buoys for some time, as it was found that they were unsuitable for use in open water. Eventually, however, in September 1904 several of them were laid in the fairway channel of the harbour; within twelve months several of them had disappeared and were not replaced, and by 1905 it appears that none remained. A similar fate attended those laid on the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab by the ^Customs Department. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to recall that one of the items, which, in a personal communi cation to you when in Calcutta, I included in a list of desiderata which, I considered, should be sought from the Persian Government by friendly means as opportunity offered, was the general recognition of our prescriptive right to control buoyage and lighting in the Gulf. 2. On the one hand, it seems possible that a suitable opportunity for obtaining this recognition (which we have already sought from the Porte) may occur in the early future in connection with the grant of a fresh loan to Persia ; on the other hand, there are some grounds to fear that if we are not soon in the field with a friendly demand in the direction referred to, we may be baulked from making it by some pretentious communication from the Persian Government on the subject of lights or buoys in their waters. 3. I have specific reasons for this apprehension in that at a recent meeting with the Governor of the Gulf Ports (Mowaqqer-ed-Dowleh), His Excellency asked me the facts regarding the reported erection of a light-house at Tamb, and the location of lighted buoys at Bushire; he enquired, at the same time, what decision had eventually been arrived at in the case of the proposed light-house on Shaikh Shuaib. None of these topics had previously been touched upon between us. • As regards Tamb, I informed him that, with the concurrence of the Shaikh of Shargah, we were about to put up a light there to facilitate navigation. The only remark His Excellency had to make in this connection was to say that there was no doubt that the island properly belonged to Persia and that they had to thank the blatant action of the Customs in 1904 for spoiling their case m regard thereto I rejoined that we considered, on the other hand, that it was beyond doubt that the Shaikh of the Jowa^of Oman owned the island and as m dealing with this question we had to reckon with patent facts, it seemed waste of time for us to discuss the question now. As regards the lighted buoys, I informed him that I understood that our Marine authorities dU intend to place gas buoys at the two anchorages, m order to improve the ^doinranfaSkTad donek J case of other buoys laid for the benefit of navigation in the Gulf. -iii UrrVii- -fm’ oiVh Shuaib I said that I had heard no moTawTt and suppTed theldea had been given up, * he P 0 ut £2 000 iTder- He said “What would such a light-house cost to erect, only about £2,000 stand ? ” I replied Nearer £9,000. Then we went on to other subjects.

With reference to the letter of this Office dated the 2nd Qcto- ber 1 1912, regarding the proposed erection of a lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaih Island, I am directed by the Marquess of Creive to inform you that, while he is not prepared to assent to all the detailed objections set out in the telegram of the Government of India, he accepts their conclusion that His Majesty 9 s Government should endea vour to obtain a concession which would, allow a British Lighthouse to be built at their own cost and. to he worked entirely by themselves Th,e concession should take if possible the form of a lease of a site by the Persian Government for 99 years, an assurance being at the same time given that it is not intended to fly the British flag on the lighthouse or to infringe in any way the rights of Persian sovereignty.

M -IFrom Viceroy, 27th September 1912. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 23rd August. Sheikh Shuaib Island Lighthouse. We consider Persian memorandum objectionable both in principle and in details. In principle we regard it essential to keep lighting and buoying of Gulf entirely in British hands. If we now admit Persian lighthouse how can we exclude Turkish rights as laid down in memorandum of 18th July 1912 ? In details we see objections to following points in Persian memorandum as being either incompatible with our position in Gulf, or futile. Article L:—Words “Persian Government authorise” seem inappropriate. Article II. :—It is idle to submit to Persian Government plans and estimates. Article III. :—The words “ temporarily ” and “ for convenience sake,” and “ Anglo-Indian officers ” are objectionable. Article V., Article VI., Article VII., Article VIII. are inappropriate. Article IX.:—There appears to be no need for a lighthouse to fly a flag. There is already a Persian flag on the island. If a concession could be obtained on which we could build a British lighthouse to be paid for and worked entirely by ourselves, there would be no objection. But while recognising desirability for shipping purposes of a lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaib Island we should prefer to defer construction till a more favourable time, rather than accept it on any such terms as would prejudice our position in Gulf vis-d-vis Turkey and other Powers. Possibly with change of Foreign Minisier at Tehran Persian Government may now be disposed to consider the question of concession.TREATY SERIES. No. 5. CONVENTION- BETWEEN 1902.

With the view of securing uninterrupted communication be tween Europe and India, it is agreed that, in addition to the present line of telegraph from Tehran to Bushire and submarine cable thence to India, already established in virtue of previous Treaties, a three-wire line of telegraph shall be constructed by the Persian Government from Kashau to the Baluchistan frontier, via Yezd and Kerman, traversing wherever possible inhabited districts. ARTICLE II. In order that the line of telegraph may be constructed in a complete and effective manner, the Persian Government agrees that it shall be built under the direction and supervision of the British Telegraph Staff now controlling the international line in Persia, the British Government advancing to the Persian Govern ment the salaries and allowances of the men actually employed on the work. ARTICLE III. The British Government agrees to procure for the Persian Government at a reasonable price all the posts, wire, insulators, &amp;c., that may be requisite for this work, and to. arrange for the carriage of the’ stores to the sites required, receiving payment for the same without interest as hereinafter provided. An account of the expenses incurred for this purpose, and certified, in so far as they have been incurred in Persia, by the Persian Telegraph Department, and in so far as they have been incurred outside Persia, by the British Government, shall be submitted as early as possible to the Persian Government. ARTICLE IV. The Persian Government agrees to lease the use and the transit revenue of the line, which is its property, when complete to [65J B 24 the Indo-European Telegraph Department at a rental of 4 per cent, on the capital expended on its construction, including cost material—-three quarters of such rental to be retained by th British Government to recoup them for the advances made, and one quarter, subject to a minimum of 25,000 fr., to be paid annually to the Persian Government in two half-yearly instalments. It is understood that should the Persian Government’s quarter share of the rental exceed 25,000 fr., such excess shall belong to the Persian Treasury. ARTICLE V. The maintenance of the line, including repairs and the ap pointment, control, and payment of the line guards, who must be Persian subjects, shall remain in the hands of the British Director and Staff, the cost being defrayed by the British Government. The duties of the Telegraph Inspectors and line guards are strictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. ARTICLE VI. The principal offices constituting the permanent residences of the British Electricians and Inspectors shall be situated in towns or large villages, but pending further arrangements to be agreed upon between the two Governments, there shall only be one such office between Kerman and the Indian frontier. The protection of the line and of the officials, whether Persian or British employed on it, shall be the special duty of the Persian Government, and should the English officials wish to proceed on inspections in districts proclaimed as dangerous by the Persian Government, they shall inform the nearest local authority, in order that they may be provided with an escort. The telegraph stations shall be built according to plans approved by the Persian Govern ment, and in towns the houses to be used as such stations shall, wherever possible, be rented. ARTICLE VII. The line will be of three wires. One wire will be used by the Persian Telegraph Administration for its local work, and the remaining two wires be for international traffic as provided in Articles IV, V, and VI of the 1872 Convention. ARTICLE VIII. The revenue derived from the local traffic on the Persian wire5 shall belong entirely to the Persian Government. By local traffic meant messages originating at one Persian station and termi- ing at another Persian station jffiall ^m ARTICLE IX. . ,^ s regards International messages originating or terminating m I ersia, the Persian Government shall receive two-thirds of the receipts of all bond fide terminal messages. And^ as regards transit messages, as this line is merely an alternative one to that now existing between Tehran and Bushire the arrangement already made, as detailed in Article VIII of the 1872 Convention, will remain as at present. State telegrams passing between the Government of India and the British Minister at Tehran shall be sent at half rates. ARTICLE X. In view of the erection of the new line and of the increase of telegraph stations in Eastern Persia, and in order to facilitate intercourse with them, the Indo-European Telegraph Department shall place an additional wire along the existing line between Tehran and Kashau, and the expenses of procuring, transporting, and putting up this wire will be borne by the Persian Government in the manner provided by Articles II and IV of this Convention. ARTICLE XI. The following Articles of the Telegraph Convention of 1872 shall apply to this line, viz.:—Articles VI, VIII, IX, XI, XIII, XV, and XVII. ARTICLE XII. This Convention shall remain in force until the 1st January, 1925, or for such longer period as the debt due by Persia for the construction of the line remains unpaid, and at such date it may if necessary be renewed or revised, but it shall be competent for the British Government at any time before the expiry of this Convention, on giving six months’ notice, to hand over the line in its existing condition to the Persian Government, and to withdraw its officers and employes from the country, ceasing from that date to have any further connection with this Persian Telegraph.

I. 2429. 500.—11/1911From Viceroy, 27th July 1912. Foreign Secret. Sheikh Shuaib Lighthouse. Reference to last paragraph of my telegram of 21st May. We consider terms of Persian memorandum impossible and that it is most undesirable to admit, by acting as delegate for Persia, that there is any weakness de jure in our position in regard to lighting and buoying of the Gulf. De facto our position is unassailable. We think, therefore, that Sheikh Shuaib lighthouse scheme should be abandoned and Persian Government informed accordingly. Alternative scheme of lightship on Shah Alum shoal is condemned by Admiral on technical grounds.

Barclay to Sir E. Grey. No. 28 (Secret). Tehran, ' 9th February 1912. With reference to my Despatch No. 210, of 31st October last, I have the honour to report that on the disappearance of the Mejliss I thought the moment a favourable one for approaching the Persian Government in regard to the lighthouse on the island of Sheikh Shuaib, and on the 17th ultimo 1 mentioned the scheme to the Minister for Foreign Affairs requesting the Persian Government to authorise Sheikh Ahmad Hamadi of Mugam, the Chieftain of the Island, to grant the site for the lighthouse. His Excellency promised to consult his colleagues in the Cabinet and to give me an answer shortly. On the 31st ultimo I enquired as to the decision of the Persian Government, and His Excellency replied that no definite decision had been taken, but that he thought that there would be no difficulty about the lighthouse provided it were constructed and worked by Persia. I pointed out that this was not what v T as desired. The buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf had for many years been in British hands, and it would be undesirable to make an exception in the case of the lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaib, besides which if the lighthouse were worked by the Persian Government which had no experience of such matters there could be no guarantee that it would lie efficiently done. His Excellency appeared to be under the impression that the cost of the erection of the lighthouse would be 4,COOL, and I therefore told him that we estimated the initial cost at 8,000/. and the running expenses at 400/. a year. His Excellency took note of what I said, and promised togi\e a definite answer in a few days. He added that in any case the lighthouse would hare to fly the Persian flag, and I told him that personally 1 tlionglit tliere would be no objection, to this. Yesterday I received a visit from the Chef de Cabinet of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who handed me the accompamv ing memo- landum of the tenns on which the Persian Government were prepared to consent to the construction of the lighthouse. I do not know how far His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to accept these terms. I explained to Moin el Vezareh, the Chef de Cabinet, that the question of light dues in the Persian Gulf was a large one and had not yet been considered. It would, I presume, be difficult to levy separate dues for one particular lighthouse, and should His Majesty s Government consent to the Persian Government’s bearing the cost of the construction and running of the lighthouse, some arrangement would have to be made whereby a certain proportion of the total dues eventually collected in the Gulf would be paid to the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c., The Right Hon. G. Barclay. Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;e. Memorandum. 1. The Persian Government authorises the erection, at their own cost, of a lighthouse on the coast of Sheikh Shuaib Island, for the convenience of navigation in the Gulf. 2.

Extract from British Memorandum to Turkish Government 29th July 1911. ‘‘ p ertain dl ffi ci ^ties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the bhatt-al-Arah. For a great number of years British shipping has owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over 50 years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out ^by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. dn these circumstances His Majesty’s Government have some dimcuity m appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they would^ propose to_ the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission, comprised of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. “ As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the Turkish Government, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage ; (b) to police its waters ; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements.”Any further communication on this subject should be addressed to THE SECRETARY, TRINITY HOUSE, TOWER HILL, LONDON, E.C., and the following letter and number should be quoted : B. 2322/1912 Telegraphic Address — DIOPTRIC, LONDON. *&gt; if 1 ^ ■ -v i .1 f ■’ JA i li ) 12» IM K ? r ?, 13^5 liousi, Imtiiott, (&amp;.&amp;. r am directed to acknowledge the receipt of yo ur letzer dated tie oth Instant, (Ho.P.2935), sxatinj that a telegram hag now been receiver 1 fvnm -tv-&gt; n om tne 'government of India recommending on political grounds the abandonment of the Proposal to erect a Light House on Sheikh Shuait Island in the Persian Gulf, and the substitution for u of a Lights hi p on the Stiffs Bah;, and requesting infomation as to the feasibility cf providing for Stiffs ;iank a Light Vessel constructed on somewhat less costly lines than those I recommended iv parai raph 5 of the frinitv House letter dated 25th harch 1912, for the Ligltship at t&gt; e mouth of v/ith a view to keeping expenditure, both initial ana recurring, under this head within ti e limits of the estimate for the Sheikh Shuaio Light House- ^eoJ' x am directed Go acquaint ;'ou, for the infer- ma bion ol the uarsquess of Crewe, that in the opinion of the K-lder Brethren the proposed Light Vessel off Stiffe Sank r Secretary of State, Und India Office should S, 15 AUG1S12s should Be of dimensions not smaller then those approved £2,257 for ti 3 iph t Vessel off 3hatt-al-Ar&amp;D as the former position is more exposed than the latter. fke Bloer Brethren would further suggest tnat the pro posed rig.; tsnip Be sstahlished and moored as close to dheikh snuaia Island as is possible, consistently with safety, where it would be of greater value to hsvigation ths.n it would be in the position on Stiffs Bank which is abou. 25 miles Sou th of the Island and considerably u0 the o o u v/. of th e route followed 'by tiio main traffic.

Diyatalawa, 16th iune 1912, Sir, With reference to Marine Department letter No.72/146-M of 21st May 1912, on the subject of the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf, and requesting my remarks on the substitution of a light ship on the Shah Allum Shoal for the proposed lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaib Island and the levy of dues - be pleased to lay the following observations before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council. 2.- A light vessel on Shah Allum Shoal would not be satisfactory, The shoal is rock, a bad holding ground, and the vessels could not be anchored on its shoalest part on account of the scend of the sea in a Shamal. Moreover it is out of the track usually taken by vessels navigating the Gulf. A 25-mile light would not be practicable, as it would necessitate a mast 300 feet high and a lantern weighing several tons. The usual range of light vessels is from 8 to 11 miles. Stiffe Bank would be a better position. The holding ground is more suitable and the bank more nearly in the usual track of shipping, and a light vessel placed there would be a valuable aid to ships on passage though of little use for local navigation. As the latter is of minor importance it is recommended that, rather than submit to the terms of the Persian Memorandum,_ it would be better to substitute a light vessel on Stiffe Secretary to the Government of India, Bank Marine Department.Bank for the light on Sheikh Shuaib, and thus keep the lighting of the Gulf in our own hands. 3.- It is considered that no question of the i levy of dues should he raised at present. The lighting of the Gulf should be entirely British and should be considered as one more illustration of the disinterested nature of British action in the Gulf, and as a means of strengthening our position later on should the construction of the Baghdad Railway raise questions which might tend to compromise it.

Sir:- 1 I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter P.1934 of the 28th ultimo, on the subject of the proposed erection of a lighthouse on the island of Sheikh Shuaib and of other proposed lights in the Persian Gulf. I am to state in reply that Sir E.Grey concurs in the terms of the draft telegram that the Marquess of Crewe proposes to address to the Government of India. I am, * Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, / f » t The Under Secretary of State, India Office.Fiitaan/r. Speaking from the purely local point of view,i am of opinion that as long as the lighthouse is built t manned and managed by us, our position will not be affected locally to any appreciable extent by Gi*r acting as the delegate of Persia; but please see my subsequent observa tions from international standpoint. SECOffi&amp;Y* I am of opinion that no mention need be made to the Persian Grovernment of otir intentions regarding the bjtoyage of Jaslo t Bunder Abbas, or Bushire• They have not interested themselves in our buoyage of these places in the past and if they raise any question now we should tell them that we are merely improving the buoyage facilities which we have afforded in the past and which has never bees questioned by themselves or any/body else. THIRDLY. I consider that we should make no communica tion to the Persian (Jovernment in respect of our intentions in regard to Mus&amp;ndam, Tamb, or Bahrein. FOURTHLY. as regards light on little Quoin, as it is well outside territorial waters no communication tojenybody appears to be called for or advisable. In this connection it is of course extremely unlikely that any pow r er would think of hoisting their flag there and we should not tolerate it if they did* but if that conceivable contin gency cannot be altogether dismissed it is a matter forlively ooneIdaratIon whether we had not better hoiet our flag previous to cor-Mienceinent of building operations, in any case we should certainly oommence with this item* FIFTHLY . As regards ramh t when we are ready to deposit building material we should infor?i Shaikh of Shargah and if necessary recognise his territorial rights by payment of nominal ground rent. siimx* As regards Bahrein no eomBumication to Shaikh seems necessary* He has newer been consulted in regard to existing buoys. SSVEMH* Ifo question of levy of dues should be broached to Shargah or Bahrein, at all events for the present. EIGHTH. The terms of the Persian Memorandum appear to me to be impossible of acceptance* If in spite of their attitude we decide that it is still necessary to 't proceed with this item, |hen X am of opinion that we should reply to Persian Government that if they will give us a document formally recognising our privileged position in regard to the lighting of the Gulf and entrusting to us on their behalf the management of aids to navigation j in their territorial waters in perpetuity, or for along ' '' ' : ' ' ■ J period of years; and if they will pay for the said light house and agree to drop all question of the levy of dues untilBUtil we advise them to raise it, then we s^ree to fly the Persian flag in this and all cases where they stand the cost -r.d would, to prepared to advance the cost of erection pending settlement of the question of the levy of dues. If they ffiak6 °*er this then I think we should address them a communication calculated to hang up the matter (hut leaving tne refusal ith us. and then consider whether we cannot avoid this item altogether. With re^urd to all other items of present scheme we are in a strong position for maintaining it as a wholly British enterprise so that it would be a pity to weaken our position as well as introduce a complicating element in connection with eventual levy of light dues by allowing Persia to parti cipate in regard to this one item except under the safeguards above indicated. As a possible means of avoiding this com plication I venture to suggest for consideration whether it would not be feasible and serve our purpose and that of navigation equally well if, instead of lighthouse on Shaikh Shuaib, we placed a lightship with a 20 or 25 mile light on the Shah Alima shoal. Apparently this would not only be equally useful to ships passing up and down gulf but would also serve vessels crossing from lingah to Bahrein. \then we had put up our lightship we could inform Persian Government that we had thought better to the lighthouse previously discussed.

With reference to my Despatch No. 210, of 31st October last, I have the honour to report that on the disappearance of the Mejliss I thought the moment a favourable one for approaching the Persian Government in regard to the lighthouse on the island of Sheikh Shuaib, and on the 17th ultimo 1 mentioned the scheme to the Minister for Foreign Affairs requesting the Persian Government to authorise Sheikh Ahmad Hamadi of Mugam, the Chieftain of the Island, to grant the site for the lighthouse. His Excellency promised to consult his colleagues in the Cabinet and to give me an answer shortly. On the 31st ultimo I enquired as to the decision of the Persian Government, and His Excellency replied that no definite decision had been taken, but that he thought that there would be no difficulty about the lighthouse provided it were constructed and worked by Persia. I pointed out that this was not what w r as desired. The buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf had for many years been in British hands, and it would be undesirable to make an exception in the case of the lighthouse on Sheikh Shuaib, besides which if the lighthouse were worked by the Persian Government which had no experience of such matters there could be no guarantee that it wmuld be efficiently done. His Excellency appeared to be under the impression that the cost of the erection of the lighthouse would be 4,000b, and I therefore told him that we estimated the initial cost at 8,000/. and the running expenses at 400/. a year. His Excellency took note of what I said, and promised togive a definite answer in a few days. He added that in any case the lighthouse would have to fly the Persian flag, and I told him that personally 1 thought there would be no objection to this. Yesterday I received a visit from the Chef de Cabinet of the Ministry of horeign Affairs who handed me the accompaming memo randum of the terms on which the Persian Government were prepared to consent to the construction of the lighthouse. I do not know how far His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to accept these terms. I explained to Moin el Vezareh, the Chef de Cabinet, that the question of light dues in the Persian Gulf was a large one and had not yet been considered. It would, I presume, be difficult to levy separate dues for one particular lighthouse, and should His Majesty s Government consent to the Persian Government’s bearing the cost of the construction and running of the lighthouse, some arrangement would have to be made whereby a certain proportion of the total dues eventually collected in the Gulf would be paid to the Persian Government.

The upkeep and superintendence of the lighthouse, as well as the working of the apparatus, is t emp orarily delegated by the Persian Government for convenience sake to the Anglo-Indian naval officers. 4. The cost of such maintenance will be borne by the Persian Government, who will be previously furnished with an approximate statement of the annual expense. 5.

In each year, two months after the 1st of Hamal (21st of March), a statement of accounts showing the receipts and expenses of the previous year will be handed to the Persian Government. 7. The receipts will serve to cover the expenses of administration and will, moreover, constitute a sinking fund for the capital expended in building the lighthouse. 8. The regulations concerning the working of the lighthouse, the manner in which the tolls will be collected, and the amount of such dues, will be submitted to the Persian Government, who will have the right of inspectiou. 9.

P. 642. India Office, 2nd March 1912. Sir, In continuation of the lettei from this Office, dated the 27th February I J 1 _, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state, for the confidential information of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, that as a result of correspondence with the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Treasury, it has now been decided, subject only to the assent of the last-named Department in respect of the light-vessel for the Shatt-al- Arab, to provide and maintain in the Persian Gulf the lights and buoys set out in the list enclosed. / 2. In reply to an inquiry by the Secretary of State as to the plant to be ordered from this country, the Government of India have suggested in a telegram, dated the 9th February, that Mr. D. W. Hood should be asked to advise, since no definite information is in their own possession as to the designs and requirements of the several lights and buoys beyond what is contained in Mr. Hood’s Report. The Marquess of Crewe would be greatly obliged if this suggestion could be acted on, and a statement be prepared for transmission to the Government of India showing in the case of each item of the list, whether lighthouse, light-vessel, or lighted or unlit buoy, what plant it would seem best to procure and send out from England. 3. In addition to the lights and buoys, the questions of a lighthouse tender and of a depot, have also been considered. It has been found impracticable to adapt as a tender any existing vessel, and, subject to further consideration when an accurate estimate has been framed, the Government of India have recommended the construction of a separate tender, for which, it is under stood, the Director of the Royal Indian Marine is now preparing an estimate. The estimate of Mr. Hood was, it will be remembered, 30,000k for initial, and 5,000k for annual recurring expenditure, but Lord Crewe proposes to draw attention to the desirability of effecting a reduction in these figures, and meanwhile he would be glad to learn, for the assistance of the Govern ment of India in preparing their estimate, on what data Mr. Hood’s estimate was prepared, and whether, in view of the more moderate scheme that has now been decided on, the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a smaller and less expensive tender might be sufficient. 4. With regard to the lighthouse depot, I am to enquire whether the sum of 22,000k allowed for in Mr. Flood’s estimate cannot also now be substantially reduced. Both the Secretary of State and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are desirous of confining the scheme to the barest requirements of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and they hope that some The Secretary to the Elder Brethren, Trinity House, E.C, S. 141.—2.2 economy may be practicable as regards the depot. It would be convenient if a list of the plant to be stored in the depot, with estimates, could also be supplied. 5. As regards the location of the depot, it has recently been suggested by the Government of India that this should be on land acquired by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company at Abadan Island, instead of at Koweit, as proposed by the Committee. A further communication will be made to you upon this subject, but it would be convenient if meanwhile particulars could be prepared, to be discussed if necessary at an informal conference, of the extent of land that would be required for the purpose, and the works to be installed. 6 . The favour is requested of an early reply, since it is proposed now to proceed with the lighting and buoyage scheme with the least possible delay. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. Ritchie. (mSECRET. [Thi8 d ocument is the pr operty of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] SELECTION OF CORRESPONDENCE AS TO THE LIGHTING AND BUOYAGE OF THE PERSIAN GULF I. Copy ° f a letter from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to 1 the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Denartment No. 38-1462-XO., dated Bombay, the 25th February 1911^ P ’ ^ ^ V / th re ^ eren 1 ce ^ the telegrams from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf from Fao dated 21st, 22nd, and 23rd instant, relative to the proceedings of the Turkish Gunboat “ Marmariss ” in connection with the buoyage of the rivei Shatt-al-Arab, be pleased to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council that it appears necessary to take steps as soon as possible towards putting the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf upon a satisfactory footing. 2 . The recent development of events in the Shatt-al-Arab points to the imminence of the danger that Germany will press the local authorities to establish the necessary safeguards for navigation independently of us, and that she will thus by degrees undermine the position of Great Britain as paramount Power in the Gulf. It is obvious that if Germany had wished to act in a friendly manner, her complaints about the buoys and the difficulties of the bar would have been addressed to the British instead of to the Turkish Government, as it is common knowledge in the Gulf that the Shatt-al-Arab is surveyed and the buoys maintained by British and not Turkish authorities. 3. That which has occurred in this instance may well be done in other cases, and the only way to prevent a repetition is to forestall the Germans by taking action ourselves. We cannot expect to maintain an exclusive position in the Gulf unless prepared to pay something towards it, and the most pressing needs at present appear to be the provision of some system, of lights and buoys as safeguards to navigation, and the installation of wireless telegraphy to facilitate communications. With regard to the latter I have already placed my views before His Excellency in Council in my letter No. 24/1470 of 4th February 1911. 4. The lighting and buoys question was investigated by a Committee consisting of the Political Resident in the Persian Gtilf, the Captain of H.M.S “ Sphinx,” the Officer in charge of the Marine Survey of India, and a representative of Trinity House, who reported on 29th April 1909. The lights proposed by the Committee in order of importance are :— Shatt-al-’Arab bar, L. V. and 4 buoys. Musandam (Little Quoin). Masqat. Bushire. Sheikh Shuaib. Ras-as-Mutaf. Tamb. Kubbar Island (Kuwait). Ras-al-Arz (Kuwait). Bahrain. Lingeh. Dibai. Bandar Abbas. 1 consider that this order should be slightly varied for political reasons, and that it is now necessary first of all to provide a line of lights that will facilitate the passage of ships up and down the Gulf. * Communicated to Foreign Office and Admiralty, 23rd March 1911. S. 99.la 5. If the lights be proviaed at Musandam (Little Quoin), l amb and Sheikh Shuaib, and the light vessel be placed at Bushire, all that is immediately necessary on that account will then have been done. 6 I further suggest that the light vessel at the bar of the Shatt-al- Arab be established. It may appear that the provision of the acetylene gas buoy would be sufficient for all purposes, but if the navigation of the entrance to the Shatt-al-’Arab is to be placed upon a thoroughly satisfactory footing, a light vessel moored about 4 miles to seaward of the outer bar buoy will be an absolute necessity. Without a vessel of this kind it is always difficult to uick up the buoy 'in thick weather, and it is desirable to have someone alwavs on the spot, as would be the case if a light vessel were provided m order to prevent the Arab fishermen from interfering with the buoy. The fishermen do considerable damage to the existing buoys and carry oil anything portable. 7 I would strongly recommend that the proposals of the Committee relative to the lighthouse tender and the buoys in the Gulf, particularly with regard to those at Bahrain, be carried out at an early date. Ihe provision of the other lights recommended by the ( ommittee might be proceeded with as convenient, but should not be unduly delayed. 8 The question as to dues to be paid for the lights when established is difficult to solve, and is a matter upon which I can offer very few sug- o-estions It would appear that the only possible way in which to levy dues so that they may fall equally upon all ships, both British and foreign is to collect them through the local authorities. This might be done by the Persian customs at Bushire, or, in the case of ships which do not call there, at any Persian Port at which they may touch, or at Masqat. It might be possible to levy a small due at Bahrain and Kuwait, through the bheikhs, lor the local buoyage and lights. Under any circumstances, since we cannot ]gyy tPo dues in our own ports, it must be a matter ol agreement with all the Powers concerned, and if we establish an efficient lighting seivice, it is improbable that any great difficulties will be made with regard to the collection of these dues. 9 . I consider the improvement and safeguarding of the navigation in the Gulf to be so important that the establishment of these lights should be undertaken as soon as possible, without waiting for the settlement of the question of light dues. Something may be risked, but it is so necessary to establish our control over the Gulf beyond the possibility of interference by other Powers that I respectfully submit that it is worth the risk. II. Telegram P. From the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. No. 218. Dated and received 17th March 191 IN Your endorsement No. 486 E/A, dated 2nd March. I endorse the view expressed m final sentence of fourth paragraph of Commander-in-Chief s letter, and agree that the four items mentioned in the fifth paragraph will form best skeleton scheme to start with, with reference to the point of view of navigation as well as present political developments. Should it not be possible to commence the three lighthouses simultaneously, recent opinions expressed to me by navigators incline me to think that they would prefer to get Tamb and Sheikh Shuaib before Musandam, the last-named being the easiest to pick up in the dark. I concur generally in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Admiral’s letter, and especially agree as to necessity for the scheme being proceeded with, without waiting for settlement of problem as to dues to be levied, since this is a question which is only capable of adjustment after full discussion as the scheme develops. * * Communicated to Foreign Office and Admiralty, lOtli April 1911.3 III. Paraphrases, of Telegraphic Correspondence. From Viceroy, 27th April 1911. P* Persian Gulf buoy ing and lighting. Please see my telegram dated the Mh instant, _ Reference is invited to telegram dated 17th ultimo from Resident, Persian Gulf, forwarded with weekly letter, dated 23rd ultimo from Secretary to Government of India, Foreign Department. Recommendations of Resident and A aval Oommander-in-Ohief have my general support, particu larly m view of activity m improving buoyage and lighting of Shat-el-Arab which is at present being displayed by Turks. But construction, taneously with others, of lighthouse at Musandim seems to me preferable. I consider it better, with reference to proposal of Admiral that light vessel should be placed at bar of Shat-el-Arab, to wait first and see whether Turks place their light ship properly, and whether it is ''maintained in perfect order by them, ^ 1 would invite attention to remark of Committee that, as regards Sheikh Shuaib, it would be necessary to approach Persian Government. Instructions are solicited, before detailed estimates are prepared, as to actual measures which His Majesty’s Government consider necessary. ^Expenditure involved should, it is also recommended, be borne by Indian and Imperial Exchequei s m equal shares. IT e will submit later a further report as to possibility of obtaining a Royal Indian Mar me vessel suitable for conversion into lighthouse tender. See report by Mr. Hood. Enquiry is being made on this point. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 10th May 1911. 'P.— Please refer to your telegram dated the 27th April 1911. I recognise in all the circumstances that time has arrived when-it is no longer possible to defer scheme having for its object lighting of Persian Gulf. Recommendations in your telegram are generally approved, with concurrence of Foreign Office, and your are requested to furnish as soon as possible detailed estimates in accordance therewith. Also consulting Admiralty. After your estimates have been considered the Treasury will be approached. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 10th June 1911. P. —Please refer to my telegram datad 10th May 1911. In a letter dated 20th ultimo to Foreign Office, copy of which was enclosed in Secretary's letter dated 2nd instant, Admiralty concur in proposal that Musandim lighthouse should be constructed simultaneously with two other lighthouses; but they are of opinion that purposes of a British light vessel four miles seaward of outer bar buoy, SImt-el-Arab, would not in any way be answered by Turkish light vessel close to that buoy. Reference is also invited to Admiral Slade's letter to Admiralty of 11th ultimo, paragraph 5. I shall be glad to have your view as to acetylene gas buoy at inner bar, also recommended by the Admiral in his letter, and to learn whether you have any f urther observations as to British light vessel. You might include provisionally in your estimates the cost of both. From Viceroy, 27th June 1911. P.— Persian Gulf buoying a,nd lighting. See your telegram dated the 10th instant. I agree after further inquiry both as to provision of acetylene gas- buoy at inner bar, and as to desirability of British light vessel being placed, as recommended by Admiral, four or five miles to seaward of gas outer buoy. Further inquiry is being made, there being some difficulty as to preparation of detailed estimates, and a further report will be sent. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, llfh August 1911. P. —See your telegram dated 27th June last. Please let me have as soon as possible estimates as to gas buoy and light vessel in Persian Gulf. Admiralty express themselves in favour of both; see their letter of 4th instant forwardedwith letter of 11th instant from Secretary, Political Department, India Office. With a view to avoidance of international difficulties, Admiralty consider that inner bar buoy, laying of which was reported to you by Admiral Slade in his letter of 19th May, and not the Turkish buoy opposite, should be replaced by gas buoy. Presumably this was the intention of Your Excellency. From Viceroy, 21st August 1911. P. — Persian Gulf buoying and lighting. See your telegrain dated the 11th instant. It is impossible, I regret to say, to furnish detailed estimates, or preliminary estimates of greater accuracy than those of Mr. Hooder, who studied the matter locally, for light vessel, gas buoy, or any other items of the scheme. There is no vessel at our disposal available for conversion into tender for lighthouse. Please refer to our telegram dated the 27th April 1911. Arrange ments might possibly be made, though this cannot be relied on, for S.S. “ Patrick Stewart,' belonging to Indo-European Telegraph Department, in one combined monthly tour, to act as tender besides performing her usual work. A single tour of the light-houses would, it is estimated, occupy 15 days, and daily cost of hiring the ££ Patrick Stewart ” woidd be Rs. 626 As. 8 . As regards gas buoy, reply to your query is an affirmative one.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100045791442.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/444/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100045791442.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/444/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 50/1914 Pt 12 'Persian Gulf: lighting and buoying; proposed lighthouse on Shaikh Shuaib Island; attitude of Persian Govt'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1913</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-30T16:27:55</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (100 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This item contains papers relating to the British effort to install a permanent maritime navigation infrastructure in the Persian Gulf.
