W. 1. 18th October, 1941 Dear Sir, ‘ I wonder if the Secretary of State would be kind enough to help me in a matter v/hich, I fear, sounds rather like something out of a William Le Queux novel. An invalid aunt of mine, who died in 1936, had for many years a nurse-companion, Miss Nancy oykes, of York. During their travels abroad, they met one Ali Bayendor, a Persian, and eventually Miss Sykes married him and went to live at Abadan. When my aunt died, she left me as trustee for her estate and I have to pay £200 a year to Mrs. Bayendor for life. Ali Bayendor was one of the Shah’s ’’gang”, I believe, and was put in charge of the Iranian Navy. Although I always understood him to be strongly pro-British, I now hear that he was killed fighting against us during the late troubles. I am very anxious to hear what has become of his widow, and if she is in any need. Bayendor was presumably, well-off, but she has no resources other than the annual sum v/hich I pay her under my aunt’s Would it be possible for our authorities out there to get in touch with her, and give her any help or advice which she may need? Che was, of course, a British subject before her marriage. will Yours faithfully, (signed) Robert T. Bower The Private secretary, The Foreign Office 8.
