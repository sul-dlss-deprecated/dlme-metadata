Sometime ago Mr.C.F.Macpheraon mentioned the matter to me informally saying that the Company had asked him to make enquiries etcaetera,and I told him that I thought it would be better for the Company to mention the matter to Government or to you in order that the Shaikh of Katar and other local authorities might be given intimation before hand: otherwise they might prove obstructive.- I had thought of sounding Shaikh Abdulla and the Amir of Katif in the course of friendly visits which I had hoped to pay them about this time,but for various reasons both trips have fallen through. In the circumstances I think it would be better if iMTTuni you •mmrnrn Jyou writa letters to Shaikh Abdulla bin Jaaim and Bin Saud, and I oould sand them (or at all events the first A addressee) on with a covering letter. I think the proposal is worthy of our support and should be encouraged* There has been some more or less vague talk of a launch service being started,and Ali bin Ibrahim Zayani,Agent of the Persian Gulf steamship Com pany is said to have ordered a small steamer (vide diary No.91) . I do not think there would be much local opposition to the scheme except from the owners of boats which ply between Bahrein and the neighbouring ports.

Bahrain-Qatif-Jubail and back to Bahrain, in the first half of each week (leaving Monday and returning Thursday). (2). Bahrain-0jair and back, in the latter part of each week (leaving Friday and returning Saturday). f The ferry steamer being small would be cheap to run, and could get inside Ojair and Q .atif harbours without difficulty at high tide. Should the British India not agree to this, I would suggest that Big steamers (slow Gulf) be made to call at one of the V ^ following ports}I give them in order of importance.- &lt; (1).Ojair. 1 (2).Jubail.

I have not,so far, heard the results of recent references by H.M.G. to the British India Steam Navigation Company,but the following steps seem to me to be necessary. Firstly to inform the B.I.S.N.Coy that Bin Sa'ud has for some years been pressing, and is now pressing with insistence,for the regular visit of a merchant steamer to one or all of the als®*® Ports of Hasat-Ojair,Katif and Jubail, and that H.M.G. would be . glad to see his wishes gratified. That a regular service to the above I || norts by a small subsidiary steamer based on Basrah would seem to i meet the case best,and that the Government would be glad if the Company would forthwith examine the question, and say would, can best be managed by them. It is proposed as a result of my discussam . v with Bin Sa'ud that while awaiting the result of negotiations on - ■ » 1 ' . these lines, that merchants engaged in the impot trade to Nejd have their merchandise attached to the manifest and sac inar/.ea for i-aoc Ports' by arrangement with the B.I.

Your most obedient humble servant, (Signed) BEYOISIIEI81- India Office, Whitehall, I London, S.W.I. 1 ' 20th December, 1923, ,/ In reply to your letter of the 14th September, No,43397, 1 am directed by the Secretary rrs dated 0f 3tate ror Iridia to be laid before'the l»2o be ere tary oi btate for the Colonies, the accompanying I G0 py oi a telegram from the Government of India on j the subject of the extension of Nejdi influence in Bahrein and Koweit. In regard to the position at Koweit where it seems die Sultan of Hejd has contemplated the extension of his influence through the agency of Sheikh Abdullah-as-Salim, under cover of an arrange ment in respect of customs duties on goods passing through Koweit to and from Mejd, the Secretary of State shares the Government of India's diffidence in offering any comment. But prima facie it would appear, as the Government of India suggest, that the arrangement in question would, in any case, be in contravention of the spirit of the undertakings given by His Majesty's Government in Article IX of the Agreement of 15th Oct, 1907 with Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit (and repeated in the message of 5th July 1918 to Sheikh Salim) and by Ibn Saud in Article VI of the Treaty of 26th December 1915;, and in contraven tion of the letter also of these Agreements, if the arrangement were imposed on the Sheikh and people of Koweit without their full consent. Moreover, however UNDER SEGRETAHY OF STATE, COLONIAL OFFICE,5th Oct however willingly the arrangement might be accepted by K oweit in the first instance, it would seem to have inherent dangers of friction between Kowe it and Me jd in the future. In bo far as Ibn Sand's apparent attempt to extend his influence over Koweit is actuated by a desire to regularis© the imposition of dues on Nejdi imports and exports overseas, it would seem desirable, if it is practicable, to seek a solution of the Koweit Nejdi dispute, by finding for Nejd some other outlet to the sea than Koweit,. and developing it. In 1920 (vide enclosed copy of a telegram from Sir P.Cox) Ibn Saud was anxious to develop one of his Hasa ports. The matter was referred by Lord In cheaps (who was consulted semi-officially) to the Managing Agents in India of the British India Steam Navigation Company for direct discussion with Sir P. Cox: and the Secretary of State is not aware of what may have resulted. If possible, however, the develop merit of a port of hiis own by the Sultan of Nejd would seem, most desirable not only as tending to eliminate causes of friction with and aggression on Koweit and B ahrein, but also as the Government of India indicate, as causing him to establish a valuable interest exposed directly to His Majesty's ixovernment power. In regard to .Bahrein, the Secretary of State agrees with the view expressed by the Government of India; the elimination of Nejdi influence in those islands would no doubt be expedited, no less than in Koweit, by the development, should it prove possible, | of a port in Nejdi territory. I have etc., (Sd) L.D.Wakely, iiw? I TELEGRAM FROM VICEROY, TO SECRETARY OF [I STATE FOR INDIA, DATED 13.12.23. P. 1727, Please refer to your telegm-is dated 19th | September and 14th November , Nos,3392 and, 4050. I As you are aware, we are, on principle averse from | commitments in regard to the hinterland of Arabia j hut, treaty obligations, wliicb. we must of course j observe, complicate the position in regard to Koweit, l On the one hand, definite promise lias been given by I Ibn Saud, himself, that he will refrain from all inter ference with or aggression upon Koweit territories ;and on the other hand, possession of the 'town of Koweit ! and its boundaries' (whatever the exact meani ng of that phrase may be) has been guaranteed by us to Ibn Subah | family and, in our treaty with Ibn Saud, we have I /da apparently mentioned Sheikh of Koweit as one of the ^ protected Sheikhs. No allusion, earlier than April, ] 1922, to Ibn Saud * s suggestion that collection of his customs dues should be made in town of Koweit, instead of on his own frontier, can be traced in our records. In addition, we have no detailed information, since that date, regarding the course of His Majesty's Government's negotiations with Ibn Saud on this point. Our remark a are, therefore, given with diffidence, but, prima facie, both our own and Ibn Saud 1 s engagements would appear to be violated by Ibn Saud * s suggestion, and latter, for this reason, should be opposed. If this is done, automatic decrease in Ibn Baud's influence in Koweit, will take place. Apart from our obligations to protected Sheikhs, including Koweit, we should welcome Ibn Sand's extension to sea, pre ferably in port which he has himself developed. He would thus be rendered more accessible to our naval powerAf$% So power but possible effect of policy which Hia Majesty's Government now contemplates regarding our relations with Ion oaud, is a question which xg beyond, our purview. As regards Bahrein, we should welcome extinction of Ibn Baud % s influence in that island*III i • ■ . ..forthwith, and say what they can best manage. Pending outcome of negotiations on above lines, it is proposed, as result of my discuasion with Bin Saud, that merchants engaged in import trade to Nejd should arrange with B, 1,33.C,, Bombay and Karachi, to have their (?consignments) manifested and marked for 'Hassa Ports', and to transfer them in Bahrein Harbour to dhows especially engaged to ply oetween Bahrein and Ojair etc. Political Agent, Bahrein will take this (?up) with British Indian Landing Contractor at Bahrein, and if necessary, with the Sheikh who might be allowed to levy small (?trans-shipment) fees, but no longer full duty. Pending intimation of result of Govern ment reference to British India Steam Navigation Company, no action will be taken from here as re gards establishment of subsidiary steamer.IV 1 ' i f f i f.:' # 1- ?// ■ ft /&lt; • Endoesement from the Under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Btjshire, No. 113-S., dated Bushire, the 10th (received 16th) Pebrtjary 1924.

Letter from the Hon'ble the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 10—110-S., dated Bushire, the 10th February 1924 (Confidential). I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch, dated 16th of January 1924, regarding the policy of His Highness the Sultan of Nejd in extending his influence in Kuwait and Bahrain, and the possible development of an alternative port for Bin Sand's territory. 2. I agree with the view that, if a port on the Hassa Coast were developed, Bin Saud would have no reasonable ground for trying to extend his influence to Kuwait and Bahrain—with both of which places he has by treaty agreed to refrain from interfering. But whether he would, in point of fact, actually refrain from intrigues is open to doubt, and even if he did, whether his agent and local representatives would follow his example is, in my opinion, open to greater doubt. 3. But I think we should be in a better position to resist his _ intrigues (if any) and to hold him to his treaty obligations if we helped him in the matter of a port. His Highness has always desired a port from the day he turned the Turks out of Hassa and Qatif in 1912. At that time I was Political Agent in Bahrain and remember a wretched old tramp coasting steamer named the ' John 0. Scott '—which at that time was one of the lightering vessels at Basrah and used occasionally to visit Qatif and Ojair was in Ojair and Bin Saud sent the surrendered Turkish troops over to Bahrain. That gave him the idea that Ojair was a port and he has always harped on it. Actually it is a miserable place and no vessels drawing more than about 16 feet can/go there with safety, and even shallow draft vessels cannot go with real safety as the channel is not properly charted. It was only because the 'John O. Scott' was practically valueless that the owners allowed her to visit the place. She subsequently formed one of the trio of ships sunk by the Turks above the Shaikh of Mohammerah's Palace to block the fairway to Basrah. 4. After Bin Saud had mentioned his idea of a port at an interview I had with him at Ojair in 1912, I took the matter up with the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company at Bahrain and a proposal was made to utilize a small paddle steamer owned by the Company to run a monthly trip to Qatif, Ojair and Doha (Katar) from Bahrain as a base. This idea nearly materialized but got hung up by the war, and I fancy the small paddle steamer was utilized for some other purpose. Later there was an idea of using a small steamer from Basrah, and finally in January 1922 the local agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company consulted me about an occasional call at Ras Tanura by the subsidiary mail. They were not at all keen on this however, as it would delay the subsidiary steamer and was rather a step in the dark as no British India stGameis had ever been there. So, after consulting with Sir Percy Cox, I informed the Agents that owing to the (then) recent arrangement I had made with the Shaikh of Bahrain by which goods booked through to Hassa and Nejd only paid 2 per cent, customs duty at Bahrain, the matter had lost some of its urgency from our point of view, and might be held up pending a fresh move on the part of Bm Saud. I also informed the local Agents that the Commander of B. 1. M. Survey2 Vessel ' Palinurus ' , who, at my suggestion, had been sent by the Government of India to survey the neighbourhood of Qatif, informed me that Has Tanura was an awful place to get to and would require a number of buoys and lights to make the approaches at all safe, besides being absolutely open to the ' Kaus' (South Easter) : since then the question of opening a port on the Hassa Coast has been allowed to rest, 5. I may mention that the result of the investigations of the tc Palinurus' was to prove to the Commander that Qatif was the only possible place at which decent sized steamers could call; it is comparatively easy of access, but has the objection that a steamer of even 20 feet draught has to lie about five miles off the town. I presume from the remarks in paragraph three of your letter that this view has already been submitted to His Majesty's Government, but it is perhaps worth while to mention it again. I will consult the British India Ageats again and, if they consider a visit by the slow mail to Qatif in any way feasible, I will communicate with Bin Saud in the sense of paragraph 4 of your despatch. Copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India. GCP, DaJbi —XI—799—14-3-24—7.0tam1a persia corporation ltd. *tele6raphic address: m espe rs .
