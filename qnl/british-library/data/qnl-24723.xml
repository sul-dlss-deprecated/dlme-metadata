Cn the ICth December 1934 the belongings ol t''/o psthans -vno vere travelling in s train from i'arachi to Peshavsr vere searched and iron the bedding of one of them tas recovered a .303 bore service rifle, complete except for the butt. Particulars of the .veapon are as follows: * .303 bore, Infield, bearing Nos. 1113 and 1304 on body and magazine respectively, Doit No. 33353. As a result of investigation it transpires that these t vo Pathans are drill instructors of tiie Bahrein Police and are at present on 3 months * leave. The man from vhose possession the rifle vas actually recovered gives his name ^s Ns vab Khan, s/o Adam Dul, caste Fsrnberkhel Afridi of village Bhutan in T irah, ^ribal 'erritory. His story is that in October 1931, he enlisted as a Cepoy in Pesha .vsr and vas sent to tne l/124th Baluch Regiment at Quetta. He served in the Regiment at Msrgha ( /aziristan), Lore Lai and Aurangabad until 19 38 vhen he resigned and returned home. His house vas destroyed by fire a short vhile later and he vas, therefore, obliged to seek further employment . Hearing that Pstn an s vere being enlisted in the Karscu1 Police, ne proceeded to Karachi in Novemoer 1932 and applied for enlistment. He vas refused butoot-sineci sn appointment in the Bahrein Police at He.25/- p.tn. atii rations ana clothing and sailed xrorn Karachi lor Bahrein on the 27th Novemoer 1932. He vss appointed drill instructor in the Bahrein Fort and had put in tvo years* service vhen he applied for 3 months leave vhich 'as granted. Prior to his departure on leave, he purchased for a sum of 3 s.80/- from one ill Mirza, s 3hia Muslim of Iran, vho vas also a Hsvildsr drill instructor in the Bahrein Police, the rifle recovered from his possession. He had little difficulty in smuggling the veapon t hrough the Customs at Karachi. He travelled oy the 3.3, Bandrs with l.'ehr Did Khan and Sepoys Vail Khan and Khair Jan of the 10th Baluch .Regiment Depot, Karachi. The other Pa than gives his name as Maher Oil Khan, s/o Monammad Rsiiq, caste Beni Khattak of vixlsge end P.3, Lschi, District Kohat, N.7.F. Province. His story is that he ms enlisted at Kohst on the 1st April 10 13 and ws sent to the 2/124th Baluch Regiment at pishin. He served pith the Regiment at Pishin, Multan, /sziristsn, Egypt and Hyderabad, Sind. The regiment vas disbanded at Hyderabad and he vas then transferred to trie 130tn Baluch Regiment from vhich he vas discharged and appointed as a reservist. He then obtained employment in the Supply Department at Kohat and served there for about 3* years vhen he vss obliged to resign owing to illness, i-ater, he proceeded to Karachi and interviewed the Cifleer Commanding, one Reserve Battalion of the Bsluch Regiment, Karachi, and through him secured a post in the Bahrein Police as s sepoy end sailedfe. - eaxmm^ © ffjL for Bahrein on the 18th BecemDer 1932. He denied sll knowledge of the rifle recovered f rom Ns vs'o Khan' s hedding. Investigation also revealed that these persons had drought vith tnem from Bahrein two large parcels said to have been given to them oy one 3-hulern Mohi-ud-Bin, a Psthsn of feshawar district, a dismissed Police Inspector of the Basrah Police .vho no v owns a garden named Alystim Bistsn at a distance of d/6 miles from Bahrein, for delivery to some one residing in the Peshawar district. Tnese parcels they said, contained dates and had been despatched oy post from Karachi. /e suspected that these parcels might contain arms, so had them detained and examined, out the contents proved to be dates as stated by them. i/e shall be grateful if enquiries could be made from Bahrein as to the ownership of the rifle recovered and what truth there is in the story given by these two Pathsns. Nswab Khan would seem to nave obtained his appointment to the Bahrein Police on the understanding that he vas a British subject, whereas in reality he comes from 'ribal Territory.7 ) Confidential • r, ■*’ r , n / z r zr\ ^ • •./ r tv./ « \y/ O- • 18th May 193b. &lt;-N Prohibition regarding the import of arms and ammunition into Bahrain.

Bahrain, May 1305. Dear Cole, fl - reference your C/336 of 3C-5-C5, reterring to your e/*2 of 5-3-35. One of the men concerned Mir Dil, has recently returned from leave, the other man, Nawab Khan, has not come back and. has been struck off the strength of the Police. No rifles are missing from the port. It would be easy for anyone to buy a rifle in Bahrain as there are numbers of rifles in the possession of the public including dud service rities which are saiu to be brought in from Qattar. Until there is some legislation regarding firearms it is impossible to trace the owners of rifles. Havildar uli Mirza aenies all knowledge of the rifle. hX the time that Nawab nhan went on leave Havildar Ali Mirza was on leave. Incidentally the Havildar and Nawab Khan were on bad terms with each other. I think Nwab Kha^s statement that he bought the rifle from ^ii Mirza is a lie. Ghulam Mohi-ud-^Kh who is mentioned is known to me and I have heard of his antecedents irom Colonel rrescott, Commissioner of Police, 'Ira^. He is working as a market gardener in partnership with Hussein Yatim at Barbar and is iriendiy with Indians who are attached to the otate Police as instructors, he and they expected that he would have-2- 0) /O have been appointed as police Inspector in Bahrain on the death ot' the late Haji ouiman last year. Both Nawab Khan and uii Jihan were obtained from the Reserve Battalion of the Baluch Regiment, Karachi and I was under the impression that they were either runjabis or Baluchis. Apart irom this incident their work has been satisiactory. Here in Bahrain, the question of their caste or nationality does not appear important. I assumed that they were recommended by the Officer Commanding, Reserve Battalion, Baluch Regiment, Karachi, that they were suitable men for employment. Yours sincerely, Captain G. a.

The Adviser to the Bahrain Government reports that no service rifle is missing from the Police *ort. Firearms of all kinds including .303 rifles can be obtained locally and it is quite possible that Nawab Khan smuggled one of these out of Bahrain. The probable source from which Nawab Kuan obtained the rifle is known and is be ng watched by the local Police. Nawab Khan’s statement that he purchased the rifle from HavIldar All Mirza Is not correct, as the lavildar was on leave in India when Nawab Khan went on leave. In addition these two men were on bad terms. 3. Both Nawab Knan and Mir Dll Kuan were recruited as Instructors for the Baurain Police tnrougu the Officer Commanding, the 10th Baluch Hegiment at Karachi.

Sir, I have tne honour to draw your attention to the increasing numbers of persons of all kinds who are in possession of firearms, in Bahrain, and to request that necessary steps may be taken to ensure that only approved persons may possess firearms. ? # Despite the Notifications dated the 30th April 1893 issued by the Shaikh of Bahrain concerning the import and export of arms, there exists no means to prevent the manu facture or possession of ^'irearms in —ahrsin* At pretent it appears that firearms are being smuggled from the Hasa Coast by night into Bahrain at or about Has al Barr and these find, their vray to whomsoever can afford to by tnem* Their possession of these firearms is not illegal since there exists in Bahrain no legislation by reason of which such possession coula be considered illegal. Further the Notifications tec tne ?0th April 1398 provide no penalty for their contravention ;x: # j t iereforc recommend that under the Bahrain Or^er—in Council f, The Indian Arms Act” be added to the schedule of Acts applicable to Bahrain. Should my recommendation be accepted /legislationlegislation iimilar to The Indian Arms Act will be introduced by the Bahrain government at the same time.

I think that instead of applying the Indian Arms Act (XI of 1878) and the Bahrain Government making similar elaborate Regulations, it would seem preferable for the Bahrain Government to frame and publish a simple set of Rules and for it to be applied to foreigners by King's Regulation under Section 70 (b) of the Order in Council. 3. The Bahrain Government Rules might cover the following points, and any other which you and the Bahrain Government consider necessary. (i) Importation or exportation forbidden except under license. (ii) Manufacture of firearms or ammunition absolutely forbidden. (iii) present possessors of firearms shoula within specified period and take ouu licenses. (small or nQ&gt; fee). (iv) Renewal of licenses (say) every two years. (Small or no fee). (v) Holders to produce arms on demand oi police toi inspection. (vi) Transfers to be registered.(Small or no lee). (vii) /(vii) Penalty for breach of any of above Rules, say, for confiscation and imprisonment up to one y^sr fine up to Rs.2,000/- (on analogy of Section 2/ of Bahrain Order in Council). 4. The Registration, licensing etc. could be done by the Bahrain Government for foreigners as well as their own subjects. 6. Please discuss the matter with Mr. Belgrave on the above lines. Mr. Belgrave should then draw up and forward to you a draft of the proposed Bahrain Government Rules, which you should send on to me with a draft of the proposed Kind’s Regulation. I will then approach Government for the King's Regulation to be allowed. The Bahrain Government Rules should not of course be published or brought into force until the King's Regulation can be applied in order that the Rules may be applied simultaneously both to foreigners (over whom control is chiefly required) and Bahrainis. sd.

C/381-18/3 dated 2nd July 1935 on the subject of arms and ammunition. 1 enclose the draft of a proclamation to be issued by the Government of Bahrain on the lines in your letter. 2. With reference to clause 3 of my draft, 1 have not suggested that a license can be obtained permitting the import or export of firearms and ammunition. In the past it has been the custom invariably to refuse such applications whether made by Arabs or Europeans. 1 think it is better that this policy should continue and to mention the possibility of permission being obtainable, as suggested in your letter, would produce innumerable applications. I do not think that firearms are required in Bahrain by Europeans and Americans as a measure of protection and the very small amount of game which exists is carefully preserved by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. 3 . Your letter suggests the renewal of licenses. I do not think there is any- 2 - any real need for this. It is presumed that the number of firearms will not increase, as the import is forbidden, therefore the necessity for annual or bi annual renewals does not exist. 4. The wearing of daggers and ♦ carrying of swords, except by authorised persons, has been forbidden here, since the time of Shaikh Isa, though I am unable to find a copy of an Alaan forbidding it. The import of 'Arms' is also forbidden. 5. The question of issuing a pro clamation on these lines has been considered by Shaikh Hamad for some months, since the attack on the villages of Zinj and Barbar, and both he and Shaikhs Abdullah and Sulman are strongly in favour of it. Yours sincerely, Captain G. A. Cole. I.A., H.S.M's Political Agent, Bahrain.Proclamation. 11 Arms ordinance — 1354 .

Thou$a ths notifica tion is enforced at the Customs House, it is easy for bedouin and others to bring arms with them if they l^nd at places along the Coast and there is, thersfore, little difficulty in the way of anyone obtaining firearms of sorts. 3 . There have recently been two or three armed robberiee amounting almost to attacks on vlllagss and various crimes aggravated by casualties inflicted by lethal weapons. These crimes are usually carried out by wild foreigners, such as hajdis, liasawia and so on. Simla.

It is observed that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft King’s Regulation contain an absolute prohibition. The license provisions which follow relate only to persons already in possession of fireams (and apply only to firearms, not to ammunition). There is in fact no provision for a license for importing or possessing firearms or ammunition not already in the country. It may be that this is what is intended, but before proceeding further the Secretary of State would be glad to be assured that the omission is deliberate. 3.

Originally it was the intention of the Bahrain Govern ment, with Yhich I concurred, that the prohihition against the importation of arms and ammunition should be absolute, it being understood that the requirements of the Bahrain orovernment and of H^s Majesty^ Government would not be regarded as subject to the reflations. o # On further consideration, however, as the result of our discussions, it seems desirable to provide in the proposed order of the Bahrain Government and King ! s Begulation ior the importation of arms and-ammunition for the purposes of the Bahrain Government and of His Majesty’s Government, and also to give the Political Agent discretion to permit their inmort in exceptional circumstances. It also se( ms desirable to provide for revoking licenses. 4 . It is, therefore, proposed that the following /amendmentst r 2 . amendments should be made In the draft Order and king's Kegulation:- Ci). In the Order of the Bahrein ^overmcent:- (a) add at the end of paragraph 6 a sentence 'Licenses may be revoked by the Bahrain Government.' (b) add a paragraph 13 - 'These orders do not apply to arms and amirainition imoorted^ for the purposes of the Bahrain Government.' (ii). In the King’s Begulation*- (a) add to paragraph 3 after the word 'ammunition' the words 'hut in exceptional circumstances the Political Agent may(allow)the importation of arms and ammunition.' (b) add at the end of paragraph 6 a sentence 'Licenses may be revoked by the Political A.gent.' (c) add a paragraph 13 - 'These orders do not apply to arms and ammunition imported for the purposes of His Majesty’s Government.' (d) the existing paragraph 13 should be renumbered as paragraph 14.

U63/^6 respectively, regarding the proposal to issue a King’s Regulation under the Bahrain Order-in-Counci1, 1913, to regulate the possession and traffic in arms. 2. The Marquess of Zetland agrees with the Political Resident and the Government of India as to the desirability of such a Regulation, and considers that tae enclosed draft (which is on the lines finally recommended by the Government of India but with the addition of the word ’’firearms” in Articles 3 and 13 and of a modified form of the original Article 12) is suitable. The reason for retaining Article 12 in a modified form is that while penalties are prescribed by Articles 71 and 27 of the Order- in Council, provision for forfeiture must, under Article 71 of the Order-in-Council, be made in a Regulation. 3. If Mr.Secretary Eden concurs in the terms of the Regulation, I am to request that he will be good enough to take steps formally to allow it and cause this Office to be informed with a view to the necessary intimation being made to the Political Resident and the Government of India. 4. In accordance with Lord Monteagle’s letter of 29th May 1930, No.2722/2722/91, it is presumed that the The Under-Secretary of State, Regulation/ Foreign Office, s ‘ ¥ * 1 * opu-rV n f | Regulation will be issued under Article 70 of the Order-in- Council without reference to a specific paragraph of that Article. 5.

I will only deal with the Regulation but it is probable that most of the observ tion* apply '-iut'tla ..utanals to the mnlamation Article 3 now gives a power to the political resident to grant a licence for the ia ortat on of arnie etc. query whether he should not have a po'&gt; er to grrnt a licence for their export f Iso* What is however to be the position 80 regards arris in Bahrein imported under a licence given under this article? is the licence to import to be deemed to be al^o a liccjnce to po seeaf in Bahrein equivalent to that which is given by the Govern ;ent of Bahrein under article 5 n Further if this is supposed to be the caae presumably such eras should be numbered and registered etc. Article 5, the second line, Regulation obviously must be substituted for proclamation. The Regulations seem to me to require an article stating expressly (what is now implicit) that it is forbidden to possess arms etc. in respect of which no licence Iv e been issued. According to whet is done on the in connection with article 3 on which 1 h* ve already observed, this new reticle might refer to licences issued by the Government of Bahrein under article o or those issued by the political resident under article o fit is to be noticed thft the authorities for giving licences and permission are already somewhat various* It is the political resident under article 3, the Government of Bahrein under article 5, acting apparently through the Chief of Police, and aregards the revocation at the end of article G it is the also. political a&amp;ent. If *. •If the political agent is being given a power to revoke licences (query whether thia applies only to licences issued under article 5 or whether it ft plies also to those issued under article 3) some provision r.iuat be made ne to wh? t is to happen with regard to the arms when the licence to possess them hss been revoked. as things stand it will be forbidden to export then and forbidden to transfer then and forbidden to keep thera. The man whose licence is revoked can pretunably only drop them in the bottoia of the sea, but is it right to give the political agent in this way power to take away from a man who has not been convicted of any offence what may be in money a fairly valuable property? I am afraid this point wants further consider* tion. I think it might be suggested also to the Indio Office th't in a case such as this a more convenient method is to draft the Government of Bahrein’s law or Proclamation containing the rules which apply to native subjects then make a King's Regulation to which the Government of Bahrein’s law is an annex. The King’s Regulation in these cases mokes the ex-Bahrein jurisdiction and adUiB such additional provisions as may be necessary to complete or modify the Regulation for the purposes of its application to these peroono. This is the normal way of dealing with local legislation in ex-territorial countries and it might conveniently be followed in Bahrein. One or two specimens of Morocco King’s Regulations are annexed tie an illustration of the way in which these things are usually done.(5^ -ft (14722) MOROCCO (SPANISH ZONE). NOTICE.

Your paragraph 3. I do not think that a King*s Regulation to which the local Proclamation is annexed would render more conspicuous to any extent the fact that the former contains a provision for the Political Ag®nt to grant import licenses while the latter contains no provision for the Ruler to do so, than the simultaneous publication of a King«s Regulation and a local Proclamation containing the same difference. The form suggested by the Foreign Office is both logical and convenient and, in my opinion, is preferable to that hitherto proposed. 4. With regard to the point you raise as to the undesirability of putting the power of granting a license for the importation of arms into the hands of the Ruler, he is presumably precluded from doing this by his Undertaking of 30th April 1898. sd.

In paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter, you raise a question regarding penalties which we had considered at an earlier stage and overlooked more recently. As you will see from paragraph 2 of our letter of 4th February, .No.P.Z.463/36 and enclosures, we were aware of the fact that we could not overrule the provisions of the Order in Council in regard to penalties by a King’s Regulation, and Article 12 of the old draft Regulation was worded accordingly. when the draft Regulation was recast in accordance with the more convenient method advocated by Beckett in his note of the 11th February, this point was I think overlooked* V/hat we want now is, I suggest, the following substitute ibr Article 1 (viii) of your revised draft T.V. Brenan Esq*, 0.3.E., Foreign Office. Regulation:-/ VI i I Regulation:- ’’Article 14 to 'be omitted and a new Article 15 to be inserted, reading as follows:- ’Any person failing to comply with the above rules will be liable , in addition to any penalty provided by or under the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, to forfeiture of the arms or firearms*'’. We concur in your revised draft Regulation, with this amendment. Colonel Powle, whom we have consulted, also concurs. As regards the point raised in the last paragraph of your letter, we agree that it is unnecessary to say anything. As regards paragraph 4 of your letter, we think it would be quite safe to substitute 'Regulation for 'Proclamation'. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) M. J. OLAUSOF® 7 , * ' 5 % (E 5887/37/91) P.Z. 7047/36.

The Drafts have been examined by Fitzmaurice (in the absence of Beckett) and he has thought it necessary to make a number of amendments in The King’s Regulation for reasons amendments in a fair draft, a copy of which I enclose. If you agree with them we can go ahead with the formal steps of allowing The King’s Regulation. It is usual to schedule the text of the local law made applicable to British subjects or other persons under British jurisdiction, so we have inserted a reference to the Schedule in paragraph 1« On the assumption that it is intended to issue the Proclamation and The King’s Regulation simultaneously, it may be preferable though perhaps not strictly necessary to substitute in The King’s Regulation the word 'Regulation' for 'Proclamation' in the proposed amendments to Article 5 of the Proclamation. We have made this amendment leaving it to yor to adopt or not as you see fit# As regards the provision permitting the Political Agenl in exceptional circumstances to grant a permit for the import or export of arms, what this regulation purports to do is to which are explained hereunder.

Clauson Esq#, India Office, S.W. 1apply the local law to persons subject to the Bahrain Order- in-Gouncil with certain amendments# The provision under discussion is an amendment of the law in question# It is in fact an additional provision# Consequently it ought not in our view, to be set out as a separate paragraph 2, but to be set out as No.(vii) in the amendments listed in paragraph 1# There also appears to be some confusion in the concluding words of this paragraph 2 of the India Office draft# Is it not sufficient simply to refer to Article 6 without stating that it is Article 6 of the Proclamation as modified in The King^ Regulation? What the Regulation is doing is infiict to modify the Proclamation, oefore making it applicable to persons subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council# Article 6 is therefore already modified and all that appears necessary is simply a reference to Article 6# Then paragraph 3 of the India Office draft seems to convey a false impression# In the first place, it reads as if forfeiture was not provided for in the Proclamation, but actually it is# This paragraph, therefore, does not add to the penalties provided for in the Order and, in our opinion, might well be omitted# In that case the penalty provision of the Proclamation will automatically apply as it stands to aiy person subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council. All that is necessary is to renumber the provision in question in view of the insertion of the new article (i.e# the article about import and export permits)# Similarly Article 15 will require renumbering# There is however one point about the penalty article which puzzles us# It seems to us that Article 71 of the Order-in-Council prescribes the maximum penalty thatmay be imposed fb r a breach of a King’s Regulation but that this maximum, which in the case of imprisonment is three months, applies even where the King’s Regulation enforces a local law/72' 3. law imposing a greater penalty# At least this seems to he the implication of Article 71(3) under which the maximum fine that could he inflicted as there provided, could not, it would seem, he exceeded even if the local law prescribed a greatermaximum# We notice that the proclamation in this case prescribes imprisonment up to one year and a fine up to 2,000 Rupees. Isthere not therefore a conflict between this and the Order- in-Council and do you not want to provide in the Regulation that the penalty article shall he aeleted am that the penalties prescribed in the Order-in-Council shall apply? The English text of the ^'oclamation will he set out in a schedule. Perhaps, it should, strictly speaking, he called an English translation instead of text# If you prefer, the word 'translation' would he substituted for 'text 1 in paragraph 1# The remaining amendments are, I think, self- explanatory# There is one further point. King’s Regulations often state that eny offences thereunder shall he triable only in British Consular Courts and not in any other Courts# As however the Arms Ordinance contains no specific statement that offences under that Ordinance shall he triable in the local courts and as persons subject to the Bahrain Order-ta- Council are thereby placed uni er the jurisdiction of British courts and are in any event not subject to local jurisdiction it is probably unnecessary to say anything about it# Yours, Ac., (Sgd.)

Dear Stewart, There has been some agitation about the arms and ammunition decree. A certain section of the Arabs mostly from Hedd, including a few from Muharraq have organised opposition to it. These people invariably stir up trouble whenever there is opportunity, their leaders are Ali bin Abdullah Abul, Ibrahim bin Jowdr, Mohomed bin Subah, Ahmad bin Ibrahim and Jabr bin Musallam. A public petition was written by them and other persons of less importance and was presented to His Excellency protesting against the Government taking away their arms and ammunition and leaving them defenceless like animals. One of the chief grievances is that the law does not apply to foreigners. It appears that only a very few people are aware that a similar order was issued in respect of foreigners. The public petition from the Arabs is entirely groundless because it is based upon the assumption that all arms are to be confiscated. Yesterday I attended a meeting of the Shia Wakf Committee consisting of notables from the towns and villages. I explained the matter to them and they all appeared to understand it and welcomed the regulation but they protested that such ———- 2 - such an order should be universal not only applying to Bahrain subjects. I told them that an order has been issued by the Agency. None of them knew of this and they asked that it should be made public because, as they said, the bad characters whose arms should be checked have in past almost always been Hassawis and Najdis — both foreigners. I think it is important that the Agency proclamation should be given full publicity as soon as possible as at present there is a misunderstanding on the subject which is causing a great deal of comment and which has resulted in the public being unwilling to start registering firearms. I have heard that leading Saoudi Arabian subjects have sent a copy of the proclamation to their Government and enquire whether they should obey it. Yours sincerely, Captain A.C.Stewart, I.A., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain.CONFlU.^iriAL. Rfi s Arms '^raffice H^gulation Sirace the issue of the , Arms Traffic Proclajnation* by the Bahrain (Government, the people of Bahrain (Arabs of Muhsrraq and Bidd and Baharnah of Manamah) have disagreed vath it^ Consequent on its issue, they have been holding meetings with a view to adopt some lines to avoid compliance with it, and especially the .Baharnah who have been holding meetings in the house of Abdur Rasul bin Rajab for the same purpose, hohsin al Tajir had been saying to the Baharnah villagers not to surrender any arms which they possessed Many deputations of Muhamraq and Hidd approached H.B.Shaikh Sir Hamad, the Adviser and Shaikh Abdallah requesting them to have this c&gt;rder cancelled. It is said that Shaikh Abduliah promised that he shall try to act to their v/ishes. I understand that upto no?/ none have come forward for a license with the exception of a few Hoiis of Manamah who did not even want to keep their arms with them. All the people are under the impression that if they take a license for their arms, they are afraid that next year the (Government may refuse to renew their license and consequently they will have to surrender them to the Government. I understand the Arabs of Muharraq are trying to incorporate the Baharnah with themselves.■Ml I An extract from Report dated the 15th February 1937 made by the Head Munshi, Bahrain.

The Qadhis convened their meeting yesterday the 15th February 1937 in the afternoon and discussed the foliowing matters: (3) Arms Question : This question was raised by Shaikh Abdullatif bin Jodar (of Muharraq) and seconded by Shaikh Abdullatif bin Mahmud (of Hidd) and the two Shi*ah Qadhis, Shaikh ! Ali bin Musa and Shaikh Baqir al Usfoor. They said that Arabs and Baharnah approached them on the question of arms and en listed their help. That they should join the people and help them in this matter as otherwise the people will also decline to help them (Qadhis) when necessity arises. Shaikh ’All bin Hasan and Shaikh *Abdullatif bin Sa f ad said that this was a case for the Government to deal with and the Shara 1 has nothing to do with it. They added that the Qadhis should not interfere in this case and each party should inform its followers that they (%adhis) have nothing tc do with the Arms question and that they were at liberty to do what they liked. *** *** *** (6) It is aaid that the Arabs of Muharraq met in Shaikh * Abdullah bin »Isa T s place at Muharraq and discussed the question of arms.

Abdur Rasul bin Rajab and f Ali bin Mansur of Bu Saiba* took cars and went out to the villages. It is said that their in tention of doing so was to see the villagers not to surrender their arms. \ oOoConfidential. I understand that there are some people of Manamah and Muharraq_ who are feeling a sore for the Arms Act promulgated in Bahrain. Almost all of them helong to the party that is apt to revolt when any reformation is introduced in the constitution of the State. It is further heard that a deputation consisting of those persons approached His Excellency the ShaiTch, some days had:. Possessers of arms in Bahrain are mostly Saudi Arabian subjects. Even a poor Najdi has some sort of arms. T have not heardso far anything from that quarter.Mi i°1 I.A. In continuation of my note of this morning.

Immediately after the departure of His Excellency from A1 Juhelat, Shaikh Muhammad hin T Isa was visited hy Haji Ahmad Salloom and afterwards hy Jahar hin Muhammad A1 Ammari and Muharak hin Shahin A1 Ammari.

Reference report of 16th February 1937. Mohsin al '^ajir and his comrades went to the following villages on that day and warned the villagers not to do anything about arms unless they are told to do so by them (Mohsin etcetera) Bu Saiba 1 • Barbar. 1 Aali. Buri. Karzakkan. Another meeting was held in Mohsin al Tajiks office on the 18th instant where Jabur al Musallam and Sayed Ibrahim bin Abdul Ghafur of Hidd were present. The Baharnah suggested that the -^rabs should also select eight persons as the Baharnah so as to represent them in all matters. The Arabs agreed to ao so. XXX XAn extract from Report dated the 24th February 1937 made by Head Munshi, Bahrain. Yesterday when I went to pay an * Id call on the Shia T h Qadhi, Shaikh T Ali bin Hasan al secretly mentioned to me the question of arms saying that the villagers are poor, that they are obedient to Government orders and that they are always ready to comply with any orders passed by the Government. He adaed that there are some mischief makers whose chief is Mohsin al Tajir who had on all occa sions opposed Government orders and tried to confuse the people ! s mind as he has done and is doing now in the case of arms. That he (Mohsin) does not miss any opportunity by propagating in any means possible. His joining with the Arabs and appointment by the Arabs of 8 persons to re present them in cases similar to that in which he is now involved is one that should be checked, lest that when the circle gets wider and wider then it would be difficult to deal with the general public most of whom are ignorant and innocent. That the root of these differences should be cut off and this can be done easily. That Mohsin al Tajir holds various honorary posts in Government offices, i.e. he is a member of the Baladiyah Majlis, Waqf Council, and ! Qanoon Majlis*. He is also one of the members selected by the Baharnah to represent them in their affairs to which the Bahrain Government has agreed that he should appear in various assemblies, but he has always abused his position and resisted Government orders on several occasions in the past. His punishment will be his dismissal from the above posts when the people will know that he is no longer a mem ber in Government offices and he automatically will desist from making intrigues. The leaders of the Arabs of Mttfcwr- raq anu Hidd are:- 1. Yusuf Fakhroo 2. l Ali bin Abdullah *Abul 3. Sayid Ibrahim bin Abdul Ghaffor.2. It is said that Shaikh ! Ali bin Hasan ai Musa, the Shia’h Qadhi, told all the headmen of the villages that they should not listen to Muhsin al Tajir and his friends because they are mischief-makers and that they should in form him as soon as they are approached by him or them in any question.■ © An extract from Report dated the 27th February 1957 made by the Head Munshi, Bahrain. (2) On 25th morning the Qadhis met in Shaikh Baqir T s house (ail the Qadhis Sunnis and Shia ! hs) on account of ’Id. bhaikh ’Abdul Latif bin Jodar of Muharraq raised again the question of arms and said that something should be done with a view to help the inhabitants in the matter. X X X X XXX On 25th February Shaikh ’Ali bin Hasan went to Buri and ’Ali villages and told the inhabitants not to listen to Mohsin at Tajir and his friends in connection with Arms. He toid them further that they should take their arms to the Government office where it will be registered and returned to them. They all agreed to do so but wanted to know as to how the arms should be delivered. He said he would see the Adviser and let them know.— wmmmmmmmmmmm — — An extract from Report dated the 3rd March 1937 made by the Head Munshi, Bahrain. 2. I understand that the Adviser has asked Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo to help in the question of arms; that he should approach the Baharnah and ask them to produce their arms. Yusuf Kanoo having no influence over the Baharnah, had gone to Haji ^Abdutii Nabi Bushiri and asked him to help in the matter. The latter, I understand, replied that he had nothing to do in the matter.CONFILiiuNTlAL. % I understana tnat in the evening of 3*3.3V K.S. Haji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo accompanied by Haji Abaun Nabi Busheri went to the village of Sanabis the Headman of which is one Ahmad bin Khamis. They asked che latter to help in telling the villagers to produce their arms; that Bin Kahmis replied that now-a-days he had no influence on the villagers on account of his financial circumstances ana that he dia not think that anyone would listen to him should he attempt to do anything. He said that he has only one rifle which he will send to the authorities concerned for registration. I heard that Mohsin al Tajir and his Banarnah friends and the Arabs of Muharraq intend to hold a meeting in Sa f ad bin Shamlan T s house at Umm al Hasam on Sunday the 7th instant. The Qaahis went to Hidd last night to visit Shaikh Abdul uatif bin Mahmud. b.3.37An extract from Report dated the 8th March 1937 made by the Head Munshi Bahrain. *#* *** 2. I hear that most of the villagers (the Baharnah) produced their arms in the Fort for registration. 3. I understand that the Adviser has asked Shaikh Ali bin Hasan (the chief Shi ! ah Qadhi) to summon the headmen of the villages on Thursday the 11th March 1937 when the Adviser himself will also be present. This is in connection with the Arms Regulation, I presume. —oOo— *I I t A '7 COKFIDEKTIAL. ^P.4. Reference report of 8th Larch 1937. All Headmen of the villages gathered in Shaikh 'Ali bin Hasan's house yesterday morning as invited by the latter. Haji Abdun 3\!abi Bushiri was also sent for by the Shaikh. B 0 th Shaikh 'Ali and Haji Abdun Nabi tried to persuade the Headmen to produce their arms for registration as early as possible, that they should always obey Government orders and that they should not listen to those intriguerswhose mere object is to misrepresent matters and involve others with themselves. All the villagers unanimously agreed to produce their arms and suggested that some honest and reliable persons may, with the approval of the Government, be nominated as representatives of the villagers, in order to convey real facts to them (villagersJwhen required hy the Government. Shaikh 'Ali said he would talk to the Adviser on the subject and that in future if they do not know anything they should refei? to him and he will tell them what to do. Lhey left at about noon promising that they will send their arms. Lohsin al xajir and his friends who failed to persuade the villagers not to produce their arms were shocked yesterday when they heard about the gathering in Shaikh , Ali's house. He (Mohsin), 1 understand, is now adopting another course. He invited yesterday, in his house, shaikh xvhalaf and Shaikh 'Abdullah the two ex-Qadhis who v/ere not on good terms with each other for a long time, with a view to making peace between them. His object of doing so, it is said, was merely to instigate Shaikh Khalaf who have a large numoer of Saharnah followers to tell them not to care for shaikh ‘ Ali bin Hasan if he tells them anything.
