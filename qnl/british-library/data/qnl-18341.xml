Samuel Hennell reports that, after a long and patient investigation, no doubt remains of the Agent's criminality in having taken and sold for his own benefit a gold watch belonging to the late Mr Tasker. Hennell states that, following instructions from Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia, Lieutenant-Colonel Justin Sheil, he has removed Mirza Mahmood from his position as Government Agent at Shiraz and has nominated Mirza Fusl Ollah as his replacement. Hennell encloses a copy of Sheil's letter of instructions, dated 8 October 1850. The enclosure is not included, but Sheil's letter does appear earlier in the file (see ff.181-185).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00004b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
