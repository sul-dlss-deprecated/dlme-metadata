Age 55. Health good. Professional knowledge sound. He has under him a Compounder (post vacant, as incumbent is not returning after leave. I have written to the Political Agent, Bahrain, about a man here to fill the post). Dresser and sweeper. Both are healthy and good workers. , Comments . A well kept Dispensary and the Medical Officer takes a gre^t deal of interest in looking after it. It is we^I equipped and has a good stock of drugs. (2) Duildin.s . (a) The Dispensary and Medical Officer s house are in the same building, the former on the ground floor and the latter on the 1st floor. It is a stone and mud building white-washed and colour-washed. The floors of the consulting room and dressing room are cement rubbing which gives the appearance of marble ruDoing. The walls up to a height of 4 feet are covered with the same material. An ideal floor washable and can be kept very clean. The ward floors are cement and so is the dispensary flora'. All in good condition. Electrically lit, no cooling system in use. The rooms are large about 18 feet square in the consulting room and dressing room. The wards are one 14 feet square the other slightly smaller. The larger has 6 beds and the smaller 4. The consulting room and dressing room have porcelain washing basins with running hot and cold water tans oi approved opera tion room type, i.e. can be turned on and off with the elbows when the hands are sterilized. Th ere is a hot wat er_apparatus with pump housed in a separate room for this purpose. All rooms are kept very clean and tidy. Government property. Comments. in excellently kept Dispensary. / (b)/ 7 2 (1j) Staffs houses . Medical Officer’s house composed of floor above Dispensary. I saw only the drawing and dining rooms and 'both looked good and sufficient. 3. films . I did not go into the question as to whether the furniture was private or G-cverament property, but will do so. 4. DHJGS . Sufficient .and well maintained. The stock in hand is compatible with the supplies from India, but the Medical Officer is able to purchase some necessary drugs locally. All poisons are locked in an almirah and the key kept by the Medical Officer. i 5 # AiTEMDifrCE AMD vVOEK PARRIED OUT AT TED DISPMNSARY.

(b) In-patients treated - 14 (c) Minor operations 0 535 Major operations 0 (d) Number of Europeans and American subjects Comments . As previous years Annual Reports are not available no reasons can be given as to any increase or decrease in the above figures. The Medical Officer stated that the attendances were the same as usual. 6. Whether the medical officer has any private practice and if so approximate number of visits, etc., during previous five years. The Medical Officer has some private practice. I don’t think either he or previous Medical Officers ever kept records of this practice. Even when asked about private practice, the answer has always been more or less evasive. treated - 101 (e) Number of British Indian subjects (Hindus) treated - 148 (f) Number of Bahrainis treated - 19367.I ; TO// -/ a j;!( - 3 - 7. PHhlVALiilNT DISEiiSES . Malaria Mye diseases Digestive diseases Respiratory diseases These diseases are general all over the East. Anti-malarial measures are adopted to lessen the incidence e.g. mosquito nets, oiling of stagnant pools, iish for destruction of Mosquito larvae and anti-malarial drugs. These measures have 'been adopted hy the Bahrain G-overnment. 8. ffMADCE Of DISPENSARY . funds allotted hy the Political Agency. Rs 1,597/- utilized last year. The Medical Officer did not complain of any shortage, as whenever any repairs are needed or extra drugs required the Political Agent, Bahrain, supplies the funds. I would like to have the opinion of the Political Agent, Bahrain, as to whether the merchants would he ready to 'give monthly or yearly subscriptions, as I do not know them well enough. The present building in which the Dispensary is situated does not lend itself to further expansion, as more / rooms added on would make it too congested. Upmments . The wards should have matting laid down and a good lavatory and bath-room constructed for the use of the European in-patients. One of the v/ards is rather dark. It could be made more cheerful with better light. 9. GENERAL COMMENTS . This Dispensary is the best in the Gulf and run on well organized lines. The Medical Officer takes great interest in his work. The Political Agent is ever ready with funds for repairs and medicines. QUARANTINE SIRTION . 10. bliiff.
