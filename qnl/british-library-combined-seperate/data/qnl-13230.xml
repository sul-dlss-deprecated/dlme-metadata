There is an index of the confidential subject letters on folio 3.

The main list in the file (folios 4-78) includes columns for the serial number (the confidential subject letter and an incremental number), the file/volume number (derived from the A and B series), the file title, and the date range associated with the file. The key to bound files lists those A series files by file number that were classed confidential, alongside their corresponding confidential serial number. Folios 98-102 contain miscellaneous lists and notes, including a list of cypher files (folio 98), opium files (folio 99), a list of confidential files from the old system (folio 100). Folio 101 is an instruction, dated 12 February 1941, to destroy by fire certain files upon the departure of the Resident on tour. Folio 102 is a list of confidential files destroyed at Bahrain in February 1941.A typewritten note at the front of the file (folio 2) states that files marked with a red cross were destroyed in September 1939 (at the beginning of the Second World War) on the Political Resident’s orders. The note also states that files marked with a blue pencil ‘B’ have been retained at Bushire (the date of the note, 1 June 1947, coincides with the Residency’s relocation from Bushire to Bahrain.While the bulk of the index is typewritten, there are significant handwritten additions throughout, marked in black, red and blue pencil, and black/blue ink. There are handwritten additions to many of the lists, indicating new files opened after the creation of the index. Other annotations indicate changes to the status of files, including destruction, thinning, weeding, and consolidation. Some of these actions are dated 1954, after the transfer of the files to the Foreign Office. The key to bound files (folios 77-97) also contains extensive annotations, with red crosses indicating the destruction of files.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022598736.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
