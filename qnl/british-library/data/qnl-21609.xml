SIMLA: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRESS, 1918.I / # ♦ ■■Li ■CONFIDENTIAL. (Diary No. 42260.) No. 1124-10-G., dated Aden, the 15th May 1918. From—The General Officer Commanding, Aden Field Force, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, Simla. ' With reference to your No. 19196-1, dated 17th April 1918, I have the honour to forward herewith an additional paragraph to my despatch of 18th February 1918, bringing the account of operations at Aden up to the 31st March 1918. This paragraph should be inserted in the despatch as paragraph 7, the remaining paragraphs being re-numbered accordingly. 2. I also enclose an amended table showing the total casualties of the force up to the 31st March 1918. 3. I have no further names to bring forward for mention in despatches or specific reward beyond those mentioned in the despatch under reference and my telegram No. 1588-C. of the 3rd May 1918. Copy forwarded to— The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office. 7. During the months of February and March, we continued to harass the enemy by similar enterprises, but the quarantine of a newly arrived battalion and subsequently the relief of the islands garrison and the necessity, on medical advice, of bringing the British battalion into Aden reduced the infantry available for such operations. A number of successful skirmishes took place in which losses were inflicted on the enemy, while demonstrations compelling him to man his trenches and give a target to our artillery were regularly carried out. Probably owing to the activity of our aeroplanes and the increased efficiency of our artillery in co-operation with them it became increasingly difficult to get the enemy to leave his main defences, though these were still strongly held and artillery support amply forthcoming when occasion demanded. During April the metalled road was completed alongside the railway Id miles beyond Eobat. Working parties were regularly shelled at long range with little effect, but the enemy made no other attempt to prevent the work proceeding. On the 19th February, I proceeded to Egypt to see the High Commissioner on political affairs concerning the Yemen and Eed Sea littoral. I returned to my Command on the 11th March.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x0001db_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/10</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x0001db</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/10</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Despatch by Major-General J.
