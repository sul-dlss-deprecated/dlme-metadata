From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour t to recall that one of the items, which, in a personal communi cation to you when in Calcutta, I included in a list of desiderata which, I considered, should be sought from the Persian Government by friendly means as opportunity offered, was the general recognition of our prescriptive right to control buoyage and lighting in the Gulf. , 2. On the one hand, it seems possible that a suitable opportunity for obtaining this recognition (which we have already sought from the Porte) may occur in the early future in connection with the grant of a fresh loan to Persia ; on the other hand, there are some grounds to fear that if we are not soon in the field with a friendly demand in the direction referred to, we may be baulked from making it by some pretentious communication from the Persian Government on the subject ^ of lights or buoys in their waters. 3 I have specific reasons for this apprehension in that at a recent meeting with the Governor of the Gulf Ports (Mowaqqer-ed-Dowleh), His Excellency as 1 -ed me the facts regarding the reported erection of a light-house at lamb, and the location of lighted buoys at Bushire; he enquired, at the same time, what decision had eventually been arrived at in the case of the proposed light-house on Shaikh Shuaib. None of these topics had previously been touched upon between US. . As regards Tamb, I informed him that, with the concurrence of the Shaikh of Shareah we were about to put up a bght there to facilitate navigation. The only remark His Excellency had to make in this connection was to say that there was noToubt that the island properly belonged to Persia and that they had to thank the blatant action of the Customs in 1904 for spoiling their case m regard tSo I reioked that we considered, on the other hand, that it was beyond doubt that the Shaikh of the Jowasim of Oman owned the island, and as m d-a in 0 S this question we had to reckon with patent facts, it seemed waste of time for us to discuss the question now. j i-i iiWLfor! Vmov«i I informed him that I understood that our As regards the hg t y j s q 110 y S a t the two anchorages, in order Marine ^^'^kfies fofshks Sg the harbour.

S'Ar.r.CU.at Za.

The absence of such notification having actually become a cause of complaint on the part of German ships, there appears to Sir E.

WITH reference to Sir Percy Cox’s despatch No. 13, dated the 13th December y 1912, I have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of the letters which I have addressed to the Government of India in regard to the notification to foreign consular representatives and local Government officials of the aids to navigation maintained by His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. S. G. KNOX, Major, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and PLis Majesty’s Acting Consul-General for Ears, &amp;c. \ Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Major Knox to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, April 11, 1914. I HAVE the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Sir Percy Cox’s letter dated the 17th July, 1913, in which was enclosed a copy of a communication made to foreign consuls in regard to certain items of the lighting and buoying scheme. 2. Since that date the scheme has moved forward nearly to completion, and at present there only remain unestablished the two lights for the telegraph stations at Henjam and Chahbar, the provision of which was urged on Government in the late Mr. J. G. Lorimer’s letter No. 201, dated the 24th January, 1914, and the lighthouse at Sheikh Shu‘aib, the question of which is understood to be in abeyance. I attach for facility of reference a table (Appendix (A) ) showing all the items of lighting and buoying now standing to our credit in the Gulf, those which have been notified to foreign consuls, and those which have not as yet been notified. 3 . It will be seen that no mention has been made of any of the aids to navigation established at the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab. It has been thought that, in view of the negotiations in progress with the Turkish Government, it will probably be considered inconvenient to draw attention to these undertakings just yet. The same inconvenience may perhaps attach to the Koweit aids to navigation, and I would ask that the point may be considered. In case, however, it should appear to Government that any advantage would be gained by publicly emphasising tbe very predominantly British character of the lighting and buoying arrangements of the bhatt-el-Arab, a list of the aids to navigation which have been established there by the British Government is attached (Appendix (B) ). _ , . 4 . The table of items mentioned as “ already notified in Appendix (A) was communicated at Bushire to the consular representatives of Russia, Germany, Fiance, Norway, Holland, and Turkey, all of whom acknowledged its receipt, and, as far as is known here, no exception has been taken to it. Copies were also communicated to foreign consular representatives at Muscat, Bunder Abbas, and Eingah, and evoked no protest. _ j , .. Our position is therefore the stronger by eight months of uncontested, though publicly notified, activity, and I now venture to propose that Government should authorise me to issue a further communication to foreign consular representatives throughout the Gulf, bringing the previous one up to date. [2133 6—2]wmem. 5. I would at the same time venture to invite attention to the steps contemplated in paragraph 7 of Sir Percy Cox’s letter dated the 13th December, 1912, viz., the notification to the local Government and to the Customs Department of the establish ment and maintenance by His Majesty’s Government of gas-buoys at Bushire and Bunder Abbas, to which we must now add the Bas-al-Marg beacon and the ResidencyAv I flag-staff lights. His proposals were supported in his Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram of the 7th January, 1913, to the SecretaTy of State for India, and in the latter’s letter of the 17th January, 1913, to the Foreign Office. The authority, however, conveyed in Sir W. Townley’s telegram No. 171, dated the 25th April, 1913, limited, hut without stating reasons, our action to the issue of a notification to foreign consuls. I cannot, however, refrain from pointing out that the notification of an almost complete list of our arrangements to foreign consuls, and a simultaneous notification of a very limited nature to the local Government and Customs administration, is sure to raise comment, and perhaps support the unfavourable inference that we are afraid of notifying the Persian Government of the steps we have been taking in other directions. There seems to be no logical reason why we should be less explicit to the Persian Government than we are to other Powers. 6. Should these proposals meet with approval, I would also ask that, until the lighting and buoying arrangements in the Persian Gulf are handed over to the Director Royal Indian Marine, as they will be shortly, under the instructions conveyed in your letter dated the 10th June, 1913, I may be authorised to issue notifications, as may from time to time be necessary, as regards all petty changes of position, casualties, &amp;c., to foreign consuls and to the local Government and Persian Customs, in the same way and of the same character as I shall issue them to the officers serving under me for the information of British shipping. In this connection I would invite reference to my 7 first assistant’s letter, dated the 22nd February, 1914, as setting forth an example of an incident, the recurrence of which under less fortunate circumstances might afford an inconvenient handle to adverse foreign criticism, possibly action. 7. It will therefore be seen that the actions for which the permission of Government is sought are :— (1.) To notify such aids to navigation as may have been established since the issue of the previous notification to foreign consular representatives. (2.) To issue a complete notification to the local Government and Customs authorities in Persia. (3.) J o communicate marine intelligence in connection with the lighting and buoying scheme to foreign consular representatives and to the local Government and Customs authorities in Persia. 8 . I have ventured to send a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Foreign and India Offices, and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. ^ ^ 9.

IN connection with the subject of my immediately preceding letter of to-day's late, I hare the honour to submit to Government a point which appe direct i y nterest, that is, the distinction between the notification of ch^ g we are dfect the lighting and buoying arrangements in the Persian 9 ulf : sunken •esponsible, fnd the notification of information of interest to n |. vl § a ^°'’, SU A ^ - A’s weeks, formation of shoals, approach of typhoons, &amp;c„ regarding which H,s Majesty sconsular officers serving in the Gulf have occasionally to inform British shipping i n their vicinity. It appears to me that, as a matter of international comity, and on account of the predominant character of British shipping in the Gulf, which puts British consuls in a more favourable position to receive information of this character our foreign colleagues are, in courtesy, entitled to receive from us such information of' ■ this character as we issue to British shipping. But whereas information of the first kind should, in my opinion, be communicated officially on account of our direct responsibility in the matter, it appears to me desirable to emphasise the distinction I have drawn above by the consul concerned sending to his foreign colleague “informally, in case it may prove of interest,” a copy of the notification that he is issuing to British shipping firms. The occasions for such communications are not frequent, would involve little extra labour, and would, I think be appreciated. The procedure is, however, at any rate at Bushire, an innovation’ and I hesitate to introduce it without knowing that my views, as I have given them above, are approved by higher authority. I have ventured to send a copy of this letter to His JMaiesty^s Foreign and Tnrhn Offices, and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Should this letter be printed, I beg that I may be supplied with fifteen copies of it. I have, &amp;c. S. G. KNOX,^ Major, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. UConfidential.

At the end of January it was suggested to the Foreign Office by the India Office that Foreign Consuls should be notified at once about the new gas buoys at Bandar Abbas and Bushire and the dioptric lanterns at Bushire.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department To—The Director of the Royal Indian Marine. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 907, dated # the 11 th February 1913, in which you propose that the Director of the Roval Indian Marine should be authorised to pay visits of inspection to the Persian Gulf, whenever he considers it necessary to do so in connection with the lights and buoys that are being established in that locality and when he can arrange with the Political Resident for the loan of the Persian Gulf despatch vessel or the light-house tender, when the latter is built. 2 . In reply, I am to say that the Government of India sanction the pro posal, the expenditure involved in each case being debited to the Royal Indian Marine estimates. 3. I am to add that intimation should he sent to the Government of India whenever the Director of the Royal Indian Marine proposes to pay visits of inspection to the Persian Gulf. No, 907, dated Bombay, the 11 th February 1913. From The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. I have the honour to bring to your notice that the recently app-rovpd and partially installed scheme of lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf has involved the Director of the Royal Indian Marine in a large amount of details, interest, and responsdbilitjv-iji^idir^^ of whaj/ may now he termed Indian Waters (though according to ruling contained in Appendix XXII, para graph 70, Rule 3, Marine Regulations, India, Volume I, Part I, page 261, it is outside the Indian limit), and it is desirable that the Director should have as intimate a knowledge as possible of the localities and conditions that pr^vaiil~vn^nnd_aho«t the various places where light vessels, houses and buovs are to he located. J It is also in the interests of the scheme that he should be as much in touch with Sir P. Z. Cox (the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) as possible, as, from the nature of the scheme and the political situation on which it hinges, the administration and control of the lighting scheme must of necessity be one of a dual nature between the Resident and the Director. —_ I, therefore, have the honour to propose that the Persian Gulf in general should from the present date he considered as a touring area for the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who should pay occasional visits there, at times when his other various and numerous responsibilities allow him to do so, and when he can arrange with the Resident for the loan of the Persian Gulf despatch vessel or light-house tender when it is built. With a view to obtaining a personal acquaintance with this district and a personal discussion on the whole matter with Sir P. Z. Cox, I have, in anti cipation of appioval of the Government of India, arranged with that officer for the loan of the R.I.M S. “ Lawrence ” during the month of March to visit the places on the annexed programme, on or about the dates tabulated. /114 Telegram, No. 21 —47 T., dated the 25th February 1913.

A suitable candidate, however, offers at Rs. 25 per mensem, and as this sum is less than any for which the Director, Royal Indian Marine, would be likely to be able to obtain a suitable man in Bombay, I have engaged the man in question, and I trust that Government will be pleased to approve my action. t Telegram, No. 166, dated the 28th February 1913.

I am informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a light-house is beino* erected by the Government of India on Tamb Island, and be represents that the ownership of this island by the Shaikh of Shargah is contested by the Persian Government. From the correspondence in the archives I see that when in 1905-06 the Question was raised here, it would seem to have been shelved after your visit to the island and your disproval of the statement that buildings were in course of erection there. I should be glad of your views on the subject. I am informed that you have been in communication with the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Telegram P., No. 88—325, dated the 23rd February 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. Your Excellency’s telegram No. 65. Owin 0, to my absence reply has been delayed. Please see paragraph 3 of mv letter &amp; No 2575, dated 13th October 1912, to the Government of India (enclosure to my despatch No. 69) for nature of my conversation with the Governor. He mentioned to me more recently in private conversation that he would have to make a reference on the subject to Tehran. 1 answered that that was his affair, but that the ownership of Tamb was not open to question as far as I was concerned.I would also invite reference to my letter No. 3314, dated 13th December to the Government of India regarding the light-house (forming enclosure to mv despatch to you, No. 95 of same date). Since the correspondence of 3 905 the subjects of the Shaikh of Sharjah and his flag have remained established on the island undisturbed, and 1 would strongly urge that we should decline to re-open the question of owner ship now. No doubt if we did, we should revive the question of Sirri (vide warnino* referred to in Sir A. Hardinge’s despatch No. Ill dated 20th Julv 3904, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office). I venture, however, to think that a flat refusal to re-open the question would best meet the case now. It is now live months since the light-house was landed on the island, and for the past five weeks our engineer has been engaged in its erection.

Following from His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran, 97 of 11 th March :— c&lt; Following is result of the negotiations connected with the lighting and buoying of the Gulf which I have been carrying on with the Persian Government: ‘Reference lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. Minister for Foreign Aflairs has submitted memorandum which he says contains the utmost he has been able to get the Cabinet to accept. Following is a summary. “ ( 1 ) Persian Government is disposed to cause light-houses to be built and buoys to be placed on or in neighbourhood of certain Persian islands to he determined upon later in agreement with the British Government on the following conditions :—Firstly, British engineers shall be engaged by Persia to carry out construction of light-houses. Secondly, on completion of the construction the working and maintenance of the apparatus will be entrusted to British employes specially engaged for the purpose. Thirdly, should the Persian Government require funds to meet expenses to be incurred His Majesty s Government will be asked to make the necessary advance. Fourthly, interest and amortization of such advance will be met by tolls leviable from shipping. I rather gather vagueness of detail is intentional in order to leave us a free hand without appearing to do so. I said I would submit scheme, but I held out no hope of it being found acceptable. I am repeating second part of above to Bushire.’ ” Cabinet will not enter into any negotiations connected with policing and demand that other points raised in your telegram 37 as modified by Government of India telegram 50 C. repeated to me in your telegram No. 46 shall stand over until a Medjliss is assembled.

Townley to support the Russian demand for the Urmia Lake concession, bnt I hope that M. Sazonof will give effect to onr request respecting the Russian lights at Bushire. (Repeated to Tehran, No. 170.)f c I see no objection to our supporting the Russian demand. I have already said, in answer to enquiries of various Ministers, that I believe Russian Government attach great importance to the granting of this concession, which should present certain advantages to Persia in that it should serve to develop trade interests of district concerned. I gather that it will meet with very considerable opposition. Ministers argue that it cannot have a great value until the railway is made, and that its nego tiation can very well be postponed until the Medjliss reassembles. I have no reason to believe that there is any active Russian opposition here to British schemes beyond that I think it is known that Russia has made friendly [?] remonstrances in London concerning both Mohammerah Railway and the mining concession. Such action on their part is calculated to help rather than to hinder us, because Persian suspicion of Russia is very deep-rooted. Occasion might be used to make further representations about the needless hoisting of lights at Russian consulate-general at Bushire, about which I am in receipt of tg r011 P ’undecypherable] telegrams from British consul-general, who considers moment favourable for reopening question consequent upon change of the Russian consular authority following the suicide of the author of the idea of hoisting lamps. Russian charge d’affaires mentioned the other day that his Government thought granting of the Urmia concession might well synchronise with the granting to us of the Kerman mining concession.

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Political Secretary India Office, London.Ur iZ CONFIDENTIAL. Cr^, No. 2575, dated Bushire, the 13th (received 21st) October 1912. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to recall that one of the items, which, in a personal communi cation to you when in Calcutta, I included in a list of desiderata which, I considered, should be sought from the Persian Government by friendly means as opportunity offered, was the general recognition of our prescriptive right to control buoyage and lighting in the Gulf. 2. On the one hand, it seems possible that a suitable opportunity for obtaining this recognition (which we have already sought from the Porte) may occur in the early future in connection with the grant of a fresh loan to Persia ; on the other hand, there are some grounds to fear that if we are not soon in the field with a friendly demand in the direction referred to, we may be baulked from making it by some pretentious communication from the Persian Government on the subject of lights or buoys in their waters. 3. I have specific reasons for this apprehension in that at a recent meeting with the Governor of the Gulf Ports (Mowaqqer-ed-Dowleh), His Excellency asked me the facts regarding the reported erection of a light-house at Tamb, and the location of lighted buoys at Bushire; he enquired, at the same time, what decision had eventually been arrived at in the case of the proposed light-house on Shaikh Shuaib. None of these topics had previously been touched upon between us. As regards Tamb, I informed him that, with the concurrence of the Shaikh of Shargah, we were about to put up a light there to facilitate navigation. The only remark His Excellency had to make in this connection was to say that there was no doubt that the island properly belonged to Persia and that they had to thank the blatant action of the Customs in 1904 for spoiling their case in regard thereto. I rejoined that we considered, on the other hand, that it was beyond doubt that the Shaikh of the Jowasim of Oman owned the island, and, as in dealing with this question we had to reckon with patent facts, it seemed waste oi time foi us to discuss the question now. As regards the lighted buoys, I informed him that I understood that our Marine authorities did intend to place gas buoys at the two anchorages, in order to improve the facilities for ships making the harbour. He then asked who was going to pay for their cost and up-keep. I replied that we should do so as we were doing and always had done in the case of other buoys laid for the benefit o navigation in the Gulf. As regards the proposed light for Shaikh Shuaib, I said that I had heard no more about it and supposed the idea had been given up, for the present at all events. He said “What would such a light-house cost to erect, only about £2,000 1 under stand ? ” I replied “ Nearer £9,000. ” Then we went on to other subjects. Judging from the above conversation, I think it possible that the Governor may, in order to earn merit with the central authorities, suggest their asserting themselves in connection with the location of buoys in Persian waters. 4 I have thought it advisable to place Government in possession of the pre cise local position fully by letter, and have forwarded a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s Minister, but if the Government of India endorse my view as to the advisability of obtaining formal recognition from the Persian Government, and if loan negotiations are current, they will perhaps see fit to deal with the question by telegraph. ’ 1v &gt; No. 3107 of 1910.
