The letter outlines Syed's recent travels, and ultimate desire to travel to Mecca.The focus of the letter is however his attempt to freight dates from Bushire to Hodeida [Al-Ḥudaydah] in the Red Sea. It explains how this cargo was effectively taken from him at Assiloo, and how Syed Humza proceeded to Bushire to seek redress from the Resident for the loss. It states therefore that the Resident has made a representation on his behalf to the Shaikh of Assiloo [Bandar-e ‘Asalūyeh], and that he further intends to take the case to the Shiraz Government; it is noted Syed Humza has returned to Muscat in the meantime.Enclosed with the letter is a statement of expenses for Syed Humza and his attendants from 25 April to 10 July 1824.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000005#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
