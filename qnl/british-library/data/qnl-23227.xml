It has been fairly general unofficial knowledge that the local Saudi officials in A1 Khobar and Dahran resented the erection of the mark on one of the two islands called the Bainain. There is no island between Bahrain and Hasa which is known locally as Libainaf and presumably the present objection by the Saudi Government is in respect of either Bain-al-Kebir or Bain-as-3aghir.

My dear Baggallay, ^ Please refer to your letter of the 20th December (7298/1154/91’) about the disputed ownership of an island? or tw'o islands, lying between Bahrein and the mainland. In the aosence 01 any further information v/e should have felt disposed to agree with you that as the next step che political Agent might be asked to find out from the local Saudi authorities what precisely is the territory. ,&lt;e have, however, as I mentioned to you recently, certain additional information indicating that the Saudi claim is m respect of one island only, viz. the island on which a mark has been put up by the Bahrein Government? that this mark, which is described as an empty painted barrel is understood to have been erected in June last or thereabouts, and that the island, referred to as ^1 Lubainah, is said to be &lt;.,. 0 Out 7 miles from the mainland and 9 miles from Bahrein. This/ H. L. Baggallay, ^sq. , Foreign Office.J. ft QiB$©&amp; 2 . This information, which reaches us from a reliable source, confirms the political Agent’s suspicion that the island in question is Bain-as-Saghir. although of courue we cannot make use of this information officially there seems in the light of it no necessity for the suggested meeting between Teightman and the local Saudi representative, and indeed it might cause embarrassment by provoking a dispute over the ownership of Bain-al-Kebir also. In the circumstances we think we might safely deal with the Saudi Government on the assumption that it is the island Bain-as-Saghir that is in question, and if you agree we suggest that Bullard might be asked to reply that it is assumed that the Saudi Government refer to the islet known locally as Bain-as-3aghir, that this islet lies within the territorial waters of Umn Na’san island, which belongs to Bahrein, and that in the view of Kis lajesty’s Government the Bahrein Government acted properly and within their rights in erecting a visible sign of their ownership on it.P. ...8508/38.

He claimed that the Saudi Government had a right to both islands under the ordinary rules of inter national law* but said that if His Majesty^ Government * to avoid the possibility of disputes* would care to divide the islands by drawing a line midway between Bahrain and the mainland* his Government would probably agree, 4, A map was produced by Shaikh Yusuf which he said had been made by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. It had obviously been prepared for the occasion* as it showed nothing but Bahrain* the mainland* snd the three islands of Umn Na’san* Libaina al Saghir and Libaina al Kabir. Remember ing the Saudi protest when His Majesty's Government kept C.A.S.O.C. informed of the position of the frontier question, I upbraided Shaikh Yueuf with pretended seriousness for allowing private persons - foreigners to boot - to have knowledge of a matter which ought to have been kept confid ential between the two Governments. Shaikh Yusuf allaged that C.A.G.O.C. had been asked to make a map but had no knowledge of the season* but in view of the nature of the map I think we may conclude that the management of C.A.S.O.C.* who already seem to regard British 'imperialism” with a critical eye* have been admitted to the confidence of the Saudi Government in this matter. In any case the distance between Umm Na'san and Libaina al Daghlr will have been calculated by American* not Saudi engineers. 6.

It appears# after investigation# that the ialand to which the Saudi Arabian Government refer is a small island whose local name is Bein al Saghir.

Dear Sir Trenehard, 4 % (ptJr Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 383-3 dated the 27th April 1939 in regard to the Bainain ? 2« I am afraid I have delayed my reply to your letter y but I did not wish to discuss this matter with any one in Bahrain until Ibn baud’s visit was over 5 and also I was waiting for a sloop to come in, in the hope of getting a chart from them* Actually we have not had a sloop in for some time, but so far as I can discover there are no accurate large scale charts of the sea between Bahrain and the Saudi Coast from Oqair to A1 Khobar* 3. From information which I have now received, this appa rently minor matter of the Bainain is likely to become part of a very much more important question* I gather that there is likely to be rapid technical advance in oil exploitation in shoal waters in the near future (made possible by improved geophysical methods of exploration) and the California Company intend to be in the van. The two offsprings in the Gulf, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, are preparing for shoal water exploration to a distance of several miles from the Coast, including areas as far as the Rennie and Bu Athama shoals* 4* I am writing this letter in rather a hurry as I leave for Hasa tomorrow for five days, so I have not had time to look up previous discussions about international rights and how they can be established beyond the three mile limit, but I think it is/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.K., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buahlre .6 /- - 2 - la right that you should have this inforaation at once 9 par ticularly since it has an important bearing on the Bainain question* It is obviously desirable that our views on that question should be so framed that they can do no damage to Bahraini prospects of sharing fully in any profits which may accrue from developments occurring in the outside shoal waters* 5* Reasonably close in to the Bahrain coast there are convenient exposed humps on the main shoals 9 e*g* the Fasht al * Jarim, Khor Fasht and Fasht al Jlbal 9 which have been claimed for Bahrain by the erection of marks* With the exception of the Bainain no objection has been raised by any other party and we may presume therefore that no one is likely to dispute Bahrain's right to grant an oil concession covering these reefs and shoals* Further out however y few, if any 9 of the shoals show above water at any state of the tide, — though they may be equally interesting from an oil point of view* North and west of Bahrain I do not think we need anticipate that any oil company other than the California Company and its subsidiaries will attempt to work, and consequently com mercial competition will not in this area introduce complica tions* Fortunately also relations between Ibn Saud and Bahrain are excellent, and though Ibn Saud will naturally be anxious that the Arabian subsidiary should exploit as much of the shoal area as possible (and pay the royalties to him), it seems to me that the present is an excellent opportunity to mark off what one might call 'spheres of influence' 1 for Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and their concessionaires respectively* I think therefore that there is a great deal to be said for following up the suggestion made by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin for 'drawing a line midway between Bahrain and the mainland' - and then pro ducing it indefinitely to the north*2 -3~ / 6* To revert now to the apeciflc question of the Balnain* Bain as Saghir is unquestionably outside the territorial waters of Umm Nasan. I personally have no doubt about the substantial accuracy of the Oil Company^ map to which you refer in paragraph 2(i) of your letter, since their other hydrographic work has been proved to be extremely accurate, and their barge traffic between A1 Khobar and Zellaq depends on this particular map # On the other hand Bain as Saghir is not in the territorial waters of Ibn Saud. The pieces of reef to which Shaikh Yusuf Yasin refers are largely imagi nary (except close to the Saudi coast) and it is Just as impossible for the Saudis to take three mile Jumps from Coast to reef to Bain as Saghir as it is for Bahrain. It is quite true, as Yusuf Yasin says, that there is a fairly deep water channel between Umm Nasan and Bain as Saghir and this is the normal course followed hy country craft going to Oqair. But there is also comparatively deep water on the mainland side of Bain as Saghir which can be seen clearly from the air when one flies over this area, as I have done myself. This being the case it might well be held that Bahrain, by erecting their marks on Bain as Saghir (and Bain al Kabir also) in the early spring of 1938 have established their claim by the erection of a 'national H mark on each of them. I find also that in letter No, 207 of the 4th April 1909 the then Political Agent, Bahrain, mentions that the Shaikh of Bahrain took in those days a tax from all boats which collected turtle shells on Labainat Al Aliya and Labainat Al Safliya, as the Bainaln were then known. But in view of the possible development in shoal waters to which I have referred above it may suit % Bahrain better to compromise over the Bainain in order to avoid future difficulties to the north* I feel quite certain that/-that the Shaikh himself would be delighted to do so (in fact I was afraid that Ibn Saud might raise the question when he was here and that the Shaikh would at once abandon his claim to both islets)* Personally I would recommend that we should try to get Bain as Saghir for Bahrain and leave Bain al Kabir to Arabia y and then take a line as near due north as we can get it from the eastern edge of Bain al Kabir* I am afraid I cannot at this moment show my ideas fully on a chart but if you think that the general idea is worth following up I will send for some copies of Admiralty Chart No* 2837b and show my suggested line on it. The line would begin well to the south of Bahrain Island* 7* Meanwhile the Bahrain Petroleum Company are anxious to go ahead at once with triangulating the Additional Area, prior to the conclusion of the new Lease* It 90 happens that they have an expert survey party available very shortly (the party that was on the Saudi Arabia • Iraq boundary survey) if they can get on to this work at once it will save much time in subsequent geological and geophysical work in the area* The Bahrain Government are perfectly prepared to allow them to do so, and since it is mapping work only I see no reason why we should object to the general plan* It involves only erecting concrete platforms as bases for instruments on certain of the Islands and reefs where the Bahrain Government marks already exist, together with ''targets 71 on others* I have made it clear that the party must not on any account land on Bain as Saghir or Bain al Kabir - or even at Hawar for the time being; but otherwise I see no ham in their working on this triangulation inside the area enclosed in the lines marked on the Bahrain Government's rough sketch attached to your Express letter No* C/331 dated the 7th May 1938* This work in fact might be extremely useful to us, for inevitably the Bahrain Petroleum ompany will ask for a definition of the boundaries of the Unallotted /•Unallotted Area on the eastern side of Bahrain. (On this side, owing to the hostility that exists both between Bahrain and Qatar and between the respective oil concessionaires, there can be little hope of defining n spheres of Influence” such as I have suggested for the other side.) At present there are no accurate charts showing the position of the various islets on the eastern side of Bahrain, to which the Bahrain Government have established a claim by the erection of marks; and since the eastern boundaries must presumably be fixed with strict reference to the limits of territorial waters an accurate survey such as the Company can do will be of much value. The party would be in a launch and would be accompanied by a Bahrain Government representative, probably a Police N.C.O. 8. I am afraid this letter appears to deal with a number of rather disconnected subjects, but they are all part of a single main subject and I thought it would be better to men tion them all in a single letter.

The fact that an island lies nearer to one country than to another has in itself no bearing on the question of ownership if there are other factors on which a judgment can be based; but as there seems to be a direct conflict of opinion on a cuestion of fact, we feel that before we pursue the matter with the Saudi Government, or even make up our minds on the best policy to pursue, we should satisfy ourselves as to the enact positions of these islands. 4.

In this connection political Agent, Bahrain, continues: •Meanwhile the Bahrain Petroleum Company are anxious to go ahead at once with triangulating the Additional Area, prior to the conclusion of the new Lease* It so happens that they have an expert survey party available very shortly (the party that was on the Saudi Arabia - Iraq boundary survey) and /anl if they’ can get on to this work at once it will save aueh time in subsequent geological and geophysical work in the area. The Bahrain Government are perfectly pre pared to allow them to do so, and since it is mapping work only I see no reason why we should object to the general plan. It involves only erecting concrete platforms as bases for instruments on certain of the is&amp;anis arxi reefs where the Bahrain Government marks al ready exist, together with •targets' on others. I have made it dear that the party must not on any account land on Bain as Saghir or Bain al Kabir - or even at Eawar for the time being; but otherwise I see no harm in their working on this triangulation inside the area enclosed in the lines marked on the Bahrain Government's rough sketch attached to your Express Letter No.C/33i dated the 7th May to the mdia Office. This work in fact might be extremely useful to us, for inevitably the Bahrain Petroleum Company will ask for a definition of the boundaries of the unallotted t tt TTranrr g ty y YYTxrxtxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx T rrrTTTTTTir r g g rTxrrxrxxxmxxrxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx The party would be in a launch and would be accompanied by a Bahrain Government representative, probably a Police N.C.O. I concur with the Political Agent that there is no harm in this work being oarr a great deal to be said for following up the suggestion made by Yusuf Yasin (paragraph 3 of Jedda despatch No.40, dated 2nd March 1939, to the Foreign Office) for •drawing a line midway between Bahrain and the mainland•« This line could Area on the eastern side of Bahrain. 5. The Political Agent then be produced indefinitely to the North. I concur.4. ■n^.v 6 . Jiy conaasnts on Yusuf Tasin f 8 suggestion are as follows: (a) If this line were drawn due North and South niidwajr hot ween Budaiya (the point nearest the Saudi mainland) on Manama Island and the Saudi mainland then it appears to me that Lihaina al Saghir would fall to the Saudis and Lihaina al Xhahir to Bahrain* (h) But Bahrain internationally includes all the territory under the Bahrain Government in which case the due North and South line should he drawn midway between Uma Na 9 san 9 which hy common consent belongs to Bahrain, and the Saudi mainland* In this case it appears to me that both islands would definitely fall to Bahrain. (o) I imagine, however, that the Saudi line if ever drawn would not he due North and South hut would he equidistant from both territories following the configuration of the coast line* In this case (1) if the line is equidistant between the Saudi mainland and the Island of Manama both Lihaina al Saghir and Lihaina al JChabir would appar ently fall to Saudi Arabia. (2) If the line is equidistant between the Saudi mainland and Uaa Nassau Lihaina al Aaghir would apparently fall to Bahrain and Lihaina al Khabir probably to Saudi \rabia.7. • rT ». “j sffP I surest that the Saudi Government ol^ht ^0 ^Giced to explain in detail what Is their idea ojf how the dividing line should run* 3d. r.o.vonx Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. .ttested for joretary to the ]*olitical .n tt /Resident in the Persian CrUlf.eammmmmmmm Confidential D.O.

I should have mentioned in that letter that the Oil Company*a map 'Chart 7 Persian Gulf * Arabia to Bahrain Island' is a little misleading in one respect in that it appears to indicate that Bird Island and Bain al Kabir are two separate islands. In point of fact they are one and the 8ame 9 and the position of the island is that shown as Bird Island. I send you herewith a revised map which makes this clearer. 3. I went out myself in His Highness* launch on i^riday last to verify this and had a most interesting cruise in the waters north of Bain al Kabir f eastwards to the Fasht al Jarim and south from there to Khor Fasht. According to observations which I took, naturally in a very amateur manner, Bain al Kabir and Bain as 3aghir are almost exactly north and south on a magnetic bearing. The waters north of Bain al Kabir are full of shoals, and it is no means easy to find channels through them. But, except for the reef running more or less north-west of Bain al Kabir which dries out In patches, these reefs appear to be permanently submerged until one strikes Chachus to the west or Jaria to the east. 4 . I am left in no doubt whatsoever that, as I said befors, the Bainain are outside the territorial waters both of Saudi Arabia and of Bahrain. And I am more than ever convinced that we A The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C•!.£•, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.we should do our best to try to run a line more or less north and south through these two Islands y projecting the line inde finitely towards the north. In order to divide Saudi and Bahrain ,f epheres ,, . Unless we do this, whichever country establishes its claim to either of the Islands presumably acquires three miles of territorial waters with it, and this would make things very {'Jo complicated for everyone. £» I am forwarding to you separately a sketch map which has been prepared by the Bahrain Petroleum Company from Admiralty charts and other information on record, showing Bahrain, the Saudi and Qatar coasts and much of the waters to the north. This sketch map is at present very incomplete and, in some respects (particularly towards the east) it can make no claim to accuracy* I have marked on this sketch map my proposed line between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain which I suggest should form the basis of a discussion for the purpose of dividing interests in submerged lands. Presumably one cannot mark off an inter national boundary, which would be recognised by other Powers, in waters which cannot be claimed as territorial by either party; but if the two parties could agree that Bain as Saghir should be regarded as Bahrain property and Bain al Kabir as 3audl, without conferring any rights to territorial waters to the west and east of these islands respectively, and if they could agree between themselves that Bahrain would claim no interests to the west of the north-south line and Saudi Arabia no interests to the east of it, then a workable agreement should be possible. Prom the practical point of view, other Powers and other interests are unlikely to intervene. 6 . A certain amount of speed is X think necessary. I gather that the California Arabian Company have already been talking to Ibn Saud about exploration in shoal waters; and that one result has been that Saudi Arabia has been putting up flags on various exposed /•exposed reefs and small Islands off the Hasa Coast more to the north. We may find Saudi Arabia making rather extravagant claims in regard to territorial waters y though presumably these would not worry us to any great extent except in so far as they may affect Bahrain interests. Consequently it is most desirable to arrange a 'gentleman's agreement' 1 between Arabia and Bahrain before the Saudis start stretching their arms too wide. Yours sincerely. Since writing the above I have received a copy of your Express letter No. C/223 dated the 26th May 1939, in which you suggest that the Saudi Govern ment be asked to explain in detail their idea of how the dividing line should run. I am however etlll submitting my idea about the line and sending a sketch map showing how it goes, since the Saudis will probably claim more than their Just share and yon may think /! ^ it desirable that the Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned should be invited to consider in advance the alternative proposals which we shall almost certainly have to make.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN LAND DEPA RT 81 ENT H* B.

You will see that Bain as Saghir is now admitted by Fowle to Ik-outside the territorial waters of Umm Na’san The two disputed islands appear on the enclosed chart ?s El Ben es Seguira” and ”E1 Bena Cabera”. This chart appears to have been prepared by the two associated Companies of the Standard Oil Company, and as the Saudi claims are based on information supplied by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (paragraph 4 of Jedda despatch No.40 of the 2nd March) Y/e may perhaps take it that both parties to the disoute accept the location of the islands as marked on this chart. Possibly the Admiralty have material which would Enable them to check it. H.L. Baggallay, Esq., ^ • h&lt;^/ Foreign Office, S.W.l.2 . The chart docs not, however, hear out Yusuf Yasirn’s contention that Bain al Khabir is nearer to the mainland than to Bahrein; if propinquity is to he taken as a criterion both islands seem to lie closer to Bahrein territory (including therein the island of Umm Na’san) than to the mainland. The Bahrein claim is moreover strengthened by the prior assertion of ownership in the setting up of marks, and there appears (paragraph 2 of Powle’s letter) to be evidence of the exercise of sovereignty by Bahrein in 1909. These facts would appear to establish a prima facie presumption that Bahrein’s claims to both these islands are superior to those of the Saudis. 3. We should however be glad to have your views and those of the Admiralty on Powle’s letter generally and in particular on his suggestion that the solution of drawing a line midway between Bahrein and the mainland might be pursued. It would be useful, before anything further is said to the Saudis, to know which of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 6 of his letter would command most support in international practice. 4.

Your letter to Eyres No. P.Z.4125/39 dated July 8th, concerning the ovmership of the disputed islands lying hetv/een territory of the Sheilch of Bahrein and the mainland of Saudi Arabia. 2. Although there appears to be little doubt that the Sheikh of Bahrein has a far better claim to these islands on prescriptive grounds, and that such a claim would take precedence over the Saudi claim on the basis of geographical propinquity, v/e agree with the Foreign Office that it is highly desirable that Saudi Arabia and Bahrein should reach some such agreement as that suggested in the Political,. A v~-{- l Ji 'l ^ + 4-^OQ 4-V-i Ti.T Tr +V'ir&gt; 1 ) allocation of the islands to either of these claimants \ not settle the wider problem of the division of the sea bed between Bahrein and Hasa for the purposes of winning oil. 3. We fed, therefore, that it would be best to take up the suggestion already made by the Saudi Authorities, that the whole area should be divided up between them and Bahrein by an agreed lino. Whether or not we make the first proposal or persuade them to do so is a matter of tactics but the Political Agent’s proposed line appears to us likely to prove satisfactory as a working arrangement if it v/ere acceptable to both sides. 4. The Foreign Office would seem to be strictly correct in saying that there is no recognised principle on v/hich such a line should be based, since for the most part, it would traverse the high seas. With regard to Straits less than 6 miles wide however, His Majesty’s Government in reply to the League Questionnaire of 1930, expressed the view that when the two shores belonged to different States, the division between the two belts of territorial waters would lie 'midway between the two shores'’. This phrase was not further defined, but the only common sense interpretation would be that the dividing line should plot the points equidistant from both shores. 5. It accordingly seems desirable to consider the equity of the Political Agent’s proposed line as compared with a line equidistant from Bahrein and Saudi territory. On the assumption that the Sheikh of Bahrein could make good his claim to both islands, the Political Agent’s line would deprive him of a strip some2 sea miles wide and 12 miles long in the waters lying between the islands and the mainland; on the other hand Saudi Arabia would lose heavily further North since a line equidistant from both States would turn R. T.Peel, Esq. ,GBji. , MO. , India Office, sharply/sharply to the East from roughly tho Northern limit of territorial v/aters of Bird Island* Bahrein would therefore he doing reasonably well if the Political Agent’s line were obtained, but a line which favoured Saudi Arabia to any considerably greater extent would be inequitable to Bahrein. As a matter of tactics, therefore, it would seem bettor to open negotiations either by suggesting a line more favourable to bahrein than the Political Agent’s line or persuading Ibn Saud to mahe the first proposal* In view of Sheikh Yasuf Yasin’s approach we agree with Eyres that the latter seems the wiser course. 6* There may, however, be certain difficulties in defining the purposes for which any line approximating to the Political Agent’s proposed division is adopted. If it could re a jxo nably bo maintained that the islands do not fulfil the qualification necessary in the British view of being capable of effective occupation and use, no serious difficulties would arise, and any agreement need merely record that both parties were of opinion that the islands were not susceptible of formal annexation and that Saudi Arabia would not grant any concessions covering tho sea bed to the Eastward or Bahrein to the Westward of the dividing line. Whether in fact the islands arc capable of effective use and occupation seems a matter of some doubt since their characteristics and even their exact dimensions are not known. On the basis of the knowledge which we possess, we feel capable of saying that no European could effectively occupy either island, but it is possible that an Arab might live there, although food and water would have to be imported. This assertion is based on tho assumption that the dimensions of Bird Island are 400 yards by 200 yards and its height 2 feet, and those of El-bin-es-Sequira 500 yards by 350 yards with a height of 3 feet. If the islands are smaller than this then strong winds would cause the sea to wash over them on the weather side and spray might render them untenable at certain times. 7. It would probably be reasonable therefore to treat the islands as being incapable of effective occupation and use* It this were not considered desirable or possible then there are the following possibilitiesi- (1) The lino could be drawn so as to leave the territorial waters of each island within the sphere of the State to which it is allotted. (2) The line could be drawn arbitrarily and the tv/o States would have to agree that neither regarded the islands as part of his territory in which case it would theoretically be possible for a third State to step in and establish a claim to them. This risk would probably be negligible in practice. ( 3 ) The line could be drawn allocating each island definitely to one or another of the two parties, each renouncing.in favour of the other that part of the territorial waters (and the underlying sea bed) of his island (or islands) which lay within the sphere allotted to the other party. . The legal anomalies created by this last arrangement, although/ 8although not in practico likely to cause much trouble scorn so involved that it would he preferable to avoid this solution if possible. On the other hand the first solution while being the obvious arrangement from the theoretical point of view might be difficult to negotiate since it adds so materially to the advantage of establishing a claim to one orboth of the islands. 9. The second solution has the advantage of avoiding most of the practical difficulties and leaving a simple dividing line, but it would make it virtually impossible for Bahrein to levy any more taxes on the non-Bahreini fishing vessels using either island. 10. You may however decide that this is a consideration of no account. If you do, we would suggest that the second solution appears, subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein, the best to aim at unless you are prepared to treat the islands as being incapable of effective occupation and use* 11.

My dear Gibson, I enclose ar copy of a telegram from Bullard at Jedda regarding the status of three more islands or reefs lying between Bahrein and the mainland. This emphasises the desirability of reaching an early agreement regarding a line to define Bahreini and Saudi spheres of influence, such as has been suggested in the correspondence ending with Jarrett’s letter to Peel of the 8th November (M 07938/3^/. ^ ^ 2. We share Bullard’s view that a preliminary discussion between Weightman and a representative of Ibn Saud would be useful as a first step, and if you agree, we v/ill authorise Bullard to suggest this to the Saudi Arabian Government. At the same time we would instruct Bullard to inform the Saudi Arabian Government that we were inclined to consider favourably their sugges tion of drav/ing a line midway between Bahrein and the mainland in order to avoid future disputes, and to enquire how they would propose that this line should run, in order that we might ascertain the views of the Sheikh of Bahrein. 3. A telegram to Bullard on some such lines is relatively urgent. When it has gone we should like to consider further, in the light of Jarrett’s letter, the questions of international law etc. involved in the proposed division of territory. Meanwhile it looks to us as if Fasht al Jarim and Khor-al-Fasht were (as Bullard suggests) unquestionably a part of the Bahrein formation and Gezira Chaschus equally a part, geographically speaking, of Saudi Arabia.

We are inclined to doubt whether either Ruler would welcome the solution favoured by the Admiralty involving a common renunciation of a claim to sovereignty over the two small islands or would appreciate the reasons for which it is advanced. Of the possibilities mentioned in paragraph 7 of Jarrett’s letter one would expect them to prefer either (3) - the Political Agent’s suggestion - or (1) to (2). And it is of course not yet clear that the Sheikh, who has in the past claimed sovereignty over both islands, will acquiesce willingly in renouncing his claim to one of them, as contemplated in Weightman’s proposal. 4.
