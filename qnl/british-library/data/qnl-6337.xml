British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, tfy August 1920. / ^ To The Political Agent, Koweit. Memorandum ^ The export of arms to the Persian and Arab (Truoial) from Koweit seems to be increasing again* The Intelligence Officer has received intimation of several consignments and I am glad to say the Customs, on our report, were able to catch one dhow ' with arms* The dhow will be confiscated under the Customs Heglement, and I think that probably the Persian arms runners will try and bring the arms across in Koweit dhows. So T think it might be as well to tell the Shaikh clearly that Article 3^ of the Reglement douanier provides that when the importation of prohibited articles is detected not only are the articles liable to confiscation but also the means of transport • in these oases the dhow -, the importers too are of course liable /-v to imprisonment and fine* Further, as the Shaikh has been warned several times, and everyone in Koweit is aware that the arms traffic is illegal, if any Koweit dhow is caught landing arms I do not propose to take any action to prevent its con fiscation or the imprisonment or fine of its nakhuda and crew* % The last information received by the Intelligence Officer was that several dhows with arms on board were leaving shortly for Debai - doubtless they will have left before this reaches you. I should be glad to know whether you oan do anything at the Koweit end to check this smuggling. I am of course aware that the Shaikh is obstructive about the matter; but in spite of this it may be possible to devise something* For instance alli all these Persian dhows are now numbered: if the Director of Customs had reasonable proof that a particular Tan^istani dhow had taken a consipnnient of arms he could arrange to have it detained the next time it visited Bushire or Lingah. Your files have probably shown you the modus operand! of the Tangistani smugglers Certain Khans collect a good sum of money - several thousand krans.and then send one or generally two (no doubt to watch each other) men to Koweit, who stay there and gradually buy up arms and ammunition: generally they are there for several weeks, and then when they have got enough they ship them off for Dilwar or some other small port by dhow. If it were possible for any spy to ascertain time of departure and destination or even approximate destination of the dhow or nr before the actual day of sailing, and the information be wired priority here we, or the Customs^could very often arrange to intercept the dhows; if the fcfe agent could give the number of the dhow so much the better, but this is probably toe much to expect. I attach a list of men who are known to have visited Foweit very frequently to purchase arms and ammunition. Ha51 Yusuf Kazeruni used to be the great arms broker and seller for the Tangistanis; I don’t know whether he still is, he left Bushire for Kerbela after some months detention here, voider a cloud,**/^/y and I don’t know whether he has resumed his business or not. eut-C©l.

Prior to 1909 or 1910 or thereabouts a lot of arms and ammunition were surreptitiously carried on B.I.Stearners but the trafiic was stopped, such traffic being naturally easier to deal with than that by boat, The fact that it seems to have revived at Koweit inclines me to Accept your view of the reason, rather than the Shaikh^s. I have not the slightest doubt in my ow.n mind that Abdul Latif takes bribes to allow arms etc. to pass, and I strongly suspect that a portion of what he takes goes on to the Shaikh. But? it is difficult to prove these things. But we know this is what happened at Muscat in the palmy days of J:he Arms Traffic there, and by all oriental standards, and some others, the Shaikh and his Chief Customs Official would be fools not to make hay while the sun shines. I trust £ou will bontijiue to worry the Shaikh about the Afcms Traffic; you might remind him that he often asks for our assistance, and we naturally expect him to reciprocate, and that it is, unlikely that the British Government would spend thousands of pounds in suppressing the Arms Traffic from Muscat only to allow it to spring up at Koweit, so that if he allows it to get too big,the probabilities are that he may one day findfind the British Governnent taking active steps to stop it, which would inconvenience him a good deal.rvs } Telegram X.

I have the honour to submit herewith a report on the Arms Traffic situa tion m the Persian Gulf. TJEE ARMS TRAFFIC IN THE PERSIAN GULF. September 1920. The present situation of the Arms Traffic in the Gulf, though in no way commensurable with what took place before the war, is far from having com pletely died down. The essential difference between that time and now, is that whereas formerly the entire supply of arms was shipped direct from Europe to Muscat in enormous quantities to be smuggled across to Baluchistan, the present source is wholly Arabia and Mesopotamia. The chief place in the Gulf whence there is a small but steady stream of arms into Persia, is Koweit, where considerable quantities of 303 Service rifles and ammunition have been accumulated. These have been collected from the former battlefields of Mesopotamia, from friendly tribes of that country to whom large issues of arms were made by the Government during the war, and from the tribes of the King of the Hedjaz, who were well supplied^with Service rifles for use against the Turks and are now selling off their surplus stock. A good many rifles were also captured from these tribes of the King of the Hedjaz by Ibn Saud’s men in the fighting which took place between them, and are now finding their way through to Koweit and other, small towns on the Arabian side of the Gulf. These arms are exported from Koweit in two directions. By far the larger number are smuggled across in dhows to the Persian coast between Bandar Dilam and about 40 miles south of Lingah. The other direction, but in considerably smaller numbers, is chiefly overland to Gatr and Dubai whence, as opportunity offers, arms are sent across in dhows which trade principally between Minab and Chahbar on the Mekran coast. It is, therefore, convenient for the purposes of this report to divide the extent of the Persian coast under consideration into the two parts mentioned above, it being, of course, understood that no hard and fast dividing line can be made. To obtain information as to anything like the actual numbers of rifles landed in these two districts is, of course, extremely difficult, if not practically impossible without unreasonable expense. In the first section of coast from reports received, which have been carefully investigated and where possible confirmed, it can be safely stated that during the past nine months of this year at least 600-800 rifles were landed at various times from Koweit and neighbourhood. Ninety-five per cent, of these rifles were modern pattern 303 Service weapons, the remainder being of various types chiefly Turkish Mausers. There is little demand for the latter type owing to the small amount of ammunition available for them. Each rifle is almost invariably accompanied by at least 100 cartridges. Besides this, large consignments of ammunition are carried over separately, and though even more than in the case of rifles is the actual number difficult to ascertain, it can scarcely have been less than 100,000 rounds. Practically the whole of this quantity of arms is absorbed in the province of Ears, where in addition to the local inhabitants the presence of the large Qashgai and Arab nomad tribes provides a never ceasing demand. Towards the south of the first section of'coast, i.e., south of Lingah, rifles are occasionally carried overland in caravans to Bandar Abtyas whence they are taken on to Biyaban and Mekran.2 The proof of the abundance of Service rifles now present in lars is the current price, which near the coast between Bandar Dilam and Lin gab is about 40-45 tumans (130-140 rupees at the present rate) for a Service rifle and 40-50 rounds of ammunition. Ammunition itself is fairly plenlilul at the price of about 12 tumans (40 rupees) per 100 rounds. There are few villages along this strip of coast in which there is not at least one rifle in each family. As regards Persian Baluchistan between the limits already mentioned, i.e.) Minab along the Biyaban and Mekran coasts to Chahbar, the number of rifles landed, though smaller, is less easy to estimate accurately owing to the nature of the country, the scarcity of the population, and the consequent difficulty in obtaining reliable information. From reports received the number can at least bo put down as 200-300 rifles with some 15-20,000 cartridges, though the latter is probably a good deal less than the actual figures. The price prevalent in these parts is 200 250 rupees for a Service rifle and 50 rounds. The price of ammunition is generally given as about 60 rupees per 100. (The currency here is nearly all rupees.) A good proportion of these arms are generally believed to make their way to Persian Baluchistan, Kirman, and Sistan, and through the latter province especially they no doubt ultimately arrive in Afghanistan. As regards parties of Afghans who formerly used to arrive in large caravans in the Mekran for the purpose of buying arms, no reports have been received for a long time of the presence of any such bodies. Occasionally an odd Afghan or two is reported to have arrived in the district for this purpose, but at the present time arms are not being imported here in sufficient numbers to make it worth while for large parties to undertake the long and dangerous journey. . In considering the question of how best to put an end to this arms traffic into Persia the most obvious and easy method naturally would be to stop the stream at its source, i.e., at Koweit. In this town not only is the Sheikh conversant with what is, going on, but there is little doubt that he receives a percentage on all weapons exported from his town. The names of the chief merchants engaged in this trade are known to have been reported to the Political authorities. Actual proof of these men’s guilt, however, is almost impossible to obtain, since these transactions are naturally conducted with the greatest secrecy. The only useful method would be to have weapons bought by one of cur agents from these merchants in the presence of witnesses. It is not considered, however, by the Political authorities in the light of past experi ence that this plan ^wbich would be very costly to carry out) would in practice be feasible or lead to definite results. It is most doubtful if any men could be found who would be willing to testify to what they had seen when brought before the Sheikh and the arrested merchants, through fear of the subsequent reprisals they know would certainly follow. Even should it be possible to effect the proof of these dealers’ guilt it would only mean the imposition of a nominal fine by the Sheikh and their early release should their imprisonment be insisted upon. Further, in view of the situation in Arabia just now”, the Political authorities do not consider it advisable to put undue pressure upon the Sheikh and force him to put an absolute stop to this trade, which he has the power to do, unless it assumes very much larger proportions. The point to emphasise about Koweit is, that even supposing the arms traffic from this port could be effectively stopped, it merely means that it would break out again almost immediately from some spot a little further down on the Arab coast. It remains therefore to consider what other steps can be taken to prevent arms being landed in Persia. The Persian officials can at once be dismissed from, the case, as even if they really did wish to put down this traffic (which is very doubtful) they have no means at their disposal to enforce their authority. The Governor of the Gulf Ports (until a few days ago the Darya Begi) has no forces except one antiquated vessel, the “ I^ersepolis,” whose deep draught and slow speed render her quite unsuitable for the work of chasing dhows and entering in close to small ports. The Mudirs, or CuAom officials, in charge in the small ports where all this gun-running takes place, are themselves, for the most part, hand and glove with the dhow owners and gun-runners, and where they are not, areabsolutely helpless. Arms are at present often landed in the very presence of the Custom officials who dare not interfere. The Director of Customs has an armed launch and a small steamer with which dhows are occasionally searched, but they are generally busy moving from port to port carrying officials, etc,, and cannot be put exclusively on to this work. What is a good deal more im portant is that all the crews of these Custom boats are Persians and as such are far from being trustworthy in the matter of apprehending these dhows, or of being above taking bribes to let them through. Hitherto my efforts have been ‘ necessarily confined to sending Secret Service agents over to Koweit who send information by means of code tele grams, of any dhows they can get news of, about to carry rifles over to the Persian coast. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining reliable and suitable men this method has hitherto been attended with very little success. The average agent generally turns out to have been dealing with both sides to his own great advantage and usually returns with some absurd story as the reason for not having been able to accomplish anything. I had hoped to make a systematic attempt to stop some of this traffic in co-operation with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, Captain Pearson, B.N., who showed himself ready to give every assistance in his power and was anxious to help. Since the latter end of July, however, owing to the troubles in Mesopotamia both of His Majesty’s ships in the Gulf, i.e., H. M. S. “ Triad ” and H. M!. S. “^spiegle have been stationed at Basrah with the majority of their crews on patrol work up the river. The plan I had arranged to work on with the Senior Naval Officer consequently fell to the ground. As a matter of fact neither of the above mentioned warships are very suitable for chasing dhows and doing patrol work generally, owing to their slow speed (about 8-10 knots, much slower than a big dhow’ with a favourable wind) and also on account of their deep draught, especially in the case of H. M. S. ‘ Triad,” which prevents them lying close in to the shore in creeks and getting in near to the small ports. In addition the ration of coal at present allowed to these two ships is so small that they are immobilised for the gieater part of the month. At the present moment when news arrives of the departure of a dhow with arms from the Arabian coast, I am entirely dependent upon being able to persuade the Belgian Director of Customs to send out one of his boats after it. This*is altogether unsatisfactory, as, apart from his own two vessels, already mentioned, being frequently absent just wffien wanted most, the Director himself does not al ways care to send a boat to investigate^ a report unless he is convinced of the absolute certainty of a capture being made, owing to his small allowance of coal and nil, etc. When all is said and done this reliance upon agent’s telegrams in inter cepting gun-runners is at best a haphazard method and largely dependent upon good luck on the part of the agent who cannot hope to discover the move ments of more than a small proportion of those dhows who carry arms across. If the General Staff consider that the arms situation as described above warrants every effort being made to stop it I am of the opinion that the only satisfactory method is for a small, fairly fast, steam or petrol driven vessel to be allotted for this purpose and placed at my disposal. There are good grounds for believing that with such a vessel we should be successful in effecting captures of rifles and ammunition ; and even if sensational results were not obtained that a very considerable check could be imposed on this gun-running, and, at least, a great increase in the price of arms landed in Persia proper and Persian Baluchistan be brought about. Should the General Staff decide that the arms traffic question be under taken in this way, I request that arrangements be made with the Naval Com- mander-in-Chief, East Indies, for a suitable boat to be placed at my disposal. In the event of any difficulty in arising in finding a boat which could be snared for this work, there is at present in the Gulf, though badly in need of an overhaul, a very suitable vessel, namely, the “ Karanja lent to the Military authorities by the Eoyal Indian Marine, and at present employed under the Offi cer Commanding Troops, Ba- dar Abbas. The Officer^Commandmg Troops,4 Gulf Ports, has signified his willingness to give up the tC Karanja ” on the condition that a boat be placed at the disposal of the Officer Commanding Troops, Bandar Abbas, in case of trouble arising with the Political prisoners from Mesopotamia now on Henjam Island. The Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, has recently sent a sea-going launch to the Vice-Consul, Bandar Abbas, and has stated his readiness to fulfil the above requirements of the Officer Commanding Troops, Gulf Ports. further particulars necessary such as armament, etc., which would be required, could at once be supplied. In conclusion it should be stated that, the war being over, the stock of arms available fo” running across to Persia is, of course, limited and cannot ^ be drawn upon ifidefinfiely. At the same time to judge from all reports, there * does not seem much doubt that the total amount will not fye exhausted for at least a year or two yet. Should it be decided to allot a boat to me especially for this work, any Bushire ; The 30th September 1920. It. T. WATTS, Captain, Intelligence Officer, Fersian Gulf.

He rolled up here Just after I had left on tour for the south of the Gulf at the end of Uarch and has been here ever since waiting,so he says,for my return. I am not sure whether T told you all about this man before but the facts are these which I had better give you in full as I would very much like to obtain your help in his case if you can see your way to do it. This man,Yusuf Kazerunl by name,has been supplying me with information on gun-running for the past year and he was the agent from whoa we obtained the news which led to our solit ary capture of a dhow at sea in June of last year.Since then he has sent four telegrams giving information about dhows leaving Koweit with arms. Three of these I subsequently as certained were perfectly correct,and it was only owing to the fact that no warships were available at the time that we were unable to intercept them. This man also claims to fcax have done very useful work in Koweit by acting as agent for Persians who come over to buy arms and then informing the Customs officials who come down and seize them. According to Yusuf he brings this about by informing those Customs offic ials to whom the gun-runners have not given a bribe. He has given me a number of instances in which he declares arms and ammunition have been seized in this way, but of course I am arable to confirm them. However there is no doubt that he has, on the whole, done extraordinary good work,being an old fun- runner himself,and he has been of the greatest assistance to me in putting,what I think may be called,a decided check on the business as far as the northern part of the Gulf is(sv&gt; K'D Ct j y f Concerned.He Has of couree been well rewarded for hie work but has always declared that the only reason he ever consented to „urn against his own associates was In the hopes of obtain ing our assistance to recover the sum of R. 30,000 which a cer tain Arab merchant of Kowelt,named Ishak Hajlrl.dld him out of about two years ago.This money Yusuf had brought over to buy arms with,and had handed It over for this purpose to this Arab w ' :0 16 an a 8ent In the business. For the last eight monthsax or so have been bluffing him by promises of assistance In recov ering his money and have succeeded In putting him off until n0w ^ saying that *hen he had really done some good work I would certainly try and help him In the matter.Unfortunately he now takes up the attitude that a year's service Is quite sufficient good work for me to do something for him In return, and T am afraid that unless be can be bluffed In a different way he win refuse to work any more in the arms traffic! have explained to him before that the most he could hope for was a ecommendation to the Sheikh that his case should be Inquired lnt0 and Ju6tlc ® b ® done. He says that this will satisfy him perfectly and that he^such good proofs of the money having baa been taken frma^fraudently that such a recommendation would be quite sufficient* 1 Was wonde rlng therefore whether It would be possible for you, quite Informally,by a note,or verbally.whichever would be more convenient,to tell the Sheikh that you had received a letter from the Resident at Bushlre to say that he had been requested — a Sreat faYOur by th e Persian governor to endeavour to have this man's case inquired Into by representing the matter through the British Political Agent at Kowelt .In no sense would It mean to be Implied, of course, that the British authorities were taking up a Persian’s case but that a mere request was being made for an Investigation by the Sheikh in the matter to oblige the Governor of Bushlre since the latter has no representative m Kowelt.The fact that this man Yusuf has now been absent from Koweit for nearly three months would,I think,lend colour(3) pu*&lt;. **• colour to &amp; atory that he had spent this time wandering around before all the Persian officials he could get at and finally Managed to persuade the Governor to make' a special request to the Resident. If you see no objection to doing this I feel sure that it would be an eacellent thing;as whether the man gets his money back or not is of course a matter of indifference;but if he saw that something had been done for him he*would,I think,be willing to go on doing useful work in the future for at least some months to come in the hopes of accomplishing his object. I have of course explained the whole matter to Colonel Trevor who considers, that if you see no objection to doing what I suggest it would be a good thing for the sake of keeping in with this man .The idea,to repeat,is for you to make jask a more or less casual andattnformal request to the Sheikh to see whether the man has a just grievance or not. I have shown this letter to Colonel Trevor who approves of it. This Yusuf leaves for Kowelt by the same boat as this letter goes by. I have told him to come and see you some 4-5 days after his arrival. For purposes of Identification I have given him a page out of the BkJbc British Army list (No 1440, the Highland Light Infantry) to show you. I did not answer your first letter to me as I was hoping in reply th send the photos along*I am exceedingly sorry now to have to say that the prints are a failure.It is particularly annoying since,if you remember,I sent specially to Bombay for fresh paper and the stuff they have sent is stale. I took the greatest care in developing but there is no doubt what is the matter. This time,however,to make quite sure I will send the negatives themselves to Kodak at Bombay with instructions to forward you direct two copies of each. I am very sorry indeed for the delay that has occurred. I w« B delighted to hear froa Colonel Trevor that you had tel egraphed that Ismail Khan Plruzkuhl had turned up at Kowelt and wanted work. I as/.ed the Colonel to wire you In reply to request(4). request you to send him along by the first ship*I hear however from the B*I»agents here that no slow mall Is expected In from Basra for another twelve 4iys or so,consequently Isma’il Khan will not be able to reach here until! then #That ship I must catch to get down to Bundar Abbas sogwlll $ou please tell not to get off at Bushire but to stay on board cojje with me down there. 1 specially want him to do a Job of work foijgin that place. I will of course fix up about his pas sage. Will you please tell me if you nave incurred any ex penses on his behalf since he arrived at Kowelt and let me know the amoun) when I will send it to you. I got Colonel Trevor to wire to Peel about the Arab agent he spoke about but had a reply to say he had got another Job. - &amp;uj s&gt;dr r y he could not come as he seemed a good man»but now that Isoa'U Khan has turned up It does not natter so much.

(b) For the trade on the Makran Coast Rifles 200 Ammunition 50,000 to 40,000 rounds Similarly the Director, Persian Gulf Section I. E. T.

Considerable stocks of these are known to exist in Arabia. These supplies are being periodi cally augmented by caravans from Syria, bound for Hail and Najd, which are the main depots._ w / Reports which we have as yet been unable to verify, allege Italian activity in the Red Sea. In this case such arms would^presumably In the first instance shipped to Eritrea and subsequently carried across to the Arabian Coast. Arms and Ammunition reach the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf by two main routes Routes. ) ) (a) via Hail to lowolt (b) via Hajd to Qatar and the Truolal Coast Ports. Of these the former is the more important, as Bln Sa'ud, Amir of Najd, endeavours to hold up as magy arms as possible for his own use. The markets about which we are concerned are:** ———• (1) Mesopotamia Markets.) ) (a) South Persia (3) Persian Baluchistan (4) Afghanistan (5) British Makran Mesopotamia is supplied generally from Hall direct. The Persian Coast from the Shattel Arab to the neighbourhood of Llngah is supplied from Kowelt, which is at present the principal export port connected with the Arms Traffic. The remaining three markets of Persian Baluchistan, Afghanistan and British Makran are supplied from the ports of Qatar and Trucial Coast. Muscat has altogether fallen out of the trade. The chief markets areundoubtedly Southern Persia and Mesopotamia. There is a continuous though small filtration of arms into Persian Baluchistan, but there Is no evidence at present of any traffic with Afghanistan. This in all probability is due to the fact that Afghanistan is now able to obtain all the arms and ammunition it requires from the north. This should tend to reduce the Arms Traffic on the Makran Coast as the demand le now confine d to Persian Baluchistan proper, of/-N / which the main depot i» Bampur, and the individual ^ requirements of British l£akr&amp;n. On the other hand it is to he remembered that the Afghan prefers the •3C3 rifle and that he knows that with the withdrawal of the Eastern Persian Cordon and our reductions in the Sarhad, that he can again with impunity take his caravans through to Afghanistan along the old route between the Sarhad and lenaan and across the narrow strip of country between Eehanibagh « and Hobat. 7 There is one marked difference in the conditions of the Arms traffic of the x&gt;resent day as compared with those of former years, namely that whereas in former years whole dhow-loads of arms and ammunition were shipped, in these days a dhow does not carry more than a few rifles and small consignments of ammunition which are concealed in the general cargo. This applies to the whole area. tfe consider that, despite’ the fact that the figures -—before us show no immediate marked Conclusion.- ) y increase in the traffic, traders are watching their opportunity, and the large collection of arms now in Arabia is a source of future potential danger. This danger d will undoubtedly materialise if the reports of Italian activity are correct. The fact that there has not been any material — increase in the Arms Traffic is, in Recommendations.) 0U r opinion, due to the activity of His Majesty's ships, which are closely watching the traffic ar^L periodically searching dhows ^ With the knowledge of large supplies at hand and possible Italian enterprise in this direction, we advocate the following measures (a) The maintenance of the existing Naval force in the Persian Gulf, supplemented by permission to ss^ab iak immediately a motor boat coastal patrol in the•vent of an Increase of the traffic taking place. (b) A wireless installation at koweit for direct communication with His Majesty*s ships working in the Gulf* (c) Pressure on Sheikhs and in the case of Kovelt an effort to persuade the Sheikh to establish registration of arms. can be anticipated from this recommendation, as even with the beat intentions the Sheikhs are frequently unable to prevent their subjects from carrying on the trade.

I have pointed out to the Shaikh that, as Ibrahim bfet Madhaf had no paper of any sort authorising him to carry ths arms, the action of the Persian Customs was only what could be acted, and that the same thing would doubtless have happened had his boat been searched by one of his Majesty's ships. Ibrahim bin Madhaf, whom I know well personally, is an influential merchant of Kuwait, and I think his story Is true and that the, arms were not intended for sale. The small propor tion of ammunition to rifles in itself Indicates that. Under the circumstances, I think that, if you could assist the Shaikh in the matter, it might make him more amenable to introduce the reforms we want for the prevention of the Anas , Traffie. i at the same time I think you win agree that it is a&lt; undesirable that people should be allowed to wander about the i with anna for which they have no sort of licence, and that, in any oaa. in whloh It la aonaid««^ onsidered naaasaary that a man /*.*** *(£) c carry arms in hia boat # ha should b# giTon &amp; epacial lioenca by »a on tha Shaikh's raoommendation, and I would suggest that I tell the Shaikh that in future no assistanee will be given to anyone not in possession of such a licence.

He says that, at his request, the Pirector of Customs at Bushire has-made full inquiries into the matter hut has informed him that it appears^ that Ibrahim al-Madhaf did not declare the arms on his arrival at Kharij as he naturally would have done had they 'been merely intended for defence, hut that he definitely told the Customs officials that he had nothing to declare and that he even went so far as to try and prevent them from going on hoard his boat. As the importation of arms into Persian territory is forbidden he rendered himself liable to the confiscation not only of the arms, but even of the boat itself. Prom the fact that he did not declare the arras, the director of Customs is of opinion that his real intention was to barter them for pearxs, and the fact that he left Kharij without buying any pearls ’ appears to him to bear out this view. The Political 'Resident asks rae to inform Your Excellenc that as Ibrahim al-Madhaf was not in possession of any pass for the arms in question, he regrets that he is unable to take the matter up with the Persian Government with a view to the return of the arms. He asks rne to advise Your Excel lency to again impress upon your subjects the importance of their taking out proper papers, without ^v/hich it is imposs- ible for him to give them the assistance which he would wish to do. In this connection I would draw your Excellency’s attention to my letter ITo.952, dated the 2nd Jamadi I 1359 U.E. to the late Shaikh SalimNo. 180-C Political Agency # Kuwait.. 24tk OctolDer 1921.

After compliments. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 5S4, dated the 27th l^uharram 1540 (30th # September 1921), in which you informed me that you had written to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, regarding the arms and ammuni tion confiscated from Ibrahim bin M&amp;dhaf by the Customs Authorities at Kharag; and that he had replied to you to the effect that the Provincial Director of Customs had had inquiries made and had informed him that it transpired from these that Ibrahim bin Lladhaf had not declared the arms to the Customs officials on his arrival at Kharag but had told them that he had nothing to declare and had tried to prevent them from going on board his boat; and that the Director of Customs was of opinion that his real intention was to barter them for pearls. Also that the Political Resi dent says that, as Ibrahim bin lladhaf had no papers, he is unable to make out a case for the return of the arms, and refers to his advice to me to warn my sub jects to take out the necessary papers, without which it is impossible to afford them assistance. In this latter connection you refer to your letter No. 952, dated the 2nd Jamad I 1339 v!2th January 1921) to my uncle the late Shaikh Salim, In reply I beg to point out that Ibrahim bin lladhaf states that when the Customs officials came to him he did not hinder them from boarding his boat, but they went on board and sat with him; when they asked him about the arms he said that he had arms for self protection, and when they demanded them he handec(yiA X them over without demur. He is a man of honour ^ho would not tell a lie. The idea that he wanted to barter them for pearls is absurd, and anyone who thinks must know that it is not true, as pearls require a huge sum of money to “buy. The truth is that he had taken the arms for protection; there can be no doubt about this, and I am convinced that it was th© case, as pearl dealers have never been in the habit of taking out the necessary papers for the arms which they take for protective purposes. 1 have looked up your letter Ko. 952 to my uncle the late Shaikh fcalim and I am nor T following the advice con tained therein, and have issued a fresh proclamation to my subjects warning thorn not to do anything contrary to the Customs regulations. Regarding the case of Ibrahim bin Uadhaf I shall be grateful if you will kindly inform the Political Resident of the true facts of the case, and ask him if he will be so kind as to assist me by trying to get the arms returned Usual ending.Ho . &amp; of 1921 .

I regret it is impossible for me to do anything further in the case, which I have carefully considered, as I hold that Ibrahim bin Hadhaf has in the circumstances got no claim of which there is the l^ist chance of success. Had his arms been confisca'ced in similar circumstances by one of H.Li. ohips I could not have pressed for their return and I therefore do not see my way to doing so when they are seized by the Customs. down in my memorandum po.1462,dated 12th September 1921 such situations would cease to exist.

' ) A copy of the report submitted by the Conference is enclosed with this despatch for your consideration. With the terms and recommendations of the report I am in general agreement. With special reference to the recommendation that a wireless set be installed at Kuwait I have the honour to report that the question was raised at the time of the tribal disturbances at Kuwait last October. A wireless set was supplied by the Military and was sent to Kuwaiit for erection as a precaution against possible destruction of the land line. I had not however sanctioned the purchase of the set,and owing to the cessation of hostilities at Kuwait,! proposed,with their consent,to return the set to the Military. On receipt however of representations from the Naval Commander-in-Chief that the installation of the wireless set at Kuwait was urgently necessary in connection with the suppression of gun running,! took up the( 2 ) the question with the Government of India who deferred a decision pending a settlement of the question as to the necessity for the continued employment of His Majesty*s ships on gun running operations. In view of the recotanen- dationa contained in the accompanying report I propose •that subject to the concurrence of His Majesty’e Government and the Government of India,the erection of the wireless $ aet,which is still at Kuwait,be tafcen in hand,and that the expenditure involved in the purchase,erect ion and maintenance of the set be shared by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government respectively. With reference to the recommendation that pressure be brought to bear on the Shaikh of Kuwait,! have the honour to refer you to the correspondence concluding with my telegram No.31 dated 19th April. I quite agree that steps should be taken to insist on the Shaik’s cooperation in the matter by the establishment of a system of registrar tion as at Muscat but before proceeding to take any action in this direction J would be glad of a ruling in the matter of my jurisdiction over Kuwait vis a vis that of the Government of India.

Shaikh Ahsaad al-Jahir aa-Subah, C.I.E #&gt; Ruler of Kuwait, After compliments, I be£ to draw your attention to our £oods which you have detained in Kuwait, I have written to you four times already asking you to release them, but without result, for what reason I do not know, as the question was decided during the lifetime of the late Shaikh Salim, I cannot think that these goods can make much difference to the wealth of the Ruler of Kuwait, and, although worth a hundred and six thousand rupees, I value them at no more than a gna^s wing, but the point is that your action is contrary to friendship and concord. The bonds of friendship between us have been strong from long ago up till the present time, but now you want to sever them and kindle the fire of enmity and hatred, I do not know what you are thinking of ^ in looking at me in anger. I do not believe there is anyone stronger or more powerful than I am in the whole of Pars, and I am surprised that you should treat me as if I were nobody. Things are not as you think, however; I am too bold and zealous to leave my property as the play-thing of foreign and foolish enemies. On previous occasions when hav ? asked you to release the goods, you have replied like a summer shower - as the poet says ”1 was begml^d hy the summer showerand you evidently thought us laZ/ £7icl stupid.

(1) Suq District. i'he situation in the buq district the is at/present moment causing a certain amount of uneasiness. Almost every man appears to he armed with a modern rifls^, which he generally carries in the district, and ammunition seems to he sufficiently plentiful to waste in demonstra tions. The above has been observed by me personally, whilst on tour with the assistant adviser. On 21/1/22 we visited a bund, which was being constructed across an irrigation canal. The construction of the bund was a matter of common interest to several tribes in the vicinity; consequently the working j- party was a mixed one. It numbered over a hundred, and most of the men were outside their tribal boundary, Bach man carried a soade in one hand and a rifle in the other. A great deal of time was spent in t hawsa-ing t i.e. war-dancing during which a considerable quantity of ammunition was fired in the air. On 22/1/22 we visited the *Asachrah tribe, who were also constructing a bund. ^ party of about 200 were employed in the - work, b\jt a? they were working within their own .tribal area, the proportion of rifles carried was not so great as in the orevious party. ^ The amount of ammunition wasted in the same way was again noticeable. The way in which the rounds were fired off appeared insolent and the general attitude of the tribesman strmek both the a.D.A. and myself as impertinent. A Shaikh of one of the neighbouring tribes, who happened to be with us, said that if/he had not been with a British Officer, I. nhe feared his life would not hf' Sole. There appears to 'be an idea arrong the. people of this district that the British have put the Arab Government in power to show that the ^rahs are not y^t capable of ruling themselves, and that when the Arabs have shown themselves incapable, the British will again take ov^r the reins of Government. The action oi the jvughash- -ghash on 12th and of Al Juwaibir on 15th together with several minor incidents, all seem to suggest that the tribes are testing Government’s power to control them, by a series of lawless acts. The A.D.A. is of opinion that unless thr- Government slows its authority soon, there will be a state of complete disorder in the district, when no one will be safe and river traffic will be suspended. It is openly stated in the town and district that none of the tribes will pay revenue until compelled to do so by force of arms. Comment action of tribesmen carrying rifle?, when in the territory oi others, ano in addition the posting of sentries on almost every fighting tower gives an idea oi the leap that one -ribe has another, a fear which was neither noticeable nor necessary previously when Government v-as believed to be strong. In addition there is a rumour among the ’Akaikah tribes that tbe Kamalist troops have captured Iosul, Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah and that the British power is on the decline in this country. Apart from personal observation oi tribesmen carrying rifles reports have reached from other sources that every man is armed with a modern rille and a dagger. The general situation will become serious unless some action is shortly taken by Government against an ofiend.j.ng tribe. « Conies to:- G.B.C^. 3. Basrah District. advisers, liasiriyah &amp; Basrah.

Reference your aeaorandua No .2941 d^ted 2ird February l 922 . Personally I do not believe in the existanca of any arofl traffic between Kuwait and Khaaiaiyah, as I fail to see how it could b© carried on - at any rat© on the scale Indicated in report No. B/62/56 from the Special Service Officer, Basrah, - without the Shaikh’s knowledge. The opinion expressed in ny memorandum No. 3?-S of 24th February 1022 regarding the only specific case men- tioned up to the present is borne out by your Memorandum No.So/5o7 dated the 2 nd March. I am quite sure that if the traffic does exist, it is without the Shaikh’s knowledge and contrary to his wishes, as he is certainly opposed to it - in this connection se© my memorandum No. 51-3 dated the 11th March - but. he is such a weak ruler that it is Just possible that it may. I should suggest the following procedure which, if His Excellency agrees, could be arranged through General Headquarters and would clear up once and for all the question of whether this traffic exists or not; namely that the Special Service Officer, Basrah, should send a secret service agent here - he has presumable done so before to obtain the data for his reports - with orders to report to me when one of these caravans of arms has actually left the town, and I could then guarantee to have it overhauled and properly searched. If the agent were told not to come near the Agency except to report the actual departure of a caravan, and were given a letter of introduction, enclosed in a plain unofficial envelope addressed in Arabic, he could get an interview with me at any time without any of my clerks or servants knowing what hisbusiness was. If any arms were found, it would then be a very simple matter to bring pressure to bear on the Shaikh to have the traffic stopped in future. This traffic would be very much easier to deal with than the sea-borne traffic in the Gulf, as, with Jahrah only an hour’s run by car, one could be almost certain of overtaking any caravan one wished to which had not more than two days start.

I humbly and most respectfully beg to state that I have received your honoured letter No.108 dated 23rd of the present month and that it gave ne much pleasure and I thanb you very much for it. You have enquired whether the importation of arms and ammunition from Kuwait into the Persian pofcts has diminished or not. From what I hear it has not decreased and it will not decrease; so long as arms and ammunition are brought to Kuwait by the hinterland Arab Bedouin caravans, it will continue to be imported into Persian ports from Kuwait by any possible way. It is difficult for the Shaikh of Kuwait to stop this and the sellers of the rifles and ammunition, who are•the peoole of Kuwait, help the purchasers, and send the arms by fishing boats and the boats that carry water to a rendezvous fixed between them in the neighbourhood of Kuwait. Another way is that the dealers of arms give rifles and ammunition to the Gosbeh boats which visit Kuwait and they take them to the houses and gardens to the south of Gosbeh and purchasers ship them to Persia from that place. Another way is that the boats intending to import arms put up their sails from the creek after obtaining passes from the Ciastoms and go and remain at the eastern harbour of Kuwait, and rifles and ammunition are taken to them from Kuwait by donkeys at night. Large quantities of riffles and ammunition are imported into Dilun and from there . wagi are sent to Behbehan^And Kuhgeluyeh and from Ahwaz to Ranhormuz and Bakhtiari. The people of Tangestan and Dashti are often at Kuwait for this business and import them easily. If it is possible to stop the Bedouins and Arabs from bringing rifles and ammunition to Kuwait by land it will be a very good thing and the business can be stopped in this way.OOHFIDEH m X IA J± No. 86 -S Political Agency, Kuwait. 5th May I 922 . To The Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E # MEMORANDUM- Reference your memorandum Ko.7^6 dated the 2nd May I 922 . As I stated in my memorandum No. 32 -S &gt; dated the 14th February 1922 , I do not consider that the traffic in arms and ammunition from Kuwait is on nearly such a large scale as Haidar Khan Hayat Daudi, G.I.S. implies; nor do X agree with him that it has not decreased. On the contrary, I believe the traffic has decreased very appreciably in the last four-teen months; and it w 0 uld be strange if it had not, in view of the fact that the late Shaikh Salim made no attempt to stop it, while the present ruler undoubtedly does. The measure which Haidar Khan recommends, viz, the prevent tion of the free import of arms from the desert, is already an accomplished fact, but it must be remembered that the effect of a measure like this xafctsftsk&amp;i cannot be noticeable at once. Another measure which the Shaikh employs for the suppress^! of the traffic is the employment of special secret service agents for the purpose. I do not suppose it will ever be possible to entirely stop the export of arms by sea, as, with a frontage of three miles as Kuwait has, it is easy for a fishing boat leaving at night to take out a rifle or two for transshipment at sea. Of the tkXM methods mentioned in Haidar Khan’s letter three, the fishing boats, water bums and Qasbah boats are probably all used, but I do not believe that the fourth method, that of boat anchoring outside the town to the east and the arms Doing tanen to it by road, is ever employed, as it is obviously(§)/30 &amp; more difficult to get them through the gates in the town wall than to embark them in Kuwait. In this connection please see my memorandum No # 65••S of yesterday^ date. In my opinion a most useful method of keeping the traffic in check is, whenever possible, to bring actual oases home to individuals, and, with this object in view^ i should be glad to have a reply to my memorandum Ng.76-S dated the 13th April I 922 , Political Agent, Kuwaitn / 5 / ' — ^ No. ^'0' 9$^/ SECRETARIAT or h.e. the high COTETISSIOITER JOR f IRAQ,, Baghdad, dated.

The India Office, as you will observe, are in general agreement with the proposal to place the political affairs of Koweit under your control, and the delay in dealing with the matter is entirely due to the refusal on the part of the Foreign Office to agree to the continuance of the arrangement, whereby, the Imperial half of the expenditure involved was borne by the Foreign Office fund.-.

Montagu on the quertion raised in the last paragraph but one of the despatch. Mr. Churchill's impression is that while no official communication on the subject has passed between the India Office and the Colonial Office it has been tacitly understood that so long as Sir P . COX held the post of High Commissioner in 'Iraq, he hould be in charge of the Political affairs of Koweit also. I am to 2 say that this arrangement appears to ir. Churchill to be satisfactory and that he would be glad if v r. Montagu would give his official assent to it, without prejudice to the question of the transfer of /*den, and of the political affairs of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf to the Colonial Office.

INDI„ Oi’J ICS, WHITEHALL, London i 21 et Leoember, 1921. * With reference to ray letter of 28th October P. 4604 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has been in consultation with the Govern ment o 1 India by telegraph and is prepared, pending decision ot the question of the transfer of the political control of the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and aden to the Colonial Office, to agree that the control of the political affairs of Koweit should remain in the hands of Sir P. Cox, while he is the High Commis.:ioner for J’esopo taraia, on the understanding:- 1 . that a moiety only of the expenditure involved ip borne by Indian Revenues, the remaining moiety to be recovered from the Imperial Exchequer as heretofore: 2. that no fresh expenditure is sanctioned by Sir P. Cox or by your Department except with the prior con currence of the Government of India or the Secretary of / State in Council, ■ 3. that this special temporary arrangen ent is not to be cited hereafter against the contention that financial liability must be wholly borne by the authority in which control is zested. As regards the first of these prdvisos Mr. Secretary Churchill will no doubt arrange with the Secretary of Stato for Por^ign Affair^to whose Department a copy of this letter is being sent) which Department The Under Secretary of State, oh 11 Colonial Office.I shall in future contribute the Imperial moiety of expenditure in Koweit. Pending receipt oi a decision on thi^ point the claims on behalf oi the Government of India (which as a rule are presented about' a year in arrear) will continue to be made to the foreign Office. On the understanding indicated above Vr. Secretary Vontagu agrees that the necessary steps .should be taken by . Sir Percy Cox to obtain the co-operation of the Sheikh of Koweit in suppressing the illicit traffic in arms by establish ing a system of registration of rifles bnd ammunition in his territories. As regards the other specific recommendation of the Committee held at Karachi to consider the &gt;».rms Traffic question I am to enclose copies of telegrams exchanged with the Govern ment of India. lr. Secretary liontagu agrees with the Government of India that the present limited extent of the traffic would not justify the reinforcement of the existing Naval forces by a motor boat patrol, and, further, that to grant the local % authorities a standing permission to institute so expensive a measure as he apprehends this patrol would be, would not be / justified till more clear evidence is forthcoming of an impending growth of the traffic to serious proportions. Similarly the Secretary of State agrees that even the comparatively modest expenditure involved in the inotalla- justifiable at the present time, if the installation is, tion and maintenance of a wireless station at Koweit is not^ required only for the purposes of checking gun-running. Should the- installation be required for other purposes, (e.g. in the event of Koweit Bay being developed as an oil-loading port) but remain available as an instrument for anti- arms traffic operations, the Secretary of State would be prepared Viceroy to Secretary of State 2468/s dated 27th October 1921.

To H.E. Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir aa-Subah,G.I.E.,Ruler of Kuwait. A.G. Ihave the honour to send to Your Excellency the following, details regarding a case of trafficing in arms from Kuwait which was recently discovered at Bahrain, &lt;St regarding which I expect you have already heard. On the 20th Dhil Hijjah a Kuwait sailing boat, No.K.T. 4i, nakhuda Fahad bin 'Abdur Rahman al-Balushi,arrived at Bahrain via 'Ujair. The nakhuda declared that he had 32 bags of iron chain and 14 tins of ghi for Bahrain &amp; 2 bund'les of mats &amp; 2 of bishts for Kuwait, but the Customs found that he had additional packages,which on examination were found to contain 12 rifles &amp; 2410 rounds s.A.A.. which had apparently been shii^ped at Kuwait by 'Abdullah al-Juwaisir &lt;Sc were consigned to 'Abdullah bin Rashid of Muharaq.The arms &lt;Sc S.A.A were confiscafed by H.E. the Shaikh of Bahrain, and the boat was # allowed to depart.

Reference Bahrain Diary No. 34 of 1922 for the week ending 25th August 1922, Item No. 121 . T mentioned the case of the rifles and ammunition discover- % in the Kuwait boat at Bahrain to Shaikh Ahmad, and, shortly afterwards, the nakhuda, Pahad bin ’Abdur Rahman al-Balushi, arrived back In Kuwait. The Shaikh at once had him arrested, and, on the 6 th Inst., had him up before him and tried to get him to tell him the name of the man who had shipped them (there is no one in Kuwait of the name given by the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the man with the name llkest to it was away, and it could not have been he). Fahad, however, pleaded ignorance, and told him that he had not even known that the arms were In his boat. On the following morning, as he still refused to tell, the Shaikh had him bound to a post in the market place, with a placard over his head to the effect that 'This man has neither committed adultery nor burglary, but has smuggled arms, and this is how gun-runners are dealt with' 1 . The man was apparently kept there in the sun the entire day, and was carried back to prison unconscious shortly before sunset. The Shaikh told me afterwards what he had done, and said he was very sorry that he could not find out who had shipped the arms as he would very much like to make an example of him, but that he Intended to 'punish? the nakhuda in a suitable manner. X told him that I thought the punishment which he had already given the nakhuda was a distinctly severe one, and should prover ^ ■H &gt;V 3 ttc&amp;L. 3 tonsil /lcc2) thought tho same and had urged him to release the man without any further punlahment, but that he had refused, as he was determined to stamp out this traffic; as, however, I too thought he had been sufficiently punished, he would release him. The Shaikh’a method of dealing with the man was certainly a most drastic one, and it seems almost a wonder that he survived. I think, however, his action is certain to have a most deterrent effect, and I have little doubt that anyone wanting to ship arms from Kuwait to-day would have to i ay a very much higher freight than he would have done a week ago.

Zubeiries and others proceeding to 'Koweit” go as far as KHORA ABDULLAH a distance of two hours by Gharry, thence they proceed in a Sail boat with which they effect the rest of the journey to Koweit. As men travelling from the two oppos ing ends do so generally without passports, hum men and criminals wanted by the Police make thus their escape ’ i i impunity.

A considerable - and, 1 think, IncreaBing - number of . eOi&gt;le certainly do travel by Bailing boat between ^raq and Kuwait by the Khuvruir route, as the waterway near Zub&amp;ir is ueually calleu, and I fancy extremely few of these ever take the trouble to furnifth theceelvea with Certificates of Identity. Although, aa I have already .ointed out to you, geo, le also not unfrequontly cone here via Fao without any papers, yet the route under reference certainly seeae the stfer and wore likely to be used by fugitives from Justice. I ex Iso think it is quite probable that ar^»s xk are smuggled in small quantities by this route, though, if so, I think it is a comparatively new de, arture. In the past arm# used to be taken from Kuwait to the neighbourhood of Khaalslyah, etc. by land, but the present Shaikh of Kuwait is unquestionably trying hia utmost to stamp out the arwa traffic and has confiscated quite a number of rifles being smuggled out of the town through the gates in the town wall, and it nay well be that gun-runnera, finding thla too costly, have adopted the Khuwair route instead. This is naturally much harder to prevent as, although on the land side Kuwait is enclosed by a wall with only three gates in it, its sea front extends for nearly three miles.

Nevertheless, notwithstanding this prohibition, the High Contract ing Parties reserve the right to grant, in respect of arms whose use is not prohibited by International Law, export licences to meet the tequirements of their Governments or those of the Government of any of the High Contracting Parties, but for no other purpose. In the case of firearms and ammunition adapted both to warlike and also to other purposes, the High Contracting Parties reserve to themselves the right to determine from the size, destination, and other circumstances of each shipment for what uses it is intended and to decide in each case whether the provisions of this Article are applicable to it. Article 2. The High Contracting 1 arties undertake to prohibit the export of firearms and ammunition, whether complete or in parts, other than arms and munitions of war, to the areas and zone specified in Article C. Nevertheless, notwithstanding this prohibition, the High Contract ing Parties reserve the right to grant export licences on the under standing that such licences shall be issued only by their own authorities. Such authorities must satisfy themselves in advance that the arms or ammunition for which an export licence is requested are not intended for export to any destination, or for disposal in any way, contrary to the provisions of this Convention.

Article 5. A Central International Office, placed under the control of the League of Nations, shall be established for the purpose of collecting and preserving documents of all kinds exchanged by the High Con tracting Parties with regard to the trade in, and distribution of, the arms and ammunition specified in the present Convention. Each of the High Contracting Parties shall publish an annual report showing the export licences which it may have granted, together with the quantities and destination of the arms and ammuni tion to which the export licences referred.

No withdrawal from a private warehouse shall take place except under licence issued by the local Authority on an application stating the purpose for which the arms or ammunition are required, and supported by a licence to carry arms or by a special permit for the purchase of ammunition. Every arm shall be registered and stamped; the Authority in charge of the control shall enter on the licence to carry arms the mark stamped on the weapon. 5. No one shall without authority transfer to another person either by gift or for any consideration any weapon or ammunition which he is licensed to possess. Article 9. In the prohibited areas and zone specified in Article 6 the manu facture and assembling of arms or ammunition shall be prohibited, except at arsenals established by the local Government or, in the case of countries placed under tutelage, at arsenals established by the local Government, under the control of the mandatory Power, for the defence of its territory or for the maintenance of public order. No arms shall be repaired except at arsenals or establishments licensed by the local Government for this purpose. No such licence shall be granted without guarantees for the observance of the rules of the present Convention. Article 10. Within the prohibited areas specified in Article 6, a State which is compelled to utilise the territory of a contiguous State for the importation of arms or ammunition, whether complete or in parts, or of material or of articles intended for armament, shall be authorised on request to have them transported across the territory of such State. It shall, however, when making any such request, furnish guarantees that the said articles are required for the needs of its own Government, and will at no time be sold, transferred or delivered for private use nor used in any way contrary to the interests of the High Contracting Parties. [1440] B 5Any violation of these conditions shall be formally established in the following manner: — (a) If the importing State is a sovereign independent Power, the proof of the violation shall be advanced by one or more of the Repre sentatives accredited to it of contiguous States among the High Con tracting Parties. After the Representatives of the other contiguous States have, if necessary, been informed, a joint enquiry into the facts by all these Representatives will be opened, and if need be, the importing State will be called upon to furnish explanations. If the gravity of the case should so require, and if the explanations of the importing State are considered unsatisfactory, the Representatives will jointly notify the importing State that all transit licences in its favour are suspended and that all future requests will be refused until it shall have furnished new and satisfactory guarantees. The forms and conditions of the guarantees provided by the present Article shall be agreed upon previously by the Representatives of the contiguous States among the High Contracting Parties. These Representatives shall communicate to each other, as and when issued, the transit licences granted by the competent authorities. (b) If the importing State has been placed under the mandatory system established by the League of Nations, the proof of the viola tion shall be furnished by one of the Pligh Contracting Parties or on its own initiative by the Mandatory Power. The latter shall then notify or demand, as the case may be, the suspension and future refusal of all transit licences. In cases where a violation has been duly proved, no further transit licence shall be granted to the offending State without the previous consent of the Council of the League of Nations. If any proceedings on the part of the importing State or its disturbed condition should threaten the public order of one of the contiguous State signatories of the present Convention, the importa tion in transit of arms, ammunition, material and articles intended for armament shall be refused to the importing State by all the con tiguous States until order has been restored. CHAPTER IV. Maritime Supervision. Article 11. Subject to any contrary provisions in existing special agreements, or in future agreements, provided that in all cases such agreements comply with the provisions of the present Convention, the sovereign State or Mandatory Power shall carry out all supervision and police measures within territorial waters in the prohibited areas and zone specified in Article 6.55 Article 12. Within the prohibited areas and maritime zone specified in Article 6, no native vessel of less than 500 tons burden shall be allowed to ship, discharge, or tranship arms or ammunition. I 1 or this purpose, a vessel shall be considered as a native vessel if she is either owned by a native, or fitted out or commanded by a native, or if more than half of the crew are natives of the countries bordering on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, or the Gulf of Oman. This provision does not apply to lighters or barges, nor to vessels which, without going more than five miles from the shore, are engaged exclusively in the coasting trade between different ports of the same State, Colony, Protectorate or territory under mandate, where warehouses are situated. No cargoes of arms or ammunition shall be shipped on the vessels specified in the preceding paragraph without a special licence from the territorial authority, and all arms or ammunition so shipped shall be subject to the provisions of the present Convention. This licence shall contain all details necessary to establish the nature and quantity of the items of the shipment, the vessel on which the shipment is to be loaded, the name of the ultimate con signee, and the ports of loading and discharge. It shall also be specified thereon that the licence has been issued in conformity with the regulations of the present Convention. The above regulations do not apply: 1. To arms or ammunition conveyed on behalf of the Govern ment, provided that they are accompanied by a duly qualified qfficial. 2. To arms or ammunition in the possession of persons provided with a licence to carry arms, provided such arms are for the personal use of the bearer and are accurately described on his licence. Article 13. To prevent all illicit conveyance of arms or ammunition within the zone of maritime supervision specified in Article 6 (3), native vessels of less than 500 tons burden not exclusively engaged in the coasting trade between different ports of the same State, Colony, Protectorate or territory under mandate, not going more than five miles from the shore, and proceeding to or from any point within the said zone, must carry a manifest of their cargo or similar document specifying the quantities and nature of the goods on board, their origin and destina tion. This document shall remain covered by the secrecy to which it is entitled by the law of the State to which the vessel belongs, and/73 57 must not be examined during the proceedings for the verification of the flag unless the interested party consents thereto. fn) The provisions as to the above-mentioned documents shall not apply to vessels only partially decked, having a maximum crew of ten men, and exclusively employed in fishing within territorial waters. Article 14. Authority to fly the flag of one of the High Contracting Parties within the zone of maritime supervision specified in Article 6 (3) shall be granted only to such native vessels as satisfy all the three following conditions: 1. The owners must be nationals of the Power whose flag they claim to fly. 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate in the district of the authority to which their application is addressed, or must supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may become liable. 3. Such owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been convicted of ilhcit conveyance of the articles referred to in the present Convention. The authorisation must be renewed every year. It shall contain the indications necessary to identify the vessel, the name, tonnage, type of rigging, principal dimensions, registered number, and signal letters. It shall bear the date on which it was granted and the status of the official who granted it. The name of the native vessel and the amount of her tonnage shall be incised and painted in Latin characters on the stern, and the initial letters of the name of the port of registry, as well as the registration number in the series of the numbers of that port, shall he painted in black on the sails. Article 15. Native vessels to which, under the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 13, the regulations relating to the manifest of the cargo are not applicable, shall receive from the territorial or consular autho rities, as the case may be, a special licence, renewable annually and revocable under the conditions provided for in Article 19. This special licence shall show the name of the vessel, her descrip tion, nationality, port of registry, name of captain, name of owner and the waters in which she is allowed to sail. Article 16 The High Contracting Parties agree to apply the following rules in the maritime zone specified in Article 6 (3): —1. When a warship belonging to one of the High Contracting Parties encounters outside territorial waters a native vessel of less than 500 tons burden flying the flag of one of the High Contracting Parties, and the commander of the warship has good reason to believe that the native vessel is flying this flag without being entitled to do so, for the purpose of the illicit conveyance of arms or ammuni tion, he may proceed to verify the nationality of the vessel by examining the document authorising the flying of the flag, but no other papers. 2. With this object, a boat commanded by a commissioned officer in uniform may be sent to visit the suspected vessel after she has been hailed to give notice of such intention. The officer sent on board the vessel shall act with all possible consideration and modera tion ; before leaving the vessel the officer shall draw up a yrocbs- verbal in the form and language in use in his own country. This prochs-verbal shall state the facts of the case and shall be dated and signed by the officer. Should there be on board the warship no commissioned officer other than the commanding officer, the above-prescribed operations may be carried out by the warrant, petty, or non-commissioned officer highest in rank. The captain or master of the vessel visited, as well as the wit nesses, shall be invited to sign the 'proces-verbal, and shall have the right to add to it any explanations which they may consider expedient. 3. If the authorisation to fly the flag cannot be produced, or if this document is not in proper order, the vessel shall be conducted to the nearest port in the zone where there is a competent authority of the Power whose flag has been flown and shall be handed over to such authority. Should the nearest competent authority representing the Power whose flag the vessel has flown be at some port at such a distance from the point of arrest that the warship would have to leave her station or patrol to escort the captured vessel to that port, the fore going regulation need not be carried out In such a case, the vessel may be taken to the nearest port where there is a competent authority of one of the High Contracting Parties of nationality other than that of the warship, and steps shall at once be taken to notify the capture to the competent authority representing the Power concerned. No proceedings shall be taken against the vessel or her crew until the arrival of the representative of the Power whose flag the vessel was flying or without instructions from him. 4. The procedure laid down in paragraph 3 may be followed if, after the verification of the flag and in spite of the production of the manifest, the commander of the warship continues to suspect the native vessel of engaging in the illicit conveyance of arms or ammuni tion. The High Contracting Parties concerned shall appoint in the zone./*S “ ® territorial or consular authorities or special representatives competent to act in the foregoing cases, and shall notify their appointment to the Central Office and to the other Contracting Parties. The suspected vessel may also be handed over to a warship of the nation whose flag she has flown, if the latter consents to take charge of her. Article 17. The High Contracting Parties agree to communicate to the Central Office specimen forms of the documents mentioned in Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15, as well as a detailed list of the licences granted in accord ance with the provisions of this Chapter whenever such licences are granted. Article 18. The authority before whom the suspected vessel has been brought shall institute a full enquiry in accordance with ihe laws and rules of his country in the presence of an officer of the capturing warship. If it is proved at this enquiry that the flag has been illegally flown, the detained vessel shall remain at the disposal of the captor, and those responsible shall be brought before the courts of his country. If it should be established that the use of the flag by the detained vessel was correct, but that the vessel was engaged in the illicit con veyance of arms or ammunition, those responsible shall be brought before the courts of the State under whose flag the vessel sailed. The vessel herself and her cargo shall remain in charge of the authority directing the inquiry. Article 19. Any illicit conveyance or attempted conveyance legally established against the captain or owner of a vessel authorised to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers or holding the licence provided for in Article 15 shall entail the immediate withdrawal of the said autho risation or licence. The High Contracting Parties will take the necessary measures to '•'sure that their territorial authorities or their consuls shall send to Hie Central Office certified copies of all authorisations to fly their flag as soon as such authorisations shall have been granted, as well as notice of withdrawal of any such authorisation. They also undertake to communicate to the said Office copies of the licences provided foi under Article 15. Article 20. The commanding officer of a warship who may have detained a vessel flying a foreign flag shall in all cases make a report thereon to his Government, stating the grounds on which he acted. An extract from this report, together with a cony of the procbs- verbal drawn up by the officer, warrant officer, petty or non-pomrpis-63 h \% o ) sioned officer sent on board the vessel detained shall be sent as soon as possible to the Central Office and at the same time to the Govern ment whose flag the detained vessel was ffying. Article 21. If the authority entrusted with the enquiry decides that the detention and diversion of the vessel or the measures imposed upon her were irregular, he shall fix the amount of the compensation due. If the capturing officer, or the authorities to whom he is subject, do not accept the decision or contest the amount of the compensation awarded, the dispute shall be submitted to a court of arbitration consisting of one arbitrator appointed by the Government whose flag the vessel was flying, one appointed by the Government of the capturing officer, and an umpire chosen by the two arbitrators thus appointed. The two arbitrators shall be chosen ; as far as possible, from among the diplomatic, consular or judicial officers of the High Contracting Parties. These appointments must be made with the least possible delay, and natives in the pay of the Pligh Contracting Parties shall in no case be appointed. Any compensation awarded shall be paid to the person concerned within six months at most from the date of the award. The decision shall be communicated to the Central Office and to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. CHAPTER V. General Provisions. Article 22. The High Contracting Parties who exercise authority over terri tories within the prohibited areas and zone specified in Article 6 agree to take, so far as each may be concerned, the measures required for the enforcement of the present Convention, and in particular for the prosecution and repression of offences against the provisions con tained therein. They shall communicate these measures to the Central Office and to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and shall inform them of the competent authorities referred to in the preceding Articles. The High Contracting Parties will use their best endeavours to secure the accession to the present Convention of other States Members of the League of Nations. This accession shall be notified through the diplomatic channel to the Government of the French Republic, and by it to all the signatory or adhering States. The accession will come into force from the date of such notification to the French Government.Article 24. The High Contracting Parties agree that if any dispute whatever should arise between them relating to the application of the present Convention which cannot be settled by negotiation, this dispute shall l)e submitted to an arbitral tribunal in conformity with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Article 25. All the provisions of former general international Conventions, relating to the matters dealt with in the present Convention, shall be considered as abrogated in so far as they are binding between the Powers which are Parties to the present Convention. Article 26. The present Convention shall be ratified as soon as possible. Each Power will address its ratification to the French Govern ment, who will inform all the other signatory Powers. The ratifications will remain deposited in the archives of the French Government The present Convention shall come into force for each Signatory Power from the date of the deposit of its ratification, and from that moment that Power will be bound in respect of other Powers which have already deposited their ratifications. On the coming into force of the present Convention, the French Government will transmit a certified copy to the Powers which under the Treaties of Peace have undertaken to accept and observe it, and are in consequence placed in the same position as the Contracting Parties. The names of these Powers will be notified to the States which accede. In faith whereof the above-named Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Convention. Done at Paris,* the tenth day of September, one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, in a single copy which will remain deposited in the archives of the Government of the French Republic, and of which authentic copies will be sent to each of the Signatory Powers. * Some of the signatures were affiied in Paris and some at Saint-Germain-en-Lay*.PROTOCOL. At the moment of signing the Convention of even date relating to the trade in arms and ammunition, the undersigned Pleni potentiaries declare in the name of their respective Governments that they would regard it as contrary to the intention of the High Con- tracting Parties and to the spirit of this Convention that, pending' the coming into force of the Convention, a Contracting Party should adopt any measure which is contrary to its provisions.

The gun runners had left JaM*ah before he received infor mation about them, but he at once ordered a pursuit. Unfortu nately, however, he only had two horsemen available at Jahrah, and they did not like the idea of closing with the party when they sighted it, but contented themselves with opening rapid fire in the air to give the impression that there were more of them. Their ruse was apparently successful as the gun runners &gt;whose identity is not known) abandoned the rifles and made off, The rifles had been stripped and made up in a bundle.

Latimer, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Hon’ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. In continuation of Griffith’s demi-official letter No. 2254-PSN, dated the 17th July 1922, I a*m desired to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a note by Ewart on the present position of the armament of Frontier Tribes. Note on the 'present position of the Armament of Frontier Tribes. Generally speaking prices are falling ; the only exception are popular patterns, such as the “ Bandari ” Martini Henry, supplies of which are not up to demand. The figures supplied by the Political Agents of fighting strength and armament are unreliable, but there is no doubt that the total of arms possessed has greatly increased both in quality and quantity. 2. The old Persian Gulf trade of 1909 to 1914 ceased with the commencement of the war and fresh sources of supply were not immediately open. From 1919 onwards this condition has changed and the following sources of supply of arms now exist :— (а) The Kohat Pass and other local factories are still turning out large numbers of • 450 and • 303 rifles and, though prices rule low, there is still a good market for these arms, especially among the most backward (in the armament sense) tribes of the northern border. (б) Losses of all sorts from troops on active service on the Frontier. These were very large in 1919-20, and these losses are by no means balanced by subsequent recoveries—but have decreased in 1921-22. It is to be hoped that this source of supply may now be safely merged in :— (c) Theft by professional arms thieves—Ut Khels, Mamund Bajauris, etc. Some 35 rifles of modern military pattern were stolen from regiments in India in 1921. This, once the main source of supply of arms to the Tribes, is now a very subsidiary one. It is capable of practical extinction if the Criminal Investigation Depart ment, Arms Section, is efficiently worked and sufficiently financed. The profits to be obtained by the't and sale of first class rifles are great, but can be out weighed by the risks, if we really set ourselves to stop this particular branch of the trade. {d) Afghanistan. The re-armament of the Afghan Army with modern rifles bought in Europe—already about 20,000 have been bought, apart from a large number handed over or likely soon to be handed over by the Russians under their treaty and expensive further purchases in progress in Europe—will throw on the market the present Afghan military rifles. Whatever diplomatic steps may be taken to hinder such a result, nothing will prevent these rifles reaching the Frontier tribes if there is a demand for them. Further, there is a distinct possibility of the private importation of arms to Afghanistan by speculators for sale to the tribes. We have already had rumours of the arrival of consign ments of this nature from Germany and there is no doubt that various people, e.g., the German- returned ex-Havildar Guli Jan, Afridi, have dreams of a profitable trade in this direction. (e) Persia, Turkistan and the Middle East generally have been flooded with arms during the war. British, Turco-German and Russian armies have littered countless battle-fields with rifles which local inhabitants have afterwards collected. In Turkistan particularly armies have disintegrated* ahd sold or abandoned their arms locally. Finally, in the process of backing tottering governments and infruc- tuous counter revolutions, thq^British Government has distributed huge quantities of arms and ammunition, often among populations not normally martial, who are only too keen to turn their rifles, through the medium of cash, into ploughshares or bread on the first opportunity. Though I have no special information on this point, I believe Mesopotamia is full of rifles, in spite of large surrenders in 1920-21. At present local conditions may keep most of these in Arab hands, but already we have authenticated instances of Wazirs and Afridis (and I believe, Baluchis) going to Persia to buy the “ Kermani ” rifles, which have already appeared and for which a great demand has been created on the Frontier. The original “ Kermani ” rifle is a Mk. 1 Lee Enfield of 1900 manufacture and appears to be the abandoned armament of the late South Persian Rifles. As such the supply is strictly limited, but the demand having beencreated, enterprising traders from the Frontier can be relied upon to go further afield to meet it and will draw upon other supplies in Persia with the probable result that sooner, rather than later, they will get in touch with Mesopotamian sources of supply. Similarly, we have authenticated cases of the import of arms from Turkistan (a) by Kuchis who ply their camels for hire in Northern Afghanistan in the summer and on the Frontier in the ■winter, (b) by parties of Molpnands, Bajauris and even Wazirs who have been up to Turkistan themselves and bought rities for about Us. 150 which they have sold for Ks. 400 or Rs. 500 in Independent Territory. 3. The above survey of possibilities shows that there is a field for a special enquiry over a wude range to determine the extent of available supplies and the probable future of the Frontier Arms Trade. Personally 1 consider that the results of such enquiry wotild be of little more than academic interest. Our present information is of a general nature only, but it is sufficient to show that great sources of supply exist. Diplomatic and Consular officials in Afghanistan and Persia might with advantage be^placed in possession of a summary of the position and asked to do what th.ey can to hinder the traffic in arms by Frontier Pathans ; but this is not a case like that of the Persian Gulf trade, which we can kill by a definite cordon. No diplomatic or preven tive measures which are feasible can seriously interfere with the natural law of supply and demand. In proportion as Central Asia and the Middle East returns to a state of peace, so will the demand for implements of w r ar contract till only a few communities such as the Kurds and the Frontier Pathans, will furnish the demand to meet the large available supply. Nothing that we can do can prevent our Independent tribes getting all the arms they w'ant increasingly cheaper for several years to come. 4. These prospects are of great importance to the military and Political administration of the Frontier and must be faced.» Our preventive resources in India can only concentrate (a) on the intelligence side of the problem, (b) the prevention of professional theft in India, (c) the pre vention of attempts by revolutionary associations in India, such as the Akali Sikhs, for instance, to obtain arms on the frontier. Such attempts will range from the individual purchase of revolvers, etc., to the smuggling of arms emanating from Bolshevik sources. (Sd.) J. M. EWART, intelligence Bureau, Peshawar.

Though I have no special information on this point, I believe Mesopotamia is full of rifles, in spite of large surrenders in 1920-21. At present local conditions may keep most of these in Arab hands, but already we have authenticated instances of Wazirs and Afridis (and I believe, Baluchis) going to Persia to buy the “ Kermani ” rifles, which have already appeared and for which a great demand has been created on the Frontier. The original “ Kermani ” rifle is a Mk. 1 Lee Enfield of 1900 manufacture and appears to be the abandoned armament of the late South Persian Rifles. As such the supply is strictly limited, but the demand having been2 * created, enterprising traders from the Frontier can be relied upon to go further afield to meet it and will draw un6n other supplies in Persia with the probable result that sooner, rather than later, they will get in touch with Mesopotamian sources of supply. Similarly, we have authenticated cases of the import of arms from Turkistan (o) by Kuchis who ply their camels for hire in Northern Afghanistan in the summer and on the Frontier in the winter, (b) by parties of Mohmands, Bajauris and even Wazirs who have been up to Turkistan themselves and bought rifles for about Rs. 150 which they have sold for Rs. 400 or Rs. 500 in Independent Territory. 3. The above survey of possibilities shows that there is a field for a special enquiry over a wide range to determine the extent of available supplies and the probable future of the Frontier Arms Trade. Personally 1 consider that the results of such enquiry would be of little more than academic interest. Our present information is of a general nature only, but it is sufficient to show that great sources of supply exist. Diplomatic and Consular officials in Afghanistan and Persia might with advantage be placed in possession of a summary of the position and asked to do what they can to hinder the traffic in arms by Frontier Pathans ; but this is not a case like that of the Persian Gulf trade, which we can kill by a definite cordon. No diplomatic or preven tive measures which axe feasible can seriously interfere with the natural law r of supply and demand. In proportion as Central Asia and the Middle East returns to a state of peace, so will the demand for implements of w^ar contract till only a few communities such as the Kurds and the Frontier Pathans, will furnish the demand to meet the large available supply. Nothing that we can do can prevent our Independent tribes getting all the arms they; w T ant increasingly cheaper for several years to come. 4. These'prospects are of great importance to the military and Political administration of the Frontier and must be faced. Our preventive resources in India can only concentrate (a) on the intelligence side of the problem, (b) the prevention of professional theft in India, (c) the pre vention of attempts by revolutionary associations in India, such as the Akali Sikhs, for instance, to obtain arms on the frontier. Such attempts will range from the individual purchase of revolvers, etc., to the smuggling of arms emanating from Bolshevik sources. (Sd.) J. M.

In all probability a small number of theee arms hav*» already reached the tribes of the Shamiyah direct irom Syria, but arms which reach Kuwait are brought by the above-mentioned dealers who s^-nd to the Shamlyah aa nany arms as possible for sale amongst the tribes there. The forces which I previously »ent to uraue the ar a dealers have frightened gun-running caravans and for the last four months, with the exception oi the arrival of two gun-running caravans, the importation oi arms nua been greatly diminished. On the arrival of the two caravans just mentioned, 1 despatched a force oi ounted constables to confiscate the arms, but without success.
