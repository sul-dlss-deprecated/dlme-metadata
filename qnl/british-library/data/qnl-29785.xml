Almost coincident with the murder of the Wali Sulaiman bin Suwailim at AKK in Sharqiyah in February 1907, the A1 Kathir tribe rose against his deputy BAKHIT, a negro slave, in Dhufar. The osten sible cause t/as the murder of Shaikh La f ait of the A1 Kathir by Bakhit’s askers. Three of the slaves of the late Wali were killed, and the A1 Kathir even went to the extent of applying to the Sultan of Mokalla for protection. In consequence of these disturbances the Sultan sent his son Saiyid Taimur in January 1908 to Dhufar in the Nur-al-Bahr, and H.M.S. Perseus was instructed to proceed to Shufar to show the flag and to lend Saiyid Taimur moral support. The latter was however successful in settling up affairs, and brought Bakhit back with him to Muscat, leaving Bakhit f s son and one Abdin Kasim Ali, a Bohra of Bombay, in charge of affairs at Dhufar, actually returning before the arrival of H.M.S. Perseus at Dhufar. Bakhit was reappointed Wali in October 1908, and remained as such till December 1915, when the Sultan, Saiyid Taimur, ov/ing to complaints of misgovernment, himself proceeded to Dhufar and appointed Abdullah bin Sulaiman al Harithi as Wali in his place. 1 In March 1918 the Sultan paid a visit lasting over a month to Dhufar. During his visit he afforded protection to two slaves who had swum offto his ship, and arranged to compensate the Shaikh who was their master by a payment of 1200 dollars from his Customs at Dhufar. After the return of the Sultan to Muscat a serious fracas arose over some delay in the payment of the second instalment of this compensation, in which an Aqid named Muhammad bin Abdul Latif who was also manager of the Customs was murdered. Affairs in fact assumed such a threatening aspect that the Sultan applied to the Political Agent for assistance in the form of a transport to carry reinforcements to Dhufar. This was, however, not forthcoming, and the disturbance eventually quieted down. At the end of 1922 the Wali Abdullah bin Sulaiman died at Mokalla on his way to Muscat on leave, and affairs were carried on by his deputy, a negro slave from Mokalla. In April 1923 the Sultan proceeded to Dhufar on H.M.S. Triad with the intention of taking up his residence there for the summer. He was accompanied by the new Wali, Saoud bin Ali bin Badr and a considerable party. The Political Agent at Muscat, Mr. Wingate visited Dhufar at the same time. The country at this time appeared both peaceful and prosperous. Opinion was unanimous that i the population had increased in the last fifteen years, and the towns showed a noticeable increase of substantial *buildings since Major Gray*s visit in 1906. This state of affairs is probably due to the policy of non-interference, based oncomplete impotence, pursued by the Muscat local representatives. Very little revenue is collected, and that only from the sea customs and the lands in the immediate vicinity of Dhufar proper, and it no more thansuffices for the very modest establishment which the Wali keeps up. The country runs itself on the tribal system, with the occasional raids and murders that this system entails, but in the absence of the danger of organised foreign invasion it may be asserted without hesitation that it is the most suitable one in the present condition of the country. The existence of the Muscat Government exercises a mild moral restraint on the extremer forms of inter tribal warfare, a restraint reinforced by recollection of the d*ays of the Wali Sulaiman bin Suwailim, and as long as it maintains its present policy’and continues to extract the minimum revenue and to entertain visiting shaikhs, there is no valid reason why the Sultan should not be able to retain his suzerainty.HISTORY OF DHUFAR To be aided after the last paragraph of the History of DHUFAR on page 601 of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Volumae X Part 1, Historical# j Almost coincident with the murder of the Wall Sulalman bln Suwallim at ft AKK in Sharqiyah in February 1907, the A1 Kathir tribe rose against his deputy BAKHIT, a negro slave, in Dhufar# The osten sible cause was the murder of Shaikh La'alt of the A1 Kathir by Bakhit's askers# Three of the slaves of J the late Wall were killed, and the A1 Kathir even went to the extent of applying to the Sultan of Mokalla for protection# In consequence of these disturbances the Sultan sent his son Saiyid Taimur in January 1908 to Dhufar in the Nur-al-Bahr, and H#M.8,Perseus was instructed to proceed to Dhufar to show the flag and to lend Saiyid Taimur moral support.

O.I.I, Politioal Resident In the Persian Gulf BU 3 HIRE 4 th Bay 1983. 2 hare the honour to report that Hla Highness the Sultan of Muscat with a party consisting of two of his brothers, three of his cousins ( sons of itohamal bln Turfcl ) anl various other notables left for Dhofar on H.M,S«Trla&amp; on the nth April. I an! the Consular Dragoman also travelled with the party. We arrived at Murbat on the afternoon of the 14th where we found one of the dhows which had been sent previously fron Muscat. The second dhow, it was ascertained subsequently had had to return to Muscat owing to stress of weather. His Highness did not land, but the Sheikhs of Murbat and of the neighbouring tribes visited hi* on hoard. On the morning of the 16 th I landed at Murbat and visited the town and the shrine of Muhammad bin All, dated 6 &amp;C A.H. Wo left about c a.a taking the Sultan's dhow in tow and anchored atlinxtn Dhufar about 8.SO p.m. His Hlghneaa laft the ship at 4 p.m »•- under the usual salute. T I landed on the loth, 17th and 18th, xjcxjcIcjigxjshftxStH&amp;jtKzix to visit the Sultan and see the surrounding country. I also paid a visit to the house ♦ of Saiyid Aqil bin Ahmad Dhahah, the wealthiest and most prominent of the Saiyids of Dhufar. In general the country seems to be somewhat more prosperius than when Major Grey visited in it in 1906, and the popul ation has slightly increased. There have been no outstanding events since that date, and the country has been comparatively peaceful. Raids by Bedouin on the settled districts have been very few. On the other hand the authority of the Muscat Government may be said to be almost nil. A representative has been maintained who has been left in peacebut he has seldom extracted any revenue from the province, and none has ever been remitted to Muscat. In fact the country may be said to run itself on the tribal system, a satisfactory condition of affairs which pleases everybody. I attach a detailed revision of the geographical portions of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf concerned with the country, and also a note on the history of Dhufar from 1906 to the present date to be added to the History of Dhufar at page 601 of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol.l.Historical. &gt; ' I His Highness and his retinue are occupy- .. ^ -Ing the fort,Al Hisn, which is in reality a small village. He does not contemplate returning to Muscat &gt; before the end of November or the beginning of December. In any case ot would be impossible for him to return before October owing to t}ae monsoon during which Dhufar is out off from all communication withthe outer world. It will be Impossible even to aeni him letters or to receive news from him from June to September. The Sultan^ object in staying in Dhufar is undoubtedly to save money, and I believe he intends to visit Egypt next year. It is improbable that he will do anything else in Dhufar beyond reside there. He hopes to be able to arrange his return voyage on one of the Anglo®Persian Oil Company tankers returning empty from England. He expressed the most sincere gratitude for the kindness of Government in permitting him to travel on one of His Majesty*s ships, and the liveliest satisfaction at the admirable arrangements made for his entertainment on board, which he expressed personally to the Senior Naval Officer and his officers, and he desired me to convey to Government his thanks. We left Dhufar on the moxK afternoon of the lath and arrived at Sur the morning of the aist where I landed to conduct the registration of Britisn subjects. The latter have increased and now number thirty five. Sur is, as usual, flourishing, but a certain amount of insecurity exists, and the Wall who lives three miles away at Bilad has little authority. The peculiar conditions of Sur make such a state of affairs inevitable, and that affairs are no worse than they are is a credit to the present Wall. We left Sur that evening, the Senior Naval Officer very kindly taking on board the Wall who had received an urgent summons owing to the dangerous stae of his brother^ health, and arrived at Muscat next morning, tne a$nd.
