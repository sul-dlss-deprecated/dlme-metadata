The information contained will be very useful to us here. I think you also said that regulations had been made regarding through cargo carried by pl^Jies but disembarked in India from one plane for onward carriage in another. If you have anything I could see in regard to this it would be most useful to us. Yours Sincerely, G.N.Bower Esquire, Customs iiouse, Karachi.Political ^enqy, Baiirain, the 30th . pril 1932. Dear Belgrave, I send you herewith the papers I received from Bower in connection with the bonding of aircraft stores and parts# I think something very much less complicated could be arranged for Bahrain should the aeropli nee come this way, and if eaiy i perial Airways^ come some thing far simpler might be devised. I have not,however,received the procedure as regards cargo that is disembarked from one plane in India for onward transmission by another plane to a destination outside India^and I am asking for it^aadr if I receive it I will send you a copy. Yours Sincerely, C.D.Belgrave s uire, adviser to the Bahrain uovernment, ahrain.f May 5th, 1932. I thank you for the papers from Bower explaining Bond system in India in the case of aeroplanes. The Imperial Airways representative asked if this Government would allow them a reduction in Customs dues on their imports, he was informed that this would not be possible but the Government would not collect Customs on the petrol actually on the machines when brought into Bahrain neither on cargo manifested for another port provided that suitable measures were adopted to prevent any such cargo being distri buted here. On all imports and on all cargo destined for Bahrain the ordinary Customs dues would be col lected. ^7^ ^7 ^ ^ ^ ^ Captain C. G. Prior, Bahrain. 'SiV72-/ ' Custom iloaae , Karachi, the 1.4th May 1932 . ■f A lA' ft D .O.C,Nq.841/31. K My dear Prior, Please refer to your ^.0.No.422 dated 20th April 1932. 2. If you have not already got a copy of the Indian Aircraft Rule s, 1920 , aad the amendments whi :h appeared on page 434,^t seq , of the Gazette of India, Part I, dated April the 9th, 1932 , I suggest that you should get a copy. 3. Until recently our practice was for all cargo carried by air consigned to any place in India or Burma to be cleared at the first Customs aerodrome of call in India, i.e. 'Bast-bound planes would have their cargo accounted for at Karachi an'l the TSTest-bound planes at Rangoon, -his arrangement however is liable to cause delay and is open to several practical difficulties, e .g. the absence of the consignee's invoices, etc., necessitates either examination and appraisement by the Customs Officer at the Customs aerodrome at Drigh ^oad, who is not an expert Appraiser, or the detention of packages for production at the Custom House^t Karachi and the consequent forwarding by rail or by the following week's plane. I have accordingly recommended that carg3 consigned to places which have not been declared to be Customs aerodromes should be allowed to go forward in the sane plane(or transferred to an on-carrying plane)without examination or assessment, provided they are clearly shown on the Export Manifest. If necessary such cargo f or the compartment in which it is carried^ill be sealed with a Customs seal. It will still be necessary for cargo consigned to inland aerodromes which have not been declared to be Customs aerodrome s (e . g, Jodhpur, Allahabad , etc.) to be assessed and duty collected at e.g. Karachi. 4. So far as Bahrein is concerned I do not think tlsiKt j'-ou should have any difficulty as presumably you will collect duty only on packages consigned to Bahrein ax and so long as you are satisfied that 'same bottom cargo' actually goes f orward// forward by the same plane(or is transferred to an on-carrying plane) no duty will be levied. I suggest that the 2% transit duty which used to be levied on transhipment cargo for the mainland should not be made applicable to cargo carried by air. Apart fron^' in equity' of such a levy in the case of transit by air I do not think you would find the ^game worth the candle'. .When I have received the final orders on the suggestions made in para 3 above I will send you a copy of our revised Standing Order on the subject. Yours sincerely. 14.5.32. Capt. C.Cr.Prior, H,B # M. Agency, Bahrein (Persian G-ulf), KHHG.N•Bower Esquire, Customs house. Karachi • • D-O.No: £^1 . Political Agency, Bahrain,tae 29th May 1932. Lear Bower, :any than..^ for your D.O.flo:841/31 dated the 14th '.'ay 1932 and for the trouble you have taken in the matter. The Bahrain Government have decided not to levy the 2^ transit duty on through cargo and as you say it should be quite easy to see that such cargo does go on and is not smu^;led into Bahrain. I find that we have no copy of the Indian Aircraft Rules ana i am ordering one. I will be glad to receive a co|;y of your revised Standing Order on the subject when it is finally cecided upon.
