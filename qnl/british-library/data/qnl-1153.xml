LE UUFY /AA/1/3VTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannG. MAjis^V' boo YERNMENT GE MENTS) ^RCHW £9 January 15, 1948 Section 1 SPEECH BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT THE SIGNATURE OF THE ANGLO-IRAQI TREATY, 15th JANUARY, 1948 Prime Minister, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to express the gratitude of His Majesty’s Govern ment and, I am sure, of our visitors to-day, to you, your town clerk, and your staff for the arrangements they have made for this ceremony At such short notice. We are very glad to be in Portsmouth. This city bears the scars of enemy attack. It also bears the formidable appearance of continuity, in spite of that attack, and it is an indication not only of the vindication of British policy in fighting Nazism and aggression, but it is an indication of the determination of the people of this country to maintain for themselves, and, as far as they can, for the people of the world, the principles of liberty and social justice. To-day we have met to sign a new treaty with Iraq, and nothing has given me per sonally greater pleasure than to have had the opportunity of meeting the Prime Minister of Iraq, the Foreign Secretary, Minister of Defence, and the ex-Prime Ministers of that country in these negotia tions. These, my Lord Mayor, have not been the kind of negotiations wherein two people seek to take advantage of one another, or to reconcile grievances; they have been negotiations to put our friend ship into words in accordance with the stage that our actual relationships have reached. We have removed everything that was objectionable in the old treaty and we have established in this one what has been, in fact, the practice for some time, and that is, to meet each other on terms of absolute equality, and to determine to make our mutual contribution according to our capacity, our strength, our man-power, and our will to the peaceof the world. Secondly, this treaty is the beginning of a new series of treaties regularising and expressing the friendship between this country and the Arabic world. We prize that friendship. I am sure that they equally value it too. We believe that both of us have a contri bution to make. We are determined to make it, and I therefore proceed to the signature of this treaty to-day, if I may say so, almost with a nice omen, for the sun is shining upon us, which I think is a good augury, an augury that we have done right, that we have confirmed this friend ship, and that we shall carry it through together so as to establish a link between the great Arabic peoples and ourselves, and to preserve what is valuable to them and to us, each with our independence, but each making a contribution. 110-141(K. 1323/1323/ 93) FOR'ION OFFICF• 8.W.1 7th February, 1948.

Vhat I will cay about Iraqi foreign policy la derlTed mainly fron ay paraonal axparlaaea and from tha policy of tha Government, tha reaponelbllity of vhlch X share. That la vhy I hope you vill not expect froft me an erudite scholarly lecture, but rather an informal frank talk about the foreign affaira of Iraq. In order to appreciate the preaeut day foreign policy of Iraq, it might be uaeful to go back to the formation of the modern atate of Iraq end trace the working of ita foreign policy. Thus ve may divide this development Into three stage a; (1) The pre-independence period. (2) From independence in 1932 till Vorld bar IX. (3) From Vorld Var IX until today. i. the radana mami mm Aa you know, the new Iraq waa born after Vorld Var I. Before that it waa a pert of the Ottoman Empire. It constated of the three ex Vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basrah. The fate of this area after Vorld Var I was determined by two factors, British occupation and Arab ren&amp;iaance and revolt. I need not go into the history of BritishUUr»»t» In Ir** 1* tht d«y&gt; »f iht OIUmmo tapir*. Zt It a knovn fict that Brltiah ©ownarcial rvlatloaahlp with Iraq flourished durlnf ths 19th century onward. Britain also thought of Iraq ss a possible route to India before the Suet Canal was opened. The Chesney expedition through the Euphrates in the first half of the last century was an sttsnpt at finding a short cut to India. The Iraqis on their p*rt did good trade vith British eerchants. At a later date Britain developed an interest in Iraqi oil and a fear of the Baghdad-Berlin railway, accompanied by German desire for the exploitation of Iraq. These facts no doubt contributed to creating the desire on the p^rt of Great Britain for the occupation of Iraq In Vorld Var I. The Iraqis on their part had been influenced by the impact of modern nationalism, which crept from the vest to the Ottoman Empire and made the Arabs, liks other nationalities forming ths Ottoman tapire, yearn for cultural revival and the liberation from the Ottoman yoke. The Arab nationalist movement was at first underground. Iraqi young men who were studying at Istanbul, took active pfcrt in the formation of secret societies, specially since the young Turk movement launched on a policy of Turkifying all the nationalities of the Ottoman tapirs. Other Iracls took part in secret societies In Baghdad and Basrah. Some Iraqi students joined the Arab nationalist activities in Paris in 1908. The Ottoman tapire did not look with sympathy at these movements. Vhen world Var I came, persecution of Arab nationalists in Irsq, Syria and Lebanon vent on. Jrmal Pasha, the Ottoman Governor of Syria hanged a good number of nationalists in the public squares of Demascus and Beirut. The Arab natl'nailst movement vent on germinating underground before and during World V«r I, and it did not sprout until the Arab revolt in 1916 was declared by His Ute Majeety King Hussain of Hajas, whose four sons took command of the Areb revolt. Many Iraqis who had their military training in Istanbul,Joined the Arab revolt. It is a wall-known fact that talr Peisal who vaa himself an ambodiment of Arab nationalism and a leader in Arab revolt, became later on the first Xing of Iraq, while many young Iraqi officer* in the Arab revolt hold positions of leadership In Iraq today. During World War I, the Arabs,had ho pad to ischloro tholr libormtlon and unity W'ich r-v they had lo-t for eonturlaa. But alasl Povar politiea do not alvaya honour rlfht and /raadonl if tar the Var tha trab world found itaalf cut to placaa f Britain occupying Irao and Palaetina, iaauin^ tha Balfour tacl^r^ti n vlthout tha &lt;nowladga or conaant of th* Ar^ba, and Franc# occupying Syria and Labanon, and not aatiafiad with tha cutting away ^ l^ftina from tha original Syriaj cut Syria itralf into four placas* Britain la tar on cut Palestine into Palestine and Tran* Jordan, hence tha Arab Nationalists, Including nany Iraqis, cane out from Vorld Var I with great disappointment and dlsllluslonaent v Iraq was put under tha British Mandate* A new struggle for nati mal liberation and u^ity started. Tha Iraqis newer acquiesced in the British occupation. Unrest led to the 1920 resolution. Britain wary soon realised that it paid her better to ollov »n ewoiutionary course in Iraq and hence consent to the people f s desire for establishing a nationalist gorernnent. King Faisal I, after being dethroned in Syria by the French, was incited by the Iraqis to come and be their flrat monarch. King Faisal, whose rtatesmanship was #lrr ‘' ' v ln evid&lt;mct in ^ Arab revolt and in defending the Arabs 1 cause at the Fari. Peace-Conference, was a far sighted and shrewd statesman. He soon determined to establish th. new Irao on a solid foundation of Mritl-h friendship and he realised that with the help of Britain he might pte ily build a new Iraq, and at the same ti*e use Iraq as a base for Arab liberation and unity. By his wisdom and siatasmanship, he steadily progressicaly steered the course of Iraq towards independence. The ty of 1930 between Iraq and Great BriUin, which enabled Iraq to join the of Nations in 1932, was tha culminaUon of King Faisal's efforts to establish Iraq's political existence. 11 IBS re*lOE BtTVE.fN ry pgFEHDINCl ANL 'WORLD fr p ^ ^ soon as Iraq became a member of the League of Nations, a seriesof .ffort. v.r.

These students were Uufht to beco^ epos ties of Areb unity. The liberation of Syria aad Pelestine occupied the minds of the Ir*Qi nationalists eore than any other subject. The danger besetting the rr^bs of Palestine was • special cause of anxiety tnd of anti-British campaign, especially during the years 1936 onwards. Iraqi efforts for the support of the Arabs of Paleetine and the liberation of Syria were Tory apparent. Iasi propaganda did not fail to exploit the reel danger besetting thaArebe of Paleetine, by carrying out a strong anti-British Campaign. The issue of Palestine beg*»n to occupy Iraqi minds to such an extent that today it cannot be cocsidered as s foreign issue. Iraqis consider the Paleetine issue as an Iraqi issue, for which we are directly concerned, and the present Government registered this fact in its platfora of policy. The reaeont for this attitude ere not very herd to find 9 In the first place Palestine in the heart of the Arab world and without it there can be no Arab unity. In the second place Palestine is a natural seaboard of Iraq. Ira^e petroleum has mainly to be exported through Haifa and the construction of the Baghdad- Haifa railway was often mentioned as a possibility. In the third place. Iraq has a good Jewish minority, amounting to some 120,000.

This good relationship culmlnAted In tha signature of tha Sa dabed Pact batvaam Iran, Iraq, Turkey sad Afghanistan on July 8th, 1937.

The support of the Great Powers certainly led to the final liberation of Syria and Lebanon from the French yoke* At about the same time Great Britain announced her intention to terminate her Mandate over Transjordan and grant her independence* Thus s part of Iraq's objective was realised by the independence of these three Arab states* Palestine however remains s sore spot in the body of the Arab world and Arab struggle for Palestine will continue until Zionist designs over the Arab world are finally abandoned* A few month a before the conference of San Francisco, the Arab League was instituted as a first step towards Arab unity* Iraq was one of the champions of the Arab League movement and did a good da&amp;l towards its mstarialisation* It is trua that Mr* Anthony Idan gave tha blaecings ef tha United Kingdom's Government to tha creation of the Arab League,I? but th^t bl&lt;s«iB£ could by no •ccac hiTu bcuu th* caucc of lie rculicution # for tho Arub Loofuo 1c nothing uoro then an ozproccion of an ideal vbioh Kmy boon aotiro in tho ninda of Arab Loadora ainco v orld War !• Today tb# Arab Loaguo and ita growth ia one of the nain linoa along which Iraqi foreign policy nowaa, for Iraq want* the Arab Loagua to aohioro liberation, unity and cultural reuaieenoo for all Arab countriea fron Caaablanoa to Baaralu Smm Iraqi thinkara are inpatient with the Arab League* They want it to achieve no re and to novo no re quickly* But the fact ran* ine that the Ideale of the League cannot be challenged by any true Arab natiooelict in Iraq* It ia a well known fact thet the eta tea forming the Arab League wary in their atagea of aocial and cultural deweloj»cat, but the fact that all Arabe bare one eounon language, one culture and one hiatory and the fact that they all a ha re the eane Ideale of achieving freedom, unity and progreea, nakee the Arab League a no at vital organ! action for the Arab world* Fortunetaly art!cl# 9 of the Covenant of the Arab Laagua, providaa that thoae Arab statea who want to aehlevt eloaer unity the Arab Laague itaalf aehievaa, are entitled to do eo* It ie with a doeire for a closer unity eeeording to the provision of the Covenent of the Arab Leagna that Iraq and Transjordan signed e Treaty of Brotharhood and Alliane# a few nontha ago* About the sana tint Iraq signad a new Treaty of fri and ship and Allianea with Turkay, ttaua fortifying the Saadabad Pact* Iraq today attaches greater inportanee to this Feet than it did bafore the war, and it is hepsd that this Fact will ba revitalised and it# basis broadened so that it night probably ineluda Greeea and Pakistan* Iraq ia historically and geographically in a position to act as a connacting link between the states of the Arab League end the statea of the Saadabad Pact* It nay well work for a eloaer unity between these two groups of states to provide e solid block for intexmatioaal peace end security. The world today la by no means settled* The division of the Greet Pevere into Veateru and Eastern blacks presents e reel danger for tbo future* This division baa made the United latlons rather impotent insettling world affairs* Iraq today has two prsblaas which are direetly connected with the world situation. The first is its desire for an erolmtiooarjr progress and derelepnent of its rich resources, in order to raise the standard of living of the people* It intends to launch on groat Irrigations! and agricultural ache me a. It has to enlarge and inprove its ays tens of coenuni cation, to increase its oonnerce and to develop local industry* It cannot tolerate coonunian and has always to keep a watch on subversive novanante which night creep in f#on outside *nd upset its social evolution and political ays tee* Thus in the conflict between the secial and political ideologies of last and boat, Iraq finds that it has such in rnennn with the social and political ideology of Groat Britain, which wo think presents the golden noene between Anerican right and Russian left* The eeoond Mg pro Men which faces Imq and whith has sons to have vast international conplicationa, is that of Palestine* The British Mandate over Palestine achieved what it cot out to achieve, namely e Jewish national hone in Palestine* This national hone never neent to became a Jewish state, nor did it intend that Palestine was to resolve unlimited Jewish immigration* The Zionists developed aims and ambitions to which they are not anti tied* They exploited the misery of the Jews in D*P* Camps and the persecutions made by Hitler for their own political aods* Thay vara ahla to play poll tie a la the United States of Amexi.ee and to nake the American Government take e resh step in supporting the idea of a Jewish state* The United States of America om her pert used her influence in the United Bat ion a to muster votes in the General Assembly for a proposal which is not just, not workable end not conducive to pe»ee* The General Assembly has no legal authority to reoommemd the partition of Palestine by fores against the via bee of the majority of its inhabitants* Chapter 4 of the Charter defines the function! of the General AseemMy solely in terns of study and discussion of international situations and reoonmsndlng measures for the peaceful adjustment of any situation* (Article U)* In the light of current events, no one sen elsln that the United latlons' decision on partition vac of tha natureEX i ! 5465 n a adJustMt of tko M^noo^or, tbo Conoral IsoaBblj is not anUorlsod by tbs Chartsr to appoint a co^itUo to UplMMOt partition.

Minister gave repeated assurances that Cabinet desired collaboration with and assistance from United Kingdom. He said that speed of negotiation of new treaty had shocked public opinion and he also complained of treaty’s form. He failed, however, to make precise objections on any point and refused to discuss treaty in anything but generalities. 2. Mr. Busk said that United Kingdom Government and public would » judge Iraqi Government not by vague assurances of friendship but by their deeds. It was up to them to remedy grievous effect their action was bound to have in London by publicly demonstrating what they so profusely promised in private. 3. Minister then gave Mr. Busk official communication to effect that: - (i) after reviewing new treaty, Council of Ministers considered that it did not realise aims of Iraq and was not a fit instrument for strengthening ties ol friendship between Iraq and Great Britain, (ii) they had therefore decided on its rejection nnd asked Charge d f Affaires to convey this to his Government at same time making it clear that Iraqi Guvernment continue to desire replacement of Treaty of Alliance of 1930 by a new Treaty. /4.
