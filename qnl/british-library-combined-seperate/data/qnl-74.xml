The numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and appear in the top right hand corner of the recto page of each folio. Foliation anomaly: ff. 1, 1A.Pagination: a pagination sequence numbered 1-176 runs between ff. 2-89. These numbers are written in ink and appear in the top right (recto) or top left (verso) corner of each page. Damage to the edges of the pages has resulted in the loss of some of these numbers. In consequence, the pagination sequence has been duplicated in pencil on each page; these numbers appear in the top centre of each page and are not circled.Condition: the volume has suffered damage to the edges of many of the folios. This has resulted in the loss of some of the pagination numbers (as above) and (particularly between ff. 2-22) the ends of some lines of text; however, the missing text can generally be reconstructed. There are also two holes in the top centre and top right of folios 1-11. These have also occasioned some loss of text, but the sense of the original is generally unaffected.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume consists of chronological entries containing transcripts of correspondence sent and received, and notes on the arrival and departure of vessels at Bushire.
