Gv/adur as you know was given to the Sultan of Maskat by a former Khan of Kalat about 1800♦ Recently a suggestion was made that we should endeavour to detach Gwadur from the possession of the Sultan in Oman in such a way that we could claim to regara the AngiO^French protectorate as applying only to the latter. This ; I am afraid is not possible for there is practically no aiifereiiCe between tife Sultan’s tenure of Gwadur and his tenure of Oman^ and though it is extremely unlikely that any Foreign power would venture to interfere with Gwadur, still it would be very satisfactory if it were possible to secure its rendition to Kalat.lt probably would be inexpedient for us to appear 'v ' in the matter,and I expect that the only way to bring about such a rendition would be for the Khan of Kalat to write to the Sultan and offer to buy the place back. Do you think ! t there is the smallest probability that the Sultan would listen to such a proposal. Does he lay great store en Gwadur, or do ! you think he would be open to an offer. I should like to have your opinion on this suggestion, and perhaps you could also tell us what income the Sultan receives from Gwadur.I ^ ■ d0 not suppose that he gets very much. If the suggestionwere ever put before the Sultan^it could be justified, not x ‘ w “’ by our political necessities which are not urgent, but by his own financial needs which usually are* If you think the proposal one that is worth proceeding withal daresay we could get the Khan of Kalat to make an offer, on the ground of his growing need for a port in Mekran* L Captain P*Z«Cox Political Agent Maskst- I Muscat Feb %2hd 1S0S3. Ajs you will have seen from the enclosure to my official letter ITo.96 of 14th Feb, the subject of Gwadur had cropped up spmew^at prominent ly just before your demi-official letter of BBth January reached me. ? In the course of the conversation^with the Sultan thereindentioned, the latter asked me, probably having fhov/ers' expedition in his thoughts, ^what was the posi tion of the tribes in ithe hinterland beyond the limits of his territory at Gwadur. Speaking off hand. 1 tolo him that they were regarded as subject or trinotary to tie Klian of Kelat, but that the extent of their subjec- ^ tion probably depended, on the same considerations as did that of the sheikh's of Oman to the Ruler of Muscat for the time being.

The principal of these (Gwadur) was acquired by Muscat, according to the most trust worthy accounts, in the following manner. During the reign of the Imam Saeed bin Ahmed at Muscat, his younger brother Sultan, ambitious and ‘GwadufT restless, aimed at usurping his power. Being at first un successful, Sultan was compelled to fly, and crossed the sea to Gwadur, recently annexed by Nasir Khan. Prom Gwadur he performed a journey to Kholat, and besought the aid of Nasir in his undertakings. The Khan dismissed him with a grant of the port of Gwadur, then an insignificant fishing village, a grant, in which there will appear nothing extraordinary or unusual to those familiar with the usages of Oriental Princes. Sultan resided some time at Gwadur, and eventually, in the year 1797, succeeded in usurping the Sultanate of Muscat. Thence-forward he and his successors retained their hold of Gwadar, which was fortified and improved.

S« BUSSBIX, Esq., C.S., Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Last year Wood asked roe to make some enquiries about Gwadur, and I sent him a copy of a note written by Mirza Sher Muhammad, the man who is doing my Gazetteer work in the Jhalawan country. It was prepared from information which had been obtained at Kalat. I have recently had opportunities of making further enquiries and of examining the accu racy of the first account. I wrote a-letter to the e^-Khan of Kalat at Loralai, asking for in formation about Gwadur for the Gazetteer, and I told one of my men, Maulvi Abdurrab, who is now working in Mekran in connection with the preparation of the Gazetteer, to get me quietly such information as he might pick up at Gwadur and at Kech, The reply of the ?a&gt;Khan of Kalat, of which I enclose a copy, speaks for itself. Shortly, he declares that Mir Nasir Khan([)* * made over * Note. —The previous report alleged that it is Mir ^i ie re venues of the port of Gwadur to an ancestor M&amp;hmud Khan (I), who handed over the place to ^ ^ present Sultan of Muskat as a temporary Muskat, The point is not very material. l,txc -S-,. , . , , i et ■ measure for his subsistence. As you know, ailairs in Kalat were in a continual state of turmoil from a time early in the nineteenth century, and it is not surprising therefore that Gwadur was not recovered, thous-h there seems to have been every intention of doing so on the part of the Khans of Kalat, and expeditions were prepared with this very obiect. The Khan confirms the information which 1 previously sent, that toe Sultan sent a number o£ slaves and gifts to Mir Nasir Khan (II) as a “douceur, apparently to prevent the latter re-entering on possession of the port. There is one statement in the Khan's letter which does not appear to he qmte accurate. I refe- to what he says about the share of the Gichkis m Gwadur being made ovei .o Muskat. Now it is well known that after Nasir Khan (I) had conquered Mekran he made an arrange- m^ wUh the Gichkis, who had previously been the ruling race, that he would leave them half the revenuesand retain mXska!.’ Inmality rSThere^^evidence tot on receiving possession, the Muskat people made an arrangement to pay the Gichkis their half share of the revenues ot the port. _ The total revenue at that time was seven thousand qorash or dollars. Th,s was d.stn- buted as follows Qorash,2 • - ae o.rl should anythin? farther of importance turn Muskat. I am sti^l continuing my enquiries, and should, any a up, I will let you know.

HOHGES.BHLIBR, Esq., C.S., Superintendent, Imperial Gazetteer, Baluchistan. AfUr lomplimnh.-Yo™ letter, dated the 30th April last, has been received. I am very glad you have returned safe-from your long tour. With reference to your query regarding the port of Gwadur, I beg to state as follows . In the reign of my ancestor Mir Nasir Khan the Great, an ancestor of the present Sultan of Muskat took shelter with Mir Nasir Khan as a refugee, and remained m kala , fo ome time. Mir Nasir Khan was a generous man. He g -anted him for his maintenance hm own share in Gwadur and that of the Gicnkis as a temporary measure, i.e. } t il such time as he got possession of Muskat. Shortly after this the Khan died and the terms remained unf ufilled. From the time of Mir Mahmud Khan (I) up to my father Mir Mehrab Khan's time, the case was suspended, but in the days of my brother Mir Nasir Khan, II, Sultan Said sent to my brother 15 negro slaves, 5 female slaves and one sword of superior make with a Barband of gold. f He thought that the place was going back again into the owner’s hands, and therefore sent my brother the above-mentioned presents. At that time my brother had sent Shahghassi Wali Muhammad, who was our Wazir, to Kech and Makran to gain possession of the port of Gwadur. Meanwhile also my brother died, and the matter remained unsettled till I sent my son Mali mud t Khan to Makran. The Sultan then ' ' eprt,3en, au/ e. Hughes-Buliee. became convinced that the territories would go to ’the rightful owner, through the help of the British Government. But the matter fell through again owing to Azad (Khan) Rakhshani and Nauroz (Khan) * * [ r ihe Khan refers to Sir Nauroz Khan, Naushirwani, and to his father. His meaning is not quite clear, but he probably refers to the disturbances caused m Makran by the incursions of the Naushirwanis of Kharan.—R.

We have, however, reason to believe that this prohibition has not always heap ^serv ed, and we have recently found ft necessary to call the Sultan’s attention to the matter, and to advise hi* to dlyeet his representative at awadur to confiscate all arms and ammunition which may te landed on the coastn wi-bMaa Maakat jurisdiction, ily undertook to follow. This advice the Sultan read- 3. In reporting the result of his comunication to the Sultan, our Political Agent at Maskat observed that, EiS :r J2i2» prohibitory proclamation issued by the Suxten in 1891, and his present action in enforcing the prohibition, seemed to be incompatible with the terms of // Article M of the French Treaty withosb Maskat of 1844- “46: but that, as no objection had been raised by the French to the former notification, it appeared unnecess ary to anticipate that any would be raised in the present case. In order to obviate any difficulty which might arise in this connection, we are of opinion that the withdrawal of Gwadur from Maskat control and its inclu sion within the sphere of our predominant influence is very desirable. Signs have not been wanting oi a tend ency on the part of^ oth 3 r^lk^ers -tQ^,taka...an-,.,&gt;intsrfi31 ..ixi Gwadur and its vicinity, and we have authorised Major Cox to Inform the Sultan that the British Government would certainly not permit Gwadur, surrounded as it is by territory under their control, to be in any way associat ed with another Power. This warning may be sufficient to prevent the Sultan from mctoaxim entertaining any such proposal so long as our relations with him remain as friendly as they are at present. But it is conceivable thatthat the Sultan or Ms successor may here^rter prove obligations, and, in any case, should^ 3i ' Ce dsmsr ‘ d t0 Post a representative at Gwadur, the claim might, under present conditions, be difficult to resist, and an embarrassing situation might arise. ^ 4 * Por t,119se reasons we are disposed to make an attempt, through His Highness the Khan of Kalat, to ob- 4 ^ain the cession of 4 Gwadur on reasonable terms* The «£ offer might, we think, be ostensibly made by the Khan on his own behalf| but the price, if the Sultan accepted the offer, would be paid from Indian revenues. We have ascertained from Major Cox that the armmal revenue which the Sultan derives from Gwadur iKxtkacxx is about 22,200 a dollars, while the cost of administration is probably vtiisv Zo . &lt; 5 * # /^{fzro ^ little, if at all, in excess of Bs 1,000 a year.

Gwadur, with a few miles of coast appretaining to it, has been in the possession of the Sultans of Maskat since the end of the 18th century, when it was granted by the Khan of Jfalat to the rebel son of Imaunt.Ahmed of Maskat, on the condition that he should always defend this place against the enemies of Kalat* It is entirely surround** ed by Baluch territory, and since its cession to Maskat more than one unsuccessful attempt has been made by uhe Baluchi to recover it. As Lord Lansdowne is aware, the Sultan of Maskat has bound himself by a formal undertaking, given in the year 1891, not to part with the dominions of Maskat and Oman or any of their dependencies, save to the British Govern ment | but so far as Lord George Hamilton Is aware, no such imdertaking has been given to any ot^er P^wer, ^~iish would give it the right to object to the proposed sale to Kalat. ThereThere remains for consideration the bearing of the Anglo-French Declaration of the loth March m which both Powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Maskat* it appears to Lord George Hamilton that, while tills Declaration might preclude either party to it from ac- CLu-xi ing practical sovereignty over any portion of (Man proper, it in no way precludes a friendly negotiation with His Highness with a view to an arrangement between i/ns him and the Khan of Kalat, by which, it return for a suf* 1 ficient consideration, Gwadur should be restored to its original owner. In connection with this question I am, however, to refer you to the papers forwarded with my covering letter of the 2hih March last. Lord George Hamilton will be glad to be favoured with Lord Lansdowne's views on the proposal of the Govern ment of India, which, unless there is any objection on grounds of general policy, appears to him to desS-DV^- favourable consideration.

It does not appear to Lord Lansdowne that such a transaction would, strictly speaking, be in contravention of the Anglo-French Declaration of 10th March 1862, as that instrument contains only an engagement to respect the independence of the Sultan which cannot be said to be affected by the sale of a small outlying dependency in isolated position on the opposite mainland# It must, however, be expected that the French Government will use all their influence to oppose a tran#~ faction which they will regard, not altogether without reason, as tantamount to the acquisition of thio ter^ i— tory by Graat Britain, and considering the very decided action which was taken by Oreat Britain to prevent the lease to France of a separate coaling depot in the neigh bourhood of Maskat, it appears to Lord Lansdowne that they would have atjleast colourable grounds for their opposition* Lord Lansdowne does not think that it would be judi cious to raise such a question at the present **» Moment, aud he would suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India, whether It might not be possible that the proposal should be of a more limited character, as for instance that the Customs administra tion of Gwadur should be leased to the Khan of Kalat for a term of years in consideration o;finmuniij^ xhe Rigiit Hon # ble Lord Oeorge F # Hairrllton, a.C.S.

Ramsay, C.I.E., Officiating Agentto the Governor- General m Baluchistan, To -The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for tlie consideration of the Government or India, copies or the papers cited in the enclosed list, regarding a request which has been made by it is Highness the Khan of Kalat for the restoration to him of the port of Gwadur, which is now in the possession of the Sultan of Maskat. 2. As the Government of India are aware, Gwadur has hitherto been * Aitebison’s Treaties, Volume n, page regarded, at least from the point of view 50, and Curzon’s Persia, volume n, page 432. 0 f the European historian* as a de pendency of Maskat having been conferred at the close of the 18th century by Nasir Khan, Khan of Kalat, upon Saiyid Sultan, who had fled from Maskat after a dispute with his brother Saiyid Said, the then ruler of Maskat. 8. It would appear, however, from the papers of w r hieh copies are now forw arded, that the statement of the case, which is to he found in Aitchison’s Treaties and in Curzon’s “ Persia,” is not altogether complete, and that, so far from Gwadur having been granted to the Maskat refugee as a free gift in sovereignty, it was bestowed upon him only as a temporary act of grace, and the suzerainty of the Khan of Kalat over the port was recognized by the Sultans of Maskat, at any rate up to the middle of the last century. 4. The Khan’s statement, as contained in his Murasila, dated the 5th September 1903, and supported by the evidence contained in the enclosures of this letter, is to the effect that Gwadur was granted to Saiyid Sultan by Mir ISTasir Khan as Mehmani, i&gt;e., as a sort of maintenance allowance bestow ed upon a refugee seeking an asylum in his territories: that after the return of Saiyid^Sultan to Maskat,'and his reconciliation to his brother, the ruler of Maskat, Gwadur was allowed to remain in Maskat possession on payment of tribute : that this tribute was paid as recently as the time of Aasir K ian II (who died in 1857) and that from the time of the attack upon Kalat by a British force in 1839 until recent years, the rulers of Kalat were too much occupied with the internal affairs of the State to make an effort to recover pos session of the port. . .. 5. In support of the Khan’s contention, there is the following evidence: (а) The statement of Ghulam Hyder, Naib of Kalat and son of Tawa« ‘^ kal, former Kalb of the State, to the effect that his father was originally a resident of Zanzibar and was sent m his youth to Nasir Khan II, as tribute from the Sultan of Maskat xor uwactur Bunder. (б) The statement of Zafaran, a woman of about 70 years o age, a so ^ ’ from Zanzibar, that she was sent to Nasir Khan II by the ru er of Maskat wrk 17 other slaves, of whom tt will he noted that Towakal, the father of the present Naib, was one. /x cfnteraent of Mirza Ghulam Husain Khan, Peshkar of His CJ Highness the Khan of Kalat, whose ancestors were in the service 5 former ralerTof the State.

Written inside the cover is tne name “Henry Green, Political Agent, Baluchistan” and the book presumably belonged to his library. This seems to authenticate (el Extract from an ancient history of the family of the Governor of Kahit, which h&amp;s been obtained by Kazi Jalai*ud-ciin, O. 1* hi.j Political Adviser to His Highness the Khan. (/) Local tradition, as ascertained by the Superintendent of the Census and Gazetteer in Baluchistan, and his subordinates, is clearly in favour of that version of the cession of Gwadur to IVTaskat, which is put forward by the Khan. 6. The evidence which has been obtained constitutes, in rny opinion, a strong primd facie case in support of the Khan contention, .a t is, 1 think, at any rate established that Gwadur was not originnily made over uncondi tionally to Saiyid Sultan, and that the ruler of Maskat, for some considerable period after obtaining possession of the port (probably until the death, of Mir Nasir Khan II in 1857) made presents to the Khan.. Whether these presents can be regarded as having constituted a regular tribute or not, it is difficult to say, but there is a strong presumption that, had the title of the Maskat ruler to the possession of Gvvadur been absolute and unconditional, the annual gift of valuable presents would not have continued for so many years. 7. In the past the history of Kalat has been so stormy that the Khans of Kalat have had little leisure to spend on the affairs of Makran; but as the Government of India are aware steps have of recent years been taken to im prove the administration of Makran, and this no doubt explains the present request of His Highness to be assisted in recovering this portion of his ancient possessions. I have no exact information to show the financial value of Gwadur to the Sultan of Maskat, nor whether he attaches any sentimental value to the place. Prom Colonel Yate’s diary of 6th December 1901, it seems that the only income derived from the port is 22,000 dollars a year, gross income; and that it contains no Arab population other than the W 7 ali ? s escort. 8. Considering the long possession enjoyed by the ruling family of Maskat. the Government of India might not be willing to support very strongly the proposal of His Highness the Khan against the wishes of the Sultan ; but I think that His Highness’s request that Government should take some steps to further his wishes is not unreasonable, and I 5 therefore, submit bis request for favourable consideration. His Highness would no doubt be willing to compen sate the Sultan for any financial loss that be may incur on restoring the port to Kalat, but I have not thought it desirable to consult him on this subject, as it is possible that the Government of India may not consider the present time a favourable one for moving in the matter. The rising importance of Pasm of course tends to depreciate the value of Gwadur. 9.

From accounts of former events I have heard that the Gwadur port belonged to the Kalat State and was ruled over by my ancestors. In the time of Mir Nasir Khan I (Great) a relative of the ruler (Sultan) of Maskat had some quarrel with the ruler and came to Khan Nasir Khan as a refugee. Mir Nasir Khan gave him the Gwadur port as Mehmani and sub sistence allowance. After some time the refugee returned to his own country tMaskat) and was reconciled to the ruler of Maskat. He however, maintained friendly relations with our family and used to send slaves, maid slaves, and other presents yearly. Owing to his friendly relations and sending presents my ancestors were 'pleased not to demand anything more from him.

I have got an old history of Ahmedzais, the present ruling family of Ealat, which, gives a very clear account of Gwadur port. The first and last portion of this history are missing, but the text show s that it was compiled in the time of Masir Khan the Great. The events treated in the book bring the history down to the death of that potentate and this too points to the same conclusion, ^ 2. There is a paragraph in this book in Persian which I give here verbatim. “When there arose a friction between Sultan Said of Maskat and his brothers, the latter got the upper hand and expelled the former from the country. Sultan Said came to Khan Sahib (Nasir Khan) for help. The latter replied that he could not send his army to such a remote country (IVlaskatV but as he (Sultan Said?) had travelled a long distance in coming over to him* for help, he was ready to make over to him the revenues of the Gwadur port Which he would enjoy till he regained possession of his own country.

This remark is of some importance as enabling us to locate dates. It is also to be remembered that Gwadur has acquired importance only since it passed to Maskat, the chief ports previously having been Jiwani and Pasni. (Journal of the Asiatic Society ol iiengal, No. CLIY, dated 1844i 5 page 802.) A glance here at the history of the present Maskat dynasty and also of that of the Giehkis will not be out of place. Ahmad-bin-Said, a man of humble origin, founded tne Al bu Saiad dynasty of ^laskat in 174.-1 and reigned 40 years. It is unanimously accepted in Makran that the Sultans of Maskat are descended from the same Albu Saiad, or Bu~ Saiad as they are locally called, from whom the Buledais of Kech, to whom a reference will presently he made, are descended. The point is of interest as showing the long connection between Makran and Maskat. Ahmad was suc ceeded ^in 1783 by Saiad Said, and it was be against whom Saiad Sultan, his brother, raised a successful revolution after bis sojourn at Gwadur. The exact period of Saiad Sultan’s stay at the latter port is not known, but Boss states that he succeeded in usurping the Sultanate of Maskat in 1797. (Memoran dum on Makran by Captain E. C. Boss, page 38.) As Mir Nasir Khan died in 1793, and it was during Ms reign that Saiad Sultan went to Kalat, it would appear that the latter must have been at Gwadur for at least five years. Saiad Sultan was killed in battle in 1804, and it is un necessary to follow the dynasty farther in this place. It is admitted on all hands in Makran that the Buledais held the reins of power in that country during the 17th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, quarrels arose with the Gichkis. These Gichkis are of Ba jput origin, and had migrated from India into the Panjgur valley some time before. Here they appear to have gained considerable influence chiefly by marriage with the Nowsherwanis. Early in the 18th century one Mulla Murad, a Panjgur Gichki broke away from the main stock and made his way to Kecb, where lie became a member of that curious sect known as the Zikris or Dais. His accession to the Zikri faith appears to have given it a considerable impetus, and he very soon became a man of great power and influence among bis co-religionists 'at the expense of che Buledais, who were also Zikris. He w 7 as succeeded by his son Malik Dinar, also a staunch Zikri. This Sardar’s date can be fixed at approxi- mately 1739, as it was during his time that the invasion of Makran by Nadir Shah’s General, Muhammad Taqui Khan Beglar Begi, took place. Nadir Shah was at that time in Sind. Shortly after, however, a power arose in the shape of Hir Nasir Khan of Kalat, who was a terrible hater of the Zikris, and a staunch defender of the true faith. Sheh Omar, Malik Dinar’s eldest son, who bad protessea Tskm journeyed to Kalat and brought in Mir Nasir Khan (3750- ^ Iter maD y expeditions Malik Dinar was induced to submit to Nasir Khan and was put to a miserable death. Sheh Omar, who succeeded to the chief ship played havoc among the Zikris and put many of them to the sword In consideration ot the assistance which Mir Nasir Khan had given, an arrange* ment was made, by which he became entitled to half the revenues of Kech. Apparently tms arrangement was made in or previous to 1778, as indicated bv a sanaa in possession of one Kaulida Kenagi of Dasht by which a certain sum is made over by Sheh Omar Gichki to one of the Kauhda’s ' mtion of his good services against the Zikri schismatics sanaa confirming the grant, dated 1793. ancestors in recog- There is another * The words used are : ‘‘ Gwadar-ra bah arijat amanati dadah.” - s * i«a.» , ,[Sots.—T he Ute Mir AMal Kuial, M.wJ. of M^U K-7, 7 H h7 1 7“ “ ‘ n “'- eitra ' te ' “““ 8tej ***■-* steb Ondr,went to Kharan and induced Mir Jahangir Nausherwani to join them, and they took refuge with Shah Nasir Khan (the first). In the end the Brahui army did not go to Maskat to help Saiad Sultan, but at length Mir Nasir Khan lent him Gwadur on trust. Mir Nasir Khan said: As soon as Maskat is recovered, make over Gwadur to me (Mir Nasir Khan). He has not given it back up to this time. Translation of Sanad. (Seal not legible.)

Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, Dated Ziarat, the 7th July 1904, In continuation of Major Ramsay's letter Ho, 31, dated the 20th January 1904, regarding the proposed rendition of Gwadar to His Highness the Khan of Kalat, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Xalat, in which he draws attention to a claim put forward hy the Jam of Las Bela to the possession of that port. A copy of a note recorded hy Mr. Hughes-Buller, on the subject of this claim, is also attached. r 2. I concur in the opinion expressed by Major Showers that the Jam's pretentions need not be seriously considered. I have, etc,, Sd/- C. £.

The place was given, he says, to one of his ancestors before being bestowed on the Sultan's brother and that the &amp; ? had no right to part with it. This is a point that can, if thought desirable, be taken up as between Kalat and las Bela should Government ever press Baluchistan claims to the port and obtain its rendition, but as the Jam and his immediate ancestors have not raised this claim before, as Gwadur is situated in Kalati Mekraa and not in las Bela and as Kalat has undoubtedly had recent relatione with iiaskat with regard to the port. It hardly seems that the Jam’s pretentions need be seriously consideredTranslation of a l.lurasila dated the 23rd January 19 C 4 from the Jam of Las Bela to the Political Agent, Kal&amp;t. A. C. I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your Murasila of the January 1904 asking for information about Gwadur and in reply to state tnat this port was formerly nothing but a small collection of huts belonging to His Highness the Khan of Kalat. In the time of Khan Mir Mahmud Khan (grandfather of Mir Mehrab Khan) the Sultan of Maskat*s brother having quarrelled with the Sultan came to His Highness the Khan of Kalat and begged him to give him some means of livelihood, whereupon the Khan was pleased to grant him the income of Gwadur, When this news reached my forefather Jam Mir Khan (son of Ali Kathuria) he wrote to the Khan pointing out the illegality of this grant in as much as the port was not his (the Khan's) to bestow, having already being granted as a marriage dowry to himself (the Jam). His Highness Mir Mahmud Khan died soon after the receipt of this letter and Jam Mir Khan then sent troops for the purpose of capturing Gwadur and this, after a great deal of fighting and bloodshed, was eventually accomplished. ^ The Sultan* s/conquest could reach Bela, Jam Mir Khan died and was succeeded by Jam All Khan. Soon after news was received at Bela that the Sultan of Maskat had attacked Sonmiani the sea and plunderedplundered and burnt it. The Jam (Mir All Khan) at once despatched a large body of troops to Maskat and a Maskat port called Ras-ul- Khemnn was captured. In this fight many lives were lost on both sides, xhis was follQY/ed by the despatch by the Sultan of Maskat of one of his brothers to His Hi^iness Uasir Khan, Khan of Kalat, with a full description of recent events; i. e., the seizure of Gwadur by the Jam, the Sultan’s attack on Sonmiani and lastly the capture of the Ras-ul-Ehezaun port by the Jam and with the request f that the Jam who was his (the Khan’sJ grandson (daughter’s son) might be warned to retire from Uaskat territory. On this the Khan summoned the Jam to Kalat and asked him to restore the port (Gwadur) which had been bestowed by his father to the Sultan’s brother. The Jam in reply said that the port was originally given by his father Mir Mahmud Khan in dowry on the marriage of his (Mahmud 5 s; grand-daughter to his (the Jam’s) father Jam Mir Khan the 1st and that it could not therefore be given to the Sultan’s brother. The controversy caused ill-feeling between the Khan and the Jam and the latter then returned to Bela. A short time after both Khan Kasir Khan and Jam All Khan died. Jam Mir Khan, my grandfather was then only 6 years old and the administration of the state fell into the fcands of hi s mother Bibi ilaud. The people of the country were not pleased with the xady's assumption of power and they became rebellious. She was obliged therefore to sumon her troops back from Gwadur and Ras-ul-Xhemun to help her. Some of the troops remained behind in Gwadur andA ■gWJ'L-UlLB rias-ul-iaeanm, and their deeendants are there to this day having branched off into various tribes such as Jamot, Sheikh, Runjha, ShahUii, Angona, Barfat, Bur a, Handora, and Sogra etc. in jaabaz a town of Uaskat, there is the tosih of Sheikh Humar one of the big ancestors of the Huaran Sheikh tribe. 2he facts above stated I have repeatedly heard from my father and grandfather. I have also written to Ormara and if any useful information is obtained there a further oommunioation will be sent you. With usual endings. F. A. As I understand the Jam’s allegation, which is very involved, it is alleged that Gwadur was given in dower to Jam Mir Khan, I, when he married 3ibl Sultan lOiatun daughter of Haair Khan the Great, and widow of Jam Ghulam Shah. In order to make matters clearer I append a statement showing a list of the Aliani family who have ruled in the Las Bela State and the contem porary Khans. That Jam Mir Khan, I* married Bibi Sultan Khatun is corroborated by Tate in 'The Ahmadzai Khan* of Kalat' but the writer there states that Hasir Khan the Great, only gave him half the revenues of Bela in dower. He says ebcut Swadur. yam Mir Ehan, I. ascended the 'gadi' in 1776. and presumably he .•narried his brother's widow, the daughter of Kasir Hhan the Great not long afterwards. It was only about that time that Gwadur oame intointo the hands of Haair Khan. The Jam does not indicate whether actual possession was taken of Gwadur by his ancestor* nor is any corroboration of his statement to be obtained in Mekran. Shortly afterwards we know that it fell into the hands of Maskat as I have previously shown. If the facts alleged by the Jam are correct it mast have 'been between the years 1816 and 1818 that the question of the right to Grwadur was raised by Jam Mir Khan X, for it is stated that Mir Mahmud Khan died about the time of the receipt of the letter from Jam Mir Khan, I, which raised the question, whilst Jam Mit* Khan I, died before receiving the news of the capture of Gwadur by his troops. This was in 1818. If the rulers of Bela got possession of Gwadur therefore, they must have held it from about 1818 to 1830, when Jam Mir Khan II, succeeded to the throne under the guardianship of his mother Bibi Bur Iltazai. (Bibi Baud seems to be a mistranslation). From about 1830 onwards it has admittedly not been in possession of the jam* s of Bela. Had the possession of Gwadur by Maskat been at any time interrupted it is a curious thing that Haji Abdul Babi should not have referred to the fact when he visited Gwadur I faS ao^ClIV-lSM*^’ j 1838-39 and that the Giehkis. who were entitled to half the revenues, should know nothing about it. 2he incident of the capture of Uiani by the Joasrax pirates occured in I 808 according to Bombay Records So. KVII page 308 and the Jam seems to be wrong in placing the event after the a ilege&amp;alleged capture of Gwa&amp;ur. The Joasmi pirates had nothing to do with the Sultan of Maskat so far as X am aware. If I am correct in what I have said above, the point of historical interest is whether Bela held Gwadur for about IE years from 1818 to 1830• On this point I have had very careful enquiries made and not a single person is to be found Who corrobo rates the Jam’s statement or who has ever heard of the possession of Gwadur by the Jadgals fas the Las Bela people are known) either before or after it fell into the possession of Maskat. So far as any legal claim to Gwadur goes I agree with Major Showers that the Jam’s pretentions need not be seriously considered. In February 1903 I corresponded with Khudadad Khan the Ex-Khan of Kalat about Ormara and the facts alleged by the Jam about Gwadur have a very curious resemblance to the facts alleged by Khudadad Khan about Ormaral 1 place a copy of the translation of that letter with this note. It seems to me that the Jam's claim to Swadur is based on facts relating to Ormnral .R.
