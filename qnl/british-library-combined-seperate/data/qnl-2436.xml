The office notes at the end of the file (folios 50-54) mirror the chronological arrangement.Some items in the file are annotated in pencil with page numbers which refer to other items in the file, as marked with the file’s original pagination/foliation system using red and blue pencil numbers, also referred to in the office notes.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence starts on the front cover and finishes on the inside back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio (except for ff. 10A-10C, which are on the verso side). The following foliation anomalies occur: 1 and 1A; 10, 10A, 10B, 10C.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file’s correspondence, papers and other items relate to unauthorised flights and emergency landings in Saudi territory by British aircraft. The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain, the Political Agent in Kuwait (these two posts being held by a number of incumbents during the period covered), and representatives of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company [CASOC].Most of the file’s correspondence relates to two specific incidents. The first, taking place in January 1942, involved the forced landing of an Royal Air Force (RAF) Blenheim aircraft at El Khabur or Al Khobar [Al Khubar] in Saudi Arabia, and the subsequent presentation by British officials to the Shaikh of Al Khubar of a silver tray, in recognition of the assistance given by him and his people. Photographs of the tray and its inscription are found on folios 10A-10C. A second incident, involving the emergency landing of three RAF Hurricanes in salt marshes at Ras es Safaniyah [Safaniyah] in April 1942, led to negotiations with Ibn Saud, and subsequent efforts by the Political Agent in Kuwait and CASOC representatives to first retrieve the pilots and then salvage the planes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Air accidents</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000091#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000091#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
