In the absence of detailed ioformation, it is difficult to form an opinion as to any justification there may be for the action of the Sheikh^ Agent.

Mr. Brodrick would be glad to be favoured with Lord Lansdowne's opinion whether, on the facts reported, he sees any objection to the instruc tions eiven by the Government of India to the Commander of H.

From— M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In *0 the first portion of your telegram, dated Poreign with Viceroy, 1st December 1904, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, copies of two communications since received from His Britannic Majesty s Consul at Bussorah, on the subject of the recent Fao incident. 2. Mr. JVIonahan's first communication, his Despatch No. 59 of 8th December to His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Constantinople, for- warded such information as he had been able to obtain locally at Bussorah, and not unnaturally presented what seems to have been an essentially Turkish settin^ of the incident. That version however is now considerably modified by the information conveyed in his second communication, dated 2dth January 1905, as the result of special inquiries made on the spot by a trustworthy Agent, and* we now have a very much more probable explanation of what happened. 3. It will be noted that Mr. Monahan states categorically that the murdered man Hamed bin Aleyweh, was not one of Skaikh Mubarak's Fellahs. On the other hand Captain Knox stated with no less confidence that he was a gardener in the Shaikh's employ and the fact of his being in the garden near the Agent's quarters at an early hour of the morning: skives some support to the latter view; but be that as it may, it is at all events clear from Consul Monahan's last report that the Turkish Corporal of Gendarmes fired at and killed the man with unjustifiable recklessness which resulted also in the death of an unoffending and apparently pregnant woman at the same time. 4. The Turkish susrgestion to which at first some credence was given by Mr. Townley and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, to the effect that the Shaikh's Agent had himself committed the murder, a contingency which always seemed inconsistent with the established features of the incident, would now appear to be altogether baseless, and the action of the Agent in arresting the Gendarmes, wbo to him must have appeared to have just been guilty of the wanton murder of two harmless persons, now appears, by the light of the last report, to have been a prompt and justifiable proceeding. If correct, moreover, it would account for the accommodating readiness of the Turkish Authorities to look upon the incident as closed. 6. It remains to be considered what if any further action is called for on our part. In this connection I gather from Captain Knox's letter No. 61 of which a copy was submitted with this office letter No. 390 of 19th November that Shaikh Mubarak also is disposed to drop the matter. In any case it is clear that Shaikh Mubarak J s allegation that date produce was destroyed to the value of Bs. 23,120 receives no corroboration. At the same time there is no doubt that Mubarak is chronically apprehen sive as to the safety of his property at Fao and as to the tendency of the Turks to oppress him through the instrumentality of them, and the present report of Consul Monahan seems to afford material for a useful grievance on the strength of which we could take up the cudgels for the Shaikh of Koweit should he press us further in this particular matter or should we at anytime need a ready pretext for assisting Mubarak to resist pressure applied to him by the Bussorah authorities. 6. I must leave it to the Government of India to decide whether it would or would not be advisable now to draw the attention of His Majesty's Ambassador to Mr. Monahan's last report with a view to his addressings note of remonstrance to the Porte before the incident passes into oblivion. I myself venture to think that nothing would be lost by the pursuit of that course. No. 59, dated the 8th December 1904. From The Acting British Coneul, i^ussorah, To—His Majesty's Charge d'Affairee, Constantinople. With reference to my telegram No. 65 of the 14th ultimo, I have the honour to state that I have still but little to add to the information given therein and in my previous reports on the Fao incident.2 The Acting Wali Pakhri Pasha showed most praiseworthy energy in send- i no . Gendarmes ^in pursuit of robbers of whom, during his actingship, at least two were killed while many were imprisoned. On the 1 Oth of last October three Gendarmes in pursuit of a robber entered the Fao property of Shaikh Mubarak. They got into collision with a crowd of his Fellah tenants, shots were fired j Shaikh Mubarak's Agent came on the scene ; the gendarmes were over powered, and the Agent took them off prisoners alongside of H. M. S. Merlin with the dead bodies of the man and his wife as I have already reported. Pakhri Pasha officially thanked the Commander of the Merlin for refusing to take the gendarmes on board and handing them over to the Kaimmacam of Pao. Pakhri Pasha told me that as the result of his inquiries he believed that the Agent had himself killed the man and the woman who were his enemies, and that the man, a fellah on Mubarak's estate, was on the 10th of October shut up in eontinernent in the Agent's house in which durance the Agent had placed him. Pakhri Pasha whether he fully believed this or not was certainly ex asperated by the conduct of the agent who, he truly said, was a drunkard, in carrying off the gendarmes in this way to a foreign man-of-war. His Excellency said he was determined to arrest him if he remained in Pan. Eight of the Pao fellahs were with little delay arrested and imprisoned. Mubarak wrote to the Nakib the religious Chief of the Sunni Musalmans of Bussorah expressing regret for the agent's conduct and promising to recall and punish him, and perhaps wrote to the Acting Wali also in the same sense. I too in ray several secret messages urged the agent to go away from Pao, and at last on or about the 24th October he did go to the Persian side of the river; whether he ever went to Koweit I am still uncertain. It would in any case be unnecessary for him to remain in Pao after the close of the date season which so far as Mubarak's property is concerned ends in October. The Act ing Wali promptly released six of the eight men and told me that the incident was closed. He gave me a new version of the death of the woman, namely, that she died in childbirth and the agent shot through her head after death. This is of course possible. The agent stated to Captain Knox that the woman was pregnant and that she and her prematurely born child were killed. This statement seems to me obscure and a medical report from the Merlin's Surgeon, if one has been made may explain the matter. The Surgeon, so far as I know, only stated that the man, woman were both shot through the head, and said nothing about a child. With regard to Shaikh Mubarak's Pao property, I may mention that I received in August and in the early part of September several complaints both directly from Mubarak and through the Resident at Bushire of oppressive conduct of the Caimmacam in arresting Mubarak's watchmen and fellahs, in preventing the fellahs from coming to an agreement with his agent about the quantity of dates to be levied this year as rent, and in preventing the construction of a breakwater on the plea that it was encroaching on the Pao fortress. The Wali gave the desired orders which were however only partially obeyed. On the 10th September the Caimmacam was removed from his post, and has since been given the new post of Hillah in Baghdad vilayet. Since the Caimmacam's departure, I have heard no more of such grievances. I imagine that the Acting Caimmacam who is notoriously venal has come to an arrangement witli Shaikh Mubarak. The latter has now I hear, complained that his men are leaving Pao in alarm. His watchmen would in any case have left at the close of the date season; and I do not believe that any important number of his fellahs have left. The fellahs would seem to have no cause for fear now. No. 1, dated the 20th January 1905. From Mr. Monahan , Acting His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bussorah, To Major P, Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your despatch No. 1500 of the 18th ultimo, respecting Shaikh Mubarak's complaints of persecution by the Turkish authorities, I have the honour to state that I have this week sent to Pao to make inquiries a person in whom I have confidence and that the following is the result. Early in last October the Acting Wali of JBasrah wrote to the Acting Caimmscarn of iao that Amir a well known robber and his followers should be taken dead or alive. The Acting Caimmacam sent a Corporal of Gendarmes witu three gendarmes and a soldier. When passing through Mubarak 's dateit? groves they saw two ihbii and asked them who they were. One of them ^ave his name. The other ran away, thus giving reason to believe that he was a robber. The Corporal fired and killed him, and the bullet went into the head of a woman who was standing near. She had in her arms a child who fell to the ground but who does not appear to have died. The woman was probably killed outright, though there is some testimony which has an air of seriousness, but which I am not inclined to take seriously, to the effect that she was not killed at all. The killed man was a Persian, not one of Mubarak's fellahs. The woman was not his wife. One of the Zapties ran away and gave information to the Local Government. The three others were taken captive through the efforts of Mubarak's Agent who now appeared on the scene and who afterwards gave an inaccurate account of the incident. What became of the soldier i does not appear. Eight of Mubarak's fellahs were afterwards imprisoned by the Acting Wali, but have been since released. Some of the fellahs ran away from Eao, but in a few days they returned. The fellahs have not otherwise suffered and Mubarak's property has not suffered at all. My informer spoke with many of the fellahs, and they agree with his other informant that there was no such robbery of Mubarak's dates as he alleges. G. L C. P 0.- Ko. 4646 F. 0.-13 -24005.-67.-L. G.

The Vali has been instructed to despatch to the spot two high Government officials, the one belonging to the Civil Administration, and the other to the Gendarmerie Corps, with the object of opening an inquiry on the facts referred to. Whilst the Turkish Government is prepared to do what is incumbent upon them, the Vali has been instructed to put himself in communication with the British Consul, and to require him to abstain from intervening in such purely internal matters. The Grand Vizier states also that this matter has been considered by the Council of Ministers, whose decision was submitted to, and sanctioned by, His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. In obedience to the Imperial command, the Minister for Foreign Affairs now brings the above to the notice of His Majesty's Embassy, so that the necessary 0 instructions may be sent to the British Consul at Bussorah.

Vice-Consul Monihan to Mr. Townley .—(Received at Foreign Office, 31st December.) Bussorah, 8th December 1904 (No. 59.) S ir, jjjlDOff' With reference to my telegram No. 65 of the 14th ultimo, I have the honour to state that I have still but little to add to the information given therein and in previous reports on the Pao incident. The Acting Vali, Fakhri Pasha, showed most praiseworthy energy in sending gendarmes in pursuit of robbers, of whom, during his actingship, at least two were killed, while many were imprisoned. On the luth of last October three gendarmes in pursuit of a robber entered the Pao property of Sheikh Mubarek. They got into collision with a crowd of his fellah tenants; shots were fired; Sheikh Mubarek's agent came on the scene; the gendarmes were overpowered, and the agent took them off prisoners alongside of His Majesty's ship Merlin, as I have already reported. Fakhri Pasha officially thanked the Commander of the Merlin for refusing to take the gendarmes on board, and for handing them over to the Kaimakam of Fao. The Pasha told me that, as the result of inquiries, he believed that the agent had himself killed the man and woman, a married couple, who were his enemies, and that the man, a fellah on Mubarek's estate, was, on the 10th October, being detained in confinement in the agent's house, in which durance the agent had placed him. The Pasha, whether he fully believed this or not, was certainly exasperated by the conduct of the agent, who, be truly said, was a drunkard, in carrying off the gendarmes in this way to a foreign man-of-war, and said he was determined to arrest him if he remained in Fao. Eight of the Fao fellahs were, with little delay, arrested and imprisoned. Mubarek wrote to the Nakib, the religious Chief of the STjmri Mussulmans of Bussorah, expressing regret for the agent's conduct, and promising to recall and punish him, and perhaps wrote to the Vali also in the same sense. I, too, by secret messages, urged the agent to go away from Fao, and at last, on or about the 24th October, he did go to the Persian side of the river; whether he ever went to Koweit I am still uncertain. It would, at any rate, be unneces sary for him to remain in Fao after the close of the date season, which, so far as Mubarek's property is concerned, ends in October. The Pasha promptly relieved six of the eight men, and told me that the incident was closed. He gave me a new version of the death of the woman, namely, that she died in child-birth, and the agent put a shot through her head after death. This is, of course, possible. The agent stated to Captain Knox that she and her prematurely-born child were killed. This statement seems to me obscure, and a medical report from the Merliris surgeon, if one has been made, may explain it. The surgeon, so far as I know, only stated that the man and woman were both killed by shots through the head, and said nothing about a child. 'With regard to Mubarek's Fao property, I may mention that I received in August and in the early part of September, several complaints, both directly from Mubarek and through the Eesident at Bushire, of oppressive conduct of36 the Kaimakam of Pao in arresting Mubarek's watclimen and fellahs, in preventing the fellahs from coming to an agreement with his agent about the quantity of dates to be levied this year as rent, and in preventing the cons truction of a breakwater, on the plea that it encroached on the Fao fortress. The Vali gave the desired orders, which were, however, imperfectly obeyed by the Kaimakam. On the 10th September the latter was removed from his post, and he has since been given the new post of Hillah, in Bagdad vilayet. Since the Kaimakam's departure I have heard no more of such grievances, I imagine that the Acting Kaimakam, who is notoriously venal, has come to an arrangement with Mubarek. The latter has now, I hear, complained that his men are leaving Eao in alarm. His watchmen would in any case have left at the close of the date season, and I do not believe that any important number of his fellahs have left. The fellahs would seem to have no cause for fear now. I have, etc., J, H. MONAHAN. Q. 1. C. P.O.—No. 4421 F. d .-7-2 1905.-10.—W.
