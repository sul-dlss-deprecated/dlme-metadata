On the bottom-right corner of the page two diagonal red lines were drawn, creating a triangle with the frame. In that triangle the total sum of the pages was written: 39 pages in total. As the recto is marked as page number 39 at the top left corner of the page, this is the last page of the composition, and indeed the writing at the last lines is narrowing down, decorated by three red dots arranged in a triangular shape; the sentences, narrowing down to the end of the triangular, state that the text has come to an end, and asking God's help, with blessings for Muhammad and his companions. Another parallel triangular must have been at the bottom-left corner, but that corner is torn.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:type>Manuscripts</dc:type><dc:title>Moral guide for the student</dc:title></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
