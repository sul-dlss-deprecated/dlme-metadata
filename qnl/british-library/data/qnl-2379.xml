Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 15.) (No. 130.) My Lord, Jedda, June 26. 1938. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the activity in aviation which I reported in my despatch No. 107, dated the 30th May, has died down even sooner than I expected. Aeroplanes have been seen very rarely since then, and in the last fortnight I do not think more than one ascent has been made. I am informed that there is no petrol. As you are aware, in Saudi Arabia finance and defence are in the hands of the same official, Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, and this arrange ment, which might lead to extravagance in defence in a richer country, leads to parsimony here, where the Treasury is always short of funds. It is perhaps not unfair to connect the shortage of petrol with the fact that Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman has just despatched to India at the expense of the State a man whose business it is to buy stuffs for the Royal ladies. But it is confidently asserted that next year Saudi Arabia will have its own petrol. 2. According to M. Naidyonoff. the attempts of Major Ciccu to instruct the Saudi pilots in navigation have been abandoned, and the pilots, while able to make straight flights quite well, still show no interest whatever in the theoretical side of their work, or in the engines. 3. The repairs to the second Wapiti are now nearly complete, and M. Naidyonoff is besieging the Minister of Finance, who is at present in Jedda. for enough petrol to enable him to make a trial flight. M. Naidyonoff proposes, as soon as he has two Wapitis at his disposal, to fly to Taif to repair the Wapiti which is lying there. As to the fourth machine, he thinks it may have to be sent to the factory in England, as it was completely dismantled by one of his predecessors. M. Naidyonoff hears much gossip about the desire of the Italians to supply the Saudi Government with machines (? Ansaldo) to oust the Wapitis, but nothing definite. ^ £ 4. There has been talk lately about sending some young Saudis abroad for training in connexion with aviation, and the most definite report is that ten are required for training as air mechanics and ten as motor-car mechanics. This suggested that the Saudi authorities were perhaps proposing to act upon the offe 1 of 'the Air Ministry and had arranged the details, as was suggested in Foreign Office telegram No.' 1 of the 3rd Januar y, through their representative in Cairo. I therefore asked the Kaimakam casually whether the Saudi Government were carrying out the scheme which they had accepted in principle some six months ao-o. The Kaimakam professed to know nothing about the matter, but said he would ask. That was a fortnight ago, and I have not yet received a reply. Perhaps His Majesty’s Embassy in Cairo have some information on this point. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine at Jerusalem. . D I have, &amp;c. R. W.

[E 3627/193/25] CONFIDENTIAL. 4/5/ i’ 93 G Section 2. Copy No. 1 Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—[Received June 20.) (No. 107.) My Lord, Jedda, May 30. 1938. IN my despatch No. 75, which 1 had the honour to address to you on the 21st April, I mentioned in the fourth paragraph that a flight of Saudi aeroplanes to Wejh, which had been contemplated for some time, had been abandoned. The project was revived, however, under the stimulus of the more generous budget for the new year, and eventually a flight to Yanbu, though not to Wejh, was effected. I understand that the flight might have been prolonged to W ejh, only the landing ground there was not ready. Yanbu is about 175 miles from Jedda in a straight line, measured on the map. and roughlv half as far as Wejh. 2. Four machines took part in the flight. M. Naidyonoft piloted the Bellanca, and Major Ciccu was in one of the Capronis with one of the Saudi pilots. Two other Capronis were left to the entire charge of four Saudi pilots. According to M. Naidyonoff all five Saudis took a hand at piloting, and the take-off and landing were quite well done. Thus the Saudi Government now have five pilots who can follow the coast to Yanbu and land without harm. A sixth pilot, Abdullah-al-Mandili, who is as good as any of the others, was not on this flight, having decided to go to Egypt to train for civil aviation. 3. The time of the flight is given in the press as two hours and ten minutes going and two hours and a few minutes for the return journey. The press puts the speed of the Capronis at 160 kilom. (100 miles) per hour, M. Naidyonoff at 150 kilom. Judging by the map I conclude the lower figure to be the more probable. 4. It would appear that the Saudi policy of trying to weary the Italian air mission out by neglect has recently changed to some extent. Interesting evidence of this is afforded by two notices of the flight to Yanbu which appeared in the same newspaper, the Saut-al-Hijaz. a week apart. The earlier report stated that the first machine carried the Russian pilot, the second “ an instructor and three engineers.” Thus, as on an earlier occasion reported a few months ago. the Italian nationality of the instructor was suppressed. A week later the Saut-al-Hijaz says: “There was missing from that account the name of the Italian instructor who led the flight of aeroplanes and supervised the journey.” It describes “ the Italian technical trainer. Signor Ciccu ” as giving the signal to start, mentions the Italian “ engineers ” {i.e., mechanics), and puts the Russian aviator last. It even transfers the Commandant and Officer Commanding Aviation, Said-al-Hurdi, from the Bellanca, in which he travelled with the Russian pilot, to Major Ciccii’s Caproni. 5. This later report bears out information which I had received from M. Naidyonoff. to the effect that Major Ciccu was making determined efforts, supported by the commandant, Said-al-Hurdi, to increase his influence. He did not succeed in obtaining executive powers, as he wished to do, but he secured the new French monoplane as an addition to his “ flight.” There are now, in theory, two flights :— (1) Major Ciccii— 3 Capronis. 2 Italian instructional machines. 1 new Caudron-Renault. (2) M. Naidyonoff. 1 Bellanca. 1 old Caudron-Renault. 4.Wapitis (one completely repaired, one nearly ready, and two much out of order). [330 u—2 J2 F.ach af the two foreign instructors has thus six machines in his charge, and the balance in favour of Major Ciccii. all of whose machines are in working order, is redressed to some extent by the fact that he refuses to fly the new Caudron- Renault, which he professes to regard as difficult and even dangerous, and that M. Naidyonoff has been using it to train some of the Saudi pilots. 6. It is said that Major Ciccu has recently made an attempt to teach navigation to a class of Saudi pilots that began with five, but fell almost immediately to two. The task of imparting any theoretical training to these pilots is made almost impossible by their lack of mathematical and other education and of the practice of mental concentration, but the fact that some of them attend a class conducted by Major Ciccu shows that the boycott of the Italian mission has ceased. 7. The change in the attitude of the Saudi authorities towards the Italian mission affords an interesting subject of speculation. I think there is no doubt that until recently Ibn Sand regarded the Italians with suspicion and wished to prevent their getting a hold of any kind in his country. It may be that the Anglo- j Italian Agreement, by removing Ibn Sand’s fear of Italy, has tempted him to | put some of his eggs into Mussolini's basket—a policy which may have been j encouraged by the recent course of events in Europe. And perhaps he has begun J at last to despair of inducing His Majesty’s Government to modify their Palestine f policy. 8. The press state that the flight to Yanbu is only the prelude to a series of flights to other coast towns, for the purpose of training Saudi pilots for flights ' in the heart of the kingdom and its parts.” There has been greater activity in the air during the last few weeks than at any time since the Italian air mission arrived, but it is the beginning of the financial year, and it is unlikely that petrol will be provided later in the year with the relative liberality with which it is supplied now. Whether the Italian Government can properly continue to provide an air mission at their expense if the Anglo-Italian Agreement comes into force is a matter of interpretation. To provide an officer and about eight mechanics, all drawing overseas allowances, and to change the mechanics every six months or so, must cost the Italian Government a considerable sum, and, as I have suggested before, it is for consideration whether the effect of this arrangement is not the acquisition of a privileged position of a political character. On the other hand, what of the rights which the Iraqi Government wish to be free to exercise under the 1 reaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance, not to mention a suggestion that has recently been made, that the activities of the British Council 'should be extended to Saudi Arabia ? 9.

X 1 745 A ■Si.. a&gt; Lord Castle Stewart cailbd upon irtC by .appointment on | :.'d£/’.P ~~ J August 5th bringing with him Mr. K. 3. Twitchell the American who is managing the affairs of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited. I had understood that Mr. Twitchell had certain definite information which he wanted an opportunity of giving us but when the interview started it appeared that he was simply prepared to answer any question which I liked to ask him about general conditions in Saudi-Arabia. We had a certain amount of desultory conversation about the progress which the Mining Syndicate was making but, beyond the fact that the Syndicate found all the Saudi-Arabian authorities well disposed, with the possible exception of Yusuf Yasin, and that, ap^rt from a regrettable tendency on the part of the local population to put boulders in the paths of motor cars, they had no jjarticular difficulties, nothing much emerged. The Syndicate are apparently well satisfied with their progress and hope the mining will prove valuable. It soon became apparent that what Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. Twitchell really wanted to talk about was Italian influence in Saudi-Arabia. They were both rather disturbed by the efforts which the Italian Minister was making to impress the Saudi Government and by the possible consequences of the recent gift of aeroplanes from the Italian Government to the Saudi Government. Mr. Twitchell volunteered the opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians and were not likely to facilitate the task of Italian penetration but he evidently thought that in practice it might be difficult to resist such penetration. In his view the United States and Great Britain were the only countries whom the Saudis were likely to trust. The United States though quite interested in the operations of American companies in Saudi-Arabia were not likely to take any active steps and he ...I&amp; &amp; he for his part would like to see His Majesty's Government increasing their own influence in Saudi-Arabia. Both he and Lord Castle Stewart agreed that it probably would not do to give any appearance of running after the Saudis and they disclaimed any suggestion that His Majesty's Government should enter into competition with the Italians and the French in presenting aeroplanes to the Saudis. What they were really afraid of I think was that the Italians might at some future stage try to get hold of the landing grounds which the Saudi- Arabian Mining Syndicate is making for its own use within its concession area. They suggested that it would be well worth while for His Majesty's Government to consider whether the Saudis could not be attracted to this country more by an offer of facilities for training air pilots in the United Kingdom. I said that I thought there might be difficulties about this as His Majesty's Government's own hands were pretty full at present with air force expansion. However, I said that we would certainly consider whether anything on the lines suggested was feasible. Lord Castle Stewart said that the company had met with a certain amount of difficulty from the health point of view. a number of their employees had suffered from undefined illnesses and one or two had died. The company were therefore taking steps to engage the services of an expert from the London School of Tropical Medicine to make a special stady which would last for some months. They would propose to present the results of this study to the Saudi Government and it occurred to Lord Castle Stewart that one way of extending our influence would be in the field of medicine in Saudi Arabia. He seemed to have some idea of estaolishing a permanent medical adviser to the company who would also give the benefit of his advice to the • • •the Saudi authorities. I said that the idea of communicating to the Saudi Government the results of any expert investigation vhich the company might undertake seemed to me a useful one. As to the establishment of any permanent medical advisers I advised Lord Castle Stewart to keep in the closest touch with His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda in view of the difficulties which the Saudis seemed inclined to place in the way of foreign practitioners at the moment. I advised him to look very closely into the regulations which had recently been issued in regard to medical practitioners and foreign dispensaries and to make quite sure of keeping within the law of such regulations. (Signed) J. C. Sterndale Bennett. 10th August 1936.British Legation, Jedda. 12th September, 1936. I have the honour to refer to your printed despatch No.215 of the 20th August transmitting the record of Mr. Sterndale-Bennett’s interview with Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. K. 3. Twitchell of the 5th August, and in accordance with your instructions to furnish my observations on the various questions touched on during the conversation. 2. It is interesting to observe that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s London officials were apparently well-satisfied with the progress made so far in this country and that they had hitherto encountered no serious difficulties. The claim that the prospects at Wejh are encouraging is made here with some confidence, but as regards the Mahd ad Dhahab I have for some time derived the impression from certain members of the Syndicate’s personnel that the future of these workings depends entirely on whether an adequate water supply can be assured. That the London Board regard the question as one of great importance would appear from the fact that since I reported on this subject in my despatch No.225 of the 28th July last, they have sent out, at this somewhat unpleasant season of the year, two water specialists of different qualifications, one a Swedish geo-physicist (at a salary of £.300 a month) and the other a British water- diviner. The latter has now left again for the United Kingdom ... The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc. COPY (E 6289/4552/25) No.267. (1662/83/26) Sir,Kingdom and I have recently heard that both experts have pronounced unfavourably on the prospects of finding water at the Mahd. This, if true (for it is as yet unconfirmed), might well dissipate dreams of an Eldorado in that particular area. 3. As regard Italian influence in Saudi Arabia, Mr. ivitchell s opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians is of considerable interest. For my own part, I am impressed by the volume and unanimity of reports current in Jedda that the Italian Legation here is au mieux ith the Saudi authorities, as I have reported in my despatch ho.259 of the 5th September, but I am unable to dismiss from my mind the impression created by Sheykh Yusuf Ya^in, only two months ago, when he spoke to me, with a sincerity I found difficult to question, of his Government’s resolve not to grant the oil concession for the Farsan Islands to the Italians. The Saudi Government at that time resisted the pressure that was brought to bear on them here by the Italian Minister, a resistance which might well have caused them some embarrassment as they had not long before accepted at the hands of the Italians, the gift of three aeroplanus. Perhaps the fact that, as far as I am aware, the remaining three aeroplanes have not yet arrived, may be attributed to Italian disappointment over the oil concession. I therefore am inclined to share Mr.Twitchell’s opinion. I would certainly agree with the view that it 'Ould he impolitic to enter into any competition with the Italians for the favours of King Abdul Aziz, either in the c.upp!y of aeroplanes gratis or in the training of Saudi pilots.4. It is somewhat difficult to express an opinion on the fears of the Syndicate that Italians might at some future stage attempt to get hold of their landing-grounds. These, I understand, are now fairly numerous and have been established at Jedda, Mahd ad Dhahab, Vejh, Yanbu, Dhiba and Taif, by special arrangement with the Saudi Government from 'whom the^r are leased. It does not appear that at Jedda, at least, there is any such menace, for the Saudi authorities, with, it is believed, Italian advice, are now engaged in laying out a large landing ground north-east of uedda, in the vicinity of the Government’s Kandara villa, which, reports say, is also to be brought into use for the pilots and other personnel. if it is true, as reported in Jedda Report for June, paragraph 207, that the establishment of a chain of landing-grounds across Saudi Arabia is in contemplation (and in t:iis connection it will be recollected that last year Ibn Saud was reported to be considering a postal service by air across his kingdom, upon the return of his pilots from Italy), this would not seem to threaten the Syndicate’s landing grounds in such centres as bejh, Yanbu and Ohiba. Their ground at Taif, moreover, is distinct from that of the Government at that place. o. ihe foreign personnel of the Syndicate have had an unfortunate record of ill-health since the commencement of operations. I am reporting by this bag by my despatch No.264 of the 10th September the death of Mr. \«. D. Thomas Lieut. Royal Navy (Ret.) from the effects of heat, whilst on his way to the Mahd. I Jr ve been informed here that thethe prevalence of sickness has been giving the London .^off-ce much concern, and. I understand that considerable expenditure has already been incurred in medical fees, &amp;c. The Syndicate already maintain a full time medical officer, an Indian, at the liahd, but elsev/here they are at present dependent on local resources. These are more or less non existent at ..ejh, where they have a foreign personnel of about twelve, and are exiguous in Jedua, where there are two or three doctors attached tc foreign missions. I had heard, 'merefere, that the Syndicate had arranged to send out a Colo Liackie of the Ross Institute of Tropical Medicine in order to study health conditions at Jedda, Taif, Vejh and the Hahd. Pie has not yet arrived here. 6, l fully agree with the suggestion to present the results of any such investigation to the Saudi Government, although I fear that the present Director-General of Public Health would regard himself as too conversant with the conditions in this country to pay much attention to outside advice. i also agree with Mr. Sterndale-Bennett 1 s cautionary suggestion that the Syndicate should look very closely into Saudi regulations before committing themselves to maintaining a permanent medical staff here. But I feel that the idea is to be recommended, both from the Syndicate’s own point of view, and for the more general reasons mentioned by Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. Twitchcll. The Italians, again, are reported to have in view the establishment of an up-to-date dispensary here and the Italian Legation doctor, who is now away in Italy, is credited 'with the intention of bringing staff and material backoack to Jedda v;ith hini. Hero, however, there would be ^less of the element of competition as between a commercial company/’ and a Legation, than there would be in the case of the gift of aeroplanes. Moreover, there would be less opposition, I believe, on the part of the Saudi authorities to a non-Government dispensary or medical institution of the sort than to those conducted in this country under the auspices of foreign governments. There would, too, be no question of their operations extending to Mecca. I should, therefore, on the whole be favourably disposed towards a proposal of this nature, vie., the establishment of a permanent medical staff here, more particularly as Jedda is badly off in its resources for medical treatment at present, and may be even more so before long, with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. bringing a new influx of Europeans to this country.

IN my telegram No. 63 of the 13th May, I had the honour to submit a summary of the account given me by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin of the visit of my Italian colleague to Ibn Saud’s camp at Ashaira on the 10th May and of what passed between M. Persico and the King. I do not think it necessary to send you a full record of my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf, but I may supplement my telegram by mentioning three points of some importance which I omitted from it, as follows :— {a) My Italian colleague, according to Sheikh Tusuf, began his statement to the King by thanking him for having observed neutrality in the Italo- Abyssinian war and for not having taken part in sanctions. The King replied that he had adopted his attitude for the sake of friendship with all concerned. {b) M. Persico stressed the friendly dispositions of his Government towards the Arab nations and their readiness to give any required assurances in this respect. (c) At the end of the private conversation, in which the sheikh engaged me after he had carried out his instructions to inform me of what had passed at Ashaira, he threw out a question regarding reports that His Majesty’s Government might withdraw from the League of Nations and regarding the consequences of such a step, if it were taken. 2 3 4 2. I did not comment on {a) or {b) above. As regards (c), I took the general line that I knew of no pronouncement by any responsible person which could lend support to the reports in question; that many people, it was true, thought that the League should be reorganised to make it more useful; but that, whatever happened (and no one could foresee what would happen), it would astonish me greatly if Great Britain abandoned or despaired of the League. I adduced various considerations in support of my opinion, making it clear, of course, that I was only expressing my private views as between two friends, in accordance with Sheikh Yusuf’s request. 3. Mr. Philby, who was at Ashaira during M. Persico’s visit, spent the evening at my house on the 13th May. His account of the audience, based on what he had heard from his friends, and 'possibly from the King himself, was generally similar to that given me by Sheikh Yusuf, though not so complete and more loosely put together. He was even more outspoken than the sheikh about the perturbation caused in the King’s mind by the outcome of the Italo-Abyssinian war. The reason for the King’s reaction was, he said, his concern for British prestige. I could not get him to say definitely why the maintenance of that prestige should interest the King so greatly, but the implications of his language were clearly these : Reliance on Great Britain was the corner-stone of Ibn Saud’s policy. Great Britain had failed to oppose a successful resistance to Italy in the case of Abyssinia and had, in fact, let that country down. How, then, could the King have confidence in the will or ability of His Majesty’s Government to resist Italian ambitions in the Red Sea? Like Sheikh Yusuf, Mr. Philby spoke particularly of the Yemen, saying that, when referring to the intended negotiations between Italy and the Yemen, my Italian colleague had spoken of a strengthening ” of the relations between the two countries. 4. Mr. Philby is, as you are aware, not in the innermost secrets of Ibn Sand, and his language is very apt to be coloured by his personal sentiments. Nevertheless, I think that what he told me on the 13th May faithfully represents [731 h—2] j 1Ibn Baud’s present outlook. The King watches, as best he can, events in Europe, but he has little true comprehension of them, much less of such concepts as that of collective security or any sort of security upheld by moral force. He has little real interest in Abyssinia, and has seen in the recent conflict not so much a war between Italy and an African Power as a struggle between Italy and Great Britain. He sees in the result a sweeping victory for Italian force in this struggle. Obsessed, as he has been for years, with the fear of Italian ambitions in the Red Sea, he fears that that force may in the future be turned against the Arabian Peninsula. As a Moslem ruler still engaged in consolidating his position in Arabia and jealous of his hardly-won independence, he has no genuine love for Great Britain, a Power which blocks his way in various directions, e.g., in the east and south of the peninsula, but he has much less to fear from British policy on this side of it than he thinks he has to fear from that of Italy. 5. The only fortunate feature of this is that Ibn Baud probably believes that it was not so much the ability as the will to save Abyssinia that was wanting in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government as conceived by his simple mind. He probably still believes that a breach with them would be fatal to him, and hopes against hope that they would see him through in the event of a breach between him and any other European Power.

(866/368/4) Confidential &gt; British Legation, Jedda• 8th May, 1936, Sir, With reference to ay telegram No. 57 of April 30th and previous correspondence relative to the relations of Italy and Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to state that on May 7th Sheykh Yusuf Yesin informed me that Ibn Saud had consented to receive my Italian colleague at Ashaire, where Hie Majesty has been living, in camp for the last two or three weeks. The King had tried to excuse himself but had agreed to the visit after M. Persico had repeated his request four times, stressing the infrequency of His Majesty’s visits to Jedda and, finally, the danger of an unfavourable impression in iome, if hia wish were not gratified. He had explained that hie sole object wee to pay his respects. Sheykh Yusui thought that this was ti ue but promised to inform me, if anything more important came of the visit. 2. I said that I did not think that the action of the King in agreeing to receive the Italian representative would be misunderstood. It ie quite true that the King has been very little in Jedd© during the lest year and that M* iersico has had no opportunity of meeting him during that period as he was absent for both the King’s visits on February 26th-26th ana from March 26th to April 2nd. It is therefore not unnatural that he should wish to make sure of seeing His Majesty before the latter proceeds to Nejd. It may be difficult for el - . i to keep off such subjects as the training of Saudi aviators in The Hight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.O., K.P., Italy. &amp;c., &amp;c*, &amp;e.Italy, the Italian offer of aircraft and perhaps the proceedings of the now discredited Signor Udello or to ignore completely the recent Italian successes in Abyssinia. It is Indeed unlikely that my Italian colles* ue, who has probably acted on instructions from Rome, intends to undertake the somewhat laborious journey to Aehalra merely to say How do you do ? On the other hand I see no present reason to suspect a definite object on either side of major political importance. For one thing Sheykh Yusuf eaid that he himself would not go to Aahalra for the visit though a subordinate member of the staff of his Ministry would be In attendance. 3. I do not consider Sheykh Yusuf's information important enough to telegraph, unless any further developments should appear to invest the matter with greater significance. 4 .

Mr. Eden has had under consideration, i^ reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram No.63, the possibly increasing danger of Italy embarking on some new adventure in the Yemen. Although the balance of probability still seems to be against Italy attempting further acts of aggression in this area, the danger of her doing so clearly cannot be altogether excluded and it therefore seems desirable that every effort should be made to obtain a regular and rapid supply of such information as may be available which may have any bearing on the question. 3. I am accordingly to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Resident at Aden might usefully be instructed to keep a special watch on the situation, and to report by telegraph at frequent intervals whether there are any signs of increasing Italian activity in South West Arabia. 4. Possibly Sir B. Reilly may even consider it desirable that a special officer should be sent to the Yemen to observe and report on any developments in this direction. 5.

My Italian colleague visited Ihn Saud at his camp up country on May 10th in accordance with an arrangement of which Yusuf Yasin had previously informed me privately. Ostensihle object was merely to pay respects as owing to his recent absence he had not seen the King for a long time. The King had agreed to audience only after repeated requests. Arrangements ■were those usual in the case of formal [grp 0 omid.]. Yusuf Yasin has given me an account of what passed. Italian Charge d’Affaires spoke of facilities afforded to Moslems in occupied parts of Abyssinia before pilgrimage and of happy future awaiting Moslems there; of Italian misgivings about Saudi-Iraq Treaty (see my telegram No. 55); of offer of aircraft which he again described as wholly disinterested; and of proposed renewal of Italo-Yemen Treaty. The King replied politely but in general terms only on the first and fourth subjects. He repeated what Yusuf Yasin had already said about Saudi-lraq Treaty. My Italian colleague has since made oral communication to Yusuf Yasin regarding abolition of Ethiopian Empire and Italian annexation of Abyssinia. Yusuf Yasin enquired as to object and character of communication. He said that if it had any object ...2 . object other than to convey general information Saudi-Arabian Government could not concern themselves in any way with the consequences o^ a war in which they had declared neutrality. Ee expects written confirmation of Italian communication. Yusuf lasin invited my comments. I expressed personal views of the obvious nature on my Italian colleague's visit to the King and the subjects he had mentioned. ns regards later Italian communication about Abyssinia I expressed opinion that any Power which had previously recognised Ethiopian Empire would be well advised even if not a member of the League of Nations to avoid any hasty recognition of Italian annexation. Yusuf Yasin said that his Government entirely shared this view. In still more private and personal conversation as between friends Yusuf Yasin again voiced the King's fears of Italian policy in Red Sea and possible aggression against the Yemen. I expressed generally reassuring views.(E 2702/56/25) NO DISTRIBUTIOi . Code telegram to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda), Foreign Office, 20th Nay, 1066. 4.20 p.m. No. 55.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 139 of the 17th December, relative to the negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, I have the honour to state that the two Abyssinian delegates, who had waited until the 20th December for Fuad Bey Hamza’s return, left for their country via Port Sudan on the 29th December. 2. Both Mr. Calvert and I saw the delegates more than once in December, but up to the last they were very uncommunicative as to the objects and results of their mission, and confined themselves on the eve of their departure to a vague intimation that they had effected something. 3. Fuad Bey Hamza was more informative when I broached the subject during his visit to me on the 2nd January. He said that the Saudi Government had thought it inadvisable to conclude a treaty with Ethiopia at the present time, but had expressed readiness to receive an Abyssinian consul, if the Government of Ethiopia wished to appoint one, and to extend to Ethiopian subjects the same treatment as to those of Powers with whom they were in relations. I asked whether this had been effected by the exchange of notes, which he had fore shadowed in his conversation with me at Riyadh. He replied in the negative. He said that the delegates had brought two letters, and I gathered that what had been arranged had been embodied in a reply to one or both of these. 4. Although it was I and not Fuad Bey, who had reverted to the matter, I thought it would do no harm to mention that I had consulted His Majesty’s Government on the question of international law, which he had put to me in Riyadh, and that their reply bore out generally the personal opinion I had expressed. I added a phrase in the sense of the last words of the first paragraph of your telegram under reference. Inspired by the second paragraph of the same telegram, I observed, without stressing the point, that any extension of the friendships of Ethiopia would be welcomed at a time when she so sorely needed friends. 5. In view of the comparative unimportance at the present time of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, and the meagreness of the outcome of the negotiations, I have not thought it necessary to telegraph further on the subject. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. [606 dd—2]00 4 r'\ O H O U NO DISTRIBUTIO N De cypher. Sir A.

Fuad said that on receiving the report of our conversation of December 22nd the King had expressed fear lest I hod misunderstood his attitude. He had never wished to accept the Italian offer but had wished to consult His Majesty’s Government as to the best means of rejecting it. I replied that any doubt which the con versations at Riyadh might have left in my mind had been dissipated by Fuad’s language on December 22nd. 3. Fuad gave me to understand that the Italian offer had already been rejected. He referred to the embarrass ment caused by the arrival of samples of arms in October and said that although they had been inspected they were now being kept 'in safes' in barracks here. 4. Fuad said that the Italians were now pressing for the complete execution of original 'contract' to supply twelve thousand camels. me seemed to think that this demand could not be evaded but said that payment would be required • • •2 required in money. Arris would not lie mccopted instead. 5. I did not press Fuad for further information about the camel contract. It is noteworthy that lie now makes no pretence of the arrangements for camels having been made with merchants only, and implies that the Saudi- Arabian Government are themselves under a definite obliga tion. He seemed confident, however, that they could impose the condition mentioned in the preceding paragraph.V ss Q P /L S / v&gt; Decyioher. D. H- MO l&gt;1 8TH± BI TiON . Sir A.

Could I go so iar as to say, as from myself, that if the Saudi- Arabian .government commit themselves during the autumn to supply twelve thousand cainels, I should not expect His Majesty's Government to be indisposed by the fulfilment of tne contract although they would view with regret any fresh commitments of such a kind as to assist the Italian military operations? 3. As regards entry into the League of Nations I feel that however sympathetic I may make it appear, the complete neutrality prescribed in Foreign Office despatch Ho. 124 of 1933 may in the present circumstances be con strued as a discouragement due to anxiety on the part of Kis Majesty’s Government not to run the risk of having to give the same support to Saudi-Arabia in time of trouble as they have given Abyssinia. I appreciate the difficulties and possible dangers described in Foreign Office memorandum of ...2e of July 30th hut I would ask you to reconsider the matter as benevolently as possible. You may still prefer not to do anything to stimulate the discussion of Saudi frontier at Geneva but as regards slavery the objection to a successful conclusion of our own negotiations on that subject migho make it possible for His Majesty’s Government to take the line that promulgation of the proposed Saudi regulations would justify them in helping Saudi-Arabian Government to combat the slavery objection when raised in the League of Nations even though they cannot foresee the attitude of the other Powers. 4. Objection (1) under head 'Against”, page 5 oi print of Foreign Office memorandum of July 30th seems to me now more than before outweighed by the argument at (a) in column headed 'For”.^ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s G overnment, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] ^(E* 58/56/25)# To SAUDI-ARABIA . ■ l-Llll - Cypher telegram to Sir A.

Italian offer described in paragraph 4 of your telegram No.218 (of 8th December 1935) amounted in fact to political bribe and justified message to Saudi Government on lines of paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 141 (of 20th December 1935). Paragraphs 3 and 4 of your telegram No.2 suggest that Saudi Government now only contemplate sale of camels on strictly commercial basis without incurring any political commitment. 2. Supply of camels by sanctionist Powers is specifically prohibited. Saudi Government, however, are not bound by sanctions and are under no obligation to restrict sales to Italy unless they choose to adopt new conception of neutrality embodied in bills now before United States Congress involving no sales to belligerents of anything (except food) which may be used for the war in excess of normal exports. These circumstances and risk of refusal to execute camel contract seriously damaging Saudi-Italian relations render it undesirable to give Saudi Government a strong lead. 3. If Fuad Hamza reverts to matter you should tell him that it is difficult for His Majesty’s Government without full knowledge of its conditions to judge whether it is practicable to avoid fulfilment of original contract. Subject to this reservation Saudi Government know what issues are at stake and it is for them to decide in regard to present and any possible future2 . future contracts whether to give material facilities of a kind denied under League sanctions to a Power which has been recognised as an aggressor hy such striking consensus of international opinion, or whether to range themselves with those States which hy their action are trying to prove that aggression does not pay. 4.

I made lengthy statement, to Fuad December 22nd using your t^iogi c 'J:i under reference as rhe text, but emphasising it consideraoly by explanations and comments. I'Uc.d expressed no surprise at the refusal in naragranh 2 of your telegram. Ke confirmed my view that Italian action in either Sauai-Arabia or Yemen would constitute in Ibn Saud*s eyes menace which he feared. He suggested that apart from the danger of hostile action, the Italians might if (grp. undec.)ed stir up revolt in either country. I gave personal reason for thinking this impossible. 3. Fuad was more impressed than I expected by conclusion 4 of Rome conversations. He took it down and asked whether it would not be possible to communicate to Saudi-Arabian G-ovemment tnat paragraph and another which duly dealt further with British or Italian non-intervention. (I think this was due to a misunderstanding of part of my explanation). He thought that such a communication would definitely reassure the King, I promised to submit this request sympathetically but I suggested that it might be difiicuit to make such a communication except v/ ith the consent of the Italian Government, which it would be inopportune to seek in the present moment. I made it clear that if-u a coanunication were ne.de, it would in no sense constitute a commitLient vis-a-vis Saudi-Arab.ia regarding the action of iiis iiajesty's G-ovemment in the event of violation by Italy of f.oine understanding* 11 staoeu thac nothing; had passed 'betueen my Italian colleague mid the Saudi-Araolan Govemnent regarding the Italian offer. It had come through Odello uith whom he, ruad was in comjiiuiication, but who had, I gathered used an intermediary to make the actual offer. He said that Odello’s only explanation of the motive behind it was that Italy wished to see Saudi-.crab i a strong. j. Fuad assured me most positively that the ling did not wish to sell his friendship to the Italians for any amount v/hatsoever, ana was merely seeking means of rejecting their offer with safety. i_o i egards entry into the League of hat ions, I developed the last sentence of your telegram. I added carefully worued scatement that we had in the past been willing to help Saudr-Arabian Government with information as well as with our own views on the legal issues and necessarily non-committal lorecasts regarding the obstacles lihely to arise, he had not oeen consulted regarding the fundamental question of Saudi, policy involved, and I was glad of this. ,.s regards the obstacles, we did not think that the uncertain frontier would create insuperable difficulty, but slavery might. v. I-uad did not pursue the question of entry into the scagae. ..e did not think that what I had said need affect the completion of pending Anglo-Saudi negotiations about slave regulations and manumission. I said that I hoped to be able to resume these in the near future. 8. I made it my object throughout to emphasise the need for greato. great caution, and to assert the vieu that Saudi interests could not possibly be served by ass niation with Italy. Unless he vas deliberately deceiving ne, I think he was definitely impressed. lie promised to report to the King. Ee has gone to Mecca for the end of Ramadan and the ensuing festival. He does not expect to return to Redda until after December 20th at the soonest. 9. Unless there are very strong objections, I consider that it would be most useful to communicate to Fuad in a confidential personal letter the actual text of conclusions tvra to four inclusive of Rome conversations. My impression is that the Ring at least is sincere in his suspicion paid fear of the Italians, and that v/lth this encouragement he would reject their offer which may in any case not be as firm as Fuad represented it to me at Riyadh. 10.

Record of Conversations which have taken place in Rome between His excellency the Rt.Hon. sir Ronald Graham, GCLG., GCVD.,CB., His Britannic jvajesty's Ambassador in Rome, and Brigadier General Sir Gilbert Clayton, KC&amp;G., KBE., CB., on behalf of His Britannic majesty's Government, and His Excellency II Cavaliere Jacopo Gasparini, Governor of Eritrea, and His Excellency II Grand'Uff. Saffaele Guariglla, Director-General at the iiinistry for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Italian Government. THE above-mentioned aerates have, under instructions, from their respective Governments, discussed certain questions regarding British and Italian interests in southern Arabia &gt;,nn the Red 3ea. The delegates, acting under their instructions that the respective policies of the two Governments in jouthern Arabia &gt; and/5/ and the Hed sea should he pursued In a spirit of friendly co-operation and developed on parallel though independent lines, have reached the conclusion that their Governments are in agreement on the following points:- 1. That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to pursue a policy of pacification in order to avoid so far as possible conflicts between tne various Arab chiefs* That such influence as tne two Governments may be in a position to exercise respectively with Ibn 3 aua, the Imam Yahia and the Idrisi of Asir, should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict In order to arrive, if possible, at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs. 3. That while continuing to exert their influence in the cause of peace, the two Governments should not intervene in any conflict which, despite the efforts of the two Governments towards pacification, may break out between those cniefs. 4. That the guiding principle in British policy in the Hed Sea is the security of imperial communications with India and the .&lt;ast. For this purpose His Britannic majesty’s Government regard it as a vital Imperial interest that no European power should establish itself on tne Arabian shore of the Hed 3ea, ana more particularly on Komaran or the Fursan Islands, ana that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands shall tail into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler* That, on the other hana, it Is the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coast of the Hed sea that no European power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Hed sea, or on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands should fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler*• 3 • 5# That there should be economic and coiianercial freedom on the Arabian coast and the islands of the Red Sea for citizens and subjects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion, 6, That the presence of British officials at Kamaran is solely for the purpose of securing the sanitary service of the pilgrimage to Mecca, but that for administrative reasons His Britannic majesty* s Government do not consider it possible at present to agree to the Italian request for the participation of an Italian doctor in the quarantine service# But since the Italian Government maintain their point of view in this matter, His Britannic Majesty’s Government are disposed to reconsider the question when the number of pilgrims originating in Italian colonies or possessions Increases to such an extent as better to justify the presence of an Italian doctor. 7. That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to use their respective influence with the Arab chiefs in such a manner as to safeguard as far as may be possible the mstual interests of Italy and Great Britain, and that, oaerefore, it is desirable that the two Governments should maintain close touch with each other in all questions affecting the Red sea and southern Arabia, in oraer to avoid misunderstandings between them or misapprehensions on the part of the Arab chiefs in regard to the policies which the two Governments intend to follow In the above-mentioned areas- hQNALD GRAHAM.

I disclaimed expert knowledge of international law but said I thought such a transaction could not constitute breach of neutrality pro vided it did not provide assistance to belligerent, «uad then disclosed obvious object of his enquiry and said he thought it would probably be best not to conclude treaty with Ethiopian Mission which is awaiting his return here but to exchange notes according Ethiopia same position as a treaty power.

Correspondencs ending v/ith Jedda despatch Ho. 330 9 After we had practically completed discuBcion at Pl 3 ^--dh of questions dealt with in n,y telebrans Nos. 215, 216 and 217, Fuad asked whether I had instructions to speak aDoua the general international situation. He apparently hoped that I should have natericil for a conversation with the King. I replied negatively, hut at ny next audience I gave the King the opportunity of asking questions. His Majesty did not do so. 2. During soue preliminary conversation, Fuad adverted cursorily to various matters of international interest and threv* out the suggestion that the outcome of our negotiations on slavery might pave the way for the entry o± 8 udi Arabia into the Leaigue of Nations, for whose recent action under British guidance he expressed admiration. 3. 1 ■ ext day November 23th Fund spoke to me at length a sou o the position oi the Sauci Arabian Government, vis-t ..-vis Great Britain and Italy.

The buudi Arabi n Governu.ent had had correct relations v.lth Italy since 1932, but fundaiaentally they remained suspicious of It slim lifoitions. Durian the recent crisis they had felt unable to offend Italy, but had. done as little as possible to meet the requests of the Italian Government. They had refused to supply labour and when asked for 12,000 camels had provided 1,000 only up to date. The Italians professed to accept their excuses but saw through the game of c.ution and procrastination. 4. Fuad went on to describe the latest Italian offer, Italian Government were willing to take hall the number of camels originally asked for and to pay for then at fancy rate of £100 gold each. If they agreed, Saudi Arabian Govern ant would get £500,000, mostly in arms, of which satisfactory samples had. been supplied, but partly perhaps in cash. Ibn Baud was unwilling to accent this or anv other offer if he could get out of it, and Fund was deliberately delaying his return to Jedda until about Decsaber 20th in order to postpone the answer to 'ohe Italians until I had obtained the views of Fis I.ujesty's Government. Three problems arose, via., 1. If Italy menaced baud! Arabia, could, she count on the same support as had been accorded to Abyssinia? 2.

I confined nyseli to generalities hut I shall certainly he expected to express views of His majesty’s Government on the question of Fuad’s three prohlens when he arrives in JedGa. Although he did not say so explicit ly I have no doubt th at Saudi Arabian Govern ent would regard any Italian move against Yemen as the close menace to themselves which they have in mind. 2. I find it difficult to believe that Italian i Government are offering £500,000 gold in return for consideration so small as that indicated by Fuad. On the other hand I have no reason to doubt his statement that it has been offered even though he may have refrained from disclosing full conditions. 3. If Itali m Government are in f act bidding so high for Saudi support we can no longer take a refuge in uhe formula that His Majesty’s Government do not apprehend Itali n action in Arabia and do not answer hypothetical questions. Vague phraseology has become by-word in Saudi circles and is regarded as mere evasion of their appeal for British help and. coordination of policy, moreover they might well point to number of hypothetical questions which have recently had. to be put and answered in Dur^pe, e.g., between Great Britain and France.. 4. ...2 4. Assur-xices on lines of parr-graphs 6 and 7 of your teleyr.xi No. 100, which have roh yei dcg:~ uced, v r oulo. also in iny opinion fail to satisfy Bondi ArnDiuii Governi-ient that they could srfely defy It .lions even if nhey are sincere in professions of reluctance to sell thenselves for £500,000. As regards p.-r.-yrsph 6 of your teleyr^a Puad’s line appeared to he that if Baudi hjrahian Governiaena stood hy the League of Nations they should enjoy the benefits corn erred hy it 0 5. I assume His majesty’s Government are not prepared to outbid Italian Government or to ,,ive definite promise to intervene in the event of an It, lian menace to Yemen or Saudi Arabia. Something might possibly be achieved by giving Saudi Arabian Government clearer view of effect of Nome conversations with special reference to paragraph 4 of the record thereof. I am not very honeful of this but can suggest nothing better. 6.

I go36 EASTERN (Arabia;. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 6546/5599/25j Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—{Received November 8.) (No. 290. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, October 15, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 271, Confidential, of the 1st October, relative to the reactions in this country to the present Italo-Ethiopian situation. I have the honour to report further upon certain more general features of the situation, and to add some details, of minor importance, supplementary to the telegraphic reports submitted since the date of my despatch under reference. 2. I am informed by a fairly reliable source that the consignment of arms and munitions landed here on the 5th October from the Italian steamship Tripolitania, nominally from a firm in Italy to the Italian self-styled merchant Signor Odello, but in reality from the Italian Government to the Saudi Govern ment, reported in my telegrams Nos. 184 and 185, still remains in the Customs Department here. The nine Italian mechanics, or~instructors, who arrived from Massawa by the same boat are therefore believed to have at present very little to do. They still live in the Government-owned hotel here. 3. I am reliably informed that the consignment of 150 packages consists of 22 barrels, 1 large case and 127 cases of different sizes. This informant has more recently stated the belief that the large case contains a car, probably an armoured car, but that twenty-two of the smaller packages contain medical stores for the Italian Legation. He added (on the 12th October) that it was reported that a large travelling car, of some well-known Italian make,, luxuriously fitted with dining and sleeping accommodation, with a wireless set, &amp;c., was shortly to arrive here as a present from the Italian Government to Ibn Saud, whilst to-day he reports that an Italian ship, the Ernani, of the Industria Navali Soc. Anon. Linia, is expected to arrive here to-day or to-morrow and to discharge a large truck with trailer, weighing about 10 tons. This, he considers, might be the caravan de luxe for Ibn Saud. Two experts are said to be accompanying the vehicle for the purpose of assembling it on arrival and instructing the eventual driver. 4. Since my despatch No. 232 of the 13th August, when I last referred to the Saudi press and drew attention to the complete silence of the Umm-al-Qura and the Saut-al-Hejaz on the subject of the Italo-Ethiopian crisis, there has been some change. Both organs have appeared with articles on the situation and with copious reproductions of telegraphic reports from various sources on the situation. The articles so far have not been in any way objectionable, and generally, I consider, may be attributed to the authorship or inspiration of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. In some instances the news items have contained reports of a probably erroneous and tendentious nature, usually emanating from Egypt, and quite possibly of original Italian inspiration. For example, the report of the presence of sixteen Italian submarines in the Red Sea was given some prominence, and statements regarding the exodus of residents in Egypt to safer quarters in Palestine and Syria in fear of the menace of Italian aircraft from Cyrenaica were reproduced. As reported in my telegram No. 185, I took an opportunity on the 6th October of alluding, in conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, to the prevalence of misleading reports, and suggested that the Mecca newspapers would do well to take care to avoid sensational news. The Umm-al-Qura, a newspaper which appears on Friday of each week, now announces that it will publish a daily news-sheet (except Fridays), containing telegraphic reports of current events. 5. No further information has been received regarding the purchase of camels by the Italians. It would appear probable that more information will be available in this respect shortly. Purchases would appear to have been made [556 h—1]almost entirely in Nejd, for not only are reports of purchases in the Hejaz completely lacking, but complaints have been heard locally that Nejd, and not the Hejaz, is reaping the benefits accruing from this deal. The distance to be traversed by the camels in coming from Nejd partly explains the delay in their arrival. My Indian vice-consul also reports that it is believed locally that camels purchased from the northern districts of Nejd will be shipped from Rabigh and Wejh, and those from the southern districts from ports in Asir such as Jizan and Qunfidha. This may well be the case in order that the movement should be kept as unobtrusive as possible. It may, indeed, be wondered whether the camel of Arabia is likely to be a success in the highlands of Abyssinia, under the rigours of a winter campaign. 6. The sympathies of the local populace remain as strongly favourable to Abyssinia as before. I am informed that a few days after hostilities had commenced in Ethiopia a crowd collected in Jedda to listen to news broadcast from a wireless set belonging to a certain inhabitant of the town, and that items of news favourable to Ethiopia provoked cheers and cries of “ Down with the Italians! ” from those assembled. It is even asserted that the Italian Charge d’Affaires protested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs against this hostile demonstration as being inconsistent with the friendly relations subsisting between the two countries, Saudi Arabia and Italy. In consequence, it is said, the headmen of the various quarters of the town have received instructions to prevent such demonstrations in future. 7.

I met a high and reliable person who is conversant with the policy of Arabia, and consulted him about his opinion in respect of tl-e news published by certain papers, and telegraph companies on the subject of the obscure position of the Saudi Arab Government toward* the war between Italy and Abyssiniao He definitely assured me that 'there is not even the slightest obscurity ii the position 'of the Saudi Arab Government, as the Govemrent of H.M. 'the King Abdul Aziz do not intend to deviate: from the 'position of complete neutrality during this dispute 0 ' He also stated that 'the policy to which the Government of 'His Majesty will zealously adhere to is the preservation 'of friendship with the two Governments, as of friendship 'with all Government?; they have no gain by any hostile 'action against either of the two belligerents, so long as 'Saudi interests are respected without inter: erence 0 The 'Saudi Government wish that peace may prevail in all 'neighbouring countries and everywhere.'(.© Tribal news has it that Bin Saud is still making heavy camel purchases* and persists in saying that the King is ^ preparing for a big raid either North or South or North- &gt; ' Westerly direction, but they cannot say for certain where. COMMENT. ^ (i) The above somewhat alarmist stories are reported for what they are worth, hut it would he unsafe at this stage t0 attera P t t0 prophesy, what Bin Saud has in mind, if he has anything at all. The prohahilities are (as already mentioned in para.Id8 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No .15 and Comments) that Bin Saud's heavy buying of camels is to resell them again to the Italians at a personal profit, and that feeling that he might arouse criticism among his people who are very anti- Italian by such action, he is spreading the report of set purpose, that he intends raiding some supposed enemy, hostile to Nejd. Bin Saud is, as we know, an expert at influencing public opinion, and what easier at the present moment than to drag a Kuwait, Aqaba, Yemen or Qatar red herring across the path of his real intentions. (ii; The Shaikh of Kuwait in a conversation on 26th October about this very sub d ect, gave it as his definite opinion that hau no hootile intentions whatsoever against any State or person, and that all his big talk in Riyath was so much propaganda in order to focus the eyes of all the tribes on himself, and to keep them 'guessing'. This always had a good effect internally, and helped to mystify outside Governments.

Bin Saud himself before his departure left on a so called ’'hunting 1 ' trip for a mysterious destination, with 200 cars full of armed men. Riyath gossip suggests Aqaba as the King’s destination.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 237, Confidential, of the 20th August last relative to the reactions in this country to the present Italo-Ethiopian crisis, I have the honour to submit a brief account of the general attitude and public feeling, in the somewhat limited area with which I am in touch, towards this dispute and the parties involved in it, in order to supplement the information I have ventured to telegraph at some length regarding the attitude of the Saudi Arab Government as communicated to me by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. 2. It may, I consider, be confidently stated that the general sympathies in this part of Saudi Arabia are undoubtedly with Abyssinia, and are perhaps as strong or even stronger than they were when I addressed to you the despatch under reference. It has been even said that some criticism has been expressed locally of the Saudi Arab Government for not having adopted an attitude more definitely friendly to the Abyssinians. The recent growth in the number of wireless sets now privately owned and successfully operated in Jedda has helped to foster an intense interest in the day-to-day fortunes of this situation. In the latter part of September, both at Mecca and Jedda, the sensitiveness of the local inhabitants to the gravity of reported developments at Geneva led to a wide spread movement to buy up food-stuffs and other goods to hoard against the day when supplies by sea, upon which the urban population of the Hejaz so largely depend, should be interrupted, if not cut off. The impulse to hoard was short lived, and the efforts of the local authorities and the effect of more hopeful news contributed to restore confidence and to allow prices, which had risen appreciably, to return to normal. 3. I have as yet observed no sign of anti-British propaganda of Italian inspiration. Indeed, the feeling here at present is that the only hope of the avoidance of hostilities lies in the firm attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and while feeling towards Great Britain may be considered friendly, it is believed that pro-Italian sympathy, even in limited circles, scarcely exists. 4. Signor Odello, as I have reported by telegram, has now received permission from the Saudi Government to purchase camels. He has paid a lump sum in advance, and his broker left some days ago to arrange to collect the animals. They have not appeared in Jedda yet. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed me that he had imposed no limits either in respect of the number of camels bought or the time taken in acquiring them, although he did not exclude the possibility of placing restrictions on the operations of Signor Odello later. No further consignments of other live-stock and such commodities as fresh fruit, vegetables, fodder, &amp;c., have been shipped to Massawa, as the first experiment turned out unfortunately for the Saudi merchants engaged. It is reported that the vegetables, fruit, &amp;c., perished owing to the lengthy delay which occurred at Massawa before the goods could be unloaded, and they had to be thrown over board, the loss falling on the shoulders of the Jeddawi merchants, who were to receive payment upon the consignment landing safely at Eritrea. 5.

Yesterday he informed me however that in view of reports in foreign press in which Saudi Government were variously represented as pro-British, pro-Italian or pro- Abyssinian, it had been decided to cause a statement to appear in Egyptian press through Saudi agent at Cairo to the effect that Saudi Government’s attitude towards dispute was one of neutrality 0 Statement would appear as having been learned 'from a reliable source”. There would be no similar statement in Mecca press. I gather that this announcement is declaration regarding neutrality foreshadowed in conversation of October 6th. 2. Yusuf Yasin expects to leave for Riyadh within next few days as Minister of Finance returns today from abroad. He suggested that important disclosures could be made to Abdullah Sulaiman pending the return of Fuad. 5. Arms consignment believed to be still in customs,. A large motor truck and trailer of Italian make arrived here October 16th for Saudi Government. It is stated to have been accompanied by two Italian mechanics.Date. Initials. SU.B JECT.

The Foreign Office reply to the Saudi request for a definition of H.M.G. 1 s policy, which was naturally^ very cautious and non-committal, was to the effect that the Italo- Abyssinian dispute was before the League of Nations and that H.M.G. could not define their attitude in the event of an Italian menace to Saudi Arabia in advance of some evidence of the existence of such a menace. H.M.G. were unable to advise the Saudis on the question vhether they, should agree to sell camels to the Italians. (P.Z.6707/35). 3330 1000 12.34 2/2. Mr. Calvert then had several further discussions with Yasin, who was^fervid in his protestations of Saudi friendship for H.M.G. In this connection Mr. Calvert’s very tentative proposal (Jedda telegram No.159 of 7th September - P.Z.6637/35) that in his personal capacity he inconsistency between their professions of friendship for K.M.G. and their actual attitude over Koweit and the question of the dispensaries, was turned down by the Foreign Office. We could, I suppose, hardly object to this. The Foreign Office advice to the Saudis to maintain an entirely impartial attitude and to avoid offending the Italians (Foreign Office telegram No.109 - P.Z.6637/35) seems to have been in accordance with the actual line taken by the Saudis vis-a-vis the Italians. Mr. Calvert was given discretion, if pressed by the Saudis, to assure them that, in the event of unfortunate developments, H.M.G. and the League would not be unmindful of any who helped in the general cause and that in the event of an Italian attack on Saudi Arabia, which would be a direct violation of Italy’s undertakings to H.M.G. under the Rome Understanding of 1927, H.M.G. could not remain indifferent; but he did not require to make use of this discretion. 3. The Saudis showed some anxiety lest ships which normally carried pilgrims might be diverted round the Cape from the normal Red Sea route. In this connection I understand from the Board of Trade that there i s no truth in the rumour (mentioned in the telegram on P.Z.7277/35) that the Blue Funnel Line are to Saudis agreed some time ago to supply camels to the Italians in exchange for arms, but that they hoped to keep the actual state of affairs secret in case H.M.G. should conclude that Ibn Saud openly preferred Italian to British friendship. The public arrival of a consignment of Italian arms naturally caused the Saudis some change over to the route via the Cape. 1'OLiTICAL COMMITTE.*.,' 4.

Yusuf Yasin at his request visited me this evening. He expressed the King’s approval of his proposal that we should meet regularly in order to keep in touch over present situation. (2) He led off by alluding to differences which had cropped up with Italians over delaying camel transaction. Sheikh said that in about three weeks camels would be com ing along and in two weeks limited number would be deliver ed. (3) I should recall that he had mentioned reach.ness of Italians to supply Saudi Government with arms,etc.,. This was not a new offer but had been put forward first at the time of the Amir Saud’s visit to Italy in recognition of friendly relations between two countries. Saudi Government considered themselves Ireo to acquire munitions of war where they pleased. In normal times would do so, but the delicate international situation made offer embarrassing. Saudi Government finally agreed to see any samples submitted and thereafter arop tne suDjeot. To his consternation on the evening of October 4th he was informed by Italian Legation that a consignment of arms was due to arrive next day by Italian steamship accompanied by party of (gr.undec.) experts from Hat company 0 He got into wireless communica tion® . „communication with the King whose first reaction was to re fuse permission for consignment to land as such action rould he interpreted as pro Italian, Subsequently consignment (which was addressed to Odello) was landed and remains in customs. Saudi Government takes the view that it was from an Italian company to an Italian merchant here and is therefore commercial and net political in character e Con signment consists of small arms, a '(gr.undec.) car', a quick firing field gun,etc. (4) The Sheikh saw Italian Charge d’Affaires yesterday evening to explain the position.. Persico during conversa tion stated that Bagdad Times recently published statement that Saudi Government had agreed to support Great Britain in imposing sanctions if necessary and enquired whether this was true. The Sheikh denied the truth of the report- but upon being pressed to deny it publicly, had replied that he was studying the question and could not then give any reply, (5) The Sheikh explained at the sam* time that he feared that Persico’s object was not so much the aementi itself as to manoeuvre Saudis so that Italians could claim that they were against sanctions and detach them from any possible association to that endo Here the Sheikh alluded to recent announcement of Italian Spanish commercial treaty. He further alleged that statements similar to one from Bagdad had ap peared in Syrian venacular press and were (he thought) of Jewish inspiration from Palestine c Saudi Government in consequence were considering advisability of making their position,whioh was one of neutrality, quite clear by means of a public statement and I gathered, that thi long delayedo He had informed Italian Cha s would not be rge d’Affaires3 . ohat clieir policy v, r as one of friendship towards ell parties concerned. (6) The Sheikh assured me that Saudi policy of friendship towaias his Majesty's uovernment had not changed and repre sented their attitude over camels and arms as being a pur suance oi tneir policy of 'courtesy' towards Italians. They would maintain this policy until the situation and His Majesty’s Government’s policy developed further - if His Majesty’s Government remained at peace with Italy all would he well, if not Saudi Government would then reconsider the position in the light of their interests. The Sheikh asked whether I had any observations. I replied that I had noted his statement and had no doubt that my government would find it of interest. His manner was less assured tnan usual and I felt brief acknowledgment was the best until you had considered the position. (7) I purposely changed the conversation by alluding to prevalence of misleading propaganda, instancing Egyptian newspapers, humours were rife loyally and I suggest Mecca newspapers could exert calm influence by avoidance of sen sational news 3 i made use of seme of the material in your telegram No. 118 and gathered that the Sheikh was acquainted with terms of Prime Minister’s speech. He follows radio broadcast very keenly and to that extent is well informed. (8) I need hardly point cut speciousness of Saudi argu* ment that consignment of arms is a purely commercial tran* sacticn.

You should therefore inform Yusuf Yasin orally that His Majesty s Government have noted with appreciation the King's further declaration of policy and his explanation of his eresent posi uiorio His Majesty's Government regard situation ’which he has in mind as puxely hypochetical, and unless it. becomes a reality it will be both prudent and correct for Saudi Government, while scrutinising2. -7*=&gt;r xs scrutinising every Italian proposal with care and even suspicion, to maintain entirely impartial attitude towards to in parties to Italo-Ethiepian dispute. His iiajesty's Government have meanwhile no wish to offer advice which would render it difficult for Saudi Government to maintain appearance ox impartiality, and would even suggest that they should take particular care not to give Italian Government any cause to complain that their attitude is biassed. t. if Saudi Government raise again question of camels, jou may say you understand His Majesty's Government have not so far taken steps to prevent sale to Italian Government of livestock from e.g. Sudan. 6. If Saudi Government press you to indicate attitude of His Majesty's Government in event of Italian attack, you should remind them that His Majesty's Government have shown their full intention of acting in any unfortunate developments of the present situation as a loyal Member of the League; and that in the^e circumstances, the Saudi Government may rest assured that neither His Majesty's Government nor the League in general ixculu be unmindful of any who had helped them in the general cause 17 ’ An attack on Saudi Arabia would be a direct violation of Italy's undertakings to His Majesty's Government under the Rome understanding of 1927, and here again His Majesty's Government could not remain indifferent. —[This Document is the Property o f His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Jecypher i:il D.

BiPOKMlS- oCc - Your telegrams Nos. 133 and 139 (of August 25th - attitude of Saudi Government towards Italo-Ethiopian dispute) You should reply as follows to five Questions put in paragraph 7 of your telegram No. 133o 1. As you rightly stated, His Majesty's Government have from the beginning done their utmost to secure a peace ful settlement of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. That dispute is at present before the League of Nations, and His Majesty’s Government have no desire to pre-judge it, the more so as the Italian case has never yet been fully stated to that body. His Majesty's Government are, however, seriously concerned by what appears to them to be the evident intention of the j_ tali an Government to impose a settlement of the dispute by armed force, and in such a manner as to conflict with the principles of the League of Nations and Italy's other inter national engagements, rather than by the methods of arbitra tion and conciliation provided for in those engagements and generally accepted as governing the relations between all countries. 2 and 3. As the Saudi Government will appreciate from the foregoing, the answer to these questions must depend on the recommendations of the League* of Nations. 4. His Majesty's Government cannot define their attitudeattitude in advance of some evidence of a menace to Saudi ..iraDia. ion may add, as your personal opinion, that tiie contingency foreseen by sneifh Yusuf Vasin does not seem immediately probable., 5» x should prefer to avoid discussion of question of camels as far a-s possible, but if tins Sheikh reverts to the question you should inform him that it is one in which His majesty’s Government are in no way concerned, and. they re~ r 'ret that they can tender no advice to the Saudi Government.(00 I^CZX£ In any further communifiation on tlii^ subject, please No. J 1 and address —not to any 'person by name, butlto— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 e^qu^te | THE Under-Secretary of State^f or “Foreign “Affairs presents his 1 &gt; 7, 5992 1335 C °HFIDE NT , Al complimentg to its to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, resei 1^5 transmits herewith co P^| of the under-mentioned paper.

Slieikh Yusuf Yasin at reception on arilval of 'unir baud this morning asked to see me this evening. 2. Ke began conversation at once by saying that he was charged with message from Ibn baud to Mis Lajesty’s Government. He recalled that during Saudi-Yemen war he had on several occasions spoken with His Majesty's Iinister concerning attitude of Italian Government and had received assurances that that Government were neutral. baoidi Government had followed advice given and had maintained correct relations with Italians. 5. Corning nearer to present events, he alluded to Italian- Abyssinian dispute and asserted Saud.i desire to maintain friendly relations with all governments. Particularly in view of kindness and hospitality shown to Amir baud whilst in Italy they were anxious to keep on friendly terms with Italian Government. There fore negotiations with Abyssinia which had been going on since delegation was here in the Spring (refeience Jedda despatch Ho. 116 of April 20th) had been suspended until present dispute was over as Saudii wished to avoid creating impression of taking sides. 4. He went on to speak of activities of Italian merchant Odello, recently arrived here (paragraph 245 .etc. of Jedda renort of July;. Odello had. approached Saudi Government about 6 weeks ago with a request for permission to recruit labour’ for Hritrea. ThisI'liis the haudi Government had been obliged to refuse as inconsistent with neutrality should hostilities break out (paragraph 240 of Jedda report of July)* 5. Odello next requested baudi Governinent to permit purchase of camels for liritrea to the extent of 10,000 to 12,000 and asked to be allowed to see the King at hiadh. Ibn Baud replied that Odello should discuss the matter with minister of Finance. Latter agreed to the export of 200 to 300 camels per mensem but placed so many obstacles in Odello s way as almost to nullify concession. In consequence Odello again sought permission to interview the king at Riadh and on this occasion Ibn Baud did receive him. 6. Odello saw the King twice and had conversations with Bheikh Yusuf Yasin in the course of which he admitted frankly that he was not a merchant but an Italian military officer specially deputed to purchase stores. In conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin he also conveyed veiled threat that if Saudis showed no compliance there would come a time when Italians would retaliate. He offered good prices for camels and cash advance of £10,000 and offered to supply Saudis with arms and ammunition. Saudis continued to maintain that as a government they were unable to enter into any such arrangement but placed Odello in touch with one or two private individuals who would act as go-betweens in purchase of camels. 7. Yusuf Yasin then referred to attitude of His Majesty f s Government towards Italian Government over Abyssinian question. This attitude had not at first been fully grasped but latterly appeared more definite as one of opposition to Italian aims. The King therefore asked what was present situation in regard to that attitude (Ibn Baud had hitherto had to rely on press state ments which were frequently incorrect). Ghat would His Majesty's Government 1 s5 . Government s attitude be should Italy persist in her present course? i/as definite action intended or would His Majesty*s Government content themselves with a declai'ation? Vvhat moi eoVei v/ould be attitude of His Majesty*s Government if Saudi Arabia found herself menaced from ,! the South” (Yusuf Yasin evidently implied, by the Italians through the Yemen)? hhat were His Majesty's Government's views regarding sale of camels by Saudis to Italians? High prices offered would yield a substantial benefit to Saudis concerned and could not lightl} be foregone. Perhaps, said Yusuf Yasin seemingly by way of suggestion, His Majesty's Government would attach no great importance to the deal? 6. He specially asked for immediate answer and stated that he proposed to remain in Jedda in order that I might communicate it to him.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be /-s returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Frova. b...J. jDI ^d,\hlA .

Tiie Minister, as soon as he arrived at Turin from Genoa, went to Cavoretto for a few days’ rest. Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale is a true Arab from Mecca, and a distinguished engineer, who has been sent by King Ibn Saud to Italy on a special mission with the special object of worKing out a new and comprehensive organisation for communications in his country corresponding to road and transit conditions there. During his visit to Turin Rafaat El Ahdale showed considerable nterest also in the aerodrome. He was impressed by the high degree of perfection which we have reached in various spheres of engineering and electricity and particularly by those of our factories which can successfully compete with the greatest enterprises abroad. Mohamed Rafaat el Ahdale, who is paying his first visit to Europe, travelled in an Italian steamer, and is enthusiastic on the subject of the Italian mercantile marine. In reply to questions by representatives of the press Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale, stated that his country under the rule of Ibn Saud is at present enjoying a period of peaceful prosperity.

[E 1787/704/25] No. 1. Treaty of Friendship between the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of the t Hejaz, Nejd and its Dependencies.—(Communicated by Italian Ambassador, April 4, 1932.) (Translation.) HIS Majesty the King of Italy, on the one hand, and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies on the other; animated by the desire to establish and consolidate the bonds of friendship between the respective countries, have decided to conclude a treaty of friendship; For this purpose His Majesty the King of Italy has appointed Commendatore Guido Sollazzo and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Nejd and Dependencies has appointed His Royal Highness the Emir Feisal as their respective plenipotentiaries; Who, having examined their credentials and having found them to be in good and due order, have concluded the following :— Article 1. In consequence of the recognition by His Majesty the King of Italy of His Majesty Abdulaziz-bin-Abderrahman-el-Feisal-al-Saud as King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies, close ties of sincere and enduring friendship exist between His Majesty the King of Italy and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies, and perpetual peace shall prevail between them and their respective kingdoms and subjects.

Article 3. The contracting parties undertake to use their endeavours to maintain good relations between themselves and to take steps to prevent their territories being used by any party as a base for illegal acts against the territory of the other party. Article 4. The nationals of each of the contracting parties shall enjoy in the territory of the other party, subject to reciprocity, most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to their persons and their property.

(Translation.) lour Royal Highness, Jedda, February&gt;10, 1932. 1 HAVE the honour to assure your Royal Highness that the second para graph of article 6 of the Treaty of Friendship between Italy and the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies is intended solely for the purpose of determining the procedure to be followed in the handing over of the property of Italian pilgrims deceased in the Hejaz. Ibis will take effect without prejudice to the procedure relating to the estates of deceased persons who were not pilgrims, which will be accorded the reciprocal treatment that is the basis of the usual practice between independent States. I have, &amp;c. GUIDO SOLLAZZO. (4.) The Emir Feisal to Commendatore Sollazzo. (Translation.) Jedda, February 10, 1932. IN reply to your note of to-day's date regarding the estates of our subjects who die in your territories and those of your subjects who die in our territories, I desire to assure you that the procedure in regard to them will, as you have stated, be on the basis of reciprocity in conformity with international usage. His Majesty's Government will therefore arrange to take charge of the estates of your subjects who die in our territories and, after the legal procedure has been completed and the relative taxes collected, to hand them over, in the absence of a legal administrator of the deceased in our country, to the Italian repre sentative at Jedda. The Government of His Majesty the King of Italy will reciprocally under take to take charge of the estates of our subjects deceased in Italian territory and, after the completion of the legal procedure and the collection of the relative taxes, to hand them over, in the absence of a legal administrator of the deceased in your country, to the competent representative of the Hejaz for that territory or, failing such a representative, to His Majesty's Government. I have, &amp;c. FEISAL. (5.) Commendatore Sollazzo to the Emir Feisal. (Translation.) Your Royal Highness, Jedda, February 10, 1932. IN the course of the negotiations which have happily concluded in the Treatv of Friendship between His Majesty the King of Italy and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies, I had the honour to explain the point of view of the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy in regard to the traffic in, and the manumission of, slaves, which is as follows: L The Government of His Majesty the King of Italy, in virtue of the high principles which inspire their action in the struggle against slavery, consider it necessary that the Government of His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies should assume the obligation of co-operating with them,' employing all the means at their disposal, in suppressing the slave trade. Such co-operation is destined to strengthen that spirit of mutual assistance and collaboration between the two Governments which animates and guides the joint and determined action of all civilised nations against slavery. 2. Similarly, the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy desire that their representatives at Jedda may be assigned the power to manumit and repatriate any slave who spontaneously applies to them. 1 desire to assure your Royal Highness that the exercise of such a power by our representatives should4 % not be at all considered as an interference in the affairs of your country, but as a means whereby the co-operation of the two Governments in regard to the problem of slavery can be more actively and closely carried out. I trust that His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies ^ will appreciate this attitude on the part of the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy and the reasons which induce them to maintain their point of view in this matter. I have, &amp;c. GUIDO SOLLAZZO. ( 6 .) The Emir Feisal to Commendatore Sollazzo. (Translation.) Sir, Jedda, February 10, 1932. I HAVE considered your note of this day's date regarding slavery. The Government of His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and Dependencies, while appreciating the humane sentiments which have induced the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy to make the request contained in the note under reference, desire to make the following explanatory statement on this subject:— 1. The suppression of the illicit trade in slaves constitutes one of the most important questions to which our Government have directed their attention. His Majesty my Sovereign, from the day on which he ascended the Throne of the Hejaz, has displayed particular interest to the end that the entry of slaves into his territory should be prevented; it may, in fact, be said that for several years no person has been able to import slaves into this country. The Government will spontaneously persevere in this line of action. 2. As regards the paragraph numbered (2) in your note, His Majesty’s Government are using on their own initiative their endeavours within the country to reach the end which is enjoined by our Islamic law with its principles of supreme justice and its pure sentiment of humanity. The reason for which our Government abstain from granting the power requested in the paragraph numbered (2) of your note is that such action in our territories is a sole and exclusive right of our Government.

Your Majesty, I have the honour to remind your Majesty that, in the course of our negotiations, which have happily resulted in the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and good understanding between His Britannic Majesty and your Majesty, the question of the frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan was discussed, and I explained to your Majesty the position, as defined in a draft protocol submitted by me to you, which His Majesty’s Government have taken up on this question and to which they must adhere. His Majesty’s Government regard the above-mentioned frontier as being defined as follows :— The frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan starts from the intersection of meridian 38° E. and parallel 29° 35' N. which marks the termination of the frontier between Nejd and Transjordan, and proceeds in a straight line to a point on the Hejaz Railway 2 miles south of Mudawwara.

Nevertheless, in view of our true desire to maintain cordial relations based on solid ties of friendship, we desire to express to your Excellency our willingness to maintain the status quo in the Ma’an-Aqaba district, and we promise not to interfere in its administration until favourable circumstances will permit a final settlement of this question.

Your Majesty, In continuation of our conversations relating to the question of the slave trade, I have the honour to inform your Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government feel it their duty to abstain at present from renouncing the right of manumitting slaves, which has long been practised by His Majesty’s consular officers, and which enables them to liberate any slave who presents himself of his own free choice with a request for liberation and repatriation to his country of origin. I wish to assure your Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s insistence on this right is not intended to mean any interference in the affairs of your Government or any infringement of your Majesty’s sovereignty; but that it is due to His Britanmc Majesty’s Government’s resolve to carry out a duty which they owe to humanity. I would add that His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment will be prepared to consider the abolition of the right of manumission as soon as it becomes clear to both parties that the co-operation stipulated in article 8 of the Treaty of Jeddah has resulted in the enforcement of such practical measures as to render the exercise of the right of manumission no longer necessary. I trust that your Majesty will appreciate the attitude of His Britannic Majesty’s Government in this matter and that you will see fit to acquiesce in the procedure which I have described above.
