To support this, the document gives a history of recent affairs in the region, making extensive use of correspondence and memoranda mostly written between 1874 and 1879. The principal correspondents are from the Government of India, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and various political and diplomatic offices in the Persian Gulf, Turkish Arabia, and Constantinople. The matters covered by the document concern events at Bahrein [Bahrain], Guttur [Qatar] - including Zobarah [Al Zubarah], Odeid [al-â€˜Udaid], and El Bidaa [Doha] - Lahsa [al-Hasa], and the Trucial states.The memorandum concludes by outlining the position of the Foreign Office, the Government of India, and the India Office (represented by the author) on the following four matters:1. The status of Odeid;2. The need to better define areas of responsibility and jurisdiction with the Porte, and whether to hold them responsible for order along the coast under their authority;3. A revision of Britain's treaties with Bahrain, the Trucial chiefs, and Muscat;4. The arrangement of Persian Gulf business between the Bushire Residency and the Baghdad Political Agency.The author quotes extensively from the correspondence and other sources, notes on which are to be found in the margin throughout.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Odeid</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>El Bidaa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lahsa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zobarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Piracy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003dc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
