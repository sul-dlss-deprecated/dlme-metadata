No - 0/ &lt;^P F '93 Political Agency, Bahrein, Dated the 14th i? ebrusry 193 From THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. To xiie non f ble tiie Political liesiaeat in Persian_ ^ Busiiire. Sir, I have the honour to report t^at certain aemonstrat- ioxis occurred after the issue of tiie proclamation of the Bahrain GoYernment concerning inheritance,of which 1 enclos a copy. I propose to gite a brief survey of the circum stances which lead up to the issue of this proclamation. 2 . About a year ago i discorerea that the provisions of the Order in Council regarding inheritance were to a great extent being ignored and the property of foreigners was being disposed of without any reference to the Agency, cases only being referred to whes when some dispute ttour occurred,and/owing to thisjwhere some of the heirs were minors the whole property was even 'liable to- disappear * before they were of ag^.e to protect themselves. ±t was of little value to them to have tne right to sue on attaining majority if the money had all disappeared, a particularly glaring case came to my notice where an unfortunate Persian minor had the greater part of his patrimony filched from him before tiie Agency receiveu any notice of what was happening,and it was found that when the Xanxxx Shiah auhi himself hau undertaken the administration of the child T s estate,a very large proportion of the esUte had been consumed by uis administration charges. 3* i therefore issuer a proclamation embodying briefly the provisions of trie Order in Council regarding2 . ) V ^ inheritiaice. 'ihe proclamation crested some exciternent amongst the foreigners and a number of them came to see me,they haying nite misunderstood tne meaning of certain clauses and they had imagined that the statement that the Court mi^ht take oyer an estate,meant that the Court necessarily would take ever all estates and administer them. I explained to th»m that if an executor were appointed by the deceased he would naturally be allowed to function until there was some yery strong reason against it and tuat the Court would never take over tne administration of any estate except as a last resort. ±hey were satisfied by my explanation ana I issued a second alan to clear up the misunderstanding. 4 . The Bahrain Government had observed my action and throughout last year began to notice an increasing number of cases where widows ana orphans had been defrauded sometimes of their entire inheritance,an injustice it was usually impossible to rectify as their patrimony had literally been swallowed up in tne sea. These instances had been largely brought about by the collapse of the pearl market, ana prominent merchants found the diversion to their own pockets of funds placed in their charge for the benefit of widows and orphans the easiest way out of their financial difficulties. 5 . The employment of the estates of minors for diving is prohitied by Shara T a law and this is univer sally admitted and it was also universally admitted that many merchants had misappropriated large sums. Tne general feeling’ of the public,however,was that it was bad luck for those who happened to be caught ana that owing to the bad pearling seasons the Government should3. C£) i aot be too hard on them. God had sent the bad pearling season*so it was really his affair. 6. The matter had been discussed among the 3ha ikhs for sometime and when three glaring instances had come to t] the instance of the Bahrain Court,it was felt that some thing had to be done if the Bahrain Cover men t were to take their responsibility for justice towards widows and minors seriously, in one case a certain Shahin bin Sagar had left an estate variously estimated at 10 to 15 lacs * of rupees for his widows ana children, k few months ago hi; his widow,who had been refused relief by tne ^auhis, applied to the Bahrain Government for help in recovering her share. After great difficulty the nahrain Government succeeded in obtaining tne so called accounts oi the administration of the estate, it was admitted by ali bin Gagar,the executor,tnat tne widow was due Hs.1,35,000 apart from landed property,but he stated that he was unable to pay her a penny as the money was all tied up in pearls (for which there was no sale at the monent) and tne bulk of the landed property had been mortgaged to others. ihree similar cases occurred in quick succession and the idviser asked me if i would discuss means of combating the evil with him, haikh Abdulla and Shaikh alman,the son of the Deputy roller, a meeting was held in my drawing room and the details of the proclamation it was proposed to submit to Ghaikh Hamad were discussed. Shaikh Abdulla or Shaikh Sulman,i forget which,wished to include the / Sunni waqfs and the ’athlaths^or ^ one-third of estates given for charitable purposes) as well as the question of protecting widows and orphans. They wished to issue &amp; proclamation on the lines of the Agency proclamation of last year,but 1 strongly advised them to postpone theI question of waqfs as the Qaahis fight it to tne last nitch and aJso the question of athlaths because many prominent men had disposed the one-thirds of their rv?latives estates in their own businesses and their united opposition would wreck any attempt to improve existing conditions, i was not much impressed by the project of interfering in these thulths for/they hast been faithfully observed in the past,the greater part of the property in Bahrain wauld now be endowed fur Vkguej&amp;nd to our ideas, useless objects,whereas the sums could be much better employed by the living in their own businesses. ' • ^ peinieu out to bna iich Abdulla that any inter- t erence in the present system by which executors,appointed or sell appointed,could use the estates of orphans for their own purposes witiiout ]et or hindrance would provoke * great deal of opposition,end I said taat the Qadhis would strongly resent anything that encroached upon or enquired too closely into the powers they at present enjoyed, i told him that Bahrain was approaching a step which had long sg© been reached in England and recently in Iraq,Syria and Egypt where the ecclesiastical power had had to make way for the secular,but that Sunni Oadhis and the interests they represented were very powerful and ceuld not be ignored, he laughed and said 'Who are tne Qadhis? They are only three old men!* I replied 'Yes: but old men with very long tongues'. 1 advised them to issue something much briefer than the Agency proclamation as anything on those lines would be certain to be mis interpreted and suggested that they sheuld content themselv* by a proclamation which ensured that Gevernment should see that wills were registered,executors appointed amd that if a person died intestate his property was protected. &amp;1 proclami©f three short sectioiis ©&amp; those lio.es was drawa up and tiie matter was tnen uiscusseu with S-iaihh Hamad by Hhaikh Abaulla,uhaikh Salmau ana tn^ *uviser. 3. xixkx The Shaikh himself nad always warmly urged the need tor protecting the estates ol widows aad orphans but has shown himself very unwilling to prosecute anyone proweri to hare stolen them. His excellency,! regret t© say^ feels that the criminal law exists only for the poor and that if a wealthy merchant happens t« malversatc a matter ©fa lac or two belonging to his brother T s widow it was a business misfortune ana not a crime. However,he warmly supported the issue of this proclamation which was issued on tne 23rd January 1332. The proclamation was issued while i was in iioiuf and i imagined that the Adviser would have secured the agreement of as many praminent men to it as possible before it was issued, bat apparently he only shewed it to the Shiah Jadhi, '.nan Sahib Yusif bin Ahmad Kanoo and a few other persons in Manama who were in favour of it and otherwise did little in this direction. This was a mistake for the usual method af paving the wsy for enactments that are likely to hurt people’s feelings is to show A4 to as many as possible who sapper! it ana to get. them t© place their seals on rt and then sead tixem to talk over those who remain recalcitrant. This may appear a curious method, but it is the one wnich obtains in Bahrain and usually produces tae best results. * public meeting t© discuss any important project invariably achieves nothing. 9. Until Sunday,the 7th February,! heard nothing to show that the proclamation had met with any opposition but on that day the Adviser informed me that censiderable opposition to it was being fermented by the Sunni Qadhis in Muharraq and that though many people must have died since the proclam- h&lt;v»a reported to the6 . Banrain Caurt. IvJ. A party si praaiiaent /nea cams ©yer frviu iuiiharraq anti talc t^e Ady^ser tuat t^ie^ iiac beeii to see ^iiaikh Abuulla abaut trie pr^claraatiaa a*a that ne haa tala tuem U g# ta the iav iser, witiisut giviiig aay expiaiiatiiiia • f tae praciamatiaa to them altaough it was largely his xianaiwark. They discussea the matter with, the Adviser &lt;vith same a eat and taeii said they v/oulu go out t® hhai&amp;h Hamad* lie t#lci tneni taey could please themselves about seeing him. Thoy went out to haichir and the ht^aikii told them very plainly tnat he was determined to protect the interests ©i widows sag orphans, that it was his duty to do so as a Ruler, that the proclaims tiou was designed to achieve this and had been issued by him after careful consideration. 33. He enquired what objection they had to it and they produced a series of fantastic rumours saying that they uad herra that Government risbcc ts take 2 ver *ii the estates oi all sc as t© tax them,taking perhaps one-third or one-half of tuc estate sc\c tua t they iiac even heard tliat the dead were not allowed to be buried without the sanction of the Governor meat and that men had been placea at the doors of cemeteries U prevest anyone being buried without Government permission. Ihey urgod him to withdraw the p roc lame ti or hSi he refused point clank to do so and haa the matter ended here,probably &amp;« more would have been heard of the agitation which would riHve gradually subsided. However,with the weakness which renders him so futile as a Ruler,when asked what answer they should take back to Muharraq,his nerve failed and he said 'I will let ycu know tomcriw'. 12. He sent a special man that night to discuss the matter with the Adviser pud myself and the man,who is his chamberlain,stated that the Shaikh proposed taking the Initiation down by night ana that when asked next day what7. his reply was,he weula say 'tne proclamatian is gwne - that is all”, i showed him that this wauld make him the laughimg stecK frem Muscat to isaghciaci aad tftat the excitement had really arisen because the great rmjerity ef the peuple had net read and did not uanerstam tne preciamatiea. I advisea hi him to tell the Shaikh to write to shaikh Abdulla and ask him to collect the leading merchants &lt;*f ^uharraq ana explain the _ . J real object ®f tiie proclamation to tnem. thought this would oblige Shaikh Abaulla to come aowa on one sine or other of tne fence. He replied to tne Shaikh next day that ”the \ merchants 'Aou^d explain their views to him personally. Actually he nau done nothiag whatever^ 13. Hext day 1 paid my id calls on tne Shaikhs at * i«uharraq[ (Shaikh hamad,nowever,oeing at Sakhir; and on visiting Shaikh Abuulla noticed that he seemed uneasy ana that he brougl his sons back iut© the majlis as they left after greeting me, evidentl.) with the idea of preventing my discussing politics with him. Before the close of the visi t,however. I asxeo if I might Lave a word with him ana he dismissed his sons. I tola him that he had been one of the prime movers of the proclamation and that it was his duty to explain it t© the people ana allay the agitation as far as possible. I also asked him why he had made no/ attempt to explain matters to the Muharraq merchants ana despatched them to the Adviser without a word # rte said they would net listen t® him,a palpable lie,since he is all powerful in tfuharraq. I remined him that uu I had warned him that trouble might ensue ***« that he had laughed at my Blaming and he replied ’Tesrbut who thought they would carry o® like this”. 14. Next day I had to call on the lending merchants at ivluharraq and noticed that there were large crowds about ind tnat the shops were all closed. There we re, however, no signs of disorder. 1 enquired from tne Adviser whether heA £ o 6 8 . believed tuat tie a^itatioa wquIci increase yr mminisii and. ne seemed tj think that it w»uld die a natural death. At this time the tr^ubl e v/as Incalized in Muharraq and 1 had insuificieat evidence form a csntrary npinien. On i'eanesday however,it was clear that the treuble haa spread to hanama arid aIi the sh *P s *ere closed in sympathy, mother deputatiun from Muharrnq went tt see the Shaikh at Sakhir and a large ueputatien of panama also went out ana behaved in a most disgraceful manner in trie Shaikh’s majlis. 'ihis latter deputation had some revolvers among them and had commandeered trie cars which tiok them cut. They presented a most insolent petit is* which the Shaikh unfortunately did not read. They shouted,screamed and stated that they would not have any Oorerament interference or any interference by the Qadhis anc that they would manage things just as they saw fit. The Aiaos and some of the young al khalifa who were present were much put out by this impertinent autburst^for they regard oaharna as canaille^but Shaikh Hamad gave them mild words and they left having extracted a promise that he would 'see what he could a®.' 1^. 1 had oeen out to see tne Sn&amp;ikh the preceding uay ana had found that ne was aetermined to cancel the ©ffenaing proclamation. He was muen a la me a ana had evidently heard exaggerated accounts of what was happeningjin iwuiiarraq. I founa it impossible t© persuaae him to take any action against tiiose ft do were stirring up trouble on all sides thougn 1 told him that he would make himself ridiculous and damage the prestige ©1 nis Government if he withdrew his proclamation at tne first signs oi opposition,without making any attempts t° explain his motives or deal witu those who were setting the whole place by tne curs. 1 also told him that 1 was amazed tc hear cnat he allowed the Bahama to insult him in his own majlis.9. ✓c A It &lt;r &gt; 16. Oa Tuesday the Adviser asked me to reissue my pro clamation as he thought this would have a good effect. I 'Ljt doubted this,;it in a slightly abbreviated form. On &gt;,eanesQay the foreigners began to take an interest. All shops in Manama | were closed and on Wednesday night both my proclamation and that of the Bahrain Government were torn down. On Thursday I received news through my own sources tiiat a Persian merchant had sent a launch to Juharraq^ t® bring over Persians ”to ask the Government what they were going to do'. This put an entirely different aspect on the matter ana the situation became serious,as a crowd €*f ignorant and excited Persians entering the manaiua bazaars might have produced,a riot at any moment. The Adviser apparently knew nothing ©f this. In tact tne out standing’ feature of the whole affcMU* had been the fact that no inf © nasi ti an whatsoever was forthcoming from the official sources in Muharra^ until the situatien was almost out of control. For this we have to thank the inefficient ana inadequate dispositions made by the Commandant of roiice,Captain Parke. There are n© Bahrain police in Muharraq with tne exception of 6 sepoys of the Indian armed police. These know neither Arabic nor Persian,nor are they encouraged to tahc any interest in local affairs,but had a post &lt;jf Bahrain police been there reliable news woula have b^en available from the start. Graer is supposed to &amp;e maintained b, tne A mir with naturs. The Amir of Muharraq is worthless reptile who was removed from the sane post in Manai.a for incapacity and I had frequently^i^S Shaikh Hamad to replace him by a more reliable man. At no time aid the ami seno any information wnatever that any trouble was brewing, in fact his only message was sent on Thursday morning when he reported that the Bahrain Government and Agency proclamatio * had been torn down by persons unknown ^najhool*.10 . © Or lieanesciay^ when a disturbance might have eccurred at aay moment he retired ta his hduse and said that he was ill. ^r.Belgrade had considered replacing the Indians by lacal men when Captain Parke went an leave but had ant been able to de sa before the trouble started,the result being that he and the Shaikh were completely in the dark as regards happenings in iiuharra^. 17. I askea ^ir. Bel grave to get into touch with the 'ersian situation immediately, and he seat some men in plain clothes to Miharraq at once,but the tide fortunately went out and prevented further incursions, i sent for the merchant alleged to have despatched the launch, but before he SSaS^fiasan . usa ibi came to see me a mu saiu that my alan had caused some excitement amongst his community and the Persians had/asked about it. I xid told him that it was a resume of the one which I had explained to Abdul Aziz Qusaibi the year beforewhich the foreigners had then accepted. He seemeu satisfied,but askeu if I would receive some Persians and Nejdis. I said I would be glad to see them. 18. Some half an hour Irter a nixeo. body of twenty Persians anu (Mejdis came to see me. They said that great excitement was prevailing and that their comru uni ties had been agitated by the Bahama and Bahrain Arabs. Some of them were men to whom l had explained my proclamation the year before, and I asked them why they were now so disturbed by that they haa accepted and understood last year. They tola me that they had not understood it properly then and that all kinas of rumours were current. I saia i knew this and chaffed them about some of the more ridiculous ones and askea them if they believed them. They said they did not,but that the T jahil’,the ignorant,aia,ana that they were the people who would cause trouble. They then asked me to withdraw myproclamrtion^since the i^aiirain GoTeniment had withdrawn theiis and this i refusea to do. I asked them what they objected to, since it was not proposed to do anytning that nad not been the practice in the Agency since the Order in Council was instituted,and some replied that the things mentioned in the alan had never been done before. I said that if they referred to the fact that executors were required to give notice of their executorship,they were quite right,and it was because this was being neglected that i had had to issue the notice. I enquired if they had ever known our Agency courts to deal with a Ohara f a matter instead of sendir^ i t to the Qauhis for settlement,ana they admitted that they naa not. 19. They professed to be alarmed by the statement in the alan,that if there were no executor appointed in the ,’»ill the uourt would appoint one. fthat hourt dia this mean? I said that such a matter woulu naturally be referrea to the Shara T a,who would appoint one in accoraance with the pro visions of the Holy uaw for that particular sect. This partly satisfied them,but they still urggd me to withdraw my alan. It woula have been agreeable and easy to refuse to alter or withdraw it,but they were eviaently in a state of excitement and scarcely able to listen to reason. Since Hasan Qusaibi in particular^and some of the others,were obviously trying to help as far as they could,it would have seemed ungracious to have refused to do any tiling^ and with all the foreigners in a troublesome mood the situation might have deteriorated rapidly, it seemed to me that though the alan was nothing but selected extracts from the Order in Council ptifeet some of the paragraphs were open to wilful mis interpretation and that if these were deleted the main effect of the alan would be the same though expressed differently. The principal opposition was to the clause which required executors to give notice to the Court,which certain professec to believe the thin edge of all kinds of interference ana12 . inquisition. 1 said,however, tnat I could not give way on this point,and after three hours discussion they agreed to a modiiied alan which sounded more agreeable to them,and at the same time had much the same f* effect as the one tiiey objected to. 2J. mey retired,and evidently prevailed upon their communities,for further trouble frora Persians anu Nejdis ceased,and on the next day,Friday,! walked through the bazaai myself and found them all opening their shops or willing to do so. There were sufficient police to persuade the large gangs of suspicious looking loafers to keep their hands from any attempt at looting and as the day progressed the situation became more normal. Early in the morning tne Adviser came upon a large gang of Somalis wno flea at the sight of him,so evidently there were not lacking persons with guilty intentions. 21. Next day,Manama was quiet,but 1 beard that when Shaikh Hamad Visited kuharraq on the Sunday (he could not postpone his xd visit any ionger) he was going to be met with a series ol concerted demands,wnich seemed to cover everything tro/n a request that respectable merchants should not have summonses served on them, to a request that tne Baladiyahs should be abolished. I went to Sakhir and warned the shaikh about this ; and he said he would be prepared for it. I told His excellency that Manama was now quiet,and that the question of the foreigners had been settled^and inquired what steps he proposed to take against the instig ators of all the trouble,particularly the two authors of the particularly insolent petition of the Bahama. He went off into a long discourse about what Bin Sa'ud did under similar circumstances. 1 again asked him what he was going to do. He said ’’if I do anything now,the whole trouble will break 1 out again”. I agreed that immediate action might produce a13. /C..A V ^ recrudescence of the trouble, but I told him that if he allowed such instigation to pass without anyone suffering,bis weak ness would be patent to all. He went of in another long harangue. I again asked him what he proposed to do and he finally said 'I will wait now ana let them cool down. Then 8s you know there is the party of so and so and the party of so and so (mentioning some four parties). Presently they will start to quarrel .and then I will move this man against that and that man against this,and then perhaps 1 can do something''' • 22. Three things have been fully demonstrated. The utter futility of Shaikh Hamad,who remained throughout at Sakhir leaving the Adviser and myself to shoulder all the respons ibility,when firm action on his part at tne start would nave stopped the whole affair. The auplicity of Shaikh Abuuila, who though really the prime mover in the preparation ana issue of the elan did nothing whatever to assist when the trouble which 1 had warned him of staned.anu the inefficiency of Captain Parke’s dispositions of the forceS of xaw ana order in Bahrain. 23. Shaikh Hamad displayed a regrettable tendency to Blow to agitation when some divers took it into their neads to create trouble two years ago. I knew him to be weak out it remained for this incident to show me tne complete extent of his incapacity in an emergency, lie was insultea in his own fajlis by people who belong to the weakest element in Bali rain, and his only action has been to dismiss one of the ringleaders from his seat on the Manama Municipality. The view of the al Khalifa present may be judgea by Shaikh ibdulla's remark to the Aaviser after the event. He saia 'whatever happened afterwards ,! should have haa those two (the leaders of the Bahama) taken outside^ and floggea'. 24. When asked in 1929 to report on the general situation in Bahrain,! wrote that Shaikh Abdulla was no longer openlyPagin’ the Goyernment, but Uiat i doubteu the leopard couiq cnaage his spots so soon. Whether he ueliberateiy inslig- crj ated this proclamation with the object an agitation to ahich the Shaikh woula have to yield, thereby making him look ridiculous I cannot say. I have since received clear proof thct he mace no attempt to check Ine disturbance as he could easily have cone,and he certainly gave no warning whatever of the early stages of the agitation though he must have been fully aware of it. /.hen Shaikh Hamad asked him to take certain persons out of his kajiis and talk to them,all he is reported to have said was ? &amp;na wiakuia T ,meaning in Bahraini Arabic ’i am with youwhich could only have had the effect of encouraging the malcontents 25. Until the last day of the agitation,no info mat ion whatsoever reached the idriser from official sources in kuharra ^and for this the blame must rest with Captain ■'arke. The Amir had long been known to be utterly useless,and yet with the exception of six Punjabi sepoys the Government had no source of information in this troublesome town of 2u,00o inhabitants,since the naturs coulc only report through the Amir. As i have said before,the Punjabis are not expected or intended to do anything except guard duty,for their ignorance of Arabic or Persian precludes their performing the normal duties of police. This,then,was the disposition of the police left at Pr.Gelgrave T s disposal b^ Captain Parke,ana though both he and Shaikn Galaan haa detected tne weak spot,unfortunately action nsd not oeen taken to amend it before the trouble started,though 1 should mention that Captain Parke had only recently proceed/on,leave. With proper police arrangements the trouble would have been detected at least a week earlier and steps taken to check il 26. X am confirmed in the view i have always held,that a firm control of the foreigners by the Agency is essential,for ohaiick Harnad is incapablo of dealing with eyen the vve?:\er lac lions amongst his own subjects. I fear that the .Bahrain uoyernment have suffered a decided set back,and tiie reactionary element jj.ave won a decided success,and that in a matter when the Government were fully in the right. 1 have tne Honour to be Sir, Your iost Obedient Servant, y|&lt; Political Agent, Bah rain.

The police arrangements at Muharr&amp;q certainly seem to have been defective. Captain Prior informs ■ne that the situation is now norio&amp;l, and if X can manage to visit Bahrain again in two or three months* time, I will endeavour by discussions with merchants and others to pave the way for a re-introduction of tne Orders.

It is a great temptation to use our undoubted power in ahrain to act as a fairy godmother and bring blessings on the country, but we come in for a great deal of abuse in the process -ind I think it is the turn for indigenous effort no«, and that ikh Kamad should be made to provide the effort. 3, I dont think it is any use trying to resurrect the late proclamation, even with the weight of your presence, I have always held the view that the Seeirfent k- o way, settling problems with a wave of his hand or passing orders. This business does not quite fit into this conception, and I am well spend a week here and imagine the trouble settled and then find it spring up again after your departure. The recalcitrant are either so deeply involved in eating the portion of the wi- dow and fatherless as to be irreconcilable, or so stupid and argue for an hour with the voice of Gbariel km with prople 1; bin Lindi, and find at the end that they were repeating exact] what they were saying at the beginning. The lie that Goverau who discovers how much money their husbanda have not left. 4. Also, I think we can attain much of our obj*''' 2. Shaikh Hamad gets £ 10,000 a year for ruling tuese islands nd think he should be made to try and earn a fraction afraid the result might not be altogether successful. You mignt misinformed that their skulls are impenetrable. One might wants to tax estates and pry into peoples affairs has got too long a st^rt, and kfcx even the women who have most to benefit from the proclamation resent it as they consider the Government Sourtr too public and prefer that it should be the secluded ^adhj &lt;. simpler method. I suggest that an alan be publishec that no one may administer the estate of a deceased wi\RHH ^3 ) i^age 2. th o authority of a Qadhi. The Shaikh could order them to send the will of any estate t ,ht came to them to the Bahrain Government •' ment for registration as soon as they received it, and so tne principal object of the old proclmation would be attained. r To One could object to such an alan, if their intentions were ’ khalis,* and the Qadhis would have the ground cut from under their feet. They would probably charge handsome fees for pro bate and so make themselves unpopular and so pave the way for further peaceful penetration by the Bahrain Government. I would however f, till leave it open to anyone to take his estate to the Bahrain Court first, should he desire it. 5* I sug est that the Shaikh be told that he cannot al- . low the present state of chaos to continue and that he must be stir himself.to improve it. That it is for him, as ruler, to t^ke the matter into his hands and not to rest until he has effected this improvement. He is certain to discuss this with mv: and X could then make the above suggestion to him, telling him that it is for him and his fellow Muslims to purge the State and not for Belg^rve and myself .ho are unbelievers. If he can ! think of a better plan, he is welcome to do so. 6.
