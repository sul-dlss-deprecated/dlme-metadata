BAHRAIN RECEIPT. , ■,-% , * *7 • r c • I’he Hesideo^y Agent’s note is*. 1 comprehensive and explains how t^is fund came Into being. It is purely an unofficial fund originated by my predecessor. At present it shows a credit balance of Ss 5,75,362/4/9 of whiQh ! 2s 3,06,418/6/- is deposited in the.hational Bank‘in the name of the Shaikh o-f Dubai, The Fund is operated by the P. 0., T. C. It was proposed by Tandy that the deposit of Ss 3 }.akhs be - util ized after the war for education . e. the building of a sch ool or schools. This is an exc llerit scheme but gives rise the following problems : - (A/ U+ (pi+n** (SJ X)* jh\ tlM I ' C*, 4 6u*,(. tuXi*** Lau/CCl t Cy\ c ^&lt; e^c^u^duUi. (a) Are we morally; entitled to utilize- t' is money for any purpose athev than for what it is now being' used'i.e. subsidizing the sale of wheat to enable - inhabitants of the Tracial Coast to get their grain at a cheap rate ? •advisable (b) - If we are morally entitled, would it be ////////// to ut'lize the money for any other Purpose i.e. to withdraw, the wheat subsidy ?. . * If. it s d sc • s- oui d the money be transferred 'to the Hospital Fund or used for educational purposes as originally proposed to 20. Deference (a) and (b); Now that t v e price of sugar has •s fallen in Persia and the cost of wheat risen, the Fund is now'/ . being expended at the rate of Is 51,000 per mensem. If this continues, the present balance of is 5-J lakhs will be exhausted in about 12 months. ifter that the local people will have to | pay full price for their wheat. The Government of India allow the Crucial Coast 50 tons of sugar monthly for barter purposes. | I have no files for reference but as far is I can remember it costs us is 64 per bag. The price of sugar in Persia soared to fantastic heights and in our barter transactions (mainly for dates) we made considerable profit - as much as Is 300 - 400 per bag. , this (We now make only is 50 per bag), _ As sugar is allotted . • • • specifically• • • 21 f specifically for barter purposes for the Trucial Coast, the local people presumably have a moral right to derive some benefit from these profits. This they have done and since January 1944 j we have supplied them with wheat at lower than cost price and met • » the 3-0ss from profits made on the -sugar. We have now, to decide whether to continue subsidizing at the present rate for about 3-2 months^at the end of which period we may find ourselves with a ' nil balance and nothing tangible to show for the expenditure of our profit, or to invest part of the profit now in something from which the people will derive lasting benefits i.e. educational or medical facilities. .In my opinion,-we can legitimately use this money for any purpose so 'long as it is for the benefit of the people and I am strongly in favour of transferring the Is 3,06,362 now in deposit. This would leave 5s ^68,943 which is at present with the Trading Companies for .subsidizing wheat. . .If the price of wheat remains at its present high level‘and we continue to mahe a profit on su~ar at Is 50 per bag, this sum will suffice for five months only. ' At the end of this period the people would have to | pay full price for their wheat. If the pripe of wheat remains high, a sudden withdrawal of the subsidy would probably cause some . hardship and would certainly cause some discontent to start with. The people will however benefit in the long run and I consider /of * that it would be better to spend Bs 3 lakhs on someth!ng/lasting value than to spend it in 7 months on subsidizing grain. In any case, the people will eventually have to pay full price for their grain and the problem remains the same whether it presents itself after five months or twelve months (unless of course the price falls to the subsidized level). If the withdrawal of the subsidy results in acute hardship and we are faced with a maoor problem then the question of invoking Government aid may have to be considered. Without having the files to refer to // I am at a disadvantage but I think the question of asking Government to subsidize grain surplies for, the Trucial Coast was at one time considered.21 . ( 2 ) 3 If the P. A. agrees with my arguments and decides to transfer the deposited amount, I suggest that we immediately decrease the monthly subsidy by a certain amount. This will make the balance of Rs 2,68,943/3.4/9 last longer than the estimated five months and also accustom the people to paying a little more for their grain. I suggest we decrease the subsidy gradually, e.g. 2 months at 40,000 80,000 2 months at 35,000 70,000 1 2 months at w o o o o 60,000 2 months at 25,000 50,000 Rs 2,60,000 . , - This would make the present balance last for eight months instead ' of five but the question of the 5 / for the Trading Company will have to be taken into consideration and necessary adjustments made • * + according to the prices of sugar and wheat, should they fluctuate. It is to be hoped that the price of wheat will eventually fall. If P. A. agrees, I will work out detailed proposals in consultation with the Residency Agent. (I cannot at present because the files 1 are in Sharjah). 22 . 7 ^/ (u~du~cl it 7 Reference (c). If it is agreed to transfer Rs 3 lakhs from the Subsidizing Fund I suggest we credit it to the Hospital Fund. I am in full agreement with the original proposal to utilize it for educational’purposes but rather than have two projects . insufficiently financed I consider we should combine the resources at our disposal and concentrate on one at a time. I personally consider the people stand in greater need of a hospital.than-of a school and therefore recommend that we start on that first. A.There are two funds under the following heads (a) The Subsidizing ITind, and, (b) The Dubai Hospital Fund. • (a) The Subsidizing Fund . CrUHPtAL. This fund was started in January 1944 deriving its income from profits collected on sugar sold for barter which is used^for subsidizing grains and meeting the Food Companies T 5 C ? profit, custonjs duty and other petty expenses. The account of this fund is kept by the Dubai and Sharjah Food Companies who submit monthly statements to this Agency showing showing closing balance on the end of the preceding month, receipts from the sale* of barter sugar during the current month, payments made during the month to subsidize grains and credit balance on the 1st of the new month. P/hen the fund was first started a sum of Rs.300/- used to be collected on each bag of sugar. This was later reduced to Rs.200/~ due to fall in the price of sugar in Persia and was further reduced to Rs.50/- in Parch last for the same reason. The procedure is that when the Food Companies take delivery of the cereals and receive U.K.C.C's invoice through their local agents, Messrs.Gray, Mackenzie, they pay the amount of the invoice and then apply to this Agency for authority to pay the difference between the amount of the invoice and the amount at which the cereals have to be sold to the local people plus all other expenses out of the subsidizing fund. The Agency issues such an authority after scrutinizing their account and comparing it with IX.K.C.C T s invoice, a copy of which is usually forwarded to this office. The amounts of this fund are deposited with:- (a) The Dubai Food Company, (b) The Sharjah Food Company, and, (c) The National Bank, Bombay,(In Shaikh of Dubai f sname) and the present balances (on 20.9.1945) are as follows With Dubai Food Company .Rs.175,142.0.6 With Sharjah Food Company ' 93,801.14.3 With the National Bank,Bombay ' 306,418.06.0 A/c. ,&gt; * UJ\ a, (j c * t fed ^ Lx aJA^ A-m/p Rs. 575,362. 4.9 As regards the last named item, a sum of Rs.300000/- was remitted and the sum of Rs.6418.6.0 represents difference of exchange which was credited. It is not known here whether any interest has accrued on this amount. Captain ‘Tandy T s idea in making this arrangement was to preserve this amount in order to be spent on education after the war. ACCRUING ASSFTS. Rs.25,000/- a month,collected on 500 bags of sugar allotted for barter at the rate of Rs.50/- a bag. It always happens that barter holders do not buy their sugar if the’ , market^is not good; this results in the accumulation of the sugar in which case large sums remain in arrears. FXPHFTDITURF. Taking the figure of 800 tons of wheat as our fixed monthly quota a t the rate of Rs.420/- per ton as a basis for our calculation, we will lose about Rs.71,000/- a month on account of difference in the cost, the Food Companies r 5N profit and other expenses. We will lose a further J sum of Rs.5000/- on account of the Companies 1 5^ profit on 400 tons2 of barley which are to be imported on barter basis(assuming that this quantity does arrive). Thus the total losses to be met will be in the neighbourhood of Rs.76,000/- a month, but by setting off Rs.25,000/- which will be accrued by sale of barter sugaar, a sum of Rs.51,000/- a pproximately will have to be paid each month from the Subsidizing Fund. • TJ.K.C.C. used to charge Rs.55l/- per metric ton of wheat but for the recent consignments they charged Rs.408/- and Rs.420/- per ton; the last mentioned rate being comparatively very high and mil absorb our subsidizing fund very rapidly. (Our average monthly expenditure from the fund for subsidizing wheat was Rs.25,000/-). For shipments which arrived at Dubai and Sharjah in August last TJ.K.C.C.charged Rs.408/- and Rs.420/- per metric ton. (In this connection please refer to P.A.Bahrain T s Memo.No.2535-29/1 dated 19th June 1945 in which he said that the Trucial Coast will be getting Canadian wheat the price of which will be ID.30/250 per metric ton (which is about Rs.403/-). If the price of future consignments remain at Rs.420/- per ton and 400 tons of barley will continue to be imported monthly on barter basis, we will have to draw from tho subsidizing fund Rs.51,000/- a month to meet the differences (after deducting Rs.25,000/- which will be obtained from the sale of barter sugar). As already shown our present local balances in the fund are Rs.268,943.14.9. By allowing an expenditure of Rs.51,000/- a month, our local balances will suffice for 5 months. Mhen all the fund is used up, we will be confronted with two alternatives, viz., either (a) to draw the amount we have deposited in the Bank in India or (b) Increase the price of the wheat to cover cost price, the Companies* 5^ profit and all other expenses. Personally I am in favour of (a). It may be noted that the shipments which arrived in Auvust 1945 have not yet been subsidized as I have to clear up the question of short weight of bags which I will deal with in a separate communication.(b). The Dubai Hospital Fund (i) The total sum. deposited in the National Bank, Bombay for this Bund is Rs. 199,245’/-. This figure is made up of the following: - T Subscriptions Rs. 192,007.0.0 Difference on exchange __ ' Total.. .RsT 199,245.'OVCT' This amount was raised by subscriptions contributed by the Trucial Coast people in 1944 and the main items contributed by the Trucial Shaikhs whichaafe included in the above amount are as follows:- Shaikh of Dubai Rs. 50,000 Tt rT Sharjah..... . fT 10,000 ft Tt Abu Dhbai.... n 5,000 ” ' Urn al Qaiwain” 1,000 Shaikh of Ras al Nhaimah 'and his subjects contributed Rs.lOOOf and the Shaikh of Ajman and his people contributed Rs.7000.

' ' SHARJAH FUNDS ” After reference to R.A., Sharjah, if necessary, please let me have a note giving full particulars of the monies held by the Trading COfjmiittee in Dubai and of the proposals for disposing of them. P.O.T.C . Id./- C.J.P., 10/9/45. CAPTAIN MURPHY * s NOTE DATED THE 3RD OF OCTOBER, 1945 . This was received from Bushire today. Id./- R.E.R.B., 10/10/45. 1. I have detached the note below on the 'Sharjah Funds' from the note by P-.O.T.C. on the Dubai Hospital Scheme. 2. These papers should form the beginning of a file, to be kept in C.O., entitled 'Sharjah Funds' and it should be shown to Colonel Galloway after he has taken over here. 3. The proceeds of the 'Subsidising Fund' are merely a form of 'Baksheesh' from the Government of India and if circumstances permit I see no objection to spending them on a hospital. But it must first be fully confirmed that the people can either buy cereals at a price higher than the pre-war price or that the cereals will fall to that price,and also that there is generally enough to eat,before diverting this sum to a hospital which is a luxury if the people’s bellies are empty. The coming winter will be a hard one in many parts of the world and the T.C. may not escape the effects of the world food shortage. I am, therefore, a little apprehensive of P.O.T.C.’s proposals 23.10.1945.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001e1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1746</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001e1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1746</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 29/5 Sharjah Funds'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-17T11:27:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (9 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 9; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
