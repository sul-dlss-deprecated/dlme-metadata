After discussion with Mr. Baxter, it has been agreed that this Office shall send a reply 'Zgvcs* forwarding copies of the/ or?Gis of the Persian Gulf Treaties, and adding such comments as we wish, and that the Foreign Office shall then write to the Admiralty, expressing concurrence with what we have said. The series of treaties available to the S.N.O. is as set out in paragraph 2 of his letter of the 7th June to the Govommont -trf'-i~ndi-a. The first item in that series is the Foreign Office memorandum, Special 8, of which a copy is flagged •U” below, and which contains the full text of the Katr Treaty of November 3rd, 1916, and details of the assurances given to the other Chiefs in the Gulf during the first period of the War. The remaining six items are the series of Treaties and Undertakings contained in the parchment-bound volumes on P. 2902/16 below, [fith the exception/. . . .. (r egUff exception of the Moharamerah Treaties^ (Tione of them run to a later date than 1916, and, while it is true that nothing of real importance has taken place since then, there have been certain supplementary engagements, and our view of our position under certain at any rate of the Undertakings in question has been defined. The Admiralty have it r ^#u«v«&lt; ( ua contemplation to supply the S.N.O. and the Gommander- in-Chief, East Indies, with a copy of P.G. 13, which will give them the historical side. For the moment I suggest that we should content ourselves with supplying the Admiralty with sets of the latest precis of Gulf Treaties, indicating that these, in certain respects, supplement the set of Treaties quoted by the S.N.O., and adding that, should the Admiralty or the Naval Commander-in-Chief still think it desirable, in view of this, that the full text of the various Treaties should be available to the Comnanding Officer of each of the three or four sloops which from time to time serve in the Persian Gulf, we will take up the matter with the Government of/of India, with a view to obtaining the necessary information from them. We may, I suspect, ultimately come to this for, while the precis of Treaties will carry the 5.N.O. or his subordinates a long way, there is always the risk that in some emergency they may be referred to a specific article of a particular Treaty which is not available to them.

With reference to Article 1607 of the Eaat Indies Station Order Book it is submitted that there is only one set of the Truoial Treaties available in the ships of the Persian Gulf Division and this is the Senior Officers set. Commanding Officers therefore are merely able to borrow the set when in company with the Senior Officer and at other times have to rely upon their memories. If an Officer in the course of actual duty had need to refer to the Treaties it is most unlikely that he would be in company with the Senior Officer and, without the treaties, he would be acting with a severe handicap and could not reasonably be relied upon to act in accordance with the terms of the treaties. It is therefore submitted that a set may be supplied to each Commanding Officer. 2. The set in the S.^.O f s.

His Maiestv’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion The attitude adopted at the time by His Majesty’s Government towards this undertaking .s iliustrated by the following extract from India 0 ce lettei dated the ^Oth October 1911 to the Foreign Office “ The term p. 1446 /m good offices ... is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it m neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty s Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression will moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.” (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900 to pi 0 J 11 bit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (d) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giving His Majesty’s Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit.

In the ninth, the British Government promised that “ the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs Ac and his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and his heirs after him ... . rioTE, The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. It does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3138 75 10.28 A »■ ■-V r . • • 7 (/) Pearl fishing and Oil. —The Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. He gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. (g) Letter dated 3rd November 1914 from the Political Resident to the Sheikh, in which the Sheikh was given, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, certain assurances of which the third was that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (7i) The undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak were renewed in 1917 to his son Jabir, and again, on his accession, to the latter’s successor, his brother Salim. To Salim, who proved troublesome, Government in 1918 gave a warning that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour. (See Memorandum on Koweit on page gg, para. 20.) (i) In a Kharita delivered on 19th July 1921 the Viceroy renewed to the present Sheikh, Ahmad al Jabir, nephew of Salim, the assurances given to the latter. Aitchison, Vol. p. 172. Do., p. 178. Do., p. 158. Do., p. 159. Do., p. 162. Do., p. 163. BAHREIN. xii, (a) In 1820 the Ruler of Bahrein subscribed to the general treaty with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, which prescribed abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from slave traffic, and from inter-tribal war, and peace with the British Government. (The adherence of Bahrein to this treaty gave the British Government a formal right to intervene, as it did in 1863, between Bahrein, Abu Dhabi and Katr, and again in 1867-9.) (6) In 1817 the Sheikh of Bahrein subscribed to an engagement for the abolition of slave trade in his ports and for the submission of Bahreini vessels to search by British cruisers for slaves, and to seizure if guilty, and in 1856 signed a further engagement for the better suppression of the slave trade. (c) On the 31st May 1861 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa signed on behalf of himself and his heirs and successors a “perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government.” In Article 2 he agreed to abstain from maritime aggression, war, piracy and slavery by sea “ so long as I receive the support of the British Govern ment in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf.” In Article 3 he undertook to refer to the arbitration of the Political Resident cases of aggression by sea on Bahrein or Bahreinis and to refrain from retaliation without the Political Resident’s assent. “ And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury ... by sea upon Bahrein or . . . its dependencies.” (d) On 22nd December 1880 Sheikh Isa signed an agreement binding himself and his successors not to enter into negotiations with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the British Government, and to prevent the establishment of diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots, other than British, without the consent of the British Government. “This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.” (c) On the 13th March 1892 Sheikh Isa signed a further agreement the first two articles of which reaffirmed his undertaking to abstain from relations with foreign Governments; in the third article he undertook “ on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.” p. 711 / 98 . (/) In 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory.I ft F V f i f t S d n »r ig or 3 I 1 ar he dly iess the •01a , 00 k tion the (g) In 1911 the feheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Office in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing concession to foreigners. In 1914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give_ others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India. EL-KATR. (a) In 1868, as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and'continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed an agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly in disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (b) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1913 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of “ le Sandjuk Ottoman de Nedjd ” should be a “ une ligne partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant face a Pile de Zahnounie (i.e. the Bay of Salwa to the west of £1 Katr) qui ira directement an sud jusqu’au Ruba’-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu'-ile de PEl-Katr.” Further, it was agreed that “ le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique—ne permettra pas an cheikh de Bahrein de s’immiscer dans les affaires interieures d’el-Katr, de porter atteinte a Pautonomie de ce pays 011 de Pannexer.” (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various engagements concluded by the Trucial Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to ■observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. In Articles IV and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to •cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. In Articles VII, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British post and telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in Articles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, his subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being unprovoked by the Sheikh or his subjects. Note. —From para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. || it will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in 1922 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event of an attack by Ibn Sand, he was informed that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-ul-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain). (a) In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea. and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) w r ar; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport of slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; “and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.” * * “ Them ” in the context appears to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs : but it may mean the Chiefs.

(b) In 1828, 1830 and 1847 agreements were entered into by these Chiefs- for the suppression of slave trade, and for the search and, if necessary, seizure by British warships of any of their vessels suspected of engaging in this trade. (c) In 1843 a Maritime 'Truce for ten years was signed by these Chiefs “ being fully impressed with a sense of the evil consequences arising from our subjects and dependents being prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery without interruption on the banks, owing to the various feuds existing among ourselves ” This Truce cancelled the right of the Chiefs, implied in the general Treaty of 1820, to wage regular war on each other. Under the Truce they agreed to refer disputes and cases of aggression to the decision of the Political Resident. In 1853 the Truce was renewed in perpetuity. (d) In 1892 exclusive agreements were signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, that they will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the consent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence in their territories of the agent of any other Government; and that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage,, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territories, save to the British Government. (e) In 1902 the Chiefs undertook to prohibit the importation of arms into,, and their exportation from their territories. (/) In 1911 the Sheikhs undertook not to give pearling or sponge fishing- concessions, save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. (g) In 1922 similar undertakings were given regarding oil. Aitehison, Vol. XII, p. 207. OMAN (MUSCAT). (i) Treaties and Agreements with Great Britain. (a) Treaty relations date from 1798, when an agreement was made by the Imam with the East India Company to exclude the French and Dutch from his territories “ whilst warfare shall continue between the English Company and them.” (b) In 1822 a Treaty for Suppression of the Slave Trade was signed, providing inter alia for action by the Imam’s officers in Muscat territory, and for seizure, outside certain limits, by the British of any vessels carrying slaves to Christian countries. (c) In 1839 a Commercial Treaty was concluded on a reciprocal most favoured-nation basis, providing for the purchase, sale or hire of lands by British subjects in Muscat territory, appointment of Consuls, protection of Muscat subjects in British employ, extraterritoriality for British subjects, unrestricted trade, limitation of import duties to 5 per cent, and freedom from export duties. (d) In 1839 and 1845 further enactments reinforced the right of British vessels to detain and search and if necessary confiscate Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves, outside certain limits. (e) In 1862 an Anglo-French Declaration was signed under which the French Government and Her Majesty’s Government engaged reciprocallv to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. (/) In 1864 the Sultan agreed to permit the construction of, and to protect, one or more telegraph lines in his own territories or in those leased by him from Persia. But no sovereign right was to be conferred on the British Government over any such territory. This was followed in 1865 by a similar convention in respect of His Highness’ territories in Arabia and Mekran. (g) In 1873 a further Treaty for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was concluded. _ This extended the powers of seizure possessed by British vessels to include seizure of Muscat vessels trading between Muscat ports- the Sultan undertook to shut all slave markets in his dominions and to protect liberated slaves. (/&gt;-) In 1891 a new Treaty of Commerce, Friendship and Navigation was concluded, which cancelled the Treaty of 1839, but was framed on similar lines. Coals, provisions, &amp;c., for Her Majesty’s ships were to be exempt from duty (Art. 6). No export duties were to be levied without the consent of Her Majesty’s Government. This treaty, like that of 1839, provided a capitulatory regime for British subjects. r f(i) In 1891 an agreement was also signed by the Sultan, pledging him ne\ei to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give in occupation any of his dominions or dependencies, save to the British Government. (j) I 11 1895 a guarantee was given to the Sultan that, whatever the differences between the Sheikhs of Oman and the Sultan, Government would 1 not allow the former to attack the two towns of Muscat and Mattrah. The Sultan issued a notification m these terms. The warning was renewed in 1913. (k) In 1898 a proclamation was issued giving British and Persian vessels the right to search British, Persian or Muscat vessels in Muscat waters, and Muscat vessels in British or Persian waters, for arms and ammunition. (?) In 1902 the Sultan undertook to grant His Majesty's Government the first option on mining rights in the Sur coalfields. ^/?0 In 1903 the Sultan issued a notification authorising the searching by British and Italian ships, both on the high seas and in Muscat waters, of Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms to certain prohibited African areas. (n) In 1923 the Sultan undertook not to give any oil concession without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. (ii) Treaties with other Powers. (а) In 1833 the Sultan concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States of America providing for perpetual peace, unrestricted trading (except that muskets and ammunition might not be sold to private persons in Zanzibar), limitation of import duties to 5 per cent., reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to trading charges, and appointment of consuls. (б) In 1844 a Treaty of Commerce was concluded with France in terms almost identical with the British Treaty of 1839. (c) In 1877 a short Treaty with Holland provided reciprocal most-favoured nation treatment for the nationals of each country, both generally and in respect of import duty and the regulations regarding export and transit. SUMMARY. 1. The following are common to the engagements of all the above Arab States to the British Government:— The undertaking not to cede, sell, mortgage, &amp;c., any of their territory except to the British Government, or to give any oil concession without permission.

MEMORANDUM ON .an Ul BRITISH COMMITMENTS (DURING THE WAR) TO THE GULF CHIEFS. THE name “ Gulf Chiefs ” is used to include a number of independent or autonomous Arab rulers—the Sultan of Maskat, the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, and the Sheikhs of Katar, Bahrein, Koweit, and Mohammerah—with whom His Majesty's Government have treaty relations, and who are dealt with by the Government of India through the British Resident in the Persian Gulf (Bushire) and the local political agents under his authority. For our relations with the Gulf Chiefs before the war, it is sufficient to refer to the Foreign Office memorandum of the 12th February, 1908, respecting British interests in the Persian Gulf; to the appendices to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913 (in which we communicated to the Turkish Government all our agreements with the Gulf Chiefs, except the Secret Agreement of the 16th October, 1907); and to the draft of a despatch, dated August 1914, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, reviewing the course of negotiations and agreements concluded in 1913 and 1914 regarding affairs of Turkey and the Persian Gulf. During the war certain fresh assurances and pledges have been given to the Gulf Chiefs, collectively and individually, by His Majesty’s Government, and these are discussed below. (i.) Collective Assurances* In August 1914, after war had broken out between Great Britain and Germany, and Turkey had begun to display an intention of intervening on the German side, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf ^appears to have] suggested fto the Government of India that circular letters to the Gulf Chiefs ought to be drafted in advance, to be despatched the moment a state of war between Great Britain and Turkey came into existence. On the 6th September, 1914, the Government of India communicated to the Resident the text of a draft circular communique on the responsibility of Turkey for the outbreak of war, as well as suggestions for specific assurances to the more important of the Chiefs, which they were submitting to the India Office (61684/61439/14, No. 1). On the 14th September, 1914, the officiating Resident (64214/14, No. 1) submitted to the Government of India drafts of various notices, based on the drafts and sugges tions previously communicated to him, which he proposed to issue in the event of war occurring. These drafts contained both individual and collective assurances. The former will be dealt with separately later. The latter were embodied in the following passage of a “ Special Notice to be issued on the outbreak of war to the Arab rulers and sheikhs in the Persian Gulf and their subjects”:— 1Ai laj &lt;it&gt; '/ “ Your relations with Great Britain are of long standing, and I take the opportunity of assuring you that in this struggle we shall do our utmost to preserve for you your liberty and religion. No act of ours shall threaten either of these, which are dearer to humanity than life itself.” Under the same cover, the Resident submitted to the Government of India the draft of a circular proclamation regarding the Holy Places — “ From the High British Government. “ War has broken out between Great Britain and Turkey, but it is notified for the public information of all the Moslems that, so long as the Indian pilgrims proceeding to Mecca and Medina are not seriously interfered with, no hostile action will be taken by the British or Indian Government, or by their ships or soldiers, against the port of Jeddah or the Holy Places.” [972] B •it \ In a telegram dated the 26th September, 1914 (64214/14, No. 12), the Government of India approved these two drafts, with the addition of a Holy Places in Mesopotamia.-^ And on the 6th October, 1914 (66.836/14, N . /), _ 7 _ informed the Resident that the issue of assurances on the lines suggested m e r , previous telegram of the 6th September, 1914, had been approved provisionally by HlS InTotHh^rtefelrams the Resident was instructed not to despatch any of the approved documents until final instructions to that effect were 8 ® n * . 'J?; Accordingly, on the 1st November, 1914, when a state of war between Great Britain and Turkey had already existed for two days, he telegraphed to the govern of India for permission (82713/14, p. 7). On the 2 nd_November,1914, the Govern- ment informed him that permission was implied m certain previous telegrams o (p. 8), and on receipt of this authorisation he appears immediately to have telegiaphed instructions for the delivery of the messages to the local residents at the courts o le various chiefs (p. 17). The assurances therefore bear date of tbe 3rd November, 1914. (ii.) Assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, The Sheikh of Mohammerah’s authority extends over the port of Mohammerah (on the Karun Biver near its confluence with the Shatt-al-Arab), the naviga e sec ion of the Karun up to Ahwaz, and the Arab tribes in the neighbourhood of the river. He is nominally a Persian subject, but it is many years since the Government at Tehran has exercised effective authority over him, or indeed over the other nominal y Persian territories (Luristan, Bakhtiari-land, Kashgai-land, &amp;c.) that border on his dominions. The competent administration of the Sheikh in these dominions has been in marked contrast to the surrounding disorder. i* i j * j- Commercial relations between Great Britain and Mohammerah are of old standing, and have given rise to political relations between His Majesty’s Government and bhei Khazal since the beginning of the present century. + British interests at Mohammerah were vastly increased by the concession accorded by the ^ Persian Government to Mr. W. K. d’Arcy in 1901, and taken up by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909. The oil-fields on which the Company concentrated its activities lay north-east o t e Karun, on the borders of Sheikh Khazal’s country and Bakhtiari-land, and the natural access from the sea was across Mohammerah territory. The Company an agree ment with the Sheikh in 1909, and laid a pipe line from the fields to Mohammerah port. The fields proved so productive that by an agreement signed on the 20th ay, 1914, His Majesty’s Government acquired a predominant interest in the Company, an greatly increased the scale of its operations. Since that date His Majesty s Govern ment’s relations with Mohammerah have been of direct importance for the supply o oil fuel to the British Navy. . M , i rj- In view of these closer relations, which began in 1909, the Sheikh asked His Majesty’s Government for more definite political assurances than they had previously given him (29456/24869/14). He was particularly anxious about a dynastic guarantee, and about the safeguarding of his position vis-d-vis the Persian^ Government and foreign Powers other than Great Britain. After due consideration of his detailed proposals, his request was met by the following statement, which was communicated to him in writing on the 15th October, 1910, by Sir P. Cox, the British Besident in the Persian Gulf, together with the insignia of a K.C.I.E. :— “ I am authorised to inform your Excellency that, whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, whether it be Koyalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you ^ the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of ^ an encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. “ In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such a Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia.” [In giving these two assurances, Colonel Cox was to add a verbal explanation to the effect that, while His Majesty’s Government were perfectly sincere in their intentions towards the Sheikh, and had, therefore, given him these * “ After words ‘ Mecca and Medina ’ in the Proclamation, add words Mesopotamia,’ and instead of ‘ Holy Places,’ say at the end ‘ said Holy Places. or the Holy Places in f See Report, dated December 7th, 1913, by Sir P. Cox in 29456/24869/14.assurances, yet circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible to intervene by force on his behalf. In such a case he would, of course, receive the strongest diplomatic support. Colonel Cox was to record in writing the substance of the conversation, in the course of which this intimation was made to the Sheikh.] “ These assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your male descendants, so long as you or they shall not have failed to observe your obbgations towards the Central Government, and shall continue to be accept able to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them.” A version of this statement was also handed to the Sheikh (at his express request) for communication to his tribesmen. It differed from the other in the omission of the words “to be acceptable to your tribesmen” from the last paragraph, and in the fact that it was not accompanied by the verbal explanation. On the 8th December, 1910, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired whether there was any truth in information which had reached him that the Sheikh was under British protection. The British Minister at Tehran replied that the Sheikh was not a British-protected person, but that His Majesty’s Government had special relations with him, and would support him in the event of any encroachment on his rights. It was decided by the Foreign Office that no further information should be conveyed to the Persian Government regarding the Sheikh’s relations with His Majesty’s Government. On the llh December, 1913, at a time when His Majesty’s Government were contemplating the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Sheikh Khazal asked Sir P. Cox for still further assurances on the following lines (29456/14):— (1.) That we would make the position regarding the succession more secure by a modification of the wording of our assurances. (2.) That we would, now that peace had been made between the Bakhtiaris and himself, take cognisance of a definite compact of peace between them which would render him immune from the necessity and expense of collecting a large army annually each season for the protection of his territory against their aggression. (3.) That we should endeavour to devise and take measures with the Persian Government, and in such directions as may be politically possible, to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which the history of the past entitled him, and which he at present enjoys in practice, but on a precarious basis. In a report, dated the 7th December, 1913, to the Government of India Sir P. Cox conveyed these requests, and submitted that— “ we should meet the Sheikh’s wishes as far as we can in the matter of the wording of our assurance to him, and that in-stead of the words ‘ and be acceptable to your tribesmen,’ we should substitute the words, ‘and provided always that the nomination of your successor from among your descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty’s Government.’ ” He proposed to meet Sheikh KhazaTs other requests by negotiating on certain lines with the Bussian and Persian Governments. The points raised in this report were still being discussed between the India Office and the Foreign Office when the outbreak of the war transformed the situation. The disintegration of Persia and the encroachment of Russia, which had previously been the main preoccupation of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, were eclipsed by the more immediate menace from Turkey and Germany. The Sheikh of Mohammerah appears to have sent assurances of his loyalty to His Majesty’s Government soon after a state of war between Great Britain and Germany was declared (61684/61439/14, No. 1), and it was clearly essential that we should reaffirm and 'strengthen our assurances to him. On the 6th September, 1914, the Government of India, in a telegram to the India Office repeated to the officiating Resident in the Gulf (61684/14, No. 1), made the following suggestion :— “ It is asserted by the Sheikh of Koweit, and there seem reasonable grounds to believe, that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in collusion with certain4 notables of Basra with whom they are in close touch, and with the distant co-operation of Bin Saud, could (if given certain assurances) either prepare the way for our peaceful occupation of Basra, or, until we were in a position to take effective action, arrange to keep the place quiet and isolated. “ To the Sheikh of Mohammerah we should give the assurance already sanctioned in connection with recent grant of decoration; undertaking to maintain him in secure and untaxed possession of his date gardens on the Turkish side of the river, and perhaps a promise to do our best vis-d-vis Persia to maintain him in his present state of local autonomy.” In accordance with this, the officiating Besident submitted to the Government of India on the 14th September, 1914, the following draft of a special letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, together with drafts of other notices (discussed in section (1) above), to be despatched in the event of war between Great Britain and Turkey breaking out (64214/14 : No. 1):— “ I am authorised by my Government to request your Excellency to co-operate with our honoured friends, their Excellencies the Amir of Nejd and the Sheikh of Koweit, in the capture of Basra from the Turks .... “ In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government to assure your Excellency that in the event of our success—and succeed we shall, insha Allah—Basra will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. “ I am further to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this writing, that, whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Boyalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Central Government (provided always that the nomination of your successors from among your descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with and the approval of His Majesty’s Government), and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. “Vis- d-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. “ Further, your date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs, and for ever immune from taxation.” This draft was approved by the Government of India on the 26th September, 1914 (64214/14, No. 12), with the substitution of the words “ date gardens which you now possess” for “ your date gardens ” in the last paragraph, and the omission of the words “ for ever.” In this emended form the letter was eventually delivered to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914. Later, after the occupationof Basra, Sheikh Khazal asked that the wording of the letter should be revised again. “ These assurances, in the form originally sanctioned by Government, con tained a reference to the co-operation expected from the Sheikh in the event of its being needed in connection with the capture of Basra. The Sheikh urged that as occasion did not arise for the fulfilment of this obligation, it seemed somewhat inconvenient and superfluous for it to be mentioned in a communication which would become an important permanent record; he therefore begged for a revised letter from which the passages relating to Basra should be omitted.”* Accordingly Sir P. Cox, after obtaining the approval of the Viceroy, sent the following document to Sheikh Khazal, dating it 22rd November, 1914, being the date, on which Basra was occupied by the British forces :— With reference to the assurances conveyed to your Excellency in my letter dated the 15th October, 1910 (= 11th Shawwal, v 1328), and having regard to the fuither valued services and co-operation which your Excellency has rendered to Letter, dated Basra, 1st April, 1915, from Sir P. Cox to Government of India, in 62555/15.the British Government and British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab, ' '* I am now authorised to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, and whether it be Bnyalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will he prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution, both to yourself and to us, in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government, pro vided always that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of. His Majesty’s Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. “ Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. “ Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs, and immune from taxation. “ P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General for Fars, dec.” Towards the end of the year 1915, when it appeared probable for a time that Persia would intervene in the war on the side of the enemy, there was some discussion on the question of recognising Sheikh Khazal’s independence in this event, and a line of procedure was sketched out by Sir P. Cox in telegrams dated the 1st November, 1915 (163390/161734/15), and the 14th November, 1915 (171916/161734/15). But since the contingency never, in fact, occurred, the assurance of the 22nd November, 1914, has remained the final embodiment, up to the present date, of His Majesty’s Government’s commitments to the Sheikh of Moliammerah. (hi ) Assurances to the Sheikh of Koweit. Koweit became of vital interest to Great Britain when it was proposed to prolong the Bagdad Bailway, as a German concern, to a deep-water port on the Persian Gulf Before the outbreak of the war, His Majesty’s Government’s relations with the Sheikh of Koweit were based upon the secret agreements concluded with him in 1899 and 1907, and the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913. By the terms of the latter, the Sheikh was recoguised as Kaimakam of an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire ; the boundaries of his immediate territory and his wider tribal jurisdiction were delimited ; the Ottoman Government recognised existing agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government; and His Majesty’s Government undertook, on their part, not to alter the nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit, or to establish a protectorate there, so long as the status quo, as defined in the Convention, underwent no change. On the 8th August, 1914, Sheikh Mubarak was informed officially by the officiating Besident in the Persian Gulf that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Germany (61684/61439/14, No. 12). On the 21st August, 1914, in an interview with the British Besident at Koweit, he made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty’s Government on behalf of himself and his tribes, placed “ his efforts, his men, and his ships ” at Great Britain’s disposal, and expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrisons from the islands at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, which he claimed as lawfully his. He repeated this declaration in a letter, of the same date, to the officiating Besident in the Gulf, which was formally acknowledged by the latter on the 25th August, 1914.j[~ In view of the increasing likelihood that Turkey would intervene in the war on Germany’s side, it became clear that His Majesty’s Government’s previous undertakings to the Sheikh of Koweit would have to be renewed, and contingently extended, against the event of a state of war arising between Great Britain and Turkey. [972J di &lt;16 VP-fi. fcjtz P. ft- #$14* *1*^ c6 On the 6th September, 1914, the Government of India, in a telegram referred to already in section (ii), made the following suggestion^ 1684/14, No. 1) :— “ It is asserted by the Sheikh of Koweit, and there seem reasonable grounds to believe, that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in collusion with certain notables of Basra, with whom they are in close touch, and with the distant co-operation of Bin Saud, could (if given certain assurances) either prepare the way for our peaceful occupation of Basra, or, until we are in a position to take eftective action, arrange to keep the place quiet and isolated. “ To secure these results I would offer the following inducements, in addition to the assurance that Basra would never again be subjected to Turkish authority. “ To the Sheikh of Koweit, we should offer full possession and immunity from taxation for his date gardens on the Turkish bank between Fao and Gurnah ; immunity from the consequences of ejecting the present small Turkish military posts from Safwan, Umm Kasr, and Bubiyan ; and thereafter recognition under British protection of independent principality of Koweit.” # On the 14th September, 1914, the officiating Resident in the Gulf submitted to ^ the Government of India a draft of a special letter to the Sheikh of Koweit, together i . with other drafts referred to above in sections (i) and (ii) (642f4/14, No. 1):— “ In return for the valuable co-operation which we expect from you, I am authorised by the Government in the event of success—and, insha Allah, we shall succeed—to assure you that Basra will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. “ I am further to give your Excellency personally the following special assurances :— t ”“'' 1/'“’ f “(1.) Your date gardens between Fao and Gurnah shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and for ever be immune from taxation. “ (2.) You are guaranteed by the great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr, and Bubiyan. “ (3.) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” This draft, like the others, was approved by the Government of India on the 26th September, 1914 (64214/14, No. 12), with the same alterations in assurance (1), regarding the Sheikh’s date gardens in the Basra vilayet, as were made in the corresponding passage in the draft special letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The letter, in its emended form, was eventually despatched on the 3rd November, 1914. On the 28th February, 1917, upon the death of Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Subah, these undertakings were renewed in the “Kharita” to his son; and after, the latter had also died and had been succeeded by his brother, Sheikh Salim-bin-Mubarak, the Government of India forwarded to Sir P. Cox, for presentation to the new ruler, a “Kharita” from the Viceroy renewing to him likewise the undertakings which His Majesty’s Government had made to his father (68308/34912/17). During the first half of the year 1918 Sheikh Salim created considerable difficulties for His Majesty’s Government over the question of the control of the blockade in Koweit territories and ports. And, in this connection, the following message was conveyed to him through the Resident at Koweit on the 5th July, 1918 (121490/ 49888/18) “ Government have deeply regretted the events of the last two years at Koweit, but they welcome your declarationf as affording an opportunity for re-establishment of our traditional friendship. In order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future, they desire to explain their policy towards your Excellency. “ On the one hand, should you show to Government same friendship and assistance which they have experienced for many years in their dealings with the rulers of Koweit, they will continue to you the assurances given to your illustrious father, the late Sheikh Mubarak, especially that ‘ the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,’| and will extend to you the friendship and protection and assistance which they gave to him;.and, finally, they hope that you will raise * “ It is a question whether we should not hoist British flag- at Koweit as soon after declaration of war as we are in a position to protect it from Turkish attack.—P.

A. 1 °! :her it is the plain duty of ruler of a State which is on terms of friendship with Government to prevent all acts, either by his own sub jects or by other persons in his territory, which may be contrary to interests of ovemment; and since they know that, if you wish to do so, you have the power , to y° l ™ su }d ects and others in your territory, Government will be compelled to hold your Bxpeliency personally responsible should any such act unfortunately e committed m future. They hope your Excellency will fully realise your responsibility as the ruler of Koweit towards Government under whose protection and friendship Koweit has so greatly prospered in the past, and will understand that prosperity depends entirely on preservation of true friendship, both in word and deed, with Government.” This appears to be the most recent statement made on the part of His Majesty’s Government with regard to their relations with Koweit. (iv.) Treaty with the Sheikh of al-Katar. - fr L o^ G, */, TTndei Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, the Turks renounced i all their pretensions in the Peninsula of al-Katar, which lay east of the line laid downo* m the Convention as the eastern boundary of the “ Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd.” This cleaied up the situation in the al-Katar country, which had been obscure since the establishment of a Turkish military post there in 1872, and on the 15th July, ' the India Office telegraphed to the Viceroy (33406/1990/14) suggesting that the time was approaching when a treaty should be concluded with the new Sheikh*' (ke., Abdidlah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani), and asking for definite proposals as soon as possible. On the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, Sheikh Abdullah- bin-Jasim was informed thereof officially by the officiating Resident in the'Persian Gulf (66597/1990/14), and returned a satisfactory reply?' Butina despatch to the fffylta. Government of India, dated the 1st September, 1914, the officiating Resident drev attention to the fact that Sheikh Abdullah was not effective ruler of the country, anc submitted that, while it was in His Majesty’s Government’s interest to assist him to become so, the immediate conclusion of a treaty would be premature. It does not appear whether this despatch reached the Government of India before they drafted the telegram of suggestions, dated the 6 th September, 1914(61684/61439/14), which has been referred to several times above, and in which the question of al-Katar was discussed as follows :— “ As regards, the Sheikh of Katar, it is probable that he could not and would not evict the Turkish garrison .without active support from us, but their ejection in the event of war would be a simple matter, and if the Sheikh were first informed, and given an assurance that his position and privileges as ruling Sheikh of Katar would be thereafter recognised and maintained by us, we should doubtless have his co-operation in effecting their bloodless expulsion.” No special letter to Sheikh Abdullah was included among the drafts submitted by the officiating Resident in the Gulf on the 14th September, 1914, presumably for the reasons advanced in his despatch of the 1st September, 1914, and in a telegram dated the 6th October, 1914, to the Government of India (69321/61439/14, No. 3)f he dealt 'f PtfltZ/fA with the point as follows :— 1 /' r. “ Assurance to Sheikh of Katar is the only point about which I am doubtful. Hitherto I have regarded Sheikh of Katar as a factor to be neglected when interests of far greater importance are pressing, and my proposal was merely to furnish usual notification, which has been issued toother Gulf chiefs, to Sheikh Abdullah. Katar sheikhs, in view of their present internal quarrels, are quite unable to turn out existing Turkish garrison, which is quite isolated and innocuous. Kindly iostruct me accordingly if you consider that anything further is required. “ In absence of specific instructions it is clearly understood that I take no action.” The officiating Resident’s view appears to have been adopted by the Government of India, and no special commitments were entered into towards the Sheikh of Katar * In 1868 a fairly loose agreement on trucial lines had been concluded with the then Sheikh, but His Majesty’s Government had refused to renew it during the Turkish occupation of the post of al-Bidaa.^ ^wrisiu; I! fUS&gt;l’ r i ^ L on the occasion of the outbreak of war between Great B ' ta “\ J^eikh course of the year 1915 however the question of concjudi g * (Political draft treaty was ready for presentation to the Shei i. ^ ^ ^ tli , utW sh.i S AM*h:. c a« = i» 1868.

I woul welcome them gladly myself, but my people are not yet sufficiently civilised nor is my rule sufficiently consolidated, and I am afraid of serious trouble, which could only end in my own destruction, if I allowed foreigners m now. You may add, howe\ei that this is only a temporary difficulty which I hope rem0V f e ’ r a f ^ I promise, if Government will allow clauses IY, Y, and YIII to stand over for the * the headquarters of the several Chiefs on the one side, and at the British Residency at Bushire ' on the other. tpossible 5 ^° COnS ^ er a g a in later and to accept them at as early a date as + i ^ s instruct ions, the Resident at Koweit was unable to carry i cn ia 1 T )n ?i Ur , tl ! 1 er °. n own illative, but in his report, dated the 26th October, lalo, he made the following recommendations : “ In consideration of the Sheikh’s remarks given above, and the fact that the posi ion is much as stated by him, I am disposed to recommend that the Govern- men o ru la may be pleased to accept the explanation of his inability to admit 1 r erS ln ^° 118 ( ^ om ^ n ^ ons l' or fl 16 present, and to negotiate the remainder ? la ^ treaty on^ the understanding that a subsidiary agreement regarding aV u ^i^ 1 ? ses .i^ made subsequently. I am convinced that Sheikh Abdullah will abide loyally by the engagements into which he is now prepared to er h e f’ anc ^ ^ believe that practical experience of our encouragement and support will increase his reliance on us, which is really all that is necessary. It is quite possible that, should we decline to treat with him without these c auses, he might ultimately agree to their inclusion under protest, but, unless it is considered that there is any urgency in regard either to the admission of traders, or a British agent, or both, the acceptance for the present of the Sheikh’s explan ations will pay us best in the long run, as it will, in my opinion, be more likely to wm his confidence and regard. I am averse, generally speaking, from coercive measures with Arab chiefs, except m cases of obvious breaches of engagements.” Sir P. Cox, in a report dated the 17th April, 1916, to the Government of India, proposed to meet the case in another way :— / I would recommend another attempt to get the treaty signed without alter ation, m order to keep it in line with those in force in the case of the other Sheikhs in treaty with us, but I think we might give Sheikh Abdullah a separate letter at the same time, explaining that it was important to have the treaty worded on the same lines as others, but assuring him that we have no intention at present of pressing for fulfilment of articles 4, 5, and 8. As long as our right in each of these respects is clearly enunciated, I think we can afford to reserve them for the present for the reason that, if trade and harbour facilities progress at Bahrein, as they are doing, the trade for the greater part of the Katar peninsula will depend upon Bahrein, when we shall have practical control over it. As regards article 6 of the general treaty, I a‘m of opinion that it would be best for Sheikh Abdullah to sign the treaty as a whole, but with the reservation above the signature in regard to the above article that he does not subscribe to article 6.” The Viceroy, in a telegram to the India Office dated the 2nd June, 1916 /&gt; (107294/16), suggested that Sheikh Abdullah’s objections should be acceded to. if 1 necessary:— “ Articles to which Sheikh takes exception are of no great importance at present time, and by accepting remaining articles Sheikh undertakes to do practically all that we immediately require. We therefore propose to authorise Cox to negotiate treaty on lines acceptable to Sheikh, should he find any difficulty in securing Sheikh s acceptance of articles to which he now objects. W'e consider it more important to secure a reasonably satisfactory treaty than run the risk of a breakdown of negotiations by insisting on conclusion of a treaty on all fours with other trucial treaties. Kindly telegraph your approval.” ' / 3d // b This suggestion was approved by the India Office (125270/16), with the con currence of the Foreign Office (120978/16)rrn a telegram dated the 27th June, 1916. I Zv Accordingly the Government of India telegraphed to Sir P. Cox on the 29th June, 1916 (164214/16), that he should resume negotiations with Sheikh Abdullah on the suggested lines, with the special instruction that article 3 of the draft, providing for the importation of arms, should be framed more strictly. , Sir P. Cox proceeded in due course to Katar and carried the negotiations to a conclusion (15720/17)- The text of the treaty, as it was eventually signed by him and Sheikh Abdullah at A1 Bidaa on the 3rd November, 1916yls printed in Appendix A to V [972] D• ’• 'Vv»» • 1 •' !,V •' 10 the present memorandum. In this text article 3 of the original draft, relating to the arms traffic, was made more stringent, while, as a concession to Sheikh Abdullah, article 6 was altered so as to apply to British merchandise only, and not to ^iBsh traders. Articles 7, 8, and 9 (corresponding respectively to articles 4 and 8 oi the draft), were left as they stood, but in a letter from Sir R Cox to Sheikh Abdullah (Appendix B), of the same date as the treaty, it was agreed, m the name ol His Majesty s Government, that they should remain in suspense for an unspecified period._ It was also agreed that, notwithstanding article 9 of the treaty of 1820 with the Trucial Chiets, to which he had now subscribed, Sheikh Abdullah and his subjects should be allowed^ to retain negro slaves already in their possession^ on condition of their treatment being satisfactory. In pursuance of article 3, Sheilfh Abdullah signed the draft proclamation regarding the arms traffic (Appendix C), and issued it, on the same date, in his own name. On the 4th November, 1916, Sir P. Cox forwarded to the Government of India the texts of the treaty as signed, of his own letter to Sheikh Abdullah, and of Sheikh Abdullah’s proclamation, together with a full report on the negotiations. In a telegram to the India Office, dated the 10th January, 1917, the Viceroy proposed that- the &gt; ^M'7 treaty should be ratified (25485/15720/17)t and the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office (25485/17), signified its approval in a telegram dated the 13th p February, 1917 (35527/17)t The signed copy of the treaty was accordingly returned ^ fWtllJ to Sir P. Cox by the -fedkcdQffic^with three parchment copies of the English version, /' T and he was' instructed to have the Arabic version reproduced on the margins of these copies, to sign them himself, and to obtain the signature of Sheikh Abdullah. These instructions appear to have been duly carried out, and the treaty was ratified on the 23rd March, 1918, by the Government of India. f~ ^ Relation of Commitments {during the War) to the Gulf Chiefs to British T)esiderata a PHIS r if#! There would appear to be no serious conflict between the two. The general collective assurance merely reaffirms, in the vaguest terms, our previous undertakings to the various chiefs. The general assurance regarding British policy towards the Holy Places, including those in Mesopotamia, is in no way at variance with British interests or with commit ments entered into on the same subject with other parties by His Majesty’s Government. The assurance, given to the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit, that Basra should never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority, is practically identical with the assurances subsequently given to the notables of Basra Vilayet by Sir P. Cox, and again by the Viceroy of India in a speech delivered at Basra on the 3rd February, 1915. It is also consistent with our pledge to King Husein that Basra shall be included within the boundaries of Arab independence, while, unlike the latter pledge, it leaves His Majesty’s Government a completely free hand in regard to the positive disposal of Basra, so long as a restoration of Turkish sovereignty is excluded. The special assurance to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, of which the final text is contained in Sir P. Cox’s communication dated the 22nd November, 1914, is for the most part a repetition, practically word for word, of the assurance of 1910, with the impor tant exception that, in the dynastic guarantee, the stipulation that the Sheikh’s successors must be acceptable to the tribesmen as well as to His Majesty’s Government is omitted. There are also two short additional clauses, and the. first of these makes our under taking to support the Sheikh’s established rights vis-d-vis the Persian Government more definite, and introduces the word “ autonomy.” In effect it would make jt morally incumbent upon His Majesty’s Government to interfere in case the Sheikh’s rights were violated by Tehran; but no doubt we should in any case take action, in such circum stances, in our own interests, and the assurance does not commit us to take specific action, or to carry our action further than we may think desirable at the time. The most important point is that none of our commitments to the Sheikh of Mohammerah are inconsistent with a loyal recognition of Persia’s integrity. The second additional clause, regarding the Sheikh’s date gardens in what was formerly Turkish territory, is a comparatively trifling matter; and since the immunity from taxation is not specifically accorded in perpetuity, it could presumably be modified if it became a grave embarrassment to Basra finances. The special assurance to the Sheikh of Koweit leaves the previous relations between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government unaffected, and merely commits us to the abolition of Turkish suzerainty over him. This suzerainty was, of course, objectionable from the British point of view, and was in effect an anomaly, since our11 ie ah, ish the. A lah 1 y’s Jso to to ; n g 'on 36. lia kh am the nee 3th tl-A esel he ms mg lit- nt. n al x, 7* be ive i is lost )or- i’s tent agreements with the Sheikh, which were recognised by the Turkish Government in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, had placed him, with the exception of this Turkish suzerainty, in a “trucial” relationship to His Majesty’s Government. From the trucial point of view, the existing agreements appear satis factory. i&gt;ut if it is desired to modify or amplify them at some future date, this can now ^be done without reference to Turkey. On this head, therefore, the assurance to the Sheikh of Koweit is at least as much in our interest as in his. As regards Safwan, Umm Kasr, and Bubiyan, the guarantee against Turkish reprisals for an attack on the Turkish military posts there on the part of the Sheikh has, of course, been fully redeemed, and is now an obsolete question. The important point is the permanent political ownership of the places referred to. Bubiyan is an island at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and Safwan and Umm Kasr are forts on the mainland just north of it. All three had been in dispute for many years before the war between the Sheikh of Koweit and Turkey. The Anglo-. Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, effected a compromise, assigning Bubiyan Island to the direct territories of the Sheikh, while Safwan and Umm Kasr forts were excluded even from his outer sphere of tribal allegiance, and were assigned to the Turkish vilayet of Basra. Our assurance practically commits us to recognising Sheikh Salim’s sovereignty over Safwan and Umm Kasr, as well as Bubiyan. But since the Sheikh is in a trucial relationship with us, our position at Basra would in no way be injured by this, nor does the possession of these forts by the Sheikh appear to conflict with any other British interest. The assurance regarding the Sheikh’s date gardens is on the same footing as that given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. As regards the treaty with the Sheikh of al-Katar, the only point on which it goes beyond the normal type of “ trucial treaty ” is the undertaking, under article 11, that His Majesty’s Government’s good offices shall be used on the Sheikh’s behalf in the event of unprovoked aggression against him by land. But the assurance is so vague and guarded that it hardly constitutes a serious innovation. dei’' nore ■ally ifere ;um- jcific The lerab was unity lifted'• - &lt;&lt;;&lt;£ hu r&lt; t f &lt;v ;•*.: .r r r.,r- .-» ■ v ;: , .. ll 12 APPENDIX A. Text of Treaty, dated November 3, 1916, and ratified^ on March 23, 1918, with Sheikh Abdullah-bm- Jasim-bin-Thani of al-Katar. Whereas my grandfather, the late Sheikh Mohammed-bin-Thani, signed an agreementjm the 12th September, 1868, engaging not to commit any breach of the maritime peace, and where obligations to the British Government have devolved on me his successor in Qatar, I. I, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, undertake that I will, as do the friendly Arab Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Shargah, Ajman, Ras-ul-Khaima, and Umm-al-Qawam, co-operate with the High British Government in the suppression of the slave trade and piracy, and genera y m e mam em of the maritime peace. _ ., t&gt; - no* To this end, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the treaties and engagements entered into between the Shei s a ove men and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I will abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid treaties and engagements. II. On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that 1 and my subjects and my and their vassals shall receive all the immunities, privileges, and advantages that are conierre on e nen y Sheikhs, their subjects and their vassals. In token whereof, Sir Percy Cox has a xe is signa u with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagemen s m e copy granted to me, and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof o eac an every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements, in two other printed copies of the same rea les an engagements, that it may not be hidden. Hi, ?3r : III. - And in particular, I, Sheikh Abdullah, have further published a proclamation, forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and port of Qatar; and in consideration o t e un er a m t&gt; into which I now enter, the British Government on its part agrees to grant me facilities to purcnase and import, from the Maskat Arms Warehouse, or such other place as the British Government may approve, for my personal use, and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as may reasonably need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter through the political Agent, Bahrein. I undertake absolutely that arms and ammunition thus supplied to me shall under no circumstances be re-exported from my territories or sold to the public, but shall be reserve so e y for supplying the needs of my tribesmen and dependents, whom I have to arm for the mam enance o order in my territories and the protection of my frontiers. In my opinion, the amount o my ear y requirements will be up to five hundred weapons. IV. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond wiih nor receive the agent of, any other Power without the consent of the High British Government, nei er will I, without such consent; cede, to any other Power or its subjects, land, either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, or in any other way whatsoever. Y. I also declare that, without the consent of the High British Government, I will not grant pearl- fishery concessions, or any other monopolies, concessions, or cable landing rights to anyone whomsoever. YI. The customs dues on the goods of British merchants imported to Qatar shall not exceed those levied from my own subjects on their goods, and shall in no case exceed 5 per cent, ad valorem. British goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues or taxes of any other kind whatsoever, beyond that already specified. YII. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further, in particular, undertake to allow British subjects to reside in Qatar for trade and to protect their lives and property. VIII. I also undertake to receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an agent from the British Government, who shall remain at Al-Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me, and to watch over the interests of British traders, residing at my ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions.IX. Further, I undertake to allow the establishment of a British post office and a telegraph installation anywhere in my territory whenever the British Government should hereafter desire them. I also undertake to protect them when established. X. On their part, the High British Government, in consideration of these treaties and engagements that I have entered into with them, undertake to protect me and my subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to do their utmost to exact reparation for all injuries that I, or my subjects, may suffer when proceeding to sea upon our lawful occasions. XL They also undertake to grant me good offices, should I or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar. It is, however, thoroughly understood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part of myself or my subjects against others. In token whereof I, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I, Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, have respectively signed and affixed our seal to this original document and four copies thereof.

(After compliments.) Whereas your Honour has to-day entered into and signed with me, on behalf of the British Government, an agreement or treaty, with the object of cementing the relations between the High British Government and yourself, and whereas your Honour has expressed the opinion that the time has not yet come for giving effect to articles (7), (8), and (9), which relate to :— 1. The admission of British subjects to Qatar for trade. 2. The admission of an agent on behalf of Government. 3. The establishment of post and telegraph offices in your territory. Therefore I, on behalf of the British Government, accept your opinion, and hereby inform you that the British Government sees no present necessity for the execution of these measures, and will refrain from pressing for them until some future time when the need for them shall be manifest, and the effect will not be given to these articles without full consultation with you and the obtaining of your consent. And whereas you have represented to me that you and your dependents possess a good many slaves from of old time, previous to this treaty, and that it would be difficult if the officials of Government were to interfere between them and their masters, accordingly I inform you that I recognise how you are placed in regard to this question, and that supposing that you accord your negroes fair and just treatment there will not be interference on the part of Government repre sentatives in the matter. This is what had to be explained, and may God preserve you. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

With this view the compilation has been subjected to scrutiny in this Department and I am to convey the following remarks thereon :- (a) The English text of all items in the compilation has been checked, so far as possible, with the I text on record and found generally to tally except j that a few verbal divergences have been noticed in items Nos,2,3 and 4, These have been corrected, | (b) As regards the Persian translations, it would i appear that translations of items Nos,2,3,4,5 and!3 have not been taken from any Persian originals, but prepared for the purposes of the compilation in your office. As the Persian version is of importance j from the Shaikh's point of view and in order to avoid any misapprehen/slon in his mind it .might be advisableadvisable to secure his previous assent to the wording ot the translations before embodying them in the compilation. Unless, therefore, you see any objection, tiie matter might be cleared up by a vaf a- reference to the Shaikh. (c) As to the appendix, presumably it is not intended to include the whole correspondence enclosed in Sir P.Gox's despatch, Nol795, dated the 25th July 1909, but only the agreement between the Shaikh and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company enclosed therein. If so, a copy of the original Persian translation should be added. It is for consideration whether the following documents might not with advantage figure in the compilation, viz., (1) The Shaikh's guarantee of the Nizames-Sultaneh good faith in the matter of the latter's under taking to give land in Arabistan for railway purposes ( vide Sir P.Cox's despatch, Ho.2223, dated the 15th September 1912), and (2) The ten-years' option granted by the Shaikh to the British Government for the inflation of a specific piece of land on the banks of the Karun (vide Bushire Residency letter, No.470, dated the 14th February 1914 ). Copies of these documents are attached, for facility of reference. If you see no objection to their inclusion in the compila tion, I am to ask that copies of the original Persian txxxxxx translations be added, 4, Similarly the concession granted by the Persian Government to Mr.D'Arcy in 1901 for the exploitation of minerals in Southern Persia might perhaps- also be suitatayj included, A reference to this instrument was expressly Inserted in the Shaikh's agreement with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, and the latter, in point of duration!duration, renewal and extension, runs parallel with the D'Arcy Concession, A copy of an English transla tion of the document is attached, and, if you agree to its inclusion, I am to suggest that a copy of the original Persian translation might he obtained from the Legation or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, 5, I am to return the compilation herewith, and to request that it may be completed in the light of the foregoing remarks, and returned to this office for issue in the form of previous compilations.

Shaikh of Mohammerah to be informed that as he is a subject of the Persian Government the British Government cannot of course promise to support him against his own government, nor in the event of a break up of the Persian Government can we guarantee his independence or in fact say what would happen as the British Government have not decided what its course of action would be in such a contingency. We consider him, however, the most influential individual in this part of Persia and desire to see him strong and the Arabs united under his authority as it will conduce to the interests of the country. The Shaikh may rely on the support of the Minister at Tehran whenever that support can be given without ill-faith to the Persian Government and he will always advise the Shaikh on any subject on which he requires it. In return the Minister trusts that the Shaikh will further the interests of British trade in every way he can. The Minister is opposed to any change in the existing Customs arrange ments at Mohammerah.2 COPY OP A LETTER EROM SIR ARTHUR HARDINGE TO SHAIKH OE M.OHAMMERAH, DATED TEHRAN, 7th DECEMBER 1902. I trust that Your Excellency is in the enjoyment of all health and well being. I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Teheran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring; but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may he possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. I was very glad to hear from Haji Rais ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general groueds of policy it is very desirable that differences should, as far as possible, be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character and the preservation of the integrity and independence of the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that under present circumstances the Arabs and yourself as their ruler have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Teheran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. Eor this reason, I think you acted wisely in giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a Customs house and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to do, to a friendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration. Haji Rais ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as you behaved to us, as you have done in the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs and to dissuade the Government of Teheran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere with them. Haji Rais ut-Tujjar thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself nor of attacks by neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders, but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a power might be at war with Persia and might as an enemy of the Shah send ships to attack your district, or such power pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act in its behalf might attempt also by means of its ships to conquer vou and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise w r e should, I believe, interfere provided you had acted in accordance with our advice, and our fleet which is the strongest of any in the Persian Gulf would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I added, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government and he has now authorized me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign powder, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice w r e will continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regal’d the danger, at any rate at present, as a real one.The Pcreian Government desires, I am sure as earnestly as von do flip “n“whJch^tle'Tet' inf ° rmed “ 8 ’ s P iri ‘ of’colons unaer wincli the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them We serve of course our right to object to any further change which we may X interests 6 ^ “ Pea ° e and trade 0n the Karun &gt; to be detrimental to ... 1 trust that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will verv likely be some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdoi and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Y Our Consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. Your sincere friend, ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.w.m r ' 4 r ' ' f r &gt;i No. 3.

COPY OF LETTER FROM POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF, DATED 1st DECEMBER 1908, TO HIS EXCELLENCY SHAIKH KHAZAL, SARD A R-I-AREA, SHAIKH OF MOHAMMERAH. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform you that I Ouly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview which I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with Your Excellency on 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of government ex- penditure subsequently received from you through Mr. McDouall. The reply of His Majesty s Government reached me through His Majesty’s Legation in September last, but m view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity o± the post, I thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to Head quarters. On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan and have since waited for your return to Failiyah. I am directed to repeat on behalf of His Majesty’s Government the assur ances given to Your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister Sir Aiihur Hardinge, dated December 7th, 1902, which is in your possession and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview above referred to ; and I am then to add that His Majesty’s Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that under taking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which Your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon Your Excel lency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity, which is recognized by the terms of the Anglo-Russian convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am Your Excellency’s sincere friend and well-wisher, P. Z.

After compliments and enquiries after your welfare. I have the honour to acquaint Your Excellency that I recently heard from Mr. Consul McDouall of the action which you have seen fit to take at this juncture in connection with the Revenue from the Customs of the port of Mohammerah. That is to say I learn that Your Excellency has ordered that until further notice the proceeds from the Customs receipts of Mohammerah are not to he sent forward to Teheran, but are to be retained at Mohammerah. Hearing this news I think it advisable to remind Your Excellency in the clearest manner possible that the Customs Revenues of the Gulf Ports includ- in°- Mohammerah are pledged to the British Government as security for loans granted by the British Government to the Persian Government. This matter Ts well-known and beyond dispute, and I trust that I shall receive from Your Excellency at early date an assurance that in the matter of the Customs receipts the claims and interests of His Majesty’s Government, between whom and yourself such friendly relations have always existed in the past, will be strictly safeguarded by Your Excellency.

After the usual compliments .—On the 1st December 1908 I had the honour by the direction of His Majesty’s Government, to repeat to Your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of Government by His Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, in his letter of 7th December 1902 to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia and that that under taking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance of the same state of autonomy which Your Excel lency at present enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon Your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you represen ted that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a Sovereign State, and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a Sovereign State and the intervention or occupadon by Foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provid ed immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered pre vention of similar action on the part of a parliamentary government. In reply to these representations, Your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not properly speaking able to admit even the possibi lity of Persia ceasing to be a Sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a Foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to Your Excellency would become even more binding fhan before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were pre pared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902 and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements ; but you have further requested that the words “ heirs and successors ” may be changed and the words “ own successive male descendants ” may be written instead ; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Govern ment will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regard ing their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words “ male de scendants ” as above, the words “up to a period of 100 years” (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give Your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no time in communicating to them your re presentations. I am Your Excellency’s sincere friend, P. Z. COX, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.* 8 No. 7.

Since then the state of Persia has again been disturbed. The authorities of the British Government, like Your Excellency, are hopeful that the Constitutional ^regime will eventually be firmly established, but in the meanwhile it is necessary for me to remind you that the Customs of your district are included in the Customs which on account of the loans advanced to the Persian Government, are pledged to the British Government, and if your Customs revenues should be expended in a way that may be prejudical to our claims on them, Your Excellency will incur responsibility to the above Government.

Youe Excellency, It is over a year now since I have had the pleasure of visiting you ashore owing firstly to absence in Europe and secondly to quarantine difficulties since my return. This has been a cause of regret to me, but I am very glad now to be able to visit Your Excellency here in your palace at Failiyah, and the pleasure of coming has bjen greatly enhanced by the auspicious nature of my present errand. I am commanded by His Majesty’s Government to announce to Your Excellency that my August Sovereign, King George the Fifth, may his Kingdom endure, has been pleased to confer on you the high honour of a Knight Commandership of the Indian Empire, and I am on their behalf to present you with the Insignia thereof. This indication of good-will and esteem on the part of His Majesty’s Government is conferred on Your Excellency as a mark of their appreciation of your sustained efforts to preserve order and security for trade in the districts under your control and thereby to assist the progress of civilisation and com merce. Unfortunately, as we all know, many districts in Persia have now for a long time been disturbed and trade routes interrupted. It is, therefore, all the more a matter of congratulation to you that this region has not fallen into a similar plight. With this short preface, I will proceed to present Your Excellency with the said decoration, and in doing so I need only add the hope that you may long be preserved to render loyal and patriotic services to your own Government and to continue, as in the past, to promote the cordial relations which have long existed between the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and the British Governmen from the time of Shaikh Haji Jabir Khan until now.10 h No- 9- THE TEEMS IN WHICH HIS EXCELLENCY SHAIKH KHAZAL KHAN, 'SHAIKH OE MOHAMMEEAH, EETUKNED THANKS TOE HIS PEESENTATION WITH THE OEDEE OF K.C.I.E.

Whereas a friendly discussion has taken place between me (Shaikh Khazal) and Maior Cox and Mr. McDouall regarding the desire of the Anglo-Persian Company to lease certain lands in the territorial limits of myself and my tribe, for the establishment of an oil refinery and structures connected therewith and for the laying of a pipe line from the head of the oil wells, and for the works m connection therewith, and whereas it appears that their precise requirements are as follows :— (1) A strip of land for bringing the said pipe line from the head of the above oil pipes to the refinery is needed. (2) A plot of uncultivated land on the island of Abadan with a frontage of 2,000 yards on the Shatt-al-Arab between the villages of Braim and Bawairda is required, the area of which shall not exceed 650 jareebs. (3) Rieht of way between this plot of land and the Bahmanshir (i.e., Turra) river. (4) Right to acquire further uncultivated land contiguous to the said plot, in case of necessity, at the same fair rate as that (ground) abovementioned from the present date up to a period of one year. If they want it after that lapse of time it will be leased at the fair current rate of the time. (5) If the above plot of ground he eventually not approved for the abovemeutioned works the Oil Company have the right to acquire instead another site of the same size on another part of the island of Abadan upon the same terms. (6) If the Oil Company require any other land on the banks of the Karun, etc., for wharfage and storage and for other purposes, of course to the best of my power I am ready to meet their require ments at the fair current rate of the time. Therefore, I, Shaikh Khazal Khan, on my own part and on behalf of my descendants and my tribes agree that I will lease to the Oil Company the above land which they may need for the pipe line and refinery establishment and connected works, with good title in as much as concerns my rights over it, for such time as the Company, during the duration of their Concession, may require. This lease is subject to one of the following terms, of which the Company are at liberty to choose whichever they may prefer. That is to say (1) For an annual rental of £650 sterling to he paid in advance every ten years. (2) For an annual rental of £1,000 sterling to be paid to me annually in advance, it being stipulated that— (a) after the expiry of the period of their Concession which will be defined (i.e., in the subsequent agreement which would be drawn up between the Company and the Shaikh), all the buildings, workshops, etc., for themselves and for the oil refinery, etc., and all the buildings which they may construct in those limits, with the necessary gear for the refinery of oil which they may possess there, all become my property, and * With original papers.the Company will not have the right to remove them or to demand their value. (2) The Company’s officials have no right to interfere in the affairs of my tribes. For instance, if they require to engage (tribesmen as) servants, etc., it must be with my cognizance. (3) If at any time in the process of excavating land for the buildings and workshops and laying the pipe line any treasure should come to light in those lands it is my property and they have no right to take possession of it or make any demands on that account. (4) In case, after the expiry of their Concession, they should obtain a renewal of the Concession from the Government, then they must lease these buildings, workshops and this property, with the land, in a way satisfactory to me or to my descendants.

TRANSLATION OR SHAIKH OR MOHAMMERAH’S CUSTOMS RARMAN, DATED JUNE 1902=RABI II 1320. By the Grace op God, Seal of His Imperial Majesty Mozaffar Din Shah. Whereas Our royal, august and sacred mind is strongly inclined towards the entire reformation of the Customs Department of the exalted (Persian) Government, and whereas its regulation and arrangement are calculated to the ease of the general public, we have therefore appointed and selected efficient and competent persons as Directors (of Customs) in the provinces, countries, territories and ports. The degree of the efficiency and competence of His Excellency Shaikh Khazal Khan, Moezz-es-Sultanah, Amir Toman, being also obivious and evident to us, we have, therefore, honoured him with the post of Director-General of Customs in the ports of Mohammerah and Arabistan, and he must have full superintendence and supervision over all the affairs and give effect to the instructions of the Customs Ministry. But as there is no capable and worthy official in the port of Mohammerah who may be lit to render this service and recover the Customs duty in accordance with the new tariff, as is at present levied in the other territories, therefore, Monsieur Waffelaerfc, who is Belgian official employed by the exalted Government, with Mirza Yantz, as Persian subject, will be sent for the purpose of assisting him, sio that Monsieur Waffelaert should act as a subordinate under the Director-General and the Moezz-es-Sultanah should also be under the control of the Customs Ministry. It is obvious that Monsieur Waffelaert must behave towards His Excellency with extreme reverence and respect and should accept, and comply with his advices and instructions at necessary junctures, in all the Customs affairs relating to the Arabs and natives. In the same way, the Moezz-es-Sultanah undertakes to treat the officials with the utmost friendliness and to afford them the fullest support and co-operation. And he also undertakes to give his acquiescence for his own small steam pinaces to be at their disposal whenever the Customs Department wishes to investigate and search vessels laden with merchandise, so that the 5 per cent, duty can be recovered from all merchandise imported and exported. It is confirmed that under the circumstances absolutely not a single cent shall be recovered in the interior of the country, under any name or guise whatever, from such merchandise as has already paid its duty. The selection and appointment of the necessary employes and staff for the local Customs Department shall he made with the approval of the Moezz-es-Sultanah. In consideration of this worthy service on his part, we have granted and fixed for him by way of salary a sum of 1,000 tomans per mensem, making a total of 12,000 tomans per annum, out of the Customs incomes, as suggested by His Most Noble Excellency the Atabeg-i-Azam, so that every year he may receive it and busy himself in rendering services, with the utmost confidence. It is commanded that the respected Royal Secretaries should register this auspicious Earman and consider it their duty to do. Dated this month of Rabi-el-Sani, Pars il, 1320. (June 1902.)

In connection with the railway from Mohammerah to Dizful to which yon made a reference in the course of our conversation of yesterday, I have the honour to state that after the British Company obtained a concession tor the said railway from the Persian Government, I will have no objection and use no pressure in regard to any terms that the British Government authorities may arrange with the Company for the right of passage m such portion ot the territories of my Arabistan properties through which it may pass. ^ The promise given by His Excellency the Sardar-i-Arfa in this connection, on my behalf, is also correct.

As to the matter of the railway about which I verbally represented to you some time ago that whenever a Company of British subjects obtains a concession for the Luristan road from the authorities of the Persian Government, such portion of the Nizam-es-Sultanah’s territory in Arabistan through which it may pass should be used free (of charge) or that any right of passage which may be arranged by the British Government authorities will hold good. As you stated in reply that it concerns the Company and that you did not want it gratis for this reason, the Nizam-es-Sultanah has not, in view of this consideration, imde any hint (about the free use of the territories) in the note which he has addressed to you, but I beg to tell you definitely that as soon as an arrangement is decided upon by the British Government authorities—at the time of the extension of the railway—in regard to the passage of the railway through the Nizam-es-Sultanah’s properties whether it be for the free use thereof or for any right of passage that they may fix—I am pledged that the Nizam-es- Sultanah will accept (the same). I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of my high esteem. May the days of fortune endure. KHAZAL.APPENDIX III (b). No. 28. OPTION TO THE NOMINEE OE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT GRANTED BY SHAIKH SIRKHAZAL KHAN OE MOHAMMERAH EOR IRRIGATION ON A PIECE OE LAND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER KAREN. The reason of the writing of this document is this that I have agreed that to whatever person the Powerful English Government may nominate, I will oive a concession for the irrigation of a piece of land on the hanks of the river Karun towards the north between Q,usheh-i-Maniat and Rahwali in whatever spot they may select. The amount of the extent of this land will be determined and delimited at the time that it is desired to commence the work and likewise the rights and conditions of “ this one ”* * The shaikh. with reference to this concession will be put forward at the same time with the agreement of the two sides. It is evident that until the agreement on this account is signed, sealed and exchanged between the two parties that one (the Concessionaire) has no right to commence this work or to start irrigation. If after this at any time it should he known that the railway will pass over or cross this piece of land which has been fixed upon whatever rights may be attached to the passage of the railway will be given to this one who is the owmer of the land and the said holder of the concession will have absolutely no connection or relation with them. The said holder of the concession wdll have no other rights in the appointed piece of land except those of irrigation for agriculture that he should interfere wuth or take possession of the land, etc. The duration of the bond of this document is from this date up to a period of ten years, after the termination of that period of ten years this paper will be null and void and of no effect.

Beloved and esteemed Emend ! I address Your Highness on the subject of the unhappy differences which have arisen between yourself and Your Highness’s brother, the ruler of Zanzibar; and for the settlement of which Your Highness has engaged to accept the arbi tration of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Having regard to the friendly relations which have always existed between the Government of Her Majesty the Queen and the Government of Oman and Zanzibar and desiring to prevent war between kinsmen, I accepted the charge of arbitration between you and in order to obtain the fullest knowledge of all the points in dispute I directed the Government of Bombay to send an officer to Muscat and Zanzibar to make the necessary enquiries. Brigadier Co^hlan was selected for this purpose, an officer in whose judgment, intelligence and impartiality the Government of India reposes the utmost confidence. Brigadier Coghlan has submitted a full and clear report of all the questions at issue between Your Highness and your brother. I have given my most careful attention to each of these questions* The terms of my decision are as follows:— 1st. That His Ilighness Syud Majid be declared ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of His late Highness Syud Saeed. That the ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 crowns. 3rd. That His Highness Syud Majid pay to His Highness Syud Thowaynee the arrears of subsidy for two years, or 80,000 crowns. I am satisfied that these terms are just and honourable to both of you t and as you have deliberately and solemnly accepted my arbitration, I shall expect that you will cheerfully and faithfully abide by them and that they will be carried out without unnecessary delay. The annual payment of 40,000 crowns is not to be understood as a recog nition of the dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, neither is it to be considered as merely personal between Your Highness and your brother Syud Majid. It is to extend to your respective successors and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement, compensating the ruler of Muscat for the abandon ment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequality between the two inheritances derived from your father, His late Highness Syud Saeed, the venerated friend of the British Government, which two inheritances are to be henceforward distinct and separate. Eokt William; The 2nd April 1861. I am, Your Highness’s Sincere friend and well-wisher, (Sd.) CANNING.TO HIS EXALTED EXCELLENCY LORD CANNING, GOVERNOR- GENERAL OE INDIA, ETC., ETC., ETC. In the name of the Great God ! After compliments .—At a most propitious and favourable time we were honoured with the receipt of your esteemed letter and were highly gratified with its contents. TVhat Your Excellency has stated is most satisfactory to as, more especially as regards your award betwixt us and our brother Majid. We heartily accept the same, and are at a loss how to express our regret for haying occasioned you so much trouble, and our appreciation of the kindness which has been manifested towards us in this matter. ^ We thank God for your efforts on our behalf, praying also that your good will may be rewarded and that you may never cease to be our support. V e further pray that our sincere affection may always be towards the Great (British) Government, and that it may increase continually: moreover, that your exalted affection and noble solicitude may always be exercised towards us, and that w r e may never ^ be deprived thereof. As regards our brother Majid, we pray God during our life time he may never experience anything from us but kindness and hearty good will. Eurthermore, we rely implicitly on your arbitration between us (being carried out).

Chiefs of the Arab Coast who aee in Treaty relations with the British Government, —I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India of the British authority which you and your fathers and forefathers have known and dealt with for more than a hundred years ; and my object is to show you that, though you live at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, hut that they adhere to the policy of guardianship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of a century; and that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundred years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf ; almost every man was a marauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave-trading flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put out to sea without fear of attack; the pearl-fishery was a scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace[ 2 ] there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened, and said that, in the interest of its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe while it lasted, but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs and a “perfect maritime truce ”—to use the words that were employed—“ for evermore ”; that, in the event of aggressions on any one by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure, at all times, the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed but on the whole it has well deserved its name; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest among you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven years since the last disturbance of the peace occurred.Chiefs, out of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves, whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Government, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs, there is no fear that any one else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there are persons who ask why should Great Britain continue to exercise these powers ? The history of your States and of your families and the present condition of the Gulf are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modern times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. W e saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours.We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Govern ment must remain supreme. There is one respect in which the Chiefs themselves can avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing thereiu. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo ; for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his Treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that a certain portion of that strip of the Oman coast known as the Batineh, on the opposite side of the Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis, Nevertheless, his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the oflicers of his Government, and it is as his representa tive in India who is responsible to him for your welfare that I am here to-day to exchange greetings with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future.Treaties and engagements in force on 1st January 1906 between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab Coast. [IvOTE. In the event of doubt hereafter arising as to the precise interpretation of any portion of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive.] General Treaty with the Arab Tribes of the Persian Gulf—1820. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise he to God, who hath ordained peace to be a blessing to his creatures. There is established a lasting peace between the British Government and the Arab tribes, who are parties, to this contract, on the following conditions :— Article 1 . There shall he a cessation of plunder and piracy by land and sea on the part of the Arabs, who are parties to this contract, for ever. Article 2 . If any individual of the people of the Arabs contracting shall attack any that pass by land or sea of any nation, whatsoever, in the way of plunder and piracy and not of acknowledged war, he shall he accounted an enemy of all mankind, and shall he held to have forfeited both life and goods. An acknowledged war is that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government; and the killing of men and taking of goods without procla mation, avowal, and the order of a Government is plunder and piracy. Article 3. The friendly (literally the pacifieated) Arabs shall carry by land and sea a red flag, with or without letters in it, at their option, and this shall be in a border of white, the breadth of the white in the border being equal to the breadth of the red, as represented in the margin (the whole forming the flag known in the British Navy by the title of white pierced red); this shall he the flag of the friendly Arabs, and they shall use it, and no other. Article 4. The pacifieated tribes shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall he at peace with the British Government, and shall not fight with each other, and the flag shall he a symbol of this only, and of nothing further. *[ 6 ] Aeticle 5. The vessels of the friendly Arabs shall all of them have in their possession a paper (Eegister) signed with the signa ture of their Chief, in which shall he the name of the vessel, ^ its length, its breadth, and how many Karahs it holds. And they shall also have in their possession another writing (Port Clearance) signed with the signature of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the owner, the name of the Nacodah, the number of men, the number of arms, from whence sailed, at what time, and to what port bound. And if a British or other vessel meet them, they shall produce the Register and the Clearance. Aeticle 6 . The friendly Arabs, if they choose, shall send an Envoy to the British Residency in the Persian Gulf with the necessary accompaniments, and he shall remain there for the transaction of their business with the Residency; and the British Government, if it chooses, shall send an Envoy also to them in like manner; and the Envoy shall add his signature to the signature of the Chief in the paper (Register) of their vessels, which contains the length of the vessel, its breadth, and tonnage; the signature of the Envoy to be renewed every year. Also all such Envoys shall be at the expense of their own party. Aeticle 7. If any tribe, or others, shall not desist from plunder and piracy, the friendly Arabs shall act against them according to their ability and circumstances, and an arrangement for this purpose shall take place between the friendly Arabs and the British at the time when such plunder and piracy shall occur. Aeticle 8 . The putting men to death after they have given up their arms is an act of piracy, and not of acknowledged war; and if any tribe shall put to death any persons, either Muhammadans or others, after they have given up their arms, such tribe shall be held to have broken the peace; and the friendly Arabs shall act against them in conjunction with the British, and, God willing, the wai against them shall not cease until the surrender of those who performed the act and of those who ordered it.Article 9. The carrying off of slaves, men, women, or children, from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature. Article 10 . The vessels of the friendly Arabs, hearing their flag above described, shall enter into all the British ports and into the ports of the allies of the British so far as they shall be able to effect it; and they shall buy and sell therein, and if any shall attack them, the British Government shall take notice of it. Article 11 . These conditions aforesaid shall be common to all tribes and persons, who shall hereafter adhere thereto in the same manner as to those who adhere to them at the time present.

Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Ti—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 341-E.B, dated 24th January 1906, regarding a compila tion of treaties between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs. The custom inaugurated in 1904, of handing to each Chief, on his acces sion, a copy of the principal Treaties by dateShf 12 th octoberioo? letter X °' 3460 ' E ' B ’ which his predecessors were bound, coupled with an invitation to him to notify un reservedly his acceptance of them and other obligations attaching to him in practice, apart from formal conventions, has been found to he convenient and useful, and has led to a suggestion that a similar, but' confidential, publication, covering the English and Arabic versions of all treaties and undertakings of importance between the British Government and the other Eulers on the Arab Coast with whom we are in Treaty relations, would prove of similar use and value. 2. I have therefore under compilation, with the assistance of the Political Agents concerned, a collection of such documents, both in the original Arabic and in English, and have the honour to submit the collection regarding Kuwait herewith. I hope to be in a position to submit the Maskat and Bahrain collections shortly, together with copies of certain further documents relating to the Trucial Coast, which it is convenient to have on record in the original Arabic, though it does not seem necessary or desirable at present to furnish the Chiefs with copies. 3. The agreement entered into by the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1841 to maintain the Maritime Truce for a period of one year, which forms the first item in the present collection, has not been brought to the notice of Govern ment before, as far as I am aware, and no translation of it is to be found in Aitchison. I myself was not aware of its existence until a few days ago, when it came to light whilst the originals of other old treaties were being looked for. j 4. I venture to suggest, for the consideration of Government, that the collection now enclosed be suitably printed, in English and Arabic, each document or set of documents on separate pages, English and Arabic separate; and would ask that this Eesidency may be favoured with 30 copies of the collection, for purposes of record. It would be convenient if 5 copies could be supplied suitably bound, the remainder in loose sets. This arrangement will make it possible to furnish a Chief on his accession, or at other times, without inconvenience or delay, on receipt of orders from . , Government,, with copies of the Treaties Vide correspondence ending with Foreign Depart- i/i- i ment letter No. 3134-e.b, dated the i5th August and other undertakings by wTnch he IS 1905 - bound and which it may be considered expedient to communicate to him as was done at Bahrain at the request of the Shaikh himself in 1905. Apart from this, it is convenient to have on record, in an accessible and authoritative form, the text of these treaties, some of the originals of which are of old date and too fragile to be handled oftener than is absolutely necessary. ilseaived on 22 JUL ’i(jwElj INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

Should, God forbid, any one commit an act of aggression on my subjects and dependents at sea, I will not proceed immediately to retaliate but will inform the aforesaid Resident, so that he may proceed to carry out the necessary punishment and retaliation after enquiring into the matter.
