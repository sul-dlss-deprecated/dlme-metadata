Telegraphic Address: BILV3HLm; ,, BOMBAY. No. G/3712. The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, DELHI. Sir, We have the honour to place the following facts before the Government of India with a fervent hope that the same will receive the Government's kind consideration. This Company is registered in Bombay under the Indian Jompanies Act 1913. One of the steamers of this Company, the s.s. r AHi2j2jDI H sailed from Bombay on the 18th October 1932 for Bahrein and Cjair in the x-ersian Gulf via Karadki with general merchandise. The vessel after loading cargo at Karachi for the said ports sailed from there direct for Bahrein on the 23rd October 1932 and arrived at Bahrein at 10-10 A.M. on the 27th October 1932. Before the vessel's departure from Bombay we had v/ritten to our Bahrein Agent Mr. Yusoof Bin Ahmed Kanoo, who has worked as this Company's Agent since many years, about the fixture of the vessel for the port of Bahrein and Ojair, and after the vessel's departure from Karachi we wired to . our said Agent at Bahrein about the same and also informed him of the expected arrival time of the vessel at Bahrein. Immediately on receipt of our telegram our Bahrein Agent replied by wire expressing his regrets for his inability to act as our Agent without assigning any reason. This telegraiii was despatched and received by us on the 24th October 1932. On the same day we sent a telegram to Messrs Mustaffa Bin Abdul Latif a well known firm of Bombay and Bahrein appointing- them as our Agents at Bahrein. Later on 24 Langalore Street, Fort, Bombay, 7th December 1932.on the 25th October 1932 we received telegram from Usssre Mu staff®, reading ; '3CRRY ADVISE YOU WIRE AGENCY ALAJAJI M . On tne 26tii October 1932 we wired to Yessre# iiohomed Abdul Aziz /J-ajaJi &amp; Bros, at Bahrein to act as our Agents and further informed them that the vessel v.as expected to arrive at Bahrein on the 27th October 1932. As up to the 26 th October v/e did not receive any news from Messrs. Mohamed Abdul Aziz Alajaji &amp; Bros, regarding the vessels arrival at Ban rein and the progress of discharge of Bahrein cargo, we sent a telegram to them on the 28t]i October 1932 requesting them to wire us tue vessel's arrival and waen sae should be sailing for Ojair. On the 28th October 1932 we received a telegram from Messrs koha:iied Abdul Aziz Alajaji and Jros., informing us that they had accepted our Agency but that the Bahrein Government had refused them permission to become our Agents. For the first time v;e came to know that the reasons for refusal of our Agency by l!r. Yusoof Bin Ahmed Kanoo and Llessrs Mostaffa Bin Abdul Latif was the refusal of the Bahrein Government to grant them pemission to act as our Agents. On the 28th October 1932 v/e received a telegram from the Master of the s.s. '-AHMKDI 11 , dated the 27th October 1932, informing us that he arrived at Bahrein on Thursday the 27th October 1932 and that the Bahrein Government would not allow the discharge of the Baarein cargo unless 2/o duty was paid on Ojair cargo. Immediately on receipt of the above telegram from trie iiaster we sent a wire to HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1 S CONSUL at Bahrein acquainting him with the above facts and requesting him to intervene and do the needful, but regret to state that so far v/e have not even received a bare acknowledgement from him. The vessel was detained at Bahrein upto the 31st October 1932 and had to sail away to a place called M RASTANOORA H to discharge the Bahrein and Ojair cargo. During the period of the vessel's detention at Bahrein she was completely isolated and no one was allowed to go on board and even fresh provisions were not allowedto be taken on board. As a result of this ban on our vessel at Bahrein, we have suffered considerably besides we have had to pay Rs. 100o/- as compensation to the Charterers for the vessels late arrival at Basrah where she was to arrive before tae 5th iToveiaber 1932 to load dates. Thus we have suffered a loss of a tout us-fecOO/- i.e. Rs. 5000/- for detention at 3a:irein and tiastanoora to which latter port the vessel was compelled to proceed to discharge her cargo where discharging facilities were nil, and Rs. 1000/- paid to the Charterers as compensation for the late delivery of the vessel at Basrah to the Charterers. \\ T e most respectfully submit that the order of the Bahrein Government was quite illegal and unjustifiable, and therefore the Bahrein Government must compensate us for the lose we have suffered, not to speak of the indignities that were offered to a British ship. V« 7 e send herewith copies of, correspondence passed between the Baarein Authorities, our Agent and Llaster of the s.s. 'AHSEEDl M in support of our case. As will be seen from tae copies of correspondence between the Bahrein Autnorities and the blaster of the s.s. 'AKHEDI'• the said ban was imposed by the Batirein Government only for our ship shortly before her arrival at Bahrein and we cannot for a moment understand the reasons for the said ban on our vessel. We now fervently hope that the Government of India will take effective steps into the matter and compel the Bahrein Government to compensate us for the loss we have suffered on account of the unlawful ban imposed on our steamer, and that in future no such oostacles are put in the way of a British Snip by a foreign Government. \.e have the honour to be.

My ship was then on tile i i _jh seas and.&gt; tne r*- iOre&gt; the alcove re nXations /e r^ 5 not in force nor in existence when I left Bombay and Karachi, otherwise my Owners would have taken steps to obtain the necessary permission from your Government before loading these cargoes. I therefore request you to exempt my ship from the provisions of the above regulations for this voyage and allow me to start discharging my cargo for Bahrein. As for the two pe rcent duty claimed on the Ojar cargo I suggest that you should claim this from the Owners of the cargo or the consignee as they are solely responsible to pay all custori duties on all import cargoes, not myself nor my Owners or their representatives further I beg to apply permission to act as Agent for my ship and that I oay be allowed to appoint a sub-Ajent to deal with my import cargo for Bahrein.

J arrived here on Thursday at 10 a.m. Port Doctor boarded my ship immediately and given us free pratique; afterwards the Director of Customs came on board and informed me that I am not allowed to discharge my Bahrein cargo unless is paid to Bahrein Government on Cjair cargo as an ad- valorem duty# 1 immediately went ashore and discuss the point with the Adviser to Government, I pointed out to him all clauses of Merchant Shipping Act and other marine regulations and customs in other foreign ports, but I could not persuade him to allow Alajaji to act as agent, so I told him on ohe spot, to take notice that I shall be my oi/vn agent at Bahrein, as you did not accept trie man waom my owners employed therefore all other shipping agents are afraid to apply for fear of being refused again. However I am sending you copies of all correspondence passed between myself and the Bahrein authorities, you will see that 1 have done all I could to discharge cargo for Bahrein but without success, if the Political agent was here, I would have won my fight long ago, but he is at Bushire, I have wired to him but no answer. I expect that I shall be allowed to start discharging Bahrein cargo today as the adviser has given me a letter allowing the Bahrein landing cargo to land my cargo provided certain formalities have been complied with, regarding Cjair cargo, but the consignee has sent for the Director of Customs at Cjair who is arriving here at 8 a.m. today to discuss the matter, he says that if this man tell him to pay deposit as suggested, he will immediately deposit the amount in the Bank (Hs.212l), I shall wire you the result today, dont worry I am doing the needful, the only drawback is that the Political Agent is absent and the Indian Assistant who is here cannot do much to help me. I think that the Ahmedi willbe too deep to re^ach at Cjair, the pilot suggested to bring her in another place v/here there are plenty of water and land tue a - _ c in trie boats there i he said that the Pagervik arav.ing only 10 leet oi v.'ater and X shall be drawing 17^ a- 16r Icino^ng Bahrein cargo* Anyhow 1 will try my utmost to go as near as I could discharge CJair cargo. Copy of letter from Gapt. R» Parcou, Conunander of s.s. 'AHHEDI 11 dated Bahrein 30th October 1932 addressed to the Political Agent, Bahrein. The s.s. 'AKKcSDl H under my command arrived here on Thursday the 27th October 1932 at 10 A.M. and the Director of Customs boarded my ship and informed me about the undermention ed order from the Government of Bahrein ana handed over to me a copy of Miscellaneous Regulations for the port of Bahrein regarding the passengers and cargo and the last paragraph is dated the 24th October and runs as follows i- 'Co^y of Government Proclamation ETo. 28/1351 24 Jamal A1 Thany 1351. The public are reminded that no one is permitted to become an agent for a Shipping or Air Company in Bahrein or agent of any ship tuat loads or unloads cargo or passengers in Bahrein without obtaining permission from the Government. No one is allowed to load or unload passengers or cargo in Bahrein waters unless he obtains permission from the Government to do so. - ~^ applications should be in writing and submitted to the Director of Custom and Port Officer.' As this para relates only about permission to become an Agent and the loading and unloading of cargo and passengers it seems that this proclamation was framed for my shipship only, because, the agent whom my Company employed could not secure the necessary permission from the Govern ment to act as agent for my ship and also 1 am not allowed to discharge my cargo for this port. Under these circumstances I beg to point out to you that I failed to understand why my ship would not be allowed to discharge her cargo for this port after I have reported my arrival and deposited my manifests both for Bahrein and OJar cargo on the day of my arrival at the Custom House and therefore made the entry of my ship inwards according to law and regulations at Bahrein. You will understand that my ship is under British Colour and that there is nothing in these regulations which I can see to prevent me from landing my cargo except that I must ottain permission from the Government, but in every port when a ship has been entered inwards and manifests, passenger lists and crew list has been deposited with the Custom Authority it is a sure understanding that the vessel f-^^e to land her passengers and cargo for the port where she has actually made her entry inwards. In the case of my vessel I was allowed to land passengers but not the cargo. Another steamer of the City line came in after me and was allowed to discharge all her cargo and passengers and left tne same day. I consider that, this is not legal and that the orders passed on my ship by the Bahrein Government is detrimental to my Owners alone, a.s other vessels which enter ttjis port were not subjected to the same unlawful orders. I strongly protest against the actions of the Bahrein Government with regards to my snip at Baarein and reserve all my rights to render this Government responsible for the great delay and losses tnat my Owners may suffer througk delaying me to discharge my cargo for this port illegally. Further, I noticed that my ship is considered as an undesirable in Bahrein as no one from the shore is allowed on board except Custom Officers who keep watch on board since my arrival, my crew is deprived of fresh provisions and no boats0 boats are allowed to board the vessel under any circum stances. I have personally tried to get a boat to bring me on board on Priday afternoon but tney all refused for fear of being fined by the Director of Customs. Hoping you will take the necessary steps to redress the wrongs which my vessel and her crew have sustained during her stay at Bahrein and inform my Owners at Bombay the result of your enquiries, I remain, Sir, Yours truly, Sd/- H.

Will you kindly go into this Matter t (6) Should the Bahrein Government Authorities grant a concession on the lines of paragraph 3 we do not see the necessity for the imposition of any minimum quantity In connection with cargo for the mainland.

In continuation ot my telegram hoiJ/lO dated the 12th January 1933,1 have the honour to enclose a cojjy of the marginally noted corres pondence, which has passed 'between me and the Bahrain Government regarding the transit trade of Bahrain and the Conference, Vviiich you have proposed,with the Sa T udi Arab Government. 2. From this correspondence it will be seen that the Bahrain Government accept the following lines upon which to mould their policy in regard to the transit trade:- (i) that,in future,it would be impossible to do otherwise than to allow any vessel bringing cargo oartly for Bahrain and partly for ports on the mainland to land at Bahrain in the ordinary way that part of her cargo consigned to Bahrain: in lact that there can be no repetition of the T Ahmedi T incident,and (ii) tiiat it is incumbent on the Bahrain Government to make the conditions under which the transit trade is carried on in Bahrain so attractive that the traae will ol its own volition use Bahrain rather than ports on the mainland. 3. To achieve the end of maicing the Port of Bahrain sufficientlysui i iciently attractive to retain the transit trade, tiie Bahrain GrOYernment are prepared to make tiie following arrangements (a) to allow direct transhipment within the Port limits ci consignments of goods,subject to a minimum of 1,000 bags in each consignment, (bj to increase the period of free idianchijah from 20 to 2b days,reckoned from trie aate on w^icl txie cargo is taken over by the customs Department,and (c) to limit the charges on re-export cargo stored in the customs sheds up to 25 days 'ta the duxy of and porterage,and to forego ^aladiyah and ±-ier tees. these arrangements go far to meet the requests that have been made from time to time by merchants. I would add that the Bahrain Government are prepared to reduce,or even to do away with,the minimum of 1,000 bags; and I understand that a minimum was lixed in tiie first instance at the request of the local iigents ol the British India ^tearn Navigation Oompany Limited,who considered that'difficulties might arise if numerous small shipments were to be made. 4. i understand that liis liXcellency Shaildi iiamad bin Isa al iQia±itah expressed sone displeasure at the suggestion of the British India Steam Navigation Oompany Limited that tne 2/«? duty on transhipped cargo should be reduced,as he seemed to regard it as asking him to help the Company at the expense of Bahrain. I can understand his taking this point of view and .uope that it will prove possible to preserve the transit trade without so costly a concession,but,when and if the time comes ^or the proposed Oonterence with a representative of the Sa T udi Arab Grovernment,it should be less difficult,than it would be at the moment,to persuade him to recognise that there is another point of view - that is to say,that to reduce the 2 /y duty may be the only means of saving something out of what may otherwise become a total loss ot the transit trade. It is only a conjecture on my part but I fancy that in his mind is working the idea that but for our insistence on a rate of there would have been a higher rate from which somethingmiglit mors easily have been 0 iverL away nov;. 5. it will oe seen tiiat tne jbaiirain Governraent are averse IxOiii anno one in^ to the public the fuller concessions which tnej contempxate,pending tne proposed Oonterence; but I understand tnat thej have communicated then contidentially to the local cl tne British India Steam Navigation Gompany Limited, and hope that in all the circumstances this will sufficiently meet your wishes regarding a re^ly to tne Company. I v .ould ado. tnat the usual heavy Ramadhan shipments nc~vo j oeen made anu that those lor the Pearling Season are not due lor another two and an half months,so that there is not m^cn dipping activity going on at present. It seems,tnerefore, unlikely that some delay in announcing tne concessions would do harm,ana i hope that it may be found possible to arrange for the proposed Conference witn the Sa f udi Arab Government before the Pearling Season Shipments are made. There is,it io Lx i.e,an alternative course ol mailing icnown tne concessions, ana using them as a means ol impressing on the Sa T udi Arab GrOYernnent the goodwill of tne Banrain Government,but 1 find it hard to oelieve that it would,in fact,have any effect other than to encourage the Sa T udi Arab Government to demand greater concessions. 6. his iixcellency Shaikh narnad bin isa al Khalifah agrees to the conference with a representative of the Sa T udl Arab Oovern- nt, -/hion you nave suggested,and has no objection to Muhammad al Tawwil being the representative of the Sa'udi Arab Govern- ~ient. ne asks^however,that it should not take place during Hamadhan. I iuliy agree that a Conlerence between the liahram Govern ment and a representative oi the 3a T udi Arab Government affords the most like^ nieans ol achieving a satisfactory settlement. 1 hope tiiat it may be possible for the Bahrain and Sa T uai Arab Governments to come to a friendly agreement over this matter Oo. the transit trane. jdoth sides have much to gsin by a fnennlj7 5 ' fe 4. settlement ot the matter,but there are many conflicting interests,both considerable and petty,and. also ^nde,involved, and it may not be easy for commonsense to prevail. % I Lave the honour to be Sir, xour niost Obedient Servant, Lieut Colonel.

Following are my comments. ^* Transit trade between Bahrain G-overn- -mei't and ^ejd was proceeding smoothly under arrangement made 'by Ihn Saud f s own representative Bin Jiluwi ( vide my telegram No 631 of 7th Octoher). avoid incidents Bahrain Government had moreover come to a subsidiary agreement with a certain Marzuk ( my despatch No 77S-S of 14th Octoher). This agreement was 'broken hy the send- ~ing cr 'APIMEDI* and Bahrain Government then took action in question. It was of course drastic, hut in my opinion was within their soverign rights, and owing to my mediation was less drastic than that originally pro- -posed ( compare last sentence of paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 885-S and the compromise which they were finally prepared to accept - paragraphs). Bahrain Government do not think it politic in future to take similar drastic action in AHli/iiiDI^ cases, hut the,/ would prefer to convey this inXoimation themselves to the Saudi Government at a later stage. 5... in, J \ \ ■^rI- Bahrain G-overnment quite recognise that commercial interests of Hejd and Bahrain are inter- -dependent and are ready to discuss whole question with Saudi Gtovernnient after Kamazan. 6 * In conclusion, I venture to suggest that our line with Saudi Grovermnent might 'be that Bahrain is a sovereign State which now, for instance, enjoys iiscal autonomy, hut that we are of course quite ready to give our good offices to effect an amicable settle- -ment* Resident. tost copy forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for information* By Order, for Secretary to the lolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf.19/212 Telegram R.27® y yrom Government of India,Foreign and Political Department, Uew Delhi.

We do not agree that sending of steamship ,, Ahmedi' # V V amounted to breaking of agreemwnt with Bin Jiluwi and Marauk. That agreement referred only to transhipment of goods in Bahrain territorial waters whereas in 'Ahmedi 11 case no transhipment was contemplated. On the other hand it is obvious that if through shipment of goods (? to) mainland after landing some cargo at Bahrain became common, Bahrain would be faced with great financial loss and they-ttfould seem to be justified in t aking measures in exercise of Their iioveriign rights over Bahrain port to counteract this danger, especially as they charge no port dues for use of port. We can see no alternative to that which tiiey adopted, viz*, forbidding landing of goods at Bahrain except on their own conditions, and consider that it is on these grounds that their action could be defended to Saudi G-overnment and not on grounds of breach of Agreement. We also feel doubtful about practicability of adopting line suggested in paragraph 6 of Residents telegram which we consider open to following objections: (l) arrangements of 1920 regarding transhipment dues at Bahrain were made with Ibn Saud by our representative on behalf of Bahrain, and Dickson's ^ * ) a -14-o letter G/196 of July 14th, 1920, refers to these arrangements as made under his Government's orders.

The Bahrain Government realise tdat.in the circumstances •■Inch obtain today,it is impossible to retain the transit trade though Bahrain by aggressive action or by political devices,and that it can only be conserved by making the Port of Bahrain so attractive tnat the trade will flow to the Port of its own tolition. They appreciate,moreover,that it is necessary to endeavour to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement with tne -'uai Arab Government if the transit trade is not to be ruined 0 tiie uetriment of all concernea in it. - To this end,the Banrain Government are prepared to ' laAe tde following arrangements(3) -2- (a) to alio# airect transiiipment witiiin the Port limits o WW w-».

The Bahrain GcTernment are prepared to bring into force at once their proposal (a) in the previous paragraph, tuat is to say,to allow direct transhipment within Port limits of consignments ol gooas,either subject to a minimum of 1,000 bags or without the minimum,and I understand that they are co/iimunieating 1 with you on the subject. 5. The Bahrain Government are,not unnaturally,opposed to considering a reduction in the 2* duty on gooas in transit, unless all other measures for conserving the transit trade fail. b. it is nopeu tnat it may be possible to effect an arrangement oetween the Bahrain and the Sa'uai Arab Governments nth a view to placing tde transit traae on a mutually satis factory basis and the best means of doing so is now under active discussion. Tue Bahrain Govefnment do not, tnerefore, wish to make public the concessions mentioned in sub-paragraphs (b, and (oj of tne third paragraph of this letter, as tiiey may Prove of use in bargaining with the Sa'udi Arab Government,and i trust that,in the circumstances,you will agree that the viewol trie Behrain Governnient is sound. 7- I nt-eu haruiy acta that every effort will be maue to preserve the interests of your Company.which are in essentials identical with those of the Banrain Government,ana I trust that it may be found possible to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement with the Sa T udi Arab G -overnment. 1 have the honour to be Gentlemen, Zour most obeaient servant, Sd/- Gr .Loch., Lieut Colonel.

As you are no doubt aware,the s.s 'Ahmeai' loaaea lawful general merchanaize in Bombay and Karachi for Bahrain ana Ojair ana proceeaeG to Bahrain for discharging the cargo of the port ol Bahrain ana with the intent to prodeed thereafter to Ojair lor discharging the cargo of that port. Most unfortunately for us ana lor reasons which we are not aware,the Government of Bahrain issued tneir proclamation Wo:28/1351 datea the 24th ^ Jamaa al Thany 1351 (corresponaing to 24th October 1932) when the 'Ahmeai'' was on her way to Bahrain,promoiting persons in ^Bahrain from acting as Agents to steamers ana airships without the previous permission of tne Government of Bahrain,and in consequence thereof Mr.Yusif din Ahmaa Kanoo,who was our Agent lor many years,refused the Agency of tne 'Ahmeai' and Mr. Mustapha bin Abdul Latif whom we desired to act as our Agent woulo not ao so,ana Messrs Muhammad Abdul Aziz Aiala^U &amp; Bros who actually accepted our Agency were not permittee to work as our Agents. The date of the above mentioned Proclamation and iroe working allowed to a 'City' line steamer while 'Abmeci' ''as there clearly show that the Proclamation was only mtenaed to apply to our Ship. The S.S 'Ahmedi' arrived at Bahrain on the 27th. October 1932 and owxng to the above circumstances there was no Agent to attend ^ her,and the Master of tne Ship acting on his own behalf made the entry ol the Ship inwards by depositing the cargo manifests ^ the Bahrain Customs house,applied to the lirector ol Customs and Port Officer,Bahrain,by his letter^ dated 28th Jamad 1351 ior permission to act as his own Agent for the ship; and fromyour letter dated 29/10/1932 addressed to the Manager,Bahrain Landing company,it would seem that permission to act as the Ship ? s Agent was given to the Iifeister and the matter of the landing oi Bahrain cargo depended upon completion of ''certain lormalities connected with the Grovernment f s claim for Customs on Ojair cargo' as expressed in your letter of 29/10/19j^ already referred to. Now,it is beyond our comprehension as to how the Bahrain Government coula object to the landing of the iiahrain cargo at Bahrain because of their alleged claim for auty on Ojair cargo which was never intended to be discharged at Bahrain but at Ojair itself, i^ven il there was such a claim of the Bahrain Government lor auty on Ojair cargo, tiie Bahrain Government could only claim it from the consignees and coula not apply their claim to the ship anc thereby prohibit the discharge of the Bahrain cargo. As it has nowever turned up,and to our great regret,all efforts of the Master of the s.s 'Ahmedi' to discharge at Bahrain,cargo of Bahrain were frustrated by the attitude of the Bahrain Government anu the snip had to sail away to Eas Tanoura on the 31st October 1932 for the discharge of her cargo. The ship thus lost five days at -ahrain and had also to incur great detention at Has Tanoura | for want of discharging facilities and thereby arrived at -asrah i later than sue should have arrived according to our Charter to i shippers at Basrah. The aetention at Bahrain has cost us Rs.5000/- 1 ln aciaiti on to which we had to pay Rs.1000/- aamages to the Charterers aue to the ship's late arrival in Basrah; and these m lo^ees are absolutely due to the above said action ix of the | Bahrain Government which we consider to be absolutely illegal. '■e are also very much grieved to learn from the Master of ih \ Ship that our s * s 'Ahmedi' was treated as an undesirable ship | at Bahrain ana was completely isolated and even fresh provisions l| that were so very necessary for the Officers ana crew of the f ship were not allowed to be supplied to her. ■Mle we are anxious to know if there are any just causes for the Bahrain Government for applying and enforcing such ipronibitory measures against a British siii^,we cannot help tenaering this our claim for Rs.6000/- for the losses sustained by us as shown above and request the Bahrain Government to pay us the same.

Even if correspondence with Ibn Jiluwi can be construed as an agrement, it related only to payment of dues on goods for erside delivery. Surely it is an extreme application of doctrine of sovereignty to say that a State can levy dues on goods Which are consigned to a foreign country and which mere ly pass through its territory on beard a ship having cargo to. botn destinations. If His Majesty 's Government endorse this view and should wish me to defend it in replying to Potion of Saudi memorandum, which deals specifically with 'Ahmedi I ■ II?'Alunedi^ I should kubAm need to be armed witn convincing arguments.

Unless you tiiint this essential I should prefer to suggest tnat Saudi and Banraini representatives should confer with the assistance of the Political Agent.

I shall telegraph again if and when British register of vessel is officially 'closed on sale to foreigners'. II - Secretary of State for Inaia - K||0 /a Pi On the evening of the 16th April 1933 Mr. W. H. Dowling had called on me at Subzabad and mentioned one or two points in connection with the distribution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's products in the Persian Gulf, especially on the Arabian side. I told him that I would L see him about it on the afternoon of the 18th April. 2, Mr, Dowling is, I understand, managing the dis tribution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's products in the Persian Gulf area. 3. On the 18th April Mr. Dowling told me that he had been to Gwadur, Shargah and Doha. At Shargah they had had some difficulties but t ley have now arranged that the Company shall build a suitable store-house to take 10,000 tins: that they will pay nothing to the Shaikh for the first year for rent or guards. After the first year the warehouse will become the property of the Shaikh who will lease it to them for Rs.140/— per mensem plus Rs-60/- per mensem for guards. Mr. Dowling proposes to place these arrangements ( which w«M3 given by the Shaikh in writingj^according to Mr. Dbwling) before his Company on his return to Abadan and if they approve to send an engineer of the Com^iany to Shargah by Imperial Airways to supervise the construction of the warehouse. They hope to be able to take advantage of the personnel iiil collected by Imperial Airways for the construction of that the Heat House. I said that I thought^it would be a wise thing if they were to send with the engineer ( who I understand will be a European and who will not know Arabic) a good interpreter. I said that I thought that it/ Copy forwmtded to Political Agent, Batirain, under P.L. No. 390-3. dated 18-4-3S. Extract paras. 1-4 and 9-12 sent to Town . IIll # A 11 ■it would be preferable that he should not send a Persian possible he should be a Gulf Arab and not one frcm Syria or , Iraq t as Arabs from these places are not altogether persona grata in Arabia proper, 4. Mr• Bowling told me that they had made arrange ments with the Sre ikh of Q,atar for an oil store at Doha, and that the 'Khuzistan' was going to call there. 5. l A t * Bowling also told me that they were negotia ting with Bin Saud about direct shipments of oil by the 'Khuzi8tan H to Ras Tanurah. They were anxious to get a footing in the oil market of Nejd and tbe Saudi Govern ment were anxious to develop the port of Ras Tanurah, The Oil Company had agreed to ship direct provided that payment would be made either to their Agent or to the Bank in Bahrain before each shipment was made. Mr. Dowling thought that this request for payment might prevent business being done, but he felt that unless they had money down they might find themselves unable to recover their debts. 6. I asked Mr. Bowling if he was conversant with affairs on the Arab Coast, and he said that he was not, because he had been for the last six years in Northern Persia, I said that I thought I had better tell him about the position as regards transit trade in Bahrain not because I had any wish that he should alter his business arrangements, as I thought that trade must necessarily flow along its natural channel^ where profit as was to be found, but because it would be^well for him to know what the position was. I explained briefly with which Mr. Bowling cordially agreed^and that if that/. HP 11 .that m the past owing to difficulties of navigation and insecurity on the mainland Bahrain had become the distributing centre for qatar, Uejd and Hasa: CjT' ~~— that now that there was comparative security on the mainland and the Saudi Government wish to make ' ' ^,the situation was rather different than in the past, though Bahrain might well keep sane of the transit trade owing to the facilities,such as bank, wire- leas, properly-lit harbour, which it possessed. I added that the question was much complicated by individual and national jealousies and pride, so that the transit question and the future of Has Tanurah was not altogether purely a commercial matter. J. Mr. Dowling had never seen Ras Xanurah and 1 told him that I had been there and that it was an excellent harbour but that 1 said that there were difficulties about water and that although the anchorage was excellent it would need careful navigation to get there unless the place was properly buoyed. he said that Haji Williamson had said that there were quite a fair popula tion there now. He is of course in a position to knnw so that I daresay that some water arrangements may have been made, possibly bringing it in tanks or boats from ^atif or elsewhere, B. I mentioned a rumour which I had heard in Bahrain of the Soviet* having given Bin Saud 1200 cases of oil. I said that it was no more jckxjg a rumour but that more than one or two persons had told me of it and all had agreed on the figure 1200. I said that probably their own people would know more about this*'' • .u H a. /ft) -4- ^ mentioned to Mr* Dowling merely as a matter of interest that there seemed to be a certain f eeling against the Anglo-Persian u il Company distribution because of the comparatively high prices charged. I emphasized that I was not in a position to criticize or to support this complaint, but that it was-so far as I knew - a general one, and that he might like to look into the matter, IV* I emphasiaed when talking about Doha and ^hargah, that the Political Agent, Bahrain, exercised a certain supervision over that part of the coast owing to communi- cations being easier for him than the Political Resident and that it would be as well if he would keep both the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain, informed of any steps which the Comia ny might be taking about their distribution. I said that we naturally did not wish to interfere in any commercial trans actions but that it was often possible .if we were informed^for us to give them advice which would help tnem and possibly at times to prevent difficulties such as had arisen atand Shargah. ne cordially agreed and promised to let me have ( as Political Resident and also as Political Agent, Bahrain^ informa tion of any steps which they propose to take. 1 asked liim to stay with me on shore if he ever came to Bahrain in the 'Khuzistan'. l|\ I think that Mr. Dowling is a pretty sick man and understand that he suffers from gall-stone* I ^ ( (tU.h PyA-*. c/ - /£/19/212 l n / Telegram R. ^7 From Political Resident, Bushire.

Arrangement at Has ''anurah would have sirailar advantages. Company are anxious to get as firm hold as possible on Najd and Hasa markets and I fancy that they regard direct shipments to Has Tanurah as particularly pleasing to Ibn Sand at present juncture. They may also regard it as a possible inf%ence towards getting them permission to search for oil in Hasa. Corapany already have distributing centre in Bahrain with. Yusuf Kanoo as aftentr. feivate.

Mr.E.H.Marker Board of Trade. Mr.Crombie India Office. Mr.Laithwaite briefly summarised the history of this question, a detailed analysie of which was contained in Mr.Johnstone's note which had been circulated by the Foreign Office. Kejd and Bahrain were to eome extent mutually dependent, since Nejd needed the facilities of the port of Bahrain while Bahrain needed the revenues which it derived from the entrepot trade. It was relevant that vessels above a certain torn age could not apparently approach certain parts of the Hasa coast without first lightening them selves at Bahrain or elsewhere, and that steamers of any sise were unlikely to find it worth their while to carry tralfic for Kasa only. As the result of pressure by H.M.G.Bahrain had in Ichl ' 1920 aSreed t0 reduce the tra nsit duty on goods r C / consigned to Ibn Baud's dominions and landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland to 2 per cent.and to allow free transhipment of goods so consigned direct fran steamers into lighters in Bahrain waters. Serious difiiculties had now arisen in connection with the second of these two concesBionB as the result of efforts to-evade the payment of transit duty. In the first place/ iS&lt;7^ 2. place an attempt had been made to extend the right of free tranfehipment within Bahrain territorial waters to goods transhipped from sailing craft. An agreement j reached with Ibn Jiluwi, Ibn Saud's Governor of Hasa, appeared to have disposed of this, although a point to some extent left obscure in the agreement (though the ansTier appeared to be in the affirmative) was whether or not it covered steamers as well as sailing craft. Secondly, tnere appeared to be some danger of tranship ment outside Bahrain territorial waters. Thirdly, cases had arisen (principally that known as the 'iihmedi' case) of direct shipment of goods to the mainland vessels which, while touching at Bahrain, had neither landed nor transhipped their mainland cargo, and so claimed to evade the Bahrain transit dues. t . v '/ ' 'iihmedi' incident had led to formal protests jf/ c h from th e Saudi Government and to a request for consideration of the whole position. There seemed fairly general agreement now among the interested authorities that the question could best be dealt with in the first instance by an infomal conference at Bahrain between representatives of the Saudi and Bahrain Governments, with the assistance of the Political Agent, Bahrain, the results of such conference to receive ultimate confirmation through the diplomatic channel at Jedda. If this view was accepted the points for imr-ediate consideration were the strength of the Bahrain I case and the arguments which could be suggested for use 1 by the Bahrain representatives in any such conference. The matter was one of sane urgency, since the India Office had just received reports that the Saudi Government had purchased a small steamer of its at Glasgow, presumably for use in the Hasa trade. Prima facie there seemed much to be said for aiming/9o 4. Mr .Marker thought that it would not be possible for the Bahrain Government to impose any restrictions on direct transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters, or any sanctions on ships in respect of the direct carriage of goods to the mainland. Mr.Laithwaite quoted the statement of the Financial Adviser,Bahraini that no action could be taken if a ship went direct from India, for example, to Nejd, but that the State might impose penalties if such a vessel called at Bahrain on its way to or from the mainland, Mrarker said that in the case of a ship, such as the 'Ahmedi', proceeding to Kasa via Bahrain and carrying cargo for Bahrain as well as Hasa, the prohibition of the landing at Bahrain of the Bahrain cargo was, in his view, rather high-handed. He was, however, inclined to agree that in cases where ships would be unable to proceed direct to the mainland without lightening themselves at Bahrain or where for any other reason they used Bahrain facilities en route to the mainland, the Bahrain authorities might properly levy a small duty in order to cover expenses of upkeep of the port, etc. on that portion of the cargo which wa£ consigned to Hasa, on the ground that it was transitting Bahrain territorial waters and enjoying the benefit of the facilities provided by the Bahrain Government. He doubted if retaliatory action could be justified where a ship proceeded . 4- direct to tne ma-inland before calling at BaJiraln* Mr.Warner referred to the political objections to any overt discrimination against ships carrying goods for Nejd and suggested that the possibility of charging port dues on all shipping might be further explored*/5. INIU j l.K u I ||*&gt; , 'VWlL 4 | K /■ ^ K, Wj, explored^ Would it be possible to deal with the matter by requirirg that all goods carried in vessels passing through Bahrain might be made to pay a small duty? Considerable further discussion took place as to possible methods of countering the endeavours which were beir^; made to evade the Bahrain transit duties. To the imposition of a duty on all goods passing through Bahrain there was the objection of the possible effect on cargoes for other ports in the Gulf and especially for Basra carried by the mail steamers touching at Bahrain. To a proposal that the mainland duty might be charged on the whole cargo of a ship calling at Bahrain for the specific purpose of or in furtherance of its trade with the Hasa mainland, there was the objection that this constituted a definite discrimination against Bin Saud. A suggestion by Mr .Johnstone that it might be possible to discriminate in accordance with tonnage, v/as reserved for further consideration. It was finally agreed that the India Office should write to the Board of Trade settir^ out in detail the difficulties which had arisen and asking for a ruling by the Board as to the extent to which Bahrain, having regard to general international practice, v/as free to take retaliatory action against ships which indulged in direct shipment to the Hasa coast to the injury of the port of Bahrain and the nature and limits of such action. Kr.Laithwaite then referred to the suggestion put forward at an earlier stage by the Political Agent, +- Bahrain, that the State might 'repatriate' alien merchants residing in Bahrain who indulged in direct transhipment. Action on these lines had been taken (without equally substantial justification) against Hindu traders in Nejd by Ibn Saud, but the objectionB 'to it/6. it were patent. The general sense of the meetii^ was that action on these lines was undesirable both on broad grounds and because of the danger of retaliation. Mr .Warner pointed out that, the arguments of a general nature in favour of an early and amicable settlement apart, it was definitely in the interests of Bahrain to lose no time in reaching a settlement and if need be to make some slight further conceesion to Ibn Saud. The discovery of oil in Hasa might,if the field proved worth working, lead to the development of the port of Ras Tanura and it might well be that it would pay Bahrain better to take the risk of direct shipment if she could obtain a satisfactory convention en the lines of the Bin Jiluwi agreement, rather than by standing out to risk the loss of the bulk of her transit trade. iv-r.Earner further raised the question whether it was desirable in approachir^ the Saudi Government regarding the proposed conference at Bahrain, to intimate that Bahrain had definitely decided that it could no longer continue the concession of free transhipment granted by it in 1920 or whether it might be better that no threat should be made before the conference was held. The objections to giving the Saudi Government any excuse for complaining that it was beir^ asked to negotiate under a threat were pointed out, and it was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should consult Sir Andrew Ryan on the point, ^he conclus ions of the meetir^: were as follows:- (a) that the best prospect of advance was by an informal conference at Bahrain, with the assistance of the Political Agent, of the nature referred to above. (h)/7. (b) that it was desirable that this conference should take place at the earliest possible date, not only on general grounds, but because of the recent purchase by the Saudie of a steamer probably for use in the Rasa traffic, and the danger that oil development in Has a might lead to a development of the port of Ras Tanura, Further, it was admittedly desirable from all points of view that a friendly agreement should be reached without delay between these two States, whose interests were to so large an extent interdependent. (c) that in the light of the considered opinion of the Board of Trade on the extent to which and the manner in which it would be possible for the Bahrain Goverment to retaliate against individuals indulgirg in direct transhipment, and of Sir Andrew Ryan's view on the question of the line to be taken with the Saudi Government, the whole question should be further discussed with Colonel Fowle on his arrival with a view to reaching a decision as to the line to be followed by the Bahrain representatives at the conference. (d) The Board of Trade undertook to discuss the situation generally informally with the B.I.S.N.Co., with particular reference to the possibility of the imposition of port dues. 5 3Z-S•? ft ^ A-p /&gt;W ^W / ^ (a) rne Bin Jiluwi freement .

W. !• 7th April 1933, Dear Marker, With reference to our discussion yesterday at the meeting on the Bahrain transit dues, I write to say that the point on which we are anxious for a definite ruling from the Board of Trade is the extent and the conditions subject to which the Bahrain Government, having regard to general international practice, could deal 'by retaliatory measures with the threat to the prosperity of their port constituted by the efforts which are being made by interested parties to avoid the payment of transit dues at Bahrain on goods consigned to Ibn Baud's Hasa ports. The principal methods of evasion are by overside delivery outside Bahrain territorial waters, by direct shipment in vessels not calling at Bahrain or using Bahraini harbour facilities, or by through shipment in vessels which, without disembarking any of their Hasa cargo or paying transit dues on it, do in fact use Bahrain harbour facilities going to or returning from the Hasa coast* 2. The State at present charges a transit due of 2^ on goods consigned to Hasa» No port charges are levied at Bahrain and we understand that the transit due actually charged ooes not in practice cover the cost of providing harbour lacilities, supervision, etc# at Bahrain. While the position is not quite clear, it appears, from the correspondence we have had, tirst, that cargoes for the Hasa coast are likely to be too small by themselves to fill a single vessel - in other words, that the average ship will find it to its advantage to combine a shipment i'or Hasa with a shipment for Bahrain* Secondly, at any rate in tne case of certain points on the Haaa coast, that vessels must ■ lighten themselves at Bahrain if they arc to make the Hasa coast* 'wker E 8(1 ., 3./ Tpada. ' I (Muf8# The steps which the State has contemplated taking to deal with the threat to its prosperity referred to above are, the 'repatriation' of alien merchants living in Bahrain who indulge in the traffic to which exception is taken; secondly, the refusal to steamers engaging in the traffic of anji lacili.ies in Bahrain harbours and of permission to land cargo in Bahrain* 4* ihe general sense of the meeting yesterday was against 'repatriation', and I need not make further reference to it in this letter. o* Bahrain is not, of course, a party to any of the international shipping conventions, hut in accordance with our general policy we are anxious that her practice, so nearly as possible after allowance for special local conditions, shall conlorm to the general line of those conventions. We should therefore be grateful if you could let us know whether either under general international practice dr for any other reason a refusal of facilities such as the State has under consideration would be a legitimate step. If, in the view of the Board of Traae it would not, could they make any suggestion as to methods by which pressure could be brought to bear on offending shipping? As I explained yesterday, the question is one of much importance to Bahrain, particularly in view of her present economic difficulties. Indirectly it is also of considerable importance to His Majesty^ Government, for if Bahrain loses the transit trade or the bulk of it and the financial situation becomes very serious we may be faced with a demand for some contribution. 6e For convenience I might isolate the different issues.

('b) Ships en route to Hasa passing through Bahrain territorial w aters, but not usin^ Bahrain harbour facilities* Would any retaliatory action, and if so what, be possible and legitimate in these cases? (It could, of course, be taken only on the occasion of a subsequent visit of such a ship to Bahrain)# \ (c) Ships en&gt;/ap.in^ in oversiae delivery of ^.oods inten ded lor Hasa outside Bahrain territorial waters* ^ Would the State be justified in refusing harbour, etc# facilities to such ships as a deterrent measure? at -4 * ( d ) SMos (as in the case of the &gt;t AHMADI H ) touching at Bahrain en route for Hasa li^htenin^ themselves by discharging cargo co nsigned to Bahrain, but, since no transhioaent took Place, p aying no transit charge on the Hasa cargo in their hold# Would the State (subject to the provisions of any special agreement that might be in force with Bin Saud) be entitled to charge transit dues on the Hasa cargo (particularly as no port dues are levied) despite the fact that it had not teen transhipped? If not, ould they be entitled to retaliate against such shipping on the lines suggested in paragraph 3 above? 7# It is unnecessary to consider the case of transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters from sailing ships into dhows, since this can be dealt with by the strict application of the terms of the Agreement of 1920 with Bin Saud, whi ch/■' i 1 which provides lor tree transhipment in such circumstances only when transhipment is from steamers# B# I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner # I understand that you have 'been so kind as to arrange with the F.&lt;Ss 0. that they should see us next Tuesday to discuss the question generally, and the opportunity could he taken to consider both the desirability of imposing port dues at Bahrain as one method of dealing with the situation, and Johnstone^ suggestion about tonnage discrimination. ^oure sincerely, J.

Furtaer consideration nere, in consultation with Resident, tias led to following modification of proposal. It Has not been possible to devise any practicable measures for preventing method recently adopted by Saudi Govern ment for avoiding payment of Bahrain transit dues without thereby discriminating unduly against Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, present two per cent duty which applies only to 'neighbouring mainland of Arabia* (meaning Saudi ports and qatar) constitutes definite preferential treatment in favour of Saudi Government, as goods transhipped at Bahrain for any other destination would pay full duty of five per cent or higher rates recently imposed on some articles. (In practice only other destination is stated to be Persia, in which case goods are purchased in Bahrain and so would in any case have paid full duty). It appears therefore that if satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, e .g. on lines of Bin Jiluwi arrangement ( of which Acting Political Resident has been asked to send you further particulars), if Possible with addition of sane kind of friendly agreement to s u.e Bahr&amp;in against the heavy losses which would result by ahy general adoption of method adopted in AHMEDI case, the only alternative satisfactory to Banrain would be to raise transit duty to three per cent or more. This would appear Justifiable since it would amount merely to diminution of Preference hitherto accorded. _ It is proposed that Bahrain representat ives/-2- representatives at proposed conference snould, ir necessary, indicate tnis in friendly manner* Unless you see objection you may approach Saudi Government in general sense you propose but omitting refer ence to non-increase of dues and to Bahrain fiscal autonomy see Government or India telegram to India Oifice, ^0 .208, ^ard January. You may suggest that agreement for fixed - ed at period snould be ainland you snould I k try,by whatever means you think best, to secure presence of TAWIL at conference. If necessary you may defer approaching Saudi Government till present stage of Trans-Jordania negotiations is over, but it is desirable that their concurrence should be obtained and a conference arranged at earliest possible opportunity. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. • (Copy forwarded for information to P.A.,Bahrain under P.L.No.472-S of 6/5/33i.

Board of Trade. India Office. iiB -11 Mr. Laithwaite referred to the conclusions of the meeting of 6th April and to the developments which had taken place since that date. In the first place the Board of Trade had advised that in the case of ships such as the 'Ahmedi' touching at Bahrein en route for Has&amp; and lightening themselves hy discharging cargo consigned to Bahrein but, since no transhipment took place, paying no transit charge on the Hasa cargo in their hold, the imposition of a duty on the Hasa cargo might he defensible, though they did not much favour action of this nature and would prefer in any event that some phrase other than 'transit' dues should be used. No retaliatory action would in their view be Justified against ships which, en route to Hasa, either did not , Pass through Bahrein territorial waters, or, while Passing jthrough those waters, did not use Bahrein harbour Acuities, or which engaged in overside delivery of goods intended for Hasa outside Bahrein territorial waters. Secondly, discussion with the P.&amp; 0. had shown that Company would see strong objection to the Institution 01 port aues at Bahrein ana that a tonnage discrimination '^■inst vessels bound for Hasa would not be feasible. . -Finally/Finally, 3ir Andrew Ryan had now expressed his views, which were shared by trie Political Resident, on the general .question of tactics. Ke re contended that the Saudi Government shoula he informed at the outset of our correspondence with them that the 1920 arrangement was regarded as unilateral and terminable. He advised further uh&amp;t it ua &amp; ht ea,se matters if the tasK of the conference were expressed to be the production of a working agreement for a period of, say, 3 to 5 years in the first place; and that it might be preferable to say nothing in our official jconminication to the Saudi Government about the Bin Jiluwi and iwarzuk Agreements. ii.ee bin^ agreed generally not to pursue further the question of port dues or of tonnage discrimination, and, bubjeco to the modification that it would be preferable to say nothing or very little about the grant of fiscal autonomy to Bahrein, to approve the general line of tactics su &amp; ^ested by the Minister. Colonel Fowle mentioned in this connection that the precise degree of authority of the sin Jiluwi Agreement was by no means clear. It was quite Possible that it was merely a local arrangement entered iflto without reference to Ibn Saud, Sli—Laithwa ite said that the next Question was that 0x ^ Actios to be adopted by Bahreini representatives ^ the proposed conference. It looked at though the only ' :s&amp;pon with whl ch we could lumlsh them was a threat to ■apose dues on the Hasa cargo ovessels such as the 'Ahmed 1' which called at Bahrein en route to Hasa ports. i.ould oe necessary to use this weapon with care both on ^ternational and other grounds. kllf—Warner said the Foreign Office were averse from tills threat, while recognising that consideration must/- 3 - iZf 111 must be given to the interests of Bahrein it was important to avoid any action which, 'by prejudicing our general i relations with Ihn 3aud, might prejudicially affect matters oi major importance such as the Transjordan negotiations. The oest course seemed to he to work at the proposed corxference for a friendly agreement on the lines of the Bin Jiluwi arrangements, possibly accompanied by a 'gentleman s understanding' that 'Ahmedi' cases would not recur; out that if they Qid it would be necessary for the Baarein Government to consider retaliatory action. .yA-kQIL^lj:—^ o ■ 1.6 and i^r» Lit.hwaite &gt; while recognising the; leiC6 of the foreign Office objections, felt strongly at the same time that the chances of a satisfactory agreement woula be much improved if it was possible to furnish the Bahrein! representatives with some weapon for use if the Se^udis proved intransigent. Gases of the 'Ahiuedi' type were a serious problem, and likely to become still more so in the event of the Saudis acquiring steamers of taeii own, though admittedly vessels oi a certain draught i%ht evade any question of dues by calling at Has Tanura ^nd discharging Hasa cargo there before discharging cargo -t D-ahrein. Moreover, while there were obvious objections ^ a narked discrimination, the Hasa-Bahrein situation presented special features which had resulted in the 1 oi 1920 and which might be regarded as justifying some degree of special provision. After considerable further discussion, Mr&gt; Marker ^gSotiriif,, in particular, that a duty might be Imposed on Hasa cargoes, possibly unaer the name of a 'customs Cor ituoi charge' il justifiable on the ground of preventing ^Eling, it appeared that all the suggestions made for ^rcumventing evasion of Bahrein transit dues were open to the/tlie otijection either of constituting a specific ^discrimination against Saudi goods or of imposing an undesirable tax on British shipping. Gol ondl Fowle said that if it proved impossible to find satisfactory arguments with which we could arm the Bahrein! representatives in the forthcoming conference the only alternative was to allow them to deal with the question on quite general lines, and endeavour to make at the conference a friendly agreement of the most satislactory type possible. He was not himself v/ithout hopes that when the two parties got together results would te achieved which in practice would be satisfactory, even 11 they did not conform in all respects to western standards. The main thing was to reach some agreement, however provisional, which could be reconsidered later if difficulties arose. After further discussion Mr. Warner suggested that the Bahrein! representatives might take the line at the ^omerence that they had made a very substantial concession in 1920 in lowering the transit due on goods for the Hasa irom o% to 2%; that in existing economic conditions it ffas essential for them to seek an increase in their avenue; ana that after careful consideration the conclusion l ^ a ueen reached that in the circumstances it would be Pessary to raise their general transit due on goods for nasa from 2% (which was understood to represent a '-f^rentiai rate in existing conditions) to 3% or above; ^ the interests of the two States being closely they would be prepared to explore other ?0 ssibilities of increasing the revenue derived from the Cerentially treated goods destined for the Kasa, e.g. an/tzx //&gt;~ y ff / / - 5 - an agreement on the general Ijjies of the Bin Jiluwi Agreement, supplemented by a 'gentleman's agreement' in respect of direct consignments such as that carried by the 'Ahmedi'. Some play might possibly also be made over the retention of the concession which had been made to 3in Saud in respect of the passing of baled goods unopened on payment of a charge of Rs.^0 per bale. The meeting generally agreed that action on these lines seemed in all the circumstances the most hopeful course. As regards procedure it was agreed that as a first stage the Foreign Office, m reply to Sir Andrew Byan 1 s telegram No.69 of 17til April, should outline the general line of tactics which it was proposed to adopt ana should authorise him to make the necessary approach to the Saudi Government. Copies of this telegram would be sent to the Government of India and to Bushire. Formal instructions to the Political Resident would have to wait until 3ir Andrew Ryan's comments had been received ana the reaction of the Saudi Government to his communication to them ascertained.

In view of the doubt regarding the procedure in ,, Ahmedi H case and goods unloaded over-side outside territorial waters, and in order to secure maximum of elasticity, I have defined position as being that ''Government of Bahrain cannot, in view of these facts (i .e. port improvements and changed methods since 1920) and of their present financial necessities, be expected to waive payment of transit dues on any goods, however handled, which derive benefit from the facilities which they afford'. This leads up to the contention that the 1920 Concession was unilateral and terminable and to the proposal for conference to study all questions which have arisen, with a view to eventual embodiment, in an exchange of notes of a solution 'which might be made operative if necessary for fixed period', I think that this language allows the freest possible field for discussion at the conference.

Reply goes on to say following on Incident which provoked Saudi note of November 15th last Nejdi merchants pressed for creation of a port on Sfeudi) coast and that arrangements were made for ships and goods to go direct to Ras Tanura. Saudi Government do not 7 /1 eh to stand in the way of any arrangements which Bahrain may consider it to its advantage to make for transit trade provided goods in transit for S(audl) Arabia are not treated less favourably than those destined for other countries.

Puad foreshadowed this reply in conversation on 19th May. He referred in ohscure language to our con tention that 19S0 arrangement was unilateral anl tenninable, to which I replied that throughout prolonged discussions leading up to our proposal we had had no doubt on that point. Saudi note ignores it and also Ignores proposal for conference. Juad made out that much progress had been made with port at Has Tanura. I said that it was because further developments might affect the outlook of Saudi Government no le ss than that of Balrain that we had suggested possibility of agreement for fixed period. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi happened to call on me yesterday. Conversation turned on this subject. He suggested that Bahrain ought to extend more liberal treat ment to goods imported in Ibn Saud's name e^n if intended for Government as opposed to purely personal use. He rather laughed at the idea that Ras Tanura could be regarded seriously as a port at present but ended by asking me Aether I thought the British India Company ^ould be willing to call there, say, once a nonth. I naturally evaded this but urged advantages of our proposal for a conference of experts to concert mutually advantageous agreement, answer to which I had not yet received. Qusaibi was non-committal but spoke of tryingto arrange sonething on his return to Bahrain. I find situation Tsaffling. I cannot Judge how far 8(audi) Government, realising difficulty of contesting unilateral character of 1920 arrangement, are trying to bluff us with threat of cutting out Bahrain altogether. Subject to other views 1 think best course Might hejy express regret at refusal of conference proposal: to say that it leaves Bahrain Government no alternative but to notify termination of 1920 arrangement: and then to watch developments for two or three months before taking any definite final decision. I do not know by what right Ibn Saud claims most-favoured-nation treatment but I gather from your 58 that Qatar alone has hitherto shared benefit of two per cent, transit duty. - Ryan.Department.

The firsi is the tactics to be pursued vis p vis the Saudi Government, and subject to your remarks I think the best line to take would be that indicated b.y Minister in the last paragraph of his telBgraci 118: M Subject to other views I think best course might be to express regret at refusal of conference proposal; to say that it leaves Bahrain Government no alternative but to notify termina tion of 1920 arrangement; and then to watch developments for twe or three months before taking any definite final decision.' The second point is whether the Saudi Government, as indicated by Minister,(tide first part of the last paragraph his telegram 118), are trying to bluff us with a threat of cutting out Bahrain altogether, or whether they, i.e. the Saudi Government, can really make Ras Tanura into a proper port. #ith/ {Signature) (Designation) N y i V.

Denne with regard to » Has Tanurah and he is of the opinion that it would not be safe for vessels over 340 ft. long to use the harbour on account of the bad holding ground and the narrow expanse of water which is not more than at Mohammerah. (When Capt. Denne mentioned 34d ft. as the maximum length I am sure he was reckoning the ^a 1 as a little longer but on looking up Lloyd's Register this morning I find their length is given as 330 ft. only). The approaches to Ras Tanurah are not difficult In fine weather but there is always a risk of poor visibility on account of sand. Two buoys one on each of the shoals to the •astward should be laid or better still beacons should be built and a flagsta T not less than 50 ft. high should be erected at the point. The 'Persian Gulf Pilot w mentions that there was a flagstaff but it is doubtful if it is still standing, While it might be a difficult matter for steamers to use the anchorage on the inside (or to the westward) of Ras Tanurah there does not appear to be any reason why vessels should not anchor about a mile off the point - just a little south ofeast. There would be no protection from the weather but they would just have to use the open anchorage as they do at Dubai, In any case Capt. Denne considers that the whole place shouH be thoroughly surveyed as the present survey is not adequate. If vessels were to use the port as it is at present he thought that Underwriters would probably object. Capt. Denne was at Has Tanurah in 190S and on that occasion the cargo was landed by dhows at Katif; there were then no godowns and not even a house. I should think that Underwriters would expect some sort of protection for cargo. Tanurah I am not clear as to where the cargo would be landed. From what I could gather from Capt. Denne it seems that dhows have difficulty in reaching Katif where they can only go along- side on the top of high water. This as you can understand would probably mean delays to steamers. It might be possible however to land cargo Just inside the point.

Dear Mr. Marker, With reference to your call here with Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office, on the subject of shipments to mainland ports via Bahrein, 1 think you will be interested to have our latest advices as to developments in this connection, and I therefore enclose a copy of a letter I have received by this mail from our Managing Agents in Calcutta. I trust that the conference which has been arranged between the two local Oovernments concerned will result in some arrangement which will be satisfactory to all parties. Yours sincerely, (3gd). L.M.

Post Box No. 1637 ^ Calcutta, 15th June, 1933. The v ecretary. British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. London. i^ear Sir, MAINIANU mm-.. VTA RAHHTCTT!. With reference to your Private and Confidential letter No. 110 of the 13th April and our reply No.158 of the 4th ultimo on the subject of shipments to mainland ports Bahrein we have not to advise that the situation has developed and, in order to keep you informed of the progress of events, we give you below a sirnmary of what has occurred. A conference between the Hedjaz Sovernment and the Bahrein Sorernment has been proposed and endeavours are being made to hold it shortly. In the meantime the Hedjaz Government are pressing shippers of rice to arrange for direct shipments to be taken to 3as Tanurah probably with the object in view of strengthening their position at the coming conference. The Bahrein Government are doing all they can to prevent shipment to mainland ports direct and our Bahrein Agents inform us that, in the event of the Company arranging for this direct shipment, the attitude of the Bahrein Government •ill be unfriendly. ihe Bahrein Government apparently have in ^ew that if airect shipment is made to a mainland port it will »eaken their case for the imposition of the transit duty now in force ana it will eventually mean that cargo for mainland ports ^1 be shipped direct and not via Bahrein as hitherto. It is flter therefore that if the iedjaz Government can arrange for a 'isignment to go forward to a mainland port before the conference 'held they will be in a strong position to insist on the 2/ as it duty being abolished. The Hedjaz Government are l|» , n^xng pressure to bear on the two largest shippers of cargo ' !s tined for the Hedjaz, naiely Mr. Elmarzook and Mr. Ali Reza ; - 1 -arrange for the direct shipment of 30,000 bags available from jalcutta and Rangoon for prompt shipment to Ras Tanrah and these Rippers have approached us to arrange tonnage. They have ,reduced letters from Ministers of the Hedjaz Oovernment deiianding (hat, in the event of the Company being unable or unwilling to rovide the necessary tonnage, the shippers should arrange for an outside steamer to lift the cargo and we understand Mr, Sheriff iassam of the Eastern Stean Navigation Company has offered to :erth a steamer at Rs. 16/- per ton. ue desire, if possible, to avoid doing anything which would antagonise the Bahrein Jovernnient, but we consider that their attitude in this matter is entirely unreasonable and in our opinion if the trade for |:as Tanurah is likely to develop the Company should be ready to eater for it, particularly as it is practically certain that the cargo for mainland ports will be cargo which under the present lirrangements would have been shipped by the Company's Subsidiary hlf Mail steamers to Bahrein. In any case to refuse to cater for the trade to mainland ports would not assist the Bahrein kernment in any way as the cargo would still go forward by outside vessels. Although, as mentioned above, we are prepared to berth steamers for the direct trade to mainland ports, we have been Uable to do so owing to our Nautical Advisers being definitely f r the opinion that the approaches to Has Tannrah are too 'langerous unless aids to navigation are provided in the shape p two buoys. Y*e have accordingly informed shippers that we are ®eaiitime unable to offer them a steamer owing to the approaches to jks Tanurah being insufficiently marked, but have indicated to leai that, should the Hedjaz Government be prepared to place two 5, toys in positions considered by our Marine Superintendent to :e suitable, we woula be prepared to send a vessel there. t.e i l^ticipate that in order to strengthen their case at the coming Inference the Hedjaz Grovernment will be prepared to supply the s in question and they already indicated their willingness tose VOi so over a year ago, but as it is possible that they have no capable of giving them expert advice as to the most suitable ^ition in which to anchor the buoys, we have given Bombay puts authority to give then the services of a Company's [ficer in case of need and at the request of the Hedjaz ^emment. As mentioned above, the attitude of the Bahrein Grovernment is kely to become unfriendly towards the Company if a steamer is thed for mainland ports. ^e do not think that the Bahrein emment is in a position to injure the Company's interests to my extent and we hope on fuller realisation of the situation hey will see that the Company have acted in the only way open them in their capacity as transporters by sea. We shall advise you of any further developments in this wnnection. •V We are, dear 3ir, Yours faithfully, (Sgd). MACKINNON 'ACKENZIE &amp; CO.

In continuation of our conversation and correspondence on the above subject,we have now heard from our Bombay Office that in view of the fact that they have declined to berth a steamer direct to mainland ports,Messrs Ibrahim Yusuf Zainal Ali Reza have arranged with the owners of the s.8 'Haideri' to charter this vessel for the carriage of goods from Rangoon,Calcutta,Karachi and Bombay to Ras Tanurah and possibly Bahrain. Our Principals desire us to point out that in view of their | cmnplying with the wishes of the Bahrain Government and the | Political Department to discourage shipments direct to the mainland, I they are losing considerable traffic in not competing with such vessels as the above. They also desire us to emphasise the loss 1 this development entails on the revenues of the Bahrain State and the urgent need for reconsideration of the State's attitude towards j this question. It is apparent that trade demands direct shipments to the ports on the mainland and our Company will sooner or later be obliged to cater for this traffic to avoid competition from outside tonnage. Under these circumstances it does not appear equitable that other Steamship Companies be allowed to cater for the traffic when it is expressly desired that the British India Company should not undertake it. We shall be glad to hear from you in this matter. Also whether I any further developments have taken place in regard to the Conferenc contemplated between the Hedjaz and Bahrain Government, on the subjec of Transit Traffic. we would mention that Messrs Ibrahim Yusuf Zainal Ali Reza have I their ov/n office at this port. Further,that it is hardly likely j that the steamer 'Haideri' will be able to pay for her voyage out the freights received for the mainland shipments and that she (2)is 'bound to 'bring forward cargo for Bahrain also. The small shipments coming forward by the B.I vessels at this season would also support this view.Copy of letter 1To:G/286 dated the 19th July 1933 from the Political Agent,Bahrain,to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government,Bahrain, With reference to our conversation of yesterday,! have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter fto:P/71 dated the 16th July 1933 from the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited on the subject of direct shipments to mainland ports and to request that I may be informed of the views of the Bahrain Government on the questions raised therein.Ill ' Copy of letter No:C/98 dated tiie 10th August 1933 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent,Bahrain. I have the honour to acknowledge your C/286-1.a/13 dated the 19th July 1933. The Bahrain Government appreciates the friendly action of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited in endeavouring to discourage shipments direct to the mainland. If this traffic became regular it would injure both this Government and the British India Steam Navigation Company financially. In the case of the present steamer the Government can take no action as from information which 1 have received I understand that the cargo consists of 32,000 bags of rice destined for His kajesty King Bin Sa^d and 2,(^0 bags which are the property of the owner of the Ship. Further I am informed that the Ship is sailing direct from Bombay to Ras Tanurah and having no cargo for Bahrain she does not propose calling here. I believe it unlikely that a direct boat will be sent to Has Tanurah except once each year when His Majesty King Bin SaUid is accustomed to import a large quantity of rice which he distributes to the Arabs of Hasa,thi3 takes place each year about this time. I have discussed the matter with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad who feels that in this case we can take no action. I am aware that the British India Steam Navigation Company consider that the Government would be well advised to reduce the 2 per cent direct transhipment duty,but His Excellency Shaikh Hamad is not prepared to take this action.19/£12 Telegram En clair. irolitical Resident, -^ushire.
