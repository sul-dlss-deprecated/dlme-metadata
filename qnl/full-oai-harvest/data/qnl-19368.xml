The letter also states that although Pelly's presence at Herat was fortunate in the circumstances there, but that as the situation in Afghanistan was becoming more precarious he would do well to move quickly for India.The letter concludes by referring to the enclosure of the latest copy of Galignani's messenger and the journals of Constantinople (no longer enclosed) and reporting that the Papal Army had been completely destroyed, that Aneona had been taken and that General Christophe-Louis-Leon Juchault de Lamorici√®re had been captured, with a plot to dethrone Emperor Napoleon III being found amongst his papers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023882889.0x000015#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
