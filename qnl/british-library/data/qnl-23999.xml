Dear colonel Hay, As you asked me to do, I consulted Belgrave regarding the observance of the King Emperor's Birthday. Ke agreed that if anything were done in the way of calls it would be right not to go in for half measures, but to revert to the pre-war custom of calls on the political Agent by the Shaikh with uniforms, guards of honour, etc., and for the political Agent also to be at home to the British, American, Arab, Indian, and Persian communities as is done on proclamation Day. There are, however, some practical difficulties .about this, e.g., the British com munity has increased greatly in size, it does not get a holiday on the King's Birthday, and it would, therefore, probably find it very difficult to call — and after all, the King's Birthday should be an occasion for the British community mainly. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 9th of June, 1947. 2. There is another point. With the new order of things in India, it seems hardly likely that Proclamation Day will last very much longer, so I suppose that the King’s Birthday will, in future, take its place though the climate of the month In which it falls is not a very good one here for celebrations. 3. On the whole, I am not very keen on reviving the pre-war ' practic^ I submit that whatever is done should be the same in all three Agencies. Yours sincerely, 1 The JTon’ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.a.

Imposing new Government offices have been constructed in the centre of Manama end there has been ru*h new building elsewhere. The aipenltles of life for the population of Bahrain are being rapidly improved and we hope that if God wills there will be much further progress made during this new year, the position regarding the supply of foodstuffs and other necessities of life has also been satisfactory and prices have except in a few cases been stable. In particular rice is new more plenti ful and cheaper than it used to be. Law and order have been maintained throughout the year and Your Highness is to be con gratulated on the peace and prosperity which has prevailed. m all pray to God that It may continue. In particular we hope that the Bahrain Petroleum Company will be successful in finding new oil deposits and sc add to the prosperity of Bahrain. last April His Majesty the King was graciously pleased to confer on Your Highness 1 uncle Shaikh iuhiimmad bin Isa an honorary Commandership of the Order of the British lapire and I had the honour of presenting the decoration to him when wo celebrated His Majesty’s Birthday. I am very sorry that his health has compelled him to go to Egypt and that he is net able to be present here today. The general political and economic situation throughout the world is still the cause of grave anxiety, though the threat of war which I referred to in my speech last year appears to have receded. The insidious disease of coffimmisr* is still a menace in many parts of the world and wo should be thangful that up to date Bahrain has avoided infection. On the economic side it Is a matter for satisfaction that the revaluation of sterling has had little or no effect on the cost of living in Bahrain. I thank Your Highness for the warv friendship which you have shown to this Residency and the Politics! Agency during the past year and for all your co-operation and courtesies. 1 also thank all the rest of you for your friendship and co operation. We endeavour to assist you all to the best of our ability and if there have been any deficiencies we hope you will ascribe them to shortage of staff from which we suffered, especially during the hot weather. The situation in this res pect has now Improved and will, I hope continue to Improve. It has been due in some part to lack of accommodation. An arrange ment has now been made for the Residency to 'take over part ©f the Haval Base here in Jufalr and as you see some of our new houses are already marly completed and we hope to go ahead shortly with the construction of other buildings including a house for the Political Resident. It is a happy coincidence that today is also the birthday of the Prophet and I offer all the i uslims present my greetings on this occasion. Once more I wish Your Highness and all of you a very Happy and Prosperous Bm Year.No. If of -BOA POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. lOtn May, I960,, Dear Agency, \ vVill you please note that His Majesty's Birthday is to be celebrated this year on thursday the Sth June 1950 and also the Ruler^J of yotar territory accordingly.

On the morning of the 8th of June, the acting Ruler of Sharjah, Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr called upon the Political Officer, Trucial Coast at the Agency. The ancient cannon outside the Ruler*s Fort were discharged, but owing to the fact that the pieces fall from their mountings whenever discharged, a full Royal Salute was not fired. 3. Calls were also received from members of the British Community and from various Sharjah merchants. 4. On the morning of the 8th June, Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, Ruler of Umm al QaTwain, who had been invited to come to the Agency, was informed by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast in the presence of the Shaikh of Sharjah of His Majesty*s pleasure in the award of an M.B.E.

I enclose a copy of a letter received from Shaikh Ahmad. 5. The Ruler of Ajman called at the Agency on 10th June, upon his return from the desert. 6.
