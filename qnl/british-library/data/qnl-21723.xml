G. as a permanent R.A.F. base. The Political Resident has suggested that in the event either of lease or sale it Trould be advisable to provide specifically that any oil royalties deriving from the Island should remain ttith the Lultan since otherwise the thought of what he might be losing would make the Sultan drive a much harder bargain with H. M. G. The Govern ment of India, however, feel that discussion on oil royalties is certain to complicate negotiations with the Sultan and, therefore, advise that the Resident should not volunteer reservation of the royalties to the Sultan. We are inclined to support the Political Resident's view, for it is hardly likely that the point will escape the Sultan's notice, and in any case if the matter is not definitely settled at the time of the negotiations, there might be serious misunderstanding later. We do not think, however, that H.M,G. should attempt any estimation of the value of the oil royaltie. or introduce them as a factor into the bargaining. 2. Whether the question is of any great practical importance it is difficult to say in the absence of any information as to the prospects of oil—being-fetmd-on-Maairah-Island, but it is clear that the purchase or lease of the Island will raise certain legal questions vis-a-vis the Oil Company, and we have examined the question here from the legal point of view. I enclose a copy of a note by our Legal Adviser. It seems to us that there are really two separate points to be considered: (1) the payment of oil royalties, and the position of the Oil Company in the event of our purchase of the Island. ( 2 ) the necessity of securing that any oil operations on the Island would not interfere with the R.A.F.'s The Hon, M.R. Bridgeman, Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power, (Petroleum Division), 7, Millbank, S.W, 1 / re quirement s3 requirements there, (it is perhaps relevant to observe in the latter connection that Masirah Island covers an area of some 250 square miles and contains seme hilly country so that clearly the aerodrome facilities required will net occupy the whole of it). 3. As regards the first point, the 'leased area' of Petroleum Concession Ltd's Concession is defined in Article 1 (a) of their Agreement with the Sultan dated 22fth June 1937 as 'The Sultanate cf Muscat and Gnan including all islands and territorial waters appertaining thereto /except Gwadur/ 7 '. It is clear, therefore, that Masirah Island forms part of the 'leased area' granted to the Company by the Sultan, and in cur view the sale by the Sultan to us cf the Island would not affect the Concession, and the Company would still be entitled to exercise their rights thereunder. Assuming that it is decided to leave the royalty rights with the Sultan all that would appear to be necessary is to include a statement to that effect in the Agreement relating to the sale. If however we were to take over the royalties ourselves, presumably we should need a new Concession Agreement with the Oil Company confiming the rights in the Island granted to them by the Sultan. A# As regards the second point, Article 7 cf the 'General Agreement' dated 27th September 1938 between H.M.G. and Petroleum Development (Gnan &amp; Dhofar) Ltd. , provides that 'notwithstanding anything contained in the Concession Agreements between the Company and the Sultkn, the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy, and shall not include in the areas to be acquired or utilised for the purposes of its operations, the surface of any sites which may have been selected by the Sultan or any person authorised by him for defence purposes, for aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases...'. So far as a lease is concerned, Article 1 (b) of the Company's Agreement with the Sultan of 22+.th June 1937 reads as follows 'Nothing in this agreement shall be read as restricting - in any way - the right of the Sultan to grant to others a lease or permit over the surface rights of an area or areas to be used for the purpose cf constructing an aerodrome and appurtenances thereto for either aeroplanes cr seaplanes; and the surface rights over such area or areas if and so granted shall be entirely excluded for the purpose of this agreement.' There therefore appears no reason to doubt that we can secure the R. A.F. 's requirements on the Island under the terms of the existing Agreements, though as you will see our Legal Adviser is /incline4 ■ Jinclined to think that it T7ould be vise, either in the case of sale or lease of the Island, to obtain some confirmation from the Oil Company safeguarding H.M.G-.'s position. -This might perhaps be done in the form of an exchange of letters with them, and might be taken up after the conclusion of the negotiations with the Sultan. 5. be should be grateful to have the views of the Petroleum Division on those questions, and any other observations that you may -.'ish to offer. I am sending a copy of this letter to Dean (Air Ministry), Trend (Treasury), Hankey (Foreign Office), and ^*.r Bernard Reilly (Colonial Office) for any comments that they may care to add. Yours sincerely, Hi PMSfcNote by Legal Adviser, India Office There is, in the first place, no question but that Masirah Island forms part of the 'leased area' under the concession granted by the Sultan to the Company. If the principles of English lav/ applied to the case the effect of an outright sale (or cession) of the island by the Sultan would depend on whether the concession amounted to what is termed a 'profit-a~prondrc ' (i.e., a right to enter on and remove something from the land) - in which case it would be an interest in the land and unaffected by the sale, or whether it amounted merely to a licence - in which case it v/ould not be binding on the land but would merely be a personal matter between the Sultan and the Company. The right h^re actually granted by the Sultan was 'the exclusive right to explore, search for, drill for, produce and win' the various substances mentioned, and I take it that even during the Option period the Company were to have the right to remove any substance thus won. In tho circumstances, the sale of the island by tho Sultan would not, I think, affect the concession and the Company would still bo entitled to exorcise their rights thereunder. I thiiik it would be unsafe to roly on the assumption that in such circumstances would be fully protected either by Article 1(b) of the Concession or by Article 7 of the Political Agreement - unless indeed that position was • confirmed and accepted by the Company. (intld.) K.M 0 I.K. 26 . 6 ./ i Ext. 2807/244 Dear Hankoy, India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. ^ July, 1944. Would you please refer to paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’s telegram 1295 of the 2nd June and paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s telegram 7743 of the 9th June, regarding the form of an Agreement of Retrocession in the event of it being decided to hand the Kuria Muria Islands back to the Sultan of Unseat in connection with the purchase or lease of Hasirah Island. The Deed of Cession of the Kuria Lluria Islands in 1854 does not appear to us to form a very appropriate model, and we have been considering what other form might be more suitable. The Bindings .Agreement (Approval) Act of 1934, covering an agreement with the Sultan of Perak regarding the retrocession of the Bindings, forms a precedent, but it would clearly bo preferable to avoid bringing the matter before Parliament by ,way of an Act if this can be avoided in the present case. It occurs to us, therefore, that a solution might be to include the retrocession of the Kuria Mnria Islands, if necessary, in a general agreement with the Sultan covering both the sale or lease of Hasirah Island and any condition as to oil royalties (see in the latter connection my letter of today to Bridgcman of the Petroleum Division). We should be glad to have the views of the Porcign Office on this suggestion and also on the precise form which such a general agreement with the Sultan should take. In paragraph 4 of his telegram No.1295 the Political Resident suggests that he will require full power from His Majesty/ The Hon. R.M. A.Hankey, Foreign Office, S.V7.1.V Majesty The King to sign a Deed of Retrocession* Assuming this to be the case, would you kindly advise what form such a 'power to sign' would take and what would be the procedure for obtaining it# I am sending a copy of this letter to Sir Bernard Reilly of the Colonial Office, whose views we should be gxad to have on the subject, and to Dean at the Air Ministry* Yours sincerely, pRItt- “T »k it cory EXT ♦ 52&amp;7/kk COLONIAL OFFICE, Downing Street 78120/1/44 21st July, 19H SECRET Will you please refer to my secret letter 78120/1/44 of the 26th June regarding the proposed purchase or lease of Masirah island* The Governor of Aden, Sir John Hall* is now in England and he has been consulted about these proposals.

A/s regards the future administration of Masirah, if acquired, Sir John Hall would have no ob jection to undertaking it from Aden if he were asked to do so, and if he had the necessary staff, but equally he sees no objection to the island being attached to the charge of the Tolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, as suggested in your letter of the 21st of June, although he thinks it possible that the Air Officer Ccnmanding at Aden might prefe that it should be controlled from Aden.
