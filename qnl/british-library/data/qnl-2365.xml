Minister for Foreign Affairs, who appeared to be well informed of the nature of the concession, promised to look the matter up, and spoke hopefully about the prospects of success. I could not specify details, as Wood has two drafts of the concession which do not tally, and has telegraphed to ask which is the one to work on. Wood subsequently saw Minister for Foreign Affairs, who gave him to understand that much would depend on the syndicate’s willingness to carry out original promise of a loan of 100,000L, or, better still, to increase offer.

Sazonof at Balmoral. Owing to his Excellency’s attention being at present engrossed with the Balkan crisis, he was unable to enter into a discussion of their subject matter. He told me, however, with regard to the suggested construction of a line from Khoremabad to Isfahan that, since he had returned to St. Petersburgh, it had been pointed out to him that, were we to ask for a first option, the Germans would probably at once apply for the second option, and then enquire whether we intended to construct the line or not. This would place the Russian Government in a serious dilemma, as it would be almost impossible for them to find the necessary capital in Russia. ) forwarded to me in your despatch No. 340, Very Confidential, of the 8th of this month, I have, &amp;c.

HIS Majesty’s Government recognise that there is force in the Imperial Govein- ment’s representations as to the advantages that might follow from closer commercial relations between the neighbouring countries of Asiatic Russia and Afghanistan, and from their co-operation in works of a civilising character, such as irrigation a fd the extirpation of the locust pest. They would, however, observe that, quite apart from the personal attitude of the Ameer, public opinion in Afghanistan does not at present appear to tolerate the idea of more intimate connection with countries beyond her borders, and that His Majestv’s Government, although themselves m treaty relations with the Ameer, suffer equally with the Russian Government from this state of feeling. For example, no general access to Afghanistan is enjoyed by Bntis ^ The policy of non-interference with Afghanistan having been deliberately adopted by this country, His Majesty’s Government would feel great difficulty m pressing the Ameer to accord to Russian subjects facilities which they are prec uded from asking for their own, and they do not think that any good result would follow from urging the Ameer to give a general recognition of the terms of article 3 of the Anglo-Russian invention h consulfc with the Government of India with a view to representing to the Ameer that it would be wise of him to act in a neighbourly spirit in such matters as would fall within the scope of that artic e. Afodmnkfan TTH As regards the importation of arms and ammunition into Afghanistan, His Majesty’s Government have been, and are, doing everything m their power at a heavy cost to British and Indian revenues to proven arms going overland into Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf for the use of Afghan tribesmen. Ibis traffic, fhey would observe, is now centred in Muscat, where been rendered imnossible owing to the claim made by the Fiench vroveinment, based uZ fheTr treaTy P “ns with the Sultan, that the trade in arms and ammunition should be free.

Kecently the . ultan o i useat has introduced a system of regulating the traffic in order to prevent the wholesale export of arms and ammunition, and His Majesty’s Government are now exerting their efforts to secure from the French Government the acceptance of this system. ^ As regards the presence in Afghanistan of lurkish military instructors, His Majesty’s Government would remark that their engagement is a mattei of internal administration, in regard to which it would be difficult foi them to make any representations to the Ameer, though they apprehend tliat the instiuctors have probably come under Chauvinistic influence in Turkey, and that their disposition is likely to be as anti-British as it is anti-Itussian. His Majesty s Government are disposed, however, to think that their number is less than that staled. If anything can be done, it would seem best to proceed by discouraging at Constantinople the engage ment of these instructors. Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. ( 2 .) Russian Consular Representation at Bombay. With regard to the suggested establishment of a British consulate at Tashkent, His Majesty’s Government recognise the difficulty felt by the Russian Government in complying with their request, on the ground that demands for a similar privilege would at once be made by other Powers. But they would point out that, so far as they are aware, Great Britain is the only European Power whose commercial interests in Russian Central Asia are on an appreciable scale, or whose subjects reside in those regions to any considerable number. The difficulties to which the absence of British consular representation has given rise are explained in the attached statement. In the circumstances His Majesty’s Government would again urge that there are strong grounds for the establishment of a British consulate at Tashkent, which do not exist in the case of any other Power. Should, however, the Itussian Government still find themselves unable to consider this proposal favourably, His Majesty’s Government would suggest that arrangements might be made— 1. To amend the passport regulations in Russian Central Asia so far as they press heavily on the Indian traders; and 2. To allow an assistant to the British consul-general at Meshed to pay periodical visits to the principal trade centres in Russian Turkestan—due notice of such visits being given to the Russian authorities—to deal with purely commercial matters affecting the interests of British subjects. Should the Russian Government see their way to grant these concessions, and fuithei to agree to the establishment of British consular posts at Krasnoyarsk and Nicolaiesk, and to the advancement of the vice-consul at Vladivostok to the status of consul, His Majesty s Government would not raise any further objection to the appointment of a Russian vice-consul at Bombay. Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. Grievances of British Subjects in Russian Central Asia. The principal grievances of British Indian subjects trading in Bokhara and Russian Turkestan are as follows :— 1. The delay caused to trade agents, and the consequent loss to business, entailed by the new passport regulations introduced in 1)09 2. The hardship suffered by British Indian subjects owing to the procedure adopted for dividing among creditors the estates of deceased or bankrupt debtors- ^ lDdian ^ ^ a ^ comparedTdth 3. The difficulty m realising the estates of deceased British Indian subjects.As regards 1 and 2, the position was fully explained to the Russian Government in Sir George Buchanan’s note to M. Sazonof dated the 27th February, 1911. With regard to 3, the difficulty is mainly due to the decision of the Russian Government in 1909 to insist on the strict observance of the law requiring claimants to appear before the proper district courts in Russia, either personally or by attorney. In view of the inconvenience involved to British Indian claimants, the Government of India proposed a reciprocal arrangement to cover the case of Russians dying in India, as well as of British Indians dying in Russia. This proposal was placed before the Russian Government in Mr. O’Beirne’s note of the 23rd October, 1910, to which no reply has yet been received. The following specific instances of the inconvenience to which British Indian subjects are liable to be put, owing to the absence of British consular representation, may be cited :— 1. The case of Abdul Rashid Hadji Mohammedinof, reported in Sir G. Buchanan’s despatch No. 57, 8th March, 1911, who was refused permission to remain at Kerki to wind up his affairs. The British Ambassador’s intervention on the man’s behalf was unsuccessful. 2. The case of Tiritsing, son of Nandarsing, and Surtaram, son of Seetarum, who were arrested at Samarkand at the beginning of the present year, apparently on the charge of being spies. The charge is believed to be quite without foundation. The men were kept in prison till the 14th June, 1912, when they were released on bail. The British Ambassador has made representations to the Russian Government with a view to the men’s trial being expedited, and their papers being returned to them. (See Sir G. Buchanan’s despatch No. 255, 17th August, 1912.) Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. (3-) Trans-Persian Railway. His Majesty’s Government share the view of the Russian Government^ that it is desirable to occupy the ground by securing an option for the boeiete d Etudes, whereby the two Governments will be in a position to say when and where a Trans- Persian line would be built. 4 n His Majesty’s Government have therefore no objection to the Russian Govern ment constructing a line to Tehran, and, subject to all the reserves and conditions already stipulated as to the route of the railway outside the Russian sphere, and that it shall not, without agreement with His Majesty’s Government, proceed Deyond the Russian sphere, have authorised His Majesty s Minister at Tehian to co-opera e with his Russian colleague to secure the said option for the Societe d Etudes The British group of the Societe d’Etudes have also been informed that they would be justified in sending to Tehran a representative to co-operate with represen tatives of the other groups of the societe to the same end. As regards the suggestion that the soeieth should be encouraged to make a big loan to the Persian Government, such action appears somewhat difficult, as theie is to be no Anglo-Russian guarantee. Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. (4.) British Railways in Persia.

Sazonofs assurance that, in view of its essential importance to British trade, he will not oppose it. . . Concerning the possible extension of the line to Burujird, situated m the ftussian sphere, a means of obviating any difficulty in the matter might be found if the Russian Government invoked the aid of British capital lor the construction ol the part in the Russian sphere, or for a line from Khoremabad to Ispahan, thereby rendering less important the branch from Khanikin to Tehran. With regard to further railway concessions in the neutral zone, His Majesty’s Government are quite prepared to discuss the matter with the Russian Government, and to request the syndicate to send out a representative to St. Petersburgh. His Majesty’s Government may ask Russia to consent to them in due course, it being understood that such consent would not be claimed as a matter of right until the Trans-Persian Railway shall have proceeded beyond the Russian sphere. As to railways in the British sphere such as Bunder Abbas to Kerman, His Majesty’s Government have no doubt that the Imperial Russian Government will admit that these are matters solely affecting British interests, but His Majesty’s Government would always he happy to keep the Imperial Russian Government informed of any project of railway enterprise in the British sphere. Any increase of the Persian public debt due to the construction of railways in the neutral zone may fittingly be dealt with in discussion between the two Governments. Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. (5.) Turco-Persian Frontier. The most recent reports from Constantinople are a good deal more satisfactory. His Majesty’s and the Russian representatives have suggested territorial concessions which could be made to Turkey in Zohab, but it is possible that it mav not be necessary to make them. I he British vice-consul at Kasr-i-Shirin is about to proceed to Bagdad to study the papers and advise as to the tribal conditions in the districts which mav be ceded. J His Majesty s Government are therefore of opinion that no useful purpose would be served by taking any further action at present. Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. oSir W.

It becomes increasingly desirable to show public opinion here that Anglo-Russian co-operation leads to something more than occupation of places in Persia by Russian troops. For this purpose it would be most valuable if the concession for Mohammerah- Khonemabad Railway could be put through ; it would not at all impair its value for this purpose if it coincided with the granting of a concession for one of the railways that Russia wants in the north.

Discussion of suitability of Khor Musa as railway terminus would be premature, ( but I concur that on general grounds His Majesty’s Government should, if possible, ; control allotment of the foreshore there. Probable Persian objections to an application by us to the sheikh (see Sir G. Barclay’s telegram No. 452 of 30th September last year) would hardly be consistent with the very precise wording of firman of 1903, which, while forbidding sale or transfer to foreigners of the properties, did not prohibit sheikh from leasing them. Objections of Government of India to article 4 of syndicate’s revised draft contract appear to be sound, but a revival of the original version of article 4 would be liable to the objection which Sir G. Barclay pointed out in his telegram to Bushire No. 240 of 21st September of last year. Apparently the best course would be an arrangement providing both for compensation and for direct arrangement with local chiefs. Please consult Cox on the above and as to whether an undertaking could not be obtained from the sheikh not to lease the foreshore to anyone but His Majesty’s \ Government or the Government of India, and telegraph your views (see also Mohammerah despatch to Bushire of 7th October, 1911).Sir, With reference to previous correspondence regarding the pro posed Moharnmera-Khorremabad Pailway I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign.. Affairs copy of a telegram that has been received, from the Government of India recommending the lease ofKhor Ikisa and islands from, the Sheikh of Mohammera. It 'would be premature at presert to discuss the snit ability of Khor Musa as a terminus for the railway. Th.e Marquess of Crewe understands that opinion is not unanimous on that point; and, if His Majesty 1 s Govem.m.ent becom.e financially interested in the conservancy of the Shat t-el-Arab, it may be rather to their interest to increase the traffic on that river by locating the terminus at Mohammera. But, apart from that, it appears desir able, on general grounds, that His Majesty's Government should, if possible, control the allotment of the foreshore at Kh.or Musa, and His; if 1 ■ ■ 11# His Lordship would accordingly support the recommendation.

Foreign Secret. Khor Musa. Cox reports that Anglo-Persian Oil Company contemplate laying pipe line to Khor Musa anchorage. Under Article III. of their concession from Sheikh and Article VI. of their agreement with Persian Government, this is their exclusive right. But this raises question of construction of wharves at Khor Musa. In view of possible terminus of Khoremabad railway there we consider it important that we should control allotment of foreshore and islands to prevent clash of British interests and to exclude foreign firms. Cox now recommends that we should lease Khor Musa and islands from Sheikh as before proposed in my telegram , of 8th November 1911 if suitable terms can be arranged. Khor Musa is W* recognised part of Fallahkhanyeh district granted to Sheikh in perpetuity by Shah’s firman of 1903. We concur. But difficulty arises from wording of Article IV. of the revised contract between Persian Railways Syndicate and the Persian Government, by which Persian Government s right to expropriate Sheikh is admitted. This pretension will not only wound susceptibilities of weaken our position should Foreign Power seek to obtain concessions from Persian Government within Sheikh’s territories. It will also impair validity Sheikh and be contested by him on adopted wnerei It seems to us be the means c means of obviating many potential difficulties m the lutuie.Enclosure 3 in No. 1.

I AM obliged for your letter of the 3rd July advising that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reports that the present moment is rather a hopeless one for reopening our negotiations for the mining concession, and suggesting that the matter should be deferred until the political situation is somewhat clearer, possibly in the autumn. From the tenour of Sir Walter Townley’s reply, it is presumable that he is unaware of the fact that the Persian Railway Syndicate was the outcome of our application for the mining concession, and of a direct request from the Persian Government that we should, as a consideration of the grant of the mining concession, provide 500,COOL of the capital that would be required for the construction of a railway from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. In all our negotiations with the Persian Government nnd with Mr. Shuster the one has always been made dependent on the other, and, in view of the fact that the Persian Government have now invited us to renew our negotiations in connection with railways, I shall be obliged if you will advise Sir Walter Townley of the above circumstances, and request him to kindly maintain the former position. I enclose copy of a telegram which I have received from Mr. A. 0.

Toumley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July L.) (No. 128.) Sir, Tehran, June 19, 1912. WITH reference to your despatch No. 105 of the 5th instant upon the subject of the proposed railway from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with a possible extension to Hamadan, I have the honour to state that the newly reconstituted Cabinet now in office has been too recently formed for it to have been possible to ascertain their views upon the question of railway construction in Persia. It is true that the Regent and the late Minister for Foreign Affairs had shown themselves favourably disposed to the idea of a line joining the two above-mentioned places, and that the Russian Minister has expressed his personal opinion that there would be small objection to a prolongation of the projected railway to Hamadan, since such a continuation might provide a useful feeder for the contemplated Tehran- Khanikin line. M. Poklewsky, however, when speaking to me on the subject, said that this was only his personal opinion, and that he was quite aware that such a scheme might meet with strong opposition from Russian trade interests. In the course of a conversation with Vossouk-ed-Dowleh, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 23rd ultimo, M. Poklewsky strongly supported my representa tions in favour of the projected railway to Khoremabad, and at the same time said that he was instructed to apply to the Persian Government for a concession for a railway from Julfa to Tabreez, with an extension to Lake Urmia. The capital, which was French, was ready for the construction of this line, which would be built, were the concession granted, under Russian auspices. Vossouk-ed-Dowleh adopted a most friendly attitude towards our proposals, and promised to submit them to the Regent andjthe Cabinet. Unfortunately, a prolonged Cabinet crisis occurred almost immediately, which has been the cause of much delay in the discussion of railway and other matters of pressing importance. From a conversation with the agent of the Persian Railway Syndicate yesterday, I have gathered that the attitude of the Minister of Finance, with whom he had discussed the question, is friendly, but that his Excellency is of opinion that such a scheme would require the sanction of a Medjhss, and that its best chance of success would be if it could be represented as a line being constructed by the company for the Persian Government. My Russian colleague is not at all favourable to the idea of a Medjiiss, and is afraid that the present administration will wreck all our schemes intended to further the development of the country if they are going to take refuge behind a National Assgih I )1 y I will report further as soon as I have had an occasion to ascertain the views of the Ala-es-8ultaneh, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of some of his colleagues as to the prospects of railway construction. ^ 1 iiave, &amp;c.

Wood telegraphs to Greenway that Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of 1 inance are u nwilling to c onsider rai lwa ys, and Green way points out that the railway syndicate was the outcome of his application for mining concession, and of direct request from Persian Government that as a consideration of the grant of the mining concession they should provide 500,000£. of capital required for construction of a railway from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. The one question has always been dependent on the other. In the light of the above facts, do you remain of the opinion that nothing can be done at present ? &lt;V&gt;Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received July 18, 6‘30 p.m.) (No. 414.) YOUR telegram No. 4(19 Tehran, July 18, 1912, 3*30 p.m. My Russian colleague is oi opinion that it would be well to push question of the Mohaminerah-Khoremahacl line now. Such action would possibly assist him in his endeavour to get labreez-Julfa—Urmia Railway concession through. Persian Government are quite prepared to consider question in a friendly spirit, but I that I am sceptical about any very definite promise being secured unless some L?^effective pressure can be applied. Present administration is very timid of committing itself in view of uncertain future. I would venture to call your attention to the fact that the proposed Kerman— Bunder Abbass ection and article?6 of the syndicate’s draft convention would secure to them preferential rights which might clash with the objects of the proposed transa#to*=ef Persian railway^ should His Majesty’s Government eventually decide to support that scheme, which from financial reasons may well prove impossible of realisation. Addition of the mining concession as a condition of the syndicate’s modified construction of railway system will not facilitate negotiations. i V 7CONFIDENTIAL. Z Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

YOUR letter of the 29th, enclosing a draft of a letter to the Foreign Office, only reached me on Monday night upon my return from a short visit to the continent. I had not time to answer it before your second letter arrived, advising me that the draft had been despatched. There is a passage in the letter wdiich I should have wished to see altered, namely, the passage in the concluding paragraph of p. 1 : “A line from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, Burujird or Hamadan would unquestionably, by reason of its much shorter lead to the coast, draw a great portion of the traffic from the proposed Bagdad-Khanikin line, and also much of the traffic which now goes north to the Caspian.” The passage conveys to me the impression that the line would affect unfavourably both Russian and German commercial interests in Persia. Both Russia and Germany are interested in the Bagdad-Khanikin line, and Russia is, of course, interested in keeping up the traffic with the Caspian. As regards the traffic with the Caspian, when the Russians build their part of the railway they will get all their share of this traffic, and the Bagdad-Khanikin-Tehran Railway will only be so far affected that the produce of regions already in communication with the head of the Gulf will not be drawn off to that railway. Our railway will, therefore, not tread upon | anybody’s toes. It is a railway at right angles with the Bagdad-Tehran Railway, and it develops the trade of Persia in its two natural directions—towards the north and towards the south. I should like to add that the route we adopted, namely, that up the Karun valley, via Dizful and Khoremabad, is the route which has received the vast preponderance of approval by experts, including, I think, experts wffio have reported to the Board of Trade or to the Foreign Office, as the best one for a railway to follow from the head of the Persian Gulf to the Persian tableland. It has been considered in discussion after discussion for many years past. That is, I understand, why this route was adopted with the full approva] of the Foreign Office. fi. F. B.

We have sulrnitLea it to our Board onci are desired by them to thank you for it and to submit in re&gt;;ly the following. In view of the great importance to British and British Indian Curamercial, and also to British political, interests, of the Hallways in which the Syndicate have been asked to interest themselves the Board are somewhat surprised and disappointed to see the apparent lukewarm attitude of the Indian Government and of the board of Trade towards these projects, especially The Under towards the proposed ohanmerah - Khoramabad Line* The suggestion that the terminus of this Hallway should be made at Dizful ia, in their opinion, extremely unsound, inasmuch as such a Hallway could not possibly pay as it would have to compete with cheap water transport by the Karun, which is more than ample to t loeal rtd Irtaiints* The main inducement from a commercial Secretary of State, Foreign Office.* &lt;tmfm a'-.cwp (uo ' r .

Although definite information or statistics of the amount of imports or exports are as wanting to-day as in 1904, when the Board of Trade Report was written, yet it is known that there has in recent years been a large increase in the caravan traffic passing through Central Persia, and if the terminus of the proposed line were placed at Khoramabad only (although preferably it should of course be carried on to Burujird or Ramadan) it is the opinion of those who know the country, and who have important interests in it, that the exports and imports already large, would very rapidly increase and make the Rail /ay a commercially paying, concern, if not from its opening yet within a very short period thereafter. There is practically no doubt that of all the proposed Railways running from the south of Persia Northwards this Railway is by far the most attractive and the most likely to prove a commercial success, even if only carried to Khoramabad, but that if carried further North to Ramadan itsits success would in the opinion of the Board be undoubted. In view of the strong opinions which they hold on this point the Directors therefore regret that they cannot for a moment entertain the idea of interesting themselves in a Railway which would have its terminus only at Dizful, and beg to request that the negotiations shall proceed on the lines originally contemplated, i.e. for a Railway which is to have its terminus at Khoramabad or preferably (if the political difficulties in the way of this can be surmounted) Burujird or Hamadan, and also for the other three lihes included in their proposals. In connection with the question of the alignment of the Mohammerah Railway, their Agent at Teheran advises them that the Regent and the Foreign Minister have expressed a strong desire that an application for its construction should be made up to Hamadanj and that Mr. Poklewski, whom their Agent saw recently on the matter expressed the opinion that his Government would make no objection to the line being built by a British Company up to this point, but would rather be disposed to view such an extension favourably, inasmuch as the Railway wouldwould then be a useful feeder to the proposed Teheran Khanikln Line. ihe Directors are also advised by their Agent that the Persian Government consider that the time is now favourable for a resumption of negotiations, and they would be obliged by the Foreign Office instructing His Majesty’s minister at Teheran to support their Agent in these negotiations, and also to enter into communication with the 'Russian Minister as to the prolongation of the Line to Burujird or if possible to Ramadan. They suggest that His Majesty’s Minister might furnish Monsieur Podlewski with a copy of the proposed Agreement with the Persian Government so that he and his Government may be more fully acquainted with the nature of our proposals and their support and co operation be assured.

Si r &gt; Foreign Office, April 19, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to address to you the following remarks for the confidential information of the Persian Railways Syndicate : Doubts having been expressed by experts as to whether the projected railway from Mohammerah to Khoremabad would prove a commercial success, in the absence of any considerable local traffic or export trade by that route, the Government of India were requested to examine the question with their commercial and railway experts in the light of a survey of the country recently made by Lieutenant Wilson, LA. The Government of India, in reply, stated that no definite opinion could be given as to the commercial probabilities of the line owing to the insufficiency and vagueness of the available data, but they added that they concurred in the view that the commercial success of the line and its ability to rival the route from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf are doubtful, while considering nevertheless that, provided a substantial portion of the Kermanshah traffic can be secured, the construction of the Mohammerah-Dizful section holds out a fairer prospect of proving remunerative, since, amongst other reasons, the construction of this section would apparently be easy and cheap. The question was then referred to the Board of Trade. The Board intimated that they had no sufficient information to enable them to form any estimate as to the probable cost of construction of a line from Mohammerah to Dizful, but they saw no reason to doubt the correctness of the opinion expressed by the Government of India that its construction would be relatively easy and cheap. Such a line, they added, would presumably follow approximately the route of the Karun River, upon which there is a considerable volume of traffic both to Ahwaz and to Shuster by the steamers of Messrs. Lynch and the Nasiri Company, a traffic which has recently increased owing to the insecurity of the Bushire-Ispahan route. The Board of Trade further state that although the route is of importance and the construction of a railway would be likely to facilitate trade with Ispahan via Ahwaz, and with Khoremabad and Sultanabad via Dizfnl (and in the latter case the present necessityfor transhipment at Ahwaz would be obviated), yet the absence of any substantial amount of local traffic would militate against the commercial success of the undertaking. According to a report furnished to the Board of Trade in 1904, the regions of Dizful, Shuster, the Bakhtiari country, and the lower plains of the Karun, in which trade should naturally converge on the Karun, had a population of only about 300,000; the chief products were grain and wool, but the exports were quite small; the Arab tribes were not industrious by nature, and though the country was fertile and capable of great improvement by means of irrigation and there were some possibilities of trade development, the economic progress of the region could not be expected to be otherwise than very slow. For these reasons, the Board of Trade are disposed to doubt the likelihood of the undertaking being commercially successful, though they recognise that the suggested Mohammerah -Dizful line would probably be less unre- munerative than a longer line. An extract from the report furnished to the Board of Trade in 1904 is enclosed, also for the confidential information of your syndicate.* I am, in conclusion, to express Sir E. Grey’s opinion that, when applying for the concession, it would be well to apply for a concession for a line as far as Khoremabad, and not merely up to Dizful, though possibly construction on the Dizful-Khoremabad section would be deferred. * See [12866].

Dear Mr. Mallet, Mr. Greenway to Mr. Mallet.—(Received March 19.) Winchester Rouse, Old Broad Street, London, March 18, 1912. WITH reference to my conversation with you a short time ago, I enclose copies of telegrams exchanged with our agent at Tehran. Apparently, the first step to be taken is to secure the co-operation of the Russian Government, and if you think any further action can advantageously be taken at the present time by our syndicate, I shall be glad to see you and discuss the matter at your convenience. Lord Errington asked to see me a few days ago with a view to securing co operation between our syndicate and the Trans-Persian Societe d’Etude. I explained that we shall at all times be pleased to co-operate with them on the basis that the railways of more pressing importance from the points of view of both British and Russian interests were given prior consideration, and he seemed to recognise that this was essential, at any rate so far as regards the proposed Mohammerah and (or Khor Musa) Khorremabad line. In fact, he appeared to be under the impression that the concession for this line had already been obtained by our syndicate, and expressed surprise that we had not already begun construction ! (Translation.) REFERRING to your telegram of the 6th, British Minister, Tehran, informed me he had received on the 6th March message from the Regent, requesting that Persian Government should not be asked for any concession for a considerable time. Apparently, message outcome terms and conditions 200,000 advance; British Minister, Tehran, thinks it advisable to delay about two months. I had interview with the Regent the 9th March ; he repeated several times that he had very great hope for the future ; he looked forward to the opening up of the country by railways, most important line being Khormusa-Mohammerah north; that it was essential this line to be of value should be extended to Hamadan by agreement between England-Russia. He looked forward to great benefit from the Trans-Persian Railway ; he said Russia in a few years would have to construct Tehran-Khanikin line, and beforehand they will have to construct other railways in the north; he considered present time favourable for opening negotiations, but he said there are two difficulties in the way—first, the Cabinet may not be willing to grant concession so soon after the Medjliss dissolved, he will ascertain attitude Cabinet if I approach Foreign Minister ; second, there will be great difficulties in the way to railway concession until Great Britain and Russia come to some definite agreement as to what railways are to be constructed in Persia ; he could not understand why such agreement had not been come to already ; England and Russia, he said, have made a declaration that any concession granted without their consent will be regarded as unfriendly act.

I have, 6&amp;c., (Signed) Geo. J. Stanley.VERY CONFIDENTIAL. Report to the Board of Trade by Mr. H. W. Maclean, Special Commissioner of the Commercial Intelligence Committee to Persia, on certain matters connected with Persian Trade. Russian trade, pressed forward by the Russian Government for political purposes, has encroached on Persian markets hitherto supplied by the British Empire. Commercial interests are less important than political interests in Persia, therefore British commerce will conrinue to recede under pressure of Russian political needs unless the British Government finds cause to intervene. Many ways of strengthening our commercial position in Persia have been proposed. I think our most pressing needs are—better roads, with greater security for wayfarers and merchandise, and an organised transport service ; a stronger Consular Office in Teheran; reform of Persian commercial law. Trade, industry, and enterprise in Persia struggle to expand under corrupt administration of vague and ill-defined laws. The people are exceedingly poor, and the market for most commodities very limited; the standard of commercial morality amongst Persians is low, and is certainly not improving; the means of communication within the country are primitive, and many districts are unsafe for traveller or merchandise. In fact Persia does not offer convenient scope for great trading enterprises, and foreign traders settling in it have seldom secured brilliant profits. It must not be imagined, therefore, that the trade of the British Empire with Persia is so robust as to be able to defy all attacks upon it. So far, it has been seriously assailed from only one quarter—the Russian Empire, which has secured to its commerce advantages in Persia not enjoyed by other commerce. The Russian Government has secured to its subjects a certain immunity from foreign competition in Khorassan and the Caspian provinces of Persia by refusing transit to foreign imports over the Batoum-Tiflis route. It has promoted, and to a great extent financed, the construction of a carriage road from Enzeli to Teheran, and has made preparation to construct similar roads from Julfa through Tabriz to Kazvin, and from Kazvin to Hamadan. It has subventioned a line of merchant steamers between the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf. It holds, for some years to come, a veto on railway construction or anything of the nature of a rail or tramway (except urban) in Persia, and has obtained from the' Persian Government an undertaking not to impose taxes, or tolls, on roads (except carriage roads) which may be constructed in future, thus practically denuding that Government of power to encourage improvement of trade routes in the mountainous regions of Southern Persia, where carriage roads are hardly practicable. It allows drawback of duty on a number of commodities suited to the Persian market, and as regards sugar and certain printed and dyed cotton tissues these drawbacks appear to involve distinct bounty. Import to Russia of certain Persian products, such as raw cotton, rice, and fruits, is encouraged by partial exemption from the protective duties levied in Russia on the same products from other countries. It has established and controls a Bank in Teheran, with branches at Meshed, Resht, and Tabriz ; and this Bank has been utilised to push Russian trade with Persia, by means of large advances to traders dealing in Russian commodities, and such favourable terms and prices as seem incompatible with business profits and suggest a form of bounty on trade, through the Bank, with Russia. It has secured, under the recent Customs Convention of 1902, favourable rates of duty in Persia on the commodities of greatest interest to Russian commerce. It has increased the number of its consulates and consular staff in Persia. I think trade routes are, on the whole, safer for merchandise and w r ayfarer. 33611. 50.—10/04. Pk. 103. E. &amp; S.and the remoter districts more accessible for sojourn and residence of foreign subjects in Northern than in Southern Persia, and that this is attributable, m Dart to continued diplomatic pressure and consular energy, P i do not think that these measures taken by the Russian Government have all been equally successful in giving a permanent advantage to Russian commerce in Persia, but on the whole they have sufficed to drive many British commodities out of those markets of Northern Persia lying under the ?n7dow of the great Elburz, range, and have enabled Russian commodities to compete with ours in Hamadan, Ispahan, and Yezd, commercial centres equaTy accessible from the Caspian and the Persian Gulf. Our commerce has not yet been seriously crippled, but if the Russian Government continue unopposed, this energetic commercial policy m Persia our traders wil gradually be beaten oSt of the central markets also, and Russian commercial SUP o“ a 7o™ e unaid P ef c^n hardly oppose a combined front to this organised Russian aggression, for the traders engaged m that commerce, and the home manufacturers with whom they deal, are all competing with each other, as well as with the foreign rival, and few of them have a vital interest in Persian trade. Indeed, it appears to me that the determination evmc by the Russian State to aid Russian commerce with _ Persia has produced a distinct moral effect on foreign enterprises, m that it has been equally an incentive to enterprise on the part of the private Russian trader and a deterrent to enterprise (especially where large outlay of capital is involved) on the part of British traders; for the former feel tneir Government to be behind them, and the latter have to apprehend, not only the competition ot Russian traders, whose manufacturing and trading resources they can gauge, but also the interposition of the Russian Government to counteract, for political purposes, any success attending their efforts to extend trade detrimental to Russian influence in Persia. Commercial influence is a useful political weapon, and the extension, or decline, of trade with Persia has a deeper interest to the Russian and the British Empires than the simple gam or loss of profitable markets. The Russian Government^ has intervened m Russian trade with Persia to confer benefits, which the conflicting and limited interest of private traders could not combine to achieve. British commercial enterprise, in certain respects, awaits the indication, and must follow the lead, of the British Government, which is alone able to oppose the Russian Government in efforts directed, through commerce, towards political ends. _ . Our contribution to trade interests in Persia at present consists m some small aid to trade routes in the Karun and Seistan regions, and that part of our consular service which might be expected to disappear along with our trade. A simple commercial trader seldom hesitates to venture one year’s income of a sound business to safeguard future dividends. I make little doubt that the amount of imperial and local taxation for one year, m the British Empire, on the capital and labour representing an annual trade of three millions, must exceed the capitalised value of the contribution above mentioned. The most pressing cry of our traders is for quicker and cheaper transport of commodities between the frontier and inland markets in Persia than at present exists. I think it essential to consider only routes based on the Persian Gulf and India, for onr trade through Trebizoud is not now of first importance. The markets open to that route have been gradually limited to Tabriz and the southern parts of Azerbaijan, not from Russian competition only, but also from our own competition by the superior Gulf routes. Moreover, trade by the Trebizond route is largely conducted through Constantinople, as an intermediate market, and the Persian traders dealing there are brought more in contact with rival commodities of other nations than those dealing in Bagdad, Bombay, and Manchester by the southern routes. Merchandise consigned to Trebizond is carried by continental steamers, while nearly all merchandise (except Russian) consigned to the Persian Gulf pays freight to British shipping.A 2 3 We still deliver our merchandise more cheaply at the Persian frontier than Russia does. Cotton goods, which form to us the most important subject of competition m Persian trade, pay freight from Manchester to any port in the Persian Gulf of about 2|Z. per ton weight, and from Moscow to Persian Caspian ports of about per ton weight. (The average value of ^ cotton goods consigned to the Persian Gulf is roughly 100/. per ton weight) ! As regards inland transport to certain important commercial centres the position is reversed. Transport on our bale goods from Bushire to Ispahan is about lOfZ. per ton, to Teheran about 17|Z. per ton, from Busreh via Bagdad, to Hamadan about 13/. per ton, and from Bunder Abbas to Meshed over 25^/. per ton. Transport on Russian goods from Enzeli to Ispahan is about Ilf/, per ton, to Teheran about 7±L per ton, to Hamadan about 8fZ V per ton, and from Ashkabad to Meshed about 71. per ton. It has been suggested that railway construction is the remedy we need Statistics available to estimate the quantity of freight and passenger traffic, with which railways in Southern Persian might hope to deal,' are scant. Persian customs returns show that foreign commerce with Persia by Persian Gulf routes (including Kermanshah) is somewhat less than 31 million pounds sterling annually, of a gross weight of perhaps 60,000 to 70,0*10 tons; of which 2J millions are imports (the moiety cotton textiles). The total imports and exports for the year to 20th March 1902 at Bushire and Bunder s Abbas are given as 1,640,000/., weighing 35,000 tons; at Kermanshah as 1,040,000/., weighing less than 16,000 tons. Consular returns for the Karun river for 1901 show a trade of 127,000/., weighing 4,000 tons. I can make little more than a guess at the distribution of this trade. Perhaps commodities of half a million in value, weighing, say, ten to twelve thousand tons, are produced or consumed on the Gulf littoral, and therefore would not be subject for railway freight; possibly a million in value, weighing, say, fifteen to twenty thousand tons, are produced or consumed in such centres as Kerman, Shiraz, and Kermanshah, involving land transport ^ of some 200 to 300 miles; and the remaining two millions in value, weighing thirty to forty thousand tons, have to be transported 400 to 600 miles to or from Ispahan, Hamadan, and Yezd, the chief markets from which our commerce deals with Central and Northern Persia. I cannot furnish statistics with regard to the existing traffic derived from internal trade. Persia is a mountainous country without navigable rivers (except one corner traversed, by the lower Karun), and has never possessed good roads; consequently the growth of industrial centres has been restricted to the needs of limited areas, for neither raw material nor food can bear the cost of transport over great distances. Therefore I should guard against too high an estimate of the probable home traffic between distant centres in Persia, such as would provide matter for railway freight. Again, in estimating the volume of new freight which would be created by railway facilities, it must be remembered that Persia supplies chiefly raw animal and vegetable products, and her capacity to increase these supplies does not depend, altogether, on the area of fertile land available. That, in great measure, is governed by the amount of rain and irrigation water. The supply ana efficiency of irrigation water can doubtless be increased, but not to an indefinite extent, for a fairly skilful and elaborate system of irrigation already exists. In a great part of the vast grazing regions, the herbage— dependent, in the plains, on scant winter rains—is burnt up by the sun during summer; and, in the mountains, is available only after the snows which give it life are melted by the summer sun. Proprietors in some of the grazing regions informed me that, in their opinion, their lands could not carry a much greater stock than at present. I have also failed to obtain statistics regarding passenger traffic. The most frequented route in Southern Persia is probably that through Kermanshah to Bagdad, over which 150,OCX) pilgrims are said to pass annually to visit Kerbela. There is arto a constant flow of pilgrims to Meshed, and to Kom from all parts of Persia; and to Persian Gulf ports from all parts of Persia, and Transcaspia, for passage to Mecca. All the important commercial centres of Persia cannot be connected with each other and the Gulf by any one railway. A line from Bushire to Teheran4 would not greatly benefit the districts of Kerman, Yezd, Kermanshah, or Hamadan, and would pass through a tangled mass of mountains before gaining Shiraz. The Karun forms a sufficient highway for development of the Arabistan plains, but affords a restricted waterway in summer for a railway base at Ahwaz; and Muhammerah is in a lesser degree open to the objection of being only a river port within the difficult Euphrates bar. A railway in this region would hardly attempt to pierce the Bakhtiari mountains, but would attain Sultanabad, Hamadan, and Teheran with comparative ease. In that case our markets in Shiraz, Ispahan, Kerman, and lezd would not benefit. Bunder Abbas has a poor water supply, the summer air is often tainted by a spume cast upon the sandy beach, and shallow waters forbid steamers to approach within two miles of the present pier. It possesses, however, a magnificent roadstead, and a glance at the chart of the Clarence Strait suggests that a suitable site for a port might be found twenty or thirty miles west of the present town. Comparative coolness and good water are found in the hills forty or fifty miles inland. A railway from Bunder Abbas through Kerman, Yezd, or Abadeh, and Ispahan, to Suitanabad, branching there to Teheran on the one side, and to Kermanshah and Bagdad on the other, would have a longer mileage from that port to some of these places than might be necessary from other ports, but would omit only the Ears district from its scope; and, eventually linked to other systems at Bagdad and Nushki, would become part of a great overland route to India. On the whole I do not apprehend that railway construction in Persia offers, at present, any certain promise of traffic receipts proportionate to the expenditure involved ; and it is more than questionable whether Persia, which would undoubtedly derive most benefit from such exploits, has the means to offer adequate guarantees to foreign capital. Moreover, I do not foresee that railway construction in Southern Persia would necessarily favour us in commercial competition with Russia, unless we are assured that Russia would not reply by railway construction in the north, for if they did, then Russian goods, already competing inland with ours, would also be delivered just as much cheaper and quicker than hitherto. I believe, unless Russia takes the initiative in the north, it suffices for us to secure that we shall have freedom to deal with such projects in Southern Persia when more obvious need for them arises. (It is not probable that the Bagdad railway, if, or when, completed, will affect the course of trade with Persia. British and Continental goods now arrive at Bagdad, by sea and river, at something less than 5/. per ton weight, and it seems improbable that the railway can compete on these terms. A small quantity of British cotton goods find their way into Azerbaijan through Mosul and Sonjbulak, but no saving in freight the railway might offer would enable that route to compete in Central Persia.) The construction of roads for wheel traffic in Persia has not hitherto conferred great benefit either on the companies constructing, or on the communities using them. The Russian road from Enzeli to Teheran has been built at enormous cost; it is reported the heavy tolls levied on it do not suffice for any margin of profit, and cerfainly the cost of transport over it is not less than over the previous mule track. The Ahwaz-Teheran road, conceived in the interests of British commerce, has been even less successful, and the only part which has been completed is that between Teheran and Sultanabad, thus permitting of continuous wheel traffic from Enzeli to Kom and Sultanabad. Consequently, if any benefit has been conferred by it on commerce, it has been conferred on Russian, not on British, trade. Any road in Persia, useful to foreign commerce, must negotiate steep gradients, its surface must be sodden by snow in winter, and disintegrated by drought in summer, and results, so far, have not shown that such roads can be main tained in a state to render waggon traffic more economical than pack transport. Communications between Central Persia and the southern seaboard, by existing caravan tracks, leave much to be desired ; and I think the Bushire- Shiraz and Bunder-Abbas-Kerman routes deserve attention equally with the Shuster Burujird route.A 3 5 The Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan route is a highway to important regions which cannot be served by Karun routes. Nearly a million pounds value of merchandise, chiefly British, is yearly shot on to the open beach at the caravan terminus of Shief, which boasts neither shelter nor water. The horrors of the Bushire-Shiraz track have been skilfully pictured by' many writers. It is, I imagine, the worst under heaven of any trunk route carrying an equally important traffic, but the difficulties of it, as a caravan route, are due as much to long use as to nature. From wear of constant traffic the road bed has become in parts a mass of pebbles, rolling stones, and boulders, and has been worn at confined places into deep trenches, through which animals loaded with bulky packages can hardly pass singly,’ and are completely blocked if traffic in the other direction is encountered. The surface is so bad that camel caravans, the most economical form of transport, do not frequent it. The gradients are undoubtedly severe, but that is not nearly so bad for pack transport as for waggon traffic. There are few places, perhaps not half a mile in all, where the road overhangs dangerous precipices. From Shief to Shiraz may be 150 miles, and of that distance, I calculate, 120 miles are flat or undulating ground, of which only one-third, clay or stony soil, needs attention. The remaining 30 miles are steep passes and ravines, one- third rock and two-thirds loose stones and boulders, and require heavy repairs. From Shiraz to Ispahan the existing caravan track offers no serious obstacle to any form of pack transport, and probably before long it will be so far improved, under the aegis of the Persian Administration of Posts, as to permit of a fourgon service for passengers. It is not desirable in the interests of our trade that all improvements in communications should creep downward from the north, whilst access from the south becomes more difficult year by year, and it can hardly be impossible to improve the ^ Bushire-Shiraz route, at reasonable cost, so far as to give pack animals ifair foothold, and to provide inward and outward tracks at confined places. But this is not an enterprise for private capital, since no direct return, such as tolls or road taxes, can be obtained from it. The Bunder-Abbas-Kerman route is reported to be feasible for all forms of pack transport, and needs little, if any, repair. It carries our commerce with Kerman, Yezd, and parts of Khorassan which cannot be tapped by any other route. But the policing of these routes is at present extremely unsatisfactory. Theft and robbery of merchandise is frequent, even European travellers are occasionally held up, and native travellers pass in dread of black-mail, robbery, and open violence by the Persian road guards or robbers in collusion with them. The Persian Government appears unwilling or powerless to correct these abuses, and we should either undertake to officer and discipline these guards ourselves, or maintain an independent road guard to protect our travellers and commerce. I advocate, therefore, the formation of a company or companies to be subsidised by the British and Indian Governments to the extent of the expenditure necessary to make these routes into fair caravan tracks, and of the cost of private policing of them under Government guidance, and to establish on purely commercial lines a landing, clearing, forwarding, ware housing, and delivery business in the chief commercial centres of Persia. I think a well-organised business of this kind has every prospect of success. In northern Persia several Russian transport agencies have been established, and are reported to be securing business. I calculate that at Bushire alone quite 4,000?. to 5,000?. per annum are now spent in landing, shipping, clearing, and delivering merchandise in a most perfunctory manner, which could be more cheaply and efficiently effected by an organised company possessing a few barges and a tug. Merchandise for transport inland is now confided to individual muleteers, whose responsibility in respect of these goods is of the vaguest description. They are usually persons of small means, and purchase their fodder and provisions at exorbitant prices from caravanserai lessees, who themselves pay high rents and cannot lay in large supplies on the most favourable terms. Merchandise landed in Bushire is seldom delivered at Ispahan within two months, or at a less cost than I?. 16s.. per mule load. A loaded mule can easily travel that distance, about 470*6 miles, in one month (with a system of relays, goods could easily be delivered in a fortnight), and the cost of its forage, attendance, and allowance for depreciation need not amount to 11. per month. Commerce in general, and particularly traders with limited capital, would derive great benefit from a quicker despatch of merchandise, forwarded at more uniform rate of transport, and represented by a way bill available as a transferable security for banking or other advances. A company com mencing simply as an organiser and contractor of transport would be able to offer all these advantages, and could gradually extend its operations, through control, to ownership of caravans, stations, and forage, in order to secure the fullest economy and expedition in transport. I have pointed out that the concession from the Persian Government for such a purpose could not confer rights of levying tolls or taxes. It should, at least, convey to us an option (like that now held by Ptussia in regard to railways), over any projects in the Gulf which may appear probable subjects of subsequent enterprise, such as dock or harbour works, tramways, or the irrigation of the Karun plains. This latter project is already a matter to which the attention of British enterprise might well be directed, by collating and arranging all information extant on the subject. An effort is now being made to re-open and improve the Karun route through Shuster and Burujird to Sultanabad, and I hope it will be prose cuted with vigour and determination, for this route promises much benefit to our commerce. A fair caravan track can be constructed at moderate expense, transport on it will be cheap, as part of the region traversed is a mule-breeding district, and forage and grain are abundant. Our imports should be delivered in Sultanabad, Hamadan, and Kermanshah on better terms than by the Bagdad route, and, what is most desirable, an export trade will be encouraged in carpets, opium, skins, leather, gums, wool, and other products of these regions, some of which are at present exported only by northern routes. The waggon route from Sultanabad will be brought in touch with the Persian Gulf, and will facilitate transport of our imports to Teheran. I have stated elsewhere the grounds for my opinion that the Nushki- Seistan route will not serve to retrieve our commercial position in Khorassan. But if it is desired to foster trade by that route, I think the Indian Govern ment would best serve that end by establishing a transport service to undertake the carriage of merchandise, at stated intervals, and at a uniform rate of freight, based on the approximate cost of maintenance and attendance of a caravan for the time occupied on the journey from Nushki to Meshed. The uncertainty in obtaining transport, and the heavy cost resulting from freight being all in one direction, is severely felt by Meshed importers. The establishment would not be very costly, and the loss on animals earning no freight would disappear if a well-balanced import and export trade can be established. But Meshed, the commercial centre of all Khorassan, lies too near the Transcaspian railway to permit of competition with Russia on equal terms, and I think more fruitful results might perhaps be obtained by studying the means to secure a market in India for export products such as carpets, shawls, wool, mohair, ghi, dried fruits, and nuts, at present sent to Meshed from Turbat, Birjand, Herat, and neighbouring parts of Afghanistan, but which could with equal facility be sent to such a centre as Birjand, if buyers could be found there for them. These products would then be exchanged for British goods in Birjand, instead of for Russian goods in Meshed. The Russian consular service in Persia is generally believed by Persians to have shown greater energy and determination in supporting mercantile claims than other consular services have shown. In consequence of this reputation Russian traders may have been encouraged to deal more freely with Persians than other traders have, as debtors are perhaps more careful to avoid entanglement with Russian than with other creditors, but I have not myself found clear ground for this assertion. Nor have I discovered, on enquiry into such instances as came to my notice, that the ultimate results obtained by Russian methods have been markedly satisfactory. There is no code of mercantile law which can be appealed to, and the Consul can7 1 i exercise only official and personal influence to secure settlement of claims for unseasonable pressure only results in a reference by the local Persian official to the Central Government, with certainty of further delay and complication. Nearly all disputes of any importance are therefore ultimately referred to the capital, and settlement there, in the present corrupt state of administration, must often await diplomatic opportunity. We need a stronger Consular Office in Teheran, well versed in commercial affairs, to keep record of, arrange, and constantly push forward the cases sent in by the provincial consulates, up to the point where diplomatic intervention may become necessary. That consulate might also record much useful informa tion on many subjects—Persian commercial law and procedure, especially precedents already established in commercial cases, trade usages, routes, products and manufactures—collected and tabulated from the reports of the provincial consulates. It is perhaps hopeless to expect any early reform in the present corrupt administration of justice in Persia. But if our diplomacy can induce the Persian Government to make a code of commercial law, and institute a registration of real property, our merchants and consuls would at least secure a base from which to battle against unjust decisions and a check on fraudulent transfers of houses and lands, so often resorted to by debtors to render awards abortive.

His Excellency replied that we must certainly not lose so good an opportunity for obtaining the concession. On my observing that British interests were more concerned with Mohammerah line, and that pressure might therefore be brought to bear on His Majesty’s Govern ment to obtain concession for it, his Excellency repeated all the objections which the Russian Government have to that railway whilst I recapitulated all our former arguments in support of it. His Excellency said that Minister of Finance would be sure to oppose it, but finally seemed to take more favourable view that it might stop construction of Gulf section [sic] and perhaps replace Khanikin line. After the aide-memoire enclosed in my despatch No. 78*of last year, I do not see how the Russian Government can object to our asking for concession if our present purpose is only to earmark the railway. We should, however, inform them of our intention beforehand. If, on the other hand, we propose to proceed with construction we must, m accordance with assurances we gave in March of last year, discuss the whole question with them so as to see how Russian interests can best be safeguarded. If construction is contemplated at an early date, it might be well for the syndicate to send a representative, but I had perhaps better first be instructed to approach Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs officially on the subject. There is certain to be strong opposition to the line in commercial circles, and I am not in a position to judere whether the view taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to its possible effect on the Bagdad lines can be pressed. £8MMP912 ;?

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 9, 1-20 p.m.) (No- 175.) Tehran, March 9, 1912, 2T0 YOUR telegram No. 17z of 7th March. The Regent sent me a message on 6th March to the effect that it would embarrass the Persian Government if, immediately after the recognition of the Anglo-Russian convention, the two Powers were to come forward with demands for concessions. Regent evidently had in mind railway concession, for he said particularly that his remark did not apply to such an unimportant concession as that of the Russian motor cars, but he also said that if, in the case of Mohammerah line, international considerations compelled an immediate application the matter would be different, and he gave me to understand that, in these circumstances, an application would be considered. In view of Regent’s message I should be inclined to advise postponing of reopening negotiations for the present unless you consider that political considerations render delay unadvisable. There is another consideration which must not be lost sight of, viz,, that to attempt to push through a concession of the kind might be construed as a recognition of extinction of the Medjliss (this is, however, perhaps of no great importance, seeing that impending loan negotiations while Medjliss is in abeyance will bear the same construction). On the other hand, I gather from conversation with Russian Minister that the question of trans-Persian railway is likely to be raised when loan proposals are made to Persian Government. I do not know how far it will be feasible to negotiate for the two railways concurrently, and it may be thought desirable to get on with the Mohammerah line negotiations before all securities are taken for the loan. As regards Mornard, I think that he can be depended on at any rate to judge Mohammerah railway scheme on its merits. • A \V ED ^ —---Av * al ds — [151—817]Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay (Tehran).

A line from Julfa to Mohammerah would have been useful as a counterpoise to Baghdad Railway, but it has quite lost its value now that trans-Persian Railway is to be counterpoise. We think, therefore, that Mohammerah-Hamadan concession should be obtained merely for the purpose of earmarking as against any attempt to connect Baghdad Railway extension with the Gulf by this route. At the same time it would probably be a good political move to send Wilson to survey Dizful-Burujird Section up to Russian sphere, and we agree with Cox that it is unnecessary to consult Persian Government first, and we would give Wilson soldier surveyor for whose services he asks. We strongly support lines between Bunder Abbas and Kerman and between Bunder Abbas and Mohammerah, via Shiraz, Behbehan, and Khor Musa ; but we deprecate line from Bushire via Kirgiz to join latter ; it woidd be very costly, quite unnecessary as a commercial project or as bar to German enterprise, since the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz Mohammerah line would attract all trade to Bunder Abbas and Bushire would entirely lose its importance as a port. We are prepared to discuss proposals to share with imperial exchequer any financial responsibility on account of railway guarantee.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’ s Qo^emmBid ] !

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letter of the 23rd December, forwarding copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople’ respecting a projected change in the trace of the Bagdad Railway between Mosul and Bagdad, and to offer the following observations thereon for Sir E. Grey’s consideration :— The proposed change involves the substitution of a trunk line from Mosul via Suleimanieh and Khanikin to Bagdad for a trunk line direct from Mosul to Bagdad, with a branch from Sadijeh to Khanikin. Whichever arrangement be adopted, the railway system north of Bagdad would be entirely under German control; and the Board are accordingly disposed to doubt whether, so far as purely commercial considerations are concerned, the acceptance by the Turkish Government of the proposed modification would seriously change the present situation from the point of view of British interests. Having regard to the nature of the country to be traversed, it appears not impossible (though on this point the Board are not in a position to express a definite opinion) that the alteration of trace would delay the date at which the railway w^ould reach Bagdad from the north. If, on the other hand, the Bagdad- Khanikin section were built before the remainder of the line, British trade from the south would naturally be benefited. In this connection I am to point out that His Majesty’s Ambassador appears to be under some misapprehension as to the views of this department with regard to the possibility of discrimination against British goods on the German lines. The Board \ have never imagined that it would be possible by means of any written agreements entirely to do away with all risk of such discrimination ; but they fail to see how such risk would be increased, so far as the Bagdad-Khanikin route is concerned, if that route were served by a main line instead of a branch line. With regard to the proposed Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, the Board have previously expressed the opinion that such a line, though doubtless of advantage to British trade, could not become financially self-supporting for a very considerable period ; and that a financial guarantee of some kind would therefore be essential. They have no information as to the present position in regard to the application of the Persian Railways Syndicate for a concession including the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, but in view of the existing condition of affairs in Persia they think it unlikely that British capital would be available except on condition of a definite guarantee from His Majesty’s Government, and such a guarantee would, in their opinion, require to be justified on other than purely commercial grounds. Unless, therefore, His Majesty’s Government is for political reasons prepared to guarantee the proposed line, the Board doubt the advisability of pressing the Persian Government for a concession which might prove difficult to carry out. In any case this proposed concession does not appear to have any obvious connection with the suggested change of trace of the Bagdad Railway. I am to suggest, however, that it might be desirable to endeavour to ascertain whether there are any British interests in the petroleum deposits understood to exist in the neighbourhood of Suleimanieh, with a view to taking such steps as may be desirable to safeguard them. I am to add that the Board earnestly trust that all possible means will be adopted to expedite the completion of the proposed arrangement with the Turkish Government for the construction of the Bagdad-Bussorah Railway by a new company, on which British interests will be adequately represented. 1 am, &amp;c.

To The Right Hon’blb the EARL op CREWE, K.G., His Majesty* s Secretary of State for India* Fort William, the 23 rd February 1911. Mr Lord, We have the honour to refer to Lord Morley’s Secret despatch No. 32, dated the 4th November 1910, and subsequent telegraphic correspond ence on the subject of the scheme proposed by the Russian Consortium for the connection of the European and Indian railway systems by the construction of a line from Baku to Nushki via Tehran, Kum, Kashan, Yezd and Kerman. 2. As will be seen from the enclosed, papers, the question of the attitude which India should assume towards the scheme has been fully discussed both departmentally and in consultation with our local advisers. In view of the diversity of opinion displayed in the preliminary discussion, we thought it advisable to appoint a representative inter-departmental Committee to examine and consider the question in all its bearings and to advise as to the terms of the reply to be sent to your predecessor’s despatch. The conclusions of this Committee, as will be seen from their report,* are • Enclosure No 6 that the Government of India will be Enclosure NO. 6. well advised to accept in principle the proposal of the Russian Consortium, subject to the following modifications and conditions : — (a) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi, and not at Nushki; (5) that the route from Yezd tS Karachi be via Bandar Abbas and thence along the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey; (c) that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan, Bam and Kerman ; (ii) from Mohammerah to Hamadan ; (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar Abbas via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; (d) that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory he international, Russia and Great Britain holding a preponder ating share and Persia being admitted to participate ;(e) that the of the line passing through British territory and the British zone be different from that of the line in the Bussian zone, and that the break of gauge he at Bandar Abbas on the limit of the British zone; (f) that, in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should pledge herself not to entertainer support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a in the neighbourhood of the Perso-Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones. 3. We concur generally in these conclusions, except in regard to a few points as to which we find ourselves unable to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. The first point relates to the proposed internationalisation of the branch lines. We agree that it will be desirable to internationalise anv branch lines that may be constructed in the neutral zone. But we see no necessity for treating as international any branch lines which Russia or Great Britain may decide to construct in their respective zones. We would propose, therefore, to treat the proposed branch line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Kerman as a purely British project and to keep this question out of the negotiations with Russia, except in so far as her support may be necessary to enable us to secure a concession from the Persian Government. 4. Secondly, we do not endorse the proposal for a branch line from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan. Such a line would be a most difficult and most costly undertaking, and would at the same time be quite unnecessary either as a commercial project or as a bar to German enterprise, since the construction of a line from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz and Mohammerah would cause all the trade to pass through Bandar Abbas and Mohammerah and Bushire would entirely lose its importance as a port. Bandar Abbas could, we believe, be converted into a good port, while Bushire can never be a good port, since all the big ships have to lie out at a distance of five or six miles from the shore. Consequently, Bushire must in the end disappear as a trade centre and a railway to Shiraz would be useless. Whether Shiraz should be connected with Ispahan or not is another matter. If the Trans-Persian line passes through Ispahan, as proposed by the Consortium, a branch to Shiraz would be advantageous from the Russian point of view, since it would provide railway communication with Shiraz which Russian trade w T ould not otherwise have. In that case, we think that it would be desirable to make no mention of a branch from Shiraz to Ispahan at present. If, on the other hand, the Trans-Persian line is to avoid Ispahan, as proposed by the Russian Government, it would be greatly to our advantage to have a connection with Ispahan, since our trade would be able to pour in from Bandar Abbas via Shiraz. We think, therefore, that it would be better to take no action in regard to this branch line until it is known more certainly wffiether the Trans-Persian line is to pass through Ispahan or not. 5. Thirdly, we disagree with the Committee as to the necessity for pro- ceedino* w ith the construction of the Mohammerah-Hamadan line simul taneously with the construction of the main line. Such a branch would be useless for practical purposes, since it would have to compete with the Baghdad-Khanikin line and the Trans-Persian Railway. Aline from Julfa to Mohammerah would have been useful as a counterpoise to the Baghdad Railway in the absence of the more comprehensive scheme now proposed, but it has quite lost its value now that the Trans-Persian Railway is to be the counterpoise. We think, therefore, that the Mohammerah-Hamadan concession should be obtained merely for the purpose of ear-marking, as against any attempt to connect the Baghdad Railway extension with the Gulf by this route. 6. Pinally, we are not persuaded, on the information contained in the Committee’s report, that the practical difficulties of the alignment proposed by Colonel Cox (namely, from Yezd to Karachi via Kerman, Bam, Regan, Bampur, Sarbaz and Kej) are so serious as to make it necessary to adopt the more circuitous route via Bandar Abbas, and we have some doubt whether the latter route would prove acceptable to the Russian Government. We would prefer4 3 therefore to reserve our opinion as to the respective merits of the Yezd- Bandar Abbas-Karachi and Yezd-Kerman-Karachi alignments until these two routes have been examined locally by a railway engineer. 7 . With these reservations, we commend the Committee’s proposals to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government and have only to add that, in our opinion, it is very desirable, if the Trans-Persian Railway is to be made at all, that it should be commenced as soon as possible, so that it may be completed some time before the Baghdad Railway. The line will then have acquired a certain amount of trade and traffic that would naturally fall to the line that is first completed. 8. We have made no suggestions as to the financing of the proposed line, as this is a matter which His Majesty’s Government will probably wish to reserve for discussion in England. But we endorse the recommendation of the Committee that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain in connection with the project should be shared equally between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers.

E. H. S, CLARKE, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.24. Enclosure No. 6. Report of the Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. The propos il of the Russian Consortium on which the Secretary of State asks the opinion of the Government of India, is the construction of a railway line from Baku to Tehran, thence via Kum, Kashan, Yezd to Kerman, and thence to Nushki via Seistan.* It is stated that the construction of a railway in Persia is not an object complete in itself, but simply a means towards the realisation of “ a world route to unite by one contiguous line of rails Europe to India and other countries in the Far East”. j The more immediate object of the promoters appears to be the development of Russian r rade wi’h Persia, which is now threatened by the Baghdad Railway and the increasing- interest of Germany in the Middle East. It is also remarked incidentally that the line would secure Russians strategic position in Turkey and in Western Trans-Caucasia. The line is to be constructed as an international undertaking, the participants being Russia, Great Britain, France and possibly Persia. The cost of construction is estimated at 206,950,001) roubles and the possible profits at 15 per cent on the subsciibed capital. The Government of India are asked for their views on the question of railway connec tion in general and the particular proposal put forward in the Russian memorandum, and their advice is specially asked upon the commercial aspects of the project, and its immediate local consequences. 2. It may be convenient at the outset to offer a few observations on the general Advantages and question of the pros and cons of a connection by land between Europe and India by way of a Qf^aUway 598 Trans-Persian Railway. connection. The question may first be considered from the point of view of the defence of India Europe and against foreign invasion. By the operation of the Anglo-Russian Convection we are secured India, for the present from the fear of a Russian invasion ot India, but in the nature of things («) Strategical the possibility of hostilities with Russia at some future date cannot altogether be ignored. aa(i poetical. In view of this possibility it is clear that any material improvement of land communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India,—respons.bilities ,which are already inconveniently heavy. From the purely strategical point of view therefore it would undoubtedly be preferable that India should maintain her ^an-insular position and should refuse to co-operate in any scheme which would tend to facilitate the transportation of a hostile Power up to or across her frontier. We recognise, however, that the march of events in the Near and Middle East renders it impossible that this position of isolation can be indefinitely maintained. Th^ advent of the Ba O' hdad Railway combined with the impotence of Persia must inevitably disturb the quo, while the prospect of a Russo-German combination in the event of our refusal to co-operate in the Russian scheme compels us to reconsider the position from a wider outlook. From this standpoint it seems to us desirable to seize the opportunity which the present proposal offers for securing the conditions which we consider essential rather than to wait until circumstances may force us to permit the connection on terms which may be less advantageous.. ^ -£ .3. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, we m commercial, are in (jeneral agreement with the opinions expressed in the letter from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office of L3th September 1910 and in Mr. Worthington’s memorandum forwarded ■ therewith. We do not consider that there is any likelihood of goods being, carried on the railway from the United Kingdom to India or vice-versa. The cost of transport by sea, especially to the south of India, will always be cheaper than by rail, and the sea route will , have the further advantage of avoiding the re-handling of the goods at a continental port and . at the points at which breaks of gauge may occur. We are inclined to doubt . also whether the through passenger traffic on the railway would be of any great magnitude. The volume of such traffic between the United Kingdom and India is not very large or likely to increase in any consi lerable degree, since there is no emigration to India such as is carried on the trans-Siberian line; and it seems probable ihat a reduction in farts would enable the steam-ship companies to retain the bulk of the existing traffic. As regards the local traffic northwards from India into Persia, no doubt the railway would lead to some development of this trade, ■ but it is imposs ble to form any estimate as to the amount of such increase in view of the wide difference between the conditions under which the traffic is now carried on and those which would be created by the existence of the railway. The natural channel for Indian trade to Persia is „ * A subst-qaent telegram from the Secretary of State, dated 30th December, shows that the Russian Consortium now favour an alignment via Tehran, Ispahan, YVzd, and Kerman, but that the Russian Government prefer that the line should ruu from Tehran south-east to Kerman to avoid the possible risk of eventual intersection by a German line at Ispahan. : i4 25 Net revenue anticipated by the Consortium is ... Taking the Rouble a8=Rs. 1-9-0 in Indian currency, the net revenue will be Taking working expenses at fi0°/ o the gross earnings, to secure this revenue must be ... ••• ••• ••• The length of the line from Baku to Nushki being 2,150 versts or 1,400 miles, in order to produce the gross receipts above given, the line must earn per mile per week the sum of ... ••• Roubles. 1,18,00,000 Bb. 1,85,00,000 4,62,00,000 655 tbroueh the ports of the Persian Gulf, and we have little doubt that the construction of line, from those ports into the interior would be of much greater benefit from the purely commercal point of view than the construction of the through line. We may note here that we are unable to accept as in any way accurate the the L ZZ the calculations shown in the margin it would appear that the estimate of the Consortium ia based upon the assumption that the proposed hoe will earn per mile per week the sum of Rs. 655. Judging by the earnings obtained upon our Indian frontier railways, we anticipate that the gross earnings per mile per week over the whole of tbe proposed line can hardly be expected to exceed Rs. 120 per mile per week or |th of the Consortinm'a estimate. The estimate given by the Consortium of the cost of construction is also, in our opinion, an inadequate allowance. Persia is a mountainous country, labour will be scarce and communications during construction didicult. With a line of the character proposed large profits will bi expected from con tractsand the supply of material, and judging from the cost of lailway construction in country of a similar character m India, we fear that the cost of the proposed Trans-Persian connection will exceed the estimate of the Consortium by at least 50 per cent. The proposed line can, therefore, hardly be expected to prove a financial success. At the same time the existence of a railway which would open no the country could hardly fail to produce a general expansion of trade in Persia. Improved communications will mean the gradual removal of those obstacles to commerce arismo- from the disturbed state of the country; from the difficulties relating to exchange and remittance; the long delays between the placing and execution of orders; and the impracticability of efficient supervision and control of agencies. But we cannot avoid the conclusion that a line following the route proposed by the Consortium would be far more advantageous to Russian than to Indian trade, though this result might be neutralised to some extent if we were able to secure that branch lines shon'd be simultaneously constructed to connect the Gulf ports, such as Bandar Abbas and Bushire, with the mam line. We also consider that it would be essential that stipulations should be insisted upon to insure that there shall be no differential treatment on any part of the railway for the nationals of any country in respect of rates, fares or general facilities. 4. While, therefore, from the point of view of military policy there can be little question that the maintenance of the status quo would be preferable to the construction of the proposed railway, and while it seems at least doubtful whether the advantages to Indian trade would be at all commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to Russian trade with Persia, or with the financial outlay involved in the undertaking, we are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be made in Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining conces sions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, jbe Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade. Alignment of the main through line. 5. We will now proceed to examine in detail the various proposals which have been made and to set forth the conditions which we consider to be essential before the Government of India agree to participate in tbe proposed undertaking. The first question to be considered is that of the alignment of the main through line between Russia ani India. With the northern portion of the alignment between Baku and Yezd we are only remotely concerned, but we think it right to notice that the alignment proposed by tbe Consortium, viz., Tehran, Kum, Kashan, Ispahan and Yezd, is preferable on commercial grounds to the direct line from Tehran to Kerman proposed by the Russian Government, since the latter would leave untapped the important trade centres of Kum, Kashan and Ispahan. 6. From the Indian point of view the important part of the alignment is that by which the railway approaches the frontier of India, namely, the portion from Yezd onwards. Three alternative routes have been suggested, namely,— (1) The proposal of] the Consortium, which is also favoured by Sir Henry McMahon, for a line from Yezd to Kerman and thence across the desert to Seistan and Nushki. Length approximately 810 miles. (2) The route suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, viz., Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Regan, Bampur, Sarbaz, thence across the Perso-Briti«h frontier near Kej and thence to Karachi or Hyderabad. Length approximately 1.117 miles. (3) Tbe route advocated by the Indian General Staff, viz , Yezd to Bandar Abbas and thence along the coast to Karachi. Length approximately 1,34)1 miles.The relative advantages and disadvantages of these three routes are examined in the succeeding paragraphs:— If the object of the proposed railway be taken as the connection of Russia with India (1) Yesd-Ker- by the quickest, cheapest and easiest route, this alignment seems to be preferable to S an ;? ? 4 8 ^ n “ either of the other two which have been suggested. The distance between Yezd and ment. 1 * Nushki via Kerman and Seistan is 810 miles only as compared with 1,147 and 1,341 miles between Yezd and Karachi by the other two routes: and although Karachi is immeasurably superior to Nushki as a point of junction with the Indian railway system and as a distributing centre for goods, the difference in length between the Nuskhi and Karachi routes remains an important factor in the situation. There would, it is true, be engineering difficulties to surmount in crossing the mountains which surround Kerman, and the scarcity of fresh water in the desert between Kerman and Nasratabad and between Robat and Nushki might also be a source of considerable inconvenience. But the route lies in the main through flat country which, as would appear from the reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns in 1903, would present few obstacles to railway construction. It is also a point in favour of this alignment that it would give access to the rich and well-watered tract of Seistan, which, in the opinion of so well-informed an authority as Sir H. McMahon, is capable of rapid development if a market can be found for its surplus products. But against these advantages have to be set objections, both strategical and political, the importance of which can hardly be overstated. To take the political objections first— it cannot be doubted, in view of the attitude taken by the Amir of Afghanistan towards tho Anglo-Russian Convention, that His Majesty will regard the construction of a railway along his southern border as a further indication of a design on the part of Russia to impair his independence, if not to absorb his territories. This aspect of the question has been touched on by Sir H. McMahon in paragragh 15 of his report, but with all respect to his authority we doubt whether he has adequately recognised the gravity of the objection to the Seistan-Nushki alignment on this score. However baseless the idea may be, there will not be wanting advisers who will put a sinister construction on the project in its relation to Afghanistan and w • fear that the alarm and suspicion that will be engendered may give rise to tribal excitement which may prove beyond Hss Majesty's power to control. The construction of the line would in fact prove to be a potent instrument in the hands of those who make it their business to sow ill-feeling between the British Government and the ruler and people of Afghanistan, and we apprehend that the process of restoring confidence might involve us in undesirable complications with the other Powers who will be interested in the undertaking. Even if this be avoided, there is the risk that trouble may arise between ourselves and the Amir over the distribution of the water of the Helmand on which the development ef Seistan largely depends. The strategical objections to the Seistan-Nushki alignment are even more cogent. The adoption of this route would give to Russia a railway leading directly to the frontier of Afghanistan, and would enable her, in the event of war, to turn the Kandahar and Quetta positions. It would also facilitate the transportation by Russia of a very large army across two almost waterless deserts—a task which, under present conditions and without the help of a railway, may be regarded as practically impossible of accomplishment. As against this, India would receive no compensating strategical advantages. A line *.o Seistan from Nushki might to some extent assist India to control Western Afghanistan, but no point is offered from which a force from India could undertake offensive operations against Russia; while the extension of our line to Seistan would make it difficult to resist a claim on the part of Russia to connect the Trans-Caspian Railway with the proposed route, in which case she would be able to concentrate from two directions. Finally, the adop tion of the Seistan-Nushki alignment would, owing to its distance from the sea coast, completely neutralise the strategical advantage which Great Britain possesses in her naval supremacy. These objections are, in our view, of so grave a character that the Government of India would be justified in offering the strongest opposition to the proposal for railway connection between Russia ana India via Kerman, Seistan, and the Nushki route. 7. We will now consider the advantages and disadvantages of the other two alignments (2) Yezd-Ker- which have been suggested, namely, Yezd-Kerman-Bam-Bampur-Kej-Karachi and Yezd- man-Bam-Bam- Bandar Abbas-Karachi, and would preface our remarks by explaining that information regard- chi'*a'ni'(^)Yezd ing these two routes is confined to that obtainable from the route books, which furnish very Bandar Abbas- inadequate material for judging the suitability of the routes they describe for railway construe- Karachi align- tion. Our recommendations must, therefore, be considered as subject to modification after m 0hts. actual railway surveys and investigations have been made. It.is obvious in the first place that the political and strategical objections which apply to the Seistan-Nushki alignment do not apply with the same force to either of the routes above mentioned. A line connecting Kerman or Bandar Abbas with Karachi would be far removed from the Afghan border and would not excite the apprehensions of the Afghan people in any acute degree, while the selection of the sea coast route would enable Great Britain to make effective use of her naval supremacy in resisting any possible hostile attack by way of the proposed railway. It would also, as Colonel Cox points out, provide effective means for checking the arms traffic through Mekran. These considerations, in our opinion.■ 27 f 7i; % . Branch lines- (l) Tn the British zone. (2) In the neutral zone. * Colonel Cox mentions three possible points at ■which the line might touch the coast* viz., Gwetter, Gwndur and Pasni. We have taken the latter as being on the more direct route. Our remarks apply with slight modification to the routes via Gwetter aud Gwadur. render it essential that the Government of India should select the Karachi connection in preference to that viz Seistan and Nushki. Taking now the comparative advantages of the two routes ending at Karachi, we may first give a general description of the country on t' e Pasui, * Bampur, Bam, Kerman and Yezd alignment. The length of the route, as taken from the route books, is 1,147 miles Prom Karachi to Pasni (296 miles) the line would run in the vicinity of the sea shore; the grade would he level and the chief works would be those connected with the crossing of creeks and drainage from the hills. The only point of doubt in respect of this portion of the route is whether the fresh water supply for working locomotives would be sufficient. This is a matter which will need careful investi gation. At Pasni the lin« would turn to the north-west and running by a sloping, hilly country for 159 miles would cross a range 3,000 feet high, dropping beyond io a level of 1,500 feet. Prom this point there would again be a steady rise till about the 8U0th miley where a very sharp rise would have to be faced, the line to reach Kerman having to cross a ridge 8,400 feet high and dropping into the town beyond to 5,600 feet level. Prom Kerman to Yezd the line would be at a high level, but with no ranges of any height to cross. In the absence of any information as to the cost of making railways in Persia, it is difficult to frame any estimate of the cost of this section of the line. But labour and supplies •.would be scarce and, iu view of the engineering difficulties of the alignment, the cost of construction and cost of working would certainly be very high. In so far as we are able ito frame an estimate, we would put the cost rf the section between Karajhi and Yezd vid Pasni and Kerman at not less than 17 crores or rupees. Turning to the alternative route, viz , from Karachi along the coast to Bandar Abbas and thence direct to Yezd, the section as far as B.mdar Abbas should offer no particular difficulties as regards construction, and it would provide a level road to run over. Prom Bandar Abbas to Yezd the general slope of the country is easy and there is no abrupt rise such as is met on the Pasni-Kerman section. As an engineering proposition, therefore, the section from Bandar •Abhas to Yezd does not appear to be open to any great objection. We estimate the cost of constructing the entire line from Karachi to Yezd via Bandar Abbas roughly at 14 crores of rupees, as against 17 crores for the Yezd-Kerman-Karaehi route. As a through route between Russia aud India it would certainly be quicker than the Kerman route, though of greater Jength, since the easier grades would permit of a faster train service. This alignment also p ssesses the strategical advantages— (1) That it avoids bringing the through line to Kerman, which is only 289 miles from the Afghan border. (2) That the entire route from Bandar Abbas to Karachi will lie sufficiently near the coast to allow the co-operation of the sea and land forces of the Empire in its defence. * ‘ • . ii ' . ; The Bandar Abbas-Karachi coast line would, it is true, do little towards devel oping trade with the interior of Persia, but we would propose, if this route is adapted, that a branch line should he run either from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan and Bam with a possible later extension to Kerman. The connection of Kerman with a port on the coast bv means of a branch line would have this advantage over its inclusion in the main through route that it would enable Indian commerce to compete for the south-eastern Persian market on more favourable terms than would be the case if Russia were able to transport her goods direct to- Kerman. We would recommend, therefore, that on sti’afegical-and political grounds the Govern ment of India should express a strong preference for the connection with Karachi, and that, of the two possible routes connecting Karachi with the main line, they should'sejecc that via Bandar Abbas and Yezd as being the easier, quicker, more economical, and more advan tageous from the point of view of military defence. : ’ ' . ; i r 7 8. We have next to consider the important question of the branch fines to be constructed in the event of the proposals for the through route coming to maturity* Assuming that the Kerman-Seistan-Nushki alignment is rejected, there will be ho absolute ■necessity from the commercial or strategical point of view for the construction of a branch from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, but, as we have already indicated, it would be most desirable that, with a view to the development of our trade with Persia, entry into the markets of south-eastern Persia should be secured by a branch line from some port on the coast within the British sphere. Whether this branch should lead from Bandar Abbas or from some other port, such as Charbar, we would leave for future decision after the routes have been examined, but we think it desirable that in the negotiations to be entered into with Russia it should be stipulated that it should be open to Great Britain to construct a branch line ‘ connecting Kerman with the coast by whatever route may prove to be the most convenient.. It is further important in our opinion to make it a condition of our acceptance of the main proposal that Russia will support us in obtaining such concessions for branch lines28 in the neutral zone as will operate to exclude Germany from obtaining a predominating position in the Persian Gulf. The lines which Colonel Cox recommends are:-— (1) From Mohammerah to Julfa. (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Kerman. (3) From Bandar Abbas to Shiraz. We concur with Colonel Cox as to the supreme importance of obtaining some such eoncessions as a cond tion precedent to our co-operation in the main through route. We are not aware how far Russia has pledged herself to support Germany in obtaining an outlet for the Baghdad railwav on the Persian Gulf. But there is clearly a danger that, if an agreement is not arrived at between ourselves and Russia on the subject of branch lines in the neutral zone, Germany may subsequently obtain such a position on the Gulf as must seriously jeopardise our interests, both commercial and strategical. We would, there fore, recommend that, in addition to sunportiug us in obtaining a concession for a line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam and Kerman, Russia be asked to uo-operate with us in securing concessions for railway lines— (1) From Mohammerah to Hamadan, or to such point between Mohammerah and Julfa as will intersect the extension of the Baghdad Railway between Khanikin and Tehran. (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Bandar Abbas. (3) From Bushire to Shiraz and thence to Ispahan . These concessions should, we think, be adequate to prevent the intrusion of the German line into the neutral zone, provided that a guarantee is obtained from Persia that she will grant no other concessions in this zone which are likely to compete with the lines which we have indicated. The lines from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam or Kerman and from Mohammerah northwards should, we think, be proceeded with simultaneously with the construction of the main line; the other concessions would not necessarily be utilised in practice, but would be retained for blocking purposes. Meanwhile, it would be an advantage to make detailed surveys of all the proposed routes in order that there may be no unnecessary delay when once it is decided to proceed with any particular scheme. 9. We observe that the Consortium contemplate the internationalisation of the through Internationalis- line. We think that in view of the recent negotiations between Russia and Germany in ttirou g l1 regard to the connection of the Baghdad railway wita the through Persian line, it is of para- ^a e8 . r a n c mount importance that the through line should be international. Otherwise we are faced with the possibility of a Russian line being constructed through Northern Persia linked witn the Baghdad railway and operating by differential rates to the detriment of British trade. We consider further that it would be au advantage, with a view to maintaining full oppor tunities for the development of trade, that all branch lines made within Persia itself, should be internationalised. As to the Powers which should be admitted to participate in these int rnational projects we can offer no useful opinion. But we assume that Russia and Great Britain will retain a preponderating share in the undertaking, and that any financial responsibility incurr d by the latter will be borne equally by the Indian and Imperial exchequers. We think also that it would be a distinct advantage to offer a certain number of shares to the Persian Government with a view both to enlist their interest in the successful working of the line and to obviate any suspicion that the project is likely to affect the integrity of Persia. Should this be decided*, it would be necessary to stipulate that Persia should not part with her shares without the consent of Russia and Great Britain. 10. A subsidiary question which has to be considered is that of the gauge to be adopted The question for the through route, and the place where the break of gauge, if there is to be one, should of gauge. be located. We are of opinion that from the point of view of the security of India, it is of the utmost importance that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zone in Persia should be different from that of the line passing through the Russian zone. We also think that India should have the right to select the gauge for this section and that it should be narrower than the gauge on the northern section of the line : since a hostile Power would find it much more difficult to widen a narrow gauge than to lay a line within a broader gauge. We think that, from the Indian point of view, the most suitable place for the change of gauge would be at a port on the Gulf, and we recommend that Bandar Abbas, which is on the border of the British zone, be selected for tue purpose. 11. There is one further point which we desire to mention before closing our report. It will be seen from what has been said above that the governing considerations in determining the alignment for the through route are, in our opinion, those connected with the attitude of the Amir and the effect of the proposed railway on the problem of the defence of India. It will be for His Majesty's Government to decide how far these considerations should be put forward in discussing the question with the Russian Government. But we suggest that, in dealing with a matter of such vital importance to India, it would not he out of place to state plainly to the Russian Government the reasons for which Great Britain is unable to assent to the Kerman-Seistan-Nushki connection and to invite a frank exchange of views on the subject.29 It could be explained that from the British point of vi?w the preferable course is to maintain the strategic isolation of India and to avoid the outlay of vast sums of money on a project which offers but little prospect of financial success or of commarcial advantage; that inf agreeino- 1 . 0 co-operate with Eu^sii in the construction of the through hue, we are making a'considerable sacrifice; and that the only stipulations we think it necessary to make are such as will safeguard the vital interests of Great Britain. In return for this sacrifice it would, we suggest, hardly be too much to ask Russia to forego once and for all any design for the extension of the Trans-Caspian Railway along the border of Afghanistan in the direction of the Indian frontier—an extension which, in tue words of the Russian Consortium, “ would be strategically rather dangerous for the English We recommend therefore that, in addition to the other stipulations which we have mentioned, the acceptance of the proposed through connection be made conditional on the giving of a pledge by Russia that she will not at any time, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, entertain or support any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Pei so-Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones. Oonelmloa. 12. To summarise our conclusions we recommend that the Government of India accept the proposals of the Russian Consortium in principle, subject to the following modific ations and conditions (a) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi and not at Nushki; (5) that the route from Yezd to Karachi be via Bandar Abbas and thence along the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey ; (c) that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan, Bam and Kerman ; (ii) from Mohammerah to H amadan ; (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar Abbas via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; (i) that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory be international, Russia and Great Britain holding a preponderating share and Persia beiug admitted to participate; that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zona be different from that of the line in the Russian zone, and that the break of gauge be at Bandar Abbas on the limit of the British zone; that in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perso- Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones. 8tA February 1911,30 Enclosure No. 7. Vote to President, Railway Board's, Memorandum, dated the 6th January 1911. This note was written before I had the opportunity of seeing the Memo randum by the General Staff. It dealt entirely with the proposal of the Russian Consortium from the railway point of view irrespective of military and political considerations. J The only point I should like to modify is my estimate of 20 crores as the cost of a line from Karachi to Bandar Abbas. From the information I then had at my disposal it appeared that the cost of the line would be very heavy When the question was being considered subsequently by the committee I had access to route books of Persia and was able to make a section of the country along the coast and obtain a more accurate idea of the cost of making a line along it. 6 I would therefore ask that the figure of 20 crores which I originally estimated the Karachi-Bandar Abbas line would cost might be reduced to 9 crores.

They think that construction of Mohammerah-Dizful section holds out fairer prospect of proving remune rative provided that a substantial proportion of Kermanshah traffic could be secured. This section would apparently be cheap and easy to construct. krti CTVV7'A [This Document is the Property of Britannic Majesty’s Lernment.] EASTERN DEPARTMENT. / u SECRET SERIES. \ \V [August 21.

The result forms vart ii ol his report. [2150 x —4] B2. The supplementary tracing which I have asked him to prepare, and which, if laid over his map,* will indicate the course of his subsidiary wanderings, will show that he has made a comprehensive examination of the tract within the limits of which a practicable alignment might conceivably fall, and the result of his investigations is to confirm the pviwid facie impression formed by previous tiavelleis, c.q., Sn Thomas Gordon and Captain Lorimer, that the best alignment would be found either up, or to the west of, the Kashgan valley. The full details, which are furnished in Part III of the present report, in regard to both alternatives, will, it is hoped, enable railway experts to arrive at definite conclusions as to the practicability and probable cost of a railway through this piece of country, which, on the grounds explained by him, Lieutenant Wilson is convinced is the only one which cap be regarded as reasonably practicable. For the cheaper of the two alignments, taking the distance from Moham- merah to Dizful as 174 miles, and from Dizful to Khoremabad as 185 miles— total 359—he estimates that the cost per mile will work out to 6,395Z. for the 5-feet gauge and 4,460Z. for a metre gauge line, and favours the latter alternative. °3. In the course of his deputation, Lieutenant Wilson has incidentally given much thought to other aspects of the contemplated railway than the purely practical one, and in Part I of his report he endeavours to marshal the principal, general, and political considerations affecting the project considered both independently, and in their bearing on the Gulf section of the Bagdad Bailway, as they now present themselves to his mind. The trend of his arguments on the whole is in favour of a rest on our oars for the present in regard to the pushing of the project, at all events, in respect of the section from Dizful onwards. 4. The salient points of his observations appear to me to be these :— (1.) In the course of his return journey he passed through Bagdad, and had the advantage of discussing recent developments with Mr. Lorimer, who had just returned from Constantinople. As the result of their deliberations he is convinced that the construction of the Bagdad-Gulf section is essential to the preservation of our interests in Bagdad itself and in Mesopotamia generally, and further that it would be premature to despair of our ultimately obtaining a predominant part in the management of the Gulf section. (2.) That in any case the Bagdad-Bussorah connection will pay even if deprived of the Persian trade which may be deflected to the Mohammerah line, and that consequently the building of the latter line, though it may delay the construction and reduce the profits of the other, will not prevent its eventual completion. He doubts, therefore, whether the Mohammerah line will prove, except temporarily, to possess so much competitive or political advantage as is at present supposed. (3.) He is inclined to share the apprehension which the Sheikh of Mohammerah recently expressed,j* that the piercing of the Luristan “ buffer ” may have the effect of destroying the territorial isolation of Arabistan, to which, combined with our consistent support, Sheikh Khaz’al Khan, in a great measure, owes the present strength of his position. This apprehension would be accentuated if the line were made international. (4.) He thinks that owing to the chronically disturbed state of Luristan, we may find ourselves obliged to intervene to protect the line. The foregoing and other minor considerations bring him to the view that no action should be taken by us beyond Dizful unless the German or Turkish attitude in regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Bailway forces it upon us ; and that from Dizful north- wards we should rely for the present on our road concession to maintain the commercial interests which we now possess in the markets focussing at Hamadan. 5. I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my discussing in detail the many points raised in his report, especially as there is, in regard to several of them, scope for wide difference of view, or even for the use of the same facts for argument in an opposite direction. On the whole, the conclusions to which Lieutenant Wilson is led, brings us to a position which, speaking broadly, does not differ greatly from that indicated in Sir George Barclay’s telegram No. 68 of the 27th February to the Foreign Office, and in my telegram of the 17th March, [j: There are certain aspects of the question, however, on which I venture to touch briefly. * Not reproduced. f Resident to Government of India, May 14; Resident to Minister, May 14, 1911. + r 4o His Majesty’s Minister, No. 45, of which a copy was forwarded to the Roreiam Department with my letter of March 19, 1911.3 6. Firstly I would observe that we seem warranted in considering that the strong disapproval with which the announcement of our application for an option or concession to constiuct this line was received in Russian and German quarters is in itself primti facie evidence of the value of the project to us, both as a means,of safeguarding the commercial interests which we already possess in the region of which Hamadan is the centre, and as a, lever tor obtaining satisfactory terms in regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. 7. The Apprehensions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. —I am inclined to doubt if the grounds tor them are so serious as the sheikh and Lieutenant Wilson anticipate. I presum3 m this connection that we should take all possible steps to safeguard the sheikh s interests, and m any case, the connection of Tehran by rail with Kermanshah and of Mohammerah with Dizful, would inevitably make Mohammerah more accessible from lehran than now, and I doubt whether the more ability of a Persian reoiment to cross Luristan would greatly alter the position, as far as the sheikh is concerned. From a financial point of view the latter could not fail to benefit greatly from the construction of the line. As it is, the customs revenue has greatly increased since he resigned it to the central Government ten years ago, in return for an annuity which then represented a much larger percentage of the receipts than it does now, and should a fuitlier development of Mohammerah as a port of entry take place he would ceitainly be entitled to our support in pressing for a substantial increase of his present compensatory allowance. 8. The Value of the Khor Musa ^ Outlet for the Railway.—Lieutenant Wilson’s somewhat pessimistic views of the possibilities of Khor Musa as a commercial terminus do not take into account its strategical advantages, and generally differ a good deal from the conclusions arrived at by His Majesty’s naval authorities when the locality was examined in 1904 (vide the papers marginally cited, to which I beg reference).* 9. Ihe Question of Internationalisation. —This is an aspect of the railway project which I should regard with great apprehension did I not presume that it was intended’ and would be possibly, either to circumvent the difficulty altogether or to effect an arrangement for keeping the control sufficiently in our hands in the way suggested by i iic In this connection Captain Haworth suggests^ to me, and I beg that the point may be considered, that the mere existence and the nature of our engagements to the bheikh of Mohammerah—of which the Persian Government, and I, believe, the Russian Government are generally aware—make it possible for us to claim independently of ar^ Anglo-Russian convention, that Mohammerah territory is a sphere of British influence, in the development of which we are entitled to have a predominant voice and which we are under no obligation either to regard as neutral ground except vis-a-vis Russia, or to admit the intrusion therein of any foreign element except under conditions conducive to our own interest and those of the sheikh. Whether or not this view can be strictly maintained in theory, it is a fact that we have more than once in recent years made _ effective use of it in practice, and our special position has, I submit, received tacit recognition. I may instance our negotiations with the Netherlands Government in regard to the Dutch option for an irrigation concession on the Karun aia om fiank communication to the Xurkish authorities in connection with the Zain incident. § „ 10 - Tmmmg to the present aspect of the railway question as indicated by the re usa oi the Government of the day in Tehran to accede to our application for an option, I venture, in conclusion, to offer the following suggestion :— That we should forthwith secure a lease from the Sheikh of Mohammerah of the shores and _ islets of the Khor Musa. These are a recognised part of the Fallahieh istrict which was granted to him by Royal farman in January 1903. The sheikh wou d be m precisely the same position in respect of a lease of it as he was in the case o he oil company’s site on Abadan, of which his ownership is covered by a farman in exactly similar terms. If any action in this direction were decided upon, it would be important to put through the necessary preliminaries, such as an unobtrusive examina tion of sites, with as little delay as possible. || The possibility in the last resort of preventing a concession going to other parties + ^ l0 r et ° Govcroinciit of India in the Foreign Department, Secret letter, March 24, 1904.

P. z. COX, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant‘Colonel Cox. q. Bushire, July 25, 1911. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith my report on the proposed Aohamrnerah- Khoremabad Railway, which I take the liberty to summarise briefly below 2. I estimate the cost of the whole line to be about 2,335 000L from Mob am met ah toKhoremabad, equivalent to about 6,480L a-mile for 360 miles, on a ruling gradient of 1 in 50. The above figures are for Russian gauge (5 feet). At metre gauge the approximate cost would, I believe, be 1,650,0001. , 3. I believe the project to have a fair prospect of commercial success were metre gauge to be adopted, though there seems even then to be no likelihood of it being worth while for any British company to build it without a guarantee from the British or 4. On the general question of its effect on British strategical, political and com mercial interests, I express, with the greatest deference my belief that our strategical position vis-d-vis Russia will not be substantially altered by the raflway if built but I regard its probable effect on our political interests m the Gulf and in South-West eisia generally with some apprehension. The tendency of the railway will be o wea en e autonomous position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, thus paving the way for a recrudescence in Arabistan of the anarchy which reigns supreme every where else m Persia, and which so handicapped our commerce in the years 1889-189o between the opening of the Karun and the accession of the present sheikh. i i j 5 Its inception will make the construction of railways m the north by Russia, and the continuation of the Khanikin line to Kermanshah inevitable, ff indeed this is not already the case, though of course the converse of the proposition equally Smce the Persian Government, as far as we can see, are not likely f° a ^ e ^ govern Luristan more effectively during the next decade than they have done m the past two centuries, we must face the contingency of being called upon to take our own measures for the protection of the line at some future time. The Lur tribes are no a all formidable enemies, in my opinion, but the possibility of being called_ upon to guard such a long line of railway will be a considerable addition to our commitments m this part of Persia, without, it seems to be, any commensurate gain to our commerce. An international expedition with the same object would be even more objectionable. The prospect of the line being placed under international control is not one that we can view with complacency ; it could scarcely fail to prejudice gravely our position m Arabistan, and would lead to complications with the sheikh. ^ 6. As regards the effect of the line on our commerce in Persia, I have expressed the belief that our predominance in the markets of which Hamadan is the centre will not be seriously threatened until Kermanshah is linked up with Bagdad, and that the projected Luristan line would not appreciably alter the proportion of British imports now con sumed, though it should lead to a substantial increase in the quantity of goods passing through the hands of British firms and imported and exported in British ships. Is main effect would be to displace the Russian sugar and hardware now entering from the north by the produce of Germany, France, and Austria (though imported, we may hope, by British firms) and Russian oil by the products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but the demand in Western Persia for the last-named commodity is not likely to assume importance for many years to come. . ,, 7. The effect of the proposed railway on the Bagdad-Persian Gulf line would, e,. I believe, to deprive the latter of a considerable proportion pf its upward traffic, ana impair its prospects of being financially profitable until irrigation on a large scale is introduced into Mesopotamia, but this result will not be attained unless the line is prolonged at once to Burujird at least.I cannot believe,^ however, that it will for long postpone the construction of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf line, nor permanently damage its position. I am much impressed with the inadequacy of the Tigris and the importance to us of a Bagdad-Bussorah Railway which will place the capital of Mesopotamia in close touch with British shipping and go far to help us to retain our position in Bagdad, if honestly worked. If Baodad is linked up with Europe, but not with the Gulf (and the Tigris is no substitute for a railway for this purpose) a hundred factors will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the Middle East, and a diminution of our political prestige will follow, a serious matter when it is remembered that Bagdad is the centre of the pilgum trafhc of large sections of the Mahommedan world. The Bombay mills, moreover, are indisputably destined to find in Mesopotamia a large and increasing market for their products. 8. I submit that we should use the Mohammerah-Khoremabad option only as a lever to obtain fair terms for ourselves on the Bagdad-Persian Gulf Railways, and that we should not take active steps (o build it unless forced to do so by, for instance, the prospect of the right to do so being granted to others, or by failure on our part to obtain a piedominant share in the Bagdad—Gulf section. In the latter contingency, I have advocated the^ construction of a Mohammerah-Dizful line, connected with Khoremabad and Burujird by good cart roads, for w r hich we already have a concession, in this way securing to ourselves most of the benefits of the railway without the political risks which, it is suggested, its construction would involve. 9.

Part I.—General and Political Considerations. WHILST fully realising that any decision on the part of His Majesty’s Government, m regard to the construction of railways in South-western Persia, must ultimately depend upon considerations of which I am for the most part ignorant, and regarding which I am not competent to express an opinion, it seems, nevertheless, convenient that I should preface this report on the practical aspects of the projected Luristan line by a brief summary of some of the principal general and political considerations affecting it, as far as I am aware of them. 2. The Attitude of the Russian Government. The attitude of the Russian Government to the Luristan project has undergone a notable change since 1907, and it had declared its strong dislike, on commercial grounds, of any railway which approaches the Russian zone from the south, whilst recognising our right to construct the Luristan line as far as Khoremabad, Russian Foreign [2150 x —4] Q6 Ministers have been unanimous in their belief that the Russian public opinion vvould be strongly opposed to any action by Great Britain in such a direction No great outcry however, seems to have been made by the Russian press winch has shown less interest in the matter than that of Germany, and Russia has been unable to_ ofter any valid reason for opposing us in this direction, whilst assisting Germany to join up Bagdad ' V lth Hostile *as Russia undoubtedly is to the project, it seems improbable that she will be able to press her objections so strongly as to affect materially whatever decision may be arrived at by His Majesty’s Government. Her need of British capital for railways m the north alone suffices to make her practically unable to offer determined diplomatic opposition to our proposals. . , She may, however, effectively oppose our entry into the Russian sphere by an extension of our line to Burujird, and may place obstacles m the way of any connection being made between our terminus there and Russian lines which may m the meantime, have been brought down from the north ; she might also hamper us by stipulating or international control, and by opposing the running of motor traffic on our roads, should we desire to initiate such between Khoiemabad and Burujird, for instance, or rom Burujird northwards. 3. Relation of the Project to and its effect on the Bagdad Railway. As long as 1891, M. de Morgan, chief of the “ Delegation Scientifique en Perse,” in his published reports, discussed briefly the Luristan railway project, and came to the conclusion that, as a commercial speculation, it could not bear comparison with the Bagdad-Kermanshah line, which had few physical difficulties to contend with. From the purely commercial point of view this seems not improbable, particularly when it is remembered that a Bagdad-Kermanshah line might form part of a great through route to India from Europe via Constantinople. But it woll connect Mtostern Persia with the sea by a section passing wholly through Turkish territory, and having its terminus in non-Persian territory, a state of things contrary to the interests of Persia generally. On the other hand, the principal shrines of the^Shi’eh faith are close to Bagdad, and thus even the passenger traffic on the Khanikin will be in itself a source of profit.* As regards good traffic: from Bagdad the stream of exports from Persia will inevitably flow towards the Gulf in the main, and imports will follow this route for the most part, whether the Persian Gulf-Bagdad Railway be constructed or not. It may be assumed, therefore, that the Bagdad-Kermanshah line will be remunerative from the first, even though it will be subject to the competition of the Luristan line, which would deprive it of a considerable portion of its goods traffic, and a part of its passenger traffic. Being shorter, and for the whole of its length in Persian soil, thus avoiding Turkish dues and exactions, the Luristan line will have an initial advantage which no reasonable adjustment of rates on the Turkish line could entirely neutralise. Even at present the weight of goods imported to and exported from Kermanshah via Khanikin, aggregates nearly 50,000 tons. I conclude, therefore, that the Luristan line would have a markedly unfavourable, but not ruinous effect on the Persian Gulf-Bagdad line, and to a much less degree yn the Bagdad Railway as a whole. Its construction might so reduce the prospective traffic on the Persian Gulf-Bagdad Railway as to make it impossible for the latter to earn enough to be financially profitable for some years to come, or until irrigation on a large scale has been introduced and extended in Mesopotamia, thus robbing the line of its attraction to investors. I cannot, however, believe that the construction of the Luristan line will for long postpone the realisation of the Bagdad-Gulf project, nor permanently damage the financial prospects of the latter; its effects are likely, however, to be sufficiently to make the threat of its construction a valuable lever when negotiating with Germany or Turkey. The value of the line as a lever will be small, however, unless prolonged beyond Khoremabad to the great commercial centres of which Hamadan is the chief, or at least as far as Burujird. From Bussorah to Bagdad by rail (350) miles is no further * The number of pilgrims from Persia who passed Khanikin in 1905 was 95,000; in 1910, 55,000, according to Turkish quarantine statistics; a considerable increase may be expected as a result of railway construction on this line.i than from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, and the former line will undoubtedly be cheaper to construct than the latter. I have suggested (paragraph 9) a rate of 4/. a-ton as the cheapest average rate we can afford to charge on goods between Mohammerah and Khoremabad. How does this compare with the actual river rates and prospective railway rates between ^ • Bagdad and Bussorah ? The following tables may throw some light on the point.— Statement showing Freights charged in 1910 on Goods between Bussorah and Bagdad and vice versa. Class. Imports. Exports. Total. Rate per Ton.

The average North-western Bailway (India) rate of 4‘72 pice per ton per mile, if applied to the Bagdacl-Bussorah line, would work out at 11s 5fd. a-ton; the average Indian rate of 5*5 pice per ton per mile would work out at 13s. 6|-d. per ton. The conclusion I draw from these figures is, that if Khoremabad is to be the distributing centre and terminus of the Luristan line, it will not be able to compete with Bagdad, which has great initial advantages over a small isolated town like Khoremabad. In order to fulfil its object the line must be prolonged at all events as far as Burujird. We have not given up all hope of participating in the Bagdad-Bussorah Bailway, the construction of which is of the greatest importance to us as a set-off to the Constantinople—Bagdad line, which will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the Middle East. Until we are forced to abandon hope of retaining a predominant share in such a line, it would seem to be against our interests to take any active steps towards the construction of a Luristan line, which is in itself politically and perhaps strategically objectionable, and which may ultimately prejudice our interests in Mesopotamia.8 Even were we to pursue the scheme, however, the necessity for us to join in building the Bagdad-Bussorah line would be none the less imperative m the interests ° f “'were*we”to'build°a°railway from Mohammerah to Dizful (a line costing but little and with every prospect of paying its way at metre gauge eventually, if the feeder roads to the north were built and properly organised), and to reserve to oursehes the ricdit to extend it to Khoremabad, we should prevent any possibility oi railway enterprise by other nations in this region, and at the same time retain m our hands a valuable lever to force the Turks to give us a predominant share m the ligns Valley Bailway Company when it comes to be formed._ &lt; ,, r m u i + It is scarcely necessary to add that there is no point south of Khoremabad except Dizful which could be made a terminus of the projected line, and the suggestions of the Bussian Government in this connection are quite impracticable. 4. Attitude of the Persian Government. The superior advantages of the Luristan Bailway over the Bagdad-Kermanshah proiect from the point of view of the Persian Government, if the former is alternative to and not in addition to the latter, is so strong as to need no laboured demonstration. It is to Persia’s interest that her exports and imports should flow m channels wholly within her borders and under her control, and that all the indirect benefits following on the establishment of an important port should accrue to her and not to the lurkish Government. It is to her interest to strengthen her hold upon her south-western provinces, and no more powerful interest than the railway now under discussion could he desired for the purpose. , ^ , -o • i i,- u No alignment between the northern end of the Gulf and Western Persia, by which I mean the country of which Kermanshah and Hamadan are the centres, will suit the Central Government equally well. The next best, from her point of view, would be a Mohammerah-Ispahan line, but this has been pronounced, after careful expert examina tion by Major W. B. Morton, B.E., to present prohibitive physical obstacles to a cart-road, from which it may he inferred that a railway is likewise impracticable. The rescript of Nasr-ud-Dm Shah m reference to a Tehran—Shushter railway is wel known, and need not be further referred to. The Persian Government may be expected, I conclude, ultimately to favour the project, though great difficulty will doubtless be met with in obtaining a concession on anything like equitable terms. It will probably be difficult to reconcile the rights of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in the matter, as guaranteed to him by us, with the claims and pretensions of the Persian Government. 5. Probable effect of proposed Railway on British Political) Strategical, and Commercial Interests. On this subject the view which I respectfully submit below may be summarised by saying that the prospect is unattractive as a commercial speculation, and its political disadvantages, which are ultimately largely commercial ones, outweigh, in my belief, any advantage which it may afford to our commerce in West Persia ; strategically the line would appear to be of small importance to us. The arguments against the construction of a line connecting Arabistan with West Persia may be summarised as follows :— We are already strongly established in Arabistan with sufficient security for our trade and with every opportunity for increasing it by extension of oil works, irrigation, &amp;c Whilst a light railway to Dizful would undoubtedly assist the develop ment of the province (as would also the Luristan road from Dizful to Burujird), the Karun at present provides a sufficiently good channel as far as Shushter for local requirements, and, as regards Dizful, there is nothing to prevent the utilisation of the Diz for that purpose to within 20 miles of that town. The Luristan line will contribute but little to the development of Arabistan (Mohammerah, of course, being excluded), as the agricultural products of the province must always go south, not north, by boat and not by rail, and it is from the south that the vast bulk of its needs must be supplied; if under international and not British control the line may lead to an actual diminution of our prestige and to all sorts of complications with the sheikh. Bussia’s economic and political progress southwards has hitherto been checked by the Zagros Mountains; if these be pierced by a railway our position in Arabistan will9 be weakened, and there is nothing to show that we shall obtain anything like adequate compensation in the markets of ^\ 7 est Persia, in which British goods greatly preponderate at present, and are likely to do so at all events until Kermanshah is joined up with Bagdad. The following figures for the foreign trade of Hamadan supplied by the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia may be considered, I think, to support this contention :— British trade— United King-dom—_ £ Piece goods (worth about 10(P. a ton) .. India— Spices, copperware, tea, cotton, yarn, thread, indigo • * .. 850,000 180,000 Total British trade , . • • .. 1,030,000 Bussian trade— Sugar Oil .. Glass, hardware, &amp;c. .. Irom from Ardabil .. .. .. ,, Cheap prints, &amp;c. .. .. .. ., •• 80,000 10,000 5.000 6.000 7,000 Germany, America, and France — Drugs, woollens, fancy goods, synthetic indigo .. Turkey — Skins, figs, dates • • 108,000 100,000 32,000 Total foreign trade .. .. # . 240,000 The construction of the railway w r ould probably cause a displacement of Bussian oil by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and of Bussian sugar and hardware by the produce of Western Europe, but it seems that British trade would only benefit by the general improvement in commerce that may be expected to follow upon the construction of the line. I do not forget that it is British firms who may be expected to import sugar and hardware in displacement of Bussian products, thus enabling them to increase their exports, but I do not think that the prospective profits under this head are likely to be sufficient to affect materially the situation as I have depicted it. We have built up considerable commercial interests in Arabistan under the security provided by the strong and autonomous regime of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. A railway connecting Arabistan with Western Persia can scarcely fail to weaken his powers, without bringing to him or to us any counterbalancing advantage. His rent’ roll will be somewhat swelled, it is true, but that will not compensate him for the destruction of the geographical isolation of his territories from the rest of Persia which will follow the construction of the railway. As for the Turks, he would sooner deal with them single-handed than with the aid of such a two-edged weapon as the armed assistance of the Persian Government. The temporary extension of the Persian Government’s influence and maleficent administrative activity to Arabistan from 1880 to 1895 was synchronous with a period of almost continuous disorder, which so hampered British commercial enterprise in the provinces that the opening of the Karun remained for years almost without effect and our trade was nearly strangled, and it is only now beginning to recover from the effects of that treatment. This state of things ceased only when Sheikh Khaz’al, by his wise and far-seeing policy, contrived to emancipate himself from the arbitrary interference of the Persian Government, patriarchically and without molestation, so long as he paid the Government revenue regularly, which he has done ever since. There is no reason whatever to suppose that an extension of the Persian Government’s facilities for inter ference will not have precisely the same effect in the future as in the past. The projected line will in no way meet Indian passenger traffic or mail require ments, and the advantage which it will secure to our commerce in Central Persia will presumably be neutralised to a large extent by Bussian railway construction advancing 'pari passu from the north. The construction of the Bagdad-Kermanshah line, if we have a predominant share in the Bagdad-Gulf section, will assist our commerce in an almost degree, and leave us relatively to Bnssia in much the same position we at present occupy in the markets of Central Persia. [2150 T] DFinally, * -ems improbable secure the safety of the railway i u , •, V a ][ ef ] on to send troops to molestation by the tribesmen; we might easily be called o th ^ h - - b - “rS.«of .h. * &gt;15 Sw ^ t ;*7.? r X,‘ and it is upon an increased export trade t be ga f d that Turkish obstruction increase in the volume of our uupor .

In any case, as long as w have naval predominance in the Gulf, the Luristan Railway ^ Russia, more particularly if its terminus be at Mohammerah, up the Shatt-el-Arab T&gt;iver and not at Kbor IVIusa. . -i xt-.^ It may also be argued, on the other hand, that ‘‘the time may come wRen the power of rapidly movin| a force to Tehran or its neighbourhood by so short a route from India may be of great advantage” (memorandum by Major Baird, D.b.O., date the 5 th June, 1907, printed by chief of staff’s division, India). Such prospective va u to us seems however, very problematic, as also its_ military value to Russia, an not think that we need have any serious apprehensions as to the strategical effec o e line ’g° n k^i 0 e S1 opinion, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the Parisian line is that the best course for us would be to build the Mohammerah-Dirful Railway as soon as possible and connect at once by a well-built road to Khoremab an&lt;1 FroTDizful to Hamadan by road is about 250 miles, from Bagdad to Hamadan about 325. We shall, then, be able to land goods at Hamadan at all events as c py via Dizful as we are now able to do via Bagdad, and far more expeditious^. JV hen t railway is completed as far as Bagdad we should then, and no i e S.’, S -i • i,- ur Dizful-Khoremabad section, in anticipation of the prolongation to Khamkm bemg built,* should we by this time have been forced to give up hope of controllmg. the Bagdad section, predominance on which would render the construction of the Lu line in my view, superfluous, in view of the political objections to it. There is, I understand, a possibility of the main line passing through Khanikin to Bagdad.It would probably be to the advantage of both ourselves and Eussia to prevent railway construction in Persia for another ten years, but as Germany seems to have succeeded in compelling Eussia, to abandon this policy, the course I have outlined above seems to offer the fewest objections. It involves no large outlay, and would probably be financially remunerative before long; it also makes no great addition to our commitments in this part of Persia. 8. Gauge of proposed Railway. We may assume that for our purposes there are three possible gauges, 5 feet, 4 ft. 8h in., and metre gauge. There would seem at first sight to be good primd facie grounds for choosing the Eussian (5 feet) gauge, which would facilitate the prolonga tion from Khoremabad to Burujird, which I believe to be essential to the success of the line, and the extensions thence to some point or points on the Eussian railway from the north when it comes to be constructed. But I have submitted in the succeeding paragraph that it is only by building the line to metre gauge that we can ever hope to make it a financially sound proposition. This argument should suffice to outweigh any objection by Eussia against the break of gauge, which is in itself strategically most desirable. The financial argument has the additional advantage of enabling us to put forward strong reasons for a break of gauge on the border of the neutral zone no less than on that of the British zone. The 4 ft. 8 J in. gauge, as used on the Bagdad Eailway, enables a high rate of speed to be attained by heavy trains, but it is financially objectionable, and would be so on strategical grounds should the Tehran-Khanikin line be built to this gauge. The 2 ft. 6 in. gauge advocated by Sir T. E. Gordon is, I would submit, too small to be economical; it has only been adopted in India for a few bill railways of exceptional difficulty and some feeder lines in Southern India. The metre gauge is much the cheapest and can be used with sharper curvature than the broader gauges; the rate of speed is slower and the maximum load that a train can carry is less. As the Luristan line is never likely to be a mail or main passenger line, the slower speed seems unimportant; and as regards the traffic it could carry, though I can profess no expert knowledge on the subject, I venture to record my belief that a metre gauge will be ample for the requirements of the country for the next twenty-five years at any rate. Putting the train load at the low figure of 400 tons, one train a day would deal with 150,000 tons a year. This question is further dealt with in the next paragraph. Whilst considering the metre gauge for financial and strategical reasons in every way preferable, I have nevertheless estimated for a broad gauge line, whilst adding estimates for meter gauge as far as I am able to deduce them. 9. Financial Prospects of the Line. The estimates of cost of the line (5 feet gauge) are based on the same classification as that adopted by Mr. John for the Baluchistan line, which provided for 5 ft. 6 in. gauge, 62 lb. rails, w T ooden sleepers, and a small quantity of rolling stock, stations, &amp;c., on a moderate scale. Iron sleepers would, however, be undoubtedly necessary, owing to the prevalence of white ants and the temptation to theft which wooden sleepers would offes to the tribes. The details of the proposed alignments and their estimated cost will be found in Part II and III of this report. They may be summarised as follows (converted into £ from rupees):— Miles. 5-feet Gauge. Metre Gauge. Via Kuh-i-Dasht— Moh ammer ah-D i zf ul Dizful-Khoremabad Total .. ..

Considering the “stances of th^ sinking fund charges, and royalties to the ^ ^ than 200,0001. a-year or 5761. a-mile. This is 8 8 per cent., oi ™ie at 5t ner cent sinking fund at 2J per cent., and 8 per cent, or 18,0001. or 51. per mile for Royalties to the Persian Government. To earn this sum gross receipts totalling something like 640,0001, or nearly 1,8001. a-mile, must be earned - assuming the ratio of gross receipts to net receipts to be as three is to one, roughly speaking. At an averagtfrate ofabout 3d. a-ton per mile.t or 41 a-ton from Mohammerah to Khoremabad about° 170 000 tons must be handled to earn this sum, the vast proportion of whic mus be through traffic. I ignore receipts from passenger traffic as e ^ n the running expenses of passenger trams : a couple of coaches attached to a g train will pfobably be all that is required for some time to come. It is difficult to see any prospect of more than half the amount of goods traffic required being available for transportation by rail for the next twenty years at all events. . , The rate of 41. a-ton to Khoremabad may seem a high one, but it must b remembered that the Turkish duty of 1 per cent, is equivalent to a duty of more than U. a-ton on piece goods (when additional Turkish charges are taken into account , and probably not less than 2s. a-ton on wheat. In estimating the incidents of freigh s, therefore, these sums should be deducted from the rates charged on the Lunstan line. 11. Metre Gauge. If metre ^auge were adopted, net receipts would have to be about 140 000Z. a-year, at the same rate, and gross receipts 120,000Z., necessitating the handling o over 100 000 tons of goods per annum. ’ The weights of imports and exports via Kermanshah in 1910-11 were roughly as follows :— Tons. T , 42,000 Imports .. .. •• •• _ 3 000 Exports .. .. • • • • • • ' • Total 45,000 Allowing for goods smuggled for personal property, the total probably amounts^ to over 50,000 tons. Of this quantity only 25 per cent, is for local use^ the rest being forwarded mainly to Hamadan for distribution. The products of the Kermanshah a Hamadan districts are mainly exported to Kussia at present; a railway would certain y divert them to a large extent to the south. Such exports would piobably amount * Gross receipts of about 228Z. a-mile (180Z. a-kilom.) are guaranteed in the case of Bagdad Railway, f The maximum freights authorised ou the Bagdad Railway are as follows: Per Kilom.

One of the disadvantages of the Luristan line is that it would obtain very little internal goods traffic, as the Arabistan exports go south to the sea, and the requirements of the province are mainly supplied locally or from India. There is practically no exchange of commodities between this province and the rest of Persia, whereas there is a very large internal trade between Kerman- shah, Hamadan, Tabreez, Kasvin, Tehran, &amp;c., amounting to about 500,000/. per annum in the case of Hamadan. There is, therefore, reason to believe that eventually the bulk of goods transported would suffice to make a metre-gauge railway pay, since 30,000 tons of the Kermanshah imports and exports would probably be available at once, and a further 20,000 tons of exports now sent to Russia, may be expected to adopt this line, thus giving us at once half the total required to make the railway pay its way. The project, therefore, though unattractive as a commercial speculation, seems a sound one, though some sort of guarantee at first would appear inevitable. The Persian Government is obviously unable to give one : whether the situation justifies the British Government in doing so is a question beyond my competence, but I have already submitted that the railway is politically disadvantageous to us. Mr. Greenway in his letter of the 7th January, 1911, to the Foreign Office, states definitely that a Government guarantee will be necessary, because of the insecurity of the country. 12. We turn now to the question of a cart-road between Dizful and Khorernabad and Burujird. The approximate length of a cart-road vH Pul-i-Kurr to Dukhtar and Madian Rud would be— Miles. From Dizful to Khoremabad .. .. .. .. .. .. 154 From Dizful to Burujird .. .. .. .. .. .. 220 A metalled read, suitable to carry heavy motor traffic, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 25 to 1 in 30, with suitable serais and post-houses, and a telegraph line alongside, is what is wanted. We shall, I think, be on the safe side in estimating the average cost of such a road at not more than 600Z. a-mile all included, except the telegraph line.' :;: ' Such a road should be able to handle expeditiously, if properly organised, all the traffic likely to offer for a long time to come ; the capital involved is much less than that necessary for a railway, the prospect of it being damaged by tribesmen less, and the possible profits larger. Further discussion of this subject is not, however, germane to the present report, and I confine myself to suggesting with great respect that the possibility is one deserving of close examination at the hands of experts. (See also Part 5.) The Russian native agent at Burujird, in a detailed confidential report to his consul at Kermanshah, to which I obtained access when in the former town, reported that the imports of Russian goods into Burujird (part of which were destined for Khoremabad) aggregated 52,000Z. in value. Hamadan was the depot from which the needs of the district were supplied in all cases. The principal articles were (in order of importance) piece-goods, sugar, kerosene, matches, hardware, tea, and glass-ware, but the value under each category was not given. There is no doubt that the sugar and kerosene were of Russian origin, and also the glass-ware, and perhaps the bulk of the hardware, but the matches in use in Burujird are Swedish and Austrian, not Russian, though imported through Russia by Russian merchants. As regards piece-goods, the vast proportions are undoubtedly of British make, though Russian patterns are closely imitated. Mr. Macmurray, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Hamadan, reports on the 29th March, 1911, that “ nothing competes with Manchester goods here except a white material, which comes from looms in India.” Matches, hardware, and glass-ware are commercially of little importance, and as things now stand, therefore, the only articles of importance which Russia now supplies, and which we should furnish if the railway were built, are oil and sugar. The former will shortly be produced by the oil company at Mohammerah or Kasr-i-Shirin, but the total consumption of this product within Persia is likely to be but small for some years to come. The sugar now imported is at present almost entirely foreign, but there seems * * Approximate cost of telegraph line may be taken at not over 600 rupees a-mile.

The h Si If eh (some 350 feet above plain) are represented, near the Diz by hills not over 60 feet high, the Tul Raiyash hills, some 2 miles broad and 250 leet high, find no counter-part near the Diz. • j -u i ^ The comparative merits of route (1) and (2) are summarised below (1.) Via Aminieh (Length 174 Miles). iVonld afford alternative route between Ahwaz and Mohammerah in place of present river steamers, whose displacement would clear a way for utilisation of Karun waters for irrigation; the Karun irrigation scheme, however, is generally considered, apart from this, to be unprofitable, and its cost (500,0007) is so great as to make its inception impossible. Might suffer from competition of river traffic, as merchants might ship goods to Ahwaz for forwardment thence either by rail or via the Diz to Kal'eh Bandar. Local passenger and fast goods traffic, but incon siderable and probably insufficient to counter-balance loss by river competition. (2.) Via Kut Nahr Hashim (Length 164 Miles). Would facilitate adoption of the Karkheh irrigation scheme an unambitious measure estimated to cost m the first instance 75,0007, and returning net profit 20 Would secure all the Mohammerah-Dizful traffic and have nothing to fear from competition of river steamers, which would feed Ahwaz, Shushtar, an Ispahan as usual. Would give Arabistan a double set of communica tions (rail and river) serving separate areas, the one serving Dizful, Nahr Hashim, and Hawizeh; tfie other, Shushter and Ahwaz. The balance of advantage lies, I think, with the Kut Nahr Hashim route and thU is the line I recommend, though I estimate for the Aminieh route, which is si g J more expensive.15 17. Description of Country through which Line ivould pass. Mohammerah-Nahr Hashirn Section (86 miles). —Flat, barren, alluvial soil, not liable to flood except close to Mohammerah ; floods not sufficiently serious to demand facing embankments with stone ; only 6 inches to 1 foot of water, and only for a few r weeks. Little sand ; no stone ; practically no nalas or surface drainage channels. No vegetation. Water obtainable anywhere 15 feet to 20 feet by digging. Kut Nahr Hashim is 250 feet above sea, giving an average gradient from Mohammerah to Nahr Hashim of about 1 in 2,000. Nahr Hashim-Shaur Diver (16 miles). —Gently undulating ground; low ridge.s of soft rock which can generally be avoided, or cut through at low pass. Slope o ground to north still almost imperceptible. No drainage channels or nalas worthy of note. No permanent habitations. Sandhills frequent, but stationary, and offering- no obstacle. Stone from hills not good enough for use as ballast, has about the same consistency as half-burnt brick, crumbles rapidly. Shaur must be bridged, see below. Shaur-Shush (550 feet ; 45 miles). — Up to within 10 miles of Shush line follows west bank of Diz. Alluvial soil; no sand or stones; plentiful brushwood. 10 miles south of Shush grand, hills, about 60 feet high and ^ mile in breath, are encountered ; these offer no difficulty whatever, and will be valuable source of gravel for ballast. The line would probably leave Shush 2 miles to the west. Shush-Dizful (680 feet; 18 miles). —Over flat and, near Dizful, stony ground. Excellent ballast available from pebbles and boulders in Diz and Bala Bud. Two branches of Bala Bud to be crossed ; see below. Irrigated cultivation in many places. 18. Bridging. Khazalieh Canal behind Mohammerah. —Thirty-feet bridge necessary; 12 feet above ground. Shaur Diver. —This a mere ditch ; as it takes its rise level from springs near Shush, it is subject only to local floods. A 50-foot span resting on masonry buttresses on either bank should be ample. Alluvial soil. North of the Shaur for two miles the ground is subject to flood from marshes by the Kharur nala; pitching of stone or bricks will be required, and one or two culverts. Bala Dud. —Two branches to be crossed; river bottom and subsoil gravel; river changes its bed from time to time, unless trained; dry in summer; floods to 5 feet or 6 feet in spring, but not more. At certain points the bed of the stream is well defined ; at such points the breath of water at flood level is about 35 yards, normal spring level 20 yards. A bridge composed of three 60-foot spans, resting on masonry pillars would probably be economical. The above applies equally fco both branches. 19. Local Labour. The labour obtainable in Arabistan is of two kinds, Arab and Persian. The Arab, however, is too well off to be under the necessity of working with the spade for 2 krans (9d) a day, and is constitutionally unfitted for regular and strenuous work. The experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is that it is mainly upon Persian labour that reliance must be placed, but they have had no difficulty in obtaining 1,000 Arabs for work near Mohammerah. In Ahwaz and elsewhere in Arabistan, Persian (Lur) labourers are plentiful and fairly satisfactory. Usual pay 2 krans a day (9d.). Dizful labour is above the average, as it includes many skilled cultivators. Excavation is usually performed by basket and spade. The spade used locally is of a special long-handed type, but the experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is that Lurs adapt themselves readily to the European pattern shovel and pick. The French scientific mission at Shush have had the same experience ; they use light rails and trucks for removing spoil with good results, the Lur takes to them readily, long handed spades are, however, much used. Lurs, and also Arabs, work best in gangs under their own chiefs; unless some such arrangement is made, they are apt to get out of hand, but they are, on the whole, easily handled and amenable to mild discipline. Good bricklayers and masons are available in Dizful. 20. Gauge. The gauge of Bussian railways in the Caucasus (5 feet) would probably be chosen by the Bussiun Government for the north section of the Julfa—Mohammerah Bail way.and would presumably be accepted by us, as we could oppose no valid argument to its adoption. A metre-gauge railway would, however, probably suffice % all piobable requirements of traffic for many years to come, and would be, on financial grounds, in every way preferable. 21. Gradients. Practically flat the whole way, the hills at Nahr Hashim and south of Shush could be negotiated quite comfortably with 1 in 350 to 1 in 400. 22. Stations. Mohammerah. —The terminus at Mohammerah would of course be carefully designed to admit of subsequent enlargement. The site I suggest is on the Shatt-e - ra above the customs. It has a frontage directly opposite the accepted anchorage on t e Shatt- el-Arab, from which it would be easy to throw out piers; the customs-house is- Sab’eh.—A second station, or wayside halt at Sab’eh seems called for primarily m order to give facilities for wmter which can be obtained here from the Karun Nahr Hashim.—A station here would serve Hawizeh and eventually, should irrigation be undertaken, the Nahr Hashim district. Water obtainable from Karkheh. Dizful. —The station would be on west bank of Diz opposite town. Ihe abandoned Government house on west bank of Diz (Kushk) might well be utilised m this connection Provision for its occupation by the railway as storehouse, quarters lor stan, &amp;c., might be made in the concession. Water from Diz. 23. Fuel. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery at Braim, 5 miles fiom Mohammerah, ia conveniently situated to supply oil fuel in any quantity, and it will be unnecessary to import coal' The engines on the Bussian section of the line will be doubtless fitted to burn oil, and it is fortunate that the southern section should be not less favourably situated in this respect. . . . In the Kuilab district, 48 miles off Dizful, there are certain pitch spungs, indicating,, possibly, the existence of oil in paying quantities. Were a railway through Luristan to be opened, it is possible that the Oil Company would bore for oil there, as also at lang- i-Haleh near Madian Bud in Luristan. 24. Estimated Cost of Mohammerah-Dizful Section. Sir William Willcocks has estimated the approximate cost of construction and equippino 1 a railway of 4 ft. 8^- in. gauge in Arabistan at about 3,000/. a-mile. corresponds closely with Mr. W. A. John’s estimate (for Seistan railways) of 50,000 rupees a-mile for c£ surface line” 5 ft. 6 in. gauge. Taking the latter figure, the cost of this section would, vik Aminieh, be 87,00,000 rupees. Sir William Willcocks quoted his figure as an outside estimate. The total cost inclusive of special works is estimated at 633,333/. (vide paragraph 18). For metre gauge the cost should not exceed 500,000/. 25. Local Traffic. Dizful-Mohammerah. —Imports from Mohammerah and Amarah into Dizful are not large, probably not over 1,000 tons per annum. Exports are even smaller, owing to lack of communications. The existence of a railway would afford a stimulus to agriculture, and the exports of grain, reeds for pens, oil seeds, cotton, wool, gum, galls, &amp;c., would rapidly increase and might reach a total of 10,000 tons by the end of the third year. It is not probable that the railway, even were it to touch the Karun opposite Ahwaz, would be able to secure an appreciable proportion of the imports and exports which are now transported by steamer between Ahwaz and Mohammerah, and forwarded from Nasiri to Ispahan by mules. _ ... It seems certain, therefore, that the river steamers will always be in a position on this river, so long as it is not utilised for irrigation, to compete successfully with the railway. The necessity of transporting goods brought up by railway across the Karun to Basiri from Aminieh, the railway station on the opposite bank, a process involving17 double handling, would make shippers unwilling to use the line, particularly as the ocean going steamers can now unload straight into barges which are towed up to Nasiri without breaking bulk, and are passed through the customs there instead of at Mohammerah. Other Local Traffic. — Hawizeh may be expected to give 200 to 300 tons imports and 1,000 to 1,500 exports; this figure would probably be doubled in three years after the railway was in working order. 26. Reason why Mohammerah and not Ahwaz should he Terminus of the Raihcay. A brief note on this point seems necessary owing to the persistent public advocacy of Ahwaz as the terminus of this line by Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, who, as managing director of the “Euphratus” and “Tigris” Steam Navigation Company, presumably views with concern the possibility of competition by the railway between Ahwaz and Mohammerah with his steamers on the Karun. The Ahwaz-Mohammerah line will be cheaper ; the river boat service is slow^ and uncertain, owing to shoals, dust-storms, &amp;c. Landing facilities for cargo at Aminieh would be difficult, owing to shoals in river, which frequently changes its main channel. The river boat service, unless a very large increase of traffic took place, could not run more than two boats a-week ; and goods and passengers would run the risk of waiting three or four days at Mohammerah, if not more. The interposition of a river steamer service would involve two, if not more, additional handlings of the goods, involving expense and risk of breakage which is a heavy item in this country. 27. Reasons why Shushter should not he touched hy the Railway. ( 1 .) It would add about 20 miles to the length of the railway. ( 2 .) It would involve the construction of three large bridges on the Karun and its tributaries, and several minor ones, thus adding greatly to the cost ol the line ; the alignment via Shushter would, moreover, independently of the necessary bridges, be considerably more expensive per mile than that via Dizful. ( 3 .) It would involve negotiations with the Bakhtiari Khans in respect of the Shushter-Dizful section, and with the Shushteris in regard to the Band-i-Kir-Shushter section; both are difficult to deal with, particularly the latter, ( 4 .) Shushter is a decaying town, and would be so to a greater degree but for the fact that at present it serves as a depot for Dizful. Its needs are sufficiently supplied by the steamer service on the Upper Karun. The town is, however, mentioned in the Shah’s rescript referred to above, on the subject of railway concessions, and it appears in the British note to Persia on the subject. 28. Time required for Construction of Mohammerah Dizful Railway. Since construction could be started at half-a-dozen points without inconvenience (communication by river extending to within town of Dizful, close to the line of lailway), the rate of construction will depend chiefly upon the amount of labour employed. There would seem no reason why the line should not be completed within two yeais from date of commencement of actual operations. . . Labour is plentiful, work can go on all the year round, and as far as this section is concerned, practically nothing is needed but the simplest earthwork, and not much of that. . i u • i j 4 , Any concession for such a railway from the Persian Government should include the right to run steam- or motor-boats and barges on the Diz and Upper Karun foi the purpose of transporting material, &amp;c. 29. Persian Gulf Terminus: Reasons why Mohammerah and not Khor Musa should he selected^ The navigation of Khor Musa is not without danger, owing to the Ummul Siswan and Ummul Dibab rocks. It is destitute of fresh water, which could only be brought with great difficulty from near Fallahieh or Buzieh, 40 miles distant. I e w 10 e land for many miles round and inland is flooded twice daily at high tide, anc ai rer * The terms of our application of March 31, 1911, for a railway option were “ for aport at Khor Musa and for a railway northwards as far as Khoremabad, with a branch to Mohammeiah if ouuc cesira [2150 x —4 F18 north lie great marshes, impassable on loot for eight months m the year extending half way to Ahwaz. No measures could ever make Khor Musa a habitable port m my belief, and were the railway to be brought down to the coast at this spot the vast proportion of goods traffic would still find an outlet from Mohammerah, the Karun River steamers being used between Mohammerah and Ahwaz and mce versa. It goes without saying that no passengers would ever want to go to Khor Musa, and receipts under this head would be negligible. , j • i • * 4 .^ The climate of Mohammerah in summer leaves much to be desired, m spite of the amenities afforded by ice, fruit, and fresh vegetables in plenty ; but that ot Khor usa is tryinc to a degree which only those who have visited it (as I have) on severa! occasions during the summer months, can realise. The muddy shore into which the feet sink ankle deep at every step, is impregnated with salt, and becomes so hot that no native can wa barefoot on it; and for a European thick boots alone can save him from acute discomfort. Stinging gnats and flies from the adjacent marshes swarm by night and would make sleep impossible were it not for the fatigue caused by the long sweltering day. Hot winds blow by night as well as by day. , , Every consideration, I submit, points to Mohammerah and not Khor Musa as the proper terminus, and I have worked on this assumption throughout I quite realise, o± course, that it is desirable for us to have a blocking option, irrespective 01 Khor Musa, for political and strategical reasons. 30. Position of Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to Baihvay in Arahistan. The Sheikh of Mohammerah may he expected, in view of his close relations with the British Government, to co-operate with the latter in any scheme proposed by them for a railway through his territories. As the chief of a hegemony of all the Arab tribes in Arabistan, and responsible for their attitude to the Persian Government, it is upon him that we must rely to maintain order and prevent tribal animosities from impeding the progress of operations; the experience of ten years shows that he will not fail to o so. But his position as landowner must also be borne in mmd. He holds farmans granting to him, among other districts, that of Mohammerah, which extends up to the west bank of the Karun, to a point a few miles north of Sab’eh. From this point to Shush, 15 miles south of Dizful, the proposed alignment passes through the following districts, all of which are claimed, under farmans of the Shah by the present Nizam-es-Saltaneh,nephew 7 of the late Husain Kuli Khan, Nizam-es-Saltaneh, to whom they were originally granted. They are all leased to Sheikh Khaz al: (1.) Karun west hank. (2.) Kut Nahr Hashim. (3.) ’Anafijeh. (4.) Hussainabad. It would probably be easy to obtain unirrigated land free of cost, and thus reduce the cost of acquisition of land to a small figure, as the railway would pass through irrigated land only at the terminus, Mohammerah, and near Dizful. ° Were it decided to commence construction of this line the first step would be to conclude an agreement with the sheikh by which he undertook responsibility^ for the safety of tiie line, and granted the necessary land at a fixed price. The Nizam-es- Saltaneh might be left to put in his claim for compensation in respect of the cultivated lands or the lands intermittently cultivated which have been appropriated for the use of the railway and which he may claim as his own. The lands in the neighbourhood of Shush belonging to the Nizam, have been leased to a Russian subject for twenty-five years, but he is not likely to be in a position to raise serious difficulties, and his lands could be avoided if necessary by keeping west of the Shaur till Shush was passed, or by keeping east of the Diz, crossing it again near Dizful. ' 31. Possible Tribal Opposition outside Sheikh's Territories. I think it improbable that any serious opposition to the construction of the line, or of any serious attempt to interfere with it wffien constructed, would be experienced. A hundred armed men supplied by the sheikh would be ample to protect the camps from occasional raiding parties of trans-frontier Arabs, and the Persian Government could be induced to consent to the employment of pioneers from India, their double role of workmen and soldiers would stand them in good stead and probably greatly facilitate19 rapid construction. Moreover, their position and duties as pioneers would conceal to a large extent their military role and enable their services to be utilised without causing great alarm to the Persian Government. The presence of Lur tribes, mainly Sagwand, in the neighbourhood of Shush and Dizful might cause some slight difficulty, but these tribes take readily to manual labour, and the advent of the railway, with the consequent demand for unskilled labour, would be welcome to them. In any case, the support of their chiefs could be obtained without great expense. 32. Total Cost of Arabistan Section. Adopting the Aminieh alignment for the purpose of my estimate, and assuming broad gauge to be desired, as elsewhere, I deduce the following estimate of cost:— 174 miles 4; surface line,” at 50,000 rupees a-mile Special works— (1.) Mohammerali terminus wharf, &amp;c. .. (2.) Aminieh ferry service, wharves, tramway above rapids, &amp;c. (3.) Repairs of Dizful Bridge .. *. Rupees. 87,00,000 6.50,000 1 . 00,000 50,000 Total .. .. .. .. .. 95,00,000 = 633,000L (3,640f. a-mile). At metre gauge the total cost should not be over 500,000Z. Special works (2) and (3) require some explanation. If Nasiri is to be served by the railway, some provision must be made for a ferry service and proper landing places on either side of the river. Provision must also be made for a light tramway, or slidings, connecting the Aminieh station with some convenient point above the rapids whereby goods can he transferred direct to steamers on the Upper Karun. The repairs of the Dizful bridge is a most necessary undertaking, in order to ensure traffic between the railway and the town being uninterrupted, and attended with less peril than is now the case, the centre span being unfenced and very rickety. Part III.— Dizful-Khoremabad Portion of Alignment. ■ 33. Alignment of the Railway through Luristan. We must now consider the alignment of the railway through Luristan, it being assumed that Dizful is the point of departure in the south, and Burujird the objective in the north. The limits within which an alignment for a railway between these two places must be sought are, broadly speaking, the Dizful-Kiyalan Dalich-Khoremabad- Zagheh-Burujird route to the east, and the Kaleh Saidmarreh-Gulgul-Dureh- Khoremabad-Bairarwand-Burujird route on the west. There is a general consensus of opinion, with which I am in full agreement, that east of the Kiyalan route no practicable alignment even for a mule track can be found ; the idea, which has been prominently mooted in the public press, of selecting an alignment via the Ab-i-Diz valley must therefore be dismissed at once as impracticable. Sir Henry Bawlinson (1844) writes of it from personal experience as follows :— “ From the Tang-i-Bahrain (south-east of Burujird) the Dizful River forces it way through a succession of chasms and gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly impracticable. Indeed, this part of the Zagros is so very precipitous that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird; it is followed by nomads on foot ; it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is considered the most difficult of all mountain pathways. It breaks into the Sahra-i-Lur (north of Dizful) between the hill forts of Tangawan and Kafeh-i-Shahi.” Major Bell (1884) and Major Sawyer (1889) (the latter surveyed much of the district) confirm these conclusions, as also does M. de Morgan (1891) from personal experience (p. 167, vol. ii). On the other hand, the adoption of any alignment west of the Saidmarreh-Kuh-i- Dasht line would increase the length of the railway out of all proportion to any economy that might be secured thereby; and in any case I am satisfied that the Saidmarreh-Kuh-i-Dasht or else the Khasgan gorge route is the easiest that can befound Mention should perhaps be made of a possible route via the eastern h f theAb-i-Diz (through Baznawi), but even were this branch not put out oi court by reason of its greater length, Major Sawyer s verdict is against i . “ The level river bed road, which is said to have passed through this gap, anc traces comparative drawback of being on a 'g . numerous g 0r g e s and Ah-i-Burinird, for instance, the latter mignc, owing ^ n precipitous banks, require greater initial expenses to receive a civilised road or rail. This condemnation applies e^Hy t^b 0 .^ east onheKashgart Acting upon these premises, I first of all examined Vcsult which worked with a view to P finding a suitable alignment ;dissatefied -th thewsu t^ ^ investigate ‘the ^^^^1 Elver, and found a much better align- »hi.sXkX^^^ 1“: plain i recommend the Kaleh-Husainieh alignment therefore, and will proceed to describe its general features. 35. First Section: Fitful (700 f Duhuh (900 feet), 12 miles. A o-entle rise of 20 to 30 feet per mile throughout, increasing slightly near Dukuh. For ttelrst 6 miles, as far as Salilhbad, undulating well-cultivated ^ -E-ated in places. Numerous small irrigation canals near Sahhabad The form t conglomerate, with a thin covering of soil or debris from the d Tano-awan From Salihabad onwards the ground is stony, and the line suggested crosses many small watercourses, dry except immediately after ram, bringing don quantities ot^debrs^en^ j gll0vll( j sayi would pass the ancient tanks known as Do Hauzan, and would enter the low hills at Dukuh, about 3 miles eas o e ^^f-This section may be classed, following Mr. John’s estimate, as “ easy line at 90 000 rupees a-mile for 6 miles, “ surface line” at 50 000 rupees for 6 miles; total 840 000 rupees. Small culverts and revetments will frequently be necessary, balla-t everywhere 1 available; embankments will be expensive where necessary, as there is littl e y soil, the ground being mainly boulders and gravel. Building stone is not availab , bricks will be cheaper and easily available (of squai^ tile shape) in Uiztul. 36. Second Section: Dukuh (900 feet), to KaVeh-i-Riza (1550 feet), 23 miles. (Approximate along proposed Alignment.) Maior Bell (1884), a propos of cart-road construction, remarked of this section that “ the amount of roadmaking to he done, zigzagging in and out of ravines between a few miles south of Kaleh-Husainieh (1,150 feet) and the Bidrubed plain will exceed that m any equal distance between Dizful and Khoremabad. . . . ... P , Between these points the track winds its way amongst intricate hills, ot no great elevation, composed of sandstones topped with a hard conglomerate m piaces; i constantly cresses ravines from 50 to 100 feet in depth. Without a detailed survey o this section it is impossible to suggest any particular alignment, i satisfied myseii, however, by a bird’s-eye view from Bard-i-Balleh and other points, that it canno o * * “ Reconnaissance in Bakhtiari Country, South-West Persia, 1891, Part I, p. 13.circumvented. • Three ravines about 100 feet deep are crossed, and about twenty smaller ones averaging 50 feet. From Bidrubeh onwards to Kafeh Biza (3 miles) the alignment should present no difficulties; by keeping north of the present track, not far from the foot of the limestone hills to the north, there should be no difficulty in obtaining a good though costly alignment of, say, 1 in 75 to 1 in 100. The Bala Bud must be bridged somewhere between Dukuh and Kareh-Husainieh. The average breadth of the ravine in which it runs is about 300 feet at bottom and about 60 feet deep. The whole section will be a difficult and expensive one to survey and to construct. No great difficulty is to be anticipated in regard to the gradient, as the route rises steadily from Dukuh to Kal’eh-Husainieh (1,150 feet), with an average slope of 30 to 40 feet to the mile. No difficulty should be thus experienced in obtaining a gradient of 1 in 100, though heavy cutting and embanking, and bridges of some height, must be looked for throughout. By increasing the ruling gradient to 1 in 50 some saving would no doubt accrue, but it would convert the railway into a switchback, so narrow in section are the ridges to be traversed. I do not think tunnelling could be usefully resorted to at any point. Between Kafeh-Husainieh (1,150 feet) and Kal’eh Biza (1,550 feet), 14 miles, the highest point that the railway would have to traverse is about 1,700 feet, 4 miles from Kal’eh Biza. Cost —Considering the section as a whole, I class it as follows :— Rupees. Medium hilly : 10 miles at 1,25,000 rupees .. .. 12,50,000 Heavy ghat: 7 „ 1,75,000 „ .. .. .. .. 12,25,000 „ 6 „ 2,25,000 „ .. .. .. 13,50,000 Total 38,25,000 37. Third Section : KaVeh Riza (1,550 feet), to Ziarat Ahmad Kuchikeh (1,950 feet), 14 miles. I select Ahmad Kuchikeh as the end of this section because it is a ruling point through which any alignment must pass, being the lowest point of a saddle formed by an extension of the slopes of the Kabir Kuh across the valley; the Saidmarreh Biver forces it way through the obstacle thus placed in its way by a deep gorge, the ravine being some 200 feet higher than the proposed alignment. Between Kal’eh Biza and Pul-i-Tang (9 miles) two alternative alignments present themselves, the first keeps to the northern side of the Kal’eh Biza plain, crosses the Zal just below the point where it enters the plain, near an ancient (probably Sassanian) high level bridge or aqueduct, and keeps to the foot of the gypsum hills, crossing the Ab-i-Tirada and four large ravines till it debouches on to the gentle limestone slopes near Pul-i-Tang. The advantages of this alignment are— 1. It does not descend below 1,350 feet; 2. It is probably 1 mile shorter than the alternative route ; 3. It does not cross the Saidmarreh ; 4. A gradient of 1 in 100 could in all probability be obtained, though at great cost. Its disadvantages are— 1. Not less than six bridges of some size ; 2. Heavy cutting for about 2 miles alternatively with heavy embankments; 3. Awkward curves round gypsum spurs ; 4. Hills traversed between Tirada and Pul-i-Tang are gypsum, which is rapidly corroded by water, and which blasts badly, being of very unequal consistency. The alternative alignment keeps to the south side of the Kal’eh Biza plain, crosses the Saidmarreh at 1,300 feet just below its junction with the Zal and Tirada streams ; continues over the flat stony plain of Sie'h Gilal, and recrosses the Saidmarreh at 9 miles near Pul-i-Tang (1,300 feet). This alignment has the following dis advantages 1. It reaches a level 50 feet lower than the first-mentioned line. 2. It involves two bridges across the Saidmarreh. 3. It involves a gradient of between 1 in 50 and 1 in 75 between Pul-i-Tang (1,300 feet) and Ziarat Ahmad Kuchikeh (1,950 feet), a rise of 450 feet having to be distributed over about 5 miles.

Fourth Section ; Ahmad Kuchikeh (1,950 feet), to Ab-i-Fani (1,500 feet), 15 miles. Ab-i-Fani may be taken as the next ruling point beyond Ahmad Kuchikeh; its height where it joins the Saidmarreh is 1,500 feet, where it issues from the gorge through Kiyalan Kuh 1,700 feet. The distance for railway purposes may be taken as 15 mites. From Ahmad Kuchikeh there is a steady descent down the Jauzar valley till at about 5 miles the Saidmarreh is reached at the point where it enters the long g or |p®’ the south end of which is Pul-i-Tang, height here 1,400 feet; there is therefore a la of 450 feet in 5 miles to be negotiated. If the line be taken along the limestone slopes between the Jauzar stream and the Saidmarreh gorge there will be no difficulty m giving an even gradient, and curvature will be easy, but it will be difficult to geta gradient much better than 1 in 60 ; 1 in 100 could be attained, but at considerable expense, by following the outlines of the foot hills of Kiyalan Kuh, only touching the 1,400 feet level near the Lailum stream, but the curves will be awkward, the length of line probably 1 mile at least greater, and tbe work difficult and expensive. As 1 in 50 will be unavoidable in subsequent sections, I propose the former alignment, it passes over gentle limestone slopes with no difficult features such as spuis or ravines. ^ ,i The next 5 miles to the Ab-i-Lailum lie along the Saidmarreh valley, near t river. The Lailum stream can be crossed half-a-mile above its junction with the Height of the stream here 1,500 feet, banks 50 feet higher; width from bank to ban300 feet; fordable ; rocky bottom; width of stream average 200 feet; water slightly bitter, not over 1 ft. 6 in. deep in summer. From Lailum to the Fani stream, 5 miles, the best alignment seems to be close to the river ; easy throughout, except at 15 miles, where there is an awkward sput abutting on the Saidmarreh : it would involve heavy cutting. As regards cost, I think this section may fairly be classed as follows :— Easy : 5 miles at 1,25,000 rupees .. Medium hilly in rock : 8 miles at 1,50,000 rupees Heavy ghat line: 2 miles at 1,75,000 rupees.. Rupees. 6.25.000 12 , 00,000 3.50.000 Total .. 21,75,000 39. We have now reached the point where the alignments respectively east and west of the Kasbgan River, commence to diverge. I went over the eastern alignment via Dalich and Dadabad with care, surveying it throughout. As, however, I rejected it in favour of a line along or west of the Kashgan, it seems unnecessary to trouble Government with a detailed description of it.* I will therefore confine myself to an abstract of the length and cost of this line, as estimated by me :— Miles.

(average over 12,000£. a-mile). Railway gradient 1 in 50. Curvature difficult: 200 yards radius the best that can be hoped for in many places. 40. The Madian Bud Alignment, West of the Kashgan. I will now proceed to describe the alternative alignment west of the Kashgan River, to wich I turned my attention as soon as I had reached Khoremabad by the route described above. It diverges from the alignment first described at the end of the fourth section, the totals up to this point being 64 miles, costing 88,65,000 rupees. Before describing this section, I may remark that a gorge line up the Kashgan to Dureh is probably practicable, but I have not been able to go fully into the question as the Kashgan was not fordable, and the track which runs up the Kashgan valley crosses the river constantly. An alignment up the gorge, as far as I can make out, after examining it for 6 miles above Pul-i-Kurr to Dukhtar, and at Tang-i-Tir, and near Pul-i-Kalhur would be a very expensive gorge line, with fifteen or twenty bridges of 100 feet or so each over the Kashgan. We may estimate the cost at 3 lakhs a mile for 60 miles =180 lakhs. This compares rather unfavourably with the Culgul Madian Rud alignment described below, but the possibility is well worth careful examination when the time comes. This alignment is dealt with in paragraph 46. 41. Fifth Section: Ab-i-Fani (1,400 feet) &gt; to Mouth of ^ Tung-i-Khiradarr (2,100 feet), 20 miles. (Approximately by Alignment along Saidmarreh and Kashgan Bivers to Jaidar.) This will be a difficult and expensive section: gradient on the average eapy, not more than 1 in 75. The line would follow the general line of the Saidmarreh River to where it is joined by the Kashgan, below Pul Gamishan ; thence up the Kashgan valley to the mouth of the Tang-i-Khirsdarr, within which lies the ruins of a splendid Sassanian bridge, known as the Pul Kurr o Dukhtar or Pul Shapur. I think I shall * The detailed notes of this alignment are on record in the Bushire residency.24 fce within the mark if I class it as “heavy ghat” at If lakhs of rupees a-mile for 20 milea - Rupees.

Sixth Section: Mouth of Tang-i-Khirsdarr (2,100 feet), to top of Tang-i-hillehdar, on Rumishgan Plain (4,100 feet), 19 miles. This will be the most difficult piece on this alignment, for it is here that we ascend on to the Luristan plateau, a rise of 2,000 feet in 19 miles. 1 ~ The Tang-i-Khirsdarr is accessible from the south, it may be noted, only on foot, unless the Kashgan is fordable. ., mu There is a&gt;ssibility that the alignment for a metre-gauge railway would be easier up the Tang-i-Khiisdarr and the Pam Pans valley than via Millehdar, as now described.^ &amp; separate report regard j ng the suitability of the former ahgnme^for^cart ^ a]ong the s]opes of Kuh Maleh, rising steadily on a gradient of about 1 in 50. This hill is a saddle back ; slope of rock on southein side 15 to 20 degrees ; formation very hard limestone; face of hill but little furrowed by water-courses, and contour lines very straight. The track will have to be made by blasting and revetting the whole way. I shall I hone, be on the safe side m allowing 2 lakhs a-mile for this section. ? r ’ Knpees.

Seventh Section: Top of Tung Millehdar to Kuh-i Dasht Plain. This section traverses four low ranges of hills; the first range Daghilleh-Sidann is pierced by the Yang Jangir, through which the alignment proposed passes; the second range Madian Kuh is skirted to the east, and crossed at its lowest point about 4,500 feet. The third range K. Astan-Kalkhani is similarly circumvented at about 5,000 feet. The fourth range is pierced by the Tang Haleh and by the Madian Bud (4,150 feet at the bridge); but it will probably be cheaper to take the line via Gulgul, and pierce the fourth range by a tunnel of J mile at the north end of the Kuh Dasht plain near Chasmeh Kamir; the height of the range here is 4,700 feet, that of the spring about 4,500 feet. There is no use my suggesting any particular alignment: several alternatives readily suggest themselves to anyone on the spot. I estimate the distance that would have to be covered by the line in order to reach the south edge of the Kuh-i-Dasht plain at 20 miles of which 10 miles easy at 75,000 a-mile and 10 miles at 1^- lakhs, as a good deal of blasting will be required.

Eighth Section: Kuh-i-Dasht Plain (4,500 feet), to Kashgan (3,650 feet), 35 miles. In this section we have to traverse or circumvent the Kuh-i-Guraz range, 6,000 feet high. It has a breadth of over 4 miles, and tunnelling is scarcely practicable; it can, however, be circumvented to a large extent by skirting it eastward towards the Kashgan. This involves a rise to about 5,800 feet, and thence a steady fall can be provided to the Kashgan, which would be crossed probably not far from the bridge at 8,690 feet. The anarchical conditions prevailing prevented me from examining the whole of the alignment, but I am satisfied that it is practicable.Distance .—Difficult to estimate, as owing to haze I was unable to triangulate satisfactorily. Across Kuh-i-Dasht Plain, 8 miles; rising from 4,300 feet to 4,700 feet skirting south slopes Kuh-i-Guraz to east to near Kashgan 12 miles; from 4,700 feet to 5,000 feet, and thence, downwards, round east end of Kuh-i-Guraz to near Tang-i-Tir, 8 miles, and another 7 miles to some point near Pul-i-Kashgan; total 35 miles. Cost .-—The first 8 miles may be classed as “easy” at 75,000 rupees a-mile ; the remaining 27 may be put down at not less than lakhs a mile :— Kupees. 8 miles at 75,000 rupees ., .. .. .. .. 6,00,000 17 miles at 1-^ lakhs .. .. .. .. .. .. 40,50,000 Bridge across Kashgan (say) .. .. .. .. .. 1,50,000 Grand total for 158 miles .. .. .. 2,31,15,000 The last 15 miles are along rocky slopes mainly of fairly stiff shale, but with a good deal of very hard limestone in places, and heavy cuttings through the smaller spurs. It should be possible to adopt a gradient not steeper than 1 in 75. 45, Ninth Section : Kashgan (3,650 feet), to Khoremabad (4,400 feet), 21 miles. The alignment would follow the Kashgan Piver to its junction with the Ab-i- Khoremabad, and then follow the general trend of the latter stream to the town. Various alternatives will doubtless suggest themselves when a proper survey is made, but the general alignment will remain the same. This section will present no difficulty ; the last 10 miles would be “surface” line, were it not for the numerous small bridges and culverts that will have to be constructed, and a slight embankment will be necessary to keep the slope even from terrace to terrace. The first 17 miles will be difficult to align, but should not be very expensive to construct, the hills being mainly of alluvium or shale with a little limestone.

The Kashgan Gorge Alignment (vide paragraph 40). I will now turn to another alignment, up the gorge of the Kashgan Piver from its entrance to the Jaidar Plain at Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar to its exit from the Khoremabad Plain at Tang-i-Tir about 40 miles north. I had contemplated traversing this gorge or valley from end to end; unfortunately, however, owing to the unprecedented snow of this year, and a late season, the river was in full flood and quite unfordable. As the track up the valley crosses the river thirty or forty times it was impossible for me to get up the gorge, and I had to content myself by seeing what I could of it at intervals. The river winds amongst steep hills, generally ending in cliffs abutting on the bed; a big bend occurs about every 2 miles, when the river will be running on one bank or the other up against a cliff; it is then necessary to cross to the other bank which is usually flat terrace ; there is no clear view of the valley for more than three or four miles, and at several points the cliffs on both sides run down to the water, leaving only a difficult mule track which is covered when the river is in flood. At such points heavy rock cutting, revetting, and tunnelling will be necessary. The river must be constantly crossed, involving numerous bridges. The average breadth of the river when it is not spread over the gravels, or divided into several branches, is about 200 feet: 300 feet would have to be provided as a rule, from abutment to abutment to provide for flood water. The river is liable to heavy floods, a rise of 15 feet being not unknown ; the bed uniformly gravelly; no reefs or falls as far as I know. The valley is narrow, but there is always a fairly wide stretch of river terraces on one bank or the other. Difficult as the construction of a railway up such a valley would be, the alignment is a not unattractive one. It would be possible to have an almost even slope from the Saidmarreh to Khoremabad, and the ruling gradient would probably not exceed 1 in [2150 4] H26 100 at any point. Steel trestle bridges of stock size might be used to cross the stream and would, if I may presume to offer an opinion on such a technical point, be well suited to the country and conditious of labour and construction. • t* + 47. To estimate the cost of this gorge line, the length of which, from Tang-i-T o Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar, may be taken at 40 miles, is of course quite beyond me even ad I been able to traverse it from end to end. I am assured however on the authority of the Sardar Akram and others, the general accuracy of whose statements ee ^ able to check, that a mule track exists right up the gorge, and that at no poi t t contract to such an extent as to form an impassable canyon. 1 i , f oneniol Allowing 3 lakhs a-mile for the line, including bridges, and 25 lakhs for special tunnelling (which would seem, all things considered, to be a liberal allowance) or e northern and southern ends of this valfey, which I have traversed, and the centre, which I have seen from a short distance, offer no formidable obstacles to radway constiuc ion we obtain a total of 180 lakhs. The total cost of this alignment would thus be as follows :— Sections 1 to 5, 84 miles at 65,000 rupees .. Kashgan gorge, 40 miles .. Tang-i-Tir Khoremabad, 16 miles Grand total for 120 miles Rupees. 1.23.65.000 1,45,00,000 12 , 00,000 2.80.65.000 (= 1.871.000/., or 15,600/. a-mile.) 48. The difference between the cost of this alignment and that via Madian is 171,000Z., according to this estimate, which is a mere guess ; the savmg of length is no less than 65 miles, about one quarter of the distance between Dizful and Burujird ; the absence of steep gradients is an added advantage. # tit m Had I seen any chance of being able to examine this valley more closely, 1 wou have waited for another month or two in order to do so, but the Sardar Axram, who alone could arrange for my safe conduct along this line, left for the Kermanshah district to revenge the murder of a friend of his, by plundering the guilty tribe, and simu a- neously hostilities commenced between the Bairanwand and the Governor-General, making any further stay in the neighbourhood, out of the question. I think it not improbable that this alignment may turn out very little more, perhaps less, expensive than that via Kuh-i-Dasht, and I would recommend that any engineer expert who may subsequently be deputed to prepare authoritative estimates and effect a regular and detailed survey of an alignment should first examine the Kashgan gorge; in order to do so, he must make his survey between June and November (the floods this year being quite abnormal), and must arrange with the Sardar Akram (whose head-quarters are at Tarhan), to provide the necessary escort which he will, no doubt, gladly do. In any case the saving in length by this route may be considered to justify some extra expenditure. Part IV.— Possible Extensions of Alignment from Khoremabad Northwards. 49. Possible Pi'olongation of Line from Khoremabad onwards. The easiest prolongation would undoubtedly be towards Kermanshah, distant rather more than 100 miles; the country traversed is well fitted, for a railway alignment which would run parallel to the mountain ranges which run in a north-north west direction throughout Luristan. But such prolongation would be of little use towards developing British trade in Central Persia, and I assume that the^prolongation contemplated is to Burujird and thence to Tehran via Hamadan or via Sultanabad and Kum. The boundary between the Russian sphere of influence and the neutral zone in this region is “ a line starting from Kasr-i-Shirin, passing through Ispahan. . ... Kermanshah and Burujird are thus included in the region in which Great Britain engaged not to seek concessions “for railways, land, telegraphs, road, transport, insurance, &amp;c.,” though all concessions which existed in the region in question on the 31st August, 1907, are maintained.27 The boundary line is roughly equidistant between Khoremabad and Burujird. A prolongation by rail or motor beyond Khoremabad would presumably be possible only with the consent of the Russian Government, who, it has been suggested, are likely eventually to view the project with hostility. Without such a prolongation, at all events as far as Burujird, the utility of the line would be greatly impaired, and the volume of exports in particular would be of quite insignificant proportions. Khoremabad is a very bad distributing centre ; the local market is negligible ; the surrounding country disturbed ; traffic on the main road to Burujird greatly impeded by snow in winter; and I feel convinced that any attempt to make the town into a railway terminus will be predoomed to failure, and trade will stick to the route via Bagdad, in which town are many wholesale dealers from whom small buyers can order direct. The only practical alignment between Khoremabad and Burujird is that via Zagheh, which I will now proceed to describe in detail. 50. First Section: Khoremabad to Foot of Zagheh Pass (6,300 feet), 21 miles. A steady climb along a stream which runs from the foot of the Zagheh pass all the way to Khoremabad. A gradient of 1 in 50 is the best that can be obtained, and it is possible that at one or two points 1 in 40 may be necessary for short distances. There is little heavy blasting, but for the first 10 miles there will be about 3 miles of blasting on the side of the hills, which are composed of limestone strata, covered in places by alluvial gravels and clay. The passage of the Tang-i-Zaideh Shir will involve some heavy cutting or embanking in order to reduce the gradient, so also will the ascent from the Tajareh to the Deh Saficl plain. The Darreh Daraz valley once entered, the gradient becomes easier, and the line will be cheaper to construct; it would no doubt skirt the north side of the valley, rising steadily as far as is compatible with the maintenance of the ruling gradient. I estimate the cost at 1^- lakhs a mile — 3^- lakhs. 51. Zagheh Tunnel. The Zagheh pass (7,200 feet) now confronts us ; apart from the practical difficulty of carrying a railway up its steep rocky slopes and over its narrow crest, such a course would involve a long detour. There is no way of circumventing the range, and I think there is no doubt but that it must be tunnelled ; from 5,600 feet on the south-western to 6,500 feet on the northern side is, as nearly as I can judge, 1|- miles through limestone rock ; water is plentiful. I have no means of estimating the cost with any approach to accuracy, but for the purposes of this report it may be put down at 50 lakhs. 52. Second Section: Across the Hu-Rnd Valley from near Zagheh (6,500 feet), to above Rang-i-liazan (6,800 feet), 15 miles. From Zagheh the alignment winds down the valley of the Zagheh stream till it can turn north-east and skirt the south side of the Rud valley, crossing the stream at about 6,000 feet. It would then turn north-west and approach Rang-i-Razan village, 6,580 feet, then circle round the village and skirt the slopes of Ruh Chavireh Shah in a west-south-westerly direction, rising steadily to about 6,800 feet, when the hill narrows sufficiently to make a tunnel, in all probability, economical. There is no break in the Chavireh Shah range, which the Zagheh-Razan road crosses at 7,200 feet, and the descent on the northern side to the Silakhor plain will be much more difficult from 7,200 feet than from 6,700 feet, the height at which I propose the northern exit of the tunnel should be fixed. I estimate this section to be 15 miles long, costing lakhs a mile = 18f lakhs. 53. Kazan Tunnel. I estimate this to be 2,000 yards long; formation limestone rock ; water plentif 1 . It might enter the hill on the south side at 6,800 feet, and emergent 6,700 feet into the Razan valley. Cost may be put down afc 30 lakhs. I see noway of dispensing with it; the pass cannot be avoided, and if the railway be carried over it to 7,200 feet, the drop of 1,500 feet to the Silakhor valley will be prohibitively steep. [2150 z—l] I5-1. Third Section: Kazan (6,700 feet), Head of Tunnel to Silakhor Plain (o,i00 feet), 10 miles. If the month on the Kazan aide be fixed at 6,700 feet, the drop ^ The actual distance between the mouth of the tunnel and the foot ot the g leSS Th^ • W the Kazan valley are, on the whole of a the construction of a railway along them, h |lt ' ,, care ful survey valley should be selected, is a point which can be settled after a c d My impression is that it will be best to take the line into stead ly on a thence skirt the hills bounding the Silakhor-plam to the west descending stead y gradient of 1 in 50 till the plain is reached at approxima e y &gt; , j. en n;neering g This section will call for most careful surveys, and a high degree ^ skill.

Miles Approximately. From Burujird to— Kangavar Kermanshah Hamadan Tehran Ispahan Kum Kasvin Enzeli ro 126 70 270 210 160 150 9SS£9 59. A Burujird-Kangavar railway could be constructed at an average cost of about 5,000b a-mile for 80 miles, say 800,000b ; it would connect with the Bagdad- Kermanshah-Hamadan-Tehran line. The ruling gradient would be about 1 in 150. It would pass for the whole of its length through thickly populated highly cultivated . country,'' - and would be a most efficient feeder line. A cart-road with a ruling gradient * of 1 in 25 could be built along the same alignment for about 3,000b, the principal expense being caravanserais (six), bridges, and culverts. 60. Potentialities of the Burujird District. Minerals .—I obtained information regarding several mines reported to exist near Burujird. Gold was said to be found in one mine, and I was given a sample of the same,t which I believe, however, to be simply micaceous sand. Lead ore was said to be found in remunerative quantities, 5 farsakhs distant, the ore yields 25 per cent, of metal ; the sample I was shown seemed of very good quality.! I was told at Nihawand that a European mining expert had said that the hills of this town contained good grade copper ore, but I had no opportunity of confirming this. I was told of a place west of Burujird, called Fial, where good quality coal-beds were exposed ; the sample shown me was bituminous ; it burnt wellx but has, I should say, no commercial value. I was told that petroleum oil was found in the locality, and had been collected and burnt in lamps Geologically, the distinguishing feature of the country immediately north and north-west of Burujird is that the limestone formation gives place to much c ntorted finely laminated shales, extensively mixed with veins of intrusive rocks; the formation would thus seem to be very favourable to the existence of metalliferous ores. At Khoremabad I was shown specimen of bituminous coal from the Papi country east of that town, of iron pyrites from the same locality, and of copper sulphate (zak or zagh), but these minerals occur apparently in small quantities only on the surface, and only the last-named (which is used for dyeing) is worked at all. Agricultural Produce .—Cereals : Mainly consumed locally, or exported to other parts of Persia. Opium : Mainly consumed in Persia ; some 30,000b exported. Gums, dried fruits (raisins, &amp;c.) : Steady export to Bussia, which would be diverted to south by railway. Cotton, wool : Steady export to Bussia, which would be diverted to south by Part V. —Possible Alignment for a Cart-road from Dizful to Burujird. 61. I have in the previous pages suggested the possibility of a cart-road between Dizful and Burujird being preferable to a railway. For such a cart-road the Persian Transport Company holds a concession, which will expire in May 1913, unless the road is opened before that date. The one formidable obstacle which prevents it being built at once is the prevailing anarchy in Luristan ; the Amir Mufakham has, however, made a determined effort to open the road, I have little doubt that the fact of the road, being in existence, and the pressure that we could exert on the Persian Government to keep it open, would ensure eventual success. I have submitted a separate report on this subject, and will confine myself here to state briefly the alignment which I propose. 62. From Dizful to Jaidar the road would follow the general alignment proposed for the railway, caravanserais being erected at the marginally noted spots.! ^ I rom the Jaidar Plain through the Tang-i-Khirsdarr across the Kashgan to^ Pul, Maidan Bud, this is the main ascent of the route, and the most expensive section, as the Kashgan must be bridged, and an entrance to the gorge blasted. I went over this route and found it well suited for a cart track, the gradients being generally moderate (1 in 25), and the expense of grading the steep portions small. From Madian Bud to Khoremabad via Chinar, Bardaghul, Dureh, and Naikash; this section was considered by Major Burton to be fit in its present condition for wheeled artillery, and it could certainly be converted into a cart-road at moderate expense. Caravanserais necessary * * Silakhor Bala, ISihavand, and Kermanshah districts, t Deposited in the Bushire residency, f Kal’eh Husainieh, Kal’eh Riza, Jaozar, Ab-i-Fani, Jaidar.30 at Ali Gijan, Madian End Chinar, Bardaghul, Dureh, and Changai would again have to be rebridged near Dureh and the Khoremabad river below the town. From Khoremabad to Burujird via Zagheh and Kazan is always practicable for wheels, and little expense would be incurred except on the section between Kazan and the Silakhor va ll e y This route is about 220 miles long, and I have divided it into thirteen stages; Jft it is said to have been used in past times by Persian artillery ; it was traversed by * De Bode 1835 and Schindler 1889, and was undoubtedly a main artery of trade in Sassanian times, witness the great bridge of Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar in the Tang-i- Khirsdarr. * I am satisfied it is the shortest practicable cart-road. The experience of the road company in South Persia is, I believe, that it does not pay to carry merchandise in carts as a rule, pack animals being cheaper. It is possible therefore that a 183 miles pack mule road from Dizful to Burujird in the Kiyalan would be of greater assistance to our trade than a 217 mile cart track, which involves greater expense and a larger staff along the road; but it may be held also that under the concession the construction of a cart-road is obligatory, the phrase “ route chaussee ” being used in the title, though nowhere else, according to the English translation in my possession. It should also be borne in mind that where ordinary carts might not pay, motor traffic would perhaps do so ; the employment of a Kenard train has recently been advocated on the Bondar Abbas-Kerman road for instance. Further that the transport company has hitherto found itself quite unable to arrange for a sufficient supply of mules on the road in which they are interested ; a mule road, unless well organised, would not serve the purpose of distributing British goods into the present Prussian zone, which is served by a well-organised cart-road from Rasht to Hamadan.

Pol. 3990a/10. Report of 1872. Select Committee, 22nd July (No. 322.) 1. 1 he preparation of this Memorandum was s^S^sted by the submission by a Russian “ Con sortium of a scheme for the connection of the European and Indian railway systems by a line across Persia.'-' There are, however, other railways m Persia of which the construction, or “ ear marking ” has been or may shortly have to be considered. 1 he Memorandum, therefore, deals with 4 ersian railways generally. The early history of Persian railway projects has special interest at the present moment, since with the expiry in 1910 of the Russian prohibition of railway construction in Persia the position has reverted to some extent to what it was before the end of 1890 when that prohibition took formal and definite shape (see paragraph 10 below). 4 he idea, it may be mentioned, of railway connection with India by way of Persia is very old. 1 he Select Committee of the House of Commons that reported in 1872 on the Euphrates Valley Railway mentioned the idea only to reject it:— “ As regards the terminus on the Persian Gulf, “ your Committee are decidedly of opinion that it “ would be better to carry the line to some point where it might be brought into communication “ with the steam vessels which are now under “ Government subvention to carry the mails, and “ which ply from the Indian ports to Basra, than “ to continue it along the coast to Karachi by a “ very expensive, and probably unremunerative “ route.” The Reuter and other early Con cessions. t For an account of the Reuter Con cession, see Lord Curzon’s “ Persia,” 1892, Vol. I., p p . 480-483. 2. Although there had been other concessions for railways in Persia, the first of which mention need be made is that embodied in the Reuter Concession of 1872, a concession which, besides surrendering into foreign hands the entire indus trial resources of the country, conferred upon Baron de Reuter for the space of 70 yearsj* an absolute S. 47. A“ 1887 ).” 2 monopoly of railway and tramway construction m Persia. The concession was impracticable, and it was afterwards revoked. There followed the Falckenhagen Concession in 1874-75 for a line from Julfa to Tabriz, the Alleon Concession in 1878 for a line from Resht to Teheran, a plan for an American Concession, an one for an English Concession for a line to Teheran from the Upper Karun. In 1882 a M. Boital obtained a oroup of railway concessions which resulted m the opening in 1888 of a railway about six nines long from Teheran to the shrine of Shah Abdul Azim. A second railway, about 12 miles long, from Mahmudabad on the Caspian to the town of Amol, was later constructed by native enterprise, but this railway iell into disuse, and the insigni ficant Shah Abdul Azim railway is the only railway that Persia now possesses. * 3. A few years later a Russian named Palash kovskv had plans for joining the Trans-Caucasian Railway with Tehran,'' and at the beginning oi 1888 a draft concession was under discussion between the British and Persian Governments for a railway in the south from Mohanmierah to Tehran, f A line from Tehran to Bagdad via Keimansha i was also spoken of, but no progress was made towards railway construction m Persia, and the year 1888 was marked by acute rivalry between Great Britain and Russia. The position of Great Britain is clear from the instructions given m September to Sir 11. Drummond W olff, the Butish Minister, to the elfect that he could not impress too strongly on the Shah that the only means of enabling us to give him effectual suppoit was to improve means of communication with the Persian Gulf. The Shah, however, in the previous year, had given an undertaking to Prince Dolgoiouki, the Russian Minister at 'Tehran, in the following terms :— Shah’s Agreement of 1887 with Russia. British assurances to Shah of 24th October 1888, leading to opening of the Karun. * See Mr. Michell’s memorandum en closed m Sir R. Morier s Despatch T\o. 41, 6th February 1S89.

The position of Her Majesty’s Government was greatly complicated by this undertaking, and, in the end, after lengthy negotiations, an assurance was given on the 24th October 1888, by Sir H. Drummond Wolff to the Amin-es-Sultan, with the approval of Her Majesty’s Government, to the following effect:— “ In the event of any Power making an attack without just cause or provocation on Persia, or attempting to take possession of Persian territory against the will of the Persian Government, Her Majesty’s Government engage to make earnest representations against such proceedings, and to take such steps as may in their judgment be best calculated to prevent any infringement of the “ integrity of Persia. “ It is understood that, in order to enable Her “ Majesty’s Government to carry out this engage ment, the Persian Government will give Her Majesty’s Government immediate notice of any demand threatening to the integrity of Persia which may be made upon them by any foreign “ Power.” The river Karun was then declared by the Shah to be open to the navigation of all countries. Mr. Clergue’s railway from Alexan- dretta to India. Russian projects for railways in North Persia, and from Caspian to Persian Gulf. Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 5, 13th January 1889. (P. 59.) Lord Salisbury’s Telegram No. 17, dated 4th February 1889. (P. 38.) • Memorandum of Intelligence Depart ment, 7th March 1889. (P. 185.) 4. The next year (1889) was marked by the discussion of various more or less inchoate proposals for railways in Persia, among them one by an American, Mr. Clergue, as to whom Sir H. D. Wolff reported in January in the following terms :— “ Mr. Clergue’s wish is to make a line from “ Alexandretta by Bagdad and Dizful to Tehran “ with a branch to Mohammerah, and to continue “ it later to join the Indian system by such a route “ as the Indian Government might select. A direct “ line would thus be found from the Mediterranean “ to the Persian Gulf and to India. He estimates “ the cost of the proposed railways at 6,000b a “ mile.” There was also some apprehension as to Russian projects in the north of Persia, and on the 4th February 1889 Lord Salisbury instructed Sir H. D. Wolff that “ broadly speaking, the eastern districts “ of Khorasan are the highway for Russian flank “ attack on Afghanistan, and we should do our best “ to prevent Russian advances in this direction.” On the 7th March 188 ( J, the Intelli gence Department of the War Office examined in a memorandum, under the four heads of (1) practi cability, (2) cost, (3) commercial value, and (4) military value, the projects above referred to, including lines from Askhabad to Meshed, and Sarakhs to Nasirabad, and in forwarding the memorandum to the Foreign Office, Sir H. Bracken- bury, the Director of Military Intelligence, made the following observations :— “ There is one point which I wish to emphasize. “ Khorasan is not only the base from which serious “ operations against India will be undertaken, if A 2“ ever they should be attempted, but its possession “ is essential to Russia even for sustained opera- “ tions in Western Afghanistan. This is clearly “ set forth in important Russian secret official “ papers. “ Even if we admit that sooner or later Khorasan “ must become a Russian province, and that Herat “ and Northern Afghanistan must fall to Russia, it “ is desirable to postpone the evil day as long as “ possible. Nothing would so hasten its arrival as “ the construction of such raihvays as are here “ contemplated, and nothing would so greatly add “ to Russia’s power for still further advance. “ The absorption of Khorasan into the Russian “ Empire, or even its control by means of railways “ in Russian hands, will compel India to add to her “ already heavy military burdens.” On the 15th March a further memorandum was prepared by the Intelligence Department on a projected Russian line of railway either from Resht or Baku, through Tehran, Kashan, 'l ezd, Kerman, and Bampur, to Charbar on the Persian Gulf. It was pointed out that, possessed of this line and established in Khorasan, Russia would control the whole of the Persian kingdom, and gain a position on the Indian Ocean that would necessitate an increase of British naval forces in Indian waters, and add to our already heavy burdens “ To sum “ up, the cost of the enterprise is very large, but ‘‘ the commercial results to be ultimately obtained “ (i.e. by Russia) may possibly be worth the outlay, “ while the strategical position to be attained, “ owing to the additional menace which it would “ involve to our position in North-Western India, “ might possibly be deemed sufficient to justify so “ large an undertaking.” 5. On the 20th March 1889 Sir H. !). Wolff forwarded the following important engagement^ given by the Shah with respect to railways m Persia, and with special relation to those in the south:— The Shah to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. “ (Translation). “ His Excellency the Minister for Foreign “ Affairs. “ Of His Excellency Wolff tbe English Minister “ Plenipotentiary ' and Envoy Extraordinary’s “ communications, information has been received, “ and it has caused much astonishment. “ Convey these commands to His Excellency “ the Minister Plenipotentiary. Even give him this “ very autograph, in order that he may keep it and “ be satisfied that our former promisef with regard “ to the priority of the English Government over “ others in the construction of a southern railway “ to Tehran continues to hold good ; and, certainly, “ whenever railway concessions in the north, &amp;c., “ are given to others, immediately a Concession for “ a railway from Tehran to Shuster, or such a one, Memorandum of Intelligence Depart ment, 15th March 1889.

' “ Hated Ibth September 1888.* u ... ^ 11( ^ 18 clear that in Persia nobody W1 ^ granted permission to construct railways, t{ exce Pt it be solely commercial ones. We say so ‘ now that they may know it.” In subsequent despatches Sir 11 . D. Wolff in formed the Foreign Office of the conclusion of an .agreement between the Shah and the Russian Covernment, the concluding portion of which ran as follows :— « , ‘ b Iffi e Persian Government accepts that it should grant to a Russian Company the con struction in Persia of railways to anywhere u wh.eie it may be advantageous to the commercial “ interests of both Governments, and the conditions of the Act of f oncession are to be suitable and to the satisfaction of both parties, and for the discussion of this question the aforesaid Company &lt; granted five years grace, within which period of five years no other company shall be granted permission to construct railways. After the ex piration of this term, or the signature of the Concession, the Persian Government is at liberty to grant permission to any Company to construct railways in any direction. If during these five years Russian companies do not wish to construct railways, the Persian Government is entirely “ freed from this its promise and agreement. “ Hi view of the acceptance of the aforesaid matters, the promise and agreement given to His Majesty the Emperor on the 14th Zi Hejjeh 1304,* concerning waters and railways, is cancelled (literally, loses its credit.)

Morier’s Telegram No. 2, 2nd January 1890. (P. 1.) 6 . On the And January 1890 Sir R. Morier telegraphed from St. Petersburg that a Commission presided over by M. A baza had been appointed to examine the scheme of a Syndicate largely sup ported by Russian capitalists, as well as by Germans and other foreigners, to construct a railway from Resht to Tehran, and on to the Persian Gulf. A 3m s' B Lord Salisbury thereupon suggested to So II. • Wolff that “ it might be the best course not “ oppose this scheme altogether, but to insist that “ it should be an international one, in which h English capitalists should have a share, that the “Company should be domiciled in Persia and “ subject to Persian law, ^and all security taken against differential rates.” A few days later Sir H. D. Wolff became pos sessed of a draft concession presented to the 1 ersian Government by Russian applicants, the result o which would have been a practical monopoly to such applicants of all railways in Persia. On instruc tions from Lord Salisbury the following note was, thereupon, presented to the Persian Govern- ment:— Lord Salisbury’s Telegram No. 3, 3rd January 1890. (r. *)■ Sir H. D. Wolff's Telegram No. 32, 1st February 1890. (P. 26.) Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 35, 5th February 1890. (P. 49.) M. le Ministre, 1st February 1890. “ As it is generally reported that appnea- tions are being addressed by foreign contrac tors to His Majesty the Shah for concessions of railways in Persia, I venture to recall to the recollection of Your Excellency the gracious promise contained in the autograph ot His Maiesty the Shah, dated the 10th March. by this document His Majesty was pleased to convey to me the solemn assurance : “ 1. That whenever a railway concession may be given anywhere in Persia, a similar concession shall he granted to an English Company lor a line from Tehran to the Persian Cult. “ 2. That no concession of any kind will be given for a railway from Tehran to the south except m agreement with this Eegation. “ Her Majesty’s Government have charged me to remind Your Excellency of these engagements merely with the view of avoiding the possibility of any conflict of interests which may be caused by the applications at present submitted to liis ■ Majesty by others.” Si ?tli A * See paragraph 5. 7 . About this time Sir H. D. Wolff laid stress on the great hardship under which the trade of Persia laboured from the cost and difficulty of transport, and he expressed the belief that a line through Enzeli, Tehran, and Mohammerah, com bined with sea-transport from Mohammerah to Karachi, would prove of the greatest commercial advantage to Russia, Persia, and India. He advo cated an understanding between Russia, the bnan, and Great Britain under three heads : - “1. A declaration that the railway is to be “ considered neutral, much on the same lines as the “ neutrality of the Suez Canal. “ 2. The railway to he made under a Persian « charter by an International Company in which the “ three Governments should be officially represented. “ 3 . The ‘ Cahier des Charges ’ to be approved “ by the three Governments.” Advocacy by Sir H. D. Wolff of a railway from the Caspian to Moham- merah. Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 49, 14th February 1890. (P. 59.) (P. 61.)15 He considered that a minimum guarantee of 4 per cent, might be provided by (1) the increase of the Customs consequent on the new traffic, ( 2 ) a low transit due to be raised per ton on all goods going through the country by the line, and his despatch concluded with the following words :— ^ ^ ( 1 cannot help thinking that the formation of “ ^e Committee in Russia is a proof of the desire “ of the commercial classes in that country to avail themselves of trade routes which cannot be overlooked. “ The Government of Russia might perhaps be persuaded to see the advantages to be derived from this line of railway, which would be very “ great on her side, and the course to be taken “ would be such as to preclude the idea of stra tegical rather than trade purposes.” Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 261, In a subsequent despatch Sir H D Wolff 8th August 1890. forwarded a report by Mr. Macqueen, Civil Engineer, on the suggested railway between Enzeli and Mohammerah. Views of Her Majesty’s Government as to Russian Railways in Persia. Sir H. D. Wolff’s Despatch No. 137, 21st April 1890. (P. 45.) Lord Salisbury’s Telegram, 19th May 1890. (P. 51.) 8 . In April of the same year a report was made by Sir 14. D. Wolff to the effect that the Abaza Committee were said to have in contemplation a line from Tiflis to Tabriz, Tehran, and Bunder Abbas. On the 19th May the views of Her Majesty’s Government were explained to him in a comprehensive telegram of which the following is a paraphrase:— “ With reference to your despatches and other “ correspondence on the subject of railway con- “ cessions in Persia, there are three possible “ contingencies to be considered : — “ In the first place, it is by no means improbable “ that the Russians will attempt to construct a line “ passing through Khorasan in the direction of “ Herat. They may employ Government funds “ upon such an enterprise. In this case 1 can only “ instruct you to offer the most strenous resistance, “ although I feel some doubt as to whether you will “ succeed. “ Another line which the Russians may wish to “ make is that from their own frontier to the Persian capital. It is not necessary that you “ should oppose it, but merely insist that a similar “ concession should be granted to us in the south, “ which should correspond in value and importance “ with the Russian line, and should be decided on “ in consultation with Her Majesty’s Legation. “ The Russian Government would hardly be willing “ to defray the expense of construction in this “ instance, and it is very doubtful whether the “ money could be raised in other quarters. “ There remains, as the third contingency, the “ line which you have mentioned, running across “ Persia from the Caspian to Bunder Abbas on the “ Persian Gulf. 1 feel certain that the Russian “ Government would not devote public funds to “ the construction of such a line; it would be A 48 “ necessary to have recourse to foreign capitalists, “ and the success of an appeal to the public market “ would entirely depend on the attitude of Englanc “ towards the enterprise. If Her Majesty’s Govern- u m ent were to announce that the constiuction o “ this railway would be regarded as an act of “ hostility towards Ed gland, and that they would not “ undertake, in the case of any future disturbances, “ to respect the property of the shareholdei s, or ol “ any one connected with the line, it would be “ impossible to raise the necessary capital on any “ Stock Exchange in Europe. “ For the present, at all events, it is better to “ maintain a defensive attitude in regard to all “ projects of railway construction. Personally 1 “ I cannot think that we shall be called upon to “ decide as to the line of railway to be undei taken “ in Southern Persia until the Indian Government “ have extended their line from Chaman through “Baluchistan and Seistan. I here ^ is, I believe, “ much divergence of opinion at Calcutta on this “ particular question ; but when once the Indian “ fine is in working order up to Chaman, I leel “ convinced tliat, in spite oi the reluctance now “ expressed, the Government ot India will feel it “ impossible to stop at that point, and will be “ obliged to face the necessity ot a fuithei “ extension. “ It seems scarcely probable that lor some tune “ to come any line will be made from the Persian “ Gulf to Tehran by English capital, on whatever “ terms a Concession for the purpose may be “ offered.” D. It may here be observed that the opposition of Her Majesty’s Government to a Russian railway through Khorasan was throughout of a determined character. In July 1890 the instructions sent to Tehran on this subject were to the following effect : — “ In the event of Russia endeavouring to force “ Persian Government to agree to a railway line “ through Khorasan, you should act on my telegram “ of the 19th May.* “ If the Shah asks how far he can count upon “ the support of this country in resisting such a “ demand, you should renew the assurance given “ to His Majesty on the 21th October 1888.”| Opposition of Her Majesty’s Govern ment to Russian Line through Khora san. Lord Salisbury's Telegram No. 76, 5th July 1890. (P. 90 * Preceding paragraph. t See. paragraph 3. 10. Towards the end of the year, however, the whole question of railways in Persia entered upon a uew T phrase. It had been reported by Sir H. D. Wolff in the preceding April that it w^as the in tention of the Russian Government to ask for a prolongation for 10 years of the Agreement of 1889 (see paragraph 5), and that, by additional clauses, Persia was to be prevented within that period from constructing any railways with loans or her own money. The report was, in fact, well- founded, and on the 11th November the Shah Russian Agreement of 1890 pro hibiting railway construction. Sir H. P. Wolff’s Telegram No. 112, 29th April 1890.

It pro bably represented the views of the Russian Ministry of Finance. (P. 28.) Sir R. Morier’s Despatch No. 283, 12th November 1890. (P. 28.) tM.de Giers (who was at the time unwell) was much gratified at the conclu sion of the agreement prohibiting railway construction in Persia for 10 years. “ You “ will do me the justice,” he said to Sir R. Morier, “ to admit that from the very first “ I have opposed railway construction in ‘‘ Persia in every form. What this resist- “ ance has cost me you can have no idea. “ On all sides and by all parties I have “ been pestered to grant concessions, and “ insisting on the Persian Government “ granting concessions. All this is over “ now, and there will be x’est and quiet.” signed an agreement with the Russian Government of which clause 1 ran as follows :— 1 . The Persian Government engages for the “ space of 10 years, beginning from the date of “ signature of this Agreement, neither itself to construct a railway in Persian territory nor to ^ permit nor grant a Concession for the construction ^ of railways (o a Company or other persons ; and ^ after the expiration of 10 years the renewal of the prolongation shall be immediately discussed “ between the two Parties.” d he full text of the Agreement’' is printed in Aitchison’s “ Treaties ” (1909), Vol XII Ad- pendix XIV. 1 On instructions from Lord Salisbury, Sir R. Morier explained to M. de Giers, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that, although Her Majesty’s Government considered 10 years as too long a period for Persia to be deprived of the benefits of a railway system, they nevertheless were ready to accept the 10 years period agreed upon, but not on the condition that at the end of that time the Persian Government should be bound to determine, m conjunction with Russia, whether they would further prolong this system of inactivity, or, if not, decide with Russia what railways should be con structed. Her Majesty’s Government considered such a condition as tantamount to an abdication of the Shah’s sovereign rights, nor could they agree to a unilateral engagement on the part of the Shah in regard to railway construction, which would pre judice their just claims as regards railways in the south. | The Quetta-Seistan Railway pro ject.

Memoi-andum by Sir H. Brackenbury, 2nd October 1890. 11 . One result of the “sterilising” agreement just described was to put an end to discussion regarding a projected railway from Quetta through Baluchistan to the borders of Seistan.f The idea of this line had been put forward by Colonel Mark Bell, and found a warm advocate in Sir H. Drum mond Wolff. The latter pointed out, in a Despatch of the 19th February 1889, that such a line “ would neutralise the commanding position achieved by Russia by means of the Trans-Caspian line for “ carrying out her designs in Afghan Turkestan ; ” and again, on the 19th August 1890, he wrote : — “ It appears to me that anyone looking at the “ map will see how advantageous such a line would be from every aspect, whether military, political, “ or economical. The possession of Persia is a con- “ sideration of vital importance, and so long as we “ trust for our power of defending her from aggres- “ sion to operations beginning at the sea, to be “ continued by difficult marches northward, or by a “ long march through Baluchistan without a rail- “ way, we must at once recognise the superiority of “ the Russian position, strengthened by railways “ converging on Persia on every side, and grasping “ her north, north-east, and west in a network of “ iron. S. 47. B10 “ \s Her Majesty’s Government must have gathered from all the correspondence, Khorasan practically belongs to Russia. d ith the com pletion of the road from Askhabad to Meshed, this ■ stste of actual though not of titular possession is ‘ also completed. As regards Khorasan, I ersia is ‘ positively at the mercy of Russia, and with the ‘ possession of that province, the whole of the ‘ north of Afghanistan is also menaced. The line 'was advocated by Sir H. Drummond vVollf also on commercial grounds, since beistan vas a fertile district, of which development could 3 e carried still further by a system of irrigation ‘ The price of grain,” moreover, “ and other com- ‘ modi ties in Khorasan is so remarkably cheap ‘ that the province would provide a granary for ‘ portions of India, as well as it now does for ‘ Traus-Caspia, and in the same proportion the sale “ of our goods in Persia must necessarily progress. “ If the Trans-Caspian Railway pays, there “ i s no reason why a line from Quetta to Seistan, “ one of the most fertile provinces in Persia, “ should not prove equally remunerative. ^ At “ all events, it would give us access to Persia u and her vast resources, and show that we were “ not deficient in developing progress mid in our “ intention to defend our own interests. 12. The views of Sir H. D. Wolff were not shared by Sir H. Bracken bury, the Director of Military Intelligence. In his opinion the important thing was that a line should be constructed Irom Moham- merah to Tehran via Shuster, Bala-rud, Burujird, and Kum. It would tap the commerce of Persia from the south, and in time branches might be thrown out from Burujird noith-west to l\eiman- shah and south-east to Ispahan, the luttei being ultimately prolonged to Yezd, and possibly, even, after a lapse of time to Kerman. Views of Sir H. Brackenbnry on (1) Mohammerah-Tehran Railway; (2) Quetta-Seistan Railway. Minute by Sir Oil. 1 QQG H. Brackenbury, “ All these towns are of commercial importance, ^ “ and although the country, in its present condition, “ may not be able to support a railway, still, if the “ development above hinted at be lealized, sih h “a line might ultimately prove a paying concern. “ Looking some distance ahead, it is possible that “ our Indian Empire may absorb and develop the “ whole of Baluchistan and possibly incorporate “ Seistan within its frontier. In that case om “ railway system might join with the l ersian net- work at Kerman, and it would then be certainly “ 0 f advantage to have the line from Kerman via “Ispahan and Burujird,in English hands: we “ should thus have a direct railway route from “ India to the Persian capital. But this is not all. “ for it is stated (by Colonel Mark Bell) that a “ railway might be constructed readily from “ Kermanshah to Bagdad, and if this should turn “ out to be the case, it would certainly be of value “ to us to have the line from Bagdad via Kerman- “ s l ia h, Ispahan, Kerman, on to the Indian frontier, “ under British influence.

Brackenbury, 8th October 1889. (P. 6~) ^ # It should be mentioned, as regards 8ir H. Brackenbury’s views, that in a note written by h im as M i litary Member in India, on the 27th April 1891, he explained that he had only objected to a Seistan Railway so long as the Russians did not extend their railways south of the Trans- Caspian line: vide paragraph 25 of Lord Curzon’s Minute, printed as Appendix I. 1 he safety of our Indian Empire from any attack by Ilussia lies in the distance which separates the Russian base on the Trans-Caspian Railway from the Indian frontier, combined with the difficulties of supply and transport throughout “ that distance which render it impossible for large “ forces to be employed against India. Every mile of railway which Russia makes southward into ‘‘ Khorasan or along the Perso-Afghan frontier “ diminishes pro tanto those difficulties. Convinced that all idea of an invasion of ‘‘ India by Russia from her present base may be saiely dismissed, I am equally convinced that at some future day, when Khorasan and Northern Afghanistan have been pierced by Russian “ railways and turned into granaries for Russian armies, unless an unforeseen convulsion has “ broken up the Russian Empire, Great Britain “ will be confronted with this fearfully difficult problem how to defend her Indian frontiers “ against the masses which Russia will then be “ able to employ. Commercially, every rood of “ Eastern ground that comes under Russian “ influence is so much lost to British trade ; and 1 “ hold, therefore, that it is little short of treason to “ every interest of our Empire to connive at, or “ assist in any way, the promotion of Russian “ railways in the north of Persia.” Sir 11. Brackenbury denied the strategic im portance of the Quetta-Seistan railway, and also questioned the prospect of its commercial success :— “ The greater part of the line would pass through a “ desert, and it could not possibly pay commer- “ cially unless Seistan were greatly developed.”^' b a12 At the close of the controversy, Lord Salisbury recorded the following minute : ^ Pol 929 / 90 . “ If Russia makes her railway through Khorasan, “ the north of Persia is hopelessly lost, ill the “ south of Persia—the region which stretches south “ of the desert, and includes Shuster, Ispahan, “ and Seistan—be lost also ? “ The answer to that question largely depends “ on some such line as that under consideration. “ If it, is not made, Southern Persia must ail too “ Afghanistan so embraced, must be indefensible “—the advanced Russian posts will be on tie “ Helm and. I should, however, ^myself, prefer a “ railway to Seistan from the sea. 13. No such railway as that suggested by Lord Salisbury was proceeded with, nor were railways m Persia generally any more discussed during the next few years. Mention may, however, be made at this point of a suggestion brought forwarcl orally by the Russian Government in IbJb ioi the joining of their Merv-Kushk Railway to the Indian svstem by a line passing, not through 1 ersia, but through Afghanistan. The suggestion was made to Sir R O’Conor who had previously enquired of the Russian Government as to the truth of a report that material was stored at Kushk for the extension of the Russian railway, in case of necessity, to Herat. The report was admitted to be true, and it was not denied that the Merv- Kushk Railway existed solely for strategic reasons. The Indian railways—observed M Witte—had been pushed on to the Afghan frontier for much the same reasons, but by the linking of the Russian and Indian systems the mutual commercial interests of the two countries would be so closely knit “ that an aggressive policy on the part of either “ country would be rendered well-nigh impossible. He further said that “the railway, being a 00111 - “ mercial project, it ought to be stipulated that “it should not be used for the transport of troops. Sir N. O’Conor rejoined that it would probably be extremely difficult to obtain the consent of the Amir of Afghanistan to the suggested railway, and that, since the railway would be constructed with British capital, and we had also a political 1 rotec- torate over Afghanistan, there would be insuperable objections to any stipulation forbidding the transport of British troops over the railway :—“ Such a stipu- “ lation would be tantamount to allowing Russian “ troops to be moved freely almost to the gates of “ Herat, while Her Majesty’s forces were kept at the “ other extremity of the country under their Pro- “ tectorate.” The Ambassador also questioned M. Witte as to tariffs on the Caucasian line, and observed that, if he imposed prohibitive import duties or heavy transit dues, all commercial advan tage to us would be lost. M. Witte admitted this, and said that, of course, there were many points of this kind that would have to be studied and worked out.

These rumours need not presumably be treated very seriously. The Russian proposal was not followed up, and indeed it may be said of all proposals for railways through Afghanistan that they have been mentioned only to be excluded for the reason referred to in the present case, viz., the difficulty of securing the Amir s consent. There is not oidy himself, but his subjects, to be reckoned with.' ::: ‘ Renewal of rumours as to Rus sian Railway proiects in Persia. M. Rittich’s pamphlet. Sir C.

About the end of the 10 years’ period for which the Russian Agreement of 1890 was to be in force, there was a renewal of rumours as to Russian railway projects in Persia, and the activity of Russian engineers in different parts of the country. The anxiety of Russia may, perhaps, be in part explained by the fact, reported in a despatch from the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that “ M. Witte was much disturbed by the grant of the “ concession to Germany for the (Jonstantinople- “ Bagdad line, and by the idea of this line “ being possibly connected through Persian ter- “ ritory with Indian railways, and thus forming “ a direct trade route to x\sia, which would seriously “ injure the prospects of the Trans-Siberian and “ other projected Russian lines.” The Ambassador also sent home about this time a summary of a Chauvinistic pamphlet on “Railways m Persia” by a Russian officer (M. Rittich), who described Great Britain, then involved in South Africa, as the “ Modern Carthage,” and declared that Russia should push forward lines from Tabriz through Tehran to Bunder Abbas, with a branch from Tehran to Kushk. He also indicated two Russian lines through Afghanistan, one from Kushk to Kandahar via Herat, and the other from Chardjui to Peshawar passing to the north-east of Kabul. “ The defence of India,” he wrote, “ on the side of “ Baluchistan is weak, and acting on this side we “ may achieve the highest results. Every plan for “ the defence of India is centralised in the north, “ where two-thirds of the whole army are con- “ centrated, where the passes are very difficult and “ the fortifications powerful. Leaving the Turkes- “ tan army on the Hank of Afghanistan, in order to “ make a demonstration and for active operations, “ we can throw the other Turkestan and Caucasian “ armies into Seistan, Baluchistan, and Central ‘ India. There will be no impediment and no “ opposition to our forces. The English railway “ across Nushki will be useful to us for the “ conveyance of stores, and if the English connect “ it with Meshed, we shall have a direct line “ of communications with the Caucasus and “ Turkestan.” In commenting on this pamphlet, Mr. C. (now Lord) Hardinge observed :—“ The strategical con- “ siderations put forward by the author are of no “ great value, since it is evident that, so long as “ the British fleet is able to command the Persian “ Gulf, an advance on India through Seistan and “ Baluchistan would be exposed to a flank attack “ by a British force acting from the south upon B 314 “ the Russian line of communications at a great “ distance from the Russian base. the wailike “ Bakhtiari and Kashgai tribes and the Lurs ot “ Luristan would under such circumstances become “ important factors in the struggle .’ 1 15. Some three years later Mr. (now Sir C.) Spring-Rice, Charge d’Aftaires at Tehran, commu nicated further information regarding M. Rittich, who had, it appeared, been specially sent to Persia and Persian Baluchistan in 1900 by the Russian Government to investigate as to railways, and economic, political and military conditions, dhe information included two lengthy confidential repoits from that officer, and their gist may be gathered from the following extracts from Mr. Spring-Rice’s despatch :— “4. The various routes to the south have been “ subjected to a close examination. The Russian report strongly recommends the route via Yezd, “ Kerman, Bam, to Oharbar, outside the 1 eisian “ Qidf, and giving direct access to the ocean. 1 his “ route is recommended in consequence of the k&lt; great difficulties attending the construction of a “ Tine to Bunder Abbas or Bushire, the naval “ predominance of England on the Gulf, and the “ alleged unsuitableness oi these ports for a naval “ station. It is suggested that a branch should be “ constructed from Bam to Seistan, which un- “ ‘ doubtedly might serve as a place d'armes for a “ ‘ movement on Kandahar, and through Nushki to “ ‘ Quetta.’ The writer adds that ‘ the English “ ‘ have already facilitated our operations in this “ ‘ direction by constructing a caravan road and “ ! digging wells.’ ” “ 5 . With regard to the question of the con- “ struction of a railroad by the English, the writer “ alludes to the experience gained by Russia in “ Manchuria, which shows with what ease and “ celerity a railway once made can be repaired, “ however complete its destruction. ‘ From a “ military point of view,’ he remarks, ‘ it would “ absolutely play into our hands.’ “ 6 . Colonel Napier (Military Attache at “ gt. Petersburg) points out that in making an “ attack upon India the main difficulty which “ Russia would have to encounter would be trans- “ port. If, therefore, Russia has a line through “ Persia to bring up her troops, as well as the “ Trans-Caspian and Orenburg-Tashkenr lines, the “ attack would be greatly facilitated. . . . . “ 8 . With regard to the cost of the line from “ Trans-Caucasia via Resht and Tehran to Chakh- “ i-bahr (Charbar) the Russian report estimates “ it at 19,695,COOL, allowing 1,575,O0OC for the “ construction and armament of a port. The “ distance is given as 2,290 versts (1,500 miles). “ The estimate allows 8,5000 per verst.* it is to “ he observed that the Siberian Railway cost “ 12,2850 per verst, and the Manchurian 17,8500, Further information as to views of M.

A force of about 4,000 men is “ considered sufficient. 10 . I he cost of the line and port, which even “ according to the estimate is nearly 20 , 000 , 000 L, ^ must act as an effectual deterrent for some time to come. “ The construction of a through railway to the ‘‘ Persian Gulf was a favourite scheme of M. Witte’s, and the removal of that Minister from the Treasury as well as the unfortunate experience “ gained by Russia in Manchuria, will probably act as deterrents to the commencement of railway “ enterprise in Persia. 1 he general ideas underlying the proposed scheme appear to be two :— “(P) To facilitate an attack upon India; and “ (2.) To construct a through route by rail to “ the Indian Ocean. “It is pointed out, however, that in the “ latter case a line through Persia to the south ‘ will only be profitable on condition that Russia ‘ lias the right to impose customs duties, as in “ ‘ the contrary case this route, while facilitating “ ‘ access for foreign goods, will injure Russian ‘ trade, not only in Central, but in Northern “ ‘ Persia.’ “ This, of course, implies the practical annexation “ of Persia.” Mr. Spring-Rice’s Despatch from The interest of M. Rittich s writings for the St. Petersburg, No. 239, 12th May 1904. purposes of this memorandum consists in their (P. 61.) exemplification of Russian forward policy, as ex pounded by the extreme military party. It only remains to add that there were at the beginning of 1904 rumours of the lease of Charbar to Russia. The truth of the rumours was doubted, but Colonel Napier, Military Attache at St. Petersburg, re ported :—“ From conversations that I have had “ with Russian officers, I am convinced that they “ want a port outside the Persian Gulf, and I “ believe that Charbar is the particular port they “ have in view.” Reminder to Shah of late Shah’s 16.

It will be seen from what 1 have written “ that Seistan is, by virtue of its position and its “ features, an object of much interest both to Russia “ and Great Britain Situated at the point ol “ junction of the frontiers of Persia, Afghanistan, “ and Baluchistan, its future affects the destinies ol “all three countries. Lying, as it does, almost “ midway between Meshed and the Persian Gull, “ no advance can be made from Khorassan to the “ se a except through Seistan. Its position upon “ the exposed flank of Afghanistan would render “ its occupation of great value to any Power con- “ templating either a move against that country or “ an advance upon Kandahar. Nor will it be “ denied that the Kandahar-Herat line could not be “ held with safety by India, nor the Valley oi the “ Helmand defended, were a hostile Power m “ possession of Seistan. I urthermore, the grain- “ producing capabilities of the district, to the “ bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is “ borne by the immense number of ruined cities “ encumbering the soil, and which could, without “ serious difficulty, be revived by a scientific “ employment of the waters of the Uelmand, render “ Seistan of much value, as a possible granary, “ either to a Power engaged upon a forward “ advance or to a Power interested in commercial “ and industrial expansion.” lu the same minute the project was discussed of railway connection between Quetta and Seistan, and the controversy reviewed that had taken place between Sir H D. Wolff and Sir H. Brackenbury on that subject. The conclusion arrived at was that a Quetta-Seistan Railway was rightly condemned if it was oidy intended as an offensive and strategical scheme; its real object, however, was something different, viz., to save Southern Persia from falling into the grasp of Russia. It was, piopeil} speaking, a protective, not an offensive, measure, but Lord Curzon considered that for the time being, especially if we could come to an agieement with Russia, it would be better to postpone consideration of the scheme, though, except with regard to water, it offered no engineering difficulties.

Those who employ it fail altogether to discriminate between commercial pleas and political ambitions. It may “ be urged that, whereas Russian manufacturers. m then attempt to gain access to the Pastern “ markets, are at present compelled to make the “ long and circuitous journey by the Black Sea, “ the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea, be!ore they can reach the Indian Ocean, it “ would be an advantage could they be transported by railroads either from the Caucasus, or from the Caspian, to the Persian Gulf: although the apparent value of such a gain would probably be “ a good deal discounted in practice by the com- “ paratively limited trade of Russia (which, however, “ may admit of a considerable development in the “ future), still more by the superior cost of land “ carriage over sea carriage. In so far as these are “ the ambitions of Russia, it is not probable that “ any one would seriously resist their satisfaction. “ They can be accomplished—provided the money “ be forthcoming —by amicable arrangements with “ Persia and with Great Britain. I am not, myself, “ a believer in the paying capacities of a Trans- “ Persian line for many years to come. The country “ itself is poor, and caunot furnish either the capital “ or the traffic. Were the line, however, an open “ line, it might conceivably attract the Russian “ trade from one end, and the Indian trade from “ the other, which would enable it to subsist. It “ is also conceivable that capitalists might be willing “ to come forward and construct it—-though were “ I a capitalist, I should not be found among “ their number—and arrangements might be made “ by which, while the line remained Persian “ property, the construction and maintenance of “ the northern portion might be entrusted to Russia, “ and those of the southern portion to Great Britain, “ a joint guarantee of the three Governments being “ applied to the whole. The railway might termi- “ nate on the Gulf in a Persian port, open to the “ commerce of all nations, but subject to the import “ and export dues prescribed by the Persian tariff. “ I should, myself, regard such a venture as pre- “ mature and as speculative in the highest degree, “ but I do not see anything in it that need neces- “ sarily arouse political jealousy or international “ complications.”18 Lord Curzon went on to explain that, what Russia really desired, was not a commercial rad- wav but one “ built exclusively by Russian capital, “ managed and officered entirely by Russian agents “ constructed not for commercial but for political “ and strategical objects, and terminating m a “ Russian, as distinct from a Persian, port, that “ would presently be converted not merely into a “ coaling station,'but into a fortified naval base on “ the Indian Ocean.” The remainder of the minute dwelt on the serious commercial, political, and strategical consequences that would follow from the establishment of Russia in such a commanding position. British trade would be extinguished, and the possession of Seistan which would be conferred by a Russian railway would enable Russia to menace the entire western flank of Afghanistan and exercise on the tribes of Baluchistan and Mekran a disturbing and anti-British influence. There would be similar objections to a Russian “ political ” railway terminating at any port of the Persian Gulf, whether Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, or Charbar. (Paragraphs 12 to end of the minute are printed as Appendix II.) The discussion of policy closed with the com munication to the Shah of Lord Lansdowne s Despatch No. 2, dated the 6th January 1902, to the British Minister at Tehran, from which the following is an extract : — “ As regards railways, I may remind you that “in March 1889 the late Shah of Persia gave a “ distinct promise in writing that Great Britain “ should have priority in the construction of a “ southern railway to I ehran ; that if concessions “ for railways were given to others in the north a “ similar concession should be gianted to an “ English Company in the south; and that no “ southern railway concession should be granted “ to any foreign Company without consultation “ with the British Government. This pledge was “ brought to the notice of the present Shah in April “ 1900 ,' :i: 'and was acknowledged by His Majesty to he “ of continued and binding validity. “As regards Seistan, I have quite recently, in “ my Despatch of the 9th July 1901, directed you “ to call the attention of the Persian Government “to the interest which this district has for Great “ Britain on account of its proximity to India and “ its position on an important trade route between “ India and Persia, and to state that we regard it “ as of the utmost importance that it should remain “ free from the intrusion of foreign authority in any “ shape.” 19. In the following year, on the 5th May, Lord Lansdowne made in the House of Lords the decla rationthat “ we should regard the establishment of “ a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian “ Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace “ to British interests, and we should certainly resist “ it with all the means at our disposal.” He added v Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch No. 2, 6th January 1902.

In the couise of a conversation with the Itussian Ambassador on the subject of this declaration, Lord Lansdowne observed : — t e in this country recognised the prepon- “ derance of Russia in north Persia. On the other “ hand we had special interests in the Gulf, in the south ports, and also in Seistan. With regard to the latter we should certainly regard with serious appiehension any attempt on the part of Russia “ to construct a railway from the north so as to threaten the frontiers of India on the Baluchistan “ side.” Renewal of the Russian Railway Agreement of 1890.

Aide-memoire of Russian Government, 15th August 1908. (Appendix IV.) „ A. Hardinge’s Separate Despatch, ^rd December 1905. (P. 23.) 20. The Russian Railway Agreement of 1890, as explained in paragraph 10, was intended to run for 10 years. Towards the end of that time there was much uncertainty for what period the Agreement had been renewed, but in December 1904 Sir A. Hardinge forwarded from Tehran, together with an authentic copy of-the 1890 Agreement, a Memo randum* communicated by Count Mouravieff to the Persian Minister at St. Petersburg in 1899, in which it was laid down as one of three conditions of the Russian loan, which was granted in the following year, that “ the Persian Government will renew “ the previous engagement and undertake that, for “ another 10 years, excepting the Russian Govern- “ ment, no other Government will be given a con- “ cession to build railways in Persia.” To the Memorandum was appended an autograph order of the Shah to the Sadr Azam, in which it was said : “ 1 have agreed to the three conditions.” In a later Despatch, however, Sir A. Hardinge reported that the question of the term for which the Agree ment had been rendered was still not altogether free from doubt, since the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had declared his belief that the term of renewal by the Shah had been five, not ten years. Ultimately, it was ascertained that the period of the Agreement in fact expired in 1910. Some remarks may here be quoted of Sir A. Hardinge, in a report written by him in December 1905, on relinquishing the post of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran :— “From our own point of view, we need not, I “ think, be eager to hasten the advent of the c 220 “ railway era m Persia. Different views will, no “ doubt, be taken of this question, according as we “ assign the chief importance to commercial or to “ military considerations. The opening of Persia “ to railways would undoubtedly be most advan- “ tageous to our trade, and might enable us to “ recapture many markets in the northern and “ central parts of the country, from which we have “ been driven by Russia, or in which we aie feebly “ struggling to compete with her. (In the othei “ hand, it would mean sooner or later the linking up of the Russian and Indian railway systems, “ and, even without that, it would give Russia a “ very great advantage in any offensive operations “ which she might undertake against us or against “ Afghanistan, through Persia.” 21.' With the signature, on the 31st August 1907, of the Anglo-Russian Convention embodying an “Arrangement concerning Persia (Appendix Hid, the question of railways in Persia entered upon a new phase. With regard to Article 111 of the Arrangement, enquiry was made by the Government of India as to its effect on the pledges concerning railways in Southern Persia given by former Shahs on the 16th September 1888 (paragraph 5), and the 11th April 1900 (paragraph 16) The reply elicited from the Foreign Office was to the following effect “ The Arrangement would clearly prevent Mis “ Majesty’s (iovernment from constructing a rail- “ way line as far as Tehran, but, in Sir F. Grey’s “ opinion, the wording of the pledge given by “ Nasr-ed-Din Shah in 1888 would justify them in “ asking to be allowed to construct a line in “ Southern Persia, should they desire to do so, “ in the event of the Russian Government obtaining “ a concession to construct one in the north. “ The Government of India will doubtless not “ overlook the fact that the Russian Government “ have undertaken, by the new Arrangement, not “ to oppose concessions supported by His Majesty s “ Government in the British sphere, nor, without “ previous discussion with His Majesty s Govern- “ ment, in the neutral zone either, and that the “ position of Great Britain is therefore stronger in “ this respect at present than it was before the “ signature of the Convention.” This letter was followed by another, dated the 25th September, in which the Foreign Office laid stress, in connection with the Anglo-liussian Con vention, on the desirability of considering the question of railway construction in Persia, and, in particular, whether a British concession would be advantageous for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, with possible continuation to Ahwaz, and a junction with the Bagdad Railway.

In a letter to the Foreign Office the India Office remarked that the points laised had been covered by the inquiries of the F ersian Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.t Mr. Marling also forwarded from Tehran a note by Mr. Loraine, commenting on the same memorandum, and expressing a strong preference for railways rather than roads Incidentally Mr. Loraine observed :—“ It is hardly doubtful that “ the line from Mohammerah to Tehran via the Diz \ alley is of primary importance. It is apparently the line of least resistance from the seaboard “ to the Iranian plateau ; it is the shortest route, it traverses good country, it debouches at what is, ‘ for the Persian Gulf, a good port, and not an open “ roadstead like Bushire. 23. In replying to Mr. Marling’s despatch, Sir E. Grey wrote as follows, describing what had taken place during the King’s visit to the Emperor of Russia at Reval:— “Sir C. Hard inge informed M. Isvolsky on that occasion that His Majesty’s Government would approve of a line passing through Persia and ending in the Gulf at Mohammerah, and “ pointed out the advantages of this route from a “ Russian point of view. “ His Excellency studied the proposed route on “ the map with evident interest, and observed that, although it would have the undoubted advantage “ of neutralising the Bagdad Railway, he feared “ that it would be economically disadvantageous to “ Russia, as it would facilitate the competition of “ foreign seaborne trade with that of Russian “ goods brought by rail. “ Sir C. Hardinge having observed that such “ would be the effect of all railways whithersoever “ they might lead, his Excellency said that the “ matter was one which would require careful “ study, and that he would inform me later of his U * 5) views. On the 28th July 1908 His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires reported from St. Petersburg that the Russian Government were ready to accept in principle a line from Julfa (the. terminus of the Russian railway) to Mohammerah. The India Office recognised fully the political and material advantages of securing the concession for such a line, but expressed misgiving regarding the financial aspect of the question and the possible liabilities into which India might be drawn. 24. The views of the Russian Government on railways in Persia were next stated in an aide- memoire of the 15th August 1908, of which a copy is printed as Appendix IV. The Russian Govern ment agreed in principle to a line from Julfa to Mohammerah, and, being unable to furnish the capital themselves, were ready to settle the financial side of the question with Great Britain ; they also c 3&lt;■&gt;'&gt; wished to arrange simultaneously the question of an external Persian loan. t hey proposed that the Julfa-Mohammerah line should be joined with Tehran, and, further, that Tehran should be linked up with Resht and Enzeli. The necessity of constructing a line from Askhabad to Meshed had also to be considered. In order to preserve Russian commercial interests in the north, it would pro bably be necessary to examine the question of freight rates on the Mohammerah line. As a basis for an interchange of views, a copy was annexed to the Memorandum of a confidential letter from Sir H. D. Wolff to M. de Staal, dated London, the the 20th January 1900. in which the former had advocated as part of an entente between Great Britain and Russia a line from Enzeli to Moham merah, with certain transit dues, levied at each end, as security for a loan to be guaranteed by Russia, Great Britain, and Persia. 25. The views of the India Office on the Russian aide-mcnwrre were asked for in a letter from the Foreign Office dated the 17th September 1908. In reply it was explained that, in Lord Morley s opinion, the paramount difficulty was that of finance, and that the Indian Exchequer would be unable to provide funds for any scheme of railway construction in Persia. The letter concluded in the following Views of India Office on foregoing. Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 28th September 1908. (P. 411.) (Pol. 3874/08.) way :— “7. There is the further difficulty to be cou- “ sidered in connection with the railway question “ that it has not yet been ascertained for certain “ that the construction of the proposed line (i.e., “ Mohammerah-Julfa) is practicable from the “ engineering point of view. The evidence taken “ by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of “ Imperial Defence showed that not only have no “ surveys been made, but that there has not been a even such an examination of the country through “ which the line would run as to enable even the “ roughest forecast, either of the cost or of the “ alignment to be followed, to be made ; nor have “ we, so far as Lord Morley is aware, any infor- “ mation as to the cost of the lines proposed in the “ Russian sphere. “ 8. Lord Morley’s view on the general question, “ as at present advised, is that it is impracticable “ to take into consideration the question of iinme- “ diate construction. The most that could be “ contemplated would, in his opinion, be to obtain “ jointly with Russia pledges from the Persian “ Government, which would make it impossible for “ any third Power to obtain concessions for railways. “ But it would have to be clearly stipulated that “ His Majesty’s Government are not pledged to “ actual construction till the development of Persia “ makes it possible for the scheme to be financed on “ sound lines. “ 9. I am to draw Sir E. Grey’s attention to the “ bad effect that would be produced on public23 opinion in India and Afghanistan if it were believed that the Russian Government intended ^ to make the line to Meshed referred to in their * Memorandum.” Memorandum of 9th October 1908, in reply to Russian Aide-Memoire. (P. 18.) (Pol. 3970/08.) 26. With the concurrence of the India Office reply was made to the Russian aide-memoire in a memorandum dated the 9th October 1908 and handed to M. Isvolsky on the 14th idem, of which the text is printed as Appendix V. In this it was explained that His Majesty’s Government had con templated not the actual construction of railways, but rather the ear-marking of concessions, and—apart from the uncertainty of the political situation— attention was drawn to the absence of surveys, the doubt as to the ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and the doubt as to the con struction of a branch line from Bagdad to Khanikin, as factors which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, rendered impracticable in existing circumstances any definite scheme of railway development in Persia. A railway from Julfa to Mohammerah could not therefore be built with adequate prospects of commercial success, and His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest for railways in Persia. The finances of Persia should be set in order before such railways were constructed, but “ Great Britain and Russia would be fully justified “ in informing the Persian Government that, in the “ event of railway communications being established “ in Persia, they would expect to have the refusal, “ upon terms equally favourable to any offered by “ third parties, of all concessions which might be “ in contemplation.” Besides the southern section of a Julfa-Mohammerah line, the concessions most closely concerning His Majesty’s Government were for lines from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz, with option for a port at Khor Musa. It would be well nigh impossible for Great Britain to assent to anything like a discrimination of tariff rates in favour of Russian goods on the Mohammerah railway. A hope was • expressed that the Askhabad-Meshed project might remain in abeyance. Views of Sir G. Barclay on the Russian Aide-Memoire. Sir G. Barclay’s Despatch No. 288, 4th November 1908. (P. 132.) Pol. 4161/08. 27. After the Russian aide-memoire had been answered, a despatch was received from Sir G. Barclay, dated the 4th November 1908, which specially dealt with the question of differential rates on the Mohammerah-Julfa line : “I do not know whether any decision has “ been taken as regards the alignment of the pro- “ posed railway, but I presume that it will pass “ through Tabreez, Kazvin, Hamadan, Burujird, “ Khoremabad, Dizful, Shuster, and Ahwaz. Our “ existing commercial interests, which would be “ directly affected by such a line, lie almost “ entirely within the Russian zone. Our trade, ‘ which now passes from the head of the Persian “ Gulf through Bagdad and Khanikin to Kerman- “ shah and Hamadan, shows an increase during the C 4“ last four years of from 700,0001. to 1,09L,000L “ Besides this, British goods to the value of about “ 150,000L enter the Russian zone by Trebizond to “ Tabriz. Both these branches of British trade “ would evidently be diverted to the Mohamrnerah- “ Julfa railway when built, and both, if given a “ f a i r chance, would then doubtless show consider- “ able development; but, if the principle of ddfer- “ ential treatment throughout the Russian zone is “ admitted, they are sure to be handicapped out ot “ existence, which will be all the easiei vvhen “ Vladikavkas is linked up with lifb.s, and thiough “ traffic established from the districts north oi “ the Caucasus. “Against this we might, I presume, count on “ an increase of trade in the neutral zone, lesulting u as time goes on from the development of the “ regions through which the line passes, but, “ though some of these possess no doubt gieat “ potential wealth, their development seems at pie- “ sent very remote. They are thinly populated, “ and a great part of the line will run through the “ most lawless districts in Persia. In any case we “ already monopolize such trade as theie is in thtse “parts, and our only gain would accrue from the “ .expansion of trade already in our hands. In “ short, we should gain nothing at Russia s expense, “ whereas she would gain much at ours. On the “ other hand, it must be admitted that a railway “ from Mohammerah to Julfa, run on the puiel^ “‘open-door’ principle, would probably result in “ disaster for Russian vested interests. Possibly a “ workable arrangement might be devised by which “the differential tariff could be restricted to the “ regions north of those fed from Kermanshah and “ Hamadan.” Sir G. Barclay also dwelt on the advantage of rail ways to Persia herself, since “ their existence would “ put a powerful weapon m the hands of the Central “Government . . . in regions where their autho- “ rity is to-day a mere shadow, and can be set at “ nought with impunity.” He further touched on the question of the effect of a railway through his coun try on the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 28. in another despatch of the same date Sir G. Barclay represented the desirability urged by Major Cox, of the examination by a reconnoitring party of the country between Bizful and Khoremabad, as a necessary preliminary of its opening np by road or railway.* “It would of course greatly injure our “ commercial prospects if, for instance, Hamadan “ were connected by rail with Julia, while the “ Mohammerah section was still on l air at “ Bizful.” 29. In the autumn of 1909 a proposal was laid before the India Office, recommended by the Indo- European Telegraph Company, by certain gentle men, including Sir F. Mo watt and Mr. 11. F. B.

Lord Morley, in forwarding the telegram, reminded the Foreign Office of the views he had already expressed as to an Askhabad-Meshed line (paragraph 25—end), and the Foreign Office in reply undertook to repeat their request to the Russian Government that a line should not be built from Askhabad to Meshed; they further pointed out that financial considerations would probably exclude it. Sir A. Nicolson, it may be added, shortly afterwards expressed doubt whether an Askhabad-Meshed bne would be likely to be enter tained by Russia as a serious project for some time to come, and he did not think that a cart road from Bunder Abbas to Kerman would awaken any anxiety in Russia. Sir G. Barclay concurred in the view that the project of a Bunder Abbas-Kerman road merited in principle the support of His Majesty’s Government,- but held out no very confident hope that the Medjliss would grant a concession, and added that the country was too unsafe to allow a survey to be undertaken without a strong escort. After consulting the India Oflice, the Foreign Office informed Mr. Stratford Andrews, who was acting on behalf of the gentlemen named, that their request was being caref ully considered, but that the Persian Government were in no position at the moment to supply the escort that would be necessary.

Towards the end of the year 1909 corre spondence was resumed as to the general question of railway construction in Persia in a letter addressed by the Foreign Office to this Office, enclosing copies of despatches from Sir G. Barclay (8th November) and Sir A. Nicolson (1st December). Sir G. Barclay, after personal consultation with Major Cox, concurred in the view that had been expressed in a Foreign Office memorandum of the 29th September 1908, written while our reply to the Russian aide-memoire was under consideration, as to the disastrous effect upon British trade in Persia of a Julfa-Mohammerah railway on the lines proposed by the Russian Government, and he emphasised the need for simultaneous construction of the railway from north and south, and for the exclusion of differ ential rates. He accepted the list of the lines mentioned to the Russian Government as those of special importance to British interests, with the addition of the link to join Bushire via Aliabad with the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line. Sir A. Nicolson’s despatch reported a conversation in which M. Isvolsky had mentioned the visit to London of the Duma deputies and their desire that through communication with India should be established. This would, M. Isvolsky thought, serve as a set-off to any detriment or risks which Russian interests might suffer by the construction of the Bagdad Railway, but he knew that it was yet too early for the project to be realised. In their letter the Foreign Office expressed general concurrence in the views of Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox, but considered that it would be better not to await a settlement with the Russian Government as to the Mohammerah-Julfa line before making a demand on the Persian Govern ment for preferential rights to construct the Mohammerah-Julfa and other lines. Their letter continued as follows :— “ Turning now to Sir A Nicolson’s despatch “ Lord Morley will observe that M. Isvolsky is n 228 “ especially anxious that His Majesty’s Government “should not refuse to consider the question ol “ joining the Russian and Indian railway As regards this question, Sir E. Grey fully “ recognises that, though this junction will doubt- “ less be effected at some future date, the moment “ i s still remote when such an enterprise could be “ carried into effect. He would, however, submit, “ for Lord Morley’s consideration, that the remote- “ ness of the time when the project can be realised “ affords no adequate reason for refusing to demand “ from the Persian Government at once the pre- “ ferential right to construct the line when it may “ suit His Majesty’s Government to link up the “ Indian railway system with those of Persia and “ Europe hy a line from Nushki to Kerman, “ Tehran, and Julfa. Such a demand in no way “ implies any obligation or intention to begin the “construction of the line immediately, while “ neglect to take this opportunity of making it “ might be punished by the grant of a similai “ privilege to a third Power, which might, for “ example, secure permission to build a line lioni “ Tehran to the south, with branches to Seistan “ and elsewhere. It is clear that the construction “ in Persia of lines in which Great Britain had no “ p ar t would be far more detrimental to British “ interests than their construction with the parti- “ cipation and under the partial conliol of His “ Majesty’s Government, “ There is at the same time no fear that the “ Russian Government woidd themselves imme- “ diately begin the construction of the line of “ jmiction, since, as was admitted in M. Isvolsky s “ memorandum of the 15th August 1908, they have “ no funds available for such a purpose. “ An additional reason for pressing this demand “ is to be found in the obvious anxiety of M. Isvol- “ sky that the question should not be treated as “ outside the range of practical politics. The “ concession to His Excellency s wishes involved “ in admitting it to consideration would, as clearly “ appears from His Excellency’s observations to “ Sir A. Nicolson, go far to reconcile him and “ public opinion in Russia generally to British “ participation in the construction of the Bagdad “ Railway, which is a matter of the mghest “ importance. “ It is therefore in Sir E. Grey’s opinion essen- “ tial, from a political point of view, that this “ demand should be made without delay, while “ from a commercial standpoint there would appear “to be no objection to the line which, if con- “ structed, would help Indian trade to compete “ with Russian. “ To resume, Sir E. Grey would suggest that, “ as a first step, the two Powers should, when the “ Persian Government approaches them with a “ request for pecuniary assistance, make it a con- “ dition of their consent to an advance that the29 * This line had not been mentioned in the British Memorandum of the 9th October 1908. See paragraph 26 and Appendix Y. “ preferential right as against other Powers to construct certain railways should be reserved to them, that these railways should include “ one from Julfa to Mohammerah by way of Tehran, and one connecting the Caucasian rail ways with the Indian system by way of Tehran, “ Kerman, and Nushki, and that His Majesty’s “ Government, for their part, should also demand the right to construct lines from— 1. Bunder Abbas to Kerman ; “ 2. Bunder Abbas to Ahwaz by way of Shiraz, “ with the option of building a port at “ Khor Musa ; and “3. Bushire by way of Aliabad to some point on “ the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz lineY His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments “ would afterwards discuss at their leisure the “ details of these schemes and the terms of “ the construction of the lines which would concern “ them in common.” Preference of India Office for a “ sterilising' ” Agreement.

In reply the India Office dwelt on the disadvantage to which His Majesty’s Government would be exposed in the negotiations if they were committed in advance to the construction of the Mohammerah-Julfa line, and, as regards the linking of the Russian and Indian Railways, on the risk of yielding to M. Isvolsky’s wishes to treat the question as not outside the range of practical politics, even though the route suggested were Julfa-Tehran-Kerman, and not one by way of Meshed and Seistan : —“ From the point of view “ of local political relations it (the Julfa-Tehran- Kerman line) is so far less objectionable than “ the other (Meshed-Seistan) that it avoids the “ eastern frontier of Afghanistan. But, strate- “ gically, the objections to it appear to be equally “ insuperable whether, after leaving Kerman, it “ proceeds via Nushki to Quetta, or, descending to “ the Gulf at Charbar, runs along the coast to “ Karachi.” As regards the other three lines, it was pointed out that the construction of lines in the south might lead to corresponding movements by Russia in the north, and doubts were cast on the probable benefit from such lines to British, or in any case Indian, trade. A preference was, in conclusion, expressed for “ an extension of the existing “ ‘sterilising’ agreement for a further term of “ years,” which would give time for other factors, such as the fate of the Bagdad Railway, to become known. Rejoinder of Foreign Office to India Office. Letter :&gt;f Foreign 0Slice to India Office, 19th January 1910. (P. 51.) Pol. 2872/10. 33. On the 19th January the Foreign Office replied at length to the arguments of this Office. They pointed out that the earmarking of the Mohammerah-Julfa line would not commit the British Government to construction work at Russia’s dictation, and that, if His Majesty’s Go vernment were to refrain from earmarking the southern portion, this would not prevent commence- D 330 ment of the northern half. Russia was unlikely, it was said, to defer railway construction m the north of Persia, whatever we might do m the south, and the argument was questioned that Indian trade would not profit by the construction of southern lines. A “sterilising” agreement would be im practicable and reactionary. . A As regards the linking up of the Russian and Indian railways, what had been feared b y&gt; bir k. Grey was that a Trans-Persian railway might be carried out by a third Power, but Sir E. Grey was now prepared to inform the Russian Government that the Government of India were unwilling to consider the question of a through railway, and to ask them not to press it. “ It will not, however, it was added, “ be possible to prevent the Russian “ Government from acquiring a, concession Rom “ Julfa via Tehran to the frontier of their sphere “ or beyond it, if they wish to do so. In Sir E. “ Grey’s opinion it would be safer for His Majesty s “Government to earmark a line from Yezd, or a “ point just outside the Russian sphere, to the “ frontier of India, so as to prevent another Power “ from acquiring it, or an endeavour might be made “ to obtain an undertaking from the Persian “ Government that they would give the line to no “ other Power.” 34 . About the time when this correspondence was proceeding, proposals were being made lor the offer by Great Britain and Russia of a joint advance to the Persian Government of 400,000k Ihe offei was made on the 18th February 1010 , in a note, dated the 16th idem, and among the conditions of the advance was one as to Persian railways in the following terms : — “4. La Perse s’engage a ne donner aucune concession pour la construction de chemins de fer en Perse avant d’en oftrir 1 option aux Gouvernements de Grand(-Bretagne et de Russie. Ce droit d’option ne sera pas exerce dans le cas ou il s’agirait d’une concession a accorder a un subjet persan dans le but de constiune et d’exploiter une ligne de chemin de fer avec des capitaux exclusivement persans, pourvu qu il soit prouve a la satisfaction des Gouvernements ‘ de Grand e-Bretagne et de Russie que ces ‘ capitaux sont reellement indigenes. The note aroused the apprehensions of the German Government, and on the 17th March the Russian Ambassador communicated to the Foreign Office copy of a memorandum addressed by Germany to his Government, in which it was ob served that the reserve Germany had hither shown in Persian matters “ ne saurait aller jusqu a empeeher “ toute tentative des milieux commerciaux et finan- “ ciers allemands de chercher en Perse un terrain “ d’activite.” The German Ambassador made repre sentations to Sir E. Grey on the same subject, and, in reply, it was explained to him that the conditions Condition, in offer of Anglo-Russian Advance to Persian Government, as to Persian Railways.

As a matter of fact, we had no great (P. 257.) “ desire to make railways ourselves in Persia at the “moment, but we wished to guard against the “ possibility of waking up some morning to find “ that the Persians had placed some railway con- “ cessions under foreign control for making railways “ where they would be damaging to our political “ interests, or strategically menacing to our fron- “ tiers. We desired, therefore, to have the option “ of making railways of this sort ourselves, and so “ rendering them unobjectionable, if the Persians “ decided to have them made by foreigners.” From this time onward the question of Persian railways becomes closely connected with that of the Bagdad Railway, and, therefore, also with German interests. It is not here proposed to enter fully into this larger question, it will be sufficient to refer briefly to the main issues, so far as they affect the discussion of Persian railways.

The negotiations referred to in the pre ceding paragraph for a joint Anglo-Russian advance made little progress, and the Persian Government seemed likely instead to borrow from other sources. In a Joint Anglo-Russian Note, dated the 7th April 1910, they were informed of the conditions on which the two Governments would assent to such borrowing, and the Note concluded in the following way “ En outre, nous avons Phonneur de vous faire “ savoir que b Angleterre et la Russie, tout en ne “ pas entravant les droits des nationaux d’autres “ Puissances aux enterprises purement commer- “ ciales en Perse, ne peuvent en aucun cas admettre “ qu’il soit accorde aux nationaux d’autres Puis- “ sances etrangeres des concessions qui puissent “ porter atteinte a leurs interets politiques ou “ strategiques en Perse.” In a Note dated the 7th May 1910, the Persian Government took exception to the ambiguity of this passage and asked for an explanation of the word “concessions.” In a further Joint Note, dated the 20th May 1910, they were informed as follows : — “ Vu la difficulte de specifier les concessions “ qui pourraient porter atteinte a leurs interets “ politiques ou strategiques, les deux Puissances “ s’attend ent a ce qu’avant de dehvrer des con- “ cessions quelconques de voies de communication, “ de telegraphes et de ports a un sujet etranger, le “ Gouvernement persan entre dans un echange de D 4 (P. 274.)“ vues avec elles afin que les interets politiques ou “ strategiques des deux Puissances puissent etre “ dument sauvegardes. Tout acte qui se trouverait “ en contradiction avec ce principe serait considere “ comme contraire a I’amitie traditionnelle qui “ existe si heureusement entre la Perse, la Russie, “ et la Grande Bretagne.” The Persian Government were urged by the British and Russian Ministers to make no reply to this further Note, but in opposition to this advice, returned a reply on the 3rd September, in which it was said that they had “ at present ” no thought of granting to foreigners the kind of concessions referred to in the Joint Note. Their reply was returned to them on the 4th September. Sir G. Barclay’s Despatch No. 169, 6 th September 1910. Pol. 4023-6/10. 36. Meanwhile, the India Office, in a letter dated the 9th May 1910, had replied to the Foreign Office letter of the 19th January 1910 {see para graph 33). Lord Morley accepted the view that sterilisation was not feasible, and concurred in the desirability of earmarking agreements to exclude the intervention of a third Power. He again expressed the view that India ought not to participate financially in the work of railway construction in Persia, and the letter also contained the following Agreement of India Office with Foreign Office, regarding earmarking Concessions, &amp;c. Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, dated 9th May 1910. (P. 148.) Pol. 663/10. passage :— “ As regards the line which it is understood the “ Russian Government are contemplating towards “ Yezdandthe British frontier in Baluchistan, Lord “ Morley, as at present advised, agrees with the view “ in your letter that a line from that frontier, whether “ at Charbar (or Gnat tar) or Robat, in the direction “ of the Russian sphere, should be ‘ earmarked ' as (P. 148.) “ the subject of a British concession, but he would “ suggest that the purpose in view would be suffi- “ ciently met if it stopped at Kerman, and he would “ propose that two concessions, viz., Kerman-Robat “and Kerman-Charbar (or Guattar), should be “ applied for. “ It follows from the objection of the British “ Government to a junction of the Indian and “ Russian systems that they should not, in existing “ circumstances, be prepared to undertake the “ construction of the lines.” The India Office letter further enclosed copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 3rd May 1910, which ran as follows (paraphrase): — “ Your telegram dated the 11th ApriP as to “ railway concessions in Persia. Securing of “ British position at the head of the Persian Gulf “ is of greatest strategical importance. The first “ step, consequently, is to get converted into a “ definite concession the option held by us for the “ southern section of the line from Julfa to Moham- “ merah up to the southern limit of the Russian “ sphere.

Nicolson having expiessed doubts whether British public opinion was ready for the scheme, “ M. Isvolsky observed u tilat in Russia also there was opposition to such u schemes, but chiefly in Russian commercial I-, r 'cles. At the same time a line traversing Persia and connecting the Russian and Indian ^ fadway systems would effectually compete with, t ^ n °t kill, the Bagdad Railway. He thought ^ that the question was one which would have to he considered seriously within the near future.” 38. On the 9th August 1910, Professor Pares of Liverpool University communicated to the Foreign Office extracts from a Memorandum J drawn up by a Russian Consortium explaining in detail the scheme referred to in the foregoing paragraph : “As to direction,” it was said, “we could hardly i£ expect the English to agree to the continuation “ of our line from Kushk, which would also be “ opposed by Afghanistan. The same partly “ applies to the construction of a line from Merv to “ Meshed, which would be strategically rather “ dangerous for the English.” lor this and other leasons, the line proposed was one by way of Rostoff,§ Baku, Tehran, and Nushki, S. 47.and the length of the journey f^mLondo^ to Bombay was taken as 0,1 &gt;6 miles ( 8 f 5 0 v ® rs ‘ s J; the time to be occupied varying from 8 days 6 hours (at 26 miles an hour) to 7 days (at 31 miles an hour! 60,000 first-class passengers were reckoned on, and '20,000 second-class, the prices of the single journey tickets from London to Bombay being 411. 6s. and 241. 12s„ respectively. Paily, instead of weekly, mails were contemplated. The cost of making the railway was estimated at about 13,5001. per mile (85,000 roubles P e r orwl tncrpthcr with interest on capitaJ (luring —j •» ».«, ww roubles).! The project was described as a great “ economic undertaking not requiring any special “ sacrifice from the Russian Imperial Exchequer, and the enterprise was to be Anglo-I ranco-Russian. It was calculated that the line would yield a net revenue of 11 , 800,000 roublest (say l, 2 o 0 , 000 (.), a sum sufficient to pay 4 per cent, on an ordinary “capital of 23,300,0001.

Vide paragraph 3 of the Report of the Inter- Departmental Committee referred to in paragraph 45 below. 39. Consulted by the Foreign Office,^the board ol Trade pronounced the scheme to be o± a very “ speculative character and put forward mainly m “ Russian interests.” The estimate of revenue was largely conjectural, and, while Russian trade would probably be considerably benefited- “ and possibly K Indian trade also m a ess degree -Umted Kingdom trade would probably not be benefited to any material extent, at any rate tor a long time after the opening of the line, and might even suffei from the expansion of Russian trade m the mtenoi of Persia. The transport of passengers would pro bably form the bulk of the business of the line. While doubting whether the scheme would attract the investor, without the guarantee of a minimum return, the Board were of opinion that His Majesty’s Government might adopt an attitude “ of benevolent neutrality ” towards it if two con ditions were fulfilled-(l) the construction of a line from Kerman to the Gulf m which British infiuence should predominate; (2) the grant of equal “ facilities for all throughout the whole lailway. A memorandum by the Director of Commercial Intelligence (Mr. Worthington) accompanied the Board of Trade letter, giving statistics of Russian trade with Persia, United Kingdom trade with Persia British India trade with Persia, and Russian trade with India. These incidentally showed that Russian trade by the Gulf is a negligible quantity, and that the bulk of British India trade is by the Gulf route , „ P On the 4th November 1910 the Secretary of State forwarded the correspondence to the Govern ment of India, with a request for the expression of their vdews.

The Despatch of the Secretary of State regarding the Trans-Persian Railway had not been long in the hands of the Government of India when news was received of an important agreement in course of^ negotiation between the Russian and German Governments as the result of the visit of M. Sazonow to Potsdam, providing (1) that the Bagdad Railway should not be opposed by Russia; (2) that Russia should link up Khanikin and lehran with the Sadijah-Khanikin Railway; (3) that Germany should not build lines between the Bagdad Rad way and the Persian frontier north of Khamkin , and (4) that Germany should recognise Russia’s special interests in the north of Persia, and not seek concessions for railways, roads, navigation, or telegraphs in the Russian sphere. The information was telegraphed to the Govern ment of India on the 30th December, and they were further informed that (according to a statement made by M. Sazonow to Sir G. Buchanan) the Russian promoters of the Trans-Persian Railway were now favouring an alignment by way of Tehran, Ispahan, \ ezd, and Kerman, though the Russian Government themselves preferred a route from Tehran south-east to Kerman “ to avoid possible risk of ^ eventual German line intersecting at “ Ispahan,” a prospect that had not been con templated by His Majesty’s Government. 41. On the 14th January a further telegram was addressed to the Government of India informing them that for the purposes of the draft Russo- German Agreement the southern limit of the Russian sphere had been made to run from Kakh to the Afghan frontier at the latitude of Gazik, and that the draft Agreement had been modified in the sense that Germany would not seek concessions in the Russian sphere without first coming to an under standing with Russia. The result was practicallv to hand over the whole of the neutral section of the Afghan frontier to Russia and Germany. In reply the Government of India expressed the view that the extension of the Russian zone, in the manner above described, was an advantage rather than the reverse, inasmuch as we should have the E 236 right to demand of Russia that she should not oome to an understanding against our interests. 1 tie Viceroy’s telegram concluded as follows (para phrase) :— “It is an indisputable fact that in the rest of “ the neutral zone, Germany has the right to seek “ concessions. In order to prevent disadvantageous “ effects to our political and strategic interests m “ Southern Persia, the only course open to us is to “ remind Germany of the assurances''' given by nei “ to His Majesty’s Government, and when occasion “ arises to repeat to the Persian Government our “ warning! against granting any concessions by “ which our' political and strategic interests m “ Persia may be prejudiced, and to threaten, it “ necessary, that steps to safeguard our interests “ will he taken.” Viceroy’s telegram, 18th January 1911.

On the 14th February 1911 a telegram was addressed to Sir G.

Sir G. Barclay was in favour of reminding the Persian Government of the Shah’s undertaking, as soon as the Regent should be firmly established, and, as regards particular lines of railway, his reply of the 27th February ran as follows (para phrase) :— Views of Sir G.

Also, it would not seem desirable to abandon to the enterprise of third Powers the important south-west corner of “ Persia. In the event of Russia linking up her railway ^ system in the north with Khoremabad and ^ allowing British goods fair play, the usefulness “ the line would, of course, greatly increase. ‘‘ This prospect is, however, unlikely, as such a “ link would be very disadvantageous to Russian interests, but even so with the Mohammerah- Khoremabad line we should be better placed to defend our trade against Russian commercial invasion, should Russia begin to construct south- “ wards from Julia. “ If Bis Majesty’s Government decide for any reason to postpone for the present the prosecution “ of tliis scheme, Colonel Cox is of opinion that “ we should have recourse to a line from Ahwaz “ or Mohammerah to Shiraz and Bunder Abbas “ Khor Musa, Bushire being linked up by a “ branch. “ Bunder Abbas-Kerman line is, of course, not “ so urgent, as it would lie in our zone. Please “ refer to my Despatch No. 232, of the 19th “ December.

I have “ not maps or figures before me, but the cost ‘‘ would certainly not be more than 2,000,000b to ‘‘ 3,000,000b, and I am assured by officials and others who are well acquainted with the country“ (1) that it would not only tap practically the “ whole of the trade now carried between Persia “ and Bagdad (he., practically nullify the objep- “ tive of the proposed Russo-German Klianikm “ line), but also open up a large and new export “ trade in cereals from the districts around “ Burujird, Kermanshah, and Hamadan, which is “ now quite impracticable owing to the prohibitive “ cost of transport, and which would not even be “ open to the suggested Khanikin-Bagdad route w because of the high river freight from Bagdad to “ the Gulf, added to the rail and/or road freight to “ Bagdad ; (2) that it would, in all probability, be “ highly remunerative; and (3) that it would “ practically ensure to the British sphere the whole “ 0 f the trade of central and northern Persia not “ secured by the Caspian, and also open up in “ competition with Russia a large amount of trade “ in British cotton goods and other manufactures. “ The capital for this railway, however good its prospects may be, cannot, of course, be obtained “ from ordinary channels without a guarantee &lt; &gt;f some “ sort, because of the insecurity of the country. 44. The Secretary of State’s despatch of the 4th November 1910 as to the Trans-Persian Rail way was answered in a letter of the Government of India, dated the 23rd February 1911, enclosing, together with a convenient index map, memoranda, &amp;c., by various officers, and the Report ol an inter - departmental Committee, consisting of Mr. W. H. Clark (Member of Council), Sir D Haig (Chief of the General Stall), Sir T. Wynne (President of the Railway Board), and Mr. J. B. W ood (foreign Department). It may be useful to summarise briefly the opinions that were expressed, though such a summary is necessarily somewhat imperfect. Views of various officers of the Government of India. Secret Letter of Government of India, No. 18, 23rd February 1911. Pol. 437/10. (1) The Political Resident in the Persian Guij (Colonel Cox) favoured an alignment from Kerman via Bam, Regaii, Bampur, Serbaz, Kej to Karachi or Hyderabad, as less open to strategical objection than a Kerinan-Nushki route, more useful through its tapping of better country, and more useful for checking the Mekran arms traffic. He thought that, as a condition of our co-operation with Russia in promoting the through route, she should join with His Majesty’s Government in obtaining a concession for a Mohammerah-Julfa line, and in commencing the Mohammerah-Hamadan section when the Khanikin branch of the Bagdad Railway was about to be linked with the Russian system via Kermanshah. He favoured concessions, for blocking purposes, of branch lines (1) from Mohammerah ma KhorMusa, Behbehan, and Shiraz to Kerman, and (2) from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, and the actual construction of a line from Bunder Abbas to the through line at Bam. (2.) The Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan (Sir H. Colonel Cox’s telegram, 20th December 1910, (enclosure 1 of Letter). Sir H. McMahon’s letter, 20th Decern her 1910. (Enclosure 2.)39 McMahon) summarised his arguments and main conclusions in the following words :— “It is unwise to expect that the present isolation “ of Persia can longer continue, or that we can “ indefinitely maintain freedom for India from inter- “ communication by rail from the West. “ The present proposal offers opportunities of a “ mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and, if “ we decline to take advantage of it, we may be “ compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway “ connection under less favourable conditions. “ The proposed railway must benefit Russian “ trade in much larger proportion than British “ trade, but it will benefit Indian trade, and largely “ increase the bulk of both British and Indian “ trade by the opening up of Persia. “ It will increase the receipts of Indian railways, “ and thereby benefit Indian revenues. “The military or political disadvantages of “ inter-railway communication are less than might “ at first sight be supposed, and are largely counter- “ acted by the access alforded by the line to “ Seistan. “ These conclusions are arrived at on the “ assumption that our efforts are directed to pre- “ venting the line destroying the autonomy of “ Persia. “ On the above grounds the proposal merits “ favourable reception, but in order to minimize “ the preliminary advantages of Russia, to assist “ British trade, prevent Russia getting an undue “ start of British and Indian trade, and for strategic “ purposes it is absolutely esssential: - “ (1.) To construct a line under British control “ from Bunder Abbas or other Gulf port to “ the central line. k ‘ (2.) That the Indian railway system be ex- “ tended to the Indo-Persian border by the “ easiest and quickest route, i.e., from Nushki. “ (3.) That work on (1) and also from the Indo- “ Persian border westwards should commence “ simultaneously with that at the Russian end. “ (4.) That work on (2) be pushed on with speed “ without necessarily waiting for the com- “ mencement of the Persian line. “ (5.) That a line be constructed in due course “ from Karachi to meet the central line within “ British limits. “ (6.) That no time be lost in commencing the “ necessary railway surveys for all the above “ lines.” um of Mv. F. Noel Paton, r 1910. (Enclosure 3.) (3.) The Director-General of Commercial Intel ligence (Mr. P. Noel Patou) emphasised the difficulty of determining to what extent India’s present trade towards Seistan and northwards might grow under the influence of a railway. He agreed generally m the view of the Board of Trade as to the value of the proposed railway for trade purposes, and advocated the immediate construction of a line from the Gulf inland. He laid stress on the civilising tendencies E 4Tr^Yrr'! iiii i~ iiiwt'iw || iw 40 that follow from railway construction, and on the assimilation of that part of Persia nearest our borders that a railway might bring about. (4.) The Chief of the General Staff (Sir D. Haig) dwelt on the advantages of India’s present isolation and on the largely increased forces that Russia might develop on the North-West Frontier pi India and Afghanistan, if the proposed line were completed. At the same time he recognised that other factors might enter into the question, and argued from this point of view, in favour oi an alignment via Yezd to Bunder Abbas (direct) am thence along the sea-coast to Karachi, Bundei Abbas itself to be fortified and held by troops No connection between this line and eithei Afghan istan or northern Baluchistan to be permitted, and the extension of Russian or Persian railways through Afghanistan to be more strongly resisted than ever. (5.) The President of the Railway Board (Sir T. Wynne) dwelt on the essential differences between the proposed line and the 1 rans-Siberian Railway, which “ connects Europe by a short route with a “ large cosmopolitan population in the 4 ai East, “ and opens up a cheaper route than the sea-route “ for trade commodities.’ He referred to the reduction m steamer fares that the proposed line would probably have to face, and considered that the possibility of goods traffic being carried between England and India was quite out of the question. But, apart from its commercial and financial aspect, the project had to lie considered in relation to the political situation, and he suggested “ that the “ attitude of India towards this matter should Memorandum by tbe General Staff, 3rd January 1911.

To cordially accept and support the pro- “ posal that an international line should be made “ from Seistan to Baku. “ (2.) To assist in this project India would build “ at once, with its own funds, the line from Nushki “ to Seistan and include it in her railway system. “ The gauge of this line at the present time to be “ left to India to decide, but it should be made an “ essential point that a break of gauge should “ occur at Seistan junction. “ (3.) The sole right to make railways in Persia “ should be secured by the concessionaires of the “ international line, and all branches should be “ built internationally. “ (4.) The basis on which railway rates are to “ be charged should be a matter for future con- “ sideration and agreement. “ (5.) Detailed surveys of the Nushki-Seistan “ line should be put in hand at once.” He also urged the desirability of actual con struction by Indian officers of the railways from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and Bushire to Ispahan.41 Report of the Indian Inter-Depart mental Committee. Report, dated 8 th February 1911. (Enclosure No. 6 to Letter of Government of India.) * I.e., 21,850,OOOZ. See paragraph 38. 45 In their Report the Indian Inter-Depart mental Committee observed that “any material u 1 ^ n P ro cement of land communications towards or thr 9 u gh the natural barriers which at present encir( hc the frontiers of India must involve a « ? re i at , 1 , n( ^ rease to the military responsibilities of India but they recognised that it might be desirable to seize the opportunity now of securing certain essential conditions in connection with a Trans-Persian Railway. With regard to the merits or the enterprise from the commercial point of view they agreed generally with the Board of Irade. They did not, moreover, think that the gross earnings of the line would be more than one-fifth of the figure assumed in the Consor tium’s estimate, and they believed that the cost of construction would be at least 50 per cent, higher than that allowed for.' : * Proceeding to examine the different routes suggested for the main line ; they decided against a line from Yezd to Nushki via Kerman and Seistan (about 810 miles), from apprehension of its effect upon the mind of the Amir and his advisers, and also on strategical grounds, described in the following words : — The adoption of this route would give to Russia ^ a railway leading directly to the frontier of ^ Afghanistan, and would enable her, in the event ‘‘ war, to turn the Kandahar and Quetta positions. ^ It would also facilitate the transportation by “ Russia of a very large army across two almost waterless deserts—a task which, under present “ conditions and without the help of a rail- way, may be regarded as practically impossible “ of accomplishment. As against this, India would receive no compensating strategical advantages. “ A line to^ Seistan from Nushki might to some extent assist India to control Western Afghanistan, but no point is offered from which a force from India could undertake offensive operations against Russia ; while the extension of our line to Seistan would make it difficult to resist a claim on the part of Russia to connect the Trans-Caspian Rail- “ way with the proposed route, in which case she “ would be able to concentrate from two directions. “ Finally, the adoption of the Seistan-Nushki align- “ ment would, owing to its distance from the sea- “ coast, completely neutralise the strategical ad vantage which Great Britain possesses in her naval supremacy.’’ Comparing next the Yezd-Kerman-Bam-Bampur- Kej-Karachi and Yezd-Bunder Abbas-Karachi align ments (about 1,147 and 1,341 miles respectively), the Committee expressed a preference for the latter as being cheaper, further removed from the Afghan border, and more accessible for sea- defence, and they summarised their conclusions, as a whole, by recommending that the Government of India should accept the proposals of the Russian S. 47. Fmam 42 'Consortium in principle, subject to the following modifications and conditions : “ (a) that the point of junction of the main “through route with the Indian railway “ system be at Karachi, and not at Nushki; “(6) that the route from Yezd to Karachi be “ wd Bunder Abbas and thence along the sea- “ coast, subject to reconsideration as the “ result of actual survey ; “ (c) that concessions be obtained for branch “ lines— “ from Bunder Abbas or Chaibai to Regan, Bam, and Kerman ; “ (ii.) from Mohammerah to Hamadan , “ (iii.) from Mohammerah to Bunder Abbas “ via Khor Musa, Behbehan, and Shiiaz , “ (iv.) from Bush ire to Shiraz and Ispahan , “ (d) that both the main and the branch lines “ in Persian territory be international, Russia “ and Great Britain holding a preponderating “ share and Persia being admitted to “ participate ; “ (e) that the gauge of the line passing through “British territory and the British zone be “ different from that of the line in the Russian “ zone, and that the break of gauge be at “ Bunder Abbas on the limit of the British “ zone ; “(f) that in return for our co-operation in tne “ main project, Russia should pledge herself “ not to entertain or support, without coming “ to an understanding with Great Britain, any “ proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of * “ the Perso-Afghan border within the Russian “ or neutral zones/’ 46. The Government of India concurred gene rally in the Committee’s conclusions, except on the following points:— (1.) They saw no reason to treat as inter national any branch lines constructed by Russia or Great Britain in their respective zones, and wished to treat the proposed branch line from Bunder Abbas or Charbar to Kerman as a purely British project, t^ opposed to a line from Bushire to Shiraz, and thought a line from Shiraz to Ispahan would only be useful if the Trans-Persian Railway were to avoid the latter place. (3.) They considered that, if the Trans-1 ersiaii Railway was to be the counterpoise to the Bagdad Railway, the concession for a Mohammerah-Hamadan line should be obtained merely for ear-marking purposes, and not with a view to actual construc tion. If, however—they telegraphed .later—-the Trans-Persian Railway were to fall through, a Mohammerah-Khoremabad line would become of primary importance.

Gootchcoff, the Lord Mayor of “ Moscow, and his brother, M. A. Gootchcoff, the Speaker of the Luma, sympathise with the “ project. In view of the Moscovite objections, the “ Cabinet instructed the President of the Board of Trade to call a meeting for the purpose of inves- “ tigating to what extent the Russian commercial “ interests might be impaired by the construction “ of railways in Persia, and of finding out the best “ eventual compensations. The meeting took place “ in January, and the results were reported to the Cabinet by M. Timasheff. “ The Cabinet, after mature deliberation of this “ report, pronounced itself, as above mentioned, “ favourable to the project. “It is perfectly evident that in its official “ answer, addressed to the promoters of the enter- “ prise, the Cabinet could not give more substantial Attitude of Russian Government towards the Trans Persian Railway.

In forwarding this letter the Foreign Ofhce expressed a hope “that it maybe found possible “ for His Majesty’s Government to express them- “ selves as favourably towards the scheme as the “ Russian Government have done.” Copy was also received here of the following Despatch addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg :— “ Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. “ fNn 78 Foreign Office, „ sir 1 ; 14th March 1911. “ Count Benckendorff reminded me to-day “ that the Russian Government had expressed “ sympathy with the Trans-Persian railway proposal, “ ail d had said that they could not express a more “ definite opinion before having a project put “ before them by a “ Comite d’Etudes,” and Count “ Benckendorff pressed me as to whether the British “ Government could not say something sympathetic “ I asked whether the “ Comite d’Etudes ” would “ expect a guarantee. ^ . . . “ Count Benckendorff replied that the idea was “ that the Russian Government should promise “ them the profit on the transit through Russia of “ a ll goods for the Trans-Persian railway. This “ railway would bring increased traffic to the “ Russian lines in Russia, and the profit on this “ increase would amount to about 4,500,000 roubles- “ a year. This was something to begin with. “ 1 observed that, since M. Sazonow had been so “ positive that no guarantee could be given by the Russian Government for any Persian railway, I ffad assumed that the project could not make / much progress. But, nevertheless, we had lost no time in communicating with the Government “ of India.

The views of the India Office on the whole matter were communicated to the Foreign Office in a letter dated the 6th April 1911, which is printed as Appendix VI. . The letter raised the question— Why should “ India sacrifice all the strategical advantages of “ her geographical isolation in order to encourage “ a scheme which, whatever prospect of profit it “ may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to Views of the India Office.

That the actual construction and working of the section in the British sphere must be “ entirely in British hands.” (o.) That British capitalists would not entertain the scheme unless there is a Government guarantee “ in some form or another.” A decision on this point _ might be deferred, but it was observed that, if the frontiers of India w r ere made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway construction, her claims upon the Imperial Exchequer would be strong. Subject to these remarks the Secretary of State agreed with the Government of India, and suggested that the assent of His Majesty’s Government should be given to the scheme of the Trans-Persian Rail way in principle, and that application should be made for concessions for blocking purposes as soon as the situation in Persia should permit. It w r as not thought that the scheme for a Trans- Persian Railway would survive an examination by experts. Further particulars as to scheme for Trans-Persian Railway. Sir G. Buchanan’s Despatch No. 112, 18th April 1911. Pol. 3467/11. 49. Shortly after the issue of this letter, Sir G. Buchanan reported, on the 18th April, that two of the promoters of the Trans-Persian line had informed him that the Russian group was now constituted, and had given him a confidential state ment, embodying the result of further investigations by engineers and others, in which the length of the railway across Persia was calculated at 1,400 miles, the building expenditure (including rolling stock), at 18,700,0000, or even at so low a figure as 15,000,0000, and the annual net revenue at 709.0000 The surplus net revenues that would be gained by Russian railways from the freights brought them by the new railway were valued at 460.0000 a year, and these, together with similar revenues from Indian railways, would, it was hoped, be available for the purposes of an indirect guarantee that would be more than sufficient to make up the difference between the sum of 709,0000 above-mentioned, and the sum of 1,200,U000, which would be required to satisfy the interest of the share and bond holders. Further investigations, it was said, ought to be carried on by a special company or syndicate (snciete d'etud.es), the formation of which would be the next step, dependent on the British attitude. Some further observations were added as to the general, and political advantages of the line, and inter alia, it F 346 was observed that it would strongly compete with a Khanikin-Tehran railway. 50. On the 10th May 1911, the Foreign Office addressed a despatch to Sir 0 . Fuchanan, instructing him to inform the Russian Government that His Majesty’s Government were ready to assent in principle to a Trans-Persian Railway, and to agree to the initiation of negotiations between its pro moters in this country and in Russia, subject to the following conditions :— “1. The line shall enter the British sphere “ at Bunder Abbas instead of at Kerman, subject “ to reconsideration as the result of actual survey, “ and shall in any case join the Indian railway “ system at Karachi and not at Aushki. 2. There shall be a break of gauge at Bunder “ Abbas, or wherever the line enters the British “ sphere of influence in Persia. “3. In return for the co-operation of Great “ Britain in the project, which examination has “ shown to be likely to benefit Russia far moie “ than Great Britain or India, Russia shall pledge “ herself not to entertain or support, without “ coming to an understanding with Great Britain, “ any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of “ the Perso-Afghan frontier within the Russian or “ neutral sphere in Persia. “ 4. Russia shall support demands made by “ Great Britain of the Persian Government _ for “ concessions of the following branch lines “ connected with the proposed Trans-Persian “ Railway :— “ (a) From Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with “ a branch to port to be constructed at Instructions to Sir G.

Absolute equality of treatment in all respects shall be guaranteed to British and British-Indian “ trade passing over the line and its branches. Sir G. Buchanan was to be at liberty to explain frankly that the first three of these conditions were dictated by strategic considerations, and had been inserted m the interest of India. He could further make it clear that His Majesty’s Government gxpj’csscd no opinion as to the commercial or financial aspects of the question.

Letter of Foreign Office to War Office, 15th May 1911. Pol. 3556/11. 51. Before the issue of the despatch to Sir G. Buchanan the War Office had forwarded to the Foreign Office a memorandum by General Sir W. Nicholson, Chief ^ of the General Staff,' dated the 26th April 1911, in which he expressed doubt as to the commercial advantage of railway construction m Southern Persia, a country consisting to a large extent of mountains and deserts. Sea-carriage would, he remarked, be always cheaper than car riage by land, and the climate of the Gulf and coast was a serious obstacle to railway communi cation. The protection of the railway between Bunder Abbas and Karachi would necessitate an increase in our naval force in the Gulf and the distribution of a military force along the line. The suggested construction of a fortress and the em ployment of warships to guard a railway were matters that were open to argument. From a naval and military point of view he considered that it would be folly to add to our responsibilities with the object of benefiting and tranquilising Southern Persia. In reply the Foreign Office remarked that the commercial value of a line debouching at Bunder Abbas seemed to have been somewhat underrated by Sir W. Nicholson. Tiiey refrained from dis cussing the measures that might become necessary for defending the line, if built, and explained that the reasons that had weighed in their consent to refer the question of the Trans-Persian Railway to a “ Comite d’etudes ” were that the construction of such a line could not be indefinitely resisted, and that, if constructed, it should follow the route preferred by the Indian Government.

As regards the Trans-Persian Railway, there is, at the time of writing, nothing more to be added to this memorandum. It remains to describe what action has been taken by His Majesty’s Government so far as concerns a concession for a line from Mohammerah to the north. The importance of our obtaining such a con cession was strongly represented to the Russian Government, and Sir G. Buchanan explained on one occasion to the Acting Foreign Minister that, now that Russia was about to admit German goods to the very heart of her zone, it was hardly fair not to allow British goods even to reach its gates,— the new line would only serve to carry goods that now passed into Persia by the Bagdad route, the value of which was about 1,000,COOL The Russian Government at first demurred and in conversation with Sir G. Buchanan, the head of the Persian Department informed him that Russia wanted a railway from Julfa to Tabriz on strate gical as well as commercial grounds, but did not desire its immediate prolongation to Khoremabad since the southern portion would be open to Tur kish attack. In the end the Russian Government withdrew their objection to our applying for an option to construct the Mohammerah-Khoremabadline with, a port at Ivhor Musa, taking act at the same time of the declaration of His Majesty s Government that at present it was only a question o securing a concession, and that before proceeding with the construction of the line it was proposed to enter into a friendly exchange of views with the Russian Government. .

The good offices of His Majesty’s Government would, it was hoped, be exerted to encourage a syndicate to come forward.S. 47. G 49 Sir G.

Cox suggested to His Majesty’s Minister, in a telegram dated the 17th March last, that the line might terminate at Dizful. Three years would probably, he thought, be sufficient to build the line, 1 and, with a good road on to Sultanabad, we might Pol. 694/11. maintain our hold in the markets of Khoremabad, Hamadan, Sultanabad, and that neighbourhood, even though the Khanikin-Tehran and Tehran-Yezd lines were built.

As regards what was said ot: a scheme for general railway construction in Persia, it may here be explained that a proposal for a scheme of this kind (of which the Trans-Persian Railway should form a part) had already been suggested by the Regent in conversation with Mr. Greenway and in a confidential message to His Majesty’s Minister, in which it was added that, to be palatable to the Persians, any railway scheme had better be of an international character, for example Russo-British- French. In a telegram of the 24th March, Sir G. Barclay similarly reported that, though the Persians realised the necessity for railway con struction, they were haunted by the fear that a railway concession might eventually give a pretext for foreign intervention. In reply to the Regent’s message above referred to, Sir G. Barclay informed him of his readiness to enter on a joint discussion with His Highness and the Russian Minister on the subject of railway construction in Persia.

On receipt of the Persian Government’s note (paragraph 54), it was decided, in consultation with Sir G. Barclay, to inform them that His Majesty Government, appreciated their point of view in not wishing to give to a foreign Government an option for a railway in Persia, but at the same time to ask for a written assurance that the Persian Government would negotiate with a private British syndicate when they wished to construct the Mohammerah, or any other southern line. “His Majesty’s Government would entirely stand aside.” It was explained to Sir G. Barclay that Mr. Greenway, the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Persian Transport Company would be informed that the field was clear for them to negotiate. Sir G. Buchanan was instructed on the 9th May to inform the Russian Government of the substance of the Persian reply to our application, as well as of the rejoinder made to them. This he did on the 10th idem.57 The Persian Transport Company, it may here be observed, had some little time previously expressed concern at reported negotiations of the oil syndicate in regard to a railway m Bout western Persia, and recalled the assurances they Xemselves held from the British Governmen for preferential treatment. Ihey were told, replv that, while His Majesty s Government depre cated for the moment applications for railway con cessions by the Company, or anyone else, they would not lose sight of the assurances given.' ^ On the 10th May 1911 the Company reminded the Foreion Office of the reply that had been made to them and forwarded copy of a telegram received irmnthffir Agent at Tehran to the effect that the International Oriental Syndicate were about to offer to construct a railway to Khoremabad fiom Mohammerah, a loan for the purpose to be secured on the railway, and no consideration to be given by the Persian Government to other otters. 58 In reply to an enquiry from the Foreign Office Sir G. Barclay telegraphed that commu nications had in fact been passing between the Persian Government and Mr. Osbornes syndicate for the construction of a Julfa-Mohammerah line, and that he had reminded the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Osborne that the scheme proposed would he impossible without Russian consent. His language was approved by Sir E. Grey, who considered that matters should be allowed to take their course and that he (Sir G. Barclay) should stand aside, in view of the under taking to the Persian Transport Company. 59. In a later telegram Sir G. Barclay further reported that the Russian Minister at Tehran had been approached by Colonel Beddoes on behalf of Messrs. Seligman, as to the construction of a JuJia- Mo hammer ah line by an Anglo-Franco-Russian syndicate or some syndicate acceptable to iuissia and Great Britain. Position of Persian Transport Company.

By the route he recommends this section would be 104 miles Iona- and would cost about 5(J0,000h 01. lor the sake of completeness mention may here be made of a scheme advocated by Mr. Chick, Commercial Adviser to His Majesty’s Consul- breneral at Bushire, in a memorandum on the subject^ of trade routes in Southern Persia, for a Motor Iransport service between Bushire and Shiraz by the Firuzabad route. Colonel Cox was disposed to favour the suggestion, but a necessary preliminary to carrying it out was to have a survey made of the route, and no action in this direction was at first taken. The Foreign Office, however, expressed the view that the project was worthy of examination, and the Government of India were asked for their opinion. They replied on the 16th June to the effect that they preferred to defer a decision regarding the survey until more advance had been made in the general question of railways in Persia. Colonel Cox is inclined to think that the Bushire-Shiraz trade artery and the harbour at Bushire may remain of some importance. Mr. Chick’s idea was that the service might be undertaken by the group supported by the Indo- European Telegraph Company, who have proposed to obtain a similar concession for the Bunder A bbas-Kerman road (see paragraph 29). 62. It remains to supplement in certain respects what has been said in this Memorandum regarding the attitude of the Russian Government towards railway construction in Persia. The important negotiations referred to in paragraph 40, as to a junction at Khanikin, the attitude of Germany, Ac., were interrupted by M. Sazonovv’s illness, and were reported by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg (31st May) to be still unfinished. It is known, however, that the provisions of the draft Russo-German Agreement have undergone modification in certain particulars. The efforts of His Majesty’s Government mean while have been directed towards urging the Russian Government not to part with their control of a line from Khanikin towards Tehran, or, in the alternative, to arrange for its internationalisation. The appre hension has, on more than one occasion, been expressed by Sir E. Grey lest such a line might be used by the Turks for aggressive purposes. 63. The Russian Government have throughout been greatly handicapped by the financial difficulty. The Duma, it was explained by M. Sazonow on oiie occasion, will never sanction a guarantee for rail ways in Persia, while they are so much needed in the interior of Russia, and the Russian Government have consequently been very anxious to secure British capital for their lines of railway in the north of Persia. The difficulty of inducing British capital to invest in Persian railways without some guarantee52 lias been pointed out to them, and emphasis has been laid on the impossibility of inducing such capital to do for Russian trade in the north what we cannot induce it to do for British trade in the south. His Majesty’s Government have, however, given the Russian Government an assurance that, m the event of Russia making a line from Julfa to join the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway, they will consider how far it would be possible to encouiage British capital to share in the enterprise. The Russian Government have also been told that, if they can interest British capital in a line they desire to construct from Enzeli to lehran, there would not be any objection on the part of His Majesty s Government,—indeed, on the understanding that the Russian Government would not oppose a line from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, His Majesty s Government would give every encouragement to such a project. _ . Besides the Enzeli-Tehran line, the Russians have, in contemplation a line from Julfa to Tabreez. They desire this for strategical, as well as com mercial, reasons. Sir E. Grey’s telegram to Sir G.

Extract (paragraph 2^ to end) from Minute on Seistan by the Viceroy (Lord Curzon), dated Ith September 189'), enclosed in Foreign Department, Seciet, Letter ol the Oovernment of India. No. 175, 21st September 1899. Pol. 927/99. F 22. Ihere remains only to he considered the question of a possible railway connection between India and Seistan. This question has been discussed at intervals during the past 12 years, and the history of the discussion is not without its lessons for the future. The first idea of some such railway appears to have originated with the late 8ir J. Browne, who, as early as 1884, advocated a line from the neighbour hood of Quetta via Nushki, not to Seistan, but to Safar, on the Helmand. This proposal was put forward, without any reference to Persia, for strategical reasons, namely, in order to prevent, at any future period, a Russian advance upon Kandahar. It is interesting to me to learn from a study of the papers what I did not know before, viz., that five years later, when I was travelling in Persia, and was first writing about this question, it had just been raised both in India and in Persia by a report from Colonel Bell, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department in India, who, in the autumn of 1888, marched from India by Kharan and Mashkel to Seistan, and strongly recommended the construction of a railway and a lease in perpetuity of Seistan from the Persian Government, with a view to the grant of a great irrigation concession to Reuter or to some other Company. The suggestion was eagerly taken up by Sir H. I). Wolff, whose imagination was at that time suffused with halcyon dreams of a regeneration of Persia Toy universal railways, and was recommended by him both tc the Government of India and to Lord Salisbury. Lord Lansdowne’s Government, in a telegram dated the 20th January 1889, said that “ railway extension through Baluchistan was regarded by the military autho rities as a most valuable adjunct to the defences of India, and as deserving of the utmost encouragement.” Sir H. Wolff’s proposals did not make much advance, but were reiterated by him in despatches to the Foreign Office, dated the 25th July and 19th August 1890. Unfortunately in these, as in his original despatch of the 19th February 1889, Sir. H. Wolff rested his defence of the scheme upon extremely contentious and entirely unacceptable grounds. He advocated it for two reasons ; as a menace to the Transcaspian Railway of Russia, and as the saving of a long land march in the event of our desiring to take the offensive against that power. This line of argument was completely riddled in a memorandum, dated the 2nd October 1890, by General Brackenbury, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a single line to a remote corner of Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia in that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border or in Afghan-Turkestan, and would be of no use for assuming the offensive. He concluded by saying: “By far the more important task is not the “ construction of a new line to Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by “ bringing the frontier tribes under our influence, and by developing Baluchistan “ and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia.” 23. General Brackenbury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his own argument was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a G 3Seistan railway would be not to attack l^^X^ft^do^reUher'by^ line Southern Persia from falling into her giasp, ’u , from Quetta, or, as he would himself prefer, by a line fiom the sea. 24. General Brackenbury’s criticism was sent out to tho 9^The and was thus noted upon by Sir G. ^e-ey on ^ ^ : 7's iripS* rifr. i« a. . r “ will also be found necessary. 25. A little later Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member m Indm a gam noted upon the scheme, and it is ^p^'^aUmld only objected to former opinion. He now explained (2/tti April ioji; indi ue j j a Seistaif railway so long as the Russian railway did not extend som ^ R ^ Caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Se Russia should take make extensions “ But if circumstances should change and it Russia snouia ra e “the ““making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to “ follow her lead. We ought to be able to keep pace with her. ••&gt;6 These conditions had not yet been realised and the Government of India decided to proceed no further with the scheme. The question of a more sou the y ine from the sea was at the same time considered m connection with Sir R- Sandeman’s proposals to take over Kej and Panjgur—a project which was rev ived m 1894 by his Successor, Sir J. Browne. On both occasions, however (as again at a later date) the proposal to assume administrative responsibility for Makian v negatived by the Government of India, and with it the idea of a Makran railway from X sea to Seistan was dropped also. Since then the question has not been revived. 27 It will be clear from tbe above narrative, firstly, that the idea of a Seistan railway does not appear to have ever been considered by the Government of India from the only point of view in which, in my opinion, it ought to be regarded wz as a protective and not an offensive, measure. The reason perhaps is tnat, at that Bine Russia had not given such unmistakable evidence of her intention to move southward from Meshed, and to draw Seistan within the radius of her political influence. The railway was accordingly discussed and condemned, as a means of attacking Russia in Northern Persia, not as a means of keeping Russia ouQ ol Southern Persia. Moreover, at that time, the Quetta-Seistan trade route not having yet been opened, the possible commercial value of the line was not taken into account at all. Secondly, it will be noticed that the conditions postulated by Sir H Brackenbury in London as precedent to any idea of railway construction m .his quarter have since been realised. Baluchistan is rapidly being developed, the frontier tribes have passed completely under our control, a permanent line oi communication with Seistan has been opened, while the very conditions which he said when in India, might compel a change of attitude on our part, viz, Russian initiative in the process of southerly extension from her existing lailua} system, have been fulfilled by the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us of the Merv-Kushk line. It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied, and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28 Ls regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line might'be confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the Report m 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “No one who has traversed this country can fail to be T struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nushki and “ S e i s tan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle “ ex i s ts to bar the road ; throughout the gradient is exceedingly gentle ; bands of “ sand can as a rule be avoided ; of fuel there is an abundance , while not a bridge “ of more than one span, or engineering work of any magnitude, is requisite. Added “ t0 this, the mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hills to the west, at present “ lying untouched, is so considerable as in itself to offer very great inducements to “ railway enterprise. Such a railway would place the trade of Lastei n I ersia and “ Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give us a « preponderating influence in Eastern Persia, and open to India the rich grain fields “ of Seistan.”55 ..... It ttould appear, therefore that so far as gradients, water-crossings, and fuel are concerned, little or no difficulty would be met with in laying a line across the 400 and odd miles that intervene between Nushki and Seistan. On the other hand l am inclined to think that at present a very serious obstacle would present itself in the complete dearth of water over long stretches of this route, and in the problem of the shifting sands. Both of these difficulties have been overcome by Russia thoudi on y at great expense, and with the aid of a large permanent staff, upon her Iranscaspian Railway She has had, moreover, the assistance of a settled population and the advantage of numerous inhabited sites along the railway line. These advantages would, at any rate, at the start be wanting in the case of a Quetta-Seistan railway, for some time the trade by such a line, though it would probably develop with great rapidity, would not be remunerative ; while the railwav would have no other immediate use, inasmuch as it would not be a line of connection between important centres of population, industry, or arms, but would, so to speak end in the air II it stopped at the Anglo-Persian border, it would still be 90 miles distant from JNasnabad, the capital of Seistan. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to be problematical in view of the engagements against the introduction ol railways which Persia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia. The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would be required to pronounce, although, in the yearly increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggested the desirability of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres of interest m Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone. In such a case there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promotion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day when, the Helmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing outpost on the flanks of British India that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracticable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these, I am yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso- Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles), and such an extension would afford im inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing, and where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few davs’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which 1 am recommending, in connection with the trade route before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas,^ the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. APPENDIX II. (Referred to in paragraph IS.) RUSSIA AND THE PERSIAN GULF. Extract (paragraph 12 to end) from Minute by the Viceroy (Lord Curzon), dated 28th October 1901, enclosed in Foreign Department, Secret, Letter of the Government of India, No. 183, 7th November 1901. (P 176) Pol. 1376/01. ; 12. The subject is two-fold, commercial and political. By the efforts of our traders during the past century we have built up a commerce (in the main from India) with the ports of the Persian Gulf and with the cities of Southern and Central and even of Northern Persia, which possesses an annual value of several millions G 4 Vsterling. It is not too much to say that “Sfatorptirom^a t-Rnsst southern zone we sttll monopol.se it ^-^Tthis trade-at least in InlVfoUow :iit ; e and a ^stlrn of'carefully W0 ' ld ’ “ 3 ^ time, deprive India of one of her best and most lucrative maikets. 13 These considerations are sufficiently serious. ^ The political ones are more sa fcass; t“ o:'; o s ii^iglSliisS— posts aid garrisons to guard what would then have become a vulnerable, though it is now a negligible, section of the Indian border. 14. The Minute which I wrote on 4th September 1899 and sent W India Office with the Government of India s Despatch of -1st P &gt; sufficientlv indicated the extreme strategical importance to India of Seistan. The sufficiently momateu i since made t0 deve lo p the trade success that has attended the o»orts wmc^ ^ trade having ris en in two rears from d to 15 lakhs —has tended to increase both our interest and our influence fn'hat rdon of the Shah’s dominions, and has encouraged us to project the early m inai puiuui u e ^ tn Nnshki te over the first 90 miles ot the ^rTLlian railway through Seistan to the Gulf-followed as it must be by the political absorption of Seistan—would not merely kill this promising enterprise, Ind closrL one Remaining overland trade route (that to Yarkand and Kashgar is already nearlv dead) that still remains open to Indian commerce, but it w ould ha-ve the following^further and even more serious consequences. It would place Russia control of a district ethnographically connected with Baluchistan, would pro foundly affect our prestige both with Afghan and Baluch, and would greatly enhance the difficulties that we already experience m managing the cognate tribes 011 1 G Indian side of the border. If Great Britain is ever called upon to advance to Kandahar as she will probably one day be compelled to do, an intolerable state of friction would arise between the Powers that would then control the upper and the lower waters of the Helmund. Moreover, while Seistan, if it ever fell under British influence, could, owing to the protecting floods upon the north, be easily ( Kdendec against Russian attack from the direction of Meshed our present frontier .should Seistan pass into the hands of Russia), being entirely exposed, would enjoy no similar immunity. I might easily enlarge at greater length upon the strategical importance to India of Seistan. But as I believe it to be now general y recognized hoth here and in England, it wall be sufficient to say that a Russian railw ay throng 1 Eastern Persia to the Persian Gulf means neither more nor less than the final loss to Great Britain of Seistan : and that the recent declarations of the British Government as to our interests in that quarter forbid me to believe that they would acquiesce m any such calamity. For my own part, if Persia were to hypothecate to Russia the revenues of Seistan (a move which has recently been under contemplation, but which I should regard as not less insulting to ourselves than would be to Russia the hypothecation of the revenues of Meshed to Great Britain), or to cede to Russia a commanding political position on that section oi the border 1 should not hesitate to advise that the Persian Government be compelled to cancel the arrangement. Such a peril can, however, be more opportunely averted by a plain declaration of our views and intentions in advance, than by threats or military movements afterwards. 15. Should a Russian naval port be constructed in the Gulf, and should a Russian fleet (most likely in connection with the French) be^ called into existence in the Indian Ocean, it is impossible, either for the protection of our trade, or lor57 the safety of our own shores, that we could remain content with the existing strength of the East India squadron. We should have to place the ports on the eastern coasts of India in a state of more finished defence than is at present the case. Our military and naval responsibilities would be more than doubled in that direction. 16. The question would next arise how far Russia would find it compatible with her newly acquired political ascendency, that the main lines of telegraphic communi cation between Great Britain and India should run through Persian territory or beneath the waters of the Persian Gulf. Even if she were ready to leave them intact, should we be prepared to acquiesce in the control, at a time of emergency, of these lines by a foreign and probably a hostile power ? 17. It has been argued that, if Russia cannot in prudence be allowed a port at the south-eastern end of the Persian Gulf, owing to its close proximity to Indian shores, and its patent challenge to Indian interests, we need entertain no such scruples about a port nearer to the upper end. As I have previously argued, a commercial port, as the terminus of a commercial railway, may be rendered equally innocuous anywhere in the Gulf. But if it is to be a political port, and the terminus of a political railway, then it is equally objectionable wherever it be placed, and the mere geographical distance of a few hundred miles, or one or two days steam, makes no difference in the situation, Political control over Southern Persia, can equally be disseminated from lines terminating at Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, or Charbar. Whichever be the naval base, the ships that lie there can equally menace Indian commerce, Indian shipping, and Indian interests. Moreover, while at the near end of the Gulf a Russian railway to the sea would have the drawbacks already mentioned of invading the British sphere of interest in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan, of destroying British influence in those regions, and of directly menacing the British-protected territories of the Khan of Kalat—a Russian railway to the upper end, c.p., to Mohammerah on the Karim, would similarly traverse a region (that inhabited by the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes) in which British influence has hitherto remained uncontested, and where British enterprise has establised an adventurous and successful foothold, and would terminate in a port which is owned by an Arab Sheikh whose family has been uniformly friendly to the British power, and which commands the main channel of the Shat-el-Arab or combined estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates. To concede such a position to Russia would place the approach to Baghdad within her power, and would extinguish the influence of Great Britain in Turkish Arabia. 18. The international aspect of the acquisition by Russia of a port at either end of the Persian Gulf cannot be ignored. Such an incident could not possibly stand alone. Under instructions from the Home Government we have recently submitted to them plans for counter-action in such a contingency, involving the seizure of certain Persian islands or harbours, in self-protection and retaliation, by ourselves. But neither would the action be confined to Russia and Great Britain. I ranee and Germany would unquestionably appear upon the scene. The disastrous contagion of Kiao-ehow would be reproduced ; and the Persian Gulf—for 100 years, so far as political predominance is concerned, a British lake—would become a second Gulf of Pechili, to be quarrelled over and parcelled out by the greed of rival Powers. This is no fanciful picture of the imagination. It is an indisputable deduction from the circumstances of the case. 19. Finally, let me contemplate the effect that would be produced by the concession of a Persian railway and a Persian port to Russia upon the general problem of Indian defence. A glance at the map will show that India would then be surrounded in a ring fence by Russia and her ally. Following this line from W est to East I have already shown the position at which Russia aims as threatening the entire western borders of Baluchistan and Afghanistan from the 1 ersian Gulf to Herat. Herat itself could be taken by the Russians in less than three weeks. From Herat to the Oxus the Afghan frontier is it the mercy of the Russian forces. The course of the &lt; )xus from Charjui to the Pamirs is now under their control. They can cross it at any point at any time without our knowledge and without the possibility of interruption. We are obliged even now to keep a close watch upon the northern passes of the Hindu Kush. East of the 1 ainns, the Russians have already taken up a position in the Taghdumbash Pamir, which will presently make their frontier adjacent to our own on the Mustagh Range. I he fall oi Kashgar and Chinese Turkistan is absolutely certain and cannot very much longer be delayed, s. 47. HTibet will still intervene between Russian territory and ° ur °!™ admission from already rumours o£ a 1 ^^ tt of“ritieh Burm a^we ermounter 'the nW^Mt^d'^ influence of France, whose Lt^om Imp^^^ln ** with the territories, and confronted with the ambitions, oi ioweis are on the whole inimical to its own. In such a case-and it is no ihle aream o f® ° “ the future will show-we shall not be able to move, to strike, to a d v a nce in any part of the world where French or Russian interests are involved because’of the menace that will stand perpetually at our Indmn doom Of the Strain upon Indian finances, I do not at present speak: but it wou d be altogether of onr means. In this ring fence there are at piesent three g P • still independent kingdom of Siam on the east, the portion of whose territories lying nearest to thrindian frontier has beeu guaranteed by a Convention between Croat Bn tat and France; on the north the upland wilds of alien intrusion ; and on the west the dominions of the . Rritaitfrt her remaining buffers that separate the Asiatic possessions of Great Britain trom nei Furopean rivals. It rests with British statesmanship to retain all three intact But it wi/l sacrifice the most important of their number if it knowingly concedes to Russia that gratilication of her ambition in Eastern Persia, the consequences of vtocb to the British Empire it has been been the object of tins Minute to expose. APPENDIX III. (Referred to in paragraph 21.) Extract from the Anglo-Russian Convention of 31st August 1907. Arrangement regarding Persia.

Pol. 3970/08. His Majesty’s Grovernment have examined with much interest and careful attention the aide-memoire communicated by the Russian Government to His Majesty s Ambassador at St. Petersburg on the 2nd (15th) August on the subject of railway construction in Persia. Some misapprehension appears to have arisen in regard to the precise nature of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, who, m approaching the Russian Government, contemplated not actual construction, but rather timely co-operation in ear-marking Concessions which otherwise might be exploited to the detriment of Great Britain and Russia. His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance to a complete under standing witli the Russian Government on this question. They consider, however, for reasons which will be indicated forthwith, that any Convention now concluded by the two Powers with the Persian Government should be of a protective character, and calculated to assure to Great Britain and Russia a secure position as regards enterprises involving political issues whenever the time is ripe for construction. Apart from the uncertainty of the political situation, there are many factors, now unknown quantities, which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, render impracticable, in existing circumstances, any definite scheme of railway development in Persia, such, for instance, as the absence, at any rate in Southern Persia, of all surveys, even of a preliminary character, as the.ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and as the question of whether or not a branch line is constructed from Bagdad to Khanikin. Many developments of this nature must be awaited before a railway from Julia to Mohammerah can be built with adequate prospects of commercial success. Moreover, the principal obstacle to railway construction in the immediate future is undoubtedly to be found in the governing consideration of cost, and in the difficulty of securing the necessary capital. The Russian aide-memoire emphasizes the inability of the Persian Government to meet the requisite expenditure, and the reluctance of the Russian Ministry of Finance to afford pecuniary assistance for this purpose. His Majesty’s Government on their part are fully persuaded that no projects of railway enterprise in Persia in the present economic and political condition of the country would be sufficiently attractive to induce British capitalists to select them as a field for investment ; while His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest where the risk involved would be difficult to estimate, but undoubtedly considerable. His Majesty’s Government find some difficulty in appreciating the full inwardness of the suggestion contained in the Russian aide-memoire that the question of an important external loan is intimately connected with that of a Railway Concession., and should be dealt with simultaneously. If it is considered that a loan should be made to Persia on more favourable terms than would otherwise be the case, in return for the grant of a Railway Concession, then an addition must be made pro tanto to the cost of constructing the railway. . His Majesty’s Government are not convinced that such procedure would be financially expedient, and they incline to the belief63 that it would tend to simplicity if these distinctive operations were to be considered upon their respective merits. As regards the question of an external loan, a comprehensive despatch, of which tl le substance will shoitlv be communicated to the Russian Government by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!, has recently been received from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the subject of the actual financial position of the Persian Government. Mr. Marling, after reviewing the principal aspects of the question, arrives at the conclusion that the resources of the Persian State are, if properly administered, amply sufficient to enable necessary expenditure to be covered by existing revenue and he expresses his conviction that any large advance made to the Persian Govern ment from abroad might, in the long run, aggravate rather than effectually relieve the present financial stress. His Majesty’s Government consider that the efforts of Great Britain and Russia should be directed to impressing upon the Persian Government that the real interests of the Btate imperatively demand a policy of retrenchment and financial reform , that such reform must constitute the bed-rock of all economic progress and commercial prosperity ; and that, as a preliminary step in the desired direction, the Persian authorities should make it their first aim to afford the Financial Inspector full support and loyal co-operation. It is, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, only upon the establishment of financial equilibrium in the Persian Budget that the question of actual railway construction in the country can be faced with due regard to the elementary principles of commercial prudence. This construction should, they consider, be carried out under such conditions that a minimum rate of interest upon the capital involved would be secured, without the risk of defalcation, by the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that, in view of the important political interests at issue, Great Britain and Russia would be fully justified in informing the Persian Government that, in the event of railway communications being established in Persia, they would expect to have the refusal, upon terms equally favourable to any offered by third parties, of all Concesssions which might be in contemplation. His Majesty’s Government are well aware of the existence of the Russo-Persian understanding which precludes the grant of any Railway Concession in Persia before November 1910. A somewhat similar arrangement is in force between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government whereby, in the event of railway construction being undertaken north of Tehran, a Concession for a railway in the south would forthwith be accorded to a British Company. His Majesty’s Government would suggest that these Agreements might well be made the basis of a further communication to the Persian Government, and at the same time the British and Russian Governments might intimate the lines to which they respectively attach especial importance. The Russian Government have already acquainted His Majesty’s Government with their views on this aspect of the question. His Majesty’s Government, on their part, besides the southern section of a line which may be built from Julfa to Mohammerah, would specify, as the Concessions which most closely concern them, the lines Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to Ahwaz, with the option to construct a port at Khor Musa. It is stated in the Russian aide-memoire that the lines in the Russian sphere should serve to maintain and develop Russian interests (a) by the chronological order in which they are built, and (b) by adjustment of Tariff rates on the Moham merah Railway. His Majesty’s Government consider that the drawbacks, in existing circumstances, of entering into detail as to the adjustment of Tariff rates, the allotment of shares, or the constitution of the Board of Control, are obvious, and they submit that any attempt to settle these matters would be premature and likely to lead to future embarrassment. However far they might be prepared to meet the Russian Govern ment in regard to the order in which the several lines may be built (a point which may well be reserved for subsequent consideration), they cannot but feel that it would be well-nigh impossible, if the Mohammerah Railway is to be worked on a commercial basis, to assent to anything that could be regarded as a discrimination of Tariff rates in favour of Russian goods. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government, animated by a spirit of sincere friend ship towards the Russian Government, and impressed with the importance of H 464 .voiding any action winch ,nay prejudice the b-eMal developtne^ of comn.ercial tnd political relations between the two 0 °' to^ expres ^ ^ Slntoa^tioftet^inevoid of difficulty if this question were ho he Drematurely brought into piominence.

India Office, 6th April 1911. S ‘ r ’ I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter marked confidential, of the 20th instant, regarding the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, and to forward, for the f or Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter, No. 18, Secret, dated 2drd February uii, an d enclosures, that has been received from the Government of India on the same SUbj The communication from the Russian promoters apiiem's t ( &gt; ad&lt; 1 not 1' ing 1 *&gt; the information conveyed in Sir G. Buchanans Despatch No. 29 of 31st Januai&gt; last, except the fact that they seem to think themselves justified by the attitude of t e Russian Government in proceeding with the scheme. That attitude is described by the Russian Government themselves as follows : “ The council was generally favourable to the proposal brought forward by the promoters of the enterprise that a special commission (‘ societe d etudes ) should be instituted for a preliminary study of the question on the under standing, however, that the realisation of the scheme shall not involve loss to the Russian Treasury or damage the economic interests of Russia. “ The decision of the Council of Ministers on this subject will take final shape as soon as the Ministries interested have arrived at an agreement. And it has been added in conversation that the only financial support that the enterprise would receive from the Russian Government would be a certain share m any surplus profits that might accrue to the State railways from increased receipts due to the transit traffic in goods and passengers through Russia. Sir F. Grey expresses the hope that it may be possible for His Majesty’s Government to adopt an attitude towards the scheme not less favourable than that ol the Russian ^ ° It will be seen from the Government of India’s letter and the papers enclosed therein that from the point of view of through traffic, whether of goods or passengers, a Trans- Persian railway such as that proposed is thought to have no prospects of financial success, and, further, that India can hope to derive from the development of local traffic no commercial advantage at all commensurate with that which Russia may expect. If this view is sound—and 1 am to say that Viscount Morley concurs generally in it—the question arises Why should India sacrifice all the strategical advantages of her geographical isolation in order to_ encourage a scheme which, whatever prospect of profit it may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to herself ? , 1 i • + i An indirect answer may perhaps be given to this question. It may be pointed out that with the advent of other Powers in Persia, seeking spheres of commercial if not of political expansion, the geographical isolation of India is necessarily doomed, and that it behoves those who are responsible for her interests to be foremost in the race for concessions, so as to ensure that such at least as may be strategically and politically essential to her security shall be in her own hands. One or more of these concessions would be for railway lines which, though their immediate purpose would be different, might, without disadvantage, form connecting links in a Trans- Persian railway.Lord Morley thinks that this is, on the whole, a reasonable answer. But certain corollaries appear to follow from it:— (!•• Whatever the alignment of the rest of the line, it is essential that that part of it which will be in the British sphere shall be determined solely with a^ view to Indian interests. The line must therefore, in Lord Morley’s opinion, enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas, and not at Kerman, and run along the coast at Karachi; and there must be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas. (2.) While the through line may be international as regards the financial interests admitted (and in this connection I am to observe that it will be neither possible nor desirable to exclude German capital), it is essential that the actual construction and working of the section in the British sphere should be entirely in British hands ; but there would be no objection to placing abroad contracts for a certain proportion of the materials and rolling stock. (3.) It is practically certain that British capitalists will not entertain the scheme unless there is a Government guarantee in some form or another. And this raises a very important and difficult question of principle. Before dealing with that I am to observe, on a point of detail, that the proposed Russian guarantee appears to be illusory. It is true that in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch, No. 78, to Sir G. Buchanan, dated 14th March, Count Benckendorff is reported to estimate the profit on increased traffic on Russian railways at 4,500,000 roubles (about 475,0000) a year. Lord Morley is unable to conjecture upon what data this estimate is based ; but it is obvious that, if the view taken above be correct, and the through traffic be not likely to pay, the increase of traffic in Russia itself must be of modest dimensions ; and if the Government of India’s Committee are correct in thinking that the Consortium have enormously over-estimated the gross earnings of the through line, the Russian Government’s “ guarantee fund ” will manifestly be inadequate. But whatever view Russian financiers may take of it, British financiers are likely to require from their own Government some more substantial consideration. Lord Morley is not aware what are Sir E. Grey’s views upon this subject, but it will be seen that the Government of India recommend that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain should be equally shared between the Indian and British exchequers. This recommendation will call for serious consideration in view of the heavy expenditure already borne by India in providing for the defence of her frontiers. If those frontiers are made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway extension, which Imperial policy and the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the European Powers force upon the acceptance of India, her claims upon the Imperial Exchequer will be strong. But at present the railway project is only under examination, and it is reasonable to defer a decision in regard to the guarantee until the conclusions of the experts have been received. Subject to these remarks his Lordship agrees with the Government of India, and would suggest that the assent of His Majesty’s Government should be given to the scheme in principle, and that application should be made for the concessions for blocking purposes, as soon as the situation in Persia permits. The project can then be examined in detail by an expert body similar to the Russian societe d'etudes. 1 am to add that Lord Morley is of opinion that it will not survive such an examination. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, The Dnder Secretary of State, R. Ritchie.

Teheran, M. le Ministre, 31st March 1911. It will doubtless not have escaped the memory of the Persian Government that in a rescript addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 16th September 1888, His Imperial Majesty Nasreddin Shah gave priority to His Majesty’s Government over others for the construction of a southern railroad and a positive assurance that no southern railway would be granted to any foreign company without consultation with His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government feel that the essential need for railway construction in Southern Persia, not only for the development of British trade with Persia but also for the prosperity of Persia herself, must be evident to the Persian Government. In particular it would seem of the first importance to establish a port at Khor Musa ami railway communication from that place northwards, and His Majesty’s Govern ment are therefore desirous of obtaining a concession for this enterprise. I am accordingly as a first step towards the realisation of the project in question instructed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to apply on behalf of His Majesty’s Government for an option from the Persian Government for a concession for a port at Khor Musa and for a railway northwards as far as Khoremabad with branch to Mohammerah, if found desirable. I feel confident that Your Excellency will realise that His Majesty’s Government, in making this application, are actuated as much by motives of friendship towards Persia as by concern for the interests of British trade, and that the Persian Govern ment will give it their favourable consideration, bearing in mind that the present application is for an option only, and that the details of the concession can be discussed subsequently.

Lord Ourzon, Persia and the Persian Question (1892), Vol. L, Oh. 18, pp. 613-639 ; also Ch. 9, pp. 235-244 (Seistan). To some extent what is here said, especially as to Seistan, should no doubt be considered as superseded by the later official minutes, Ac., ol Loid Ourzon, to which reference is made in the Memorandum. Attention may, however, be called to one or two passages of special interest. On the general geographical position Lord Curzon wrote (p. 613) : “ Every railway “ from the coast must perforce climb from the sea level to that of the elevated “ plateau, varying from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height, which constitutes the bulk of “ Persia, and upon which all the great cities are placed. The passes conducting to I 268 “ this plateau are commonly of great altitude P'^Xu^lu^Lffiemton “ cS 000 feet in height, and being as a rule so precipitous that even mute tratnc upi “ them isnof unattended with danger.

Of the prospects of (11), a Mohammerah-Buruprd-rd^ 1.^ he was much more sanguine, pointing out that there was a consensus of opinion that it was Z railway moft likedy to pay in Persia. Of (11), the Bagdad-Tehran Railway he wrote • “This line might he expected to do a considerable business, though it •‘wTuWbe a costly one to construct 1 , the ascent from the Chakkean plains to the ' Persian plateau being very steep and difficult. But neither in gooi s passenger traffic could it compete with the line last sketched nor would it tap the “ resources of so extensive a country, nor be so easily reached from the sea His conclusion as regards a Euphrates Valley railway, approaching Bagdad lit the Mediterranean, was that it “ did not for the present at any rate he within the “ domain of practical politics.” This opinion was based on physical, political, military, and economic grounds. A continuation of the line from the head of the Gulf by way of Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas 3ask, and Uwadur to Karachi, would fail, he said, even more conspicuously on the iour-ioid test t “ would be costly, absolutely unremunerative to Persia, and perilous to nealtn. Of a line from Bagdad along the Euphrates or Tigris Valley, and then mu Shuster Shiraz, and Bunder Abbas, along the Mekran Coast to Karachi he had no hi oh opinion. The true line of Trans-Persian railway communication would, Ire thought, be more to the north, uniting the great agricultural, manufacturing, an commercial cities of Persia. “Such a line is more likely to be found along the “ track Baghdad, Kermanshah, Burujird, Isfahan, Yezd, Kerman, which 1 believe “ to be the ultimate route of through communication by rail, in the far distant days “ when such a development becomes possible. \\ hat 1 have elsewhere said with “ reference to a Seistan railway will show how this scheme might connect with the “Indian railways, and how it would possess the further advantage, if ever “ constructed and brought into communication with Europe, of depositing the “ British soldier, not merely at Karachi, but on the Afghan frontier itself, and at “ the probable theatre of war.” If this line were ever realised, he thought connection with the Mediterranean would be effected by already existing railways m Asia Minoi.

Yate commented on the general desire of Russian officers in Central Asia to connect the Trans-Caspian Railway with the Indian railways at Herat. He did not himself see how such a line would pay or what goods would travel by it. Passengers would prefer the sea route via Marseilles. He did not see that India would gain anything except quicker mails. (HI.) Colonel Sir T. H. Holdich, K.C.M.G., Ac., The Indian Borderland (1901), pp. 219-224. T t • Sir T.

Writing (1902) before the progress of the Bagdad Railway, and the Russo- Japanese War Sir H. Norman said (page 256): “It is an absolutely determined u P art 0± b er y i - e - Russian) policy to have an outlet on the Persian Gulf—to carry ler south-western frontier to the warm water. With her present railway system , t however she does not feel strong enough to meet the opposition that this step—- practically the annexation of Persia—might provoke.” . A /f in (P a p. 257 ,) •' “ Pussia is extremely anxious to extend her railway system “ at r ntral rS a ’ fl) brmg her militar .y centres into direct connection with the u Afghan and 1 ersian frontiers, in view of possible hostilities with England ; (2) to u &amp; ® cu f e 7or berself the future railway trade-route between Europe and India, bv a () 'fcring a shorter and cheaper line before the alternative route via Bagdad is u constructed ; (3) by thus rendering the construction of this latter railway an j unprofitable undertaking, to remove the one fatal obstacle to an ultimate port for (( herself upon the I ersian Gulf; (4) to develop further her own Central Asian “ territories. From a Russian point of view the reasons are certainly convincing.” He next discussed a railway across Afghanistan from Merv and the Kushkinski post to New Cham an, and observed as follows (page 270)“ In the first place, such “ a junction is absolutely certain to come some day, but the time may be far off. [[ Second, if Russia were successful in a war against England, it would assuredly be u Hp b er conditions of peace. Third, a railway would give little advantage to “ Russia that it would not give to England, for if it would enable Russia to hurry troops toward India, it would equally enable England to hurry Indian troops “ t iward Central Asia, and the final advantage would thus be, as it always is in war, “ f 7 P je quickest to act. Fourth, it would do much to remove international “ niisunderstan ling, for it would bring intelligent and commercial Russians into u Judin, and a similar class of English and Anglo-Indians into Russia. Finally, will “ not the moment soon come, when two civilised nations will refuse to allow an “ uncivilised regime, friendly at heart to neither and only friendly in action to one “ of them so long as self-interest dictates such a course,* to stand in the way of one This was written before the death of the late Amir of Afghanistan.70 c i i 4 44 44 44 44 44 of those great advances of intercommunication, which are the chief signs and promoters 8 of civilisation? In view of these considerations, it can hardly be thought unreasonable for Russia to plan her Central Asian communications v it a view to their ultimate extension to Central India. He believed (page 218) that, “though much secrecy is observed upon the matter, the railway which Russia hopes to lay through Persia to the sea, the route of which has already been roughly surveyed, is intended to start on the froiitiei at Julfa, and run, via Ahar, to Tabriz, Tehran, Isfahan, and lezd, and past Bunder Abbas to the Indian Ocean.” Again (page 401), he wrote of “ the determination of Russia to secure at any cost “ the control of Persia and a naval and maritime outlet upon the Persian Cult, and (page 440) he stated his views in the following passage “ X gee no good reason in British interests why Russia should not develop I ersia as a market for her surplus manufactures, why she should not bring her goods and passengers to the sea through Persia, why she should not have a naval base m the Persian Gulf. But I see excellent reasons why she should not come down to the Persian Gulf and immediately extinguish British and Indian trade there, as she has virtually done in Central Asia, by the imposition of absolutely prohibitive duties If she would bind herself, by formal treaty, to admit all foreign goods to lersia and transport them upon Persian railways on precisely the same terms as Russian goods, she might, in my opinion, have Persia to-morrow, with all the vast advantage its possession would confer upon her.’ (V.) Lieutenant-Colonel A. C. Yate, The Proposed Persian Trans-Indian Railway. (Paper read before the Central Asian Society, 8th lebruary 1911). Colonel Yate thinks that in process of time three railway systems will be completed :—(1) Constantinople to Koweit, via Konia, Adana, and Bagdad ; (2) Baku, across Persia and Baluchis'an to the North-Western State Railway of India; (3) Russian Turkestan through Afghanistan to the North-Western Frontier of India. As regards (3), he considers that Afghanistan will in the long run have to reconsider its attitude towards railways, and that, if the Trans- Persian railway is constructed, Meshed and Herat, as well as Kerman and Kandahar, will ultimately be connected by rail. As regards (2) he prefers the name “ Indo-European to “ Trans-Persian.” He thinks it important that the “ internationality” of the line and its branches should be rigidly safe-guarded, and strongly criticises the Russian attitude in objecting on strategical grounds to a Turkish railway from Trebizond to Erzeroum, and thence to Tabriz, and to the special negotiations undertaken by Russia with regard to the Khanikin-Tehran line. He thinks there is something to be said for holding an international conference at which the Amir might be represented. As regards the trace of the Trans-Persian line, the country from Tehran to Kerman is not difficult, but from Kerman to Nushki the line would pass through the desert known as Dasht-i-Lut, and another to the west of Kharan ; also there are steep gradients from Nushki to Quetta, and again from Quetta to Sibi. Colonel Yate prefers, therefore, the line indicated in Sir T. Holdich’s book “ The Gates of India,” from Kerman, via Bampur to Panjgur. From Panjgur the line would pass through Quetta, Hindu Bagh, and the Gonial Pass to Lahore, if Calcutta is to be its objective ; and a branch might also be made from Panjgur to Karachi. He adds that, “ the ultimate issue of the Trans-Persian Railway may make “ northern India the halfway-house of a vast railway system connecting Central “ Europe with Central China.” Colonel Yate thinks it must be accepted that the jirimary aim of the Trans- Persian railway is political, but he believes that the line may be made commercially successful, and he thinks that the line will also strengthen Persia, and thus indirectly Great Britain. * In the discussion that followed4 I 4 ri General Sir E. Chapman supported the idea of a conference at which the Amir should be represented. Sir J. D. Rees considered an estimate of nearly 13,000Z. per mile (1 600 miles') excessive. ’ ' Lord Lamington said that the view seemed generally held that a line to India was an evil, but, if it were agreed that the line must be made, we should consider the route to be followed. Mr. G. Lloyd, M.P., spoke m favour of our supporting a railway from Damascus to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. Mr. Chirol pointed out, as regards the Trebizond-Tabriz line, that it might be made by a French company with Russian consent. He thought a Damascus-Persian Gulf line, supported by us, impracticable. e Colonel C. E. Yate, M.P., dwelt on the importance to us of the Sadiieh-Khanikin line. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch thought that the prospects of the Trans-Persian line were remote, since investors would require a Russo-British guarantee, and this the Russian Government would not give. Captain Macatday pointed out that there would have to be a break of gauge since the Russian gauge was 5 feet and the Indian standard gauge was 5 ft. 6 ins. The further north the break of gauge the better for us. “ There could be no “ question that strategically it would be a great advantage for us for the line to run “ fr oin Kerman via Bampur. This route would have the great value of being ‘‘ within the influence of our sea-power, and also not have the same flanking effect “ on our North-Western Frontier position that a Nushki line would have. We ;; should certainly stipulate that this should be the route of approach to India in the “ event of the Trans-Persian scheme materializing, and that we should also stipulate “ for construuction and control of any branch lines connecting the Trans-Persian Railway and the Persian Gulf. This would also be commercially advantageous, “ as P would give an opportunity of combining the longest sea-transport, and shortest land-transport.” Colonel A. C. Yate, in summing up, said that he was a strong advocate of strengthening the British naval force in Indian seas. (VI.) Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, Railways in the Middle East. (Paper read 1st March 1911 before Central Asian Society). Mr. Lynch treats the Trans-Persian Railway as part of the wider system of railways in the Middle East. Like Colonel A. C. Yate, he thinks we should have access to any such line by way of Trebizond and Erzeroum, and also the Persian Gulf. As regards the_ latter, he rejects a Bunder Abbas-Kerman line, at the threshold of the Gulf, in favour of one through the Karun Valley, which might be carried on to Ispahan. Dealing with the Bagdad Railway, he emphasises the strategical aspect of the line, quoting from a German writer, Dr. Rohrbach, to prove that Turkey is being used by Germany as an instrument against Great Britain. He thinks that we should concentrate to obtain equal treatment for British goods on the Sadijeh-Khanikin line, a route already traversed by more than 1,000,000/, worth of British merchandise. Commercially, a railway between Bagdad and the Gulf would, he thinks, be of comparatively little use, and would even prejudice our trade if built with the proceeds of a 4 per cent, increase in the Customs duties. In the discussion that followed, Mr. Lynch’s views as to the unimportance of the Bagdad-Basra branch were called in question by Lord Ronaldshay, Mr. Lloyd, M.P., and others, but his views as to the Sadijeh-Khanikin branch received support! Mr. Lloyd advocated a line from Kut, below Bagdad, to the Persian frontier. Colonel A. C. Yate adhered to his opinion that the Trans-Persian Railway was very likely to be built, and he thought it would be strategically safe. Captain Macaulay spoke in favour of Indian isolation.72 \ (VII.)

The author gives a useful historical account, with dates, of relations between Great Britain and Persia, and then goes on to a discussion ol railways. Russian Lines.—Re thinks that for many reasons a line from Julfa through Tabriz and Kasvin to the capital will he the first line to be constructed m Persia under Russian auspices. It would connect with the mercantile capital o± 1 eisia (Tabriz), open up Ajarbaizan, strengthen Russia s grasp on the northern pi evinces, and he the first step towards the connection of the Irans-Uaucasian and Iia . A corollary to this line would he one from Baku to Tehran via Lenkoran, Astara, and Resht, with a junction at Kazvin, to be continued to Meshed via BandcT-i- ,ez, Astarahad, the Gurgan Valley. Bujnurd, and Kuchan, with a branch from Kuciian to Askhabad on the Central Asian Railway. Other lines that have been proposed are : — (i.) Dushak, on Central Asian Railway via Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun to Meshed, with branches to Kushk Post and to Kariz via Zulfikai. Tehran to Meshed via Shahrud. 3-dad to Tehran via Kermanshah and Hamadan. Tehran to Yezd via Kum, Kashan, and Ispahan, or Rum, Gulpaigan, and Ui. (iiij (iv. Ispahan. (v.)

The line Julfa-Tahriz-Tehran-Ispahan-Yezd might become “ the nucleus of the “ Trans-Persian line which has been the dream of more than one railway concession “ hunter.” British Lines.—Captain Lakin enumerates, in order of importance— (i.) Mohammerah-Shushtar, with a possible extension through Dizful to Khoremaha( 1. (ii.) Nushki-Seistan. (iii.) Chahbar-Kerman via Regan and Bam. In the event of the Trans-Persian line being seriously considered, we should obtain control over the Yezd-Kerman section in the neutral zone. On the ground of physical difficulties he dismisses the idea of direct connection between the Bagdad Railway and the Indian system. There is much in favour of the connection of Bushire with Shiraz and Kerman, hut the work would he very difficult. . . .

Memorandum by Mr. Coohe respecting the Julfa—Tabreez Railway Project. THE official “Commercial Gazette” of St. Petersburgh of the 7th (20th) December states that the Tiflis Bourse Committee, with a view to facilitating more successful competition with the English and Germans in their gradual conquest of the Persian market, has submitted a report to the Council of Representatives of liade and Agriculture on the necessity in the first place of building a railway line from Julia to Tabreez. The Bourse Committee points out that the construction of this line is called for by the last Russo-German agreement, by which Russia undertook to improve the route to Kazvin-Hamadan-Bagdad, while, too, the existing Kazvin-Hamadan chaussee road has already succeeded in attracting to the north of Persia English textile goods competing with Russian. With the carrying out of the agreement by the continuation of the road to Bagdad, Russian goods will be altogether supplanted by German. Only the construction of a rail line from Julfa to Tabreez can avert this This line, 425 versts (84 miles) in length, would be a natural continuation of the Russian railway system, and its construction would present no difficulties, while the cost would not be very big. The Bourse Committee adds that traversing a thickly-peopled and rich llnpv wrmld he of enormous importance to Russo-Persian trade. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1.

As regards article 4 in the draft contract providing for the free grant of land by the Persian Government for the purposes of the railway, Captain Haworth suggests that it might be possible to make a private arrangement with the sheikh allotting him a certain number of shares in the company. This suggestion would appear to be impracticable from the nature of the undertaking. I he sheikh, however, as well as other powerful landowners, will doubtless require compensation for the land used, and I am inclined to think that when the negotiations are resumed with the Persian Government, it would be better to modify article 4 in a sense less likely to provoke the hostility of those whose lands would have to be expropriated.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegrams Nos. 964 and 965 of the 2nd October, I informed the Sheikh of Mohammerah that a company of high standing had approached the Persian Government with the offer of a loan for the construction of a railway from Mohammerah or Khor-Musa to Khoremabad, that the company was an entirely British one, and proposed to construct and work the line, and that the treasurer-general had placed the proposals before the cabinet with a view to their being submitted to the Medjliss. The sheikh left himself entirely in our hands, and said he trusted that we would see that his rights were maintained; as in my former conversation with him on the subject he referred to the fact that a railway would render him far more accessible to the Persian Government, and said that he relied on us to support him against encroachments. [2286 s —11 &gt;t mmdr 2 I would suggest that while pursuing the terms of article 4, that all land would be given by the Persian Government free, it might be possible to make a private arrange ment with the sheikh allotting him a certain number of shares m the company; it has to be remembered that though the Persian Government is or may be content to give the land free, they do so for a definite consideration; the sheikh, who does not participate in that consideration, can hardly be expected to follow their example. i In so far as the railway line passes through the sheikh s territories he will be expected to give protection and safety to its employes; the suzerain Power then receives the benefits of the concession in the sheikh’s lands, but it will be the latter, in reality, who will be called upon to supply all that the company requires—a fact which, I trust, will not be lost sight of in the carrying on of the negotiations.
