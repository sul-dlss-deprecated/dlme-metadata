As this sum is only Rs. 62/- less than the amount due in accor dance with the Indian Pension Rules, I do not con sider that the Government sh.op.ld have to pay the total of Rs 1882/11/- in addition as this would mean her receiving a double amount. paid The idea was that the amount already/was a form of compensation as there was no pension scheme in the Bahrain Levy Corps. I consider that as the Government has already paid ffc 1000/- and given considerable assistance in connection v/ith their expenses only a sum of Rs. 782/11/- is due to her.Code / Tologran Fron Political, Baliroin.
