About 3 years ago,your petitioner came to Bombay at a time when there was considerable excitement and discontent among the people of Bahrain in consequence of certain high handed acts of the Britsih Consul.The complaints of the leading and respectable inhabitants were disregarded and the Consul 4 Consul General forced 3haik ^asa to abdicate and installed his eldest son on the Uadi against the remonstrances of the Kulor and to thn great dis satisfaction of his people who resented this interference of the British Officials in the internal administration of a free and independent otate in the Persian Gulf. 4. On your petitioners return to Bahrain about the month of juno 1923,the people appealed to him for the help and advice and they were so incensed that they seriously contemplated migrating from Bahrain in a body if their Just grievances were not redressed, xour petitioner advised them to submit to the consul-General a respectful petition detfiling their grievances and praying for redress.ii petition to which your petitioner was a signatory,was accordingly presented but which evoked no response though it was signed by leading and ZK3|atnx±k±K: prominent people with large stake in the welfare and orderly rule of Bahrain. 5, another petition.

Your Excellency, 1. 1 am the Ruling Chief of Bahrein in the Persian Gulf and its dependencies having been installed on the throne, in the Hijri Year 1286. by the will and with the approbation of the Chiefs of all the tribes, constituting the people of Bahrein. 2. From the earliest times, ever since the conquest of Bahrein by the Arabs from the Persian Government in the Hijri year 1197 when the first Shaikh Ahmed bin Mahomed was installed, the Rulers of Bahrein, have enjoyed and exercised full independent powers and have had absolute and complete authority and control over the internal affairs of the State without any right of interference therein by the British Government, as provided in the Treaty engagements entered into between the Shaiks of Bahrein and the British Government. 3. The matters covered by the treaties relate principally to Slave trade and trafic in arms: the maritime interests of the British Government; relations or negotiations with, and cession of territory to a foreign power; and the treatment of British subjects. It is only in the event of a breach or non-observance by the Rulers of Bahrein of their obligations in relation to these matters that any interference of the British Government in the internal affairs of the State could be called for or justified. 4. My administration of my State during its whole course of 56 years has been peaceful and popular, and in consonance with the genuine wishes, and sentiments of my subjects as their emphatic verdict has testified; and there have been no complaint of any mal-administration or misrule by any respectable citzen or responsible section of the populace or any breach of treaty engageme nts with the British Government.M dv I sf: 1 li ' i r r hi ■ 5. I have been a loyal and staunch friend of the British Government, and my relations with the British Consuls were marked by feelings of mutual friendliness and good will until about two years ago when under the regime of Major Daly matters assumed an unpleasant complexion. 6. For some reason or other Major Daly conceived a serious dislike for the Arab people and entertained feelings of personal ill-will and hostility to-wards me, and under the name of introducing 'reforms' alleged to be required and ordered by the British Government, he inaugurated a regime of lawlessness and violence. The 'reforms' which my subjects did not want or demand and which indeed they condemned took the form of forcing on me inadmissible demands for concessions to foreign syndicates the discussions regarding which culminating in my sudden and summary deposition against the will of my people and without any cause but one, the extraordinary plea of old age and consequent incapacity to manage the affairs of the State; It is with regret I have to say that major Daly caused wholesale fining, imprisonments and deportations of my innocent subjects without any charge, inquiry, or trial; abolition of all law Courts except one; making the Consul the sole centre of all legislative, Judicial, and executive authority; the replacement of the Manama Police by armed foreigners; the wholesale oustincr of the indigenous Municipal personnel and its replacement by foreigners; the forcible seizure of the State Customs and the transfer of its revenues to an English Bank regardless of the rights and feelings of the people; the installation against the will of the Chieis of the Xaefas ot my son Hamad, a youth without anv business or administrative capacity or experience who has been lent himself to the influence of the Consul and is coerced by him which fact he admitted before the peoples delegdtes, he is made to put his signature to orders forced upon him by the Consulate, 'which aie calculated to imperil my most valued pearl trade. No wonder that such a regime exasperated the people and drove them almost to desperation; the country is seething with discontent and irritation, and the people are seriously contemplating the extreme step of whole-sale emigration as the only escape from reign of tyrany, dishonour and indignity to which they have been systematically subjected for some time past. 7. Though their complaints and grievances had till then remained unheeded and unredressed by the British Authorities and their confidence in British Justice and fairplay had been rudely shaken, my subjects, before resorting to any extreme measure convened a congress of the aristocracy and intelligentia of the land and which was attended by the Cheifs of the tribes, Nobles, ulemas and Merchants etc. and at such meeting passed the following resolutions: —J- * 1. Continuance of our own chosen Ruler Shaikh Isa in the administration of internal affairs of the Government as heretofore without the interfererance of the British Consul who should abide by the friendly relations which are binding to us as well as to Great Britain. Should Shaikh Essa desire to appoint his son Shaikh Hamad ( for instance ) the Ruler, we should expect from him what we expect from his father. 2. That the whole administration shall be conducted*in accordance with the Mahomsdan Law and the Equity pertaining to Pearl diving problem which is also a part of the Mahomedan Law. 3. To form a parliament out of the general public which will attend to the interest of the Country and to matters that may arise like the formation of sub-Councils in the whole country. 4. To form a Committee of 4 elected persons well-versed in the Science of Pearl diving whose duty will be to consider and settle cases pertaining to pearl diving. 5. That the British Consul should abide by the contents of the treaty contracted between the Government of Bahrein and that of Great Britain and should not meddle with internal affairs. 6* We have selected from among ourselves 12 persons to do all they can to maintain and make good our demands by all lawful means. They are-Shaikh Abdul Wahab ibin Haji Azziyani, Shaikh Abdul Latif • • bin Mahomedj Sayad Abdulla bin Ibrahim, Hussein bin Ali A1 Mannai, Shahimbin Sakkar A1 Jalahama iMahomed bin Rashid bin Hindi, Ahmed Bin Kasam A1 Johdar. Isa bin Ahmed Addoshari Ahmed bin Lahej. Jabr bin Mahomed A1 Muslim, Mohnna bin Fazal Annaimee, Mahomed bin Sabah A1 Ibne Ali, Thus they are our representatives and every one of us has taken a vow not to speak at all in the above matter without taking their advice and every one of us declares solemnly that we will remain united in every matter, 8. The I2 Delegates appointed by the aforesaid Peoples Congress which was held on 15th Rabi-ul-aval 1342 A. H., with full powers included the Chiefs of the Taifas of Baharein. They submitted to the Consul-general at the Peisian Gulf, Mr. A. B. Trevor, a memorial, on behalf of the people of Baharein recounting their complaints and grievances against the Consul and his -high-handed actions. The Consul general sent an insuliting and minatoryI ■ ■ ■Jf telegraphic message in reply to this Memorial and on the same being notified to the people by Major Daly, the whole tribe of Ad-Davasir promptly emigrated to the neighbouring Dominions of the Sultan of Mejd an eloquent index to the intensity and depth of the peoples excitement resentment and desperation. 9. Three days later, the Consul General arrived at Baharein and the peoples chosen delegates addressed another Memorial to him detailing the peo ples grievances, criticising the so called ' reforms ' of Major Daly and express ing their determination to emigrate in a body from Baharein if Justice was re fused and redress continued to be denied to them. 10. Soon after, the Delegates were invited to the Consulate by the Consul-General who addressed them in curt and threatening terms, refusing to vouchsafe any answer to their Memorials or any redress of their grievances and threatening drastic pains and penalties including confiscation of property and ruination of valuable pearl-fishery trade, if the emigration resolve was put into execution, and intimating that the neighbouring Arab Chiefs had been instructed to turn the emigrants back and refuse them shelter. 11. On the conclusion of this intimidating address, two of the delegates present viz; Shaikh Abdul Wahab Azzayani and Ahmed bin Lahej who had taken a prominent part in representing the people were at once taken into a room of the Consulate, and without any notice, explanation or inquiry were taken into custody in the name of the British Government, and promptly con veyed to a British Man-of-War which was kept in readiness for the purpose in charge of three Military-men and ultimately deported to Bombay in such custody and on their arrival in Bombay detained in a private Hotel under the surveillance of the Police, All the offers of Arab friends of theirs who had come to Know of their arrival to put them up at their residences and to provide substantial security for their behaviour were peremptorily refused. It was only after Shaikh Abcul Wahab Aizayani moved the High Court of Justice at Bombay for an Order under^Section 49] of the Criminal Procedure Code and the writ of Habeas corpus was issued by the High Court that he was set at liberty. 12. Affairs at Baharein are going from bad to worse and the repressive and reactionary policy of the British representatives is calculated to inflame not oniy the populace of Baharein but the whole of the Arab Nation, and lead to disastrous disluibar.ces ar.d corrmoticn not easy to be quelled.^ ' . ij. It is against these acts of violence lawlessness and gross outrages against mv peoples feeling, and sentiment, and liberties no less than against the intolerable persecution to which I myself have been subjected to in breach of Treaty obligations in the matter of my prerogatives as an independent Ruler of Baharein that 1 seek protection and redress at your Excellency's hands, and I do so in the hope and confidence that adequate protection and redress will be vouchsafed to a true and tried friend of the British Government after such full and independent inquiry into the whole situation as the nature and circumstances of the case may require and as Your Excellency may think proper and necessary. 14. I am well aware that interested agitation by some members of the Shia minority of my subjects has been engineered by or with the connivance of my enemies resulting in false and malicious complaints being forwarded against me and my adminstration, to the Consul General with a view to create prejudice and ill-will against me in the eyes of the British Governmet. I am not ignorant of the fact that covetous eyes have been cast on my world famed and cherished Pearl fishery. I know that the valuable resources of my state have excited the cupidity of foreign exploiters and concession-hunters under the auspicies of the Consulate, and I am painfully conscious of a powerful body of imperialists looking askance at the independence of Baharein and desiring to see that it was brought under their influences and other sinister motives working against me. But I am unwilling to believe that any such influences could have found or would find favour and support with Your Excellency, I feel it difficult to persuade myself that my deposition would have been ordered or sanctioned by Your Excellency and I am anxious to believe that I shall not be judged or condemned on interested and exparte re ports of the local authorities. Upto the present moment not the slightest inti mation has been given to me of any adverse reports or any matters alleged or charged against me or any explanation required or called forth from me. I he most serious and unprecedented act of my deposition by a British Consul against the emphatic wishes and in the face of the indignant protests of my people as represented by their delegates and in contravention of my treaty rights constitutes a grievous wrong to me and my people which is sought to be justified on the extraordinary plea already mentioned hereinbefore of my old age and in capacity to manage the affairs of my State which I emphatically deny as it is absolutely without foundation.■ * 15. The Consular authorities have not only pursued a terrorist policy towards me and my people, but they have gone to the length of stifling and punishing expressions of the peoples complaints and grievances. Their proceedings ill accord with British traditions and are contrary to all cannons of justice and fairplay. While the meanest criminal is not judged or punished without being accorded a full judicial trial, the independent Ivuler of an important Arab principality enjoying the confidence and afiection of his brother chiefs and subjects, a loyal friend of the British Government, scru- pouslv observing his treatv obligations and entitled to demand the fuliilment by Government of the independence guaranteed to him by solemn engagements is condemned and punished with un-heard of severity and indignity without a trial or inquiry of any sort and indeed even without any notice of any charge against him being given to him. 16. I desire to emphasize the undoubted fact that the internal affairs of a State are the concern of the people themselves, that the interference of the Consul was uncalled for and unjustified, that the independence of the Ruler of Baharein having been guaranteed by the British Government provided he fiul- filled his treaty obligation as I claim to have done, my summary deposition brought about as it has been, is a breach of treaty obligations and in contraven tion of immemorial rights, usages and precedents and further it is opposed to the religious and political sentiment of the people and is at variance with recognised and accepted rules and principles of justice, and I trust that such action will not be countenanced or approved of by Govemment. ly. I therefore pi ay that Your Excellency will be pleased to institute a thorough and independent inquiry into my case and the proceedings of the Consular authorities concerned hithereto taken allowing me full opportunity and facilities for my defence, placing me in possession of all reports and all other communications and allegations which may have been submitted to Government behind my back to prejudice me, and all matters which may have been alleged against me, and orders which may have been passed by the Govern ment on the materials placed before them exparte, so as to enable me to meet them and I pray that such course may result in obtaining the necessary redress and I may be restored to my former position and prerogatives of an independent ruler in accordance with the treaty obligations hitherto entereJ&amp; into and followed and which will satisfy the sentiments of the Arab people and conserve the peace and contentment of Bahrein. 18.

Shaik Isa Bin Ali Al Khalifa by his constituted attorney Abdul Wahab Zayanni. ^ •A (Collectively). To, His Excellency Colonlel TSEVORE, The Diplomatic Agent, &amp; The Consul General for the Persian Gulf at Busbire for the British Government. From SHAIK ISA BIN ALI, the Chief of Bahrein and his Nobles, Scholars and the Chiefs of the (Tribes). Your Excellency, In your absence have occurred great incidents and important matters which disturbed our thoughts and ruffled our senses. Our treaty with the British Government was for justice equity respect for the Arab tribes and assistance. But with much regret we have to state that we have experienced from the present Diplomatic Agent ( Major Daly ) treatment interference and his tendency towards disturbances and encroachments which have collided with the British Policy and have transgressed it precedents towards the Arab people This made us invite your attention hoping your Excellency would right the wrong after inquiring into what has taken place at Bahrein of disturbances and mischief though during a century that passed before this occurrence no mis chief was heard of and no blood was shed at Bahrein. This will help you to understand as to who has been the cause for all this. And we are sure of your gentlemanliness and straightforwardness, Your Excellency :— Since the accession of shaikh Isa to the throne of his country he has abided by the friendly relations between him and the British Government and the many years that have passed would prove that he has preferred to be friendly with Britain to any other feeling and hilly confident that on her part she too would answer by tightening the ties of sincerity and confidence tending to mutual good and with an intention of assisting theArab tribes in their pro gress. We felt grateful to her for her abiding by the understanding wade be- tween us both. But since Major Daly is appointed for us the activity hasf.L X.,' I I it. 1 I proved to be entirely retrograding and his actions show that he is altogether ignorant of the British Policy towards the Arabs. We bore patiently his going astray beyond the lawful barriers and preferred not tronblig you with the matter and hoped that he himself would see his way to what is right. But it was in vain for he continued persistently his policy injurious and caluminous for Britain, and lastly five months ago he and Col. Knox who harbours old malice towards Bahrein and its Government in a spirit far from veracity and uproots the pillars of our confidence and that of the people in His Majesty s government if we did not know that she won't allow them both to continue this interference. Thus we could no longer connive at things and pacify the spirit of the tribes and promised them that we would inform you the details of what has passed which we state as follows :— The actions perpetrated by Major Daly are ;—Formation of Police of strangers and handing over of the offices of the Municipality to an alien in an Arabian country. We rose and protested and sent petitions after petitions toSaikh Isa which petitions (Major Daly) he presented to him and we received no reply to our protest. In the month of Ramzan there occurred a small quarrel between an alien and an Najdi. The Police Officer and the Municipal Officer were influ enced with their communal prejudice and ordered the aliens to fire. The duty of police is to set apart the quarrelling parties and to set up an inquiry. But the communal prejudice prevailed and the police instead of doing their duty undetook transforming a small quarrel into a bloody revolt and this proved what we had expected and had told Shaikh Isa too. Three days after this Col. Knox arrived in the British Man-of-war and we expected good from him and reversion from the injurious diplomacy. But he simply amazed us by his demanding from Saikh abdication of his throne. That was a strange matter. Is this the result of the friendliness of Britain ? So we did not agree as well as our Shaikh Isa won't. Then we assembled and resolved but the Colonel and the Major ignored our existence altogether and began to threaten us with punishment and the man-of-war started throwing on our country search light at night warning us of danger should we not agree to this disgrace of ours, and within two days got over Shaikh Hamad by frightening and threatening him that he should administer the Government instead of his father and wrote to Shaikh Isa his deposition. Then the Major went to the Customs House, took possession of its revenue and deposited them in an alien Bank and then he encroached upon the Native Courts of law, did away with them and started only one Court where should be submitted all complaints and petitions irrespective of their being long causes or criminal or summary suits and put himself with Shaikh Hamad in this Court thereby did away with the Native Government. He did all this without even taking us into consideration as if we were not from this.w country. Will Great Britain approve of her agent treading upon the honour of peaceful tribes which never stood but by the side of the Great Britain in a friendly temper of mind particularly at a time when she is trying to begin assisting Arab tribes ;— Your Excellency :— One of the happenings that agitated and hurt the feelings and which took place at Bahrein is the seizure of our compatriot Ahmed bin Abdulla Aldosari in an annoying manner by sending the man-of-war to capture him at the Diving place. When he came to know of the ship's advent he presented himself when at once he was imprisoned without any trial and was fined Rs. 15,000 (Rupees fifteen thousand) and was ordered to write admitting his crime which he declined to do and remained in the gaol a long time under threats to himself and to his tribe if he won't pay up the fine and admit in writing his crime, the man-of-war would bombard and destroy their villages. Ihen he petitioned soliciting to know his crime or to be tried by a legal tribunal allowed to every accused. He was given no reply. After they made out his determination not to admit his crime they exacted the fine Rs. 15,000 and set him at liberty. No doubt this is a sort of interference the like of which wont be found in the modern history and never has been heard a thing like that in our relations with the British Government nor in the relations of any other people than ourselves with other Diplomatic Agents. Your Excellency :— We have stated all this feeling fully^ We have full confidence in you that the right will be given to the rightful and that our confidence in the justice and equity oi Great Britain will be renewed. Should we and our Shaikh Isa be disappointed and what the ante British say of the above mentioned happenings having taken place by the order of the Imperial Government and under her knowledge then we intimate that we wont be able to suppress the feelings of the tribes some of which have determined to emigrate and agitation is already apparent in some of them. We sue for justice and equity or mercy. Have mercy on us in our own country and leave for us our honour in our own hearth and home. 16th Rabiul Aval 1342 A, H.

(An English translation of the Memorial presented to the Consul General of the Persian Gulf, dated 22 Rabiul Aval 1342 A. H.) Your Excellency, Major Daly has notified to the people of Bahrein the following declaration in reply to the petitions. Declaration From Consul A. B, Trevor, C.S.L, SJ.E. Consul General for the Persian Gulf. To The General public in Bahrein, As I have come to know from the petitions I received and from other sources that the people have some doubts as to the continuance of the current policy and the reforms introduced in Bahrein I colonel A,B, Trevor C.S.L, C.LE, clearely inform and assure the public in Bahrein that his Majesty's Gov ernment after thorough Official enquiries ascertained in the month of 'ShavvaP' last that the state of affairs in Bahrein was much in need of reforms, conse quently His Majesty s Government issued orders to begin the necessary reforms. I declare to the people that the orders of His Majesty's Government will be executed in all circumstances and the programme of reforms which we have already begun will continue steadily without the least hindrance/' Your Excellency, This declaration indicates that you seem to have understood from the petitions that the people of Bahrein despise reforms and prefer barbarism and chaos. No, Your Excellency, we are civilized people and not barbarians and have been striving for reforms. We belong to a nation that was civilised in pre-historic times. But we do not admit a thing to be called by a name other than its own. Can anybody call what has happened and is in force at Bahaein Reforms ? Is it a reform to depose the ruler of a country against hisJ- will and the will of his people without just cause ? Is it a reform to deport, imprison and fine people by thousands and tens of thousands without trial ? Is it a reform to replace the Manama Police by armed foreigners who have proved to be the principal mischief mongers ? Is it a reform to make Major Daly the centre of the legislative the judiciary and the executive powers ; for he is a legislator, a judge and an executor. Is it a reform to abuse respectable persons on trial in commercial suits ? Is it a reform to do away with all the courts and keep only one in a country like Bahrein to which tribunal should be submitted all complaints and petitions irrespective of their being summary or long cnnses and irrespective of their being criminal or otherwise ? And which will hold session only once or twice a week ? Is it a reform to transfer the revenue of the country to an English bank without the consent of the people (though it is their money paid out of their pockets) ? To conclude let us grant that all these are the reforms which the civilization of the 20th century has determined and that Mr. Daly came to bring the glad news of them. But is it lawful for a man to seize the house of another on the ground that it is in great need of reforms ? In fact for real reforms the people have endeavoured and have been striving, but Major Daly blocked the way and came between their efforts for the country's good to such an extent that he transferred the municipality which is the outcome of the work and efforts of the people, to aliens who are hated by the people. As to the so called reforms being executed in all circumstances, to that we do not and will never agree and we do not think your Excellency would have forced it on us if your Excellency had been acquainted with the facts. We will try our best to preserve our self-respect religion and country by all lawful means. Should force interpose between us and the preservation of our religion and national honour, we will emigrate out of the country. Yes we will leave the country with tears in our eyes and sighs heaving from our boosoms I And thousands have already emigrated 2 days ago to a place where they won't meet a despot like Mr. Daly. Yes, it is a matter of regret and the tribes of the Arab nation have certainly censured us for so doing but there is no help. The treaty is being trodden upon ; law is being neglected; Government has been done away with; libertv is being infringed; honour is bei::g scorned at, contempt is being poured down, complaints go unheard. These are the reforms, they say, which are very badly wanted in Bahrein. Yes there were faults in the Government, but the people were striving after reforms and the then Government agreed to carry out their wishes. The proof of that may be found in the petitions sent to Shaikh Isa one after another, liut the Consul always came between Shaikh Isa and the reforms to be -'ntroduced and every body knows th?it 2 years ago the peopleI I I united and required a Parliment to which Shaikh Isa agreed. Then who but the Consul thwarted the proposal ? Did any person other than the Consul, who bates Arabs from the bottom of his heart, come in the way then ? Your Exellency, Bahrein has a minority of the Shia Community. 1 he clerk of the Consulate started dictating to them statements expressing gratitude and support Mr. Daly and they wrote them against their will and under pressure and some of them wrote them for self interest. Are the&gt;e the reforms, justice and organisation. Orders are signed in the name of Shaikh Hamad whereas he himself declared before the delegates of the people the day before yesterday that he was compelled by Major Dally to put his signatures to them. So we seize this opportninty to submit to your Excellency a copy of the resolutions of the Congress of Bahrein enclosed herein which was held on the 15th Rabiul-avval 1342 A. H. We have the honour to be Your Excellency's most obedient servants. (Sd.) Abdulvahhab bin Haji Zayyant, v ' Abdullatif bin Mahmood. Abdulla bin Ebrahim Satad. Husein bin ali Almannaee.

We complain to you against the unjust intenference of the British Con sul at Bahrein and his enchroachments on our rights and his meddlesomeness :n our internal affairs and the affairs of our subjects and his purposing our dis honour and the disgrace of our people and we solicit in the name cf the wel- known justice cf Great Britain to fix a limit to his numerous trespasses and to set up a thorough inquest into what has been passing at Bahrein in order to keep up the friendly re!ations-and in view of the fear of serious troubles breaking up and silence on these injurious trespasses in the wholesale agitation of the Arab nation and wounding their hearts and a considerable harm to the policy fol lowed by the Government towards the Arab tribes.^ ^ B.

Your letter is received and what you have mentioned therein is understood I do not remember it appearing from the papers that are with the British Government to have consulted the people when the British Govern ment made you King of Bahrein. Besides times and affairs change on all circumstances. So I do not see the least necessity for consulting people as long as the British Government, in view of the public good, considers that owing to your old age you are incapable and unfit for the administration of Government matters. So in accordance with the directions of the British Government received by me, I inform you that now and henceforth you have no right to meddle with the affairs of the Bahrein Government which is trans ferred to your son Shaikh Hamad as your regent. 1 also require you to do the needful so that the order of the British Government may take effect with res pect to the above. 24th May 1923 (8th Shaval 1341.

To Shaikh Isa Bin Ali A'lkhalifa, K. C. I. E. C. S. I., I inform you that I am in receipt of your application signed by you and some Arabs of ' Sunni' creed. Your Highness is in doubt as to the reforms in force at Bahrein, These reforms were not introduced by Major Daly at his will and whim or even colonel Knox Nay, the British Government com-r ■3 r: » i m ■ c ■ : II r M 1 pelled tiiem to introduce them. Because after thorough inquiries and long patience they (the Government) found that the state of things at Bahrein en- tirely wanted reform,, Your Highness will remember that the Government re peatedly called upon you to adjust the state of your Government. One of thes3 demands was made in March i922 A. IX I in pursuance of tho directions of the Government called at your island and called upon you to begin, and secondly in the month of April when your lt Shia' subject could no longer put up with the oppression exercised on them and were agitated, and sent me and to the Government complaints in writing. You personally promissed to make some improvements to pacify them But, my friend, you never made any improvement at all nor did you reply to the final demand of the Government about '^our fulfilling yonr promises; and as oppression and tyranny in your i&gt;land 'iecame a general shame the Government was obliged to introduce reform? and therefore ordered the reforms to be introduced through Major Dally and Colonel Knox whom practically you do mention. I am sure your Highness knows that well but since you ignored it and did not mention in your application I am compelled to make you know of it anew, and then I inform yon that my duty is what was of Colonel Knox and will act upon the oroers of the Government and will hasten the reforms the object of which is to introduce good treatment, equality and unbiassed justice to all. Consequently I am resolved to hasten to introduce the reforms. We draw your attention as well as of the other signatories to the application to the above. It is regretable that you did not heed our advice and that of the Consul and that yourself did^ not introduce the necessary reforms. This is w T hat I had to inform you. Dated 27th October 1923.

The telegram 1163 referred to simply gave resume of Foreign and Political Department telegram No. 1688-S., dated 8th December 1923 and called for the Budget (which was known to be in preparation) and other particulars required by the Government of India. Memorandum No. 207-C.—9-2, dated the 17th December 1923, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, Bushire, No . 207-0.—9-20, dated Bahrein, the 17 th December 1923 ( Confiuential). Your telegram No. 1163 has just been received by me and by coinci dence I have just completed a Budget, which I had intended to send with my replies to the various points raised in your demi-official letters from Muscat and elsewhere. It is apparent I think from the Government of India wire referred to in your 1163 that they are concerned lest we should be suggesting reforms which the exchequer cannot bear. I do not think that the Government of India have yet had sufficient information on the finances .to realise ho.v very much more prosperous Bahrein is than other Gulf Arab States. Perhaps I myself contributed somewhat to the belief that Bahrein was an impecunious state, when I wrote a somewhat pessimistic report (in the light of after events) at the time when Colonel Knox suggested the appointment of a Judicial Adviser to Bahrein to be paid for out of the Revenues. At that time I had had not sufficient opportunity to gauge the assets of the state. Finances were in the utmost confusion and the customs had not been put in order and I could get no information out of the Hindu Director which I could be certain was reliable. For that reason I was most anxious to incur no expenditure before the Customs was in order and I had the benefit of expert advice. We are now, however, in a position to accurately gauge both receipts and expenditure and I think that the attached Budget (I have omitted the details on which the various items are based but they have been worked out minutely and in consultation with Mr. Bower as regards receipts and expenditure is now all fixed and regularised) shows a very satis factory state of affairs and that there need not be any anxiety on the score of finance as regards the cost of reforms proposed the estimates for which are included in the Budget with an ample margin in every case, as will be seen from the remarks against each item. The position is that the state has at the moment over three lakhs rupees in hand. Of this it is proposed to earmark one lakh for improvements to bring the customs up to date, by building sheds to protect merchandise on the wharf, complete the customs jetty, lay a narrow gauge track for moving merchandise, and to build a small bouse on a site already available for the Customs Director. r Xhe actual cost of all these is estimated by Mr. Bower and myself to be about Rs. 80,000 but the Sheikh agrees that we should allow 1 lakh to be on the safe side. We then have two lakhs in hand to meet any initial expenditure for levies, such as provision of huts, etc., and initial equipment and possibly for the provision or part provision of a water supply, which would be an immense boon to the people of Manameh. In addition some of the reforms proposed will not be carried out and become a cost to the state for some months meanwhile the Reserve will be still further mounting up. xi-708 (8).111111 .-si-l i U .i. s4: Apart from this the Budget shows that when and if all the proposed reforms are in full swing we can count on a monthly excess of receipts over expenditure of at least Rs. 20,000 per mensem. I say ' at least' because receipts have been purposely estimated most conservative basis, while expendi ture has been given a considerable margin under each head. The Budget has been prepared for one month instead of one year, which it is hoped will be equally useful, but receipts are the average monthly receipts based on careful study of the figures of the past three years. The somewhat astonishing improve ment is of course due to an immense amount of sheer waste, largely within the customs itself, which it has been possible to curtail. No allowance has been made for the increase of receipts which would result if the increase of customs prices be sanctioned, but this increase would amount (estimated by Mr. Bower) to about Rs 16,500 a month. The estimate ot Rs. 4,000 under miscellaneous headings, on the receipts side, is a very conservative one. Court fees alone, in the Bahrein Court, have recently been amounting to about Rs. 1,000 a month. Letter from the Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.T., C.T.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 56-S., dated Bushire, the 17th (received 30th) January 1924. Sunni and Shiah troubles in Bahrein. In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 90, dated 15th January 1924, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following report regarding the outrage committed against the village of Wadiyan in Sitrah on the night of the 7th-8th January. 2. It appears that during the night of the 7th-8th January a number of armed men, some of whom have been recognised as coming from Rifa, sur rounded the village of Wadiyan in Sitrah and opened fire on it. As a result (as already reported in my telegram No. 51, dated 10th January) one man and one woman were killed and five persons, including one woman, wounded. Rifa is a large village about 15 miles inland from Manameh on the main island which has for years been the residence of Sheikh KhaUd, the brother of Sheikh Isa, and his sons, and is completely dominated by him. I have not yet got the evidence, such as it is, about the actual perpetrators of the crime, but one can start off by assuming without hesitation that no inhabitants of Rifa would dare to do such a thing without the knowledge and consent of Sheikh Khalid and Sheikh Ibrahim, his son ; in fact there is a strong presumption that the outrage was committed by the orders of one or other or perhaps both. 3. The outrage was arranged to take place after Sheikh ITamad had gone on a shooting expedition to the Persian Coast near Lingah, and was probably committed with a view to getting him into difficulties and possibly trouble with Government, as well as with the object of taking revenge on those inhabi tants of Sitrah, or on the people there generally, who dared to complain and give evidence about the previous outrage —complaints which resulted in the banishment of Sheikh Ali bin Khalid to India and of one of his brothers to the mainland. 4. Sheikh Hamad had only left Bahrein on the evening of the 5th and had just arrived at Lingah when the news of the outrage reached Mohammed, who was acting for him, and the Political Agent. The former immediately wired to Sheikh Hamad asking him to come back, and the Political Agent telegraphed to me reporting the affair and asking me to telegraph to Sheikh Hamad and request him to return. This I did and he promptly did return by the first subsidiary steamer calling at Lingah, arriving at Bahrein on the 14th instant. On arrival Sheikh Hamad appears to have called on the Political Agent, and as soon as he entered the Agency the house was apparently surrounded by hundreds of Baharnah wanting to complain to him. The petitioners appeared to have become somewhat clamorous and something of a demonstration apparently occurred, as a result of which Sheikh Hamad produced a letter, which ——presumably had been prepared beforehand, and having read it out to the crowd, handed it to Major Daly. The gist of this letter (as reported in my telegram No. 88, dated 15th January) is that Sheikh Hamad is prepared to take whatever action he is directed to do by Government but is unable to do anything without such orders. In this connection I forward herewith a copy of a telegram from the Bahreini community dated 15th instant reporting this incident and imploring the assistance of Government. 5. Previous to the arrival of Sheikh Hamad certain members of the Baharnah community had presented a petition to Major Daly on the 13th instant asking him to forward to me a copy of a monster petition signed and sealed by hundreds of Bahrein Shiahs. These were duly forwarded to me and a copy of each of them is annexed, for the information of Government. 6. Prior to the receipt of these petitions two Bahrein Shiah subjects came over to Bushire by the mail steamer which brought Sheikh Hamad from Lingah, bringing a petition to me (copy annexed) Th ^y asked for an interview and a reply which they C'Mild take back to the Bahrein Shiah community. I interviewed them on Saturday the 12th instant, and yesterday gave them a reply to their petition, a copy of which is annexed for inform ation, and I told the petitioners very much what I have said in my written reply, viz., that Rome was not built in a day, in other words. But time is going on now and six months have elapsed since we started to introduce the reforms, and it is certain that if the Khalifah family can organize such out rages more or less with impunity, the reforms will be a farce. 7. I enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of Major Daly's letter, No. 13-C., dated 15th January, reporting the incident. It will be seen from this and from the petition of the Bahrein Shiah com munity that the punishment meted out for the last Sitrah outrage was not sufficient. The banishment of Sheikh Selman bin Khalid to Katar is a farce, while Sheikh Ali who was sent to Bombay at the expense of the Bahrein Government is really now more comfortable than he has been in his life. It seems necessary therefore if it is found that Sheikh Khalid or his son Ibrahim instigated or abetted this crime to punish them more severely,: banish ment or deportation on more stringent terms seems called for, perhaps banish ment with a term of imprisonment to start with. 8. As I have already suggested in my telegram, No. '51, dated 10th January, 1 think the institution of the Levy Corps at Bahrein should be expediied. and that if ttie Muscat Government agrees, as many men as can be spared should be lent to the Bahrein Government pending the raising of, the men for the Bahrein Corps by the Comm'andant of the Muscat Levy Corps. 9. I consider that if men are available and are sent to Bahrein, as soon as they have settled down a detachment should be sent to Sitrah to protect the place, and its cost recovered from the emoluments and revenue of Sheikh Khalid and Sheikh Ibrahim. Other detachments could later be placed at suitable places to protect Shiahs from these outrages, and if a detachment has to be placed at any place as the result of an outrage the cost of such a detachment should be met (at least as far as possible) from the revenues of the members of the Khalifah family or Headman of the tribe, shown to have instigated the outrage, or if it was committed by a Sunni village, from that village. 10. It will be seen from the correspondence, as already reported in my telegram. No. 90, dated loth January, that Sheikh Hamad is quite incapable of taking action in the face of the opposition of the w hole Khalifah family. He may feel rather stronger when the Levies are in beinrf, but I doubt if he will really be ever strong enough to do much; besides at heart he feels with all the Khalifah family that the Baharnah are there to be outraged and fleeced and oppressed, and is really not in sympathy with any ideas of improving their position. ,11. I have, unless my memory plays me false, stated on several occasions that the principal difficulty in introducing reforms in Bahrein is the impossibi lity of finding anyone among the ruling family or upper class capable of4 i carrying them out, or even desirous of introducing them. The most practical way of doing so would be to take over the Government ourselves for a time, nominatinsr one of Sheikh Hamad's youngsters as Sheikh to succeed to lull powers alter his education had been undertaken in India or elsewhere. I presume, however, that it is politically undesirable to do anything of the sort or even to introduce too many British officials into the administration , so J presume the only thing to do is to continue to try and make bricks without straw. , ^ , . c,. , 12. In conclusion, I may observe again that the Bahrein Shiah commu nity after years of oppression are absolutely incapable ol doing ain thing for themselves and can only petition us ai d whine. It they had banded together and resisted the oppression of the Khalifah iamily I think they could have done a great deal long ago. Even when they made a lew demonstiations a couple of years ago Sheikh Isa became quite alarmed and was quite prepared to make some concessions. This being the case, our task in Bahrein of bolstering up a ruling family, which cannot rule justly or efficiently, and of helping at the same time a community which cannot help themselves is an extremely thankless one. Telegram from ihe Bahreini Communitt, Bahrein, to the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, Btjshire, dated the 15th January 1924 Sheikh Hamad read to us a letter written to Political Agent that he can do nothing.

Jfter compliments, etc. —It is not hidden from Your Excellency that for years the Arabs ^Sunnis) have committed crimes against the Baharneh, such as murder, looting, etc., and many times we have come to you supplicating and begging for justice between them and the oppressed, but we see no attentkm from you in the matter and for this reason the crimes of the evil doers have increased, and this is not in conformity with your justice. N ever theless we are not hopeless of obtaining your mercy and the mercy of the High Government. Though the Buharneh of these Islands number not less than one hundred and sixty thousand persons, yet shou'd only ten of these remain we will not cease to claim our rights against those who have murdered our compatriots without their having committed any offence. The eyes of the community are set upon the High Govemmeit, waiting for her compassion. In order to complete our supplication we send herewith a petition explain ing the outrages which have occurred and the dreadful crimes of the past and present. In conclusion, we beg Your Excellency to send it to the Hon'ble Colonel Trevor at Bushire, ijuiekly, that he may send it to the Government of His Majesty the King and send us a definite answer and issue the necessary orders to ensure our protection and to remove oppression and obtain for us redress from the oppressors, as we have stated in our petitions. If, God forbid 1 Your Excellency should fail in this, or not strive in th« matter, w e must be compelled to take more definite steps such as the despatch of our leaders to the throne of His JVlajesty the King.

To His Excellency, etc., the Most Just, etc., Colonel A. P. Trevor, the Exalted Constjl-Gineral of the Persian Gulf. After Greetings suitable to your high Estate, we beg to inform Your Excellency, 'with regard to our petition presented by our representatives, Haji Mehdi bin Saif ard Mullah Hassan ibn Shaik, dated 1st Jamad al Thani 1342, concerning the outrage which has occurred in Sitrah and the murders of people there, both men and women. It is not concealed from Your Excellency, the previous outrage at 'Ali and the deaths which resulted. Shortly after a further outrage occurred at Sitrah which was committed by the sons of Khalid bin Ali 'Al Khalifeh. We informed you of that and Your Excellency did not fail and came to Bahrein and gave us assurances of peace and safety. The Court caused those concerned to be brought before it, and after trial, their guilt was proved. We were awaiting the sentence of the Court upon the guilty, when two persons were deported to India and two to Qatar. Your Excellency doubtless knows that there is a distance of only a few hours between Bahrein and Qatar. Those who were sent to Bombay live in luxury and with financial aid from the Bahrein Government, which they enjoy and they are 'well housed. If this is to be the punishment of murderers, all the criminals will continue their -crimes and be happy and obliged with such treatment. We informed Your Excellency before that we were prepared to send re presentatives to London to His Majesty the King, Sultan and Emperor of the British Empire, to obtain orders for security in our land. Your Excellency did not fail, and came to us and verbally promised us security. We were grateful to you and gave up the idea of sending our representatives. But alas 1 In spite of Your Excellency's orders and the orders of the High Govern ment, Khalid and his sons have again returned to their evil deeds and have committed these crimes in spite of the Great Government. All the efforts of the High Government have been to protect the Rulers of Bahrein and they have retained their Government, but their subjects have been neglected. If God forbid ! the Great Government is to fail to protect the subjects, let it be known to us so that we may have resort to some other Government, such as that of Persia or its like. If the Great Government intends to protect the people and maintain order in the land we beg firstly, for soldiers and protectors to be brought to all the villages of Bahrein to give security and prevent the oppression of their inhabi tants. And that also is useless, except Kbalid and his sons be deported and punished openly and with severity, so that others like them may take warning. In conclusion, we beg that Your Excellency will forward this, our petition, to His Majesty the King, before the evil-doers commit further crimes in the land. Haste! Haste! and be so good as to reply to us and to issue definite orders, for it is not possible for us to remain in the land in this condition. 6th Jamadi al Thani 1342.

After compliments.— We beg to bring to your notice that we have already represented a petition to Your Honour and repeatedly asked you and the just High Government to be kind enough to establish order in the tow r n and to remove oppressions from our community, the oppressed Baharneh. We informed you several times about the plunder and murder of people which became clearto Your Honour and also the Political Agent, Bahrein. You were kind enough to assure us and all our community of peace ana tranquility and completed your kindness by your coming to Bahrein where we all expressed our thanks to you and rest assured by the actions of the High (iovernment. But it did not last long and on Tuesday night 1st Jamadi II, 1312 (=8-1-1924)), a party of A1 Khalifah attacked the village of Sitrah, killed three men and wounded two who are in danger. We informed the Political Agent and asked for a Doctor to inspect the murdered and wounded men. As the mail steamer was present and we were in hurry to bring this incident to Your Honour's notice we despatched our petition to Your Honour through our representatives. In conclusion, we inform you that we are all in narrow circumstances and in danger and have no shelter except God and the justice of the High Government. We beg you to support us quickly. We hope to present a petition to you in detail by post. MOHSIN BEN ABDOLLAH BEN EAJAB. SAIYED MOHAMAD ALBALADI. ABDOK EASUL BEN RAJAB. ABDOL ALI BEN IIAJAB. ABDUL ALI BEN RAJAB.

C .T .E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to the Baharnah Community, Signatories to the two petitions dated 1st and 5th Jamadi II, through their representatives Haji Mehdi bin Saif and Mulla Hassan bin Sheikh, and any others of the Shiah Community of Bahrein whom it may concern, dated Bushire the 16th January 1924. After compliments.—I have received your short petition, dated 1st Jamadi II and also your long petition, dated 5th idem, with several hundred signatures. I was exceedingly sorry to hear from the Political A^ent on 2nd Jamadi II (9th January) ofthis second outrage at Sitrah and imme diately reported the whole case to the High Government by telegram, and asked the Captain of a man-of-war to proceed to Bahrein, and ^I tried to proceed there myself but was not able to do so as no ship was available at the moment. I am now awaiting the orders of the High Government. 1 agree that the outrage is a very serious one and hope that it may be possible for the Sheikh to apprenend and punish the offenders, and assure you that any assistance I can give to His Excellency towards doing so will be gladly accorded. As I informed your representatives the tyrannies of generations cannot be removed in a few weeks without extraordinary drastic remedies which it is not feasible to apply. It is only step by step that gocd government can be intro duced.Since I came back from leave in October I hare made proposals for a force of levies or Military Police to be established at Bahrein on the same lines as has bpen established at Muscat and I hope something of the sort will be approved. But a force of this sort even if sanctioned cannot be improvised in a day. Therefore I recommend you to possess your souls in patience in the hope that matters will be improved before long, and to refrain from writing petitions in the strain of the last part of your petition of the 5th Jamadi which is calculated to alienate the sympathies of your well wishers and antagonize others. Letter feom Major C. K. Daly, Political Agent, Bahrein, to Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 13-C., dated the 13th January 1924 (Confi dential). Outrage in Sitrah. I have the honour to forward a petition presented to me by representa tives of the Baharneh Community who desired me to forward it to you. During the past nine months five armed attacks by Sunnis on Shiahs have occurred resulting in about twelve deaths and a number of serious injuries. This does not include the deaths during the Manameh riot in May last. You will remember that for the attack on 'Ali the Sheikh inflicted a light monetary fine on the leader of the Dowasir, who was responsible. Shortly after an 'Alim and another person were murdered. Por this crime nobody was apprehended, although it is beyond doubt that the Dowasir were the offenders. As a result of the previous attack on Sitrah, the Sheikh, much against his sympathies, sentenced one son of Sheikh Khalid to deportation for life, and another for deportation for one year to the mainland. It is evident that such light punishment for so serious a crime has encouraged the perpetration of this further outrage. The first deportee is detained in India at the expense of the Bahrein Government, and is probably in greater comfort than previous to the crime. The' other went, with some followers, to a place on the mainland which is within four hours of Bahrein, to which it has been customary to go for hawking expeditions, lie may be said, therefore, to have escaped all punish ment. Prom this place he returned and took part in the recent outrage. Sheikh Khalid and his son Ibrahim have been importuning Sheikh Hamad and myself for some time past, for the return from India of his son, although be knows he was sentenced to deportation for life and has been absent only a few months. Sheikh Hamad is due back from Lingah to-day . I fear that he will not take any action in the present matter which will have the desired effect of putting a stop to these outrages. He is fully aware of the necessity of doing so, but I am convinced he fears for his personal safety, and is afraid that if he sentenced any member of his family to death for murder, he would start a blood feud among Al Khalifah, which is in fact by no means improbable, although I think it highly unlikaly. He is of _ course unpopular with his family, who are constantly set against him by Sheikh Isa and his wife and Sheikh Abdulla. They are also not unnaturally displeased with his efforts to curtail the constant oppression of his subjects. The difficulties of his position are 1 very apparent, still, I think, if he had the courage to assert himself, all such opposition would quickly disappear. On the other hand, the difficulties of Hamad's position does not seem to me to justify our countenancing continued inability to deal justly with his subjects. His difficulties are largely the result of his endeavours to carry out the reforms desired by His Majesty's Government, which he is without doubt endeavouring to do. At the same time, anyI r I !■ scheme of reforms aimed at the improvement of the status of the oppressed Shiahs of Bahrein, is rendered perfectly useless as long as their lives are in constant jeopardy. Of what avail is Hamad's Court, in which for the first time Bahreinis have an opportunity of obtaining redress, if after decisions therein, the witnesses can be murdered with impunity ? Sheikh Muhammad, who has been acting for Hamad in the latter's absence, has been unable to induce any of the accused to surrender themselves, and has no means of enforcing any orders, had he the desire to do so, which is certainly not the case. They have sent him messages to the effect that they are willing to appear before the Sbara' Court, but inasmuch as no member of A1 Khalifah has ever been condemned before that court, although several have nominally been ' tried the reason for this is obvious, although they present the matter in the guise of religious scruple. Yesterday the Chief Qadhi called on me and expressed his abhorrence of the outrage, and said he had no doubt that Sheikh Khalid's sons and their followers were guilty. I endeavoured, therefore, to ascertain how he would be likely to dispose of the case if it went before him. He proceeded to give a number of ingenious reasons why it would probably be impossible for him to give an effective decision. He stated without hesitation that this was a Political crime, the punish ment for which should be dealt out by the Ruler, or failing him, His Majesty's Government. He added ' Great Britain has protected these Islands for 96 years. She placed Sheikh Isa and his descendants in power on condition that they should rule with justice. They have failed to do so and your Gov ernment has neglected the matter. The policy of your Government is beyond my understanding in these matters. She is responsible for the maintenance cf order in Bahrein. Ho they fear Mustafa Kernal Pasha, that they do not force order ? What more obvious reasons can they need than these outrages. Bahrein needs direct rule by a strong Government until a Buler can be taught how to govern. I told all this to Sir Percy Cox many years ago '. How far the Qadhi is sincere in his statements one cannot say, but he is without doubt the most experienced and educated man in Bahrein. Several deputations of Baharneh have called at the Agency. They all state that His Majesty's Government is pledged to remove gross oppression. They quoted replies to questions in the petitions as assurances of adequate protection. They are deriving considerable support from the Persian Shiah community, with whom the Baharneh are much inter-married. The Persians are making political capital out of our alleged connivance at the murders of Shiahs. and there are rumours that alarmist reports have been sent to Teheran to this effect. Doubtless, there will be the usual crop of anti-British articles in the Persian Press. j • I m GCP, Delhi—XI-708 (S)-12-2-21—7./bS 'Oot-e t/tol 'Oc/icccc/ J '/-CCC, KHARICUIkl• February 8th, 1924 ITo • 31 lUSHlll IkSiO^Ct XJ..^ OOWflDtlTii. — Sir, In reply to your despatch Ho. 4-s of January End, 1924, I have pleasure in transmitting herewith two printed copies in English and one copy in Arahic of the Sudan Givil Justice Ordinance 1900.

Memorial dated 13th ebruary 1924 from Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali A1 Khalifa, K.C.S.I., to His Exceliency the Viceroy. In reply to your telegram No. 480-X., dated ISth March 1924 (Serial No. 301 in file No, 480-X.), I have the honour to submit herewith comments on the above memorial. 1 did not send any with the memorial as all the events and matters dealt with 1 herein have been reported to Government at length and in detail as they occurred, by Colonel Knox and m} self. MC221PD'r 2- , 2. Tlie memorial is a farrago of svfpretsio veri and suggestio falsi; Sliailc^- Isa^s incompetency has been notorious for years. If it had been only incompetency^ he could no doubt have been left in peace in his declining years, but when to the incompetency was added a love of oppression and tyranny and extreme rapacity it became imperative to intervene. Having had a rule of fifty-six years during which he never did a single act for the good of the State or people, and never spent a penny in Public Works—the pier and Custom House which he was compelled to build by outside pressure is no exception as the cost of these was met by a loan raised by the merchants which was repaid ' by increased landing and wharfage charges on goods improted by the merchants—in other words the merchants repaid themselves ! Shaikh Isa has had a good run for his money—or probably * for other people s money ' would be more appropriate. 3. It may not be out of place to say a few words about the origin of this memorial. It has been got up in Bombay by Abdul ahab /ayani who is a professional agitator, and who previous to the deposition of Shaikh Isa, had been a thorn in the latter's side for years, with his coixstant agitation for a so-called Parliament. It will be noticed that Abdul Wahab has brought this body into this memorial in the guise of a ' congress.' Abdul Wahab's ' parliament con sisted (in his imagination) of a few men—certainly not more than a dozen all Sunnis, presided over and presumably nominated by himself ! Major Daly (with whom I discussed the petition and my draft reply when visiting Bahrain on 21st March) tells me that Abdul Wahab returned from Bombay (where he had been compelled to reside owing to the unpopularity of his views with the A1 Khalifa family) about the time he himself was appoint 3d Political Agent. At first Major Daly, thinking Abdul Wahab was agitating for representative government, interested himself a good deal in the matter, having long interviews with Abdul Wahab, etc.; but as soon as he found out the true nature of Abdul Wahab's so- called parliament, he saw that it would be useless as even if it materialized and got power it would only transfer the power from the hands of the Shaikh to those- of an oligarchy^ Abdul Wahab's congress is described in paragraph 7 as including the ' Chiefs of the Tribes, Nobles r Ulema and Merchants ' and the 12 4 delegates ' mentioned' in paragraph 8 included the ' Chiefs of the Taifa As a matter of fact there are no real ' tribes ' worthy of the name in Bahrain—the Dowasir were the nearest approach to a real tribe but they have gone. Abdul Wahab alternately describes- himself as the ' Chief ©f a Taifa ' or one of the ' Ulema He is neither (his only claim t© being one of the ' Ulema r consists in the white turban he habitually wears) . being merely one of the members of the Zayani family which consists of a small number of well-to-do pealring nakhudas and traders. When getting up the last agitation (on my return from leave) Abdul Wahab is reported on good authority to have raised 1-|- lakhs in subscriptions, which he seems to have got out of the Country. This report is to some extent confirmed by the heated altercation which book place (and was overheard) between Abdul Wahab . and Abdul Latif when they were being deported in the course of which the latter accused the former of having ' got away with ' all the funds subscribed. Doubt less Abdul Wahab is now enjoying the proceeds in Bombay, though he will no doubt have to pay up a fairly large sum to the lawyers and solicitors he has employed. But one thing, I think, is evident, viz., that as long as Abdul Wahab can get money from Shaikh Isa and others he will continue to earn a comfortable livelihood by agitating on the Shaikh's behalf. On the other hand Shaikh Isa is very old and doddering now and desires nothing * better than to be left in peace and this petition is not diiectly of his making. He desires to pass his declining years in peace and quiet but his wife, the mother of Abdulla, an old tyrant and Shaikh Isa's evil genius—assisted by various intriguers and agitators—will not let him. 4. I am not aware what the procedure is in answering memorials, but if any answer is to be given to this one I presume it will not be sent to the solicitors who drew it up or to Abdul Wahab Zayani ; I trust it will consist of a verbal reply to be delivered to the Shaikh by the Resident, or if a written answer is laid down by the regulations, a brief one to be read over and handed to Shaikh Isa by the Resident orI the Political Agent, tfe would be convenient if the answer could be sent prior to, or about the time of, Colonel Prideaux's arrival, as the Shaikh and mischief-makers at Bahrain are certain to petition and agitate on a change of Resident just as they did when 1 returned from leave, and if an unfavourable reply to the Shaikh's petition were delivered before or at Colonel Prideaux-'s first visit to the Island it would go far to silence the clamour. In any case it would not be advisable unless circum stances urgently demand it—for my successor to visit Bahrain until he can take with him an answer from the Government of India to Shaikh isa s petition,which will 1 trust be to the effect that they have nothing to add to the communications already made to him.

Enclosure of Serial No. (2). — C omment on M emorial from S haikh S ir Isl B in A li A l K halifa, K .CAt., of B ahrain, to H is E xcellency this Viceroy, dated 13tH February 1924. When the memorial was for\varded to Government it was not thought neces sary to make any comment as each and «very matter connected with the mis- government of Shaikh Isa and the reforms which were initiated in June 1923 under the instructions of His Majesty's Government; have been reported to the Government of India. But as comment has now been called for, the following remarks are offered taking the paragraphs of Shaikh Isa's memorial seriatim. 1. After the words ' installed on the throne ' Shaik Isa has omitted to put ' by the British' Government ' and inserted ' by the will and approbation, etc. ' for which, as far as is known, there is no authority. 2. Subject to the proviso that the government of the Shaiks is reasonably good and not such as to bring odium on the Protecting Power. Shaikh Isa has not got to go farther than the removal of his predecessor and his own elevation to the Shaikhdom for precedent for interference by the British Government. It is common report in Bushire that Shaik Isa was installed as Shaikh on condition that he ruled well and with justice. Though I have no official confirmation of this,- it is so commonly believed and stated in Bushire, and such a likely condition fcr Sir Lewis Pelly to have made, that I believe it to be correct. 8. Shaikh has omitted reference to misgovernment which is a recognized teaSon for interference by the Protecting Power. 4. Shaikh describes h s rule as ' peaceful and popular ' ; it has been peaceful from outside aggression thanks to the protection of the British Government, but by no means so internally for the indigenous population who have been ill- treated, looted and murdered by Shaikh isa and with perfect impunity by every member of his own family and all the petty Shaikhs of the Al Khalifa \\lio desired to act in such a way ', and popular with a small section of the Sunni tribal heads and nakhudas because they could do what they liked. It is emphatically unpopu lar with the Shiah majority as countless petitions and reports have shown. 5. No ' consul ' as far as is known has ever reported favourably on Shaikh Isa's Government. 'Toleration' would describe the feelings of most of the ' consuls ' better than ' friendliness and goodwill.' 6. Before coming to Bahrain Major Daly was serving in Mesopotamia for three vears ; there is no evidence h^ k conceived a serious dislike for the Arab people.' ' Forcing on me inadmissible concessions' a parently refers to the proposed oil concession to the D'Arcy Exploration Company. In point of fact all that was done was to endeavour to make the Shaikh adhere to his promise not to grant a concession to a company not approved by the British Government and to give one rather to the D'Arcy Company, whose application had been made two years earlier, rathet than the Eastern Syndicate. Hie Shaikh refeis to ' the extraordinary plea of old age, etc.'—far from extraordinary in view of Irs re cord. ' Wholesale fining, imprisonments, and deportations ' means as regards 1 I? H tthe fust t\\o punishments only the nonnahwork of the district, tlie numbers bein 0 ' by no means excessn e, and us regards the third punisiiment it has been inflicted spar- mgly, only some half dozen or so deportations having been made and each case has been reported to Government and sanction obtained in advance in all cases except one. Xo innocent subjects have been punished nor any persons without ' in quiry or trial. By k ' abolition of all courts except one ' it is presumed the , Shailvh means all courts except the Consular Court; if so he omits to mention that the only courts existing befor the Reforms were the Shara ' Courts, the Majlis el 'Urfi the 8a] if ah Court, the Consular Court and the Joint Court, and these all exist to-day excey t the Salifah Court which is in abeyance from inanition, &amp;s no one desires to go before it as no justice can be obtained—its suspension however dat^d from before the reforms : more a n«- court in the show of Shaikh Hamad's Court has ^ en .r^ u , rated wLlch 18 very wel1 mana g e d and is greatly resorted to by litigants. i ^I'aikhJiiw e\''r hy courts possibly refers to the ' Majlis ' M'hich every Shaikh and bhaikhling had : these were not courts but im,sponsible vehicles of oppression every Shaikh fining, imprisoning and expropriating the rayats (Shiahs only bien evtendu) at his own sweet will. ' Replacement of Manama Police, etc.' means .tin i? stitution of Police in Manama in place of a few inefficient ' naturs ' (night- watchmen)^ It is true that most of the police are Persians and thus foreigners b At this is simply because the local Arabs will not enlist as there is too much work to do In point of fact when the Police force was instituted every m mber of the Majlis was asked to produce some men from tin community he represented. J he 1 ersians and Bahreinis did so, but the Arais could not get any men to enlist! * My son Hamad a youth, etc.' Shaikh Hamad admits to about 45 years and by appearance is at least 50, and has been doing a good part of the administration for two or three years before the reforms. This sentence is typical of the amount of truth in the statement made, and it is hoped that it is unnecessary to comment on all the rhetorical nonsense in this and many ojbher paragraphs. 7. The ' corgress of the aristocracy, etc.' consisted solely of a few Surmi pearling nakhudas and was in point of fact attended l^y very few persons except the signatories to the egregious manifesto which with the convening of the so-called congress was the work of Abdul Wahab Zayani. It is worthy of note that even of the few signatories too told Shaikh Hamad they were compelled to sign one decrepit old gentleman saying that his hand was actually held and made to write the name by force ! A report on all this however was submitted to Gov ernment under cover of Bushire Residency letters Nos. 602-S., and 622-S dated 27th October and 10th November 1923. (Serial Nos. 208 and 225 in Pile iso. 480-X.). 8. As the memorial was submitted to Colonel Trevor immediately on his rf turn from leave obviously in the hope that the policy inaugurated by Colonel j \nox would be reversed, it was necessary to disabuse the signatories at once or such a hope, but the telegram does not appear to be minatory and insultine:' the English version is forwarded herewith. . * The telegram was sent on 26th October and acknowledged by Major Daly on 27th October (c/. enclosure of Serial No. 208 ibid). The Dowasir migrated about loth November though they had been threatening to do so for months past llie actual reason for their departure was because they had been fined Rs 15 000 at the suggestion of Colonel Knox for the brutal murder of a number' of'the fehiah inhabitants of the village of Ali including women and also of two Shiah ijlema m the immediate neighbourhood of their principal village. The money recovered as a fine was paid as compensation to the heirs of the killed • the tribe thus got off without any punishment for the dastardly outrages they had committed. • j &amp; j '■ 9 and 10. Ihe presentation of the petition and the proceedings alluded to have been fully reported in Bushire letter No. 622-S, dated 10th November ] J2,i (Serial No. 225 in Hie No. 480-X.). The two persons were deported at the urgent request of Shaikh Hamad, and they were informed personally hv tbe j ohtical Agent by the direction of the Political Resident of the reason for their deportation. . 11 : A bdul Wahab Zayani *5id Ahmed bin Lahej were removed at the request ot onaikn Hamad and the proceedings were described in Bushire letter No 62 4 2-^ dated 10t]i November 1923 (Pro. No. 225 ibid). ' * *'12. This is a matter of opfnion. * Any intelligent person ^however cannot fail to see a vast improvement. Even Bin Saud (who officiaJly opposes the reforms and supports Shaikh Isa as the protagonist of islam) admitted in private conver sation with a recent visitor to Hassa that the state of the Islands has vastly im proved while the Shaikhs are better off finanacially than they ■ever were before. 13. Comment unnecessary. 14. Agitation by some members of the Shiah minority.' The Shiahs are in a very large majority and there is not one who has not a grievance against Shaikh Isa's maladministration and oppression— vide m&lt;er aZia Bushire Residency letters ]Sos. 495-S., dafced 30th December 1921 and 24-S., dated 6th January 1922 (Serial Nos. 1 and 3 in File No. 82, Nos. 1-32). ' Covetous eyes Pearl Fishery.'* Shaikh Isa omits to thank the British Government for having prevented the owners of the s^Aid covetous eyes from possessing themselves of the fishery ; many attempts to do so having been made in the past and frustrated by the British Government in the interests of the Shaikh. The sentences following are rhetori cal and require no comment. The sentence ' Up to the present moment from me ' is absolutely contrary to fact. Successive Political Agents and Residents have grown weary with repeated (and unavailing) efforts to get Shaikh Isa to set his house in order. The Shaikh emphatically denies his incapacity to manage the affairs of his State : both his sons Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdulla (although hostile to Shaikh Hamad) admit their father's total incapacity: the number of people (except certain members of the A1 Khalifa lamily and others enabled to do as they pleased by reason of it) who endorse Shaikh Isa's opinion must be very small. His incapacity is notorious and has been so for years. 15. In the circumstances a formal trial of the Shaikh would hardly have been possible. The statement in the last sentence is not in accordance with fact. 16. It is hardly necessary to state that the vast majority of the people never had the smallest voice in the internal affairs of Bahrain ; the Dowasir tr be aad a section of the influential Sunni nokhudas ignored the Government and did what they liked while the Shiah population and all the weak were tyrannized over by it. The Shaikh has again ignored the obligation to govern properly. The rest of the paragraph is mainly rhetorical. 17. Comment on this seems hardly necessary. Bushire letter No. 42-S., dated 27th January 1923 (Serial No. 37 in File xNo. 82-X.) set forth the pros and cons of undertaking the reforms at? length and foretold that to introduce them the deposition of Shaikh Isa would be necessary. Government however decided to proceed with the reforms, so that in the circumstances the blame for the Shaikh's deposition (if any) does not lie with the ' consular authorities concerned.' R. I. M.

The letter from the Prioipal of the !i«yo college i 3 not very clear on the subject of fees. If fees are cherged according to the Revenue of the state they would come on the i5oo scale f but if they are charged in accordance with the'privy purse' of their father they would come on the 600 scale,since 3te ik Hamad's allowance is Hs 60000 per annum apart from entertainment allowances which amount to another 60000 Hs. If the former sc^le is correct,I think ha whole expense of their education would be incommensurate with the bentfit they would receive .Being ar^bs t &amp; lit present quite un- educated t it would be a long time before they could derive much benefit froiri instruction in an Indian vernacular .Moreover I am quite sure Jhaik iamad would disapprove of their being under an Indian Tutor-he has a very strong aversion to Indians.He would much prefer the boys to be somewhat anglieised rather than Indianised. \ On the whole I think it would be by far the better plan if we could find a young i'Jnglishman who would be their tutot £ live with them &amp; teach them.Itmight be easy for to arrange for them to have some extra special tuition in special-subjects &amp; religious instruction under a good Mullah. If they could live at the college on the low 3C« C le of fees &amp; only join in certain classes suitable to them &amp; get the remainder of the instruction from their private tutor &amp; perhaps specirl instruction in some specified subjects,for which they would have to pay special fees,they would of course heve the advantage of games with the other boys &amp; t^e general course of their instruc tion would be supervised by the principal. Their tutor would brinf them home for a holiday in the cold weather ( the short holidays ,three times a yaar would not bo suitr.blo for tham to reti^rn to Bfihrain) o j n Ri - waslcg or two nionths cloar in Bahrsin -&lt;% the rest oi the ye' r they could rem In with the tutor in India.During the short vacations 4 hey could possibly do some short tours or continue their studies somewhere in the hills with the tutor. If such an arrangement were feasible expenses wou^d appear to work out roughly as follows- Fees for three boys at 600 T800 Ad^ ^or extwr tuition spticisl subjects say litchan for 9 months (2 months holidays.one inonth travelling to ^ fro) subscriptions ate Travelling to &amp; fro with tutor about 600 1080 900 2000 SJZo clot he s # servants axpanoes &amp; poeket Money would b« found by Shaik Hamad &amp; need not be allowed for under 1 educationl To the above would have to be added the cost of the tutor. I should imagine it would not be difficult to find a young tutor at Ra 500 per mensem with board. This would cost Tutors salary 6000 Tutors Board (kitchen) with boys for 9 months say ^50 (During holidays in cold weather at Bahrain,he would oe boarded &lt;&amp; fed by &gt;hfe.i]£ or would make him a special allowance of say Hs T^O &amp; give accomodation -this expenditure would be borne by 3hai]c personally 3s need not be charged to budget) Grand Total i!s t2820 I consider this expenditure could be easily borne by the state,but if considered too uuch the youngest boy who is still very 8«Rlliai^ht be left out for a few years &amp; Shaik Ham^d vvould arrfngc for hiiii to have a suitable ar^b mullah hore to make a st-rt. If the above arrangements ure not feasible I would suggest that we try to get an English tutor &amp; let hia take them to a suitable healthy place in India for nine months in the year &amp; teach them &amp; train thera.with the aid of outside instruction for ary special subjects.It will be some 'years before they can want my.drancd i na truotion which would call f or V9ry gre8t e3q)eri8nce 4n the p.rt of tho te_uhar.

I should think h« might ■ ocept the terms outlined on a contract say for three years. I months leave on full pay per arnum or two months on half pay i return fare to i^nglana on lat vo once in three years. filing him .it might be possible that Sir Percy Cox ( or the present High Cotamissioner in Iraq, would know of some suitable, well,educated, young mrin,prefe ra bly with some little experience of the ^et.who would take on the Job. . I feal that to send the boys in their present state to join in studies unier Indian instructirs at considerable expense would be m*er a wr.ste of money as they are not in a position to benifit much by it &amp; Shaik Ha.ad would not regard their being Indianised with anj^ favour.He is however very keen on their gaming ;nglish 4 to play games etc. He is in fact.much to my surprise.avincing . great desire k t0 b9 ljowe(3 t0 visit fnglsnd himself. He apparently feels.now that hs is Huler,that ha has missed opportunities &amp; remarks that his younger brother A the other Shaiks in the Sulf h- ve tri veiled where- 8 3 ha h 3 boon kept in the background by h : s father in the past. I believe that after a few ye,'rs with an English tutor, he would be willing, &amp; gl'd ( to 'end the boys for ■ year or two to an nglish Public school to finish up vith. You no doubt know,that he has alvays ( contrary to most of Ai zhalifeh) . n admirer of English methods, B* oertr-inly shows a very laudable desire to do well by his sons.

I regard it as of greatest importance that probationer should be appointed as soon as possible. Daly has not had long leave since 1914 and is over worked; if an officer could be appointed now and learnt work it would enable Daly later on in summer to take recess which he probably will badly need as he is not in good health. Further, presence of Assistant and consequent relief from petty case work ih his own and in Joint C 0urt would erTable Daly to go ahead faster with import, -ant reforms and get them firmly established before he has to go on leave next spring.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that in the course of ray last interview with King Hussain, His Majesoy stated that he had received news to the effect that the dismissal of »Isa Ibn Khalifa from the dignity of Sheikh of Bahrein had caused widespread discontent, and might cause unrest, among the tribes of the -ersian Gulf, and that -he would strongly recommend a re-examination of the case. He advised that the best way of achieving this would be to delegate some (interested person of trust, preferably not an official, from among the Sheikhs of Basra or the neighbourhood, with the task of enquiring into the effect of the dismissal and the desirability of re-instating ^sa Ibn Khalifa. His Majesty pressed not so much the re-instatement as the enquiry. I said uo him that I was not acquainted with the case, and that I would communicate his message to you.

We cannot but suggest to the benign British Government that the investiga tions into the affairs of Bahrain should not terminate in asking report from the antagonists only, when it is evident that they, possessing powers, can with threats and inducements, rally false witnesses who may give evidence innocently with good intentions in their own opinions. For this only reason we entreat the Government to investigate into the case of Bahrain directly and under their immediate supervision,' What a crucification of justice and humanity would it be should the Government,- owing to their other encumbrances, postpone the trial of the case of the helpless, melancholy and persecuted people of Bahrain indefinitely ; Bahrain to-day is rolling in the lowest aWss of misery and disdain, awaiting rescue at the hands of the wisest judge. His Excellency Lord Reading, the Viceroy of India. Will he disappoint them ? Most probably not; but if lie did, which God forbid : and Bahrain became the scene of action of the helpless desperates, then very likely it will be sard that the people of Bahrain were fanatics and intolerant towards the people following, other religions. We do not intend here to repeat our obligations done to Great Britain by our treatment of her in season and out of season for we do not seek for a favour in returny nay we ask for justice and justice only.- We ask her to treat us according to the pledge she herself had drafted and approved of. We are aware that some individuals of the minor ' Shia community at Bahrain have abandoned their self-respect and are seeking after their selfish motives. Hence Major Dell/ (vDaly) can easily make them tools in getting statements written by them as may satisfy his desire.- But will the lovers of justice esteem it chival rous and honourable? to take advantage of such a religious discord ? By God, stoop ing to such ignoble? measures is a stigma on the forehead of humanity and a stain of disgrace on the face of civilization/ Yours, etc., . ' L Enclosure No. 2. —Copy, op a confidential memorandum prom the Political Agent, Bahrain', to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf , No. 110 -C., date]} the 14th MAY 1924. I beg to forward herewith an article which has appeared in the ''Bonibay Chroni cle.' It is without doubt inspired, if not actually written, by the deportee Abdul Wahab Zayani,- who, some months ago contributed a similar letter to tMs paper. The grievances tdiich he now sets forth are interesting. (1) The aerodrome.—Ai the Ruler's (Shaikh Hamad) request the aerodrome was made in place of one which Shaikh Isa had agreed to, and made, some years back. It was made because the Shaikh wanted to use the old aerodrome as a build ing site. At his request I supervised the work in order that it might be carried out in accordance with the advice of an Air Foio£ Officer who selected the site to which Shaikh Hamad agreed. Labour was supplied by the Shaikh's order from various surrounding villages. The villagers were paid and fed at the expense of the Shaikh's Government. They have since several times offered to dO any more work should^ it be required, but no more is necessary! Shaikh Isa was not consulted as all such matters are now dealt with by Shaikh Hamad. (2) Boat Tax.—An initial registration fee of.Rs. o for all boats except small fishing boats, has been .collected by the Shaikh's'Governmerib. R-enewals cost Rs. 2 annually! # Pearling licenses of Rs. 200, Rs. 100 and Rs. 75 according to size of boat have similarly been issued for boats actually engaged in the pearling. This tax amounts lo less than half the tax collected at Kuwait, Qatar or Qatif. It is now collected Ifom all classes whereas, in the past a much heavier tax was collected from Shiah^8 while the Sunni Nakhudas, to which class Abdul Wahab Zayani belongs, escaped all taxation. The tax was introduced by the Shaikh after consultation'with me and the approval of the Hon'ble the Kesident. Boats have been numbered with a distinguishing letter (B) to denote Bahrain and the registered number. This is in accordance with the system existing all over the Gulf. ^o numbers have been 'changed' such boats as were numbered previously bore ordinary numerals, but the majority did not register although registration has theoretically been jn force for some years. (3) No member of the ruling family has been deterred from travelling. A great many of them gravel from time to time. As a matter of form they generally ask Shaikh Hamad's permission before going, (4) Some time ago Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa told Shaikh Hamad that he would like to make it known that he now supported his rule. Shaikh Hamad suggested to him that as he had been instrumental in starting a press campaign against him in the past, he might write a letter to the press stating what his views now are. He iote a short letter to some Arabic papers—I do not know whether it has appeared in the press or not. Doubtless it is to this that the writer refers. Probably the information was supplied to him by Shaikh Abdulla's son, Mahomed, who has always been a supporter of Abdul \\ ahab. Some months back, at the suggestion of the Kesident, this young man was fined by Shaikh Hamad for intriguing. The ' Bombay Chronicle ' apparently readily lends itself to this sort of article. Hie tone oi a letter about education at Aden which appears on the same page is \ ci} similar. 1 am informed that about two years ago some action was taken by the Government of Bombay against the Editor for permitting seditious articles to appear. i anir-u 6-?4—7— cipsHo. iis - of 1924.

W9,soiie time ago, deciderl that as soon as the .uevies come into being ^ are commandeo by a British Officer,the itate should tcke over the Police c form an efficient force which would be undr?r the Commandant levies for training, discipline &amp; administration,with a he^.d of Police responsible for the ^purely police duties.

Got a uiieco commies ion in the t$ar. Was much liked by some of his officers, but was regarded as too much of a babu by others. He speaks and writes English and Persian very well. He did excellently as a commander of a small post on the line of communications and as a Uews Reporter. Also got on well with Persian officials. But after he had left Persia, I found he had been acting as Agent for a scoundrel named Captain Bhandarkar almost (temporary, I.M.S.) who imported xJupxt lakhs' worth of articles - motor cars, watches, haberdashery &amp;c - without paying customs duty, and sold them all over T^ast Persia. Ke was run in eventually and had to pay double duty on a lot of things. Bhandarkar, after he was demobbed, finally swindled a lot of Persians, and he employed Khudadad to dispose of his remnant stock at Jumin, where i3iudadad was commanding. Certain financial agreements were entered into, which were afterwards repudiated; goods given to Persians2 Persians by Khudadad had to be taken back, and the men were never compensated fully by Bhandarkar, who afterwards got Into serious difficulty with people he had cheated in India. He is probably in jail now. 1 can't, say that Khudadad did anything dishonest himself, and he may have been assisting his superior 00 officer simply out of g^dness of heart, not knowing the latter to be a scoundrel who cheated many of the Keshed Consulate clerks out of all their savings (Rs 7,000/- in the case of the sub-assistant-surgeon, and several thousands also from the Head Clerk t) I am inclined to say 'Give the man a trial, and ajiy warn hin severely against taking^part in Trade transactionB ,, .

After the visit I remarked to Shaik Hamad that Shaik E^sa seemed a good deal more pleasant &amp;: contented than has he en the case on ^ther occasions when I have visited him since the introduction of the Reforms, onaik HaLiad replied that he thought Shaik Easa v/ould readily accept the position,were it not for his wife &amp; a few others who encourage him to oelieve that ne may expect ^reat results from his petition to II.E. The Viceroy .Shaik Hamad said that he hoped the reply to his petition would come soon-he was most anxious ,if possible that it should arrive oefore he leaves for Europe, as he feels certain that as soon as Sliaik Easa realises that the position will not be altered cx that there is no hope of his 'being allowed to once more actively conduct affairs,he will settle down quite happily &amp; he (Shaik Hamad) would then be able to induce hin to accept his allowance from the State Revenues,which he would much like to be able to do before he leaves.I think Shaik Hamad has correctly guaged his father^ attitude &amp; that as soon as he learns that Governmnet will not reverse prior decisions,he will soon become reconciled to his lot,He is,i2: fact,much less worried than when he was the active Ru er,&amp; has little personal desire to interfere with affairs,were it not for X the constant agitation of his wife,who has been encour;. by the delay in receipt of a reply to his petition,to imagine that it will achieve the results they wish f.os. ^ ti ^ 1 I'a.J or .

I will bear this in mind and will look into matters carefully when I visit Bahrain • probably next October. Fhaikh Hamad # as you know, paid me a brief visit last month, when he spontaneously spoke of his great trust in and love and admiration tor Daly. I obtained the impress- -ion at our interview that he whole-heartedly approves of the four chief reforms which are under weigh, i.e. in the Customs Administration, the Municipal Sanitation, the Revenue Settle- -ment which will so much ameliorate the lot of the Shia cultivators, and the Pearling which will emancipate so many divers, including a majority of negroes, whose lives at present are harder than those of slaves. I expect that you are receiving instalments of the new edition of the Foreign Office 'Consular Ins truetions^. We recently received Chapter 7711 and in its Annex I notice that Bahrain is now included in class »B.

But anything beyond this, anything in the nature 01 a new departure, involving eoiomitments for the Government of India, is sure to meet with opposition. Shaikh Kamad, I take it, at present holds all the rein^s of Government ir. hie own hand. Is there lll^.ihood of his delegating any powers in the near future to a competent Cabinet of indigenous Ministers, or even to one Vazir.?

It seems that Government of India don't want to hear too much about how civilised the State is getting, and particularly don't want complaints that you are virtuallv ruling the State. So, beyond annually reporting progress, I am inc.Linea to avoid mentioning the Islands much in official letters. I iiOpe uhe -■ earling and Judicial reforms will create no fuss. I sometimes wonder how Kamad will get on when yoj a.e on leave or have lelt. It almost seems to me that he should have an English Vazir, unless there is a capable local man who is not known to me. It's a pity he may not like to have a man like Inarn ul Haq, who , I believe, is honest. Perhaps he would accept him. He is in the F.O. now. Yours sincerely, Sd/- F. B.

Representation on 'behalf of Shaik Sir Isa bin Ali A1 Khalifa, K.C.I .E., C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrein,to His Excellency the Viceroy. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 1T0.36-X- dated the 18th day of June 1924 informing us that the Government of India are unable to modify their former decision regarding our clients summary deposition from the Gadi of Bahrein and that no action could 'be taken on his 'behalf. Our client is deeply grieved and disappointed with the reply of Government couched as it is in perfectly general any terms without any attempt to meet^/of his specific complaints or to refer to any of the grounds of the refusal of Government, to institute an independent inquiry into his case which is one of very peculiar hardship and indignity. Our client feeling aggrieved at the order of Government denying him any redress whatever proposes to submit an appeal to His Lordship the Secretary of State for India-In-Council. He has already incurred considerable costs in and about submitting his memorial to the Government of India and fur ther heavy costs will be incurred in connection with the proposed appeal to the Secretary of State. In view of his deposition and of his being left without any means or resources. resources to meet the costs of his defence, our client requests that Government will 'be pleased to direct payment to him out of the revenues of his State of a sum adequate to provide these costs estimated at present at about Rs.50,000/-. Government are doubtless aware of the existing practice of providing for such costs in a case like the present, and our client, a consistently loyal friend of the British Govern ment, is unwilling to persuade himself, that after having been unjustly deprived of his position and rights, and of all his resources, Government can or will refuse him the means of vindicating and asserting his dignity and his Just rights by all legitimate means open to him. Our client requests that a very early and sympathetic consideration may be accorded to this request to enable him to seek and obtain the relief and Justice unfortunately denied to him by the Government of India.

True Copy Superintendent, Foreirn and Political Departmentl &gt;The Political Agency Baliriin, 31/8/24. fayj y /yj Your D,0, Ho 487-3„ I think the Govermi^t of India have heen inclined to regard as 'KefornG* a good many matters which in no way come under that i .eauing.In ,ne first place the matter which created a storLi was the removal of Shaik iSasa from the active conduct of affairs &amp; the opposition put up by the ITakhuda class who had had everything thei^ c ' r ' 1 v ' '' lw 0 ' reared tuat they would have to come into line unaer the new regime. The decision to remove Shaik Uasa was taken hy Govt.as a necessary paving of the way to the r Reforms T . The regorms contemplated wrpe- (l) The setting up of an elementary tribunal where subjects of Bahrain could get a reasonable measure of justice. (^) Insistance on a reasonably fair deal for divers vis-a-vis Lakhudas-that is to say that the existing system should be fair- ly carried out-no^innovations vrere contemplated. (3) A survey to enable a record of rights in property to be com- is « / 1 piled to put a stop to the wholesale looting of the 'oroperty of J f k-? • v .liich lias gone on in the p^.st &amp; ^o stop the incessant disputes as to boundaries,one of the main causes of bitterness between the Shiahs &amp; the ruling Sunni class. The above were suggested by us as necessities &amp; realily agreed A X- • to by Shaik Hamad &amp; at every stage have^his full support. In addition the Shaik(llamad) himself, asked to be allowed to maintain- (4) The LeviesT to support his prestige &amp; enable him to exert some authority.lt was obvious that without some force he could do nothing to stop disturbances 8c we were always obliged to ask for a ship whenever a f row f occurred.The Levies when trained should obviate the necessity for this. In your letter to Ilr Latimer you mentioned 'Sanitation* .This was not however part of the 'Reforms 1 ,A Ilunicipality was started before the 'Reforms ' were thought of,but as Shaik Easa always thwstted the efforts of the Municipality progress was slow.Since( (po Shaik Hai.iad took charie pro-ress in evary direction of Municipal work has 'been rapid.He is himself President of the committee &amp; the entire management of affairs is vested in the Municipal Majlis.The PoA. ao ^nds mcetinrs ex officio &amp; the members often consult him,'but %•-] ,0:' . iclping hemai -v.eked to do so,he has no ]?art in its management &amp; Sliaik Haniad himself takes no decisions except with the concurrence Ox the majority of tlic members. The improvements effected 'by. one Municipality are nox part of the 'Reforms* introduced by us. To revert to the actual 'reforms' (l) me Bahrain Court has been working .or over a ycac &amp; is most some popular except perhaps with^members of A1 Khalifeh v/ho now have to oe amenable to Law like everybody else ,&amp; a fev/ of the rich men v/ho ,under the old regime, nobody could compalin against no matter what they did. All thaj; remains to be done is to ^et out a simple 'Civil Code ' &amp; much 'Criminal Code' as xk±3: for the guidance of the (^oiirt as for the information of the public.It is not fair on either i that cases should be decided off-hand by the light of nature alone. Shaik Hamad &amp; everybody whom we have consulted, desire a simple set of Rmles,(Sc their introduction will meet with general approval. The idea is to keep everything as simple as posLiele. (2) Diving- The main difficulty has been overcome, inasmuch as ITakhudas have stopped their opposition &amp; now produce their accounts to the Courts when required. The Shaik will shortly is^ue the proclamation f a copy of which wasscnt you with my ITo . There ii, nothing new in # this-it merely lays down the existing custom but insists that the ITakhudas should not swindle.The onlyx innovation is the introduction of th divers' account books.This was proposed by Colonel Trevor &lt;5c agreed to by Governmnnt &amp; the books are printed &amp; ready for issue at the expiry of this seas on. The object is to do away with the custom of allowing accounts to run on for years w ithout the diver knowing how he stands .Everybody knows that the system is about to be intrad- -uced &lt;Sc a^ree/ that it is a good one. The decent ^akhudas welcome it-, as 'orotecting them mucxi as it does the divers .iTakhudas who were r-iven to sharp practice naturally don't like it. (3) The Survey is arranged for-evcrybody knows about it^Shaik Hamad isparticulary keen on it, as it will stop much litigation &amp; remove many ot the causes of trouble between young hot head, of his family &amp; m , subjects. Since he started hi S court he has £ on e on the principle that ten years occupation constitutes a right to property,but that 1: ' eV * nt 0 ' • es8 than ten y* ar « ,Provided if it be proved that the property was wrongly come by,the dispute is adjusted in court. A considerable number of such cases have been disposed of in the last year .. loss itly a few more will come to light when the Word' takes place but not many are anticipated.Nobody is now afraid to claim his rights &amp; those who had claims have not been slow to avail themselves of the Courts (4) The Levies are in bein^;, I knov; 01 no other f reforms» that are contemplated. Ordinary improve- cnts such as the water scheme,improvement of roads,buildinr a eea- front.etc etc are the normal developeisnts of the tftate.They are naturally givtn prominence because under Shaik Easa's rule nothing was done ao all,'but they are not tK eforms f initiated by us, they are improvement« effected by Homad on which he is very keen,Surely it is not our policy to stop him improving his state if he wishes to? He is particularly anxious to make a ^how* to prove to the public that his conduct of affairs is to their benefit. So x-cr xrom the Government of India being further 'committed'' everything tends to lessen their commitments. Presumably they do not ic 0 «uic. uiic ohaiks request for assistance in finding a sublAsst, Surgeoirv as a commitment? If so,it was only necessary to decline^ he would have made his own arrangements,but we thought a trained man selected by the Hediacl authorities for the post would be more useful. The other possible t comitments T are the O.G.Levies &amp; the Levtj equipment^ &amp; the A.P.A. The first two are'e.ntirely paid for by the Bahrain State.All that GovernmBnt has done was to find the office* / such assistance has already been afforded Muscat &amp; is ,1 believe, generally afforded by Governnm^t to States under her protedtion or in treaty relation with her. The appointment of an A.P.A.is to some slight extent a , commitment f but an unavmadable one. Even before the reforms, case wori had increased so much that GovernmiEnt had recognised the necessity for an Indian Assistant.The post remained vacant durir. the three- 1 10 ^ ,;l -I ysaro I liave been iiere on the score of economy,tut if I may venture to say so, it is solely due to tlie rsict that I happen to know araMc &amp; V'tn. ian c: can consequently dispose of case v/ork fairly quickly &amp; dispense with an Interpreter,which siade it possible for ne to carry on without an Assistant, Statistics shew that case wor^: is steadily in- creasin^ # x-erhaps this is unf ortunate &lt; but it at least shews that the court is fulfilling a w^nt,&amp; in Court fees alone the expense of an Assistant is easily covered .As you know,Indians are not at all pop- -ul.-r iiere ■ there were many reasons why it was considered desirable uhat the assistant should be aK British Of i i c er . jbcTxigy yarw-^y^ar-fc^^^ -y. That Bahrain is gradually becoming more civilised may or may not , suit us, but I fail to see ho?/ we can stop it .Every year more people 11 or?! iierc 10 uo -uurope in the pearl trade &amp; come back somewhat enli^iit sned,&amp; a number ol educated people now come here frequently oijft -i. ia.- - ic not postibie therefore, that ideas should remain fix ed, It was precisely because Shaik Easa refused to move alittle with the times,while his subjects were advancing, that ■v.wKuri gave rise to necessity for a more enlightened Ruler. I think the Government of India may-rest assured that no body waMts to intrfiduce any more T reforms * or to commit them in any way further.Improvements in the Administration will howevrr gradually take place unless v/e take it upon ourselves to forbid Hamad to carrv out his Ideas.It seems to me that once the 'Record of rights* is Erragp -g are compittdd &amp; the diving books /brought into^use 8c the simple rules are got out for the Court the t Rfforms T may be allowed to die a natural death 8c that we should not drag in every small improvement in the * administratiin .of the state &amp; label it as a ^eform 1 . 04.1 C- Z ' / ^,/63 CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, i- / I have the honour to refer to your letter Ho. 36-7, dated the 23rd Au£UBt 1924, in ithich you call for my views on a letter from Shaikh lea's rolicitore, with special reference to the suggestion that the Bahrain State should provide the costs of the Shaikh's memorial to the Oovermaent of India end of a further appeal which he pro- -pose# to address to the Secretary of State for India. 2. he Ciovernasnt of India will remember that in 1869 the father of Shaikh Isa bin All was killed by a cousin who usurped the Chief ship of Bahrain. The British Govern* -ment intervened, the enemies of the deceased Shaikh All bin Khalifa were imprisoned and Shaikh Isa was installed as Chief on the nomination of the heads of the Arab tribes of Bahrain. Shaikh Isa has always entertained an exaggerated idea of the benefits conferred on him on thtsoccasion by the tribes, who in consequence have been accustomed to assert a their internal autonoiqy and to deny the Chief's right to pass i H! orders upon them. This has been the chief cause of the Shaikh's unsatisfactory rule. ihe mass of the people of Bahrain, who are Arabic speaking Shiaha, were the sufferers and their condition resembled that of helots, who could call no lands nor the produce of any lands their own.9. 3. The climate came lac t ye^ir, Uiough the Shaikh h a d been.remonstrated with repeatedly throughout hie ion; reign, aa the history of the State in 'Aitchlson^ Treaties• Vol, ull # para. 149, and later records show only too clearly* 4. In i^y opinion the Gov irnnsnt of India were entirely within their right in withdrawing ruling powers from this Shaikh las^t year and transferring them to his eldest son, whom Shaikh Isa, his relatives and the tribal Shaikhs had asked the Government of India to formally recognise ao heir to the throne in 1897. 5. In the circumstances it seems to be a waste of time and money for Hhaikh Isa to submit further appeals anywhere. here cannot be anything new in them, and my predecessor has shown that the memorial addressed to Ills Excellency the Viceroy was full of inaccuracies and false- -hoods. 6. If the Government of India have already sen* a copy of the memorial of February 1924 to the Secretary of State for India and if that officer has concurred in thetr decisional would suggest that the Solicitors be so informed. 7.

Froin the date of ;Lis abdicatioit onaik Isa has resolutely refused to oaj.vd txxS allowance mao,e him ii-i spite of the repeated requests of Shaiks Hamad &amp; Abdulla. He is led to adopt this attitude by hi£ wife who is under the imptession that by refusing iia any \ ay to agree to the aew regime he wixl eventually be reinstated. Shaik Isa refused to have an account at the Eastern Bank or to take any allowance.He was asked if he would prefer to draw it in cash direct or to have it paid to his nominees bit declined to takt it at all. For several months the money was paid into a - special fund ( not a personal account because he refused to open one or to operate on one) in the Eastern ]3 ~.nk in the name of Shaifc Isa. When a sum of about Rs 32,000 had accumulated &amp; Shaik AbdulUk reported that as loag as he lived Shaik Isa v/ould be unlikely to accept any allowance',&amp; that the means he had were really sufficient for his needs,the sum was reabsorbed into the Consolidated Fund of the state 8c utilised for state expenditure. The fact that Shaik Isa has not actually received his allowance is therefore entirely due to his own attitude. As regards the statement that he h ,s no st^te lands,please see my ITO.I07/G referred to above, in which I estimated the Revenue from his properties at not less than Rs 2000 per mensem , Shaik Hamad has now supplied me with the following information regarding x^roperties possessed by Shaik Isa, the rents of which he enjoys.Probably Shaik Isa prefers to call these properties privately owned by him.They were of course,as was the case with nearly fvt— ifl all the property ol a 1 Kha^ifeh acquired by purchase ***.[ theBeve.ue of the State i.e. the Customs receipts, &amp; as such .re State property which,i„ the ordinary course of eve.ts would t. in herited by Shaik Wd. Shaik H^ad is apprehensive lest Shailc I S a cut of spite to him should gift or otherwise dispose of these properties.Ha would probably give them to his wif. The properties mentioned below are i* aduitiou to large estates which Shaik Isa has , llowed his wife to manage &amp; which were similarly ac^irefi, state Revenues &amp; which that lady still possesses.

The rents of the properties owned by his wife(apart from • certain properties she owned i„ her own rights) probably amoui.ts to as much again .

Political Agent reports that for eight months a sum of Rs. 4000 monthly was paid into Eastern Bank, Bahrain, to a special fund in the name of Shaikh Isa. Shaikh Abdullah reported that this procedure was useless, as Isa would never touch the money. The sum was then re-absorb- -ed into the Consolidated Fund of the State and utilized for State expenditure. Shaikh Hamad will be only too pleased if his father changes his mind. The income from date gardens which the old Shaikh collected last summer was Es. 40,000. These gardens were bought by him out of Customs Receipts and will be resumed as State property after his death. He also owns many small gardens not specified in the above account. His wife owns estates which probably produce as much income again.

He, however, returned to Karachi on the 15th January having obtained a visa on his passport from the British Vice Consul at Bushire. 2. It was owing to the report forwarded with your endorsement under reference that Ahmed Rifaat was refused permission to land in India in December last, and as it is obviously very undesirable in such cases to exacerbate feeling by refusal and then a month later to have entry forced upon the authorities, I am to request that the Government of India may be informed of the circumstances in which the visa was granted.

J As regards our client's application to be put in funds for expenses con- nected \uth his appeal, we may remind you that the grounds on which the application was originally sought to be resisted ^ was that he had been drawing Rs. 4,000 per month from the Bahrain State. Our client posi tively denied this statement and a8S erted that he had not drawn any allowance It now transpires Ihat the statement was wholly unrounded and our client s denial thereof was fully warranted. The ground for resisting our client's application is now changed, and it is stated that for eight months, a^sum of Rs 4,(i00 per month w^as paid to the credit of our client with the Eastern Bank, Bahrein, and that the procedure was discontinued as he ret used to accept the allowance and the money standing to his credit was absorbed into the State consolidated funds. .It is not necessary for the present purpose to inquire how moneys once placed to the credit of our client could have been withdrawn and re-absorbed into some other fund without his autho rity and knowledge. It is only necessary to state that this change of ground does not, any more than the original statement, negative our client s application. So far as our client's constituted Attorney knows our client had no notice or intimation of any kind whatsoever of the credit having been opened for him with the Bank named , ,r at any time during the eight months. Moreover, w hat our client wants is, not any maintenance allowance but funds for a necessary and legitimate purpose. He much regrets the suggestion in your letter that he should place himself in direct correspondence with his son on the subject of an allowance ^ w^ch looks very much like adding insult to injury. He has not asked for a maintenance allowance, and it is unthinkable that he, the Ruler of his State, unjustly deprived of his status and his privileges should go to his son a suppliant tor an allowance. He must decline to approach his son. His deposition, was the act of the representative of the British Government, and his application tor pecuniary help to obtain justice, is rightly made to Government, and we are instructed to press this aspect of the case. The statement that our client in last summer collected a sum of Rs. 40,000 from certain State gardens which were allowed to remain as his private property, is, we are instructed, as much of a myth as the state ment that he had been drawing Rs. 4,000 per month as would be ascertame on proper inquiries. .. £ * a We are instructed now to request that our client's application ior tunas may now kindly be acceded to at an early date as being just and proper and necessary to enable him to seek the redress hitherto denied to him.Ho. 81-3 of 1925.

Sir, /9V I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your memorandum No of 1^5 with attached correspondance. With regard to para 4 of your letter No 8I-S of 1925,1 beg to report as follows- The inlormation lorwarded to you under my number 245/I/I of 8/12/24 was obtained by me,in the first instance,from Shaik Hamad bin Isa C.S.I. When the latter gave me the infoimation I particularly impressed upon him the, necessity for careful verification and did not immediately accept his estimate# Shaik Eamad therefore sent for a Bahrain! who has most reliable knowledge of all the property possessed by Shaik Isa &amp; other members of the family, &amp; actually performs the duties of agent for Shaik Isa in the collection of the rents of some of his gardens Sc has firsthand knowledge of the others,being either ielated tc f or otherwise closely connected with the actual leaseholders of them. This individual was questioned by Shaik Hamad in my presence, &amp; some trifling discrepancies in the information already furnished by Shaik Hamad were rectified# Some of the gardens I have seen myself, &lt;Sc from my knowledge of the value ofl similar gardens I have no reason to believe that the information given was not throughly reliable. Since the receipt of your letter under reply,I have again consulted the Deputy Ruler,Shaik Hamad bin Isa C.S.I, who assures me that there is no doubt as to the accuracy of theinformation given by the Bahraini (which almost entirely agreed with thit previously given by Shaik Hamad,which he had given both from hie personal knowledge^ after verification from sources other than the Bahraini ( ^yed Shubbar^who was interrogated in my presence. As previously explained,some of the gardens are rented on a cash basis &amp; some for payments in kind-dates,firewood,lucerne etc. and the aggregate values are as already reported. In all probablity Shaik Sir Isa bin Ali has no personal knowledge whatever of the gardens from which he derives an income. It has always been his custom to hand over the management of such aifairs to a head fidawi t ihe person generally now employed by him being one Syed Hashim, Whether Shaik Isa ever gets the full benefit of his income is a matter on which I should not care to speculate. Moreover,in all probability Shaik Isa never actually receives any cash,it being his custom to have all his redeipts paid over to some nominee(for some years it has been Ali bin Abdulla-father of the notorious Jasim A1 Chirawi) on whom he draws as occasion demands. As regards the solicitors remarks on how a sum of money once paid to Shaik Isa f s account could have been withdrawn without his knowledge^ that as far as is known Shaik Isa had no knowledge of any monies having been placed to his account,the facts are as follows- As stated in your telegram No II8I of Nov.isth. the allowance was for many months paid into a 'fund in the name of Shaik Isa* It was not paid into Shaik Isa f s account,because he had no account at th&lt; Bank^and he resolutely declined to sign the necessary document to open an account,and to operate on the funds at his disposal. Thinking that he might be prejudiced aginst taking money from the Bank,both Shaik Hamad &amp; Shaik Abdulla begged him to intimate how, or to whoin he would kike the money paid for his bentfit. He declared that under no circumstances would he accept any money whatseover from the State funds. So far from his having no knowledge of the money being available,many members of his family ,over a period of several months endeavored to overcome his intractibility ^ On one occasion,at the request of Shaik Hamad,I visited Shaik Isa and endeavoured to him of the futility of imagining that refusal to accept money fromxijc the State funds could in any way•»i ^« &lt;jC ** id^Zj /?7 influence the decision / which Governmajat had reludtantly been compelled to tsLke^ith regard to liiis ceasing to take an active part in ruling the Islands. The interview w^s friendly, &amp; I wobt endeavoured to explain to him that there was nothing derogatory in accepting part of the state funds for his personal use / &amp; that it was .the practice in all states,of v/hich Muscat was an example Shaik Isa while listening to my arguments reiterated that he Aid not wish to accept any allowance,whether it 'be paid through the Bank^or by any other method„ It might not be out of place to add that the solicitors inj&amp;axx letter *aixjkXHjaftfis probably based on information supplied to them by Abdul ^ahab Zayani-Shaik Isa's attorney in Bombay,who was res- -ponsible for various petitions^ etc. t which Government ha»t seen during the last two years,and whose lack of veracity is now fairly notorious, I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient Servanl jor.

Memorandum. / / / Reference Residency endorsement No.246-S dated 16th July 1925. I have spoken to Sheikh Hamad on this matter. He 1ms made indirect enquiries, which have failed to elicit definite information as to whether or not Sheikh Isa was actually aware of the purport of the telegram. Short of questioning Sheikh Isa directly on the subject, I doubt if the required informcttion could be obtained, and I venture to deprecate such a course for the following reasons. Firstly, Sneikh Hamad informs me that on his return he was struck by a marked change for the better in his father's attitude towards him. The former was delighted at the safe return of both his sons and really proud to think that they had had the honour to be receiv- -ed by His Majesty the King in London. Sheikh Hamad is loth to dispel the good impression made on his father by the obvious success of his visit to Europe. He is afraid that this might be the result if he were to raise the question of the telegram now. Secondly, Abdul «»ahab Zayani, Sheikh Isa's constituted attorney in Bombay, died there on the 24th June, apparently only six days after the despatch of the telegram, of which he appears to have been the main originator. You will doubtless remember that he was deported from Bahrain in November 1923. &lt;»ith his remov- -al from the scene, it seems quite probable that Sheikh Isa's active opposition.to the present regime will die a natural death.1^1 263, COHFIDraTIAL .
