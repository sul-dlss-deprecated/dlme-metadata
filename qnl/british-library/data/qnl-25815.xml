Squadron, .iesserry A.H. . and Creswell h. .. .1. :.) visited Koweit on April 5th without inforruing hin or the Political Agent beforehand. I feel sure that the failure to warn the Political Resident was an oversight on the part of the people con cerned but I should be glad if M.E. could be asiced to ensure that in future the Political Resident is informed before such reconnaissances are carried out. As we have had a telegram from the Government of India agreeing with the Political Resident^ wishes for prior information I thine we can talee it that this party were working under the orders of the General officer 0Oiamanding-in-Chief, Middle iast, and not unaer the Commander-in—Chief, India. avoid future incidents of this nature could you say a word to Middle j£ast.
