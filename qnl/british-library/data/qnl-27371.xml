R.P.Watts. -Maj or,I. A* Political Agent &amp; IT.B.li’s Consul,MuscatWe have been considering the points raised in your letter P.Z. 7271/37 of 10th November on the subject of the falling off in the numbers of British subjects and British Protected Persons registered at the Consulate at Muscat. 2. On the assumption that the failure to register is due to the burden of the registration fee of 1 rupee we agree that either (a) the standard fee for this service should be reduced or (b) that the standard fee of 1 rupee should be maintained, but that His Majesty’s Consul should be empowered to apply at his discretion a lower fee (which should not however be variable) in cases of poverty. J.P. Gibson, ttsq. REOD. pet. UDEC1937 INDIA yrrjGfi 3 ./3. We understand that the provision in paragraph 10 of Chapter 9 of the General Instructions to Consular Officers regarding the waiving of fees applies only to fees leviable under the Consular Salaries and Fees Act with which that Chapter deals and not to fees levied under extraterritorial jurisdiction by virtue of Foreign Jurisdiction Orders-in-Council. Article 83 (3) of the Order-in-Counci1 is we are told, irrelevant. The article only means that the fact that certain specific duties are imposed on the Political Agent in the Order-in-Council does not mean that he cannot perform other duties of an administrative consular nature. 4. Subject therefore to the views of the India Office and of the Government or India we would propose that action on the lines or (b) of paragraph 2 above be taken, in which case we would draft a formal direction of our Secretary of State under the Muscat Order-in-Council which would be posted in the office of His Majesty’s Consul. We would suggest that the alternative fee be fixed at say 4 annas, with the possibility of a complete waive:-in X extreme cases. 5. In order that the reductions may have the effect of/of making British subjectscome forward more readily to register, it will be necessary to give them adequate publicity, and this might be accompanied by a warning that steps will in future be taken against those who fail to register. 6. It is for consideration whether, while we are about it, identical action should not be taken in regard to the registration of British subjects at Qatar, Bahrain and Koweit. 7. Would you let us have your views in due courseFOREIGN OFFICE, 3.W. 1. 11th November, 1937. (E 3435/31/91) Dear Gibson With reference to India Office letter P.27.3^81/37 of 23rd June on the subject of the registration of British subjects at the Consulate at Muscat, we assume you have not yet had a reply from the authorities in the Gulf. Perhaps you v/ould not mind drawing their attention to the matter once more. Yours sincerely, J. P. Gibson, Esq.D.O. Vo. O lol* /18/66 CX^-s date d the October, j p./. ) 7271 j l 195 7 ! * 1937. Will you please refer to your letter &gt;T o. T 2 3881/37 , dated the 24t1i June, 1937, on the subject of the working of the Muscat Order in Council for 1936? 2. The steady decline in the number of British subjects registering in the Muscat consular area appeared to be attributable to at least three causest (a) that British subjects were not troubling to register, in which case the strict enforcement of the penalties of provision (9) 2 of the Muscat (amendment) Order in Council, 1922, could be considered. (b) that British subjects were leaving Muscat territory. (c) the possible exclusion of G-wadur figures. 3. The Political Agent, on being asked his vie7/s on these points, was of the opinion that the decline was due to the cause at (a), and that the disinclination arose from the unwillingness of the poorer people to pay the fee of Be.l/-. As regards (b), he did not think t^at any considerable number of British subjects had left Muscat territory. As regards (c), he pointed out that difficulty was always experienced in inducing the destitute people of Gwadur to register. 4. The Political Agent has taken M.,T. Clauson Bsouire., The India Office, POMPOM . POl. DCPT. 8 NOV1937 1ND ,- »CE ' steps to bring to the/ *the notice of British subjects that unless they register they 'become liable to a fine of 25/-, and will lose the good offices of the British authorities. This action has had considerable effect, since for the first half of 1937 three hundred and thirteen persons have registered, a figure which compares favourably with 115 for 1936, and 323 for the whole of 1935. 5. The Question, therefore, remains of inducing persons of proved indigence to register. 1 was doubtful if it would be necessary to waive fees in Muscat or Mathra where the people are usually of substantial position, but I thought that perhaps it might be helpful to do so at Gwadur and other places in Muscat territory. The Political Agent was of the same opinion and pointed out that at least one quarter of the inhabitants of Gwadur could be classed as persons of proved indigence, and to this class could be added a considerable number of persons living on the Muscat - Mathra and Batinah coasts. 6. The Muscat (amendment) Order in Council, 1922, does not empower the Political Agent to waive fees, and as it seems to me to be desirable that all British subjects should be registered, whether indigent or not, particularly at Gwadur where a real necessity o^ determining the nations lity of persons involved in disputes often arises, f am of the orinion that, if an amendment were issued to the Order in Council on the lines of Chapter I X pa ragra ph 10^ of the Consular Instructions, • authorising Consuls to waive fees in certain cases, the registration of British subjects in Muscat territory would be maintained at the correct figure, or as near so as possible. 7. Before considering the case further I should be glad to know if you or Brenan have any views on the matter. &amp;&gt;K.o In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - FJins'f j/ A/. and address— / / not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, V* London, S.W. 1. fjfa n - 7 \ $v. 6091 l 1937 I J.O. ?X- Jff/&lt;21.

In 1935 an individual called Abdul Latif a supposed convert to Islam and tfhoae real name is Thiruvangadam son of Krisiinaswamy came to Muscat and soon after his arrival he was employed by Sayyid Hu*ad» the wall of Mat rah. Abdul Latif whose wives were frequently visiting 3ayyid Hamad was well off during the period of his service with Sayyid Hamad whose house was entirely in charge of Abdul Latif*8 wives but as he could not reserve his wives for Sayyid Hamad he avoided his duty as a clerk in consequence of which he was dismissed from service. Abdul Latif is a person who does not believe in any thing but to get as many women as he can in order to make use of them for his personal benefit. Apart from the two / women who are called by him his legal wives he has many other women ready to be produced by him whenever there is any demand for them. He does not hasitate to produce his own wives if they are required. Tnough he drives a car which he owns he does not care for his business ana his chief object is to entrap someone and take him in his car either to his own house and leave him with his wives or to some other house in Mutrah. Abdul Latif attempted several times to come with his wives to my house but I avoided him. It is well known in Muscat and Mutrah that he is solely living on the immoral earnings of his so called wives which is a disgrace to the British Community in Muscat.

There was a slight increase during the year in Civil Litigation in the category of British versus British and • # •and a considerable increase in the categories of British versus Muscatis and Muscatis versus British compared with 1935. In all three categories the great majority of the cases were of a petty nature and were speedily disposed of. Most of the 25 cases which remained pending were instituted during the close of the year when the Political Agent was absent from headquarters on special duty. There was a slight increase during the year in criminal cases in the categories of British versus Muscatis and Muscatis versus British, but none of these were for serious crimes. In these categories four cases remained unsettled, as they were instituted late in the year and could not be dealt with owing to the Political Agent 1 s sickness. Estate, Broceediaga. These proceedings owing to the peculiar conditions prevailing in Muscat axe generally difficult to deal with. Four fresh proceedings were instituted during the year and two pending from 1935 were settled. Insolvency Proceedings . One new proceeding was instituted during the year.

In compliance with the instructions contained in Article 21(3) of the Muscat Order-in- Council, I forward, herewith, for the information of the Governor General in Council, a copy of letter at Karachi No.K./15, dated/^the 8th February 1937, received from the Political Agent, Muscat in connection with the Orders of prohibition passed against two British Indian subjects, Kanraj son of Visanji Halai and Abdul Latif son of Krishnaswamy under Article 21(1) \CQijigpgNm&gt; Copy of a letter No.K/15 of 1937, dated Camp Karachi, the 8th February 1937, from the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul,Muscat (at Karachi), k -JL Subject:- M rohlbitlon of Kanra.i and oi' Abd ul LHtlf I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with your telegram No.74 dated January 22nd 1937 on the above subject. 2. Cn 14th December 1936 I served an Order under Section 21(1) of the Muscat Order in Council on Indian Kanraj son of Wisanjl Halai a British£subject resident at Matrah prohibiting him from being within the limits of this Order for a period of 2 years from the 18th December 1936. The grounds for this action are given in the following paragraph. 3. For some time Past I had received a number of comolaints against this Kanraj in resnect of his mischief making’ activities in ruscat and J'atrah. Accordingly I made enquiries and as a result of information received summoned before me two of the leading merchants of I uscat. These individuals testified on oath that Kanraj through his intrigues was causing enmity between Muscat! and British subjects and generally stirring up trouble. Finally on 20th August the Sultan's Representative on the occasion of an official visit to the Agency made a formal complaint against the individual in question and the trouble and mischief that he was causing in the State and declared that the Muscat Government did not desire that he should remain any longer within their territory. As a consequence of receiv ing the above information I was satisfied that the presence of Kanraj within Muscat State limits was undesirable and that his conduct was dang erous to peace and good order. I therefore served him withwith an Order of Prohibition as stated in paragraph 2 above. 4. A Prohibition Order of 2 years under Section 21(1) of the Muscat# Order in Council was served on Abdul Latif son of Krishnaswamy, a British^subject on January Bth 1937. This man a so called convert to Islam, nosed as a motor driver but his real source of livelihood was acting as a procuratcr and on the immoral earnings of his two wives. His house in Matrah became one of ill fame where disorderly scenes from time to time occurred. This information was obtained from reliable persons on oath and from the evidence before me I was satisfied that Abdul Latif was conducting himself as to be dangerous to peace and good order. I therefore served him, as stated above on January bth, with a Prohibition Order from being within the limits of the Muscat Order in Gouncil for a period of 2 years from that date. 5. It is regretted that in my telegram of 7th January No.5, owing to an oversight the word deported was used instead of the correct word 'prohibited'. 6. The delay in submitting the papers has been due to my ill health.From &lt; Z The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, To The Under Secretary of State for India Political Department, India Office, London Dated Nev Delhi, the 2^-/^ March 1936.

Criminal c&amp;uca uhow a slight increase lof threej over the previous year* but althougn these occupied a considerable amount of the Courts time* the cases were of &amp; nature normally to be expected and no oases remained pending at the close of the year. Estate proceedings find insolvency proceedings presented some difficulty* chiefly owing to the t.ide dispersion of property and parties over both muscat territory and indla* m certain enses which are still pending* considerable was taken progress has been made and full opportunity/of the Court's recess in India to prosecute enquiry into the claims of parties now resident in radio. The working of the regular lanehayat has continued to be satisfactory although from time to time they are inclined to shirk issues and to procrastrusts. The abnormal climatic conditions prevailing during the jura: hot weather ftaa undoubtedly a contributory cause to this defect. The energies of the lolitioal Agent have been largely directed towards persuading parties to compose their quarrels and disputes out of Court. These efforts have met with a grea measure of success* but. none the leas* they have occupied a considerable portion of hla time and patience • 'Solutions' thus arrived at however appear to have excellent results and much of the bitterness accruing from litigation has been happily eliminated.r Minute Paper.

The chaotic conditions prevailing in the local Courts, where Babel reigns and settlements are rarely achieved, have driven many non-British subjects to seek the redress in the Court of the rolitical agent on false pretences* cuch applications have necessarily been refused* Certainly neither justice nor speeay settiiments can be expected at the nanus of the Muscat magistracy. The work of the v*ourt Dragoman in dealing with several chestfuls of ancient Court files that were accidentally brought to light in a dilapidated godown merits considerable praise, entailing as it did hours of extra work wading throug'h unrecorded cases, in some instances fifty years old* These old records have now been successfully dealt with and a fresh system of sauiofacuory filing' is shortly to be instituted. _ « ^ ^ w I have the honour to be, oir, Your most obedient servant. Political Agent &amp; H*B*M*s Cons ul, kuscat* I,^0 V *~ sr /( 1 think we should avoid saying anything in the telegram which assumes that the power of extradition exists at any rate in regard to places in the Persian Gulf* As regards British India, the powers undoubtedly exist under Chapter II of the Indian Extradition Act, the procedure being laid down in section 3 or section 4* The Extradition Act of 1870 oould only affect fugitive criminals of a foreign state who are in or suspected of being in any part of His Majesty^ Dominions or, under section 17, in a 'British Possession' which is defined in Section 26 as any colony, plantation, island territory or settlement within His Majesty’s Dominions* This would therefore seem to exclude the places in the Persian Gulf* A reference to the various orders in Council relating to the Persian Gulf shows that though the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 is made applicable, the Extradition Act 1870 is not. The Indian Extradition Act 1903 is not one of the Indian Acts applied in the Orders in Council. In the Persian Coasts 1907 and Islands Order in Council,/3t!ie Maskat Order in Council and the Bahrein Order in Council 1913 1915/ there is a provision that nothing in the order is to affect the powers of jurisdiction conferred by the (Indian) Foreign jurisdiction and Extradition Act 1879 oti in the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council 1902. That Act of 1879 was repealed by the Indian Extradition Act of 1903, and was therefore not in being when these Orders in Council came into force. As regards the Kuwait Order in Council 1925, the corresponding provision is that nothing in the Order shall affect any power or jurisdiction conferred by the Indian Extradition Act 1903, but in my opinion that is only intended to preserve the rights and powers as regards the surrender of fugitive criminals under the procedure in Chapter III Indian Extradition Act, which corresponds to the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881.2 . Ther© would seem to be no power, so far as I oan see In regard to the plaoes in the Persian Gulf, by which a legal extradition order could be made. I suggest that the Foreign Office might be consulted on the point, and if they agree, the information to that effect might be communicated to tile IT.3.A* Embassy, and the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

Ren^rks. 2. ’Succession Cases' now appear as ’Bstate Proceeuings'* the latter terminology 'being perhaps more appropriate. 3. The chief feature of the v/orking of the Order in 1930 was the institution of regular Punchayats to assist, within the limits allowed 'by the Order, tne Political Agent in tne settling of Civil Cases. Tne composition and duties of these Puncnayats and the advantages gained 'by tnis institution, were fully dealt with in the last Report. It was remarked tnat 'The formation of these Standing Punchayats, simple as it ^uay appear, was something in the nature of an innovation, ana innovations in a conservative place like Muscat are not to 'be lightly undertaken. By the time various details connected with their establishment had been settled, ana tney themselves were fairly under weigh, tne year v-as well advanced. Thus the result of their establishment is not as apparent in the year under review as would otherwise nave teen the case, and the conclusion of 1931 must he awaited before the full results of this experiment can he judged.' 4 # xt is satisfactory to note tnat judgin^ ty results the Punchayats have heen a success. Their working is particularly noticeable in tne improvement in the .^isposai Oi. British! versus Muscati Suits which nave suffered from inordinate delays, deplored hy various Political Agents. Part oi tne Court's increased efficiency shown hy the Luscat State Courts is also due to the reforms lately institutea in tnem, vide para 5 of last year’s Report. The number of British versus4 Muscat! Suits decided in the course of the year under review - 190, constitutes a record, for the last 10 years, as does the smaller number of cases pending at its close - 24. The working of the Punciiayats is also shown in tne number of Liu scat! versus britisn Suits decided which is above tne average of tne last 10 years. 5. Tne number of criminal cases was tne largest for tne last 10 years. The crimes were, however, of a trivial nature, and Muscat continues to be a most lavz-abidin^ town (see _t&gt;ara 12 of last year’s Report). 6 . The attached Summary of Legal Proceedings which has been compiled from previous Reports for tne last 10 years is of interest as givin L a picture of the working oi tne Order over an ext nded period. The figures for Court Pees for last year given as Rs. 4 ,435-14-0 should be Rs.l,700-14-0, as Court Pee Stamps used on Certificate of Identity, and amounting to Rs.2,755, were wrongly included under this heading.

Remarks . 2. It will be noticed that the heading Miscellaneous Civil Proceedings between British subjects has disappeared, such cases be ing 3v—\ a being merged under the general heading of British subjects versus British subjects. These 'Miscellaneous Civil Proceedings were apparently cases put before the Political Agent, and reierred oy him to a Punchayat. If parties like to settle their cases out of Court by private arbitration or other means without involving the aid of the Court, that is their ovm affair. But if the aid of the Court is involved, whether the Political Agent chooses to try these cases entirely himself, or with the aid of a Punchayat (Muscat Order in Council Section 37), it seems only in order tnat such cases should be treated as regular suits. 3. This does not mean that Punchayats have in any way been eliminated. On the contrary their work has been increased and systematized and their status raised. It had been the custom for a new Punchayat to be formed for every case. This led to delay in the disposal of cases. In the latter half of the year, with the approval of the non’ble the Political Resident, a British Standing Punchayat composed of 6 members chosen by the British Indian communities of Muscat, (Hindus, Ithna-asharis(Shias) , Agha Khanis and Sunni Muslims), was instituted by the Political Agent. This Punchayat, of which 4 form a quorum, meets regularly twice a month, in the Agency, and considerable activity in the settlement of Punchayat cases has been effected. Its members in tne first instance are chosen for 6 months, at the end of which period fresh members can be elected. 4. With the approval of the Political Resident and with the collaboration of the Council of Ministers a Mixed Standing Punchayat, meeting twice a month, composed of 6 members - 3 Muscati and 3 British subjects - 5 to form a quorum - was also established to assist the Jahkamah (Muscat State Court) in the disposal of British versus Muscati cases. - The British members were chosen by the Political Agent, their tenure being three months. The Mahkamah had been in the habit of referring certain cases to Punchayats, but by forming a new Punchayat for each case. The *f) /-S L The establishment of a Standing Punchayat meeting at regular intervals has - as in the case of the British Punchayat - led to more expedition in the settlement of cases. To this Punchayat the Political Agent can also refer for an opinion cases of Muscat! versus British subjects. 5. In order to expedite further the settlement of British versus Muscat! cases, in which great delay was being experienced, the Council was asked by the Political Agent, with tne approval of the Political Resident, to appoint an Assistant Judge to help the Minister of Justice, who single-handed had had to deal with all the work of the hlahkamah in addition to many other duties. The Assistant Judge was duly appointed, deals with minor civil cases up to Rs. 50/- as far as British versus Muscat is are concerned, and has been instrumental in helping to reduce the long list of unsettled cases for which British Indian subjects were waiting decision; 6 . It may be as well to explain the fact that the extension and systemati zing of the Punchayat system in no way means that the Political Agent shifts his responsibilities on the shoulders of the Punchayats. In the first place, though under the Muscat Order in Council, section 37, the Political Agent is at liberty in commercial cases (which comprise about nine-tenth of the local litigation), to ask the Punchayat for a deicsion ,in practice all that he asks for is an opinion ,which he can over rule or not as he thinks fit. In the second place, in order to ensure that the Punchayat should know exactly on what points their opinion is required, and that the parties should know on what points they have to produce evidence, the Political Agent first examines the parties to narrow down the exact issues on which they are at variance, and it is these issues which are put to the Punchayat for the parti eVs concerned to argue. Finally the parties are called before the Political Agent to give their a rguinent sr arguments - if any - against the opinion of the Punchayats* and it is not until their arguments are heard that the Political Agent gives his judgment. 7. The formation of these Standing Punchayats, simple as it may appear, was something in the nature of an innovation, and innovations in a conservative place like Muscat are not to be lightly undertaken. 3y the time various details connected with their establishment had been settled, and they themselves were fairly under weigh, the year was well advanced. Thus the result of their establishment is not as apparent in the year under review as would otherwise had oeen the case, and the conclusion of 19 31 must be awaited before the full results of this experiment can be judged. 3. That the Punchayats fill a very useful role cannot be denied. Pirst, and most important, they - under the control of thir Political Agent - help to administer the law for British Indian subjects in a way that is indigenous to the country India, from which these subjects come - the very word Punchayat is of course of Indian origin. As every community is represented no party, in the unfortunate position of receiving an adverse opinion, can say he was not represented on the 1 bench* pronouncing this opinion, and moreover he can always adduce what arguments he likes against this opinion in the final hearing before the Political Agent. The proviso that the members of the Punchayats can be changed at certain intervals is likewise a useful one. As far a s x can be judged indeed the Punchayats are a popular institution. Only one complaint was received, an anonymous petition to the effect that cases were settled too quickly, and thus debtors- against whom decisions were given - were hard put with to keep their heads above water; Complaints that the law moves too quickly are not common, and this petition may be taken as a somewhat naive tribute to the extra activity which the new Punchayat system has introduced into the Muscat Courts. 9.it In point of fact^/is in 'temporin^ the wind to the shorn lamb', and protecting the honest debtor fallen on evil days that the Punchayata do a useful work. Trade conditions are very bad, and much poverty exists. Many merchants, shopkeepers, etc., are forced into the Court through no fault /of their own, and to insist upon full payment of their debts immediately would be to drive the majority into bankruptcy, which would of course bring benefits to no one. The Punchaya ts are, of course, better informed as to the status of local . traders than the Political Agent, and one of the questions frequently put by the latter is in what instalments can the debtor pay off his debt? 10. Another useful function performed by the Punchayats is in the examination of the long, and often complicated, series of accounts - frequently written in Gujarati or Khojki - which litigants produce to prove, or rebut, claims. It would be quits impossible for the Political Agent, who has many other claims upon his attention, to spare the time for elucidating these documents himself without assistance* 11. The Punchayats also act as a board of conciliation, thus carrying out the wise advice given in section 10 of the Muscat Order in Council, A number of cases referred to them by the Political Agent come back with the welcome remark that an amicable settlement has been arranged between the parties. Crim i nal Cases . 12. Of criminal matters happily there is little to say. Though the carrying of rifles is not forbidden, and a dagger is worn as a matter of course by any Muscati subject who can afford to buy one, violent crime is very rare and in this respect Muscat can show an example to many other 'unarmed* towns in other countries. Pone of the criminal cases, either of British versus British, British versus Muscati, or Muscati versus British, were of a serious nature. The severest sentence given was three months imprisonment and Hs. 20Q/~ fine in a case of misappropriation. Gwadur. 13.
