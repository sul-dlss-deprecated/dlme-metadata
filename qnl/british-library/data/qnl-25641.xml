No. 325 in Secret E., May 1920, Nos. 143- on proposed alignment for completion of the Bushire-Shirazf road, which was sub mitted in September 1919 to the Military authorities and of which I have recently been able to make a copy, and to request that, if it is printed, I may he supplied with ten printed copies. 2. It is more than probable that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will in the near future extend their oil exploitation operationspn the direction of Jireh, about 31 miles south-east of Kazerun, and this would at once bring again to the front the question of completing the motor road constructed by the Bushire Force during the 1918-19 operations. If the geological survey round Jireh promises well, the Company would at once take the road in hand and if the experimental boring showed the presence of oil in paying quantities a light railway would, in all probability, follow, as the Company has found that they cannot carry on extensive operations satisfactorily without a railway to handle the heavy machinery and stores which are required. The alignment proposed seems the most suitable and avoids the Kamarij and Tang-i-Turkan passes, following as it does the course of the river from Rudak to Rahdar, where it debouches on to the Kazerun plain and effects a junction with the existing motor road.

From the Reconnaissance Report submitted by Lieutenant Arthur (copy of which was handed over personally to the General Officer Commanding on the 24th instant) it is evident that the nearest and easiest route for road to Shiraz will be from Rudak to Rahdar via west side of Kamaraj Range to Rahdar thence from Rahdar via Shapur Valley, Bal Haiat, Mulla Nairn Pass, to Dasht-i-Arjan. The route of the present mule track and distances are as follows :— Rudak to Kamaraj . • • • • Miles. 5 Kamaraj to Bahdar . • • • • 9 Rahdar to Kazerun „ . • ♦ . a • 11 Kazerun to Pul-i-Agineh . .

Rudak to Rahdar via west side of Kamaraj Range Rahdar via Shapnr Valley, Bal Haiat, Mulla Nairn Pass to Dashfcd- 43 Arj&amp;n. 61 This route from the report is no doubt the best, will give better gradients, be less expensive to construct and a shorter distance. ^ I have divided the tota distance of road up into parts, i.e., levelling, J cutting, heavy cutting and or purposes of estimating have reduced the total distance of half cutting. Nineteen and a half miles of levelling, 40 miles of^ half cutting and miles of heavy cutting would be necessary. Total bl miles. Beducing this to half cutting for estimating purposes the distance would be 511 miles. The proposed road would be constructed similar to the present road from Daliki to Budak with a ruling grade of 1 in 20. I understand that 1,000 men of Indian labour would be available made up of Sepoys and Labour Corps, the balance of labour required would be Persian. Prom previous experience I estimate that 1,000 Indian labour would be able to construct a road in half cutting at the rate of IJ miles per month and Persian labour well supervised one mile per month. Six months have been allowed in which to complete the road. My estimate includes wages and working pay only assuming that the Persians feed themselves, but there is no doubt but that Government will have to ration them in which case their pay would be reduced from krans 3 per day to krans 2^ plus cost of ration transport. Two annas per day has been allowed as working pay for Indian labour, this item is no doubt slightly overestimated as the Labour Corps would not receive working pay. Transport of rations, etc , for Indian labour would also have to be added to this estimate, Cost of explosives have been put in the estimate also bridging materials, but botli of these materials are available here and would not require indenting for from India. Tools included in the estimate would have to be indented for from as our present stock is not sufficient for the men required. India Estimated Work.

I SHAPTJR VALLEY RECONNAISSANCE. ^ Itineraky. in First Day .—Party left Rahdar at 0 a.m. on 13th, general direction north -east reaching the ruins of Shapur at the Tang-i-Chikan gorge. Proceeding ie through this and traversing the valley the party camped about J mile outside II the gorge at the north-east end of this valley and within 100 yards of the is river. Here the river is split up into about six channels and all these go dry about ^ mile up stream. Village of Sayid Sans close by camp. Height by , Aneroid 2,540 feet. Water ample and good. &gt; it Second Day .—Left Sayid Sans at 6 a.m. keeping to north and north- 0 east bent of river bed (dry) a distance of some 12 miles when we reached the Bal Haiat gorge. Bal Haiat proved to be deserted and no water was found. Party therefore turned back and proceeded about four miles to Pir Abdul ’ Hasan a Caravan serai with shrine. Here there is fine spring of exceedingly 5 good water. 1 Height by Aneroid 3,295 feet. Third Day .—Left Pir Abdul Hasan 6 a.m. passed through the Eal Haiat gorge and commenced to ascend watershed to east. Pound cave with spring mentioned in Colonel Orton’s report. Mouth of cave triangular and small. Steep decline about lb feet long down to water. Water about 45 gallons. Owing to difficulty in drawing unable to check supply but consider it small. Cave is about 100 yards up hill side from Track and there is a needle rock due south-west from mouth of cave. This needle rock is a prominent object half way up face of opposite hills. Distance from Bal Haiat about four miles named Ab-i-Kurrah. Owing to our having had to camp four miles back from Bal Haiatand extreme difficulty of ground which for some miles consisted of steep slopes of slab where horses had to be led, we were unable to reach Kaleh-Mashizi but camped at Kaleh-Abdui. Here there are two fine springs of excellent water though not very large in quantity. One spring can be seen falling over the rocks to the south of camping place and the other about ¥ mile to the northTi, east in small valley can also be seen falling over rock face. Height by Anprnid feet. Exceedingly cold at night. Fourth Day .—Left Kaleb Abdui at 6 a.m. ^ descended north-west into valley and rescended alongside gorge to Mulla Nairn Pass, thence dropping to Dasht-i-Arian Plain about three miles from Dasht-i-Arjan. There is a spring of water which animals refused to drink half way down from pass on north east side of hill. A spring of good water was not a little way up ascent to Pir-i-Zan. Stayed that night at Mian Kutal. Height by Aneroid (caravan serai) 5,170 feet.

Here the path is difficult gradient varies trLendousIyf path ascending and descending with short grades of as much as 1 in 5. These wonl require cutting round totalling a distance of about } mile. Remainderof gorge about mile would require removal of huge boulders many of them as big as 1,000 cubic feet in size with border the present track. There is then plenty of width for a road. At the inner end of gorge the path opens into a wide valley through which the river runs. Here the ground is ^ fairly good for a distance of three miles half cutting would be necessary with about six Irish Bridges or culverts, the remaining three miles of valley would require slight levelling and cleaning of stone and outcrops of rock. Ground is hard and stony. The valley total length approximately six miles then narrows to a gorge about 200 yards wide through precipitous cliffs where the river at flood evidently occupies the whole of the opening. The general direction of the valley is north-east. A gallery would have to be cut in the rock at this gorge (south-east side) for a distance of approximately 100 feet and a further two miles of half cutting would be necessary. Bock is hard limestone. The road would then run along the bottom slope of range of hills to a point about three miles from the gorge where it would stride across the plain crossing the river by a bridge about 60 feet long (banks about 10 feet high) and would run in a south-easterly direction along the old caravan route which would require very little more than stone clearing and the cutting of drains (country very steady gentle slope about 1 in 200). Two very wide nallas (about 200 yards) are met here which would have to be crossed. The lands are low and the current would appear to be swift rather than very deep but in very heavy rains a considerable volume of water would probably have to be dealt with. In addition to this about 12 culverts would be required. Arrive at a point on the old track south-west of Bal Haiat the road would wind up the hill side to the mouth of Bal Haiat gorge. This gorge is narrow in many parts not more than 50 yards of which the greater part is taken up by ravine with the path on its south eastern side. The gradient is often 1 in 5 for short distances but frequently drops a little after each rise. There are a great number of boulders of large size which would have to be removed. The gorge is about J mile long. At least f of this distance would require full cutting or its equivalent in hard rock. Having emerged from the gorge the road would ascend along the face of hills to south-west of valley for a distance of about one mile then crossing over a bridge about 70 feet long to the north-east side would climb up to the watershed about four miles from Bal Haiat. To give a gradient of 1 in 20 the road would have to be zig-zagged to give a length of 6J miles from Bal Haiat to watershed: Height at Bal Haiat is 3,110 feet. Height of watershed 4,730 feet (by Aneroid). The whole of this six miles would require half cutting. Arrived at Top of Watershed, road instead of dropping would continue steadily rising up face of hill on north east side of valley a distance of some seven miles to the Mullah Nairn Pass. The height of the Pass is 6,240 feet. This rise of 1,610 in seven miles gives a gradient of approximately 1 in 22 so that road would require no zig-zags. Between watershed and Pass about five bridges up to 30 feet average span would be required but this is only judged from appearance through glasses. It was impossible to take the horses along and there was insufficient time to go on foot. The descent of the Mullah Naim Pass to the Dasht-i-Arjan plain is easy and would not require more than one mile of half cutting and a further 1^ miles of clearing and slight levelling. General .—The route on the whole is quite practicable. The greatest work would be in the three gorges (two at Tang-i-Chikan and one at Bal Haiat and in the Bal Haiat Valley). The chief difficulties to be the rationing of the working parties and the question of water. The latter difficulty would of course be non-existent in winter. The only portion of the route which need exceed a gradient of 1 in 20 would be a short distance of about 200 yards in the Bal Haiat gorge. Total distance-Eahdar to Dasht-i-Arjan main road 45|miles (approximately). Map attached.- r- —t , ju &lt;r SHAPUR VALLEY RECONNAISSANCE Sept. 21st. to 23rd. 1919.

Bahdar to Rudak, September 21st to 23rd, 1919. Itinerary .—Party consisting of myself and escort of one Havildar and 12 sepoys of l-117th Mahrattas together with six mules and two men of Mule Corps left Bahdar at six hours on 21st September and proceeded south-west along traces of old road running near the river. At a point about two miles from Bahdar we found it necessary to climh up by a very steep path to the higher plateau and again a mile further on to drop again to the river as the slope of the hills above was too steep for the mules. We reached a point nine miles from Bahdar and opposite the Northern end of the Kamarij range at 14 hours after very hard going and camped at this spot which was on a small plateau close to the river. Only one spring was found in this nine miles and it was highly concentrated brine. Next morning the party marched at six hours crossing and re-crossing the river several times and climbed on the higher ground having very great difficulty in getting the mules up. Party then proceeded over the north watershed and down the ravine between the Kamarij and the range of hills to the west. Here there is a spring of good water. We then ascended the ravine until we met the existing road at the Irish Bridge at foot of the Kamarijiand so entered Budak where we camped for the night to await arrival of motor convoy on the 23rd. I observed traces of the old Portuguese or Hutch Bond in several places hut the route it follows is quite impracticable and the gradients very bad. The proposed alignment should give a road with no gradient exceeding 1 in 20 and with about five miles level. Party consisting of myself and an escort of one Havildar and 12 sepoys of l-ll7th Mahrattas left Bahdar at six hours on the 21st September and proceeded in a south-west direction following the trace of an old road which follows the river. At a distance of two miles from Bahdar we met a ridge of hills which terminate in precipitous cliffs on the river bank and made it necessary for the party to ascend by very steep paths to higher ground. It was obvious at this point that if zig-zags are to be avoided in the proposed road it should follow, from Bahdar the course of the existing road to a point near the foot of the Tungd-Turken and then bend round to the north-east. The ground for a distance of three miles is comparatively easy with practically no cutting but from this point the road would wind in and out of a number of very deep nallas for a distance of four miles half cutting being necessary. At this point the end of the Kamarij range is reached the hills sloping down and terminating-in the river cliffs. The road would have to be kept at an approxi mate height of 2,500 feet. Prom this point the road would run along the western side of the Kamarij to the north watershed which is 2,290 feet high. Here it would be necessary to bend across to the western end of the watershed in order to gain height and recross it, at its summit, back to the Kamarij western face. The road would then continue on a southerly direction and practically level at a height of approximately, 2,600 feet to the southern watershed which is about f mile to the south of the present road. The new alignment would run across the highest ridges of the watershed and bend round towards the north to the existing Pass over the rear range and w r ould follow the first zig to its northern point then turning south would run straight along on to the northern face of the low hills lying to the south of the present road on the plateau above Budak. Having arrived at the point where the last descent to Budak commences the new alignment would cross the present road and run round the backGeneral. Height by Aneroid- Feet.

Dear Mr. Monteath, In reply to your letter of the 7th instant regarding our telegram No.343 to Sir P.Cox in which we refer to the question of railways in Persia, I find on reference to the xile that the Department of Overseas Trade sent us the promised Memorandum on future trade possibilities, including railways, on May 30th last, hut it was considered not altogether to meet the case and we did not send you a copy of it at the time, hut telegraphed to Tehran on June 16th (No,343).

The Persian Agreement having now been concluded, tne question of transport and commerce generally, which is dealt with in Article 5 of the principal agreement, will soon have to be gone into thoroughly and in the mean time it would be as well to keep the whole question in mind. I am sending you herein a copy of the Department of Overseas Trade Memorandum of May 30th and a copy of a minute thereon prepared in this Department.Copy.

The matter arose at the end of last year when a number of Groups came forward with proposals to run Motor transport on the various Military roads which had oeen built in Persia within the preceding twelve months. These groups w r ere (1) The Persian Transport Company. (2) peters Group of Ispahan* * * (3) Hussein Agha-Hapier Group. The Department of Overseas Trade which was consulted on all these proposals, replied regarding group 3 on the 15th January last stating that it 'appears undesirable to approach anyone in this 'matter until an adequate survey has been prepared 'of the position, setting out all the prior rights 'existing, (i.e. those of the Kiman Mining 'Syndicate, the Persian Transport Co., and the con cession obtained by Muin ut Tujjar and a number of 'Persian notables in Teheran some ten years ago, together3667/19. ^0860/19. 7087/19. 'together with any others of which the Foreign Office may be aware): embodying the best statement that can be made by the improvement of roads, or 'other transport effected by the Military Authorities end stating any other considerations which appear 'to be pertinent. When this survey has been prepared and con- 'sidered, it will be easier to decide whether British 'capitalists should be invited to investigate the 'possibilities of a comprehensive scheme of motor- 'roads and transport, and which particular financial 'interests should be approached or consulted in the 'matter.' On the 17th February the Department of Overseas Trade was asked 'to investigate the possibilities of a comprehensive scheme of motor roads and transport for subsequent consideration of His 'M&amp; j esty 1 s Gov eminent w # On the 10th April, the Department of Overseas Trade was told that the financial and military sides ^ of the Persian problem were engaging the attention of His majesty’s Government and it was essential that a 'comprehensive scheme for the furtherance of British commercial enterprise in that country and plans for the guidance of. our policy in this respect should be drawn up with as little delay as possible.” The particular attention of the Comptroller- General was directed to the question of Railway construction. Sir p. cox telegraphed on Hay 15th (No.364) that he was receiving many applications locally regarding motor transport and he asked to be furnished with the views of His Majesty's Government. a copy of- 77087/19. T 40251/19 of his telegram was sent to the Department of Over- *~6u.s Trade on May 25th with reference to previous correspondence on the subject and the Comptroller- General was asked to furnish a report as early as possible. The memorandum now received is the outcome of this correspondence, sir Steel Maitland states in his covering minute that 'it is impossible to 'present it as being a thoroughly considered view' which he 'can guarantee as practicable and desira ble in every aspect which it touches', and he adds that 'information will have to be gained from those puS^essing practical experience on the subject before we can commit ourselves to the suggestions 'in the memorandum as a final and definite policy'. Regarding motor transport the memorandum expresses doubt as to whether such a scheme would pay but states that in order to forestall possible competition, facilities should be given to persons anxious to experiment. The position in this matter is fully explained in Sir P. Cox f s telegram No.185 of March 10th of which a copy is attached. The three roads on which we have spent large sums of money are (1) Bunder Abbas — Tang-i-Zak - Kerman with branch to Saidabad and Shiraz. (2) Bushire to Shiraz. (3) Kasr-i-Shirin - Kermanshah - Hamadan. The money spent will have been wasted if the roads are not kept up, and if concessions are not obtained from the Persian Government the roads will revert to them and fall into disrepair. OfOf the three groups mentioned above the Napier Group which is well backed financially and comprises a Persian element would seem to be the one best fitted to undertake the Kermanshah road, while the others might be taken over by the Persian Transport Company and the other local groups to y/hich Sir P. Cox refers. The question of profit or loss is one for the group itself to consider and our only concern would be to help them to obtain the concession and give them Diplomatic support. Railways . The memorandum purports to deal with railways already in existence and ignores the Russian exten sion from Julfa to Tabriz and the branch line to the lake of Urumia. The proposed lines traced on the map (No.3) seem to ignore local conditions. The line from Khani* Kin to Kermanshah and Ramadan should be prolonged to nazvin and Toheran and not be taken from Ramadan to Burujird. The other-lines are a matter for subse quent consideration. The question, however, is one y/hich will have to be studied carefully in conjunction with the India Office, The Persian Railways Syndicate might eventually be invited to discuss the matter with an Inter- Departmental Committee in order to establish the exact route to be chosen and the concession to be obtained from the Persian Government. The financial aspect of the matter would also have to be gone into. In40251/19. 77087/19. In this connection I would point out that Colonel Wallace's negotiations at Teheran on behalf of the Persian Railway Syndicate, which have formed the subject of recent correspondence, seem to have oeen somewhat premature, Commercial Poliny . as regards our Commercial activity in Persia I do not think the conclusions in the memorandum cover the requirements of the case. (1) Is a self evident principle and the basis of the whole question, (2) We already have an expert at Teheran in the person of Mr. H. W. Maclean. Our Consular officials in the provinces a,re also able to assist. (3) The establishment of sample rooms should be considered in the light of past experience in Persia I venture to suggest that the services of Mr. H.W. Maclean, at present Attache to His Majesty f s Legation at Teheran, should be enlisted in this matoer as he is eminently fitted to give valuable advice on the whole question which requires local knowledge and special qualifications which he possesses. I venture therefore to suggest (1) As to Roads and Motor Transport that a telegram be sent to His Majesty f s Minister at Teheran in reply to his telegrams Nos.185 and 364 of March loth and May 15th respectively, giving the substance of the conclusions arrivedrr V '•&gt;, arri/ed at, najnely that the various roads should be run by Britis ^ Companies or Syndicates with Persian co-operation and that motor transport should be employed on them as far as possible, and asking for his views as to the best means of accomplishing this. (*-) as to Railways, that a meeting be held as suggested above. (3) As to our commercial policy, that a telegram be sent to Sir P. cox on the above lines. (Sgd.) G-. P. Churchill. 5th June 1919.Copy. (82349.) In reply to the Foreign Office Memorandum 77087/1/34 (Urgent) I attach a memorandum as requested on the possibili- ties of future trade with Persia including the question of Railway construction. The memorandum has been drawn up by an officer in the Department. It is, at the same time, im possible to present it as being a thoroughly considered view which I can guarantee as practicable and desirable in every aspect which it touches. It will need consideration both from the point of view of the far Office and of the India Office. Again, the suggestion with regard to tariffs, while forming part of the whole is a matter for the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office proper and for the Board of Trade proper rather than the Department of Overseas Trade. Lastly, as regards the question of Railway Steamships and otfosr similar matters, information will have to be gained from those possessing practical experience on the subject before we canMEMDRANDUI4 ON TI-IE POSSIBILITIES OP FUTURE TRADE WITH PERSIA, INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF RAILWAY-CONSTRUCTION. I. Summary of Existing conditions. (a f Amount of TraUeT The following figures represent an average taken for the two years 1913 and 1914, of the value of goods imported and exported by Persia:- United Kingdom to Persia. India to Persia. 439,000 Russia to Persia. 6,470,000 Germany,Austria &amp; Turkey to Persia. 1,120,000 Other countries to Persia. 3,021,000 £ 716,000 Total imports 11,766,000 ( Re-exports, India to Persia £499,000) £ 612,000 Persia to the United Kingdom Persia to India. 474,000 Persia to Russia. 5,492,000 Persia to Germany,Austria' &amp;, Turkey. 737,000 Persia to other countries. 973,000 Total exports. 8,288,000 The above figures show that roughly speaking Russia had before the warx 60% of the total trade of Persia, Germany, Austria and Turkey together 10%, the United Kingdom 6%, India 4% and other countries 20%, and that India in addition possessed a large re-export trade. They also% also show that the imports are considerably in excess of the exports. (b) Variations in the amount of Trade . When due allowance has been made for the large * fluctuations to which Eastern markets are liable, statistics show that, as far as the more valuable articles of commerce are concerned, a far steadier trade has been maintained during the war than could have been anticipated. During the period leading up to the war, Russian trade was rapidly increasing, owing to the opening of the Transcaucasian and Transcaspian Railways. British trade showed on the whole neither increase nor decrease.The following gives the trade with India for the fiscal year ending r* \ larch 1914.

The principal outlets are through the Caspian port, Snzeli, in the north, through Khorassan and the Trans caspian railway in the north-east, by the railway from Dusdap to India in the east, throu^i the Oulf ports of Bandar-Abbas, Bushire and Mohammerah in the south, by the Kermanash-Khanikin route in the west, and through Azerbaijan and the Julfa-Erivan railway in the north-west* Owing to the rapidity with which goods can be brought down by rail from Russia, and to the fact that the northern pro vinces 'which the Russian railways serve are the most popu lous and prosperous part of Persia, the two northern land--’ routes, namely those through Azerbaijan and through Khorassan, have attained an overwhelming predominance. The flow through these two openings was, during the period immediately before the war, greater than the combined traffic of all the other gateways of Persia* The bulk of British and Indian trade passes through the &amp;ulf ports, and has to work its way across the difficult and lawless regions of southern Persia, in order to reach the northern markets. Of the three principal ports, Bandar- Abbas has the best harbour, but the open roadstead of Bushire attracts more freight as transit to the northern towns is shorter from it. Mohammerah, though well situated as regards land-transit, is handicapped by a troublesome bar at the mouth of the river. India also carries on a considerable trade with the fertile province of Seistan and northwards, by means of the Quetta-Dusdap railway. (e) Transport and gommunic a tions T (see maps 1 &amp; 2) TransportTransport is almost exclusively by mule or camel alon&lt;^ ohe numerous trade routes which traverse the country* A iew vehicular roads have been constructed in the north, and the road through Kermansha and Hamadan has been improved since the war, but wagon-traffic has not in any instance supplanted mule or camel transport. The only railways actually in existence in Persian territory are the recent extension of the Quetta-Nushki railway across the border to Dusdap, and a few miles of line, laid during the war from Bushire to the foot of the neighbouring hills. Numerous schemes for railways have been put forward during the last 50 years, but His Majesty's uovernment has, for strategic reasons, consistently discouraged them. It was feared that British construction in South Persia would oe an incentive'to Russia to advance construction from the north towards India. Telegraphic communications are available at most of the large towns, some in connection with our Indo-European line, others erected and maintained by the Persian government. The postal service has been much improved under # . \ Belgian administration. W Shinning, Ships calling at ports on the Persian Gulf are, for the most part, British, and it was only a few years before the war tnat Germany began to compote* The principal lines are as follows;** British. Anglo-Algerian Steamship Co. Ltd.. Anglo-persian Oil Co. Ltd., Arab Steamship Lines Ltd,, Bombay h Persia Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., Bucknall Steamship Lines Ltd., West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. German. Hamburg-imerika Steamship Co.Russian. Russian Steam Navigation a Trading Go. (g) Banks. The Imperial Bank of Persia is a British concern with a capital of £650,000* The principal competitor is a Russian bank, but there are also several smaller native finns. II. Suites ted line of action. \&amp;) general policy. Since it is the general object of our commercial policy to import raw material and simultaneously to provide markets for our manufactures abroad, it would clearly be to our advantage to realise this aim in Persia, by stepping into the places previously occupied by Russia, G-ermany, Austria, and Turkey. If this were successfully accomplished, we should be in possession of about three-quarters of the total trade oi. I ersia, and in a favourable position to obtain the lead in the development of the country, before Russia again becomes » a fo^ihable rival, - as, sooner or later, she inevitably must hit f‘ ,rv ^ ° n aGGOUn ^ her geographical situation. The Persian markets, thou^i now depleted, would not take long to stock, moreover the high prices which can be realised at present would be an incentive to British traders to contribute towards subsequent schemes for development. However we shall not be without competitors; the Americans and Italians are already showing a lively interest in Persian trade; and the successful capture of the prize will become a matter of speed. It has been suggested that we could gain an advantage by uhe establishment of a system of motor-transport. In favour of this plan, it can be argued that railways would take too long to construct to be of any use at the present juncture, and that trade is hampered by the inadequacy of the existing ' animal transport. On the other hand, persons with local knowledgeknowledge differ widely as to the practicability of running motor lorries on the roads in Persia. It is doubtful, in view of the great expense of up-keep, and the very limited use to which they could probably be put, whether they could really become a paying concern. Under these circumstances we should scarcely seem to be justified in advocating the introduction of motors. At the same time, it would be wise to give facilities to persons who are anxious to experiment, for, should it after all prove more successful than is anti cipated, we cannot risk the possibility of being forestalled by some other nation. In the meantime, we work under no worse conditions than our competitors, as regards inland transport, and the best way to insure success would seem to lie rather inhelping and stimulating trade by intelligence. If by making the most of the present opportunity, we succeed in securing a predominating commercial influence, the door will then be opened to the larger policy of develop ing the country, so as to increase its resources, - and the most important item of such a development would be railway construeuion. Up to the present all proposals for making railways have been resisted on stragetic grounds. These grounds were of such a vital nature that no compensating commercial advantages could be pitted against them. However, it is now generally admitted that the policy of delay can no longer be maintained, and that the isolation of India by sterilising' Persia has become an anachronism. As the change appears to be inevitable, it would clearly be to our advantage to obtain the lead in construction while we nave the chance, rather than be forced to construct later unders under less favourable circumstances. For, by obtaining control, we can, at any rate, act so as to reduce the strategic dangers to a minimum and secure the commercial advantages to the full. It would therefore seem advisable to try to obtain a general concession for all construction from the Persian Government as soon as possible, (b) Important commodities. It would seem desirable to decide which particular lines of commodities are most worth pursuing, so that in the general development of trade, an eye could be kept to them first and foremost. The following are submitted as specially worthy of attention; Imports (to Persia) Exports (from Persia) Agricultural instruments Carpets workshop motor &amp; requisites, Gum tragacinth. plant for water, lighting &amp;c. Mother-of-pearl, oyster, &amp; Cotton manufactures, mussel shells Dyeing materials. oil Iron and Steel, and manufac- Opium tures thereof Raw cotton Sugar Raw wool Woollen manufactures. Wheat and barley Wood. Agricultural instruments, plant Etc; There are already - signs of a possible future market for such things, and if development of the country materialises, the demand will be certain. Cotton manufactures; The United A ingdom already does a larger trade in this line than in any other. The principal competitor was formerly Russia. Dyeing; materials; The measures taken by the Persian govern ment concerning the entry of fast dyes and the seizure of fraudulent dyes will contribute largely to an increase in the trs.de in the authorised synthetic dues. This will be further augmented by an increase which can be foreseen in the carpet industry as a whole. Iron k Steel, and manufactures thereof ; There is an increas ing demand for this line of goods in the North of Persia. ’heThe United Kingdom already posses a large share of the trade. The principal competitor was formerly Russia. Sugar; The United A ingdom already does a considerable trade in sugar. The principal competitor was formerly Russia. Woollen manufactures: The United Kingdom already does a considerable trade in this line. Carpets. There is an increasing demand in .America, and the steps taken by the Persian government to prevent the entry of inferior dyes will cause an improvement and consequent increase in the industry, as soon as fast dyes are obtainable in sufticient quantity. The United Kingdom already does a considerable trade. Cum tragacinth: This is an article required for cotton print ing. Russia formerly possessed a large share of the trade. Mother-of-pearl, oyster and mussel shells: There are valuable fisheries on the coast above Lingah, but only a small part of the take is brought to market, as the boats cannot carry them. Before the war, the trade was almost exclusively with * Germany. Oil. A large source of wealth, to which the Anglo-Persian Oil Co,, is already directing attention. Opium. The United Kingdom already does a considerable trade. The Smyrna district is the only other large producer of opium which can be used for morphia and medicinal purposes. With security larger quantities would be grown. China is the principal competitor. Raw Cotton : Should the United States put an export tariff on cotton, it might be necessary to supplement the supply from Egypt. Raw wool : The United Kingdom already does a considerable tradetrade in this line. Russia was formerly the principal competitor, some of the wool produced in Khorassan being imported to Russia and thence to England, iiifheat andjbarley: A large potential source of wealth. Southern Persian wheat is of finer quality them either the Mesopotamian or Karachi exports, and fetches a higher price in the London market. Lack of enterprise in irrigation, and of transport to the sea has prevented it from being grown on a larger scale. The export to the United Kingdom in 191k amounted in value to £364,000, but the trade has since ceased. * I&amp; od t The forests on the shores of the Caspian have been exploited to a small extent by Russian enterprise alone. Poplar, box and oak are common. (c) Railways. Once railway construction has been decided upon two problems arise; firstly that of the positions in which the lines are to be laid, and secondly the question of finance, in deciding the former, commercial objects must oe limited by strategic considerations. Thu accompanying map (No.3.) showrs a suggestion for the construction of a railway with 4ft. 8i in gauge consist ing of three loops in the south of Persia, with an offshoot from Ramadan to Kasvin, the proposal being to begin con struction in the West and work eastwards. This olan is advocated for the following reasons; (1) most of the principal towns, including the important northern group, are touched (Branches to Shiraz and the more remote Tabriz, Asterabad, and Meshed would be a matter for later consideration) (2) the main areas producing carpets, gum-tragacinth, oil,’ opium.opium, cotton, wool and grain are tapped. (3) the system connects with two ports on the southern coast. - Mohammerah and Bandar-Abbas (Bushire is an inferior harbour and extremely inaccessible on account of the mountains. It owes its present trade only to the fact that under existing conditions sea-transport up the Gulf is preferable to longer overland-transport to the northern towns) (4) the system links up with the Mesopotamian railway (having a similar gauge) and in case a practical outlet can '^ e for the latter on the Mediterranean, Persian trade will be able to share the advantages. If on the other hand, a mediterranean outlet is found to be impracticable, the Kasvin branch can easily be extended to join the Transcaucasian line at Julfa (although through traffic would be impossible owing to the difference in gauge) (5) In the east, the line connecting with the Indian rail ways gives easy access to Seistan, which is a matter of both commercial and strategic importance. From a strategic point of view this line should be no disadvantage, for if the Russians were to build south from Khushki we could build north west from Kerman. (The alternative which has been suggested of a line through Bampur and along the coast to Karachi would be too expensive to build for it to com pete successfully with sea-transport, and would moreover require a considerable increase of fleet' in Indian waters to defend from possible sea-attack) (Through traffic to India would however be impossible owing to the difference in gauge) The question of financing the scheme remains to be considered. Before any steps could be taken in this directiondirection, it would be necessary to have a survey of the proposed tracks made, so that some estimate of the cost of construction could be forced. Probably the best thing which could be done then would be for the government to approach some body such for example, as The British Trade Corporation with a view to the formation of a company for the construction of the first (i,e, the eastern) section of the railway. The government could lend the money at a low rate of interest and if necessary take a share. As however it would probably be inadvisable for H.M.Government to figure as a shareholder in a Persian Railway syndicate, this part of the arrangement would have to be kept rather dark.(d) SHIPPTO lo would be advisable to try and induce one of the larger fast-going lines to call at the ports on the Persian Gulf, This would probably be difficult to do, until such a line could be pursuaded that the prospects were good. However before the War the Hamburg-Araerika Line was beginning to cut us out in this respect, and the possibility ox some foreign line doing so in the future should be born in mind, A supply of coasting vessels to carry shells from Lingah would also be essential for the development of the fisheries there* If Bandar-Abbas is connected by rail with the interior, the harbour would need improvement* This could be done without great difficulty or expense. Sample-rooms should be established at the principal inlets for British commerce, i.e. Khanikin, Bushire, Bandar-Abbas, and Nushki. The revision of the existing tariffs with a view to increasing the Persian revenues, has already been agreed to. (e) PORTS. The question of dredging the river and lighting the bar below Mohammerah is already under consideration by the Admiralty. (f) SAMPLE-BOOMS (g) RATES AND TARIFFS . It would be well for us to take advantage of our positionposition as advisors to arrange that in the general increase of duties the commodities mentioned in section (b) of this memorandum should be affected as little as possible. In view of future railway construction, the insuring of favourable transit dues should be a matter for immediate consideration and agreement with the Persian Government. Any arrangement which could be made with the power 1 or powers who are to receive the mandate for Russian- Armenia and the new Caucasian States, in order to prevent heavy tariffs being put on goods passing over the Trans- Caucasian railway in the future would be an advantage, in the event of this line becoming the only overland route to Europe, (h) ROADS . Any comprehensive scheme for general development would naturally include road construction. However, as motor transport does not seem likely to be practicable this would be a matter of very secondary importance from a commercial point of view. (i) BANKS. If, as the result of increasing commerce, it were found that the Imperial Bank of Persia was unable to afford sufficient facilities, it would be necessary to induce some other firm, such as, for example, the British Trade Corporation to take up business in the country, (j) IRRIGATION . The irrigation of the southern and eastern districts should fomone of the most important parts of any scheme for general development. (k)00 GQVEKMvIENT- R TIPPOPT It is essential that qualified representatives should he sent to Persia as soon as possible to conduct our «r commercial policy on the spot. This would make it possible to supply intelligence to firms, and would make a favourable impression on the business community, for it is very apparent that traders will make no move unless they feel the government is behind them. (1) SUI^/iAHY QP ACTION SUC-C-ESTSD . The above proposals may be summarised as follows (1) to encourage British traders by every means to capture Persian markets now. (2) to send qualified commercial representatives to Persia as soon as possible. (3) to give facilities to British subjects or persons financed by British subjects, of good- standing, who wish to experiment with motor transport. (4) to try to arrange for a fast-going line of ocean steamers to call at the ports on the Persian Gulf. (5) to arrange for the dredging of the river and lighting of the bar below Mohammerah. (6) to establish sample rooms at the principal ports and inlets which affect our trade. (7) to obtain the widest possible concession for future railway construction from the Persian Government. (8) to arrange with the Persian Government for favourable transit' rates on future railways. (9) to survey those portions of the lines proposed for railways which have not already been surveyed. (10) to arrange for the financing of a scheme of railway construction on the lines indicated. (11) to arrange if possible to prevent the imposition in the future of prohibitive tariffs on goods crossing the Transcaucasian railway. (12) to embark later on a policy of general development, including railway construction, on the lines indicated, the improvement of the port of Bandar-Abbas, the provision of adequate vessels for the fisheries at Lingah, and the irrigation of the southern and eastern provinces.the 15th May* 1* Bandar Ahbas « Shiraz road* Details up to Saidabad are given in our telegram of 21®t February, 2,517* From Saidabad to Shiraz existbng track is fit for light motor traffic# 2* Bushire Shiraz road.

By telegram March 16th No.331 addressed to Teheran Government of India insists on abandoning work on Bundar Abbas road on the ground that His Majesty*s Government has ordered economy and completion for motor traffic would detain Labourer Corps two months and cost six lakhs of rupees. Plan of work has left most difficult point to the last and if abandoned now road will be completely blocked by rocks at several places. The only public work of permanent value effected by whole (group undecypherable) expenditure will be abandonee, in a use less condition and the conclusion which will probably be drawn by Persian opinion will be that the British Government intends to cut all losses in Southern Persia.

As far as Tamm the question of alignment of Bandar Abbas road has been satisfactorily settled, dangerous Tang-i-Zagh being]avoided as Lewis has selected Tangisadr eight miles further west. We examined this route and consider it much better than the alternative recommended by Rich ; perhaps the three alternative routes were not personally examined by Rich. Further north the question of alignment is difficult. The Icavir or salt swamp to the west and south of Sirjan is, according to the experience gained during the present winter of normal precipi tation, a fatal obstacle to that line, while recently we crossed a pass between Mr]an and Kirman with the greatest difficulty, having, m the snow, to use drag ropes constantly. We explored from Tarum to the north-west and found an excellent and natural route running towards Thalhalal and Katru (degree sheet ^ L 7 ?) a t a gradient of one in thirty over hard gravel. Near Saban there is one —AS 3 ass which is said to be very easy. This is being examined. It appears very suitable, the present difficult section Galun-PIajiabad being avoided. The road vould run from Katru north-east to Sfiahr-i-Babek-Rafsmjan and Kirman, the road avoiding all high passes and Icavir. A branch road would run down from rorth to Sirjan, while the present tempora-ry route would be open during thegreat- w part of the year. If this route via Thalhalal is adopted there will be a saving )f 100 miles on the journey to Shiraz ; and a large saving m time and transport is dso to be efiected. Ispahan would also be served by it. Its mam drawback is ts vicinity to Kohistan north-west of Furg whose tribesmen will be dealt wuh East of and at Katru and at some other points flankmg Kohistan P^s wd! be rormed.

Referred to the Secretary, 29th day of Auermt Political department. I am now in receipt of a telegraphic summary : of the estimate of the cost of the new telegraph line from bunder Abbas to German via Tarum and Saidabad. The estimated cost is;» Stores Rs. 2,55,900 j|dd Establishment Charges at 15 per cent 38,385 Add Storekeeping Charges at 3 per cent 7,677 Cash 3,90,400 Add Establishment Charges at 15 per cent 58,560 Total Rs. 7,50,922 say £50,000 at Rs.15 to £1 sterling. The reasons assigned for the increase in the cost of the new line in comparison with the cost of 222 74 1 563 1000 5/17 the existing line are:- (1) The increased length, viz., M2 miles against 264 miles. (2) The rates for transport and labour having considerably risen. (3) The rate of conversion of Kraus for rupees has been 4 taken at 220 to 100 whereas the rates were 320 and 280 tolOO for the quarters during which the existing line was under construction hence the amount to be disbursed in Persian currency when converted into Indian currency will be correspondingly enhanced. The figure given m my note oi jui), as being the cost of the existing line, viz., £35,720, omitted the percentage increases to be added on account of establishment ahd 'storekeeping'charges. The establishment7 s j ii. ' |; j 21 ' ' h i establishment charges at 15 per cent will amount to £5,358 and the storekeeping charges at 3 per cent to £508 thus the total cost of the existing line will be about £41,586 instead of as above stated. The anticipated increase in cost of the new line as compared with the actual cost of the existing line will therefore be about £8,500 C t ' The Treasury have agreed to contribute a moiety of the cost of the new line subject to a limit of £20,000. ft appears necessary therefore to now ask them to agree to the increase of this amount by £30,000, The Treasury contribution may thus amount to £25,000^ less 4 ^if the existing line is eventually dismantled^) a moiety of the value of the material on it after the cost of collecting t n • and storing it has been deducted. jlukcompliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the nnder-mentioned paper. reigyi Office, J?yv\$~0\/ O j ^ 2917.

The only estimate that can at present be afforded is that of the cost of the duplicate line, such an estimate is now being awaited and will be communicated as soon as tojpwn* The existing line, so far as is at present known, cost cash and £16,9^42stores^ but was constructeSwith metal posts; the duplicate line, in the absence of metallic posts, will be constructed df local timber, of which material I have not the requisite particulars to enable me to frame an estimate of the cost of building a line with it, Probably the duplicate line, in view of the increasing cost of materials and labour, will cost little less than the original line hence the cost of the two together will amount to the cost of the latWr, say £657(300, and this seems to be the probable maximum cost^while the previous estimate of £20,000 will be the minimum. This is as much as can be said for the moment.

It has oeen decided by Government of India that the telegraph line should be transferred from Dolatabad- Baft alignment to selected route via Tarum-Saidabad. It would be extremely valuable if advantage could be taken of presence of working party to construct further t elegr aph end telephone line from Saidabad to.Kiriz and,. Shiraz, This line which was originally recommended • \ by ne and was I think approved by you and Director, would increase hold on our only line of conminieafcion, would reduce robberies in that area and would provide alternative telegraph line to Bandar Abbas and India, There is congestion already on existing telegraph link to Kerman and Sircan.

I quite agree that a line of telegraph from Saidabad to Shiraz through hertz would afford a useful alternative means if communication to that existing with Shiraz via Ispahan and is one such as I advocated in one of my notes some years ago, viz,, that of 7th January, 1914, The direct connection of Saidabad with ¥eriz by wire would be difficult owing to the interposition of a Kavir or salt swamp to the west of the former. The swamp is thus described in the Route Book (Routes in Persia, Vol.III, Page 74)* • x -.x. .'T* 16 P la 4? ver y barren and gradually resolves itself into a salt desert. At IQi miles the edge of the kavir is reached. The route now lies over a hard smooth path, worn in the otherwise soft, rotten soil; in rainy weather the kavir becomes impassable and the whole tract a mere morass or bog. Further on the path lies for!while throudi a de£p layer of loose salt, and then the loose salt gives way to a sheet of the same substance, hard and highly crystallized, and not yielding to the tread of a horse, though at first only one or two inches in thickness; beneath this is brine, mud and water. The length from north to south is reported to be some 24 miles; but to the south-wast it spreads out into a very wide expanse. Its breadth at the part where the road crosses is about six miles. At about 20 miles the road runs again on the hard plain.' but qn alignment from ^eriz to connect with the line we are about to construct at a point southward of the swamp can be selected^ farom which point an additional wire erected on the posts of the new line would complete electrical communication between the two places.

Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive any observations which Lord Crewe may desiie to offer on the proposal at His Lordship’s early convenience. There is great need for a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman for the use of the gendarmerie and customs administration and the general public, whilst I understand from the Director of the Persian section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department that such a line might furnish a valuable alternative route for international traffic. He estimates that the cost of erection would be about 10,0001. roughly. If it is considered desirable it might, I think, be secured. I should be glad of your early instructions. With reference to my letter 52,285 of the 19th ultimo, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith, for the consideration of the Marquess of Crewe, a copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran respecting the proposed establishment of telegraphic communication between Kerman and Bunder Abbas. I am to add that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive his Lordship’s observations on this matter at an early date. As regards the discrepancy in the two estimates of cost given by Sir V.

ENCLOSURE No. 5 :—Note by Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department. dafo For Persia the need of a line of telegraph from Kerman to Bander Abbas is patent, and by any other Government would have been constructed long ago, but for international purposes such a line would not alone be of much use. carried through to -Task from Kerman for about 20,006l. His Excellency replied that he had long recognised the necessity of such a me, and would stronelv support its construction on terms similar to those under w inch Indo- European Telegraph Department hare put up othei lines. . Director of Persian Telegraphs here is much in favour of proposal, which appears however, to meet with some opposition in London.It Will be seen from the diagram of the departmental international circuits * ivr„+ attached' that messages arriving fr&lt; iSTot printed. 1 0 - -rom . . . the north at the southern end of such a Jme would under existing circumstances have no other outlet than by the submarine cable to Bushire to the westward, or by the cable to Jask to the eastward. This cable is at present fully occupied in dealing with continental, Turkish, and local traffic ; but when the second circuit by the Central Persia line, the filling in of the missing links of which has been sanctioned and will probably be completed by July next, is available, it may become possible to connect at Heujam one or other section of the cable to Bander Abbas or Kerman for longer periods than there is at present time for. But here, for technical reasons, a difficulty arises. To effect either the manual or automatic repetition of a message at Bandar Abbas it will be necessary to establish a station at that port with the requisite apparatus and a staff of at least three men to work it. The expense of such an establishment would hardly be warranted even if the men’s time was fully occupied ; but, seeing that the'only outlet, under normal working conditions, to the north is by the Persian wire from Kerman to Teheran, which could only be borrowed from the Persian Telegraph Administration at night and during periods of the day when they are not occupied in clearing their own traffic, the expense is not warranted at all. Moreover, the climate of Bander Abbas is such as to preclude the location there of more men than can possibly be avoided. If, however, a homogeneous overland line is constructed between Jask and Kerman, no intermediate station would be required, the distance being just under 400 miles. Such a line coidd be joined to a circuit from Karachi to Jask which now terminates at the latter station, and would thus help to complete a fifth circuit from Karachi to Teheran, the use of which, for international traffic, we could probably have for 10 or 12 out of the 24 hours. This would be useful, especially during an interruption to one or more of the other four circuits. In negotiating to construct a line of telegraph from Kerman to Bander Abbas we should, therefore, I submit, include an extension to Jask. Not that a line from Kerman to Jask wdll be much required in the near future, but in view of Sir Thomas Holderness’ letter to the Foreign Office, No. PAY. 1252, dated 4th June 1913, in which it is stated that the connection of Jask with Bander Abbas may eventually be required to complete one of the missing links in a line of overland telegraph from Karachi to Europe, via Mohammerah or via Bizful and Khorremabad, the proposal now made affords an opportunity of obtaining the concession the need for which was then predicted. Moreover, with an immediate reduction by fourpence in the rate for tele grams between Europe and India in prospect, to be followed probably by a further reduction later on, fresh circuits to carry the increase of traffic to be expected therefrom may be required in the near future, and, in order to distribute our eggs in more than one basket, it seems advisable to carry such circuits on alternative routes. Furthermore, if preliminary negotiations concerning the opening up of new routes, which aie apt to occupy much time, are already concluded, there will, vdien fresh circuits are required, be the less delay in constructing them. 1 understand from the Director of Telegraphs at leheran that the Com mandant of Gendarmerie at Kerman is pressing for telegraphic communication with Bander Abbas, a want which the Customs officials have long been pressing on the Persian Government. The merchants of Shikarpur, who trade with Kerman have petitioned His Majesty’s Legation on the subject m the past, and I was myself approached by the merchants of Bander Abbas nearly two years ago begging for a reduction in the rates for telegrams between Bander Abbas and Persia and Bander Abbas and India. It seems likely therefore that, unless we offer our assistance, a line of telegraph will be constructed by some other agency and the control of it by us may thus be lost. _ + , Q . Wol , The cost of the line from Kerman to Bander Abbas is stated by Sii \\ a t Townley as having been estimated by the Director at Teheran at 10 000L but I have since received a telegram Irom the latter asking that this may corrected to 14,000L I understand from Mr. King-Wood that this estimate of14,OOOZ. provides for a very light type of iron pole and a single wire with a view to reducing the cost of the line to the lowest possible limit short of resorting to timber for the poles. These poles are only made in the Alipur Telegraph Workshops at Calcutta, and it is doubtful if the Indian Telegraph Department could undertake to supply them, but apart from this they are quite unsuitable for international purposes, being made of thin sheet iron worked into a tapering tubular form which would rapidly corrode especially where exposed to salt-laden tropical sea breezes. Mr. King-Wood’s estimate works out at the rate of SOL a mile. The Indian Extension of the Central Persia line, 484|- miles long and containing 788 miles of wire, cost, about six years ago, 62L a mile, and when, within the next three months, 181 more miles of wire have been added, the cost will work out to about b7L a mile. For a similar line in Persia, owing to the higher cost of carriage and labour, and the recent rise in the price of material, it will not be safe to reckon on the proposed line costing less than 75/. a mile. A two- wire line from Kerman to Bander Abbas will therefore probably cost about 20,250/. instead of 14,000/., and a line from Kerman to Jask with a branch (about 55 miles long from a point about 177 miles from Jask and 215 from Kerman) to Bander Abbas, 33,500/. As some sections of the route north of the junction with the Bander Abbas line are in difficult mountain country, it will be safer to put the probable cost at * See Sir Walter Townley's telegram 34 50 () J. insteaf | 0 f 9Q 0 00i.» to the 1 oreign Omce or the lytn December. ’ „ . , . ’ . ... Before considering the terms wmcn might be offered to Persia for undertaking the construction of such a project by departmental agenc}’, it is necessary to submit for consideration a possible further extension of it. If German aspirations are to be diverted from the project for a cable down the Persian Gulf, it will not only be necessary to equalize the rate for telegrams between Germany and East Africa via Mesopotamia with that by existing routes, but also to deal with the traffic as rapidly as Germany could hope herself to do by means of an overland line and cable. With her proposed system she would be able to transmit a telegram from Berlin to Dar-es-Salam with only one manual repetition at the head of the Persian Gulf. With our existing system, manual repetitions would, I believe, be necessary at Fao, at Karachi, at Bombay, at Aden, and at Zanzibar. Although working through a cable from the head of the Persian Gulf to East Africa would, a^ explained by the Post Office, be slow, this would not so much matter if time is saved in repetitions. It seems necessary, therefore, for us to be in a position to do as much as Germany can hope to do, and if possible better. With an overland line from the head of the Gulf to Karachi there would be no more difficulty, in telegraph parlance, in putting Berlin through to Bombay than is now done daily in putting London or Liverpool through to Karachi. I his would eliminate two of the five manual repetitions I have mentioned. W hether two more can be eliminated, leaving one repetition at Bombay, the Eastern lelegraph Company alone can say. If they can, they will presumably be able to work at a better speed than Germany can hope to do, and the hopelessness of her trying to compete with them might then be demonstrated to her. It may therefore be considered desirable, so as to be forearmed, to negotiate also, when negotiating for a telegraph line from Kerman to Jask, if that course be decided on, for the construction in addition to a line from Lingah to + -f,v or f j ^ us hire,| or from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz, r .Negotiations tor a line from Bander , r it Abbas to Lingah have already been opened. t tllUS complete, except lor a cable across the Shat-el-Arab, at or near Mohammerah, an overland connection to Europe through Ottoman and Persian territories. I put up a sketch mapj showing the existing telegraph lines, and have dotted + Not rinted i n the projected lines mentioned in this A line from Bander Abbas to Shiraz is preferable to a line from Bander Abbas to Bushire, for the reason that Shiraz divides the distance between Jask and Mohammerah, by the Shiraz route, into more nearly equal parts thanBushire would the distance by the Bushire route, and also because the line would pass through a drier region which, for electrical purposes, is an advantage. 1 do not know whether a line from Bander Abbas to Shiraz would fall within the lange of practical politics under present circumstances in Persia, bat it seems possible that its establishment might have a tranquilising effect on the people of the country through which it would pass, and be thereby of benefit to Persia, who might open offices at Darab and Forg on a wire of their own which we could put up for them. The route was examined for telegraph purposes so long ago as January 1884 and pronounced to be quite feasible. There w'ould, of course, be less difficulty in running a line along the coast from Lingah to Bushire, but as soon as there are sufficient land lines to carry the international traffic the cables will have little, or none, of that class of work to carry, and will become therefore available to carry any local coast traffic that offers. A line from Baghu, the first stage out of Bander Abbas to Shiraz, wall, at 75L a mile, cost about 84,5001. So that the cost of the project with this addition will amount to about 59,000L Should it be decided to negotiate with Persia for the construction of this larger project on terms similar to those we obtained under the Convention of 1901 for the Central Persia line, viz., that we pay to Persia a rental of 4 per cent, on the capital cost of the line, which in that case worked out to about 5,000b per annum for a three-wire line 950 miles long, but of which w r e retain three fourths (3,750b) in redemption of the capital expended (125,000b) and pay one-quarter in cash (1,250b), it becomes necessary to calculate the amount of the rental of the proposed system on the same basis before drafting the terms on which negotiations might be commenced. The rental of the system from Jask to Kerman and Shiraz will, on this basis, be 4 per cent, on 59,000b, or 2,360b, of which the cash payment will amount to 590b per annum. To this must be added the cost of the inter nationalisation of the Borasjoon-Mohammerah line, which will, on the same basis, cost about 18,000b plus the cost of a second wire, 4,000b, or 22,000b altogether. The rental of this line will be 880b, of which the cash quarter will be 220b Thus, the total cost will amount to a capital expenditure of 81,000b and an annual cash rental of 810b We need not, however, inter nationalise the branch line of 16 miles from Baghu to Bander Abbas ; this will reduce the above figures by about 1,000b and 10Z. respectively, leaving the probable capital expenditure at 80,000b and the annual cash rental at 800b But before agreeing to make a part payment of the new rental in cash as we do for the Central Persia line, it may be thought better instead to arrange to reduce the liabilities Persia has already incurred or is to incur, in respect of the Central Persia and other lines, by a sum the interest on which at 4 per cent, amounts to 800b per annum, i.e. by 20,000b Some of the liabilities are the cost of the establishment employed on the construction of the Central Persia line 6,438b, the cost of the purchase and rent of buildings on the same line up to 31st March last about 4,635b, the cost of the construction and maintenance of the Henjam-Bander Abbas line, to the same date, about 5,000b, and, to be incurred, the Bander Abbas-Lingah line, about 4,000b. the Bander Abbas-Baghu line mentioned above 1,000b, and the Robat-Seistan line about 6 , 000 b . . The terms then that might first be offered to Persia for _ constructing by departmental agency a system of international telegraphs to link up Jask with Mohammerah and Kerman with Bander Abbas might be . Article I. The Persian G overnment having need of effective telegraph communication between Kerman and Shiraz via Bander Abbas, and the British Governmen being desirous of strengthening the international system of telegraphs trav ersing Persia by means of an overland telegraph line from Karachi to Mohammerah, mutually agree to construct a system of telegraph lines liking up Kerman with Bander Abbas and Jask with Shiraz, Jask bung ahead)s connected with Karachi, and Shiraz with Moha miner ah, by existing telegraph lines. Article IT. In order that the system may be constructed in a complete and effective manner, the Persian Government agrees that it shall be built under the direction and supervision of the British telegraph staff now controlling the international line in Persia, the British Government advancing to the Persian Government the salaries and allowances of the men actually employed on the work. Article III. The British Government agrees to procure for the Persian Government at a reasonable price all the posts, wire, insulators, &amp;e., that may be requisite for this work, and to arrange for the carriage of the stores to the sites required, receiving payment for the same without interest as hereinafter provided. An account of the expenses incurred for this purpose, and certilied in so far as they have been incurred in Persia by the Persian Telegraph Department, and in so far as they been incurred outside Persia by the British Government, shall be submitted as early as possible to the Persian Government. Article IV. The Persian Government agrees to lease the use and transit revenue of such sections of these lines as may be required to carry an international wire or wires, which are its property when complete, to the Indo-European Telegraph Department up to 1st January 1945, but in lieu of rent at 4 per cent, to that date to receive a lump-sum payment equal to one and a quarter times the capital cost of the lines, four parts of the total sum to be retained by the British Government to recoup them for the advances made on this account, and the fifth part to extinguish or reduce advances previously made by the British to the Persian Government on account of services rendered or to be rendered. Article V. The Persian Government agrees to lease the use of the Borasjun- Mohammerah line, which is its property, to the Indo-European Telegraph Department on like terms. Article VI. The maintenance of the lines, including repairs, and the appointment, control, and payment of the line guards, who must be Persian subjects, shall remain m the hands of the British Director and Staff, the cost being defrayed by tfi 0 Persian Government. The duties of the Telegraph Inspectors and line guards aie stiictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. ' Article VII. The protection of the line and of the officials, whether Persian or British, employed on it, shall be the special duty of the Persian Government, and should the English officials wish to proceed on inspections in districts proclaimed as dangerous by the Persian Government, they shall inform the nearest authority in order that they may be provided with an escort. Article VIII. The lines will be of two wires. One wire between Kerman and Shiraz will be used by the Persian Telegraph Administration for its local work and the other for international work. Both wires will be used by the Persian Telegraph Administration for local traffic on the branch line from Baghu to Bander x i as an ot i wires foi international traffic on the branch line from Shamil to Jask.Article IX. The same as Article VIII. of the 1901 Convention. Article X. The same as Article IX. of the 1901 Convention. Article XI. The same as Article XL of the 1901 Convention. Article XII. r lhis Convention shall remain in force until the 1 st January 1945, and at such date it may if necessary be renewed or revised, but &amp;c., &amp;c.’ as in Article XII. of the 1901 Convention. . ratifications of the present Convention shall be exchanged at Teheran within five months, or sooner if practicable. The Convention of 1901, which I have followed, was drafted by Sir Arthur Hardinge to meet the susceptibilities of the Shah and the Government of Persia of that time; since then the conditions in Persia have changed and the susceptibilities which wall now have to be studied will no doubt differ from those of the former period, and it is therefore hoped that it may be possible to arrive at a formula simpler than that of the old Convention and that a new Convention wall be able to avoid the ambiguities contained in the old one. To these ambiguities Sir Henry Kirk drew attention in his note of the 24th August 1909. In that note he remarked that under the terms of the old Convention we are in the strange position of having to pay rent for a ware the use of which is kept in the hands of the Persian Telegraph Administration. I would ho wever submit that the position with respect to the Central Persia line is not quite as anomalous as it appears because under the existing arrangement we obtain facilities for disposing of international traffic by the Persian wire when they are not using it for their own traffic and during interruptions to our own circuits. Under a more stringent arrangement they might not be as amenable. Nevertheless in a fresh project the opportunity may w r ell be taken of bringing this anomaly to the notice of the Persians with a view to reducing such other demands as they may put forward. An addition to Article II. wall have to be made making it clear that the charges incurred on account of the establishment employed wall be excluded in calculating the capital cost of a new project, as has been done in the case of the Central Persia line, although this exclusion has not yet been accepted by Persia. Clauses which do not appear in the 1901 Convention, but which have been included in the later agreement respecting the Arabistan Telegraph lines, may have to be added at a later stage. That, with the advent of the Baghdad Railway, w r e shall have to improve our communications eastward of it seems clear, and it is only a question of time wffien this expenditure wall become inevitable. I submit, therefore, that it may be advisable to be first in the field. Mr. King-Wood informs me that, although he tried hard a year ago to get the Persian Minister to allow the clause in the Arabistan Agreement of 1909, giving us a right to erect an international ware between Borasjun and Mohammerah to stand, the Minister remained obdurate. I his opposition was probably due to a desire to eventually obtain a rental for it. 1 have accordingly provided for this contingency in Article \ . of the dralt agreement. From the foregoing it wall be seen that the completion of a telegraph line overland through Southern Persia with a branch to Kerman will cost about 100 , 000 L, but it should be understood that the method of calculating the estimate of expenditure is but a rough one. The expenditure is not likely to be less than the amount stated ; on the other hand when it comes to be worked out in detail it may amount to 10 or even 15 per cent. more. Xo immediate financial advantage is likely to result from this expenditure as the lines will only be alternatives to existing routes, but with the prospect of a resuscitation of agriculture and trade in Mesopotamia and Southern leisia these lines may10 besides opening up a fast-working alternative route to Eniope, m time attract,* from India to those regions and vice versa, a valuable telegraph traffic. Moreover, our cables are so far, in spite of improvements in apparatus, too slow for the present-day requirements of through working, and all messages sent by them for Europe have to be manually repeated at -Feheian. _ This necessitates keeping up a larger staff at Teheran than would be required if these messages could all be automatically repeated there. ^ It will be seen fioni the map that aline from Task to Shiraz will not only piovide an impioved loute for the anticipated traffic with Europe through Iurkey, but also an improved loute between London and Karachi via leheran and Shiraz, and its development will, I anticipate, enable me to reduce the staff at Teheran, now some twenty-six strong, by half. The staff at Shiraz would have to be stiengthened slightly, but this could probably be effected by reducing the staff at Bushire by an equal num ber. It should also be recalled that between the inception, early in 1898, and the completion of the Central Persia line a period of nine years elapsed of which the preliminary discussion and the negotiations occupied three ; more than a year was occupied in procuring the material, the construction of the Persian section occupied a year and a half, the discussion on the route for the extension eastward and its construction occupied the remainder of the period. The expenditure was thus spread over a number of years, and the proposed project might be undertaken in a similarly leisurely manner. If however, the project as a whole is considered to be too ambitious at this juncture, and that only the Kerman-Bander Abbas-Jask section^ shall be negotiated at present, the terms which might first be offered to Persia could, I submit, be as follows :— Article I. The Persian Government having need of effective telegraph communication between Kerman and Bandar Abbas, and the British Government being desirous of strengthening the international system of telegraphs by means of a telegraph line from Kerman to Jask, mutually agree to construct a system of telegraph lines linking up those towns. Article II. In order that the system may be constructed in a complete and effective manner, the Persian Government agrees that it shall be built under the direction and supervision of the British Telegraph Staff now controlling the international lines in Persia, the British Government advancing to the Persian Government the salaries and allowances of the men actually employed on the work. Article III. The British Government agrees to procure gratis for the Persian Govern ment all the posts, wire, insulators, &amp;c., that may be requisite for the work on condition that the British Telegraph Administration shall have the use of the Persian wire between Teheran and Kerman whenever it is not being used by the Persian Telegraph Administration, and that they may erect on the telegraph poles between Teheran and Jask and Bandar Abbas such extra wires as they may need in the future for international purposes. Article IV. The maintenance of the line, including repairs and the appointment, control, and payment of the line guards, who must be Persian subjects, shall remain in the hands of the British Director and staff, the cost being defrayed by the Persian Government. The duties of the Telegraph Inspectors and line guards are strictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. Article V. The protection of the line and of the officials, whether Persian or British employed on it, shall be the special duty of the Persian Government, and11 should the Lnghsh officials wish to proceed on inspections in districts proclaimed as dangerous by the Persian Government, they shall inform the nearest local authority in order that they may be provided with an escort. Other Articies simikr to Articles VIII. to XII. of the Convention of 1901 for the Central 1 ersia line would, with slight modifications, follow, but they need not dg discussed liere. tt ar - e vv ^' n su ^ a ble modifications the same as Articles I. and ± 1 . or the 1901 Convention. Article III. is a simplified form of Articles III. and IV. of the 1901 Convention; the rental clauses have been omitted and the conditions we require to make it worth our while to undertake the project have been included. Article . is the same as Article \. of the 1901 Convention, but changed so as to make the maintenance of the line a Persian instead of a British obligation. Article V. is the same as Article VI. of the 1901 Convention, but omitting the clauses about buildings. When negotiations have been opened, we shall no doubt have to concede to Persia something further than is included in the Articles as drafted, e.g., we can as a first concession undertake the obligation to maintain the lines. I have only made the obligation in Article IV. Persian ” in order that its change to “ British may have the appearance of a concession. If a further concession is demanded, we might agree to lend the services of the staff, required to construct the lines, gratis. If the question of the payment of rental is raised, we can point out that the Persian Government has not yet settled with us for the Henjam-Bander Abbas line, and that we are not prepared to agree to the payment of a rental until they do. We might eventually agree, should there appear to be a danger of the negotiations breaking down, to knock off 1 , 000 L or more from that liability. The only buildings that will be required will consist of huts and stables for the line staff and their ponies. These*can be put up at a cost of from 200Z. to 300L, a sum so small when compared to the total obligation as to hardly make it worthy of being a subject of negotiation. I have therefore omitted the mention of it in the draft of Article V. The last sentence of Sir W. Townley’s telegram of the 19th December last probably refers to a message I sent to Mr. King-Wood informing him that I do not agree with him that a line from Kerman to Bander Abbas would alone be of use for international purposes. For this opinion I have given reasons above., The route of 'New Road A' I take to be that from Bunder Abbas by Tarum and Saidabad (Sirjan) to German, see Viceroy^ telegram of 21st ^ebruarv. (stma 'X' Viceroy^ telegram of 21st i^'ebruary^ (gree I submit that authority may be accorded to me to construct a telephone line from Tang-i-ZagJi to Kerman by the the construction of a telephone line from Bunder Abbas to Tang-i-Eagh. the purpose and because the ultimate expense will thereby be reduced I may receive authority to erect a wire for telegraphic purposes in addition to the wire for telephonic purposes. It will obviously be lees costly to put up the two ftires simulta neously than to go over the sane ground twice putting up a wire at the- time. A telegraph office is, I understand, much wanted at Tarum to connect the South Persia Rifles post there with the general telegraph system and its connection with Bunder Abbas and Saidabad telephonically will only effect this imperfectly. As soon as the telegraph wire reaches Saidabad from the south the Saidabad-Baft connexion can be dismantled and the wire used again between Saidabad and Kerman, moreover the Baft office will no longer be required and the staff will be available for While work is in progress in the south I propose to eonstruct a new line from Kaleh Mashiz to Keman and a temporary line 26 miles long from Kaleh Mashiz to meet the existing line at a point five miles north of Kaleh-i-Qazi so as to render the 56 miles of line between the same point and Kerman available for use between Kaleh Ma,shiz and Saidabad, by this the supply equivalent quantity of fresh material will be saved. The temporary connection will run along the valley of the A above route in extension of the authority already accorded to I also submit that since stores are now available for transfer elsewhere. Lalehzar where the country is easy. The attached skeleton mapmap shows the relative positions of the existing line in red and of the new route in black and I submit that authority to do this may be accorded. m The Treasury having agreed to 3hare A the coat of the transfer of the existing line carrying two wires from the old to the new route (P.1581/18) neeinot be again approached because the proposals herein contained only make the functions of the new line the same as those of the existing one and it seems to me that it is only necessary to notify the Government of India by letter that the Secretary of State has issued supplemental instructions to me in respect of the erection of a telegraph wire in addition to the telephone wire seeing that the Department is directly under the Secretary of State's orders. 9th July, 1918.
