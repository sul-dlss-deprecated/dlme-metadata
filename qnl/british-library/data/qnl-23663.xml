The details of a compulsory subscriber given in the Rule quoted above are not ob tainable from the annual establishment returns or from any other returns received in the Audit Offices, and therefore the Audit Offices are unable to apply any effective check over the realisation of subscriptions from the compulsory subscriber^. As the executive authority ia in the best position to judge of a subscriber's national ity as required by Rule 3 (a) (i) of the General Provi dent Fund Rules the Govermnent of India have, therefore decided that in order to prevent the recurrence of omis sions to recover subscriptions from compulsory suKwri- bera-to the General Provident Fund in future a report should be made by the executive authorities to the Audit Office concerned whenever an officer becomes liable to subs .ibe to the Fund under the Rule quoted above. Kfter the receipt of that report the reapongibihty for- recovering subscriptions from a compulaoiy subscriber will rest entirely on the Audit Officer.

It is one erf the primary'duties of 'ecy respoarible person to^ake provision lor his old age and tor his dependants .^oe the beet ways of making such a provision is to ta or an Endowment Assurapce Policy. 2 The Government of India have iMit«ted tfhe Po ?t Office Insurance Fund, which issues whole life policies as well as Endowment Afturance poHcies maturing on the policy-holder attaiumg the age of 45, iO or 55 as may be pBoposel by the insurant. 3. ill permanent Gow«meot servants in ci7« employ and •ermanent employees ol State Railways a« eligible ^ '° 8ut '= e , Wl ^ the P. 0 I. Fund. Permaaent servants paid from Local Fund permanent employees of Universities in India established by Government S unTr Government supervision are also eUg.ble fo. m.aranoe with the Fund. Certain ether elasses of officials can also take out P. O. I. policies. 4. The Chief advantages in insuring with the Post Office Ineumnce Fund are:— (i) The Fund is entirely managed by the Government of India. On the balance of the Faud interest at 3% per a*num is pa.d by Govern- ment at present. T u e 008 t of management of the Fund is very low, there being („) The cost B reflected in the low rates of premia no insurance agents to pay. luib o as will appear from the statement appended. rinN The P O.I. Fand issues policies even for such a small sum as {ooV for Che benefit of the low-paid ^. The max^.m sum for which postal insurance can be effected is Rs. 20, /.(iv) In respect of every policy, G«veriament arrange for the dednc- tion of premia from the salary of tbe policy-holder. The chance of the policy lapsing on account of the policy-holder forgetting to pay premia is eliminated. (v) The Policy-holder ie not considered to be in arrears for any month so long as he has not been able, due to circumstances beyond h.s control, to draw his pay or pension for the month immediately preoedmg that for which the premimum is due. (vi) If the policy-holder either retires or resigns or is dismissed from Government service, he can keep the policy alive by paying premia either month by month or for eeveral months in advance into any Post ©ffice (Head or Sub) in India. (vii) If the holder of a P.O.I, policy dies without paying the pse- mium due for the month in which liis death occurs, premium only for that month is deducted from the sum payable under the policy, It is not the practice of the P.O.I. Fund to deduct from the value of the policy in such cases the premium for the whole year in which a policy-holder dies. (viii) The monies of the Fund are managed entirely independently of the revenues of the Indian P. &amp; T. Department and whatever profit is made is distributed regularly every five years as bonu^ to the policy holders, without amy deduction for general reveoues. (ix) Government possess special facilities for the prompt settlement of claims on maturity or at death as the Head of the Department can, in most cases, certify to the identity of the beneficiaries. 5. Application forms for taking out P.O.I. policies are obtainable at any Post Office (Head or Sub) in India, from where any further details as to eligibility, rates of premia, etc., can also be obtained. If, in any case difficulty is felt in obtaining the application forma or any other information regarding the P.O.I, policies from the neighbouring post offices, such information may be obtained from the Head of the Postal Circle.

Sir, J _ to am directed to say that according/the Post Office Insurance Fud 4 Rules ? the proposal for the purchase of postal insurance Policy is required to be submitted through the immediate superior of the Governmont servant to the Principal District Officer, who, in turn, forwards it to the Medical Officer. The medical officer after recording his medical opinion passes on the proposal to the Postmaster-General, The fact of acceptance or rejection of the proposal is communicated by the Postmaster- General, and in the former case, necessary instructions for the payment of first premium are issued to the proposer. On receipt of the instructions the proposer pays the first premium and the contract is concluded. The premium is charged at the rate applicable to the age of the proposer on the date of payment of first premium, I am to add that, in some cases, the proposals are delayed either by ty&gt;e immediate superior or by the Principal District Officer with tho result that although the proposers submit proposals well in advance of their next date of birth, they are not able to pay the first, premium before they step into their next higher age. This results in the propoers being required to pay the premium at a higher rate, 1 3, I am, in the circumstances, to request that necessary instructions may kindly be issued to all concerned impressing upon them the necessity of dealing expeditiously Mth postal life insurance proposals.
