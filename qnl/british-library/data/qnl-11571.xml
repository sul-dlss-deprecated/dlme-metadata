It is situated on the top of a cliff above the tomb of this name. This tomb is situated on a beautiful and secluded valley in the midst of a dense grove at the base of a perpendicular cliff. It has two conical spires, one larger than the other, pointed, and supporting copper balls and crescents. The interior is a great vaulted apartment, like an ordinary mosque, and on an elevated terrace within it, and screened by green curtains, is the coffin said to contain the remains of Shekh Adi. Round this are spots where fires of bitumen and naphtha are burnt at the time of the annual festival. Sheik Adi was the patron saint of the sect of Yezdis, devil worshippers.— {AinswortL) SHEKH DARA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey.— [Chesney.) SHEKH KHAN—Lat. Long. Elev. The name of the chief family of the Yezdis of the Province of Musal in Asiatic Turkey. They reside usually at Badli and are recognised as the chief of all the Yezdis, whether Dassinls, Muvessurs or Dinadis.— [Rich.) SHEKI—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Shirvan in Georgia, Russia. It was conquered by the Russians in the war of 1813 from the Persians. Nukha is the capital. This small district yields a larger revenue than any of the Russian possessions south of the Caucasus. The silk alone it furnishes is 800,0001bs. The Khanate may contain altogether 20,000 families, chiefly Turkish and Lesgl, and 2,300 Armenians. The climate of the principal town is dreadfully unhealthy from June to October and is then little frequented by strangers. This district used to be much exposed to the incursions of the Lesgis. It formerly yielded a revenue of 70,000 ducats.— [Monteith). SHEKIRAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Mush, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of the Morad Chai and north of Mush. It contains about 60 Armenian, and affords winter-quarters to between 20 and 30 Kurd, families.— [Brant). SHELLIDA—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Kakhetia, Georgia, Russia, on the left bank of the Alizan River, 15 miles east-north-east of Telav. Here the rebels of this district suffered a decisive defeat from the Russian troops in the war of 1828.— {Monteith.) SHEMAMIK—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Kurdistan, the position of which is not clearly stated, but which would seem to be to the north-west of Altunkopri and between the Lesser and Greater Zab Rivers.— (Rich.) SHEMAMIK—Lat.

SHINKIS—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Kurds.—See Kurdistan.292 SIII S HIN SII AT— Lat. Long-. Elev. A division of the Kluirput district of the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey. SHIRVAN—Lat. 38° 31' to 40° 44' Long. Elev. A Province of the Russian Government of Georg-ia, which, with the dependencies of Talish and Sheki and the adjoining- territory of ShirvSn, occupies the space between the Caspian Sea, Daghistan, Elizabethpol, the river Kvir, and Azarbaijan. From the last, it extends about 135 miles to the limits of Daghistan latitude; and from the river Kur, eastward, about 110 miles to the Caspian Sea. Kinneir says the breadth varies greatly on the Kubas; it is scarcely 20 miles : near Ku'ba it amounts to about 40 miles, near the mouth of the Ata about 55 miles, whilst from the points of the Peninsula of Apsharon,nearest Baku, to the Kur it is about 160 miles. Including the district of Salian, it has a superficies of 10,386 square miles; and on the eastern side it consists of plains, whilst towards the west it is ver} mountainous. 'Ihe latter portion is traversed from north-west to south-east by the abutments of the Caucasus, from which other branches run southward to the Kfir, and again along the western side of Talish. The culminating points are the crests of the Caucasus, the Baba Tagh, Fite lagh, Boz lagh, Akhdib and Khanabat Taghs, all of which are of granite resting upon limestone, with some flint and clay towards the plains. Hie eastern side consists of an extensive plain, having the bifurcation of the Aras (the islands of Salian) and the banks t)f the lower part of the Kur in its centre : from thence it spreads northward, along the shores of the Caspian, to the district of Baku, and southward almost to the extremity of Falish. Towards the west there arc also some level tracts, but of limited extent, such as the plateau of Aftaran, the plain of Kassane, and the three productive valley plains running north and south between the mountains of Sheki. Ihe northern valley has a width of about 20 miles and extends nearly 52 miles westward from Shirvan Proper to the territory of Elisui, at the foot of Boz Tagh.* The central valley, which is more elevated than the other, lies between the Boz and Akhdib Taghs, and is about 45 miles long by 18 wide. The third constitutes the southern part of Sheki and has about 38 miles in length by 32 miles in width between the Kur and the foot of the Akhdib r lagh. The Caspian forms the eastern limits of these districts, the interior of which are amply watered by the affluents of the Araxes, the Kur and other streams. Southward the Bolgharon, after separ ating a part of Talish from Persia, runs eastward through the plain of Moghan, till it is lost in a reedy tract near the Lower Aras. The other waters in this direction are the Karaiar, the Ghorussan, the Odinabazar, the Lankan, &amp;c., with their affluents. Northward of the Aras are the Gokh Chai, the Gherdiman, theAk-su (white water), the Aighry (crooked water), the Pirsaghate, the Touriane, and the Demir Aparane. Nearly all the rivers run from the north to the south, and, with the exceptions of the Aras and Kur, are usually fordable after the spring months. In general the soil of the plains consists of a black loam, covered with rich pasture in the lower, and a varied luxuriant vegetation in the higher, part, especially in the valleys lying along the mountain slopes, one of which is expressively called the 'Valley of Roses.' On ascending the highlands the soil becomes clayey, and to this succeeds an unproductive chalk. Three kinds of climate are experienced in Shirvan : that of the plains is suited to tropical plants, such as indigo, sugar, &amp;c.; but the winters being293 SIII short, and the heat of summer proportionably great, the marshes become very unwholesome. Notwithstanding a considerable degree of heat, the second climate (along the slopes of the mountains) is healthy; and higher, in the third or cold climate, where the snow remains till May, the inhabitants live to a considerable age. Forster mentions that Shirvan is subject to fogs at certain seasons of the year. Besides tigers, panthers, bears, wolves, boars, jackals, &amp;c., Shirv5n has an abundance of buffaloes, camels, and other tame animals, which on the approach of summer are removed with the inhabitants to the fine pasture and wholesome air of the mountains. These flocks, the fisheries, and agriculture constitute the riches of the people. Their exports are equivalent to an annual sum of about £ 268,500, and their imports to nearly £ 232,900. Shirvan has but few permanent villages, and, besides ShamachI, the capital of the Province, only two or three towns, as Nukha, the capital of Sheki, and Salian. The latter town occupies the extremity of the angle formed by the bifurcation of the Aras. It is small, but important, owing to the sturgeon fishery. The inhabitants of Shirvan consist of nobles, priests, merchants, artizans, cultivators, and shepherds, and, lastly, the nomadic tribes, who amount to one-fourth of an aggregate population of 256,581 souls, descended chiefly from Tartar, Persian, Armenian and Hebrew stocks. The Jews are few, and the Armenian Christians scarcely number one-tenth of the Mahamadans, who are generally of the Sunni creed. The Tartar language prevails, but the Armenian tongue is likewise com mon ; there is also a dialect composed of these two. The Hebrew, which is spoken in this country, is much mixed with the Persian. The people of the plains and towns resemble in character the Persians, but the mountaineers, or more ancient inhabitants, are very different. The descendants of the Tartars are silent and cautious in their conduct; although hot and vindictive, their courage is not of a high order, and they are deficient in firmness and perseverence. Their chief amusements consist of horse and gymnastic exercises, in which they excel; and, unlike other Easterns, they take all the laborious household tasks, leaving to the females needlework and other light occupations. The softer sex have not, however, been improved in their morals by thus occupying their proper position in society; for though modest in outward demeanour, the women of the mountain districts lead irregular lives. The district of Shirvan Proper formerly yielded a revenvie of 100,000 ducats. It produces silk, cotton, rice and timber in abundance, and also wheat and barley. Many kinds of fruits, viz., apples, pears, grapes, and chesnuts, are produced in plenty. This was once considered the first province of Persia, north of the Aras, but was ceded to Russia by the treaty of 1724. It was, however, soon abandoned and did not again come under Russian authority till the treaty of Gulistan in 1826, when it was finally given over to that power. [Chesney.) SHIRWAN St.—Lat. Long. Elev. See Keyzer Su. SHISHA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Karabagh, Government of Georgia, Russia, south-east of Tiflis, south-south-east of Ganja, west-south-west of 13akir, north-north-east of Tabriz. It is built in the flat summit of a rocky hill, 400 feet above the level of^94 sin— siiu the Caspian. It is accessible only on the east side, which is defended by a thin stone wall, well flanked by towers. The other three sides are perpen dicular rocks. There are several springs of water at the top of the mountain, and also, strang-e thoug-h it seems, water is found at a moderate depth. The road leading to the east side has been principally made by the Russians; it has a steep ascent for nearly three miles, but it is practicable for artillery and loaded carts. The summit of the mountain has a thin stone wall round it four miles in extent. The town contains 1,098 badly-constructed houses, and the population consists of 5,289 Armenians and 4,572 Tartars. The situation is considered to be very healthy. The streng-th of this place has enabled it to undergo several protracted sieges, the most noticeable of which are those by Aga Mahamad Khan and Abbass Mirza. The delay caused by the want of success of the last in 1826, afforded time for the collection of the Russian troops, and led to the disasters to the Persian arms which consequently ensued. Shisha is celebrated as the place where Aga Mahamad Khan was assas sinated.— {Monteith—Chesney—Connolly—Stuart.) SHKHIYER.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, south-east of Baghdad. It is a place of considerable size, situated on a narrow peninsula of lowland, almost surrounded by a marsh. The huts are wholly constructed of reeds' which are tied in large bundles and neatly bent archwise. They are covered externally with thick reed matting through which the rain has some difficulty of penetrating. The reception hut of the Shekh is about 40 feet long and 18 feet high, blackened in the interior with the smoke and soot of years which have no other vent than the entrance at the extremity facing the marsh. Numerous huge reed baskets containing grain indicate the comparative wealth of the owners. The manly and expressive countenances of the inhabitants and they have a remarkable partiality for bright-colored clothing. They subsist chiefly on the rice produced in the marsh land which in January is entirely covered by inundation. The inhabitants of Shkhiyer are a. division of the Affej tribe.— {Loftus.) SHOLA VERA—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Georgia, Russia, on the road to Erivan from Tiflis. It is described as ' a pretty large place to judge from its apparent population'.— (T. Lumsden.) SHOROPAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A division of the Immeretia district of Georgia. It is governed by an intendant, assisted by two native officers.— {Chesney.) SHU an —Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Turkish Kurdistan, on the road between Sulimania and A-ltunkopri. Its soil, says Rich, belongs to Karkuk, its peasantry to Kur distan, and it sometimes depends on Sulimania and sometimes on Koh-i-Sanjak.— [Rich.) SHtTKASHO—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Baghdad Assiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Euphrates, one day's sail above Kornah. It contains a population of about 300 Arabs and is a most flourishing place for the Euphrates, which is navigable even in the driest season for boats of considerable burden as far up as this place (where the effects of the tide are also felt), and enables the inhabitants to carry on a trifling traffic with Basra. Shukashu is a great mart for horses295 SIIU—SIR and is famed for the richness of the clover raised in its vicinity. This is probably the same as Suk-al-Shekh.— {Kinneir.) SI DAK A—Lat. Long-. Elev. A river of Kiirdistan which rises in the west face of the Kandilan Mountains, and after joining with some other streams above Ravandiz, falls into the Great Zab below that place.— (Chesney.) SIDAKA—Lat. Long. Elev. A fort in the valley of the same name, in the Ravandiz district of Kfirdis- tan, which is situated on an isolated and bold projection of rock over the River Sidaka. It is a square enclosure, with four round towers at the angles, and with, in front, another curtain and gateway defended by two more towers. Before the fort is the village which contains about 100 houses. This is one of the Ravandiz Custom stations.— [Ainsworth.) SIDAKA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A considerable mountain district of KurdistSn on the line between Ravan diz and Cshnai; it contains perhaps 40 little villages, dispersed among 1 the clefts and ravines of the hills, and is inhabited by about 1,000 families from the tribes of Ravandi, Piresui, Baliki, and Shirwani. Sidaka formerly belonged to Amadia; but the Mir of Ravandiz annexed it to his own pos sessions, and it still remains attached to the Chief of that place, though at the time of Rawlinson's visit the Pasha of Amadia was preparing to reassert his claim.— {Rawlimon.) SIKAWA—Lat. Long 1 . Elev. A village in the Province of Mush, Asiatic Turkey, about 20 miles north of Mush, on the road to Arzrum. It is inhabited by Armenians. Near it is a small conical called Osp-polar which is celebrated as the scene of a desperate fight between some Kurds and the Grovernment troops.— {Brant—Pollington.) SIKNAK—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Kakhetia, in the Government of Georgia, Russia, east of Tiflis. It contains 623 houses, inhabited by 117 Georgians and 2,828 Armenians. It is beautifully situated, covering a round hill on three sides from the fort to the summit; the upper portion is encompassed with a wall, now partly in ruins, capped with numerous strong towers. This town is said to have been built' by the Czar Heraclius and was considered very strong; the Persians, how ever, took it and destroyed it. Siknak at present only contains a few thou sand inhabitants who are esteemed the bravest of the Georgians; but they are restless and rebellious, and have several times been severely chastised in consequence by the Government.— { J an Haxthausen—Chesney.) SIKNAK.—Lat. Long. Elev. A division of the district of Kakhetia, Russian Government of Georgia. It contains 56 villages with 6,666 houses, inhabited by 49,25-i Georgians and 3,968 Armenians.— [I an Haxthausen—Chesney.) SIMON ETTE—Lat. Long;. Elev. A village in Immeretia, district of Georgia, Russia, 12 miles east-south-east of Kutais, beautifully situated on an eminence with the river in front and noble hills beyond.— [Eastwick.) SINDIA—Lat.

A district of Turkish Kurdistan, apparently north-west of Sulimania.— [Rich.)296 SIR—SOK SIREJKIIAN—Lat. Long-. Elev. A villag-e in the Province of Musal^ Asiatic Turkey, about 30 miles north of Mflsal, and about 15 miles south of Badli. It is described as a considerable place inhabited by Dasim Yezdis.— {Rich.) SIVAN-MADEN—Lat. Long. Elev. An iron mine in the Province of Diarbakr Asitic Turkey, on the road between Khinis and Palu. It was workedwhen Brant visited it by the Pasha with the aid of Europeans, but the iron did not prove good and the enterprise was abandoned.— [Brant.) SrV ELL—Lat. Long-. Elev. A district of Turkish Kurdistan, north of Sulimania, and next the Persian Frontier, comprising- a part of the valley of the Sivell liiver, a tributary of the Lesser Zab Kiver.— [Rich.) SOGANLU—Lat. Long-. Elev. A range of mountains in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, and situated between it and Kars. The strongest feature on this line is, that they are so lofty as not to be free from snow till the month of August. Their sides are covered with extensive pine forests, and numerous branches of the Aras flow through ravines bounded by perpendicular rocks, which form, at short intervals, many advantageous points of defence. Two main roads lead over this formidable barrier, but there are several minor ones, though some of them are mere footpaths, and, according to Monteith, in 1828, generally quite unavailable for military purposes; but Keith Abbott mentions having met a string of carts crossing it. The road on the right bears the name of the Zavinn road from a castle of that name; the other is called the Mejingird road. The principal disadvantage of this line for the defending army is the absence of any cross lines of communication; conse quently a force occupying these two passes must be divided, and has no means of mutual support, except by a circuitous route to the rear. This range was forced by Prince Paskivitz in the war of 1828-29 by threatening the Mejingird route and attacking the Zavinn.— [Monteith) SOHRAN— A tribe of Kurds, the chief section of the Ravandi. It is an ancient and honorable clan, the chiefs of which conquered the Ravandiz country between 400 and 500 years ago, and have retained possession of it ever since. This tribe is limited in number, amounting to no more than 800 families; but from having given rulers for so long a period to the surrounding country, who frequently asserted and maintained their independence against both Turkey and Persia, it is regarded by the Kurds with great respect. Rich says that the Sob ran family was very ancient, but is now extinct, hav ing been ousted by the Bebbehs. Their chief town was Harir.— [Raw- linson). SOKOR ZOK—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, half way between Diarbakr and Bitlis, and north of Sart. ' It is,^ says Kinneir, ' situated on a small hill, and is governed by a powerful independent and hereditary chief who has under his orders many different tribes of Kurds, Yezdis and Turk mans of a martial and barbarous disposition, and who, it is said, can bring an army of 20,000 men into the field. The climate of the place is less severe than that of Bitlis ; the districts are extensive and covered with villages; but the population of the town does not exceed 6,000 souls/'— [Kinneir).STA—SUJ STAVROPOL—Lat. Long. Elev. A town, capital of the Government of Caucasia, Russia, situated on the left bank of the Atsehla River, 150 miles from Ekaterinograd. It consists of wide and well-formed streets, contains three churches, and has manufactures of soap and leather, and a considerable trade. Its population in 1849 was 13,968.— (Shiel—Imperial Gazetteer.) SUANETIA—Lat. Long. Elev. A country of the Caucasus, Russia, situated between Mingrelia and the crest of the main range, and comprising the valley of the head waters of the Ingnr. Very little is known of it; it is, however, said to be an exceedingly strong country and to contain rich mines of gold and silver, which are little known or worked, and its valleys are extremely fertile. The Suanetians have generally blue eyes and blond hair, and are a hand some and brave people. Personal injuries and quarrels are settled by duel \ the practice of blood-revenge prevails everywhere. Polygamy is not dis countenanced by custom, but divorce is prohibited; wives are purchased, and as the price is high (often as much as 60 to 80 cows) woman- stealing is not unusual. The traffic in boys and girls also is common, especially with the mountaineers in Circassia, and through them frequently with Constantinople. The price of a boy amounts to or 400 roubles, and that of a girl to half or two-thirds of that sum. The Suanetians, who were converted to Christianity by Queen Tamara, have retained scarcely more than the name; they have at the present day no regular ordained clergy, and, properly speaking, no public worship. Ihey assemble in the churches, some of these in ruins, for prayer, which they usually offer up before the pictures of the saints. There is, however, a caste of priests, named Dekonoses, who exercise a kind of supervision over the churches, read certain litanies in the public prayers, pronounce the bene diction at marriages in the name of the Trinity, and offer up prayers at burials; oaths are also administered in their presence before the picture of a saint. No part of the Caucasus is more interesting than Suanetia to travellers engaged in archoeological or historical researches; from its remarkable and colossal architectural remains, many of which probably date back to times beyond the reach of history. It is said that there exist in this country numerous churches of the Middle Ages lying half in ruins, which, accord ing to the tradition of both the Suanetians and Abkhasians, were built by the ' Dgenoves,' a name clearly referring to the Genoese, who in the Middle Ages either possessed, or had power over, the whole eastern coast of the Black Sea.— {Van Haxthausen). SUGAIT—Lat. Long. E1&lt; r v - • A river of the Shirvan district of the Government of Georgia, Russia, which falls into the Caspian on the north side of the Peninsula of Apsheron, rising in the hills above old Shahmachi.— {Kinneir.) SUKAM KALA—Lat. Long. Elev. A town and fort on the coast of Abasia, Black Sea. It is tortined and has a Russian garrison. The trade here is chiefly in salt and firearms.— (/w^r^ Gazetteer). SUJUK KALA—Lat. Long. Elev. A port on the Adighe coast of the Black Sea, Russian (royernment or Caucasia, south of Anapa. The first view of this harbour is extreme y 297 10298 SUJ—SUL beautiful; it has very advantageously the sea forming a small and deep bav surrounded by lofty mountains, the narrow entrance being formed by two projecting headlands as a harbour; it possesses little value, the bottom of the sea within it being so rocky that anchors have difficulty in holding. The Bora or the north-cast wind frequently sets in with unexpected fury, and strands the vessels with a fearful shock. There is a small fortress here. The ( ircassian name of the place is Terness; the Russian, Novorussiak.— (r an rLaxthausen). SlK-AS SHEKH—Lat. Long. Elev. M t0 ( 'ri ' a ' 1 e P ™T® e of Asiatic Turkey, the capital of the Montefik Arabs, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, 63 miles above the junction of the ligns and 99 miles above Basra. It is a walled town of considerable importance, containing 600 to 700 rami lies, according to Eraser, or 5,000 to 7,000 souls according to U inch ester. Its appearance from a distance is rather neat and attractive embosomed as it is in thick date groves, among which its houses are seen to advantage, liut a nearer approach makes the deception apparent, it is almost a mass of ruined houses, among which a few, still tenanted, contain ic survivors from the plague which lately depopulated Baghdad, and which (hd not spare the Montefik. Eraser said of all human communities he had seen, he thought this the most filthy and abominable. It was almost impos- sible to walk the streets without contamination; and the smell of the butchers , s iops rendered all approach to them impossible to civilised nostrils. The ba^ar is rather extensive, but sparsely tenanted. Most of the shops were ed with art'clcs su'ted for the Arabs alone,—spears, daggers, swords and shields saddles, abbas tent-ropes, &amp;c. There are plenty of grocers and uggists; loaves of white sugar, coffee, and coarse spices were abundant as well as the common articles of brown sugar from India, dates, soap, &amp;c! 1 he hade oi this place is very considerable; the quantity of sugar, coffee, drugs indigo, and all sorts of Indian produce which passes up the Euphrates in spite ol all dangers and imposts, is surprising; and much of several' ai tides, such as hinna, indigo, sugar, &amp;c., go all the way to Damas cus. 1 here really was somewhat of a bustle here. Dates are a great staple riom iiasra and were sold at verv low prices. Opposite the town the river is about 130 yards broad, 18 feet deep, with a current of two knots an hour The channel is deep, with steep banks, not mere than a couple of feet above the level of the stream, along which are many gardens, well supplied with vegetables, fruit and other trees, &amp;c. yraser—Chesney—Imj. enal Gazetteer— Winchester.)

It is situated in a hollow about two miles from the foot of the east range it ■ K u 18 l Whlcb l ' lo P e . d o™ to it. and among these, in a sort of may be abouTsO 0 yST* S ^Us are steep and bare; in height they299 SUL It is an unwalled town ; its houses are built extremely low, whieh gives them a mean appearance, though doubtless they are better secured against the snows and cold of this elevated region. The following description of the house Mr. Rich lived in will give an idea of the better sort at this place. It was a square building of one story, standing on a basement of about three feet high, and built of bricks dried in the sun, having a plastering of mud mixed with chopped straw over the whole. One or two rooms inside were white-limed over the mud coating. The roof was flat and formed by rafters, reeds and a coating of earth. The house stood in a large open enclosure: this was sub-divided into two courts by a cross-wall, which joined the house at each side near its centre, leaving the front in one enclosure and the back in another; this made the Haram and Divan Khana; but there was no communication between them by a door in the house itself; as in all Turkish houses, you had to go round by a door in the wall which divided the compound into two. The area of both courts was covered with grass and planted with willows, poplars, mul berries and rose bushes, interspersed in little bouquets. A stream of water runs through the court of every house in Sullmania, which is supplied from the mountains by an aqueduct. With respect to the distribution of the rooms, it seems regulated by no plan, only that in both the Haram and Divan Khana is a room quite open in the front, which is the general receiving and sleeping room in summer. No one but the poorest persons, who have not such an accommodation in their houses, sleeps on the roof. Some, indeed, in the greatest heats, which only last a month, use a low platform for that purpose; and during summer many construct huts made of boughs, over a little tank in their own courtyard, or else pitch a tent to escape from the fleas, which are a terrible nuisance. In the Divan Khana part of the house is a large vacant space or hall, sxapported by posts and almost dark : this is said to be a cool retreat in summer, but the pest of the fleas must still exist, and another still worse, that is scoi'pions, which are said to be numerous, large and venomous. Centipedes are also found here. The winter rooms of the house are entered by a long dark passage: their appearance does not invite a nearer inspection. The ordinary houses are mere mud hovels, which makes the place look like a large Arab village; they are perfectly exposed, but the people do not seem to regard this, the women going about with the men and performing their domestic labors without any veil. This miserable-looking town, however, con tains five khans, two good mosques and a very fine bath. The population of SulimSnia is estimated by the best judges among the Kurds at 10,000 souls, including the officers of Government and retainers of princes residing here. The ordinary citizens are of the peasant race. The public bath at Sulimania is superior to anything in any part of Turkey, excepting Damascus, Cairo, and Constantinople, and in some parti culars even excelling them. It is stuccaed and painted in arabesque, and ornamented with large cisterns or basons of water, with jets d eau. It was built at the expense of the Pasha by Persian architects brought here on purpose, and it is said to be the exact copy of the bath at Kir- manshah. Another, on the same plan, was constructed in the Pasha s own harem.300 SUL Mah^dMs?! 1 ^oftwtninfho^, rfChfldo 'c^r 'T' o{ zt r^T'' ^ o?

M. Niebuhr visited this part of the country in the year 1769 and found the people subject to a sort of feudal g-overnment. They are imagined to be the Cardu Chai of Xenophon, and their national character has descended unchanged from time immemorial. Sulimania is an extensive place and forms a central emporium to the neighbouring tracts of cultivation. The country which surrounds it is charming, the soil gravelly, as far as its immediate vicinity, when it becomes more sandy and of a light loamy nature. The tillage of the district excellent, the fields being neatly divided into square compartments for the benefit of irrigation. The commerce of Sulimania is not extensive and is principally carried on with the following places by the means of caravans :— Tabrez. —To which place a caravan goes generally about once a month, but this is not regular. They bring raw silk, silk stuffs, &amp;c. The raw silk is mostly exported to Baghdad; the stuffs are for the use of Kurdistan. The returns from Sulimania are principally made in dates, coffee and other articles from Baghdad. Arzrurn. —At least once a year a caravan goes from Sulimania to Arzrum. It carries dates, coffee, &amp;c., and brings back iron, copper and mules. Great purchases are made of these animals. All the best mules of these parts come from Arzrum. Hamaddn and Schna. —Once a month, at least, a small caravan comes from these places, bringing ghee, dried fruits, honey and steel from Kasvin. Karkuk. —With this place there is continual intercourse. The articles imported are boots and shoes, and some coarse cotton cloth. The returns are pulse, honey, gallnuts, sumach, fruits, rice, ghee, cotton, sheep and cattle. Karkuk is, in fact, the mart of all the productions of Kurdistan. Musal. —With Musal communications are also pretty frequent. The articles imported are boots and shoes, turban pieces, chintz and printed cottons, Damascus and Diarbakr stuffs, &amp;c. The returns are gallnuts, &amp;c. Baghdad. —The communications between Sulimania and this place are constant. The imports from Baghdad are dates, coffee, Indian and European stuffs, and cloth. The exports are pulse, tobacco, cheese, ghee, sumach, gum Arabic, tallow, and common soap. The tribes who inhabit that part of Kurdistan subject to the Pasha of Sulimania are as follows :— First. —Clans who are settled and inhabit particular districts. In the district of Pizhder the Sekkir, the Nurudin. Of these two tribes, there are about 100 villages, and they can muster about 1,000 musketeers. In the respective districts bearing their names— The Shinki, ... 200 families 1 These two are pure (jJlclliiCtS ••• ••• JLou )) j The Sivell. —The pure origin of these may be questioned, but they are at all events now a tribe and do not mix with the peasants. The other districts are mixed. Some inhabitants are of the peasant, some of the clannish race, i. e., no village has inhabitants of one exclusive kind. Second. —W r andering or Encamping Clans. The Jaf. —There are twelve branches of the Jafs. Of the true Jafs, there are not more than 600 families; but under their protection there are frag-302 SUL ments of all the tribes of Luristan and Persian Kiirdistan, which makes the whule streng'th of the tribe amount to several thousand families. The tube musteis about 100 iniantry and 300 horse^ that is to sav^ in their own defence. For the service of the Pasha they could not be prevailed on to furnish so many. The whole tribe only pay to Government a yearly tribute of thirty puises, sometimes less. Ihe other tribes pay much more in pro portion, because they are not so powerful or so well protected. 40 40 400 60 60 60 100 100 famiHes.

J he Jal s, being strong and well protected, are daily acquiring addi tions to their numbers from persecuted members of other tribes. None of the above tribes are entire; they are only fragments of tribes, of which parts exist also in the territory of Sehna, of K.irmanshah, or of Luristan. Sullmania was founded about the year 1788. The then Governor of Southern Kurdistan, Ibrahim Paslia, the father of Kurd Sulmania Pasha, and a iclation ol the present Governor of Siillmama, resolved on removing the capital from Karatcholan, on the other side of the Azmir hills, to this place; both from a wish of signalizing himself and for the convenience of hunting, of which he was passionately fond, and for which amusement the situation of Karatcholan was singularly ill calculated, being in a very narrow, rocky valley, lie called his new town Sulimania, in compliment to the then Pasha of Baghdad, Suliman Pasha, the father of the late unfortunate feyad 1 asha. 1 here was an ancient mount here, which they pared away to suit the foundations of the palace, which was built in the time of Abdul- llahman Pasha. Since the time of Riches visit in 1820, Fraser made a short stay in it, and he thus records its state at that period (1834) a The Pashalic has of late been the prey of an accumulation of misfortunes, which have reduced it to extreme misery, lirst came family disputes, civil war, two brothers striv ing for the supremacy. This brought in foreign intervention, as a matter of course, and the pashalic, which before had been dependent on that of Baghdad, fell into the hands of the Persian Prince of Kirmanshah Mahamad All Mirza. Intestine struggles and commotions, however, still continued and weakened both parties so much that, after the death of Mahamad All Mirza, their neighbour, the Mir of llawandiz, thought fit to overrun and appropriate a considerable portion of the territory to himself. I his brought on his head a war with the Azarbijan government, which had assumed authority over these parts and on unfortunate Stlllmania the maintenance of a Persian army, in addition to the payment of a Persian tribute. Ihen came the plague, which carried off more than half the people of the town and country; and of the remaining half, all that could, seeing there was neither relief from its inflictions nor any remission of imposts on303 SUL—SUV the part of Government^ emig-rated to places where the burthens were lighter, —to Kawandiz, Karkuk, Arbel, and other districts in the low country, ' Not a decent habitation was to be seen. None of the people, high or low, have had heart, or means probably, to repair their ruined houses, so that the huts that have arisen upon the rubbish of the old ones are of a meaner description than usual. The earth, too, of Sulimania, which forms the houses, is of so friable a nature, as to offer but little resistance to the action of the weather, mouldering down as soon as it is left to itself; so that by the operation of various causes the town has almost disappeared. The bazars presented a better show than I expected from the state of the rest; for though most of the shops were occupied by hucksters and retailers of trifling wares, they still made some appearance, and in the open spaces, where country produce was sold, a good many people might be seen, collected. I was told there were still from 1,000 to 1,500 families resident in Sulimania; but to judge from appearances I should think that the first- mentioned number, which implies a total of at least 5,000 souls, was nearest to, if not beyond, the truth.' The town itself, lying in a hollow, cannot be seen except from some sur rounding height, and the best view is to be had from two hillocks used as burying grounds, far better tenanted than the town itself.— [Mignon—Fraser —Rich.)

SLNAS.—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass over the Kurdistan Mountains from Siij Bolak, in Azarbijan, to Sulimania. The ascent from the north side appears to become steep from the village of Yalt Amir, and is very severe to the top which is reached in two hours and a half. The descent which takes two hours to the village of Nistan is rough over boulders and stumps, and along the edge of ugly precipices.— {Fraser.) ST T RAM A.—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruined castle in Kakhetia, Government of Georgia, Russia, above the Kur. It stands on a steep hill which rises isolated from the plain, and has evidently been the principal key of a general system of fortification. Jn front was erected a line of towers at about 1,000 paces from each other. The pass of Surem, 3,050 feet, is over the main watershed which connects the mountain system of the Caucasus with that of Ararat.— [Jan Uax- thausen.) SUVARAK.—Lat. 37° 46' Long. Elev.

Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs who inhabit the country between Miisal, Nisibin and the Khabiir. They are a very ancient and noble tribe, frequently mentioned in Roman history.— {Kinneir). TAK-I-KAISRA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A magnificent ruined arch which formed part of a building on the ancient city of Ctesiphon, on the left bank of the Tigris, 25 miles below Baghdad. Eraser remarks—' No one can view the Tak-i-Kaisra without being strongly impressed with the gigantic grandeur of the building of which it must have formed a part. There is no Eastern palace now which possesses such a facade, or, if we suppose it to have been merely a gateway, such an entrance. The Ali Capi at Ispahan, or the gates of the Palace at Dehli, magnificent structures in themselves, sunk into insignificance beside the Tak-i-Kaisra.^ TAKRIT.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, 80 miles above Baghdad, on the right bank of the Tigris. It contains about 5 or 600 houses with a caravanserai and two coffee houses. There are considerable ruins round it. The modern Takrlt, though consisting of a very considerable number of houses and governed by a Beg, is scarcely worth being called a town. It is built on a cliff and on the side of a deep ravine, and occupies the east part of the ancient city, the rivers of which are very extensive. Takrit stands on the right bank and is remarkable for a castellated building upwards of 200 feet high, with a vaulted staircase leading to the Tigris; the building is surrounded by a ditch and was once filled from the river. The cliff on which the old citadel of Takrlt stood is thus described by Captain Jones—' It bears evidence of former strength, and, being naturally nearly inaccessible, must have been entirely so when fortified. The front facing the river is quite perpendicular, and exhibits horizontal strata of stiff clay, red earth, fine sand, and conglomerate in successive layers, from theTAK—TAN waters' edge to its summit; indeed, this is the general formation of the cliffs bounding' each side of the valley of the 1 igris, from Samaria to i* it This isolated cliff is about 130 yards long by 70 broad, and in height 86 feet from the waters' edge; but the debris of the former buildings scattered over its summit increase it to a hundred in its highest part. Large massive bastions of lime and pebbles, faced with solid brickwork, abut around the cliff; two buttresses, of the same formation as the bastions, point out the situation of the gateway. The bricks which faced them have been canied away for other buildings. A deep ditch, about 30 yards in breadth, but now filled up with rubbish, conveyed the waters of the ligris around the base of the citadel, thus completely insulating and rendering it impregnable before cannon came into use. South of this, on another isolated hill, stands the modern town formerly girt in by a wall which has fallen to decay. It contains at present about 300 miserable houses^ and 1,000 inhabitants; but the space formerly occupied by the ancient town is of great extent. Some ruins called the Kanisah, or church, are stil shown. The modern town has two mosques, but no minarets. The streets are kept free from filth, and altogether bear an aspect of cleanliness seldom seen in Eastern towns.' It is said that on an emergency 400 matchlocks and guns can be collected for the defence of the place, and this is probably rather under than above the true number. It is, however, certain that the Takritlis have maintained their position against the Arabs, and even com- pelled the powerful Shekh of the Shamr to relinquish his intended assault on the place by the menacing attitude they assumed. „ ^ . Mr. Rich, 'in speaking of this place in the flourishing time of Dand Pasha, states that it was then farmed for ^,000 Constantinople piastres annually, and that it boasted at that time of 600 houses. I presume this must be a mistake, for at present, though its dwellings are but half that number, and its population proportionably small, from the effects ot t ie plague and other causes, the proprietor, or farmer, now pays yearly to the Government of Baghdad a sum three times as large as that mentioned by Mr. Rich. For 68,000 Constantinople piastres, or a sum equal to about £600. It is farmed. Fear of the Shamr on the one side and the Abeid on the other, has prevented the townspeople from extending their cultivation to its usua limits, and the consequence is, the rich land lying between I a lent and the HamrIn is now a perfect waste. The inhabitants are all Mahamadans, with the exception of one solitary Jew, who is on the staff of the (jovernor, and whose life is not to be envied. To the question of w 1a ia\e you in Takrit? ' 'One barren date-tree and an infidel Jew' is the reply. [Kmneir —Ross.) TALKH-AB—Lat. Long. Elev.

A river of the Government of Georgia, Russia at the junction of which, with the Gudara Su, Akhalkalak is situated. It flows through deep ravines with high cliffs.— [Monteiih.) TAR a BIZUN .—Lat. 4l , l 0 Long. 39'46 0 Elev. An important fortified seaport city, capital of the Province of the same name, in Asiatic Turkey, and situated on the south-east coast of the Black Sea. It lies at the foot of a high range of undulating hills sloping gently to the beach, and is everywhere well wooded. The houses outside the town are interspersed amongst trees and gardens, and shown off by the dark green hills immediately behind. Po the east of the town, on a small projecting rock, are the ruins of a castle, apparently byzantine. Tarabizun is divided into two quarters, the Greek and Turkish. The houses in the former are surrounded with gardens; the streets are extremely narrow even for an Eastern town. The houses in the Turkish quarter, which is within the walls, are generally larger and better built than those without, but have not the agree able appendage of a garden. This part of the town is connected with the suburbs by a high and narrow bridge on each side, and is defended by strongly fortified gateways. The houses in both quarters are mostly of one story, built of stone and lime, and roofed with red tiles. The town has neither inns nor lodging-houses, but it has 18 mosques and 10 Greek churches. The principal articles of trade in the bazar are alum and copper, brought from the mines in the interior, but the shops are well supplied with English cot tons and printed goods. The copper comes in a rough state and is here manufactured into different articles for domestic and culinary purposes. The commerce of Tarabizun has much increased in recent years, and espe cially since the establishment of steamers, by which this town has now a direct communication with Constantinople, Odessa and the Danube; and it still continues to be the chief route of the Persian trade, the goods being sent on by Arzrum. In 185^, there entered the port 88 steamers and 130 sailino- vessels; of the former 17, and of the latter 3, were British; and of the former 20, and of the latter 1, were Austrian; the remainder of the steamers, 51, and 120 of the sailing vessels, being Ottoman. The total imports amounted to £2,241,790. In the same year, 219 steamers and vessels sailed; the total exports amounting to £1,050,526. The exports consist chiefly of silk, wool, tobacco, wax, galls, oil, opium and other drugs, honey, butter, timber for ship-building, the produce of Asiatic Turkey, and silk fabrics, Cashmere shawls, carpets, saffron, cotton, and camel-skins from Persia. The chief imports are cotton manufactures, sugar, coffee, and other colonial produce, salt, wheat, &amp;c. Population, 40,000. (Imperial Gazeteer). TARaBIZON .—Lat. 40° 20' to 41° 30' Long. 38° 10' to 41° 30' A pashalic of Asiatic Turkey extending along the coast of the Black Sea; bounded, north-east, by the district of Guriel and Pashalic of Akhalzik; south, Aizium; west, Sivas; and north, the Black Sea. The picturesque beauty of the coast is particularly striking. The mountains rise immediately from the sea, from 4,000 feet to 5,000 feet, clothed with dense forests, composedTAR—TAU principally of chestnut, beech, walnut, alder, poplar, willow, and occasionally small oak, elm, ash, maple, and box, the higher parts being covered with fir. The country generally is so wooded and mountainous that it does not pro duce grain sufficient for the consumption of the population, yet not a spot capable of cultivation appears to be left untilled. The climate of Tarabizun is backward and liable to constant changes, chiefly owing to the cold winds, with rain and fog, which are brought across the Black Sea. Figs and grapes do not ripen before October or November. The vines are trained to large trees, the branches of which prevent the fruit from receiving the benefit of the sun's rays. Notwithstanding the generally mountainous cha racter of the country, it contains many fertile and well-cultivated tracts. Indian-corn is the grain usually grown, and it is seldom that any other is used for bread by the people; what the country does not supply is procured from Guriel and' Mingrelia. Hemp, linseed, wheat, and barley are also culti vated. The inhabitants are a hardy, laborious and bold race; they are skilled in the use of a short rifle, which every man carries slung at his back. The principal towns are Tarabizun, Keresun, Tireboli, Rizeh, and Jiatum, all on the coast.— [Imperial Gazetteer.) TARANJIEH—Lat. Long. Elev.

It was taken possession of by the Russians on the 25th July 1822.— {Kmneir Monteith Ghesney.) TASANTC—Lat. Long. Llev.^ A village in Georgia, Russia, on the road between Tiflis and Ganja.— [Mignon.) TASK KALA—Lat. Long. Elev. A Russian fort on the east shore of the KarasQ Bay of the Caspian Sea, built about the year 1830 to protect the fisheries of that nation. Its posi tion is singularly desolate— on one side the Caspian opening access to only two considerable ports of Russia, Darband and Astrakhan, and those fron tier towns; on the other side a steppe generally without inhabitants, ior all other objects but that of protecting the fisheries it is as ill-situated as it is ill-constructed, being shut up by the ice during the months of November, December, January, February, and March, and approached and left during the remainder of the year with the utmost difficulty owing to the shallow ness of the water and the intricacy of the navigation. From here to Gorief, the nearest Russian port, takes from three to five days.— TAOK Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Baghdad Asiatic Turkey, on the road between Tuzkurmati and Kakuk. It is very miserable and contains a post house ot 60 horses.— {Rich.) 307308 TAU—TEL TaUK CHAI —Lat. Long-. Elev. A river of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which rises a little on the north of Tuzkurmati, and passing- by Kara Hasan, is there turned off mlu many streams, as occasion requires, which irrigate the cultivation of several villages. In summer it is mostly consumed by the cultivation; then and in antumn its water is only about a foot or a foot and a half deep. It also waters many villages westward and northward of this; but at periods of heavy rain in the winter and spring, it is a most formidable stream, filling its whole bed, which is nearly half a mile broad, rushing down with great fury, bring ing with it large stones and forming hollows, which render the passage always dangerous and often wholly impracticable. The rise is sometimes so sudden that it has been known to surprise people when half way over, and they have often been lost or with difficulty extricated. When llich crossed t us river he found two streams of water in the bed; the first was about two feet and a half deep and ten or twelve yards over; the second about three feet and a half deep and twenty or thirty yards across, rapid, and with a bad footing, on account of the large round stones. This river eventuallv falls into the Adhem River.— (.Rich.) TAUL1K.—Lat. Long. Elev.

TAURUS.—Lat. Long. Elev. Hie name applied to the outer spurs of the Kurdistan range by ignorant ancients who considered it as one range. This extremely loose way of doscubing mountain ranges seems to be followed blindly by Chesney, and others. To me such a description is utterly incomprehensible, as it applies simply to the lower and outer spurs of several distinct ranges and not at all to the great ranges which emanate from Ararat. I hold that there is no such thing as the Taurus Range. None of the natives of the country know the name, and there never could have been one continuous rano-e stretching in one unbroken line parallel with the Tigris. TCHAR KAS OZAN.—Lat. Long. Elev.

Its current is generally rapid, over a deep and roc y bed.— [Imperial Gazetteer.) TERJAN Lat. Long. Xiiev. A plain in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, to the east of Arzinjan, about 30 miles south-west of Arzrum ; it is well watered and lertile, covered with fine villages surrounded by productive fields bearing the most abundant crops and extensive gardens, yielding grapes, melons and other excellent fruits in great plenty.— [Brant.)

They number 1,000 tents and are subject to the Shamr Arabs, to whom they pay tribute in money, grain and cattle. THARTHAR—Lat. Long. ^Jev. A river of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which rises m Jabl Siniar, north of Al-Hadr, and flows with a course parallel to the figris in o the'Lake of El-Milh ; at Al-Hadr it is from 15 to 20 feet in width and with 309311 TIF with Russian commerce in Asia, which, by way of encouragement, are exempted to a certain extent from the usual duties. The town consists of three distinct parts,—Tiflis Proper, on the east or left bank of the river; Kala, or the fortress, farther up on the west or right bank; and the suburb of Isni or Avlabari, with which communication is maintained by the bridge abovementioned. The streets, with few exceptions, are narrow, irregular and dirty in the extreme; and the houses present long ranges of dead walls, formed of large flat bricks and alternate layers of stone, the windows in which, owing to the dearness of glass, are for the most part filled with common or oiled paper. The general appearance of the city and the dark barren hills in the vicinity throw a kind of gloom over the place, though the streets are well filled with passengers who give indications of much commercial activity. The best part of the town is the Kala, where the Russians who occupy it have made considerable improve ments. The most remarkable buildings are those of the citadel, which, though in ruins, still presents majestic hoary battlements and towers; the cathedral, a very ancient edifice, of large dimensions and fine architecture; numerous other Greek and Armenian churches, several of them handsome; a Persian mosque, a gymnasium, and other schools; the Governor's house and other government buildings and offices; the Palace of Yermolof, a large and ostentatious structure, with good gardens; the arsenal, the Turkish and Persian caravanserais, forming double rows of piazzas, rising one above another, and only indifferently supplied with foreign goods; the bazars, with a good display of fruit and common and costly wares; and the baths, supplied from hot sulphurous springs in the vicinity. For recreation, there is a large public garden, laid out with fine shady walks and avenues; and there is also a botanic garden on the Kur, about two miles below. The manufactures include carpets, silks, shawls, &amp;c.; and the trade, chiefly in the hands of the Armenians, is very extensive, Tiflis forming a great emporium for the trade between Russia, Persia and Turkey. The staple articles of trade, in addition to the above manufactures, consist of immense quantities of Russian and German prints, handkerchiefs, and similar goods. Wine also, grown in the neighbourhood, is in great demand in the neigh bouring districts; but from being conveyed, not in casks, but in skins besmeared with naphtha, acquires a disagreeable flavour, not relished except by those who have become inured to it, and hence not much esteemed by strangers. The foundation of Tiflis, whose true name is said to be Tphilissi or Tphilis-kalaki, meaning ' warm town,' is attributed to a powerful monarch of the name of Vachtang, who about A.D. 469 subdued all the countries between the Black Sea and the Caspian. It was afterwards much enlarged and embellished, and rose to great importance. It was destroyed by Aga Mahommed in 1795, and though afterwards rebuilt, has never attained its former dimensions. The Russians became its masters in 1801. It suffered dreadfully from cholera in 1830. This town, says Van llaxthausen, has a peculiar aspect; on the side from which we entered, the quarter inhabited by Russians, it has a perfectly European look,—straight streets, rows of modern houses, elegant shops, milliners, apothecaries, even a bookseller, with cafes, public buildings, a Government palace, churches with cupolas, and towers. There are said to be in Tiflis 2'Z Russo-Georgian churches 15 Armenian churches, one Catholic church; also Persian and Tartar mosques, and a Jewish synagogue.TIF The Gorman colonists have a Protestant church in their village outside Tiflis But where this European town ends, one of a perfectly Asiatic character be gins, with bazars, caravanserais, and long streets, in which the various trades are carried on in open shops. In one part is seen a row of smithies, the men all hammering away on their anvils, heedless of the crowds of passers-by. 1 hen follows another row of houses, where tailors are seated at work in precisely the same fashion, and with the same gesticulations and agility, as with us. After these succeed shoemakers, farriers, &amp;c. In the level part ot the city, the newly-erected public and private buildings present an imposing appearance The roofs are often party-colored, commonly green t. ! t u raW 1 C 1 f 0r 1 appearst0 be the favourite tint of the Russians: and though this dull color is not very attractive when viewed close at hand, it has a smiling lively look when seen at a distance, especially where these modern Russian buildings are surrounded by dirty brown Armenian and Georgian houses. The barracks are naturally the largest and most imposing of the new structure. The residence of the Russian Governor-General which stands on the site of the ancient royal palace of Georgia, does not exhibit a degree of splendour proportioned to the dignity of an official who exercises unlimited authority over a territory larger than Germanv and t rance united. Amongst the more ancient edifices, the churches are* only distinguished for their size and their quaint, rather than picturesque, forms. ion cupolas, instead of presenting the usual curve, have a pointed and conical shape, a peculiarity of the Armono-Georgian style of architecture. Ihese domes, rising above the surrounding and humbler edifices, in vast and solid masses, resemble massive spires, and the variegated colors with which they are painted contribute not a little in throwing into uliet the foreign-looking and eccentric stone figures with which the buildings are decorated or disfigured. In proportion as the houses climb the declivity of ount oolalaki, the scene increases in magnificence through the diversity of the architecture. Phe forts and barracks, churches and chapels, bazars and caravanserais, gain immensely in picturesque effect, owing to their vast ma^ni- part of tliTeity p0Sltl0n ' aiul owm S to the amphitheatrical grouping of a Compared with the principal cities of the old world, renowned for the beauty of their situation, such as Constantinople, Genoa, Naples, Broussa, i rague, Salzburg, Algiers, &amp;c., with the Georgian capital the last place cannot be assigned to Tiflis. Irue it wants the diversified scenery of the incomparable panorama of Constantinople, the admirable distribution of its verdant shores and ol its beaming crystal waters, encircling the Queen of Cities with a sea of gems; nor does it boast the golden and colossal cupolas of theStamboulmosques the graceful tapering minarets, and the cypress groves of the cemeteries with their dim, religious twilight. Nor must we seek at Tiflis for the magic coasts of the Gulf of Naples, with its aged volcano, and the liar- momous lines and coloring of Capri and Ischia, dipping into the blue U l\r ye l m n n a PPf ni ^ a s ^ made on purpose to delight the art st But although liflis lacks the luxurious vegetation and the imposing ai chitecture of Broussa, as well as the thousand fountains that make merry music as they issue from the folds of Mount Olympus, yet the stern beauty of its rocky environs, the foreign and variegated diversity of its Oriental and .huropean architectiu-e, crowning the lofty banks of a wild mountain torrent present great and manifold attractions, even surpassing, in grandeur and 312TIF magnificence, the sceneiy of Prague, which has some resemblance to that of Tiflls, and is without a rival among the cities of Germany. In all parts where Russian builders have been employed, you find space, air, sun, and a free prospect, whilst wheresoever the old architecture has remained untouched the streets and squares are narrow and dark, although not to the same extent as in genuine Moslem cities. None of the streets are particularly remarkable; but the squares of Tabrez and Erivan, encompassed by modern buildings, are distinguished by their size and fine prospect, commanding the valley of the Kur and the Caucasian highlands. But the most remarkable spot in the city is the market place, which must be crossed in passing from the old to the new town. Its size is insuf ficient for the immense crowd of market people with whom it is encumbered, and who consist of Armenians, Georgians, Tartars, Ossetians, Persians, Lesghians, Russians and German colonists. One street, called the Great, runs from the bazar to the Square of Tabrez, and constitutes the main street of Tiflls, but it is unworthy, both in breadth and decoration, of a royal residence. The lower story of the houses is occu pied by narrow, dirty booths, and a great part of the Georgian and Arme nian operattves may be seen working in these open booths, exposed to the public thoroughfare. Tailors, cobblers, saddlers, barbers, and gunsmiths are especially numerous among these citizens, and the armourers' booths present the most novel and attractive appearance, exhibiting a rich assort ment of kinschals, schagchkas, pistols, and firelocks, both of Georgian and Caucasian manufacture. The most remarkable, spacious and profitable of all the buildings are the bazar and the caravanserai. The former, which is situated in the most animated part of the town, between the market place and the main street, cannot be compared with those of Con stantinople for size or diversity of merchandize, nor with that of Tabrez for the lively and entertaining character of the crowd that frequents it; but the bazar of Tiflis is superior to the former in elegance, an advantage which it owes to Russian rule. Nor has the luxurious nature of the goods, exposed for sale fallen off since the deposition of the royal Georgian dynasty. It is true that the choice of silk stuffs, shawls, carpets, &amp;c., is not so great as at Stambul and Tabrez, but it presents quite as select specimens of Perso-Indian maunfacture, to which the Russian nobles are just as partial as the native Georgian grandees. If you stroll through tbe bazar, which has a considerable analogy to the Passages of Paris, you are addressed and invited in Russian, in the most pressing terms, to walk in and inspect their goods, by the Armenian tradesmen, standing at the door of their shops. The caravanserai at Tiflls is not much inferior in size to those of the largest commercial cities of Turkey and Persia, and surpasses them in clean liness and in a certain architectural splendour, for which we look in vain in any Eastern city. Though the influence of the Russian policy • may be very oppressive in sundry matters, it has done more good than the contrary in establishing, cleaning and repairing the public buildings in the towns of Trans-Caucasia. There are no fewer than 42 churches at Tiflls,—an excessive number in proportion to the population. Of these, the Georgian Armenians possess 23; the Georgians of the Greek confession, 12; the Russians, 4; the Greeks Proper, 2; and the Catholic Armenians, onlv 1. The 313 lQ314 TIF cathedral, Sion, presenting a specimen of tlie purest Georgian style, is devoted to the Russian form of worship, and decorated with all the splendour which universally characterizes Russo-Greek temples, even in the steppes of the Cossacks. The population of Tiflls, according to Monteith, was, in 1823, 26,000 souls, of whom 15,000 were Armenians, 2,000 Georgians, and the rest Russians and others. Chesney puts it at 20,837 souls, with 4,936 houses, inhabited by 3,535 Georgians, 17,005 Armenians, and 327 Tartars. Wagner gives the number of houses at 3,662, of which 37 belong to the Government, 572 to the clergy, and the remainder to private persons. In 1848, the population was 30,925, and Eastwick, writing in 1863, states the number of inhabitants to be 40,000. The population [is no less varied and interesting than the buildings. Here Tartars, in the costume from which the so-called Polish dress is evidently derived; in another part thin, sunburnt Persians, with loose flowing dresses; Kurds, with a bold and enterprising look; Lesgis and Circassians, engaged in their traffic of horses; lastly, the beautiful Georgian women, with long flowing veils and high-heeled slippers ; nearly all the population displaying a beauty of varied character which no other country can exhibit,—an effect heightened by the party-colored, picturesque, and beautiful costumes. In no place are both the contrasts and the connecting links between Europe and Asia found in the same immediate juxtaposition as in Tiflis. The population of TiflTs comprises, beside the Russians and Germans {artisans, artists and merchants), representatives of three nations, Georgians, Tartars and Armenians. The Georgians consist partly of a numerous class of nobles, partly of gardeners, but the large majority are needy and live by begging. The Tartars are artisans, smiths, saddlers, &amp;c., and the Armenians, almost all merchants. There are few towns in which are seen persons of so many nations,—Rus sians, English, French, Germans, Persians, Turks, Tartars, Armenians, Kurds, Uzbaks, and natives of all parts of the Caucasus. In like manner, we here find all the various forms of religion,—Christians of the Romish, Greek, Armenian, and Protestant churches; Mahomedans, Jews of various sects, and even heathens. \ an Haxthausen visited the dwellings of these different peoples. The Tartars refused to admit him to the interior of their houses; the Armenians showed him little more than their shops, or occasionally a kind of sitting-room, and it was with difficulty also that he could induce the Georgians of the poorer classes to let him see their house. These rooms have a miserable appearance : in the middle is a small hearth, with a hole directly over it in the roof through which the smoke passes; on one side is a kind of closet, in which the beds are piled up, and on the opposite side another closet, or pantry, where* the food is kept. A few door-posts only were ornamented with some carving; a serviceable cradle was suspended on an elastic rod. The Geor gians, especially the women, pass the morning and evening, and frequently a portion of the night, on the flat roof, or the balconies and there is nothing more charming than in walking through the streets on a fine summer evening to see these handsome women dressed in their pretty national costume, sauntering on the balconies, playing, singing, and coquetting with the passers-by.315 TIF The following description may be taken as a specimen oi' the usual style of the old houses of the Georgian nobles of Tiflls. It forms a large q^ad- rano-le, in the middle of which is a spacious hall, with a vaulted ceiling resting- on two pillars and having in the centre a round opening, through which the light is admitted. From this hall and from a gallery on the second story which runs round the building a number of doors open into various small apartments, with windows on this side and others looking out upon the street. There are few houses of this description now in Iitiis the modern dwellings of the Georgian nobles beiugall built in the European style. The masonry of the modern houses in Tiflls is remarkably good, better than is usually seen in Russian buildings; Persian masons, who are saic o be the best in Asia, being employed. Their pay is a silver rouble and a ^The Armenians constitute above one-third (exceeding ten thousand) of the population of Tiflis: they are active, industrious, and enterprising, and gra dually acquire possession of the property of the idle and inactive Georgians; they make purchases, rent land, lend money, and are on this account greatly disliked: they are moreover thorough cheats. The Georgians have a repu tation for honesty, with one exception,—the common people are said to )e addicted to stealing honey and bees. A regular thief is, however, seldom met with among either the Georgians or Armenians; whereas the iartars have quite a passion for stealing, especially cattle and horses; they dish ce any regular occupation and follow agriculture only to procure necessaries preferring the breeding of cattle and a nomadic life. When they have no flocks of their own, they willingly take service as herdsmen, greatly preferring that of coachmen. They are frugal in their habits o y beware of showing them horseflesh! - m-/i The following particulars regarding the climate of Tiflis are taken fio Abich's paper on the country between the Caspian and Black feea : Temp, of Humidity, Humidity, Snow and air. abiolute. relative, ram, Winter, Spring, Summer, Harvest, 3213 55-44 75-67 58-10 1848. 1-40 2-79 464 3-26 0-79 0-64 0-58 0-69 0-800 7-736 4-205 1-475 Temp, of Humidity, Humidity, Snotc and air. abtolute. relative. rain.

' The course of the Tigris below the Hai is, as we have already observed, east by north, and it preserved that course, under the name of Shatt-el 'amarah, for about 28 miles; it then turns south by west for an additional distance of 32 miles, or as far as a spot close to Imam Crharbi, where it luis reached its greatest distance from the Euphrates; this point being 95 miles in a direct line south, 22° west from a bend near L mm-ul-Huntah on the latter river. At 66 miles by water, south, 57° east from Imam Gharbi, a derivation, called JEl Hud, quits the mam stream on the eastern side, and runs into the Kerkhah, near Hawiza. ' The direction of the main branch now tends south •34 east, and numei- ous irrigating cuts are sent out from it on both sides. At iU or 11 miles below Imam Gharbl the river changes its character in a very remaikable manner; instead of forming extensive sweeps the channel becomes deep and narrow, with a number of short abrupt bends. Itie tract about the canals is marshy and resembles that of Lamlum, to which also it corresponds in point of latitude; it may therefore be a part of the celebrated Chaldean Lake, which at the season of floods extended not only across Mesopotamia, but also to some distance eastward of the Tigris, so as to receive the wateis both of the Kerkhah a,nd the Karun. After passing for about 4U miles through marshes and coming near the tomb of lizra, the river resumes its former size and character, as it winds in the general southern direction, to Kurna, which place is 232 miles from Kut-el- amarah bj the windings, and 144^ in direct distance. The whole course thus briefly described may be estima ted at 1,146 miles, which is little more than half the length of the sister stream, the Euphrates, from the sources of the latter to their junction at Kurna; but it discharges more water, owing to the numerous tributaries which it receives on its eastern side, among which may be particulaily noticed the two Zabs and the river Diala. There are, however, as we have seen, only two feeders of any moment on the western side throughout the lung dis tance from Diarbakr to Kurna. j • i • r A considerable increase of the River Tigris takes place during the rains ot November; subsequently it decreases, and swells irregularly at intervals, till the different feeders are bound up by the frost and snow of January in the Kurdistan Mountains. This serious check retards for a time the swelling of the river; therefore its permanent rise, like that of the-Euphrates, does not usually begin till the middle of March; it is at ite greatest height between the middle and the end of May, when its velocity is 7-33 feet per second; and the discharge at Baghdad, in the same time, is about 164,103 cubic feet. After this time the river falls with more or less regularity and inequality till the middle of June. ' The large boats are not, however, obliged to dimmish their cargoes till the month of August, between which time and the month of November, when the river is again at the lowest, they should not draw more than tour feet of water. There is an active commerce along the Tigris between Basra and Baghdad by means of the large country boats, who go in fleets; and above the latter city it takes place chiefly by means ot rafts troiu Musal.'TIF The boats used on the Tigris are thus described by Captian Jones, Indian Navy— (vide drawing Quarter-Master General's Ofiice). aaci.

The native boat has holes to receive the lashings iii corresponding to the holes in bb ; for a ship, however, this would not answer, independent of the time required to make them, for it would render the whole weak, which at sea would require to be peculiarily strong. Lashings round all fastened to bb must be passed therefore to rageye, or ring-bolts driven into the sides of the stern-post, which could be done easily wlTile the rudder is being made; and until the lashings are passed the rudder must be kept as close to the stern-post as possible by means of several tackles fast to stout luddei pendants ggg that should be clove hitched, while inboard, round bb. leaving ends on either side to reach the quarter ports for clapping the tackles on to. These on themselves, witU the weight of the ballasted rudder, the projecting ends of aaa clamping the stern-post, and a stout upper lashing, which can be put on on deck, will maintain the rudder in its place with ease, the pendants being kept fast, even after the lashings are passed, for greater security.

V\ ith. this plan the rudder need not be two feet under water and the lashings entire y above. To the naval officer, experience will readily suggest any improve ment, as for instance, instead of lashings, stout strops with selvagee tails mi^ht be secured; while inboard, round the rudder-post, at convenient dis tance, whose ends, when the rudder was fairly slung, might pass throng i the eye or ring-bolts used on the side of the stern post cc, and then se taught from the poop or cabin windows by small jiggers, or by the most convenient method suggested at the time. In a well ordered-ship ot war, bearing several artificers, six or eight hours should suffice to put this tem porary rudder in action, and the advantages attending such despatch mig i be incalculable. I make no apology, therefore, for introducing so antiquated a machine to the modern reader, though a method ot fitting temporary rudders may be deemed foreign to a geographical narration; indeed, t ie traveller should notice everything within reach of his eye, and at the same time not be ashamed of copying the simple contrivances oi other nations for we may derive a hint from many an uncouth machine that, impro l upon, may benefit ourselves.

' On this pass is a well o naptha and salt and further south in the hills is another spring of naptha ^^•(wUch tt ^ T,,rkiSh an&lt;1 ^ m0Stly ISlJh ™ 0r ^TUZ—ULE The naptha pits of Taz Khormatti is in the pass of the hills about one mile south-east of the town, and being in the bed of the torrent is for some time overtlowed by it, and for a time spoilt. The pit is about fifteen feet deep, and to the height of ten feet tilled with water, on the surface of which the black oil of naplha tloats, small air bubbles continually rising to the sur face. They skim oif the naptha and ladle out the water into a channel, which distributes it into a set of oblong, shallow compartments made in the gravel, where they allow it to crystalize, when it becomes very good salt, of a fine, white, brilliant grain, without any intermixture of bitterness. Great quanti ties of this are exported into Kurdistan; and it is worth annually about 20,000 piastres, which is distributed among the different members of the family of the late dufterdar. Tne oil of naptha is the property of the village. Part of it is cousumed by the Manzil Khana or sold for its support, and part for religious establishments, &amp;c. About two jars, each containing six okas, * or one Baghdad batman, of naptha may be skimmed from this well in twenty- four hours. The spring is at the bottom of the pit or well; and once a year they clean the well, on which occasion the whole village turns out; victuals are distributed to all the poor, and sacrifices of sheep are made, to the sound of drums and oboes, in order to insure the good flowing of the spring again,—a ceremony, in all probability, derived from remote antiquity. The principal n iptha springs are in the hills, a considerable distance south of tms, towards Jvifri. They are five or six in number, and are much more productive than this pit A but no salt is found there. Indeed, it is probable that naptha may be found in almost any part of this chain. Near the naptha pit in the hills are alum and chalk of a very fine, close, white grain; but the natives make no use of these productions. An earth is found which they employ to give an acid flavour to some of their dishes; no doubt it is vitriolic. iSulphur is also found and is used by the peasants to cure the itch in their cattle and themselves. {Rich.)

Besides the Aras, it is watered by the Ghilan Chai, the Oustoukan Chai, and three other small rivers. There are five magals constituted by the valleys of Urdabad, Ailis, Dastine, Tchalanape, and Believe, the hrst of which contains the capital, Urdabad, and eight villages.

A town of capital of the Province of Van, Asiatic Turkey, south-east of ArzerGm, south-west of Bayazid, west-north-west of Tabriz, north of Musal, east-north-east of Diarbakr. It is situated in a large plain, said to be in 43 miles circuit, studded with villages and gardens. The imposing mountains of Warak, Sipan and Erdoz are in full view, bounding the plain on the north-north-west and south-east, while to the west lies the beautiful Lake of Van, distant one mile and a half. The rock of Van is a most striking object. It is shaped some what like a camel's back rising in the centre and falling at both ends. The ridge runs east and west, and is about 600 yards long, divided into three parts, each of which is about 200 yards in length. The rock stands alone, without any other hills in the vicinity and is therefore more remarkable in its appearance. The middle and highest part is separated from the two ends by dikes which are cut through the solid rock, so that each part is a separate fortification, the capture of either extremity by no means ensuring that of any other portion. The middle division is about 120 feet in height and perpendicular on the south side; on the north it is formed in part of a very abrupt rock and in part of an earthy slope, but very steep and strong; the height of the two other positions at the lower part is twenty feet, and the whole rock is encompassed with a wall of stones and earth, with bastions, some of which are square, and the otheis round. On that part of the north face where earth takes the place of rock, there are no less than five successive tiers of walls and bastions, i he town is placed under the southern face of the rock, and is enclosed with a wall of mud and stone, having large, round and small, square bastions, piotected, though not on all sides, by a ditch. The great charm and boast of Van are its gardens, which cover a level area of about four miles by seven or eight, situated betw een the city and the mountains to the eastward. This plain is occupied by \iueyaid8, oichards, melon-grounds, and some fields, and nearly the whole population of the city resides there in summer. The principal roads are lined with houses, and the whole appears like an extensive village. Ihe gardens are all surrounded by mud walls which interrupt the view as the ground is a dead flat. Ihrough the main avenues streams run, which are bordered by willows, and even at mid-day one may ride in an agreeable shade. The streets are narrow, dirty, and ill-paved; the external appearance of the houses in general mean: there is, however, to be seen occasionally a residence which shows that it had once belonged to a man of consequence; but the general aspect of the city indicates decay. Ihe bazars are confined and the shops ill-furnished, and few articles of European manufacture are to be seen; there is, however, an abundance of \ enetian glass beads, wdth which the Kurd females ornament their persons, ihe supply of fruit was superabundant. i m i The gates of the town are the Ortah Kapu, or middle gate, the Fabrez KapQ, or eastern gate, the nearest to the Pasha's residence outside the town, ■VAN ^ a f th /' . opposite extremity of the city, called Iskeleh Kapusi, or W hart Orate, a name given to a villag-e on the shore to the north of the city, where the boats used on the lake load and unload. The city is defended K a IT Wa . a Ch ' the mner wal1 beu1 ^ tanked by irregularly- s^aped towers; but the walls would only be an effective defence against cavalry or musketeers. s u Between the Tabrez gate and the Pasha's house, judging from the appear- anceof the ground, there must once have been a suburb. ^Ihe leh Kala or citadel is situated on a rock and has a separate wall and entrance ; part of the wall is ancient, probably of the same age as that ow Ihe buildings within are all in a dilapidated state and uninhabitable • but a few men are quartered here. On a platform is a battery of ^uns of various calibre, which are fired on the occasion of the Beiram, or the arrival 0 a i aslia. ihere is an immense number of guns on different parts of the works, but most of the pieces are of very antique shapes and unserviceable and scarcely one among the whole has a carriage in an efficient state. Within he outer wall, although outside the citadel, is a copious spring of water 1 he external works are partly stone and partly sun-dried bricks, and are so dilapidated and so unscientifically constructed, that as a fortress it is quite contemptible. I here were said to be 120 artillery-men for the service of the guns, commanded by a captain: the men usually follow their trades in the town and have no uniforms. The rock on which the castle is built is a long, narrow, isolated mass, rising out of the plain. It runs in length south-south-east and north-north- west Ihe south-western face is perpendicular, but the north-eastern slopes rapidly to the plain, ihe south-south-east end terminates abruptly, and the Son f'T iT eSt a f 0 . l the T ly aCCeSS - The hi ^ iiest P^ may be about ^UU feet ihe rock is about half a mile in length at its base; in breadth it varies; but at the summit, where the citadel is placed, it cannot exceed 100 yards although from the inequality of the surface it is difficult to iud^e correctly, ihe whole rock is of a hard compact limestone. The town lies at the base of the perpendicular side, and a wall encloses it, uniting with the rock at both ends. ?o P r?nn tl0n i 0f P the cit7, including the gardens, is estimated by le at i2,UUU souls, of whom 2,000 are Armenians, and by Brant at 5,000 Mahamadan and 2,000 Armenian families. In the country throughout the 1 ^shahc the Armenians outnumber the Musalmans. An immense number of the former, natives of the Pasha lie of Van, migrate to Constantinople, where they employ themselves as laborers, porters, &amp;;c. The town of Van contains two large churches, four large mosques, two baths and two caravanserais; though the streets are narrow, the town is tolerably clean; the houses are built of mud and, bricks, and contrary to the practice of Persia, where nothing but a gloomy wall meets the eye, every dwelling has latticed windows to the street, and many have wooden rooms at the top overhanging the street, where the Osmanlis sit and smoke Over every door the words ' Allahu Akber' (God is great) are inscribed. The bazars are few and chiefly inhabited by Armenian weavers and mercers. 1 he manufactures are the coarse cotton chintzes worn by the Kurds and iurks; cotton and corn are imported from Persia, for which money is paid. Ihe trade of Van is very inconsiderable, and is mostly in the hands of Armenians, and the consumption of European goods is insignificant onVAN account of poverty preventing people from indulging in their use. The position of Van, however, its soil, elimate, and, indeed, every circum stance, favours its being an important place of trade. Bad government and want of security are the only impediments to the development of the natural advantages it possesses. There are about 500 looms employed in manufacturing coarse calicoes from the cotton imported from Persia: these are used in the neighbourhood, and some are sent to Bitlis to be dyed red, a part of which return here for the consumption of the people. Besides these, Damascus and Aleppo manufactures are usually adopted for the clothing of persons of all ranks. What other things are required and are not found at Van are sent for from Arzrum or Persia. Shawls of Kirman are very generally used. . The country produces a few yellow berries gathered in the neighbouring districts, and the Hakarl mountains fur nish orpiment brought hither for sale; but there is no other article for export, except it be some fruits, dried and fresh. Grains of all kinds, fruits and wine, abound and are cheap, and linseed is grown for making lamp-oil. Every person of respectability owns a house in town, a country-house with an orchard and vineyard, and perhaps a few fields. Having thus his house rent- free and most of his very moderate wants supplied from his garden, or from the profits of a petty trade (carried on with a capital of from 20/. to 100/.) a man manages by economy to meet the expenses of a family ; few, however, grow richer, excepting some who follow the occupation of bankers and who manage generally to improve their fortunes. Persons not possessing the above advantages resort to Constantinople to obtain a livelihood. A good large garden with a house may be had for about lo0/.; oL would be required to pay a gardener, and the produce may be estimated at 15/., leaving nett 10/., nett 10. or 6^ per cent., a poor employment of capital in a country where the interests of money is usually 18 per cent, per annum. Ihe most valuable produce is that of the vineyard, which is, however, very precarious, as a premature winter cuts off the grapes. The juice is expressed and the must sold, the buyer converting it into wine. A batman, by which weight it is sold, equals iiO^lbs., and fetches about 1#.; grapes sell at about \d. per lb. for eating, apples 4^. per batman, bread about Id. per batman, and mutton about \d. per lb. It is evident, therefore, that subsistence costs ^-ly little. Five or six crazy boats navigate the lake of \ an and are sometimes emplo\ cd to convey raw cotton or cotton cloths to 1 advan on their way to Hit lis. llu y bring on their return grain and timber from the shores of the lake. Iheie is not a small boat on the lake, nor has any attempt been made to tish in the deep water. A small fish is caught in the spring in immense quantities, as it comes to spawn up the streams which flow into the lake. Baskets aie employed for the purpose, and the people catch and salt enough for their use, besides what they send away as presents and a very small quantity which they offer for sale. This fish resembles a herring and is much -esteemed. It would be a great convenience were passage-boats established on the lake. A person now has to make a journey of several days, not free from danger, which in a boat would only take a few hours, by crossing instead ot going round the lake. Encouragement should be given to fish with nets in the deep water. There can be no doubt that fish abound, as is clearly indicated by those caught in ascending the streams, and by the number of cormorants, gulls, and other waterfowl which frequent the lake. This is of an irregular shape; in extreme length from north-east to south-west or 10m mis 329 ls830 VAN—WAD to Tad van, about 70 miles, and in extreme breadth from north to south, about 28 miles. Its area may be 1,000 square geographical miles. It sel dom freezes at any distance from the shore, but the north-east end, being shallow, is in severe winters frozen, and the ice can be crossed.

The plain was extensive and pretty; the main range, a continuation of Arjerash Tfigh, but called here Erdash Tsgh, rose precipitously from it without any branches at its foot: its height was probably 4,000 feet above the plain, there being some patches of snow on its summit. \ illages surrounded by orchards occupied all the higher parts of the plain along the base of the mountains, and lower down were cultivated fields and pastures.

YEZDIS A religious sect who inhabit various parts of Armenia, but principally in the pashalic of Mfisal and the Sinjar hills. The religion of the \ezdis, according to their own account, is a strange mixture of wors up o\ ic ( cm with the doctrine of the Magians, Mahamadans and Christians; but among the inhabitants of Sinjar religion or religious ceremonies of any kind appear to be merely nominal, and never practised. As reading oi w 11 mg is quite unknown among them, and in a manner prohibited, their religion is only preserved by tradition, which varies among the different tribes and affords very incorrect notions as to their creed. Iheir greatest saint and patron is Shekh Adl who is supposed to have flourished about 500 vears a^o, and who is said to have written a sacred book, called Aswad, or ' The black,' containing their laws and precepts; but as none ot their divines can read, and as the book has never been seen y i . a ^ ^ 18 probable that they have invented this lie for the honor of their religion, since one cause of the great contempt in which they are held by Mahama dans is their want of any written law. The first and most important principles of the Yezdls are to propitiate the devil and secure his favour, and to support and defend themselves by the sword. They reject praters and fasts, as Shekh Adi has obtained indulgences for them all, even to the end of the world, of which they were positively assured by Shekh Adi. They consider the devil as the chief agent in executing the will of God, and reverence Moses, Christ, and Mahamad, as well as the saints and prophets held in veneration by Christians and Musalmans, believing that all these were more or less perfect incarnations of satan. They adore the sun as symbolical of Jesus Christ. They believe that there is an intermediate state of the soul after death, more or less happ}, accouling to the actions of the deceased during life, and that they will enter heaven at the last day with arms in their hands. They acknowledge as their head and as the mediator in their quarrels the guardian of the tomb of S u Adi, in the territory of the Chief of Amadia. This Shekh must be of the race of Yezd; he receives a portion of all their phmder, and has, as an assessor or adviser, another called Shekh Kuchak, i.e., the i ^ who is said to receive the direct revelations of the devil, and on pay ment o a sum of money, delivers his oracular counsel to those who consult him after a pretended sleep, with sometimes a delay of two or thiee nights. is held in great estimation and his orders are strictly tollowed. The Yezdis practise various religious observances, of which the follow mg are the most common. On the 10th day of the moon, in the month of Aug us , they hold a meeting at the tomb of Shekh Adi, which lasts a day and night, and at which all the married women and men assemble. Attei dark, the lights are extinguished, and they hold promiscuous intercom set morning. Near Ba'ashekbah, which contains 70 houses of \ezdis, 10 of332 YEZ Mahamadans, and '30 of Christians, is a fountain where they offer sacrifices of sheep and goats, and hold festivals four times a year in honor of the de 1 V 1 - * he m villa S® . 0f S1 ^ kh Adi i8 the % ure of a peacock in brass, called Mehk laus (King Peacock), which is venerated as the emblem or representative of David and Solomon, to whom they offer sacrifices and of whom there are images near the Melik Taus. ^The Sinjarlis are not cncumcised, but the Yezdis of Kurdistan are said to practise circumcision on the eighth day after birth. The children are baptized when six or seven years old, but no prayers are used on that occasion. They have no fixed time or place for prayer or worship; they occasionally visit the Christian churches and monasteries, and present offerings there on account of recovery from sickness, or escape from danger; they also kiss the superior's hand. The Shekhs have great influence, and pretend to insure the admission of a soul into heaven by a number of ridiculous ceremonies performed over the corpse. It is first placed on its feet, they then touch the neck and shoulders, and, with their palm stretched out, strike the ri-ht palm of the dead body, saying at the same time, a Ara behesht,' i.e., away to Paiadise ! Hie Shekhs also pretend to cure the sick by imposition of hands. It is considered a great thing to obtain for a winding-sheet one of the old shirts or dresses of the guardian of f Adi's tomb/ This, they believe insures them a good place in the other world. They give large sums of money for these shirts, or even pieces of them ; and the Shekh sometimes presents one to a particular friend, as the greatest favour he can bestow. The spiritual directors are much respected by all classes of the people, who, when they meet them, kiss their right hand. They are distinguished for the most part by wearing a white turban and a black woollen cloak. The families of the holy men only intermarry with each other. Hie \ ezdis have, like all other barbarous tribes, many superstitious observances, some of which are peculiar to themselves. From the reverence paid to the Evil Spirit, they do not use in naming him any of the common epithets, as these are all more or less expressive of horror, contempt, or abomination ; nor will they suffer them to be used in their presence. This is particularly the case with regard to the word Sheitan, and all other words resembling it in sound, as Shatt, a river. Instead of using the word Shei tan, they designate the devil as Shekh Mazen, i.e., the exalted doctor, or chief; and in place of Shatt, they use the common Kurdish word aVg Cab), or the Arabic ma, signifying water. Speaking of the Euphrates they term it A've Mazen, or Mai Kebir, i.e., the Great water, or simply El Por&amp;t, Mazen being a corruption of the Arabic Mo'azzem. As the word La'net is often applied by Mahamadans to the devil, a common expression of the Persians, on meeting a Yezdi, being ' Lanet bih Sheitan/ or curses on the Devil, the Yezidis never use any word which consists of the same letters, as Na 1, a horse-shoe, or Na'lbund, a farrier. It is con sidered by them a great insult to spit in their presence or to spit into the fire. They use nearly the same oaths as the Turks, Christians, and Jews indiscriminately; but that which to them is most binding is to swear by the standard of \ezd. They used formerly to dress in blue, but it is now considered an unlucky color, and white only is worn. The domestic manners of the Yezdis and their customs in general are very simple. Both men and women are of middle size, and have a clear complexion, with regular features and black eyes and hair, their limbs beingYEZ spare, muscular, and well-proportioned. The hair is worn long, and the board and whiskers kept close shorn; but they are prohibited from cutting or dress ing- their moustachios. The dress of the men consists of a long white cotton sown and cotton drawers, a leathern girdle, a camel s hair skullcap, with a niece of black or checked cotton tied round it, and sandals of raw hide. The women wear a long white cotton gown, with very long wide sleeves which are thrown back over the shoulders and tied round the waist: over this is put a strange looking garment of black woollen or sometimes of party coloured stuff. This covers the back part of the chest and descends in two long narrow stripes or tails nearly to the ground; two narrow bands also come from behind forwards and are fastened round the waist like a o-irdle. A quantity of white cotton cloth is rolled round the head in th^shape of a pointed hood and tied nnder the chin. The women do not, like the Mahamadans, conceal their faces, but go about their house hold concerns and mix with the men as in European countries. This, however, is commonly done throughout Mesopotamia and Asia Minor, except in large cities. The houses of the Sinjarlis are generally low, with flat roots, around the edges of which is piled, in the form of a parapet, their stock of fire wood, withered leaves and branches for heating their ovens, iheir houses are very clean and comfortable, but awkwardly built of rough stone and mortar, neatly white-washed on the mside, and the flat clay roots are supported by pillars made of fig trees. The walls of the apartments are u of small recesses like pigeon-holes, of every variety of shape, which are use for storing various small articles, and are at the same time ornamental 1 he floors are well made of stiff clay, with one or more basm-shaped^tiesm them, to be used as hearths. The houses are generally very large and are what may be called double; they often contain the whoie fami y from the great-grandfather down to the youngest descendant, with all their a ' The 'chief articles of food nsed by all classes of the people barley- bread onions, and figs or grapes, either fresh or dried, acc&lt;) ( ii g season ^wheaten bread is veiy rarely seen. , The bread is sl^ and baked in ovens shaped like large earthen jars, which are heate ^y b ' ino-in them a quantity of fig-leaves and twigs, dried grass or any other eom- bustible.

Like Jews and Mahamadans, they do not eat pork, but ey 333334 YEZ freely eat the blood of sheep, g-oats, cows, and other animals. Of vegeta bles they appear to have none but the pumpkin, which they eat stewed with meat. They are passionately fond of tobacco, to obtain which they will part with anything 1 . No kind of wine or spirituous liquor is drunk by them; their only beverage besides pure water being pomegranate sherbet and a sweet drink, made by infusing dried figs in boiling water. The men and women eat separately, the latter always in private. The character of the Yezdis is rather superior to that of their neighbours of Mesopotamia. They are brave, hospitable, and sober, faithful to their promise, and much attached to their native soil, but at the same time cruel and vindictive, considering their proper means of support to be robbery and theft; and they treat with great ferocity any unfortunate Mahamadans who fall into their power, especially Persians. They differ from the surrounding tribes in not being polygamists; they take only one wife, and generally marry at the age of sixteen or seventeen. All the different tribes of Kurdistan and Sinjar intermarry with each other. Mr. Ainsworth who visited the shrine of Shekh Adi, north of Mfisal, gives some information of this people :—'We now/' he says, ' asked the Yezdis present concerning the peacock, of which they at once declared their ignorance. The question was put to them publicly and so abruptly that no opportunity was given to prepare an evasive answer. I carefully watched the expression of their countenances and saw nothing that indicated deceit; on the contrary, the expression was that of surprise at the inquiry, and I am strongly inclined to think that the history of the Melik Tans or King Peacock, as related by Father Maurizio G-arzoni, M. Rousseau, BuckinghanT, and more modern travellers, as Mr. Forbes, is a calumny invented by the Christians of those countries. I venture this assertion, however, with reserve; for it is curious that a Christian residing 1 at Kathandiyah, in the neighbourhood of the place, still persisted in the truth of this tradition. The Mahamadan Kurds (not Yezdis), who served as muleteers, remarked to me that they had themselves found it to be a falsehood. The images of David and Solomon have no more existence than the peacock; and I need not add that the account of their assembling on the eve of the festival held on the tenth day of the moon, in the month of August, of the lights being extinguished, and of their holding promiscuous intercourse till morning, has every appearance of being a base calumny, assailing human nature in general, while aimed against the poor Yezdis in particular.' The proof of direct worship of the Spirit of Evil has been mainly founded upon the fact that no traces have been perceived of the worship of Yezdan, or Orrnuza, or the good principle, in opposition to Ahriman, or the evil principle. This is at the best but a negative argument. Whatever has been propagated among these people of the ancient doctrine of the Parsis must be now corrupted by gross superstitions; and we may, perhaps, recognise in the sculptured idol accompanying the serpent, the emblem of Fzed Ferfer, or other of the Parsi attendants upon the evil spirit. The name Fzed suggests a coincidence as curious as that remarked upon by Major Rawlinson from Theophanes, and a letter of Heraclius to the Senate, noticing a position in Adiabene, called Jesdem, and which he considers as a settlement of Pzedis, or, as they were afterwards named by the Maha madans, Yezidis. Major Rawlinson does not make any further remarks upon this sect; but it would appear from this passage that he regards themYEZ t , j. p n ^mrc nf TVod as su^grested al)ovc, rather than of Yczd, as I zcdis, or followers ot 1 , • 0 7 r -. u ave however, many super- the second o£ the Om.made { ' a ^ Cy ^ Jit may. the I 'Ul, st'tio'is y™' 1 '' 0 ,. exulted doctor (as the evil spirit is vanously Karuben, bhekii jViazti, , n eon verted by the ignorance of called) of the 1 zedis, is a ^ coiru l &gt; ^ &lt; i-. € J. t wors hip, by the same process the people alone into whatever 0 doctrine oJ the intercession o£ saints — 1 a ' d CTen ricture - 'K-eir speaks of the IWis » X in Sinjar.

The following particulars on the which 1 give without comment. shortness of our stay, my inform- subject of my inquiries, however, help to elucidate this obscure ation is necessarily incomplete , it may,336 YEZ relig-ious phenomenon. The term ' devil-worsluppers' is by no means cor rectly applied to the Yezidis. They asserted explicitly their belief in one God, the same who is worshiped by the Armenians, and added that they reg-arded Jesus as the Son of God, and venerated Mary, the mother of Jesus, with certain holy men, among-st the rest, Surb Kework (evidently St Georg-e, whom the Armenians also honour under the name of St. Mogni), sometimes going- on pilgrimage to the monastery of that saint in Armenia. ' They pray with their faces towards the east. In passing an Armenian Church they offer up a short prayer, but never enter. Their children receive a kind of baptism with water, but our host either did not know the forms used on the occasion, or would not reveal them. The priests have traditional, unwritten forms of prayer; many of them can write, but the common people can neither write nor read. They do not practise circumcision. The dead are buried with their arms crossed, whilst the Mahamadans extend them beside the body. Wine they regard as the blood of Christ, and therefore sacred; they always hold the cup with both hands to avoid spilling; if but a drop fall on the ground, they immediately suck it up with the mouth, swallowing the dust with which it has mingled. They marry but one wife; a mutual public declaration and a blessing from the priest form part of the marriage ceremony, which is conducted with solemnity. Oaths and vows are universally regarded by them as sacred. A singular custom, however, is observed : at a certain part of the marriage ceremony the bridegroom walks into running water, the bride on dry ground. My informant said that he long endeavoured in vain to discover the meaning of this practice; at length a Yezdi with whom he was intimate told him jocosely that if, while vowing fidelity to their wives, they stood in running water, it in some measure washed away the binding 1 nature of the oath, and transgression would not be so severely punished. ' The Yezidis practise a kind of confession and penance. A society is formed, consisting of ten adult men, who select one of their number to be a scapegoat. If one of them believes himself to have committed a grave sin he confesses it to the substitute who must expiate it by prayers, fasting, and mortification ; in return for this service, they work for him, pasture his cattle, and entirely maintain him. ' The Yezidis are monotheists and are ignorant of the doctrine of the Trinity. Of the Holy Spirit they know nothing; they designate Christ as the Son of God, but do not recognise his divinity. They believe that Satan (Sheitan) was the first-created, greatest, and most exalted of the Archangels; that the world was made by him at God's command, an that to him was entrusted its government; but that, for esteeming himself equal with God, he was banished from the Divine presence. Nevertheless he will be again received into favour, and his kingdom (this world) restored to him. They suffer no one to speak ill of Satan, if the Mahamadan curse, ' Lanat SheitSna \' (Accursed be Satan!) be uttered in their presence, they are bound to slay either the speaker or themselves. On a certain day they offer to Satan thirty sheep; at Easter they sacrifice to Christ but only a single sheep; Christ, they say, is merciful, and his favour easily procured, but Satan is not so readily propitiated. The sacrifice takes place usually in the open country, but sometimes near the Armenian churches; they are offered chiefly to Satan, sometimes to Christ and the Saints, i*arely or never directly to the Supreme Being. Satan is called Melik Taus (King Peacock.) The Yezldis have no special forms of prayer, but observe certain fasts.YEZ-YUS Thev ave extremely superstitious: if a circle is drawn around one of them with a stick, he dares not step out of it; he will utter loud cries, hut will remain on the spot for a week, unless the circle is erased by the person who drew it, and with the same stick. Great purity of morals is required in the priests. They are not permitted to wear linen or cotton, only hair-cloth ' The Yezidis whom we saw were well formed, large and muscular; fine arched eyebrows, black eyes, aquiline nose, and a rather broad countenance were noticeable in all. They are said to be generally very poor; these however possessed considerable wealth. Their costume is picturesque an somewhat resembles that o£ the Turks. We entered several tents, and fonnd the women weaving carpets, an art whxch they well understand. An inextinguishable national as well as religious enmity exists between the Yczidis and the Persians; the latter assert that the two grandsons of Ma- hamad HOsSn and Hasan, with his seventy great-grandsons, had been killed bv the Yezdis. Should a Yezdi venture alone into a Persian village, he would immediately be killed. The brave Yezdis, however, despise the cowardly and effeminate Persians. i • z.i • • i ' The following are the conclusions I came to respecting this singular wnr) i p . They are not a Mahamadan sect, for they despise Mahamad and his doctrines'; neither do they exhibit any trace of polytheism, llicir religion is not of Pavsi origin, for with them Satan is not, like Ahnman, a personitication of the evil principle; nor does it appear that any vestiges of the Jewish law or rites exist amongst them ; though it has been asstited Itthey hold m reverence the First Book of Moses. Still they are a relieious sect, and not a distinct race. They are probably of Kurdish descent and their religion is an obscured, disfigured Christianity, ihey were I imagine, originally a Gnostic sect, which in an early age separated Tr w^s expelled from the Christian Church. Their doctrine of Satan is evidently the Gnostic doctrine of the Demiurgns; the position they assign to Christ reminds us of Amman. (Forbes—Ammorth—Van Haxlkansen.) YEZD KHANEH SC—Lat. Long. Elev.

Elev. A river of Kurdistan, which is formed by several different streams running 1 through the Jawur Mountains and converging on the southern slope of the Great Kurdistan chain. The main branch has its sources at Koniyeh, Karasim, and Kashen ; all three of which places are on the slopes of the Sar-al-Bagh range, in about 38° 30' north latitude, and nearly midway between Lakes Van and Urumivah, The trunk formed by the junction of these streams has at Kanda Kilisa an elevation of 6,800 feet above the Black Sea, and is augmented by several smaller affluents as it winds in a southerly direction through the mountains. At 37° 19 north latitude it bends to the south-west along a fine valley, in which are many villages and delightful groves, with varied and abundant vegetation. After passing near the southern sideof the town and castle of JQlamerik, it flows onward, separating the high mountains on the northern, and the still loftier peaks of Jawur Tagh on the southern side. It is joined by the Berdizawi, or western branch, near the village of Kiyair in Warendun, in about 34° 5' north latitude, and 43° 26 east longitude, and the space between these two arms near their confluence is occupied by the huge mountain mass called Mekannah. The Berdizawi, which bears the local name of the Little Zab, is understood to spring from the slopes of Erdish Tagh, some miles southward of the eastern extremity of Lake Van, from whence it winds through limestone formations in the general direction of south-south-east to the point of junction. In the latter part of its course it is augmented by the Mar Hannan and several other streams. On both sides of the river the country is well cultivated, and contains numerous villages, which communicate with each other by means of bridges formed of twigs twisted together with much ingenuity. Soon after a large tributary from the north-east enters the Berdizawi near the village of Leihun, the river throws itself with a cloud of foam and spray over the succession of limestone terraces, which form at this place a great and striking waterfall; and a little lower it joins the eastern branch. After the junction of the two great arms, the Zab takes the direction of the western branch, that is, south of east, till at about 12 miles east by north of Amadia it sweeps round to the east, and soon afterwards receives a moderate-sized stream, which comes by an easterly course from beyond that town. From hence the general direction of the trunk is rather north of east along the great valley between the Tura Tobi and Zibar Mountains on the north, and those of Zibeiri on the south, as far as a point 10 miles westward of Rowandiz, where, being joined by a considerable tributary, it suddenly sweeps round to the west-south-west. This tributary which, up to the recent visit of Mr. Ainsworth, h:id been mistaken for the Great Zsb, is formed by numerous branches springing from the slopes of the Keli Shin and Kendilan Mountains; the principal of these branches, the Sidaka, receives the others a few miles north of Rowandiz, after flowing west-south-west through a limestone bed. The united waters winds soutli^ ward to that town, and from thence, on being joined by the Rowandiz339 ZAB River, flow west and west-north-west into the Zab; having- previously at about two miles and a half below this remarkable stronghold of the KOrds, received a river, which, flowing through deep ravines and secluded dells, comes into it from the limestone chain to the south-west, called Sar Hasan Beg. The main trunk now, under the appellation of the Great Zab, winds onward west-south-west through the valley and between the villages of Kendil and Kasroki; about miles below these places, in the same direc tion, it receives the Akra (a tributary from the north-west), and, on the opposite side, the Bastora Chai. The course of the river from hence is nearly south-west till it falls into the Tigris, short of which, about midway, it receives the River Khazir or Bumadus, a considerable affluent formed by the Ghomar Sa and other tributaries, all springing to the southward of Amadia. After this accession to its waters, the Zab continues in the previous direction till it enters the Tigris below Senn at Kushaf in latitude 35° 59' SO' 7 with a deep stream 60 feet wide, and it forms at this place divided into two branches by a pebbly island. The waters of the Zab are here a clear blue, those of the Tigris muddy, and the two streams are visible flowing separately long after the junction. Much allusion has been made to the comparative size of the Great Zab and of the Tigris at Musal, and this is not surprising, since they are so nearly equal in magnitude that sometimes the one has the superiority, sometimes the other. Anisworth collected a variety of data upon the subject, the result of which is that at Nimrud, at the ferry to Arbel, and at Herir, the Zab varies from 150 to 200 yards in width, while the Tigris, seldom less than 200 yards, expands occasionally to 300 and even 400 yards as at Yarumjah. But the Zab is always much deeper; and it is probably on this account that it is so celebrated for the quantity and size of its fish. It contained a larger body of water than the Tigris, whose tributaries are not supplied by so many snow-mountains as those of the Zab. Indeed the main branch, or that of Arghana M'aden, comes from mountains (Azarah), where there is no snow at this season of the year. The temperature of the waters of the Zab is also several degrees lower than that of the waters of the Tigris throughout summer, and they are consequently delicious to drink. The seasons of the floods of the Tigris are in April and May, and those of the Zdb in June and early in July, the superiority passes in succession from the one to the other. When at their lowest, probably, the Tigris has a slight pre-eminence. The Zab is fordable at the following places between the village of Eski Kellek and its mouth. 1. At Ssitteihh, an Arab village above Kushaf; a very bad ford, deep, the bottom large slippery stones. 2. At Shumeisat— Arabs—a bad ford; above Ssitteihh, nearer Eurdek. 3. A ford above Eurdek. 4. At Eski Kellek; the best ford of all. 5. At New Kellek. There are three fords above New Kellek, between it and the mountain. None of these fords are now passable : they disappear at the firt rains. [Rawlinson— Rich—Jones—Ainsworth—Chesney.) ZAB (LESSER)—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Turkish Kurdistan, the principal source of which is in the Legwin Valley, from hence it flows down into the Lahijan plain, where it is joined by a multitude of little streams from the Kandil Mountains and then passing along Sardasht, it forces its way through the great chain and descends into the plains of Assyria, and this course is not little singular, for the features340 ZAB—ZER of the country would lead one to believe that the waters of Lahijan, on the north-east face of the great mountains, must necessarily flow into Persia as Colonel Monteith has laid down in his map, the contrary however is undoubt edly the case. The Lahijan River, even at its very source, is named the Zei, the usual pronunciation of Zab among the Kurds, and Ravvlinson took some pains to identify it with the AltUn Sn, or Lesser Zab. At Altun Kopri the Lesser Zab is shallow in August, but at other seasons it is deep, and about 50 yards wide before it divides. The Lesser Zab is also formed of the drainage from the mountains north of Sulimania, and west of Sehnah. (Rawlinson.) ZAB A.—Lat. Long. Elev. See Ali Kathir. ZAGROS.—Lat. Long. Elev.

It is said that the waters of the Zangai have a tendency to petrification. They are decidedly heavy and very unwholesome for drinking. It washes the walls of Erivan, its sides being a perpendicular rocky bank of 30 feet high. It is fordable with extreme difficulty at Erivan on account of the rocky bed and rapid current.

It is con sidered a powerful tribe, being able to raise 500 horse and 600 foot armed with fire-arms. They are of Sflni principles: generally support the Government, but are much demoralized of late from intercourse with the town. Their war-cry is ' Jeheysh,' and their Chiefs are from the house of Abdala, an ancestor of great repute, who derived his pedigree direct from the Himyar (Homeritoe of Ptolemy), a very early and renowned ra3eof Arabs in Yemen. Wadi ibn Sheffclleh, the hereditary Chief, styles himself of the house of Abdala. Those boasting of immediate descent from this house now comprise about 40 tents; and the whole tribe, when required to make an oath of more than ordinary solemnity, regard swearing by the ' head of Abdala,' as the most binding on their conscience, for it admits of no mental reservation. Indeed, the infringement of this oath, or taking it342 ZOB—ZUG without full intention of keeping- it, was formerly considered punishable with death; but demoralisation is undermining 1 the old statutes of all the tribes. [Jones.) ZOBER.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, 10 miles west of Basra, on the dry canal of the Sarreh Zadeh. It is a picturesque old Arab town surrounded by a mud wall with grand towers and numerous minarets. The modern town is built on the ruins of old Basra, which occupy an enormous space and extend to the extremity of the gravel deposits that terminate in the marsh of the Shatt-al-Arab.' It contains 3,000 inhabitants who are Arabs of a mongrel breed, and are princpally engaged in supplying carriage for the wants of Basra. Five minutes walk south-east of the town is a large spring of good water flowing out of the ground in sufficient quantity to supply 10,000 men. [Kinnier—Toff us—Colvile.) ZODI.—Lat. Long. Elev.

During the three severest months of the winter, owing to the intense cold and to the depth of the snow, it is impassable. It is a favourite cold-weather resort of the Kurds and other wanderers, who in the summer season are to be seen in every part of it, living in black tents and having numerous flocks of sheep and goats. The difference of temperature between the slopes of tins mountain and the valley of the Ashtarak River below is considerable, having when Morier visited it amounted to no less than 18°. {Morier.) ABA RAN—Lat. Long. ^Elev. A small town in Russian Armenia, on the south slope of the Alagaz Mountains, 30 miles north-west of Erivan. It lies near the left bank of a considerable stream of the same name which rises in the Alagaz Mountains and flows towards the Aras. The valley of the Abaran was the scene of the last gallant struggle of Colonel Montresor of the Russian army, who was here over taken by Pir Kuli Khan with 6,000 horse in the attempt to open commu nication between hrivan and Kara Killsia and after a desperate struggle slain with nearly all the Russians with him. Lumsden says Abaran is ' nothing but a fine ruin of an Armenian Church in the midst of half-buried fragments of houses.' [Imperial Gazetteer—Lumsden—Monteith.) ABASIA—Lat. Long. Elev. A trans-Caucasian Province, in the Government of Immeretia, Russia, bounded north and west by the Caucasus, which separates it from Circassia, east by Mingrelia and south by the Black Sea. The country consists of the southern slopes of the Caucasus and of the low plains intervening between these mountains and the Sea. The prevailing geological formations are greenstone, porphyry, and black slate, and limestone. Immense forests of the finest trees, oak, alder, chesnut, &amp;c., clothe the mountain sides stretching down to the plains, whose Italian climate, ripening maize, figs, pomegranates, the fruits of Central Europe, grain, and excellent grapes,' invites profitable cultivation, but the country is a waste, its numerous ruins alone proclaiming its former flourishing condition. Nor do the Abases excel in cattle rearing, agriculture, or commerce; a little of the latter, in felt mantles, in fox and polecat skins, honey, wax, and box-wood, being carried on. On the contrary with such indif ference are these branches of industry pursued that by their means they do not obtain a sufficient subsistence, which therefore they eke out in the manner most congenial to their tastes by plunder and robbery, occupa tions which in them have become a second nature. The slave trade withABA—ABE Turkey formerly constituted one of the chief employments, and tended greatly to reduce the population. Notwithstanding the watehfulncss of the Kussians slaves are still secretly exported. The Abases belong to the Circas- sian lace and distinguish among themselves five tribes—Abases Proper, 1 -t Ol iTf Isc ^ d ' cl&lt;llcs ; Ab ^ h -; w « s . Imnozahanes. The Abasians number some lat, families, mostly Mahamadans. Tliey call themselves in their own language Apsna and the territory along the coast Apsne. They are classed into princes, noblemen, and peasants. The peasants have been called since the sway of the Georgians Thawadi; the noblemen, Amystha. The popu- lation is extremely rude and miserable, living in thatched wicker huts, which afford Imt slight protection against the weather. , Under the Byzantine Emperors Abasia formed an independent State separate from Georgia In the and V Tn I7T7 7 ' ^ ^ ^ ^ o£ u '^ -homlt decayed and 1„ 17.)/ it came under the supremacy of the Turks.

A river of Kurdistan, which rises in the mountains of Mangasht near Kalat Ala, from which it receives its name. Leaving 1 the high range it traverses the small and fertile valley of Mai Daud. Below the plain of Bagh-i-Malik it receives the waters of the Ab i Zard, and then empties itself into the Ab-i- Ramoz, a feeder of the Jarahi. The water of this river is of the most exqui site transparency, and is celebrated for its purity throughout the country. On its banks are the ruins of many villages and towns of the Sassanian period. The houses which are almost without exception vaulted are con structed of roughly hewn stone united by a very tenacious cement. {Layard.) ABICHES.—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of the Caucasus, who inhabit the mountains on the east coast of the Black Sea. They are said to excel all the tribes in daring and bravery, but they are rapacious, revengeful, treacherous, and cruel to their prisoners. Only two Europeans have acquired any information of this people, one the Englishman Bell, the other a Baron Von Turnau, who was taken prisoner by them. The latter describes their country as one mass of steep mountains pre senting the wildest features of the Caucasian region. Immense primeval forests clothe slopes of the mountains on the side of the Black Sea. The villages are generally placed in most inaccessible spots being either hidden in the bosom of the thickest forest or perched like eagles' nests on the rocky declivities at the edge of the chasms.— { Wagner.) AB-I-GARM.—Lat. Long. Elev. A hot spring in the Province of Kars, Asiatic Turkey, to which considerable medicinal qualities are attributed. It lies on the road from Kars to Arzrum, about 60 miles west of the former, and on the boundary between the two provinces. Travellers are in the habit of bathing in it, though Sir W. Ouseley describes the heat to be ' almost as great as the human body can well endure.' {Ouseley AB-I-RBSH.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kurdistan, which rises in the southern slopes of the Jabl Turand on the junction of the Ab-i-Spi forms the Jaghjagha River. It has its rise in a deep sluggish pool near some old grots. The water of this river is as its name Resh denotes of a darker colour than that of the Ab-i-Spi. {Tayler.) AB-I-SPI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of KurdistSn which rises in the south slopes of the Jabl Tnr and on the junction of the Ab-i-Resh forms the Jaghjagha River. It rises in a deep spring at the base of the mountains and its water is clear and sparkling as crystal. {Taylor.)ADE—ABJ Adeljiwaz contains about 250 Mahamadan and 30 Armenian families. There is an old castle in ruins, placed high on a rock above the town, which is enclosed by walls uniting with the works of the castle at both extremities, and running directly down to the lake. There is no defence on that side of the town, but the water is too deep to admit of persons getting round the end of the walls which terminate in the lake, and are in a tolerable state of repair, and the gates serve to keep intruders out. {Brant—Glascott.) AD HEM—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the moun tains of Karkuk, and after a south course for some distance it receives the Tauk, a tributary coming from the north-east, and a little lower the TtJz-Khurmati, coming by a westerly direction from the Karadagh range. The course of the Adhem continues to run south through the Hamrin hills, at the foot of which on the south side are the remains of a remarkable ' bund,' which was constructed with the most solid materials at a remote period. Its object was to raise the water so as to supply the canal of Rathan which runs to the south-south-east as well as that of the Nahr Bat. This 'bund' is built of enormously large blocks of hewn sandstone cemented with lime, and is in the form of two sides of a square, one crossing the stream just where it leaves the Hamrin hills, the other running along the right bank. Though of vast strength and thickness it has not been sufficient to resist the force of the water and has given way in its centre right down to its foundations. At the ' bund ' the river is not above 30 feet broad, and in summer only from 12 to 20 inches deep, but in winter the rush of water is said to be terrific, carrying away all before it. The Adhem carries into the Tigris the united waters of the Krosa Su, Tauk SQ, andTuz Khurmati Su. At its confluence it is but 15 yards wide and 20 inches deep, and for from three to five months of the year it is nearly dry. [Ross—Jones—li 'tch.) ADIAN KURDS—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Kurds who inhabit the country near Khoskheyr on the banks of the Bohtan Su, in the Bohtan Berwari district. They claim to be the descendants of the real Shekh Adi, the Saint of the Kurds. (Taylor.) AD1NA KEWY—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, 3^ miles from the caravanserai of Delli Abbas, and a little off the main road to Sulimania.

It is nearly circularly disposed round a mound called Castle Hill, is sur rounded by gardens, and contains 800 houses of Musalmans and 300 of Christians. It has several mosques, three ruinous ' Khans/ and one bath. On an adjacent hill are the tombs of two celebrated men. {Ainsworth—Im- perial Gazetteer^ ADJARA St)—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Turkey in Asia in the province of Trebizond, rising in the moun tains to the east of Batum and flowing with a direction generally west past the towns of Kulah, Kizl Kalesi, and Maghal falls into the Jorak Su at the last mentioned place after a course of about 50 miles.

At its east end are the remains of a fine old castle with a double wall, communicating by a covered stair of 177 steps, cut out of the rock, with the Tigris. At the west end the mass on which the fort is built has been artificially separated from the parent mountain so as to secure complete isolation. A ravine runs round the south side of the mountain, the river being' on the north. [Taylor.) AHMAD1A—Lat. Long 1 . Elev.

The lake is formed by the waters coming from the Euphrates by the Saklawiah canal. It has a length of about 12 miles, a breadth of five, with a depth in the centre of from 12 to 15 feet. It is navigable for steamers, the Euphrates of Colonel Chesney's Expedition having passed through it in 1838. [Chesney.) AKAVANSK—Lat. Long. Elev.

Though possessed of but little strength, it is a place of very great importance from its situation, as it commands the bndgc over this branch of the Kur. The castle is 300 yards ong, )0 or SO broad, and stands at the angle formed by the iunction of two sma I streams, the Taparwan and Gen Dara Su, which, like all the streams in this elevated region, flow through deep ravines with high cliffs. It was at one time a considerable place, with an extensive suburb, containing a mosque and about 600 houses, but for many years before its capture by the Russians had become merely a resort of banditti and slave-dealers. The defences consisted ot loop-holed walls and towers divided into two stories : there wf a co ^ rc ' d Passage to the river to enable the garrison to supply them selves with water, but the place is commanded by hills on both sides The Russian General Goudowitz was repulsed with great loss in 1807 in an attempt to storm it, but it was afterwards taken by surprise by General Kutlorousky ami the garrison put to the sword to a man.

The Russian 'Sanjaks' o£ Akhitskhai, Atskhva, Asspinz, Khertvisse, and Akhalkalaki, with the fortress of the latter, contain 103 villages, in which there are 11,8U0 Armenians in addition to 7,200 persons, consisting of Kurds, Jews, Boche Gipsies, Tartars, and Karapapaks. A certain number of Armenians profess the Catholic religion, the rest the Armenian. The other inhabitants, including the greater part of the Georgians, are Mahamadans, and the language is spoken in all its purity. Akhiska was once a district or province of Georgia, but was formed into an Ata 13t'luk at an eaily period of the Mahamadan power, and the greater part of the inhabi tants forced to embrace the faith of Islam. It became Russian territory at the peace of 1829. Akhiska used to be the resort of all the robbers and banditti of the surrounding country, who here found a secure asylum and favourable field for carrying on their system ot plunder, and the inhabitants had earned a reputation as the bravest and most des perate in Asia, and were greatly prized by the Turks as soldiers as forming the most determined garrison in fortified places. Ihe winters of this dis trict are long and rigorous, but the climate is generally healthy, the air pure, and the soil fertile, but the sudden changes of the seasons are unfa vourable to cultivation ; maize, barley, tobacco, flax, and cotton are among the ordinary produce, while excellent fruits grow without much culture. Ihe inhabitants raise cattle and sheep in considerable numbers, particularly the latter, and pay great attention to the breeding of bees and silk-worms. The population is estimated at 70,000 Georgians, Turks, Armenians, Jews. (Ch esney—I taper ia I Gazetteer.) AKHISKA.—Lat. 41° 35' Long. 42° 44/ Elev. A town in district of same name in Georgia, on the left bank oi the Dalka, 10 miles above its junction with the Kur, 110 miles north-west of iillis, 12.) miles north-east of Arzrum. It is an open town, divided into three parts by ravines, with high rocky precipices, and defended by a citadel with stone walls. It is the seat of a Greek Archbishop, and contains two C hiistian Churches (one Roman Catholic, a handsome building, with a dome o\e^ the centre), a Jewish synagogue and several mosques, one of which, that of Sultan Ahmad, is built on the model of St. Sophia at Constantinople, and has a college and library attached to it. The latter was accounted one of the most curious in the east, but the Russians have removed about '300 ol the most valuable works to St. Petersburgh. The neighbourhood of the town produces silk, honey, and wax, with excellent fruits ; raisins, peaches, apricots, and ligs. Some manufactures are carried on, and the inhabitants prosecute an aetive trade with various places on the Black Sea. Formerly a large slave-market was held here, but it has been suppressed by the Russians since theyacquned possession of the town. In the vicinity are some alkaline springs. Ihe popula tion in 1850 was 12,060, though Von Haxthausen says 10,000, including Armenians, Georgians, Turks, Russians, and Jews. Alkhalzik was a point of the greatest importance to the Turks. Established here they ruled and plun dered all the districts south of the West Caucasus, and issuing from hem e their emissaries sustained the warlike spirit of the Circassians and Lesghis. Rallying under the standard of the Pasha of Akhalzik the Lesghis robbed and devastated the rich country of Georgia. The Ossetians, Didos, and Djaie* overran the beautiful banks and valleys of the Kvir and Alasan. Kidnapped11 AK—AKU AK KALA SU—Lat. Long-, Elcv.

A stronghold in the Lesghi country in Caucasia, situated at the junction of the Andishkoisu and the Avarsh Korsu Rivers, some 50 miles west by south of Tarki. It was the scene of a sanguinary conflict in 1839 between the Russians under General Grabb and the Tchetcheus under the celebrated13 ALA—ALB Ararat, and on the same range. Its height has not been accurately ascer tained but is stated at 9 to 10,000 feet On the north face of the highest peaks Brant saw large masses of snow lying in September. The range from Mount Ararat west to near the junction of the two main sources of the Euphrates seems to have this name. {Brant—Stuart.) AL ATHAR.—Lat. Long. Elev.

A river of Georgia, which is a large tributary of the Kur, rises in the slopes of the Caucasus, and flowing with a course nearly south-east or almost parallel to the Knr falls into that river immediately after its junction with the Yora, after a course of 250 miles. It is crossed by the road from Tiflis to Baku. The valley of the Alazan is one of the richest parts of Georgia. Its plains are highly cultivated and productive and the surrounding hills are covered with valuable forests of pine, chestnut, oak, ash, and other timber. [Chesney.) AL-BAKR.—Lat. Long. Elev.

It occupies eight small I ilk of TP- 0 ^ P astura g&lt; ! f'-- 1415 ALE which there are seven gates. Its circumference within the walls is about 3i miles, without and including the suburbs, about seven miles. Its appearance, on approaching it, is striking and picturesque. Numerous mosques, cupolas, and minarets, the last of dazzling whiteness, crowd on the eye; the flat roofs of the houses on the hills rise one behind another in a succession of hang ing terraces, while a profusion of cypress and poplar trees impart beauty and animation to the whole. But on entering the gates much of this pleasing illusion is dispelled. The streets are found to be gloomy and silent; the shops mean-looking; and the baths and fountains heavy, unadorned structures. The houses, however, are well and substantially built of stone, two or three stories in height; mostly in the Saracenic style, with spacious apartments, large windows, and richly ornamented walls and ceilings, the latter being often beautifully painted and gilded. In some quarters of the city, particularly in that called Djedeide, the streets are well paved, and in general better kept than those of any other town in Syria. An ample supply of water is brought into the city by an ancient aqueduct, from two springs eight miles distant. On an oval hill, in the north-east corner of the city, stands the castle of Aleppo, a conspicuous object, surrounded by a broad and deep fosse, half mile in circumference, now filled up with gardens and plantations. A large square tower, beautifully inlaid with a dark coloured stone, forms the entrance, but the interior is in mins, two houses only being now habitable. The only other public buildings of any interest are the ancient seraglio, or place of the Pasha, and the mosque of Djami-el- Adelieh. The former, now also in ruins, was of great extent and magnifi cence, but the only portion of its splendours now remaining is a gateway of admirable workmanship, the arch of which is composed of blocks of polished white and black marble. The seraglio was destroyed in 1819-20 during the siege of the city by Kourchid Ahmed Pasha. The mosque of l)jami-el-Adelieh is reckoned one of the most graceful structures of the kind in Syria; it is surmounted by a magnificent dome, and by a tall and elegant minaret. A spiral staircase conducts to the top of the latter, from which a splendid view of the city and surrounding country is obtained. The beautiful portico of the mosque was much injured by the earthquake of 1822. There are two libraries in the city, one attached to the Osmanieh mosque, the other to a college called the Ahmedieh; the latter, though suffi ciently meagre, is reckoned the best in Syria. Such institutions, however, meet with little encouragement in Aleppo, the taste for literature being extremely limited; neither is education in a better condition. Pre vious to the earthquake of 1822, Aleppo carried on a considerable trade with England, importing thence large quantities of red cloth, &amp;c., and re- exporting the Indian manufactures brought overland from Baghdad. Its manufactures were then also very valuable, consisting of shawls, cottons, silks, gold, and silver lace, &amp;c., in which, it is said, 12,000 artizans were en gaged. But, on the occasion of the calamity alluded to, the town was nearly deserted by its surviving inhabitants, and its trade ruined. Both the latter and former, however, have considerably improved since; and Aleppo still retains, or has regained, its ancient reputation for the excellence of its silk stuffs, with gold and silver thread, and its flowered and striped cottons, in the manufacture of which about 4,000 looms, and nearly 5,000 persons, adults and children, are employed. There are besides numerous soap, dyeing,ALE mui print works. Its trade with Eng-land has also revived, 5,000 bales ot J3 ritish manufactures being yearly imported, while its caravan trade with 1I J terior 1S . likewise rapidly improving, the merchants finding- thev can now be supplied in Aleppo with all they want. Considerable quantities of wool and silk are exported to France and Italy ; of the former, 2,508 bales were exported in one year lately, and 179 of the latter. The retail or f l(&gt;P . ra( t ^ however, does not seem to be very vigorous, owing in part per- wZl. r I'T I T 1 ''- em,&gt;,0 - vcd i ' it ' the negate amount of ich, according to Doctor Bownng, does not exceed £20,000 sterling. The celebrated gardens of Aleppo, nearly 12 miles in length, are situated to h.v.f ff r f C r 7 ' though much prized by the natives they havo tew attractions for Europeans, being sub-divided and enclosed by low stone walls and exhibiting little of either taste or skill in management or c langement.

The soil is generally fertile and suited to the culture of grain and vines. The Ival- maks establish their winter quarters on the north and south; numerous bands of Nogays pasture their flocks in the valleys of the south. AL FEDAGHA—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs who wander about near Nahr Mahmudieh, west of Bagh dad, Asiatic Turkey. They number 150 tents and the same number of matchlocks. They are pastoral, agricultural, and warlike, and possess some good horses. [Jones.) AL HADR—Lat. 35 0 47' Long. 42 0 35 / Elev. A ruined ancient city on the banks of the Tharthar river in province of Bagh dad, Asiatic Turkey, 190 miles north-west of Baghdad, 40 miles south-west by south of Masai. The ruins occupy upwards of one mile in diameter and are enclosed by a circular wall of immense thickness, with square bastions or towers at every 60 paces, built of large square stone. Outside is a broad and very deep ditch now dry, and 100 to 150 paces beyond is a thick rampart, now only a few feet high. Going round the town, and at some distance from the fortifications, stand two high mounds, with square towers on them, one on the east side, and the other on the north. The whole city is built of a brownish-grey limestone. An interesting account of these ruins is to be found in 11th Vol. of the Roy. Geo. Society's Journal. [Ainsworth.) ALI ARCS—Lat. ' Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs dependent on Hawizeh district in Kurdistan. During the summer and autumn they inhabit the banks of the Kerkhah and the marshes, in the winter they travel into the desert on both sides of the river, where at those seasons they find pasturage for their cattle and flocks. [Layard.) ALI DELtT—Lat. Long. Elev. A village on Kurdistan in the Karadagh district at the source of the luz- khormati river— (Rich.) ALIGUR—Lat. Lon&lt; Elev.

Long. Elev. A village in the province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, six miles west of ArzrQm at the point where the Trebizond and Constantinople roads meet, situated on the west branch of the Euphrates. It is famous for baths and mineral springs which taste strongly of sulphur: their temperature is 85° to 100.° A Russian division quartered here in 1829 burnt down half the houses, which have not been rebuilt. The baths here are much frequented during the fine season by the inhabitants of Arzrum and its environs. [Stuart.) ALI KATHIR—Lat. Long. Elev. A large Arab tribe which occupies the district of Dizful, province of Khtizis- tan, Persia, the plain between the river of Dizful and the Karun, the countiy between the ShSwar and Dizfiil and the left bank of the Kerkhah with the plains of Shush. It is divided into the following branches:— Beni Moalla. Beni Maamah. Moawiyeh. Ali Lowweh. El Muaneh. Zeheriyah.19 ALK—ALT ALKOSII—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Mnsal, Asiatic Turkey, situated 80 miles north of Musal. It is a large place, very strongly built on the side of a low rocky hill; it is surrounded by a strong stone wall, and the houses are built in the most substantial manner of the same materials; all are arched at the lower story and being built on a declivity, they rise above each other, which together with all the houses being loopholed and very strong makes it a place of great strength. The inhabitants are all Chaldeans and Roman Catholics, speaking nothing but Arabic. They are said to number about 2,000 to 3,000 souls. They are a very stout independent set, and can muster about 400 matchlocks. The men dress like Kurds of the poorer class : the women wear blue trousers and over them a large blue shift; they wear no veils; their hair hangs down behind in two plaits or tails and round their heads they have a garland of silver coins. {Shiel.) (Rich.) AL-MASHAHEDEH—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs who wander about from Taji to Tarmigeh to the north-west of Baghdad above the Saklawieh canal and on the right bank of the Tigris. They number about 350 tents and the same number of matchlocks. They cultivate lands usually pertaining to the farmed district of Dijel. They have cattle in plenty, a few horses, and are capable of maintaining a position in a country exposed to the Bedouins. They are expert thieves and indulge their pro pensities in petty ways unusual with the Arabs in general. {Jones.) AL MUKADAM—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Chab Arabs who reside at Khut, near Dorak, in the Province of Khuzistan, Persia. They number 4,500 adult males. (Pelly.) AL-TAI—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs who reside south of the great Zab River in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey. They number 500 tents and are generally employed in cultivation, though at times predatory. They possess many camels. {Jones.) ALTYN KOPRI—Lat. Long. Elev. A town on the Altyn Su, Province of MtJsal, Asiatic Turkey, and 106 miles south-east from that town. It is situated in a peninsula (which becomes an island during the flood season) of the river, which is crossed by a bridge, whence the town received its name,' gold bridge/' Its population is said at one time to have been 8,000, but Kinneir says it is of the same size as Kufri, which has a population of 2,000 only. It contains in addition to the dwelling- houses several grain-stores and wharfs, at which last the rafts descending thus far are discharged. These are a little below the town in the right bank. The river just above the town is about a mile broad, but runs off into two arms, which join below, both equally considerable and leaving the town in an island. Many houses are commonly carried away in the spring. The town is then completely washed by the river. On the side of the great bridge the river is confined by a strong bank of concrete pebbles till about the height of the bridge, where the bank retreats about quarter of a mile and slopes up gently. On the north side is a low plain, sandy, and pebbly, confined by broken hills at about the distance of a mile. This space has evidently at times been filled by the river up to the hills. {Kinneir—Chesney Rich—Shiel.) ALTYN StT—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kurdistan, which rises near Ushnal to the south-west of the20 ALT—AMA north extremity of tlie Urumia Lake; then after a course of about 30 miles to the south-east it turns abruptly south-west, and about 20 miles onwards it receives in the latter direction five different affluents from the valleys of the Kurdistan Mountains. Thence it continues to Altyn Koprlj where it receives a stream from Koi Sanjak, whence it goes to join the Tigris. {Rich—Chesney—Shiel.) ALTYN TAKHT—Lat. * Long. Elev. An ancient ruined city in Shirvan, Russia, 11 miles from the ford of Yedi Baluk on the Aras. It is a considerable city which has every appearance of having a much greater antiquity than the name appears to warrant. The works are of the most solid construction and the bricks much larger than are observed in modern buildings. The fortress is 11 miles in circum ference, but there appears to have been an outer town, a suburb. A canal had formerly conducted waters of the Aras to irrigate the surrounding country, but it has long since been dry, and this city was finally ruined by Nadar Shah. AL OZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A village on the south bank of the Euphrates about 20 hours below Anah. It has 150 houses. {Kinneir.) ALW A R—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of ArzrQm, Asiatic Turkey, 5 miles from Hasn Kal, on the road to Arzrum. It is an extensive village, comprising besides many cavern houses, three or four large and handsome edifices. (Ouseley.) AMADIA—Lat. 36 0 37'. Long. Elev. 4,265. A town in Kurdistan, Asiatic Turkey, 75 miles north-north-east of Musal. It is built on a rock terrace of limestone, the only one which overlies the sand stone throughout the valley. This rock lies on the east side of the valley and is an offset from the Matineh range. The extent of the terrace, which is in shape somewhat oval, is three-fourths mile in length, and varying from 40 to 80 feet in altitude, consisting of compact limestone reposing upon limestone. It takes 45 minutes to ascend from the base to the gate, the road being tortuous. There are two gates to the town, one to the north-west, and the other to the east The town stands on the east portion of the terrace, the remainder being occupied by graves and a square open castle with circular towers at the angles, built by the late Beg of Rovandiz, when he sacked this place. The rock terrace is also defended at various points by guard-houses, towers, and irregularly constructed bastions, with occasional curtains, which are, however, not carried round the work. The town is all in ruins; of the houses formerly existing, only about one-fourth is made use of, the remainder being in a state of decay. Above these perishing materials there rises a ' serai,' the residence of the Pasha, the lower part built of stone, the upper of mud, and near it is a beautiful model of a pillar, a detached minaret, the only one in the place and also near the only existing mosque. At present the chief population of Amadia are Jews, who have 70 houses here and three synagogues. The Mahamadans have 60 houses and the Chaldeans have 20 houses, of which five are Roman Catholic. There are five houses of Armenians, who pursue their usual avocations as jewellers, armourers, &amp;c. There is usually a garrison of nearly 200 irregulars, chiefly Arnauts and Greeks of Rumelia. The valley of Amadia, although containing many villages belonging partly to Kurds of the Bahdinan tribe and partly to Chaldeans, is but sparingly cultivated, being mostly occupied by forests of Valonia oak, which more21 ama especially stretch along* the east fort of the Turag'harah from hence to Rowandiz, a distance of three days' journey, and this is the ^reat district for gathering galls and valonia. the bottom of the valley is occupied by a deposit of supra-cretaceous sandstone and sandstone conglomerate of little adhesion and deeply intersected by water-courses. It extends from the Ti gris to the vale of Rowandiz, being, however, curved about 12 miles east of Amadia, in the district of Zibeiri, and is about five or six miles in width. Amadia is the capital of the Bahdinan Kurds, and is called by the natives Lkbadan. i ,hc an of Amadia is hot and unwholesome in the summer in consequence of which all the inhabitants move at this season to an elevated situation, 2^ hours from the town, where there is snow all the summer. Here the Pasha has lus summei-house and people make huts for themselves. A strong guard is, however, obliged to be kept up here for fear of the Tiari tribe of Chaldeans, who are much dreaded by the Mahamadans. (Ainsworth Rich.) AMANA—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruined castle in the province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, situated at the angle formed by the junction of the Arganeh Maden and Dibeneh-Su, which form the west Tigris, and occupying the top of an isolated mountain, of great height and inaccessibility. It can be approached only on one side by a single path, hardly practicable for mules, the other two sides beim- hio-h perpendicular rocks, washed respectively by the Dibeneh and Maden nvers the weakest portion deriving additional strength from walls of amazin^ thickness. The area of the summit is about 1 ^ miles long and one mile broad, and the whole, with the exception of a small portion of the south end is choked by the debris of old houses and reservoirs of black stone. On the north-east side of the mountain a covered stair, cut out of the solid rock as at Eggil, 280 feet high and eight feet broad, leads down to the Dibeneh-Sn. Its site, its impregnability and extensive remains seem to coincide with that of the ancient Carcathescerta. AM ARE H— A tribe of Arabs who reside in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey.

A town in the province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on right bank of Euphrates, 160 miles west-north-west of Baghdad situated on a fringe of soil between a low ridge of rock and the river. The site of the ancient city of Anatti is upon the opposite bank, a little below the present town. Situated in a 2223 ANA—AMI district fertile in rice, corn, fruit, wine, and cotton, Anah forms a convenient resting place for the caravans which traverse the great desert of Meso potamia. It is, however, exposed to the desert winds, locally termed ' fatal whirlwind/ which blow with great violence. During the Euphrates expe dition, in 1836-37, the Ship Tigris was lost in one of these hurricanes. In 1807, Anah was sacked and burned by the Wahabis. The population, chiefly a branch of the Ommiades, or Beni-Ommaiyah, is estimated at 3,000 or 4,000. [Chesney—Rich—Imperial Gazetteer?) ANAKLIA.—Lat. 42 0 2Z' Long. Elev.

ANANUR.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Georgia, on right bank of the Aragua river and about 40 miles north of Tiflis. It contains 47 houses with a population of 150 Georgians and 100 Armenians. ANAPA.—Lat. 44 0 54' Long. 37 0 5 , Elev. A seaport and fortified town in Black Sea, Russian Circassia. The port is tolerably good for small vessels, but the outer road is unsheltered and is safely accessible only in the fine season. The fort was constructed in 1784 by the Turks when the Russians took possession of the Crimea and the island of Taman. In 1791 the Russians carried it by storm. It was after wards restored to the Turks, who strengthened the fortifications. By a sub sequent treaty the Russians again acquired possession of it. The ex ports are grain, tallow, hides, and honey and wax. The inhabitants are Cir cassians, Tartars, Greeks, Turks, Jews, Armenians, and Russians, and the popu lation, exclusive of the garrison, about 3,000. It is a poor place and wretchedly built, the only traces of European comfort being the newly-erected houses of the Russian Civil and Military officers. There used to be some Circassians in the garrison of this place. Before the acquisition of this place by the* Russians it used to be one of the chief posts by which the Turks used to supply the Circassians with arms, ammunition, and stores, to enable them to carry on the struggle with the former nation.

A village in Kurdistan high up in the mountains near the source of a tri butary of the Tigris, some 40 miles north of Nisibin and 12 miles south of Mediat. {Taylor.) ANI.—Lat. Long. Elev. An ancient city in Turkish Armenia, on the right bank of the Arpa Chai and 26 miles east of Kars. The city is situated on a tongue of land, protected on the east and south by the enormous and exceedingly steep ravine through which flows the Arpa Chai, and on the west by another ravine of similar proportions, which joins the above stream. These ravines may be 40 yards wide and 20 yards deep. The north is the only side exposed to assault, and this is defended by a double wall of hewn stone : even the ravines have been strengthened by a strong parapet, which runs the whole length of the face towards the Arpa Chai, and the ravine to the west. The space inside the walls must have been very confined and could not have admitted of a large population. Each face of the fortress is about 500 yards in length. The'rnnniiTiinigi ANI—ANT walls are in as perfect a state as if they hacl been recently erected, being 1 built-double, of a soft red stone, in the best style of architecture, and of great height and thickness, with enormous towers at close intervals. These are round and may be 60 feet in height. The entire structure, both walls and towers, is in such excellent preservation that comparatively little repair or expense would be required to make them serviceable. The gates of the two walls are not built opposite each other with the object no doubt of exposing an assaulting party to greater loss in proceeding from the outer to the inner gate. The site seems to have been admirably chosen for strength and pur poses of defence; at the south extremity is a high mound which was the citadel, crowned with extensive ruins. A bridge over the Arpa Chai, of which the remains are still in existence, connected the citadel with its left bank. Near this spot in the stream is a very rugged rock, on which is built called Kiz Kilisia. Besides the citadel the ruins consist of an edifice of great size on the north-west angle. There also two high columns shaped like minarets, but of great size, which may have been towers for military purposes. Three churches complete the remains of Ani. All these buildings, walls, citadel, palace, columns, and churches are made of the same beautiful reddish stone, intermixed with black, which receives a fine polish and produces an admirable effect. Everything is constructed in the most substantial and massive manner and of first-rate masonry. The sides of the immense ravine on the west side of the town are covered with excavations which form small apartments and which were evidently used as dwellings or as shops. At present there are no inhabitants whatever in this city, but it might doubtless be converted into an offensive and defensive position for Turkey in the same way as Gumri is for Russia, for the position is excellent, and with so many appliances at hand, the expense of converting this abandoned city into a fortification of great strength ought not to be heavy. AN J EL CHAI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Van, in Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the mountains to the south of the Mahmudieh Kala. It flows through a narrow valley and the channel is not in general more than 15 to 20 yards broad; but it is deep, being scarcely fordable. It flows into the Lake of Van, at the Bay of Vastan, and its depo sitions at this point has formed a sand bank, which extends to a considerable distance, and it is probable the way will before long be completely filled up as it is already very shallow.

Elev. The name applied by different authorities to various spurs from the range of the Caucasus in Asiatic Turkey. For instance the following 1 spurs are called Anti Taurus, viz., 1st., the spur between the two branches of the Euphrates; 2nd, that between the Murad Chai and the sources of the Tigris; 3rd, various spurs to the west of the Euphrates. This seems to me a very slipshod way of naming ranges, and it would certainly be better to leave it alone than give half a dozen totally different spurs the same name. The name Anti-Taurus is fanciful and of course unknown to the natives, and so I shall not adopt it. ANTOGH TAGH.—Lat. Long. Elev. A peak on the range between the Murad Chai and the sources of the Tigris, in the province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey. When Ainsworth saw it from near the village of Kizl Aghaj in July it had a good deal of snow on it, though this does not remain all the summer. The description of this autho rity is exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory on this point. (Ainsworth.) APSHERON—Lat. 40° 29' Long. 50° 30' Elev. A peninsula of the west coast of the Caspian Sea, formed by a spur running east from the Caucasus. Its heights and cliffs are composed of chalky rocks upon which here and there repose masses of a sort of brown freestone. The chalky rock exhibits in great numbers petrifications of the same kind of fish which still exist in the Caspian. About 30,000 lbs. of prepared saffron are annually exported from Apsheron, There are ten salt lakes on the penin sula, only one of which is worked, and this yields, notwithstanding defective management, 10,000 tons of salt annually. But much more might be ob tained. There are also a number of naptha pits, black and white, which are wrought by the Russian Government. The peninsula of Apsheron has been celebrated for many centuries in all the east countries as a sacred soil, and the fire-worshippers still make pilgrimages to adore the fires which then issue from the earth, arising from the ignition of the naturally formed naptha.

A celebrated mountain in Armenia, forming the point of contact of Russia with Turkey and Persia, to all of which it belongs. It lies in the south portion of the extensive plain of the Aras, about 35 miles 25 d26 All A broad, and of whose length about 70 miles can be taken in by tbe eye. It consists of two mountains, the Great Ararat on the north-west, and the Less Ararat on the south-east, their summits in a direct line being about seven miles apart, and their bases insensibly blending into each other by the inter position of a wide, level, upland valley. The summit of the Great Ararat lies in latitude 39° 42' North, longitude 43° 38' East, and is 17,323 feet above the sea level, and 14,320 feet above the plain of the Aras. The north-east slope of the mountain is about 14 miles in length, and the south west about 20 miles. On the former, visible even from Erivan, 32 miles distant, is a deep, gloomy, crater-like chasm. The mountain is covered with perpetual snow and ice for about three miles from its summit downward, in an oblique direction. On the entire north half, from about 14,000 feet above the sea, it shoots up in one rigid crest to its summit, and then stretches downward on its south side to a level not quite so low, forming what is called the Silver Crest of Ararat. Little Ararat rises 13,093 feet above the sea level, and 10,140 feet above the plain of the Aras, and is free from snow in September and October. Its de clivities are greater and steeper than those of the Great Ararat, and its almost conical form is marked with several delicate furrows that radiate downwards from its summit. The top of the Great Ararat was first reached on October 9th, 1829, by Professor Parrot, who reports it to be a ' gently vaulted, nearly cruci form surface, of about 200 paces in circuit, which at the margin sloped off pre cipitously on every side, but particularly towards the south-east and north-west. Formed of eternal ice, without rock or stone to interrupt its continuity, it was the austere silvery head of old Ararat/ Towards the east this summit is con nected, by means of a flattish depression, with a lower summit, distance 397 yards ; and in like manner covered with ice. After remaining on the summit three-quarters of an hour, determining the height, and making various observa tions, Parrot descended to the monastery of St. James; the third day after he left it. The observations of Parrot have been in every respect confirmed by another Russian traveller, named Abich, who reached the summit of the Great Ara rat without difficulty on July 29th, 1845. He, with six others, remained an hour on the top, without experiencing any inconvenience from cold, so much felt by Parrot and his companions. Abich, previous to making the ascent, had his tent for some time pitched on the upper slope of the mountain, in the valley between the two peaks, nearly 8,000 feet above the sea. He re ports the important fact that from this point the ascent can with facility be accomplished, few obstructions interfering with the progress of the traveller compared with those met with on the ascent from the monastery of St. James. It would appear even that the ascent of Mount Ararat is easier than that of Mont Blanc, for the height of the latter, above the valley of Chamouni, is 12,000 feet, while that of the former, above the point where Abich pitched his tent, cannot be above 9,000 feet, and the limit of perpetual snow is lower on the Swiss than on the Armenian Mountain. The sea son most suitable for the ascent is the end of July or beginning of August, when the summer attains its greatest heat, and when there is annually a period of atmospheric quiet, accompanied by a clear, unclouded sky. So soon, however, as the five days in the earlier part of August are over, the atmospheric war commences in the higher regions of the air, the strife being hottest between the two great peaks. Then there is no certainty of fine weather, for sudden thunderstorms, always on the higher parts of theARA mountains, accompanied by hail and snow, endanger the life of the traveller. This continual elemental strife has left, on the summit of the Little Ararat, an enduring memorial of its rigour in the lightning-tubes with which the rocks are bored. These tubes are covered with a greenish glass, which was formerly supposed to be obsidian. So numerous az-e they on the highest peaks that they impart to the rock the appearance of worm-bored wood. Wholly isolated on the north, south, and east sides this enormous mass shoots up abruptly from the plain on which it stands, in stupendous grandeur, to the eye, apparently exceeding in height the giants both of the Himalaya and the Andes. The north-west slope of this moun tain is partially connected with a chain, which, running west into Turkish Armenia, borders the entire right bank of the Aras; its west end, wheel ing round the head waters of that river, touches Arzrum, and gives to the left bank a mountain-barrier similar to that which exists on the right. All travellers attest the volcanic nature of the Ararat Mountains, as evidenced by the stones found on all their slopes, undoubtedly the products of a crater. They are composed chiefly of trachytic porphyry, and on them pumice and various descriptions of lava have been met with. Reineggs avers that he saw the Great Ararat send forth smoke and flame for three days, in 1785 ; but this is believed to be one of the many romances which that traveller has related. No such occurrence was remembered by individuals resident on the mountain at the period indicated, and no eruption is found recorded in the chronicles of the monastery of Echmiadzin, though they extend back over a period of 800 years. All doubt, however, as to the volcanic nature of the two Ararats was put an end to on July 2, 1840, when an eruption took place from the head of the great chasm, which de stroyed the monastery and chapel of St. James, the village of Arguri, and their inmates. Dr. Wagner, an enterprising German traveller and naturalist, who visited the spot in 1843, gives in substance the follow ing account of that event, as related by Sahatel Chotschaicff, brother to Stephan Aga, village elder of Arguri, honorably mentioned both by Parrot and Dubois, and confirmed by other two eye-witnesses :—' On July 2nd, 1840, half an hour before sun-set, the atmosphere clear, the inha bitants of Armenia were frightened by a thundering noise that rolled loudest and most fearfully in the vicinity of the Great Ararat. During an undulat ing motion of the earth, lasting about two seconds, which rolled from the mountain east and south-east and wrought great destruction in the districts of Sharur and Nakhshvan, a rent was formed in the end of the great chasm, about three miles above Arguri, out of which rose gas and vapour, hurl ing with immense force stones and earth over the slope of the mountain down into the plain. The vapour rose very quickly higher than the summit of Ararat, and seems to have been wholly of aqueous composition, for in the same night a heavy rain fell in the vicinity of the mountain, an unusual occurrence in this country during summer. The vapour at first was of various colours, in which blue and red prevailed. Whether flames burst forth could not be ascertained; but the pillars of vapour or smoke had a red tint, which, had the eruption taken place during the night, might possibly have exhibited flame. The blue and red tint of the vapour soon became dark black, and immediately the air was filled with a very disagreeable smell of sulphur. While the mountain continued to heave, and the earth shake, with the unre mitting thunder, along with the subterranean cracking and growling might •Z728 11 * —til Ill IIIWBIIIMH ill ARA be heard the whiz as of bombs caused by the force with which stones and large masses of rock, some upwards of 50 tons weight, were hurled through the air. Likewise, the dash of the stones as they met in the air in their flight could be distinguished from the thundering noise issuing from the interior of the mountain. Where these large stones fell there in general they lay, for, in consequence of the gentle declination of the ground at the foot of the mountain, to roll far was impossible. The eruption continued a full hour. When the vapour had cleared away, and the shower of stones and mud had ceased, the rich village of Arguri, the monastery and chapel of St. James, were not to be seen; all, along with their inmates, were buried under the mass of stones and mud that had been ejected. The earthquake, which accompanied the eruption, destroyed 6,000 houses in the neighbouring districts of Nakhshvan, Sharar, and Urdabad. Four days after a second catastrophe occurred, which spread still further the work of destruction at the foot of the mountain. After the rent in the chasm, whence issued the vapour and stones, had closed, there remained in the same place a deep basin filled with water by the melting of the snow, by the rain, and by a streamlet from above, so as to form a small lake. The mass of stone and clay, which formed a dam, and surrounded the lake like the edge of a crater, was burst by the weight of water, and poured down the declivity of the mountain with irresistible force in a stream of thick mud, which spread into the plain, and partly stopped up the bed, and altered the course of the small river Kar5si3. A part of the gardens of Arguri that had escaped the eruption were destroyed by this stream of mud, which canned trees, rocks, and the bodies of the inhabitants of the village down into the plain, and to the bed of the Karasu. This stream of mud was three times repeated, and was accompanied by subterranean noises/ ' A document, purporting to be an account of this remarkable occurrence, t A was drawn up by a llussian officer. Major Woskoboinikoff, who, however, did not approach the mountain nearer than Erivan, where he obtained his information solely from inhabitants of that town, who had visited the place after the eruption. He narrates that the mass which covered up St. James' monastery and Arguri was loosened by the earthquake from the highest regions of the mountain. This veracious document, preserved in the town archives of Tiflls, gave rise to the erroneous report that a part of Ararat had fallen, and that the snowy summit had considerably sunk, which story Dr. Wagner distinctly contradicts, not only from very perfect evidence derived from a minute investigation of the locality, but also from the concurrent testimony of numerous individuals who had spent their whole life on Ararat, and in its vicinity. Another fable, which has gained some currency, is that this mountain forms a landmark for the navigators of the Caspian Sea, to which a sufficient reputation is furnished by the fact, that the nearest point of the Caspian is about 260 miles distant. There are several glaciers on the Great Ararat, from one-of which flowed the stream that passed through the village of Arguri, the lowest being about 10,000 feet above the sea level. The fauna of Ararat is very poor, the only mammal, according to Wagner, being the common hare. Birds are tolerably numerous till about half way up the great chasm, beyond which they do not ascend. The most celebrated is the rose starling (Sturnus roseus), famed as a locust-killer. Insects are29 AHA numerous, among' which, as peculiar, may be noted the curiously formed coleojjier, callisthenes, araraticus. One reason for the small number of the mammalia is, doubtless, the want of water on the mountain, which at the same time causes a scant vegetation. Still many forms of plants are to be met with. The Great Ararat, on its north side at all events, has no trees, but on the Little Ararat, the birches form quite a forest, due no doubt to the greater moistness of the soil. In autumn, yellow achilleoe, white scabiosoe, and different kinds of compositoe, chiefly of red tints, are prominent. A few specimens of juniper us, oxycedrus, and cotoneaster uniflora are to be seen. The alpine vegetation is the same as on the Cauca sus, and the most frequently to be met with are aster alpinus and pulchellus, campanula saxifraga, pyretkrum caucasicum and cenfaurea pulcherrima. That Noah's ark rested on the top of Mount Ararat is not to be credited; the difficulty of the descent, and the low temperature of the atmosphere, which must have killed many of the animals, alike preclude the supposition; and, moreover. Scripture does not say it rested on the top, but merely ' on the Mountains of Ararat.' If this be the mountain there referred to, which is somewhat doubtful, seeing that the olive does not grow near it, the ark must have rested on one of its lower slopes. The name Ararat is said to be derived from Arai, a King who lived 1750 years before Christ. He fell in battle, in an Armenian plain, which was hence called Arai-arat, the fall of Arai. Before him reigned Amassis, the sixth from Japhet, who called the country Amasia; hence the name Massis, by which alone Armenians in the present day know the mountain. By the Turks and Persians it is called Agridagh. The third syllable dagh, means mountain, but philologists are not agreed on the signification of agri. [Imperial Gazetteer?) ARAS—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Armenia, which rises from the side of Bin Gol or 'mountain of a thousand lakes/ about 30 miles south of Arzrum and nearly in the centre of the space between the east and west Euphrates. It receives at its com mencement the name of Harharas from its many affluents. Its course from its first spring near Jabl Seihan is almost north-east for about 145 miles through Armenia, when it turns east being then near the frontier of Kars: this proximity continues for 110 miles, the river in all that extent running parallel to the frontier and eventually touching it for an instant at the south extremity, where it is joined by its first large tributary, the Arpa Chai, which comes from the north and forms the east boundary of Kars. On receiving this stream the Aras leaves the province, taking a south-east and tortuous course, between the foot of Mount Ararat and Erivan, opposite to which city the Karasu runs into it from the north, and a little further east it is joined by the Zenani, which also comes from the north and washes Erivan. The general direction after rounding Ararat continues as before south-east, the river separating the territory of Erivan from the district at the foot of that mountain. It receives on the right side in this part of its course the south Karasu, which comes by a north-east course from the Sani district and the-Ajlchai also from the south, whilst on the opposite or north side it is joined by the Zaighon, the small Arpa Chai, the north Karasu, the Abaran, and at the north extremity of Nakhshvan, by the great Arpa Chai, which forms the west limits of the province. Being thus augmented30 ara—arb it flows round the south border of Nakbshvan for nearly a distance of 38 miles to the fortress of Abbasabad, and here receives a third Arpa Chai in addition to other streams, viz., the Nakhsvan Chai and the Atendja Chai. As the country is here moderately level the course of the Aras continues to be tranquil as far as the village of Julfa, where it enters a rocky defile, extending 1 about 14 miles, and having- forced its way over a succession of cataracts it finally enters the level country with a noise which is heard at the distance of a mile. The Aras now bends to the north-east for a distance of about 35 miles along the district of Crdabad, where it is augmented by the Ghilan Chai, the Oustontron Chai, the Nenate Chai, the Ailisse Chai, and finally the Urdabad Chai. Jn quitting the latter village the course of the Aras becomes more tortuous, and it takes the general direction of north-east between the provinces of Karabagh and Karatagh, till it enters the extensive plain of Moghan. (The Persian army under AbbSs Mirza crossed here in the war of 1828-29. It consisted of six battalions and 12 guns and took 24 hours in crossing.) A little to the west of Moghan its width is about 350 feet, and it is crossed by a stone bridge of 15 arches in a very dilapidated state. A few miles short of this tract it is joined on the south side by a considerable tributary formed by two branches, viz, the Karasu, coming north-north-west from the mountains of Ghilan, and the Adhar, which falls into the former vbranch a few miles before it enters the Aras after a lengthened course from the mountains north of labrez. Having run about 35 miles through the plain of Moghan, where it receives the Bergasht stream on the left the Aras at some distance from their common estuary is joined by the Kur near the castle of Kalagan, whose length to the place of junction is greater than that of the former river. The river is extremely rapid, but occasionally fordable in many places during the summer. At Nakhshvan it is not more than 60 yards wide, and at Mergri, 55 miles north of Tabrez it is about 80 yards in breadth and 4 feet deep, and is a rapid foaming torrent, fordable only in one place about 1^ miles further up the river. A few miles below this place is a handsome bridge, thrown across the river by Abbas the Great. There is another bridge of seven arches each, double, of beautifully light construction at Choban K.opri, 4,500 feet elevation. This bridge was crossed by Paskievitz' army operating against Arzrtam in 1828-29, and is the spot where the Greeks under Zenophon supposed they had come to the banks of the Colchian Phasis, the streams being here called the Phasichai from the name of the district. There is another bridge at Hasn Kala of two arches only. The ferries over the Aras appear to be at Kargalik, Julfa, Tyrabad, Khuda Afrin, and the fords are U above Megri, at Aslandnz, and Zedi Baluk.

ARBEL—Lat. 36 0 11 / . Long. Elev. A town in province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, 56 miles south-east of Musal. It is situated in a fertile plain, but derives its chief interest from the celebrated battle of Arbela, in which Alexander the Great defeated Darius and decided the fate of Persia, B. C. 331. It subsequently formed part of the dominions of a family of Persian or Arabic Princes. It was at one time a large and important city, defended by a strong fortress on a conical hill, and capable31 ARB—ARD of containing a large garrison that stands on a large mound GO or 70 feet high, 900 feet long, and 000 feet wide. It is enclosed by a brick wall with bastions and contains three large mosques and two baths. At the foot of the mound is another town surrounded by a mud wall and nearly mined and deserted. Its population is 6,000 souls. Rich says that it is situated at the foot of the mount and only part of it on it. Shiel remarks that he saw no river near Arbel, and the people declared there was none. So it is an error to say it is on the right bank of the Little Zab River. (Kinneir—Rich— Skeil—Imperial Gazetteer.) AR13U,ZATvK—Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in Van, Asiatic Turkey, on the bank of the Ardish Chai, and at the north corner of Lake Van. It is situated in a small plain and is inhabited by about 100 Mahamadans and a very few Armenian families; they have a small and very ancient church. There is a castle here, the residence' of the petty governor of Ardish, which is in a most ruinous condition, the walls having fallen in many places, and as they do not reach down to the shore it is open towards the lake and may be said not to have any defences. The houses within the walls are in the style of the villages in the neighbourhood, half under ground. The territory within the jurisdiction of this petty Governor contains about 20 thriving and large village masses, and a few which are small and poor the inhabitants possess. The road crosses the plain in a straight line. Ihe Haidaranlis tribe of Kurds pasture their cattle on the neighbouring mountains and pass the winter on the villages belonging to Ardish. The winter is severe here, and a great deal of snow falls, but the cold is never so intense as at Arzrum; occasionally the lake here freezes firmly enough for people to cross over from Ardish to the oppo site side. They own a great number of cattle, sheep, and mares, as the pastures are extensive and fine. The soil is alluvial, deep, and very productive. It would appear that the plain of Ardish is gaining on the lake, in ten years32 ARD—ARI it having advanced one mile. Formerly along the shore there was an impas sable morass which the road to Ardish led ronnd. [Brant.) ARGHANA MADEN.—Lat. 38 0 13' Long. 39 o 10' Elev. 3,644 A town in Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, 36 miles north-west of Diarbakr town on the left bank of the Tigris, near its source. It is situated on Mount Taurus, on a declivity so steep that the houses appear to be piled one above another, and in winter the torrents rush down the street with a violence which often makes them impassable. It is wretchedly built and is inhabited by Turks and Kurds. Near it, at an elevation of 3,644 feet, there is a rich copper mine. The surrounding hills are covered with vineyards, and the town is noted for the quantity of wine made in its vicinity. Its population is about 4,000 souls. ARGHANEH.—Lat. Long. Elev.

Long. Elev. 5,400. A village in Russian Armenia, 186 miles south of Tiflls and 30 miles south west of Erivan, on the level ground at the end of the great chasm on the north east slope of Mount Ararat. This was formerly one of the largest and most beautiful villages in Armenia; its houses, all of stone, were enclosed in ccmrt-yards surrounded by stone walls, and it had a well-built church. A rivulet, which had its source in a glacier and passed down though the great chasm, had its outlet at the village and in conjunction with some spring wells afforded a plentiful supply of good water. The inhabitants, about 1,600 Armenians and a number of Kiirds, lived by rearing horses and cattle and by growing some corn, though at a distance from the village, the soil on the immediate neighbourhood being very strong. They also cultivated the vine, which according to tradition was first planted here, when he left the ark, whence the Armenian name of the village. Up the mountain, a short distance from Arguri, was the monastery and chapel of St. James, 6,375 feet above the sea. It stood on a grassy terrace, about 25 feet above the rivulet on the lower part of the chasm, which here has a depth of 600 to 800 feet. On 2nd July 1840 an eruption of Ararat over whelmed in one common destruction the village of Argiiri, the monastery and chapel of St. James, with their inhabitants and inmates, consisting of 1,500 Armenians, 400 Kurdish servants, and eight monks. Only 114 individuals escaped, who were engaged in the fields at a distance from the scene of calamity. Since the eruption the wells of the village have given forth discoloured water of a sulphurous taste. {Imperial Gazetteer.) AR1N. Lat. Long. Elev.

A plain in the province of Bayazld, Asiatic Turkey, extending from Diadin for 40 miles, with a breadth of 6 to 16 miles. The soil is rich and the plain abundantly watered, containing above 30 villages, three only of which have Armenian inhabitants, all the remainder being Kurds and Terekemehs. It seems comparatively deserted for the plain certainly could maintain double the number of the existing villages, even were they all large. [Brant.) ARJ1SH—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in province of Van, Asiatic Turkey, situate at the north-west side of the lake, 40 miles west by north from Van. It has a castle now in ruinous condition. In the neighbourhood are some beautiful gardens, and throughout the district large quantities of corn and cotton are produced. The Lake of of Van is sometimes called Lake Arjish. [Imperial Gazetteer) ARMENIA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A country of Western Asia, not now politically existing. It varied in extent at different epochs, and its precise boundaries are not now known ; but it may be regarded as lying between lat. 36° 50' and 41° 41' north, and long. 3() 0 20' and 48° 40' east. It was sometimes sub-divided into first, second and third Armenia, to which a fourth was afterwards added; but the divi sion by which it was almost universally known was into Armenia Major and Armenia Minor, or the Greater and the Less Armenia. The bounda ries of each, according to Colonel Chesney, the latest authority on the subject, and probably the best, are as follows :—Armenia Major, commencing at Sumeisat, stretches along the Euphrates, which bounds it on the west till near Arzinjan, a few miles to the south of which it quits the river, and keeps the direction of Tarabizun as far as the mountains south of Gumish Khana. It proceeds north-east along this range, then skirts the extremity of the district of Kars, and passing onward to near Tiflis becomes the right bank of the Kur, whose course it follows to its estuary in the Caspian which now becomes the boundary on the east. Leaving the Caspian, it turns south-west in the direction of Tabrez, and passes through the districts of \ an and Diarbakr, on the frontiers of which it again meets the Euphrates at Sumeisat. Armenia Minor, or as it might be called, the territory west of the Euphrates, lies along the range of the Kof-tagh, which runs west almost parallel to the Black Sea, and forms its north boundary as far as a point on the river Halys or Kizil-Irmak, not far from its estuary in the Black Sea. Armenia Minor follows the course of this river for about 180 miles, and continuing south-west meets the Tauras, which becomes its boundary almost to the sea, near Ayas, on the west side of the Bay of Iskandarun. From this point it sweeps round the south side of the districts of Adana and Marash, and meets the Euphrates, which thus intersects Armenia almost centrally, and forms the natural boundary between the two divisions now described. Armenia Major has an area of about 84,000 square niiles; Armenia Minor about 70,000. The territory of this once celebrated kingdom is now partitioned among Turkey, Persia, and Russia. The first of these powers possesses the largest share, being that which borders on the Euphrates, and includes the north part of Diarbakr, with Mush, Van, and 33 e84 ARM the Pashalic of Arzrum. The share of Persia forms part of Kurdistan, and almost the whole of Azarbijan. The share of Russia forms its Government of Armenia. It stretches along the river Aras, and is sometimes known as the district of Erivan. The plateau of which Armenia chiefly consists is mountainous and volcanic. The ridges, of which there are principally four, are generally parallel to each other, running with sundry deviations east and west, and between them are broad valleys and plateaux ; that of the Aras, at Mount Ararat, being 2,S &lt; ,)U feet, and many others 5,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The moun tains are mainly composed of trachytic porphyry, with slate, limestone, &amp;c., appearing on the sides of the chains, and sometimes rising up with the por phyry. Granite is also met with, but is not frequent; and in the north, in the Turkish province of Akalzik, tertiary fossiliferous formation is found*. Its volcanoes are all quiescent, unless we except Ararat, of which an eruption took place in 1840, accompanied by a disastrous earthquake. A few moun tains, as Ararat, Alagaz, and Bangol-digh, rise above the line of perpetual snow, but this is not generally the case; and there are no passes but can be crossed in a single day. Silver, lead, iron, and co])per are found in the mountains; and the last two have, to some extent, been wrought in modern times. Rock-salt is plentiful, and is exported in considerable quan tities to Persia and elsewhere. Mineral waters abound, but little or nothing is known of their constituents, or of their medicinal qualities. Several important rivers take their rise in Armenia, namely, the Kur and its tributary the Aras, flowing east to the Caspian Sea ; the Gchorak and the Kizil-irmak, flowing north to the Black Sea; and the Tigris and Euphrates, which flow into the Persian Gulf. There are also several minor tributary streams. The only considerable lakes are those of Van, 70 miles in length, and about 28 in breadth; Gokcha, Sevan, north-east of Erivan, about 40 miles long by 15 broad, and the Urumla. The climate of Armenia is very severe, presenting quite a contrast to that of the warm regions of the lower Euphrates, and to the mildness prevalent on the shores of the Black Sea. Any one, indeed, leaving the shores of the Black Sea in April, and travelling rapidly south, may in one week experience the delights and discomforts of three seasons of the year. On the shore of the Black Sea he leaves spring in her most beauteous garb; on the plateau of Arzrum he meets stiff cold winter, and sees before him a wide extent of country covered with snow and ice ; in Mesopotamia he finds approaching harvest, and the farmer busy with artificial irrigation to counteract the effects of the burning heat. Winter in Armenia continues from October to May, spring and harvest a month each, and the change to summer is very rapid. The heat, especially in the valleys, during summer is great, and rain seldom falls. In Erivan, which is a degree of latitude south from Tarabizun, the thermometer in winter falls 36° Fahr. lower than it does in the latter; and in summer it rises 24° Fahr. higher. On the plateaux of Arz rum, Gumri, &amp;c., the difference is still greater; indeed, in the town of Arzrum the snow lies in the streets for eight months of the year. East and south-east winds in summer, west winds in spring, and north-east storm winds in winter are most prevalent. Though severe, the climate is, however, esteemed healthy. Of the productions- of Armenia, the wheat and barley are particularly fine; nor is it very uncommon to have three succes-35 ARM sive crops of grain in some places. The gardens yield grapes in abundance, also oranges, peaches, nectarines, figs, apples, pomegranates, and other fruits. Honey, wax, manna, and gallnuts are exported from the more mountainous districts, where, especially eastward of Tarabizun, the finest timber is very abundant. The scenery here is at once beautiful and strikingly grand from various points of view, as the mountains are seen rising abruptly from the sea to an elevation of 4,000 and 5,000 feet, their sides being covered with dense forests, composed of gigantic chestnut, beech, walnut, alder, poplar, willow, elm, ash, maple, and box-trees, with firs towards their summits, and a magnificent underwood of rhododendron, bay, hazel, &amp;c. The less elevated grounds produce cotton, hemp, tobacco, and raw silk in abundance; besides precious stones, such as the turquois, beryl, crystal, pearl, and ruby. Besides the more valuable metals, gold and silver, Armenia abounds in copper, lead, iron, saltpetre, sulphur, bitumen, quarries of coal, marble, and jasper, with several mineral springs, which have been celebrated for many ages. T^he chief exports of this neglected and almost unknown country consist at present of copper, which is carried to Constantino-pie; also iron, silk, cotton, wine, tobacco and gallnuts. The Armenians are exceedingly fond of foreign commerce and home trade, both of which are prosecuted with such success that even the Jews are in many instances driven out of the field of competition. We find the industrious Armenians scattered over Arabia, Persia, and even the greater part of India in pursuit of gain. In the healthy territory of Armenia we meet with fine-looking peasants, of a powerful and robust frame, but rather dull and heavy in disposition. The people possess more of the passive and enduring than of the active qualities; and as the Armenian is generally without any fixed character of his own, he from habit moulds himself to that of his master or ruler, who ever that may happen to be. Consequently, we find him in turn become Turk, Persian, Russian, or Kurd, according to the circumstances in which he happens to be placed. The Armenians have been described as brave, a quality, however, which has long since passed from them; and we do not find that the people of this country have distinguished themselves in war since the days of Arme- nac, having been from that time either subject to other nations, or distracted by internal divisions. They are now a commercial and agricultural people, well clad, abundantly fed, and possessing sheep, cattle, and fine horses in great abundance. They live in warm and substantial houses, which are usually made of logs of tress deeply covered with earth, and generally consisting of four or five apart ments connected with each other. Two of these are allotted for the ani mals, and the remainder for the members of the family who are commonly very numerous. A large portion of the building is formed by excavating the side of a hill, and in such situations the villages or hamlets are almost invariably placed. The towns are Van, Erivan, Nakhshvan, Kars, Bayazid, Bitlis, Amadia, Mush, Sa'rt, and Diarbakr. The houses of the Armenians are thus described by Von Haxthausen. An Armenian farm usually comprises numerous small buildings, each devoted to some special purpose. At the entrance of the house is an open hall, which servesA KM in summer as the dwelling-room of the whole family. To the left of this is the winter apartment In cold weather a fire is lighted on the ground, t here being im raised hearth, and the smoke escapes at a small aperture in the loot. High up, in one corner, are two small windows. The walls and partitions are all strongly built, and contain numerous niches, which serve as receptacles for various things. In the upper part of the house are the ^ omen s apartments. Io the right of the dwelling-house is the wine house, and close by the bread-house; then the bake-house, the hay-house, and astly the cow-house, in which there is a raised partition, surrounded by a galleiy. A shed or fold is generally provided in the fields for the sheep. A Granger is struck with the great architectural resemblance of these buildings to those of an ancient lloman villa. The front of the house torms a vestibule, resting upon six pillars and approached by a flight of steps at the side. At the back of this vestibule, on the right, is a door opening into an anteroom; both have windows looking on to the gallery, but not [ r. e iiw g l 1 ' 7 ei 7 the walls are niehesf and the sides rf + 11 1 • n 5 d ] v } th P rett y arabesque ornaments. There are no ) es or chairs, nor indeed in any Armenian house. This is not properly the tlir Wl if , h r Se 1 0f . entor tainment for the most honored guests, which the family inhabit only in the summer. In the yard before this house stands a peculiar airy structure, or rather tall wooden frame-work, consisting o two gaUenes one above another, reached by steps. The building is open on all sides a light boarded roof affording the only shelter from the rain In these galleries all the inhabitants of the house sleep during the summer. Ihe most interesting place is the fine spacious shed for cattle, with a the^std 1 'V' 1 ! + * further e ' d ' shut in on three s^es, and open toward the stable; a flight of six stairs leads up to it. The family usually inhabit under^i F 61 ! f ^ winter; and m an evening collect around'the fire, unrtei a kind of chimney; hither also resort the neighbours and village f'! tlie 0&lt;,nv ersation turns upon topics of personal interest and the affairs of the village.

The family constitution and domestic life of the Armenians are quite of a patriarchal character ; but in one respect they differ fundamentally from the other Asiatic nations,—the social position which woman occupies, the re cognition of her independence, and her claims to an equality of respect and dignity. A remarkably strong national bond exists among the Armenians ; although the majority of this people are scattered over three quarters of the globe, in no country has their nationality been effaced, nowhere has it become absorb ed in that of the people among whom they dwell. The patriarchal character of the Armenian nation is reflected in the microscosm of their family life. There are few people among whom the domestic tie is stronger or more intimate. During the lifetime of the father or mother, the whole family dwell together, in strict obedience to their head; the property remains undivided, until the succession of the grand-chil dren, and no member can possess anything apart from the rest; all is com mon property. Not unfrequently a patriarch of eighty years will be living in the same household with three generations,—perhaps four or five married sons of fifty or sixty, grand-children of twenty or thirty, and again their children. In this manner upon some farms will be found families of forty or fifty members : even the brothers separate with great reluctance. Upon the death of the parents, the eldest son usually succeeds as the head of the house, and inherits the paternal privileges. But although obedience to the head of the family is a strong bond of union, experience would not lead us to expect any permanent harmony among five or six young married women in the same household. If, however, it is ever possible, it would be so among the Armenians, from the peculiar education of their women, which is unique, and indeed rigorous, although neither slavish nor oppressive. The young unmarried people of both sexes enjoy perfect liberty within the recognized limits of manners and propriety. Custom is here precisely the reverse of what prevails in the surrounding countries, whilst in the latter the purchase of a wife is the only usual form of contracting a marriage, until which time the girl remains in perfect seclusion; among the Armenians on the contrary, the young people of both sexes enjoy free social intercourse. The girls go where they like, unveiled and bare-headed ; the young men carry on their love-suits freely and openly, and marriages of affection are of com- * mon occurrence. But with marriage the scene changes: the word which the young woman pronounces at the altar in accepting her husband is the last that is for a long time heard from her lips. From that moment she never appears, even in her own house, unveiled. She is never seen abroad in the public streets, except when she goes to Church, which is only twice in the year, and then closely veiled. If a stranger enters the house or garden she instantly conceals herself. With no person, not even her father or brother, is she allowed to exchange a single word; and she speaks to her husband only when they are alone. W ith the rest of the household she can only communicate by gestures, and by taking on her fingers. This silent reserve, which custom imperatively prescribes, the young wife maintains 37ARM until she has borne her first child, from which period she becomes gradually emancipated from her constraint: she speaks to her new-born infant; then her mother-in-law is the first person she may address ; after a while she is allowed to converse with her own mother, then with her sisters-in-law, and afterwards her own sisters. Now she begins to talk with the young girls in the house, but always in a gentle whisper, that none of the male part of the family may hear what is said. The wife however is not fully emancipated her education is not completed, until after the lapse of six years, and even then she can never speak with any strangers of the other sex, nor appear before them unveiled. . From customs moreover arises an intimate, an absorbing and exclu- sive relation in the married state—the wife's very existence becomes part of her husband's; she lives in him and has intercourse with the world only through him. This seclusion lasts for years,—it grows into a habit; the dose intimacy of marned life has time to be matured and confirmed, and the wife s chaiacter is unfolded and strengthened in her early years; she has been screened from the temptation and opportunity for indulging in scandal and intrigue, and it is unlikely that she should gain a taste for this in after-life • and when, after her probation, she acquires the liberty of speech, she learns to use this privilege with discretion. In short, marriages among the Armenians are generally patterns of conjugal happiness. The Armenian women do not wear so entire a veil as the Mahamadan. It leaves the eyes at full liberty, and just encloses the nose, by which some general idea may be formed of the features and expression of the face lhat which covers the lower part of the face is so very tightly compressed that the nose of every Armenian woman is flattened as broad as a negro's. 1 heir features are broad and coarse, their complexions are fair and ruddy, and their eyes black but their countenances in general excite but little interest. VV hen they go from home they cover themselves with a large white veil from head to foot In the house they still wear the noseband, which is never laid aside even m bed. Their dress consists of a silk shift, a pair of silk trowsers, wmen reach to the ankles, a close garment, which fastens at the throat with sil ver claps, and an outer garment, generally made of padded chintz, and open all the way m front They wear a silver girdle, which rests on the hips, and is generally curiously wrought. Their feet are naked, and some of them wear sil ver nngs round their ankles. No hair is seen, excepting a long plaited tail that hangs over the back to the ground. On their heads they place a species of cusluon, which expands at the top.

Moreover, excluded from rank, honour, and office, the acquisition of property and wealth becomes the sole object of their ambition. Nevertheless, this class of the Armenian people appear in a different light, and entitled to respect, when living in their own homes, in Turkey and Persia, amidst their ancient patriarchal purity of manners: here they exhibit all the domestic virtues, are benevolent and hospitable, adhere strictly to their national customs, and above all to their religion. Indeed, with the exception of the Jews, there is no nation which has suffered so much for its religion, or has had so many martyrs, as the Armenians, yet they have never wavered in their adherence to their faith. We must therefore regard their faults not as appertaining to the original character of the people, but only as the growth of peculiar circumstances; and the more so as the natives of Armenia, in their own homes, are thoroughly honest and trusty. The old traveller, Tournefort, who was well acquainted with them, praises them as ' the best and most honest nation in the world.' The Armenian country-people living under the Turkish dominion, around Bayazid, Arzrnm, and Van, are said to be more grave, honest, and strict in morals than those around Erivan. The Armenians embraced Christianity in the fourth century; and in A.D. 536 separated from the Greek Church, being dissatisfied with the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon. In doctrine, they hold that there is only one nature in Christ, and that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father alone. They have seven sacraments, but in the mode of using them differ in seve ral respects from the Roman Catholics. They adore saints and images, but do not believe in purgatory. Their hierachy differs little from that of the Greeks. The Catholicus, patriarch or head of the church, has his seat at Echmiadzin, a monastery near Erivan. A minority of the Armenians, chiefly those residing in European countries, acknowledge the Pope and con form in doctrine and church government to the Roman Catholic Church. They are called United Armenians. The monastery of Echmiadzin, the seat of the Catholicus, or head of the Armenian Church, lies in the valley of the Aras, 13 miles east of Erivan. The Armenian language belongs to the most distant off-shoots of the Indo-Germanic root; but still, in its form and structure, has much that is peculiar; and to the ear it is harsh and dissonant. The old Armenian language, also called Haican, which is that of literature, may now be consi dered a dead language. In the new Armenian language, which is divided into four dialects not differing greatly from each other, there are many Turkish words, and the construction of sentences is regulated by the rules of Turkish syntax. With exception of some songs preserved by Archbishop Moses Choronensis, no specimens of the earlier Armenian literature have been preserved. After the introduction of Christianity, a great taste for the Greek language and literature arose, and a number of works in Greek and40 ARM—ART Syriac wore translated into Armenian. Before A.D, 400, the Armenians hud no alphabet of their own, but used indifferently Greek, Syriac, or Persian characters. In that year, however, Mesrop Ma«doty invented the Haicau alphabet, consisting- of 38 letters (30 consonants and eight vowels) called from its inventor, Mesropian, and which still continues to be employed along- with the modern alphabet. Armenian literature flourished from the 4th to the 14th century. Of this period, many writers have obtained a name chiefly as historians and chroniclers. Their works, which might throw considerable light on the history of the east during the middle ages, have hitherto been little consulted. Armenian literature began to sink in the 14th century, and since that period scarcely any original work of import ance has appeared; but, in all their wanderings, the Armenians have pre served a taste for native literature, and have set up printing presses where- ever they have settled, so that we find Armenian works printed in Amster- dan, Venice, Leghorn, Lemberg, Moscow, Astrakan, Constantinople, Smyrna, Echmiadzin, Ispahan, Madras, Calcutta, Batavia, &amp;c. The most interesting colony is that on the island of San Lazaro at Venice, founded by Abbot Mechitar Pedrosian in 1717, who there established a monastery, academy, and printing press, whence important Armenian works continue to be issued down to the present time. {Imperial Gazetteer—Van Haxthausen.) ARNIS—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in province Van, Asiatic Turkey, at the extreme north-east corner of Lake Van. It is inhabited by Kurds who are exempted from taxation on condition of looking after the security of the road between Van and Bayazid and the entertainment of passengers. {Brant). ARPAH CHAI—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Armenia rising in the Abotz Mountains in Georgia and flowing by south past Gnmri and Ani falls into the Aras after a course of about 110 miles. During the greater part of its course it forms the boundary between Russia and Asiatic Turkey in this direction and guards of the former Asiatic power stationed at intervals along it to prevent marauders from beyond their border crossing. Near its source it is a mere torrent, almost dry in summer but increasing on the melting of the snow. Below Gumrie it becomes a rapid river, full of large loose stone that are frequently carried along with great force by the violence of the stream. At Hajee Bairamtu it is about 100 yards in breadth increasing where it approaches its confluence with the Aras. The breadth varies considerably according to the seasons or the quantity of rain that falls or snow that melts. The ford at Haji Bariamlu is an exceedingly difficult one on account of the current and boulders. (Morier.) ARSHAT—Lat. Long. Elev. An ancient castle in the Province Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, in the valley of a tributary of the Batman Su, 120 miles north-east of Diarbakr. At the base of the rock on which it is built there is a fine and spirited representation in very high relief of a Parthian warrior on horseback. AR FAX AT A—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruined city on the Aras River, 68 miles south south-east of Erivan, formerly capital of Armenia and built by King Artaxes. ARTLM1D—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Province Van, Asiatic Turkey, 8 miles south of Van. It is a large Armenian village of about 350 houses, placed on some heights above theART—ARZ shores of the lake and completely buried in orchards throughout which the houses are dispersed. The g-ardens of Artemid are watered by a canal from the Anjelchai. Great quantities of fruit are produced here, and a good trade in dried apricots is carried on. {S/ilel—Brant.) ARTVIN—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the province of Tarabiziin, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of the Tchorak river. The houses are all of wood with the exception of a few stone buildings belonging to the Turks. It contains a large Roman Catholic Church and has some manufacture of cotton cloth and a considerable trade in butter, honey, wax, olives, and oil. Population 5,500, chiefly Roman Catholics. ARZEN—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruined city in the province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, on the Arzen Sii, east of Diarbakr. The ruins are very extensive, enclosed by a wall, and com prise an area of 2,7U0 square yards. [Taylor?) ARZEN SD—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the Modikan Mountains in Diar bakr and flowing south past Huzu, Arzen, and Redoan falls into the Tigris, 15 miles below the last place and after a course of about 80 miles. {Taylor.) ARZRCTM.—Lat. 38 0 4.2' to ^l 0 ?' Long. 39 o 10' to 44 o 30' Elev. A Pashalic of Asiatic Turkey, bounded north by the Provinces of Tarabizfin, Kars and Akhalzik, east by Baazid, south by Van, Mush, and Diarbakr, and west by Sivas. Its length is 230 miles and its breadth 130 miles. It is a lofty plateau, very mountainous, and has a long cold winter accom panied with heavy falls of snow and a short very hot summer. It is watered by the head streams of the Euphrates, Aras, and Tchorak. It is treeless and has a poor soil, but is well cultivated and has excellent pastures. It is divided into 12 districts.— [Chesney, fyc.) ARZROM.—Lat. 39° 55' 20'' Long. Elev. A town, capital of the Pashalic of the same name, in Asiatic Turkey, situated in an extensive and fertile plain, between 30 and 40 miles in length by 15 to 20 miles in breadth. It is composed of a central portion called the ark of a citadel, surrounded by a wall and extensive suburbs stretching out on all sides. The streets are narrow and filthy and infested with savage dogs. The outer town appears to be about eight miles in cir cumference and to have been surrounded by a mound and ditch. The houses are built of dark grey stone; they consist of one or two stories, and the windows open upon the streets. The most busy and crowded spot is the glacis which surround the inner city. This presents a most bustling and lively appearance, being thronged with a motley assemblage of Kurds, Persians, Armenians, Georgians, and Turks, exhibiting their various physical characteristics and different costumes. The citadel of Arzrum is well placed on rising ground, immediately above the east walls of the town, and is a commanding object from a distance. A respectable battery enfilading the road to Russia has been constructed, and the citadel mounts a good many antiquated long brass guns. It is surrounded by a double wall and flanked by bastions. 41 r42 ARZ—ASH There are here several respectable bazaars, some clean and well attended baths, a large custom-house, and no fewer than .'56 caravanserais, numer ous mosques and minarets, many of them, however, in ruins. Although an old town, Arzrnm boasts of but few antiquities : the most remarkable is the Chifteh Minar, so called from two lofty minarets now in ruins. The archi tecture of this structure is a modification of Byzantine and Saracenic; the minarets are composed of red and blue glazed bricks, deep fluted. It appears to have been originally a church, but is now occupied as an arsenal. The principal manufactures of Arzrum are morocco, leather, carpets, silk and cotton fabrics, and articles in iron and brass, the former comprising swords and horse shoes, the latter drinking cups and candle-sticks. It has also an extensive transit trade, being on the great line of travel between Constan tinople and the eastern portion of the Turkish Empire. It has been esti mated that £300,000 worth of British goods pass through this town annually. Its population is variously estimated at from 25,000 to 50,000 souls. It was taken by the Russians under General Paskiwitch in 1828.— {Kinneir—Chesney—Stuart—Glasscott.) AROZ SU—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the Bingol Tagh and passing the town of Khinis (where it is spanned by two bridges of single arches) falls into the Murad Chai. It is called the Kaleh bu higher up. {Brant.) ASA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river which rises in the Caucasus and falls into the Terek. {Abic/i.) ASAERD. See Sert. AS AS AMUR—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the Sinjar Mountains and after a long course falls into the Tigris at Kala Shirkat. [Ckesney.) ASH KALA—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Province of ArzrtJm, Asiatic Turkey, 27 miles west of the town of that name, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates near its source. It is prettily situated under a rock among low willows and other shrubs and con tains 50 families. [Ouseley—Suter.) ASH RAF—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Van, Asiatic Turkey, in the north shore of Lake Van. It is inhabited by Armenians. {Brant.) ASHTAREK—Lat. Long Elev. A village in the District of Erivan, Georgia, Russia, 13 miles south -west of Erivan, 16 miles of Uch Kilisa, on the banks of the Ashtarek River, which, running through a very deep channel of rock, winds through the plain and falls into the Aras near Echmiadzin. It is situated in a beautiful and romantic spot, but only now contains 20 families of Armenians. It bears the marks of having once being a place of more importance as in the vicinity43 ASM are ruins of some churches and the bridge over the river is of excellent con struction. Here a battle was fought in 1828 between the Persians under Abbas Mirza and a force of 3,000 Russians escorting a large convoy. The action which took place along the whole extent of road was very sevcie, and the loss of the Russians amounted to 1,200 men, while that of the ieisians did not exceed 300 to 400, besides which the latter succeeded in carrying off a considerable portion of the convoy. [Morier ALontelth.) ASH0RADA—Lat. Lorn?. Elev. to* A harbour belonging to Russia on the south coast of the Caspian 8ea. It is formed by the promontory called Mian Kala, which runs out from the main land near Ashraf into the Caspian, curving eastwards and is 15 miles in length. At its east extremity is a passage with eight or ten feet of water, about half mile in width. Ihen comes the island of Great Ashurada, the length of which is H miles and the breadth three-sevenths of a mile. There is then shoal water for half a mile followed by the island of Little Ashurada, two miles in length, then a shoal and a narrow passage (fast filling up) of 15 feet of water, and then a shoal for half a mile to the Turkman coast. The harbour of Ashuraxla is therefore^ land-locked, having the Persian coast to the south and east and jNlTan Ivala and the two Ashuradas to the west and north. The whole extent of the harbour is 20 miles from west to east and eight miles from north to south and ships drawing 20 feet of water might anchor off Ashurada. On the island, which some years ago was quite uninhabited, is the residence of the Russian Com modore, a good garden, a library, a church, a hospital, some 20 or -30 huts lor married sailors, and four barracks, capable of holding 50 men each. Ihere is besides a well of good water and any amount of water is found near the surface. The strength of the Russian Navy kept up at this station was in 1862, eight war-steamers, five sloops, six merchantmen, which are capable of transporting 10,000 men to any point of the coast. The position of Ashurada is well chosen ; it is near Astarabad, the Giirgan and the high road to Mashad and Herat, and also to the passes into the table land of Persia. The story of the acquisition of this important position is thus told by Shiel. In 1841, immediately after the Kabal massacre, Haji Mirza Aghassi, the Prime Minister of Persia, a man half mad and wholly Russian, asked Russia to lend Persia for a short time one or two small ships of war to hold in check the lurkmans of the mainland. With the most amiable and neighbourly cordiality Russia replied that she would save Persia all trouble and come herself to punish the marau ders. Two vessels-of-war forthwith appeared and soon after established themselves at Ashurada, from whence they have never since moved. Now not a boat is allowed to move in the Caspian without a Russian passport and even Persian boats are under the same restriction. Persia has frequently remonstrated in vain against this procedure. No attempt, says Shiel, has yet been made for forming an establishment on the mainland among the Turk mans. When the day for that arrives the Gfirgan will doubtless receive a preference. Its banks are on the high road to Mashad and are covered w T ith the richest pastures ; and the climate and the soil are suited for the production of abundant harvests of corn. No better spot could be found44 ASH—AST for subsisting' an army or for being made the basis of a plan of military operations to the east. [Holmes—Shiel—JEastwick.) ASKERAN—Lat. Long. Elev.

The tribute levied on them is usually 12,000 Shamies annually, but unless threatened it is only partially paid. Of fire-arms they can muster about 400 and can perhaps bring double the number of mounted spearmen into the field. Their war-cry is ' Akhuyet Hamdeh.' They are rich in Arab estimation, and possess large flocks and herds of cattle besides camels. They give protection too to a few buffalo proprietors and are much feared by native trading vessels. [Jones.) ASTRAK AN—Lat. 44° 40' to 49° 45' Long. 43° 5' to 51° o A Government of Russia in Europe, on the north-west coast of the Caspian Sea, having the Maloi Uzen for its north-east boundary and the Manitch for its south-west. It is divided into two nearly equal parts by the Volga, which traverses it from north-west to south-east. Its coast line, excluding minute sinuosities, is about 520 miles in length, and is crowded throughout its whole extent by small islands, rocks, and shifting sand-banks. The entire length of the province is 370 miles, its greatest breadth 250 ; area 83,000, square miles, or 51,480,000 English acres. It consists almost wholly of45 AST two vast steppes or plains, separated from each other by the Volgu, the g-reater portions of which are arid sterile desert. The largest tracts of this description are the deserts of Naryn and Sedok, the former, in which occur hills of moving sand, on the north-east side of the Volga, the other on the south-west. The whole of Astrakan was at one period submerged by the Caspian, as is evident from the saline nature of the soil and the shells it contains ; and as both are upwards of 80 feet below the level of the Sea of Azof, should any convulsion of nature cause a depression of the intervening land, Astrakan would again be overwhelmed by the ocean. The soil consists generally of mud, salt, and sand, intermixed, and in some parts of extensive salt marshes, rendering it almost wholly one wide and sterile waste, destitute of wood, the few trees it has to boast of being met with on the banks of its rivers only. These are oaks, poplars, birches, and some mulberry trees, the latter of which are found in greatest numbers along the Aktuba. Notwithstanding the general sterility of the country, a few fertile tracts are met with on the skirts and delta of the Volga, including some excellent pastures. Here corn is grown, but not in sufficient quantity to maintain the population, with some fruit, herbs, vines, tobacco, and cotton. Salt lakes and pools are numerous throughout the province, and the largest of the former, Baskutchatek, is situated to the east of the Volga, and is about 12 miles in length and 5 in breadth. When evaporated in summer, these lakes and pools have thick crusts of culinary, and, in some cases, Epsom salt. In this district, low hills of gypsum and rock salt also occur, the former vary in size and elevation, the highest rising about 60 feet above the level of the steppe; they are mostly of semi-circular form, and many of them are cratershaped at the top. The salt hills rise to about the same height, and contain gem salt, above which is sand-stone, and over that the common yellow sand of the steppe. The salt is colourless, firm, and contains clear and perfectly transparent cubes. The principal rivers of Astrakan are the Volga, the Aktuba which runs parallel to it at the distance of 2 or 3 miles, and the Sarpa. The Ruma, which once formed a part of the south boundary of the province, does not now reach the Caspian Sea, being absorbed by the sands 60 miles inland. The climate is extremely hot in summer, and equally cold in winter, and is unhealthy to all biit natives, from the quantity of saline particles with which the atmosphere is impregnated. Pasturage and fishing constitute the principal occupation of the inhabitants; the former of the rural and nomadic tribes; the latter of the population on the coast and banks of the Volga. The live stock consists chiefly of sheep of the broad- tailed breed. Cattle and goats are also reared, the latter principally for their skins, from which Morocco leather is made. The breeding of horses likewise obtains some attention, but they are diminutive and ill-conditioned. The fisheries of the A olga are of great value, no stream in the w r orld being more abundantly stocked with fish, particularly between the city of Astrakan and the Caspian, a distance of about 25 to 30 miles. On this ground, an immense number of vessels and boats, and many thousand persons, are employ ed in spring, autumn, and winter, in taking fish, chiefly sturgeon, from the roes and bladders of which large quantities of isinglas and caviare are manufactured.46 AST The population is composed of a great variety of races, including' Russians, Cossacks, Tartars, Kalmucks, Indians, Persians, Armenians, &amp;c. 1 he most numerous are the Kalmucks, who occupy larg'e tracts to the east of the Volga. They are a mild and intelligent people, but addicted, it has been said, to dishonesty. Astrakan is politically divided into four circles— Astrakan, Krasuo \arsk, \enotawyevvsk, and Tcherno-Yarsk. The popu lation of the Government in 1850 was 290,000. (Imperial Gazetteer.) ASTRAKAN—Lat 4G 0 25 / Long 48 o 0 , Elev. A city in Russia, capital of above Government, on an elevated island in the A olga, about 30 miles from its embouchure in the Caspian Sea. Jt is irregularly built, its streets are crooked, mostly unpaved and dirty, being covered with mud in winter and with sand in summer. Some of the houses are of brick or sandstone, but by far the greater number are of wood. Of streets, there are altogether 146; square or public areas, 40; market-places, eight; 11 wooden and nine earthen bridges. In the upper part of the town stands the Cathedral, from the towers of which, savs Dr. ( roebel, a fine view of the city is obtained, with its broad streets and canals bordered by trees, the haven covered with ships, and of the broad majestic A olga, with its beautiful green islands. The Cathedral is in the form of a parallelogram, with four small gilt and painted cupolas on the roof, and a large one in the centre for the admission of light. Its walls inside are hung with coarsely painted pictures, set in costly frames, mostly of silver filigrane work. Ihere are besides 31 stone and three wooden churches, and 15 mosques, many of the former richly ornamented and gaudily furnished. 1 he other public buildings of note are the Archiepiscopal Palace, the (rovernment Offices, and the three factory halls, for the Russian, Asiatic, and Hindu dealers or merchants. An interesting architectural antiquity is a small disused Moresco Church, in the fort of Peter the Great, said to have been built by order of Joan IV. Astrakan is the seat of a Greek and Armenian .Ecclesiastical Eparchy, also of Greek and Armenian Archbishop rics. It contains a High Court of civil and criminal jurisdiction, also a Greek theological seminary, a botanic garden, a gymnasium, and upwards of 20 superior and ordinary schools, with about 1,000 scholars of all ranks. The manufactures are inconsiderable, not giving employment to more than 200 work-people; they comprise silks, cottons, woollens, shagreen skins, morocco leather, and soap. The fisheries form the staple trade of the citv, immense quantities of fish, caviare, and isinglas being exported to foreign countries. In the fishing seasons, from 20,000 to 30,000 persons connected with the fisheries resort to the city. The haven of Astrakan is now so sanded up as to leave only six feet depth of water, so that large vessels have to land their cargoes on an island near the Caspian. A few steam tug boats are employed in taking vessels up and down the river. In 1846 three iron steamers were started to ply between Astrakan and the other ports of the Caspian. Previous to that period there was but one steamer on the &gt; olga, and it was of only 40-horse power. Iresh water being scarce in the city, some attempts were lately made to obtain an increased supply by Artesian wells, hut none was found at a depth ot 400 feet. From some of the borings, however, there issued streams of car-47 ATA—ATS bonic hydrogen g-as, which readily burned with a clear flame. The population, as in the case of the province generally, consist of various races; but most of the trade of the place is in the hands of the Tartars and Armenians, the latter of whom are also the chief cultivators of the land in the vicinity. The city was once fortified in the oriental manner; and many vestiges of Tartar residence are met with in the neighbourhood, including numerous graves, the stones of which have been taken by the inhabitants to form ovens. Several of the old embattled towers, and portions of dilapidated walls still remain. In summer, when the thermometer seldom falls below 98° in the daytime, the air is filled with gnats and other small insects, which are a source of much annoyance. The resident population of the town in 1842 was 45,703. (Imperial Gazetteer.) AT ASH J a H—Lat. Long. Elev. A spot on the peninsula of Apsheron, on the west coast of the Caspian, 12 miles north of Bakfl, the object of numerous pilgrimages by the Guebres, who regard it as sacred and worship the fire which issues from it by the ignition of the naptha with which the soil is thoroughly impregnated. The Atash Jah is about one mile in diameter, and from its centre, when the weather is dry, emits an yellowish-blne flame visible by day, but of course much increased in intensity during the night. A number of cottages are erected in the neighbourhood, and the inhabitants by several simple devices apply the light to economical purposes. To prevent the escape of the naptha vapour they cover their floor with abqut a foot of loam leaving small holes which they can open or shut at pleasure. To kindle a fire they have only to open a hole and hold a»light over it when a conti nuous flame is immediately obtained. An opening of two inches has been known to give a flame of about four feet. To regulate the flame, a hollow reed of the size required, and previously coated with lime by the transmis sion of lime water, to prevent it from being consumed is placed in the aperture. The vapour is perceptible, and hence though both light and heat are obtained for nothing, the probability is that being prejudicial to health they are dearly purchased. There is a temple here built by one Utamchand, a Hindu, and now the flame issues from an opening in its centre and out of five hollow pillars a foot in diameter and to a height of four feet a bright flame waving heavily and slowly from side to side against the dark sky, a truly mar vellous and spectral sight. There is a small colony of HindQshere, who have come overland from India. (Kinnier—Imperial Gazetteer— Van Haxthausen.) ATENJA CHAI—Lat. Long. Elev.

It is mountainous and sterile inhabited by the Avars, a tribe of Lesghians, governed by a Khan and is nominally subject to Russia. The Avars are Mussulmen and live by the chase and by plunder. To prevent their predatory incursions on the surrounding tribes an annual sum is paid to the Khan by Russia, and the rank of Lieutenant-General is given him. Their numbers are placed by Monteith at 82,000 families. Malcolm states that the Avars are of Tartar descent, who, driven out of their own country, solicited and obtained permission to settle within the limits of the Roman Empire. In the campaign of 1828-29 the Avars submitted to the Russian General Rievsky. {Monteith.—Malcolm.—Chesney.—Imperial Gazetteer?) K\ ATAK—Lat. Long. Elev.

At one time they held the mountain tract south of Mfish in lawless independence, permitting neither caravan nor passenger to pass through it without payment. They were, however, attacked in the Spin valley by Rashid Pasha, and being signallv defeated they submitted and lost all their property and arms and had to furnish 300 recruits to the Pasha. Elev. badli- Lat. Lon A village in Kurdistan, situated about 50 miles north of Musal at the sources of the Khausser river under the mountains.

A town in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, situated to the east of Baghdad, close to the Khiiizistan frontier and 40 miles from Mandali. It is surrounded by fine gardens. The districts around it are said to be damp and marshy, interspersed with pools of water, the receptacles of the torrents that in the spring continually rush from the mountains. (Kinneir.) bagara— ; A tribe of Fellahin Arabs who inhabit, in common with other tribes subject to the Shamr Arabs, the country to the north of Nisibin in Kurdistan. They number about 1,000 families and pay tribute to the Shamr in money, g-rain. and cattle. BAGHDAD— Lat. 33° 20' Long. 44° 25' Elev. A city, capital of the pashalic of the same name in Asiatic Turkey, situated on both banks of the Tigris, 190 miles above its junction with the Euphrates. The city is in two parts, one on either bank of the Tigris, the larger being on the left bank. The shape of the portion on the left bank is that of an irregular parallelogram, of which the river face measures 0 380 yards, the east face 2,704 yards, the northern 2,804 yards, and the southern 1,690 yards. The portion on the right bank has more the shape of a triangle, the sides of which however are irregular as follows : the south side which commences immediately opposite the British Residency has a length of 640 yards, the western side of 1,352 yards, the north-western of 9G2 yards, the north of 338 yards, and river frontage of 2,868 yards. 1 he enclosed area within the walls contains 737 acres, of which the east portion extends over 591 acres, and the west over 146 acres. The city is surrounded by a wall of brick-work built in a very irregular manner round the buildings and is now in a very dilapidated state in many parts. It has 10 round towers, half enclosed within the outer wall, which, where they are situated, forms a sort of semi-lune around them. These are solid construc tions of brick with embrasures and some few cannon on each. The wall rises 49 o Elev.50 BAG from a ditch originally about. 18 feet deep to the same height above the plain beyond. A strong embankment girds the ditch on the outside; and situated at irregular intervals between the round towers are buttresses, or half bastions of unequal dimensions, to give strength to the escarp or revet ment of the wall, as well as to protect it by a flanking fire, being, like the wall itself, loopholed for musketry. On the inside this wall is exposed only for 13 feet, the rest being concealed by a thick rampart of earth which strengthens it and serves at the same time to protect the enceinte from inundations of the rivers which fill the moat and press hard on the fortification. The wall affords some shelter to its defenders by being poorly arched, some what in the form of casemates; over these is a roadway a few feet broad, the top of the wall which is embattled acting as a parapet above it. Four gates with solid bridges (in execrable repair) originally led to the plains beyond. Three only are now open, namely, the north-west or Bab-al-Moadhein, the south-east or Bab-al-Sherki, and the east, or middle gate, or Bab-al- Wastani. The Bab-al-Talism has been closed since Sultan Morad IV. issued from it on his departure for Constantinople after capturing the city from the Persians. The circuit of the east fortifications including the river face is 10,600 yards, and of the west side 5,800, making an entire length of 16,400 yards, or 9 miles furlongs nearly. The state of the walls is however such as to offer scarcely any impediment to a well-appointed force, as a breach could be effected anywhere in a few minutes' cannonade; and the numerical strength of the garrison and fighting population is so small as to be incapable of covering the defences. Jones has the following list of the quarters of the town, numbered to agree with his plan of the place :— 1. Mahala Sukal Ghaxil, in which is situated the Juma Sukal Ghazil, the most ancient in the city and the thread market. 2. Mahala Ras-al-Kerieh or Gereyeh. 3. Mahala Syad Sultan All, in which is the mosque of Syad Sultan AIT. 4. Mahala Aat Aghazi. 5. The quarter of the Jews with their principal synagogue. 6. Mahala Gambar All. 7. On this quarter is the mosque of Jama Mesjanizeh and a Khan attached to it, 8. In this quarter is the Khan-al-Howitmeh, an ancient edifice of peculiar Saracene construction with vaulted roof and said to have been an ancient Christian Church. 9. Mahala Haidarkhana, in which is a mosque of the same name, built in 1827. 10. In this quarter is the mosque. Jama Ahmad Reza, built in 1796. It is a very handsome edifice with an enamelled dome. 11. Mahala Husen Pasha. 14. Mahala Aakalizeh. 12. Mahala al Fadel. 16. Mahala Jama Kadir Beg. 13. Mahala Bab-al-Agha. 16. Mahala al Aadelizeh. 17,18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 are small quarters along the bank of the river from above the British Residency to the bridge of boats. 25. Mahala Saffafir is north of the bridge of boats.52 BAG respectable loftiness in the line of buildings that overhang the stream on its left bank which imparts an interesting variety to the view. The right or western bank is by no means so picturesque in its architecture, but its large groves of date-trees mingled with other buildings render it also a pleasing object from the more populous side. The bazaars of Baghdad are on the whole disappointing: it is not their want of extent, for they are large enough, nor is there a lack of traffic, for they are generally filled with gay and varied crowd; but there is in their construction a poverty of design and meanness of execution, and an appearance of dilapidation, which doubtless is in part attributable to recent misfor tunes, but much of which is matter of original defect. Some, and amongst them a very extensive triple and quadruple range, the work of the late Daud Pasha, are well built of fire-baked brick and mortar and shaded from the sun by lofty arcaded roofs of the same materials; but others are very ruinous and their roofs are formed merely of beams of wood irregularly and temporarily placed, and covered with date-tree branches or thatch of reeds. The shops themselves are poor and frequently in disrepair; many are unoccupied; and there is in most places to be seen that air of neglect and reckless squalidity which so strongly indicates a tendency to general decay. There are in various parts of the town several open spaces where particu lar sorts of goods are sold, and which have taken their respective appella tions therefrom; as the 'Thread Market/' the 'Muslin Market/' the ' Corn Market/' &amp;c. Of these the largest and the gayest is that close to the northwest, or Musal gate; but none of them have any pretensions to splendour, or even to cleanliness. The last-mentioned is, in fact, the great ' place ' of the city. Horses are here exposed for sale; it is surrounded by coffee-houses, which are constantly filled with an assemblage of all sorts of people, smoking, drinking coffee, &amp;c., and it is the general place of exhibi tion, and of execution too, for here criminals are punished with decapitation, hanging, or mutilation; and sometimes passers-by are greeted by the sight of a headless trunk or two, exposed for the day, as a warning to evil-doers. The interior of the town, remarks another authority (Buckingham), offers fewer objects of interest than one would expect from the celebrity which its name has obtained as an oriental emporium of wealth and magnificence. A large portion of the ground included within its walls is unoccupied by buildings, particularly on the north-eastern side; and even where edifices abound, particularly in the more populous quarters of the city, near the river, a profusion of trees are seen, so that, viewing the whole from the terrace oi any of the houses within the walls, it appears to be a city rising from amid a grove of palms, or, like what Babylon is supposed to have been, a walled province rather than a single town. All the buildings, both public and private, are constructed of furnace- bumed luicks of a yellowish-red colour, small size, and such rounded corners as proved most of them to have been used repeatedly before being taken, perhaps, from the ruins of one edifice to construct a second, and from the a en fragments of that to compose a third. In the few instances where e )ricks are new, they have an appearance of cleanliness and neatness never presented by the old, though even those are still much inferior to stone. e s ree s of Baghdad, as in all other Eastern towns, are narrow and unpaved, ant en sides present generally two blank walls, windows being rarely seen opening on the public thoroughfare, while the doors of entrance,53 BAG leading- to the dwellings from thence, are small and mean. These streets are more intricate and winding than in many of the great towns of Turkey, and with the exception of some tolerably regular lines of bazaars and a few open squares the interior of Baghdad is a labyrinth of alleys and passages. The mosques are here built in a different style from those seen in most other parts of Turkey. The most ancient is thought to be that called ' Jama-al-Snkh-i•.Garzel/ , or the mosque of the cotton-thread market; but little remains of this beyond a thick heavy minaret and part of the outer walls. Of the private houses of Baghdad, but little is to be seen excepting their exterior walls and terraces. Throughout the whole of this large city not one pointed arch in the doorway to any private dwelling is to be seen. They are all round or flat, having a fancy work of small brick above them; and even in those parts of the old bazaars and ruined mosques in which the pointed arch is seen, its form is nearer to the Gothic than to the common Saracenic shape, so that Baghdad could not have been the original seat of Saracenic architecture, which probably took its rise much further in the west. The houses consist of ranges of apartments opening into a square or inner court; and while subterraneous rooms, called ' sardabs/' are occupied during the day for the sake of shelter from the intense heat, the open terraces are used for the evening meal and for sleeping on at night. Baghdad contains a population of 60,000 souls, or 15,000 families, divided thus: Turks or of Turkish descent, 4,000 families; Persians, 2,500; Jews, 2,500; Christians, 1,000; Kurds, 1,000; Arabs, 2,000; Nomad Arabs, 2,000. The Turks occupy the north quarter of the city, while over the rest are dispersed the mercantile classes of Mahamadans, the Christians and Jews having separate quarters on the central parts of the town. Besides there are a number of Bedouins who do not like to pass the night in the town, and a great number of Persians who either repair to Kazamin, a village four miles off, on the right bank of the river, or encamp without the walls on the north side of the city. Though the costumes met with in Baghdad are far less splendid than those of Cairo or Constantinople, still there is something of a glittering stir, for both Turkish and Arabs are fond of red in all its shades and of other gay colours, and their furs and embroidery, and shawled turbans and flowing garments, with the silver-hilted daggers and pistols at their waists, make up a lively and pleasing picture. Riding through the bazaars is, however, a service of some danger. Though forming the common thoroughfares, they are so narrow that one is constantly stopped by trains of loaded camels or mules, the packages on whose backs are apt to break either one's head or knees, according to the height of the passing quadruped; and there is enough to do in steering one's course between them and the crowd of ruffian-like Arabs that beset every street and passage. Among the things which strike a stranger is the imperturbable stillness and apathy, as it seems, with which the Turkish merchant sits on the raised platform at his door, smoking his pipe in the midst of the bustle around him, as if he heard it not or had nothing of a trader's interest in the sale of his wares. If a customer approach, he slowly and silently displays the goods required, and serves him if they suit; if not, he smokes on. A Persian would have asked you a dozen times what you wanted, showed you fifty54 BAG things successively that you did not want, and jumped from his seat and sat down upon it again as many times, while the grave indifferent Turk is taking his 'chibouk' from his mouth to speak to you. It must be owned, however, that the Jew and Armenian dealers compensate by their quickness and volubility for the torpor of the Turks; they are active enough, in all conscience, in ascertaining and supplying the wants of their customers. Another remarkable feature to a stranger in the streets and bazaars of Baghdad is the multitude of Arabs, both Bedouins and residents in the city, scowering along on their little blood steeds, their clothes flying wide in the wind and their long spears shaking over their shoulders. Even in the city one is apt to regard them as dangerous persons to encounter, as they brush along with an air of fierce independence; for the Arab com ports himself everywhere as lord of the soil, and, in fact, he is here very nearly, if not absolutely so. Then their shouting and their roaring as they go along might lead one to believe they were about to plunder every one they meet, for the Arab never talks except at the top of his voice; and so deafening is that voice that strangers are apt to suppose they are quarrelling, when, in fact, they are merely conversing or relating some trivial occurrence. But it is not the Arabs alone that habitually make this clamour; it is general in Baghdad, which of all places is the most remarkable for every imaginable sort of noise, and its inhabitants the most intolerably obstreperous. ^Fraser thus describes a day in Baghdad a The room I now occupy has a balcony over the street, with two windows, so that everything that passes under is as well heard as if it were going on in the room. ^Before day I have a concert of cocks and hens from a neighbouring yard; this is followed by the lively- beat of the ' reveillez ' from the sepoys' quarter, which, in its turn, rouses a host of dogs; these keep up a very industrious running base of barking till the donkeys begin to bray. By that time the neighbouring Arab?, who have been driven into town by the disturbed state of the country beyond its walls, have shaken their ears, and begin to drive out to pasture the flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and camels they have brought in with them for security. Assuredly Arab sheep and cattle have the deafest ears to the voice of the charmer of any animals on earth, or they are grievously abused by their drivers, for such a routing and roaring as is made to induce the beasts to move along I never heard in any other place, nor could one imagine that so extraordinary a variety of guttural sounds could be uttered by the lungs of man. Flock after flock, herd after herd, are to be heard approaching from afar; the uproar swells upon the ears, dinning and confounding them till drums of the said organs are well nigh cracking; and just when it begins to retreat, and you are venting a silent expression of thankfulness for the relief, another burst of vociferation arises in the distance, so that the same torture continues generally for two hours. By that time the rest of the biped inhabitants are astir. The quiet Turk shuffles silently along, nor do the Christians or Jews commit any violent trespass upon the sense of hearing; but there are more Arabs, ay, this street is their great throughfare, and here and everywhere they rush along in droves, like the less brutal animals they drive or ride, hallooing to each other and to all they pass, often maintaining a conversation at the top of their tre mendous voice, with some equally clear-piped brother, at a quarter of a mile s distance : as for approaching nearer for convenience of communication,55 BAG they never dream of such a thing-; lungs are cheaper than legs, it is clear, at least in Baghdad. Then there is—but I spare you the further detail of town—criers—saints routing out their pealing ejaculations, beggars and fakeers thundering forth their petitions in the name of Allah and the Prophet, and, worse than all, professed singers practising their voices as they pass along. In short, Hatchett's in Piccadilly, when the mails and coaches are under despatch, Cockspur Street and Charing Cross, when the season is fullest and the cries are loudest, or Sniithfield on a special market- day, or Billingsgate, or all of these together, must strike and yield the palm for variety and intensity of noise to Baghdad, the true legitimate successor of old Babel!' Notwithstanding the apparent seclusion in which women live here, and indeed through the whole Turkish Empire, there is no want of real liberty, which sometimes, as in other places, is sufficiently abused; nor can it be denied that the facility of clandestine meetings is much greater in Turkish cities between persons of the country than in any European metropolis. The disguise of a Turkish or Arab female in her walking dress is 00 complete, that her husband himself could not recognize her beneath it; and conse quently, let a lady go where she will, no suspicion of the truth can attach to any individual. Among the women of Baghdad, the Georgians and Circassians are decidedly the handsomest by nature and the least disfigured by art. The high-born natives of the place are of fresh and clear complexion, while the middling and inferior orders, having brown skins and nothing agreeable in their counte nances, except a dark and expressive eye, are sometimes so barbarously tattooed as to have the most forbidding appearance. With all ranks and classes the hair is stained with henna, and the palms of the hands are so deeply dyed with it as to resemble those of a sailor covered with tar. Those only who by blood or habits of long intercourse are allied to the Arab race use the blue stains so common amongf the Bedouins of the desert. The passion for this method of adorning the body is carried in some instances as far as among the ancient Britons, for besides the staining of the lips with that deadly hue, anklets are marked round the legs, with lines extending upwards from the ankle, at equal distance to the calf of the legs; a wreath of blue flowers is made to encircle each breast, with a chain of the same pattern hanging perpendicularly between them; and among some of the most deter mined belles, a zone or girdle of the same composition is made to encircle the smallest part of the waist, imprinted indelibly upon the skin. There are artists in Baghdad whose profession it is to decorate the ladies with wreaths, &amp;c., of the newest fashions.' Amongst the objects which next to the number of wild-looking Arabs are apt to arrest the observation of a stranger in his walks through Baghdad, the multitude of white asses and intensely black and exquisitely ugly negro slaves that swarm in all the streets and bazaars may fairly be placed. For the former there is quite a craze here; white is your only colour for a donkey, and you scarcely meet any person of respectability, man or woman, mounted on anything else than these spotless quadrupeds, except, indeed, the more warlike classes, who despise anything under the grade of an Arab steed. Most of the learned and holy professions prefer the meeker animal, and so do all the ladies, so that the number in56 BAG use is very great; and as women of the higher ranks seldom move without a multitude of attendants similarly mounted, when such a visit is made at the house of a neighbour, the braying concert becomes intolerable. These asses are, I believe, of a particular breed, and fetch very high prices, from forty to fifty pounds sterling, being no uncommon sum for one of great size, good blood, and fine paces. They are magnificently caparisoned, and every one of the poor animals has its nostrils slit, a practice prevalent also in Persia, and which is said to make them longer-winded. The rage for black slaves here is quite as universal as that for white donkeys, and, judging from appearances, it seems that the uglier they are the more they are valued. These dark beauties, male and female, come chiefly from Madagascar and Zanzibar, and are supplied for the most part by the Imam of Muscat, in whose hands nearly all of the trade rests. They are all thick-lipped, have broad faces, high cheek-bones, exceedingly depressed noses, small-peaked chins, staring white eyes, and atrociously black skins. Here they are greatly preferred to all others as servants, both in the Harem and for other offices. The streets swarm with them, and their glossy skins, fat shining faces and gay apparel lead at once to the conclusion that they fare well,—a fact sufficiently notorious from the well-known partiality of Turks, in common with most Orientals, towards their slaves; and the impu dent swagger, and not unfrequently insolent language of the dark rogues as they pass you in the street, leaves no doubt of their being the spoiled favourites of some over-indulgent master. The climate of Baghdad, generally speaking, may be deemed a healthy one. It is true that in periods of anarchy and mal-administration, when the neglected dikes admit of the water inundating the country, epidemics prevail during the season of the greatest heat, from May to October. These, however, yield readily to the usual remedies, and those who are dis creet, by taking medicine in time, may generally avoid attack alto gether, and there is no denying but that neglect renders these epidemic fevers malignant and fatal. The great heats are at times almost insupport able, and yet experience has shown the least sickness prevails in the hotter summers; while, on the other hand, sickness is rife when the heat from the barren soil is tempered by the presence of inundations, which, indeed, give rise to the infecting miasma. From October to May there is perhaps no finer climate in the world : cold, yet mild and invigorating, it cannot be excelled. This description of the climate does not extend to the lower country beyond one hundred miles south of the city. The fevers prevailing in the summers of that region are fatal in a high degree. The thermometer usually stands in the winter about 60°, but in the mornings may be seen as low as 20°, when the air is keen and much felt by natives of India, who, as pilgrims here, are for the most part but lightly clothed. In the summer it ranges from 90° to 117°, but this latter standard is rare; usually at the hottest time of day it is about 107°. The barometer at this time averages 29° 56 , while in the winter, except when south winds prevail, it remains at 30 10 . South winds are very oppressive and are usually accompanied by much dust. They last generally three days, terminate in squalls and rain, and are succeeded by fresh north-westers, with a brilliant sky and an atmosphere as deliciously pure as it is exhilarating.nriK——wwrmiwT' BaG The following copy of the register of the thermometer kept in the cabin of the Steamer Euphrates in 1840 will be useful here:— Maximum.

Some conception of it may be formed when it is mentioned that from April to October the natives are obliged, during the heat of the day, to take refuge in cellars underground, and at night to ^leep on the roofs of their houses, the rooms of the house during that period being uninhabitable. The thermometer generally rises to 115° in a shady verandah, and sometimes goes as high as 120° in the middle of the day, and 110° at ten at night, when we suffered much inconvenience from a burning hot wind, smelling strong of sulphur.' Baghdad is said to be attacked by the plague every ten years. In 1831 there was a very calamitous attack in which a very large number died of it. The bridge of boats which connects the two portions of the town is con structed of trunks of palm trees loosely laid side by side in a very careless manner and kept in wretched repair. It is not safe to cross it, for/notwith standing its extreme narrowness, so great a crowd of horses, camels, and asses is always on it that foot passengers are often thrust into the river.

Baghdad is a place of great trade, and the resort of merchants from almost every quarter of the east. It supplies all Asia Minor, Syria and part of Europe with Indian commodities, which are imported at Basrah, brought in boats up the Tigris, and then transported by caravans to Tocat, Constantinople, Aleppo, Damascus, and the western parts of Persia. The chief imports from India are gold brocade, cloths, sugar, pepper, tin, sandal-wood, iron, China-ware, spices, cutlery, arms, and broad-cloth; in return for which they send bullion, copper, gall-nuts, tamarisk, leather, and otto of roses. From Aleppo are imported European silk stuffs, broad-cloth, steel, cochineal, gold-thread, and several other European articles, which are brought in great vessels to Scanderoon. The imports from Persia are shawls, carpets, silk, cotton, white cloth, leather, and saffron; and those from Constantinople are bullion, furs, gold, and silver-thread, jewels, brocade, velvets, and otto of roses. The principal manufacture at this place is that of red and yellow leather, which is much esteemed, but silk and cotton stuffs are likewise made. Baghdad is sometimes called Dar-as-Salam, or 'abode of peace,' and also Medineht-al-Khalifa or 'City of Kalifs.' {Jones—Chesney—Kinnier— Fraser and Fontanier.) BAGHDAD.—Lat. 30°to36° Long. 42 o 30 / to 47° Elev. A Pashalic of Turkey, boundaries of which as given by various authorities differ considerably. Kinneir says it is bounded by the Euphrates and desert of Nejid in the south and west by Ktlzistan and Mount Zagros to the east, by the Pashalic of Diarbakr to the North-West, and Armenia with territories of the Chief of Julamerik to the north. Chesney says it extends from Lat. 30° to 37 0 31 / 5; /, Long. 38 o 7 , 10 // to 48 0 45 , 16/ / ' including Anah, Rahabah, Mardln, Miisal, Arbel, Koh, Sanjak, Karktik TakrI, Sulimania, Zobals, and Khanikln. Both these authorities make it out to be very much more extensive than Jones, who defines the limits of the Pashalic as extending from the north shores of the Persian Gulf along the Euphrates River as up as Anah. Thence a line drawn across Mesopotamia to the Hamrin range of hills and led east so as to include the province of SulimSnia in Kurdis tan bounds it to the north, its east limit being then defined by the line of the Shirwan and Diala Rivers as far as KhanikTn, whence it skirts the foot of the Zagros, including the great plains as far as the Kerkha River wesfr of Hawiza and thence to the angle formed by the meeting of the Shatt ul Arab and Mahamrah streams. Jones is certainly the latest authority, and must for the present be considered the best. The Pashalic, therefore, extends as above. Its length from south-east to north-west is 500 miles, and its breadth 250 miles. Its area in square miles is, says Jones, 50,000. The divisions of the Pashalic within the above limits are, (1.) A1 Jazira, or the portion to the north-west between the Euphrates and the Tigris; (2.) Irak Arabi, or that below Baghdad and south of the Tigris; and (3.) Sulimania or the country of the Kurds under the Governor of this province. The first two of these are arbitrary divisions, the last an administrative division.BAG Besides these, the Pashalie is divided among roving- tribes of Arabs who nevertheless keep pretty much to their bounds, as the Montefik between Semaweh and Busrah extending- to the Tigris south-west of the Hye and south of the Hud Rivers, the Beni Lam who occupy the tract east of the Tigris from Kut al-Amareh to the Hud River and the Mesopotamia!! side of the Tigris south-east of the Hye; the Zobeid who range between the Tigris and Euphrates north of the Hye as far as the Suklawieh Canal to the west-north-west of Baghdad, and the Shammar Togeh and DefPabeh having their habitat in the great plains east of the Tigris and south of the Diala as far south as Kut al-Amareh. The general aspect of the whole of this country is that of a dead level plain of a sandy clay abounding with worm-wood, and wherever there is no water being a positive desert. But between Baghdad and the Euphrates and near the two rivers the surface is occupied by salt and lakes and marshes, and wherever it is watered it becomes rich and productive in the extreme. There are no mountains or hills of any kind throughout the extent of the Pashalic, that is, if we exclude from consideration the Sulimania division, which is better described separately. The rivers of Baghdad are the Tigris, Euphrates, Zab, Adheym Diala, Tharthar, Shat al Hai; all described elsewhere. There are several large and important canals in the Pashalic, viz., Sukla- wiah, Shat al Hai, etc., etc. The lakes of the Pashalic are those of Akarkuf, of Birs Nimrud and Lemlum. There are besides several marshes and extensive sheets of water that are met with during the floods both above and below Kornah. The climate of the Pashalic of Baghdad in the summer is extremely hot and trying, and in the south portion it is very unhealthy, the sun going up to 117 in the shade. In the upper portion the winter is cold and bracing, and cold winds blow over the desert which are rather trying. Rain generally falls at the beginning of the year. I have little information of the mineralogy of Baghdad; the north part is said to produce copper and lead, and the south, salt, lime, bitumen, and naptha. The domestic animals are camels, buffaloes, sheep, horses, goats, all of superior kind, but the cows and oxen are of an inferior breed. Of wild animals, jackals are found in large troops; lions and hyenas are not so numerous; hares are abundant. Black and grey partridge, francolins, Brahmini and common wild geese, ducks, teals, pelicans, and cranes are abundant, and the flamingo, spoonbill, paddy-bird, crow, owl, curlew, rock- pigeon, kingfisher, snipe, cormorant, and various kinds of hawk are found. Though the horse is the most valuable animal, the most common and most useful animal in the province is the camel. They are universally of the dromedary class, having but a single hump, and are of different colours, brown, white, and a lead colour, but the former is by much the most prevalent. The usual travelling pace of those which cany burthens is remarkably slow, seldom exceeding a mile and three-quarters, or two miles an hour. Those, however, which are used as riding camels will move much quicker, and they have been known to go from Baghdad to Aleppo, a distance of nearly seven hundred miles, in the course of eight or nine days. They feed when they travel on a salt prickly weed in the desert, called ' shtitar khar' (the camels' thorn), which, with a small quantity of flour and water kneaded together into a ball, and give them morning and evening, constitutes the 65 I66 BAG whole of the nourishment which they receive during the journey. Their speed is at no time equal to the gallop of a horse; and their trot is so exces sively rough, that it is next to impossible for a person, not in the habit of riding them, to keep his seat. Mules and asses are also used as beasts of burthen; the latter are small, and the former are principally brought from Persia. Buffaloes are kept for the sake of the milk, and oxen are used for the purposes of agriculture. With the exception of Baghdad and Basrah there is scarcely a fixed abode deserving the name of a town, though Kornah, Semaweh, Hilleh, Musseyb, Hit, Anah, Takrit, Samara, Sulimania, Khanakin, Mendalli, Badrai Jessan are designated with that title. These are, however, the principal spots where communities of men in this province dwell within walls, though there are other villages and petty hamlets of mud construction on the Tigris and its tributaries north of Baghdad as well as on the line of the Euphrates south of Hilleh. On the course of the Tigris, with its arms south of the capital, if we except the miserable hamlet called Beled al Hai, on the Hai River, there is not a fixed abode. These great plains in fact are the wandering places of the nomades, whose various tribes give so much trouble to the Government and may be said to exist regardless of all laws, but those which are conventional among themselves. These tribes are all Arabs and of them the Montefik is the most powerful; the others are the Beni Lam, Shammar, Deffafeh, Daour, Zobeid, Baid, Arfuyd, Amareh, As Seraj, Dellim, Dijed, Abeyd, &amp;c., &amp;c. These will be found described elsewhere. The inhabitants of the Pashalic besides the Arabs consist of Csmanli Turks, Kiirds, Turkmans, Syrians, Jews, and Christians and are said to number 13,00,000. Arabic is the general language, Turkish, Kurdish, Chaldl, Syriac, and the Syro-Chaldean dialects being the exceptions. The Sunl Mahamadan religion is prevalent. Jones remarks—' On the whole, it may be said that the population is a quiet one. There is little appearance of fanaticism in it. The Jew and the Christian are tolerated, and enjoy immunities which they do not elsewhere possess. The only tax upon them is the ' kharaj/ or capitation tax, levied annually on males only above the age of 15 in the proportion of about 10, 5, and 2^ shillings per head. This exempts them from all other demands, and while the poor Mahamadan is often dragged from his wife and children, and made to serve as a soldier, these classes pursue their occupation in quiet in the midst of their families, and yet are not contented. The Christians and Jews of Turkey nevertheless, while they are insidiously robbing all classes of their neighbours, are ever ready to whine about oppressions, and unfortunately they receive attention from those who are ignorant of their characters and real position in Turkey. The fact is that there is more real ill-will felt towards Jews in Europe than at the present time in Turkey, and the concealed hatred of Roman Catholics and Protestants manifests itself more in those civilized States than it now does in the dominions of the Sultan. We have nothing to compare among Maha- madans with the Spanish denial of sepulture to their fellow Christians. Here every sect of Christians has its churches and cemeteries, and the intercourse between individuals of totally different, creeds in the common concerns of life is less restricted and infinitely more courteous than among those professing Christianity under different denominations in Europe. Massacre in this country, solely on account of antagonistic belief, is a rare67 BAG thing, and when it docs occur it arises more from its being- the first politi cal weapon at hand on the part of the rebellious townspeople against the Government than from any inherent desire to shed Christian blood, and in some cases it has been brought about by the Christian parties themselves being urged to set at defiance the restrictions they had lived under in peace, if not in absolute freedom.' The soil of this province is generally a sandy clay, the surface of which in the absence of water is a positive desert, but wherever it is watered by the numerous inlets and irrigating canals branching from the different rivers it is rich and productive in the extreme. The agricultural products are tobacco, Indian-corn, wheat, barley, cotton. Of fruits there are grapes, melons, apricots, figs, cherries, pomegranates, quinces, pears, dates, all of which are abundant where the least care is taken to cultivate them. Onions, spinach, and beans are the usual vegetables, and these are largely cultivated along the sides of the rivers, where just, after the water recedes, the progress of vegetation is surprising. Some idea may be formed of the productive qualities of the soil from the fact of eight crops of clover having been cut in the neighbourhood of Basrah during one year. I 1 he prevailing trees are the sycamore, the silver poplar, with the tamarisk and liquorice plants, both of which are everywhere abundant. Truffles, wild capers, peas, and the ceratonia siligna (carrot) are also found. The most productive parts of the Pashalic are on the banks of the Shat- al Arab in the neighbourhood of Basrah, and for 30 miles below that city, which yields vast quantities of dates, wheat, barley and various kinds of fruit. The borders of the Euphrates also between Kornah and Shukashu produce abundance of dry grain, the country of the Alghazyl Arab between Lemlum and Samarat is famed for its plentiful crops of rice. The dates grown in the districts on the lower part of the Euphrates are said to excel even those of Tafilah on the banks of the Nile, and of all the pro ductions of Baghdad it is the most beneficial. The cultivation of this tree is conducted with great attention; and as the process is somewhat remark able, 1 shall give the following short account of it from Kinneir. Both the male and the female begin to blossom towards the end of February. The flower grows from the stem, between the uppermost branches (or leaves), and is in appearance something like a bunch of wheat, but much more white. The flower of the male tree is sweet and palatable, but that of the female bitter and nauseous to the taste. About the middle of March, when the trees are completely in flower, they are pruned of all their exuberant branches; and it is sometimes deemed advisable to remove a certain quantity of the blossom and stalk of the male flower, which is then inserted into a small incision made in the top of the female tree. After the application of the male flower, the dates of the female gradually increase in size, until the khormeepuz, or date ripening, which is in August and September. A male is sufficient to fecundate many hundred females; and it is even said that the same portion will, in case of necessity, answer for several. The male flower never produces fruit, and is eaten by Arabs as bread, either green or roasted. When ripe the dates are pulled, and appropriated agree- ably to the views of the owner. Some are dried in the sun, and strung on lines made of goats' hair. Those that are intended to be kept in a moist state are immediately packed up in baskets made of the palm leaf, and the saccharine matter which they contain is found sufficient to preserve them68 BAG from spoiling. The inhabitants of these countries look upon the date tree as the greatest blessing they enjoy; it yields food for men, horses, and dogs, and may be applied, it is said, to three hundred and sixty different uses. The whole of the Pashalic is celebrated for the excellency of its pasture land which support large numbers of cattle, &amp;c., belonging to the Arabs. The chief manufactures of the province are slippers, shoes, boots, some silks, coarse cottons, the abbas or cloak universally worn by the Arabs, the gaily striped kerchief of silk and cotton mixed, which is invariably used to cover their heads, and the coarse black tent which forms the dwelling place of a large proportion of the people throughout the year. To these manu factures may be added some elegant embroidery on cloth and leather with other ornamental work of a like nature. A great number of sawyers and carpenters are occupied in preparing timber and in the construction of edifices and furniture of that material, and a still greater number of artizans are employed in making or repamng- the ordinary culinary utensils of copper and tin. To these may be added a limited number of individuals who find occupation as gold and silversmiths in the bazaars of the principal towns and making seals, rings, and more ordinary ornaments for women. The trade of Baghdad is represented as very considerable, all centering in the capital. Fleets of large well-built boats descend and ascend the Tigris with cargoes to and from the Persian Gulf, but the mass of the trade is carried on by caravans, which branch in different directions from the capital. From Persia and Kurdistan are brought silk, coarse woollens, shawls, and carpets of Kashmir, Kirman, Yezd, stuffs, gum rahabat, fur-skins, tobacco, rose-water, galls, dyes, &amp;c; from Turkey soap, cotton, linen, silks, embroidered muslins, opium, copper, and stuffs; from Arabia incense, myrrh, galbanum, raisins, gums, drugs, and coffee; from Europe, Egypt, &amp;c., greycloths, prints, calicoes, longcloths, sheetings, twists, hardware, and cutlery, all English; also fine French and German cloths, cutlery, lead, tin. West India coffee, indigo, cochineal, velvet and satin stuffs, and drugs and spices. The exports are wheat, barley, rice, and other grains, horses, pearls, corals, honey, dates, cotton, silk, tobacco, gallnuts, wool, bitumen, naptha, sulphur, saltpetre, salt, coarse coloured cottons, fine handkerchiefs, and other manu factures. Imports are charged five per cent, and amount to three per cent, only when the goods are in course of transit from other places. Exports are charged from nine to 12 per cent. They have been % arranged by tariffs and special treaties which the authorities at Baghdad and Basrah have always respected. The communications of Baghdad with the south are generally carried on by water. These will be found described in the articles on Euphrates, Tigris, &amp;c. Those by land to places round it are as follows. The number of days given for each journey however vary according to such circumstances as deficient means of transit over swollen streams and disturbances to the country, &amp;c. From Baghdad to Musal by Kerkuk occupies 12 days, not including stoppages, to Tehran by Kirmanshah 18 days, to Sulimania 7, to Khana- kin 4, to Damascus 30, to Hileh 2, to Basrah 14, to Anah 7, to Hit 4, to Samara 4, to Badrai 5, to Shustar 12. These routes with others will be found described in the Table of Routes. The form of Government in Baghdad and the minor towns is based on that of Constantinople, varied only to suit local usages and requirements,69 BAG when these do not operate badly on the general land which is that of the Koran and the interpretations which learned legislators have awarded to its less intelligible doctrines. The old despotic rule has been closed for some years; and now a Council, at which the Pasha usually presides, hears and determines upon all cases. It is a mixed one of IVIahamadans and Christians, though the latter are not sufficiently independent to do justice to their position when the Mahamadan portion may be biassed by their creed or by corruption to pronounce an unjust award. Though nefarious practices in perversion of land and right are less complained of in Baghdad than in most parts of the Turkish Empire, there are very many faults in its admi nistration. The Pasha is too poor to maintain an efficient staff in the various departments, and the fiscal arrangements of the province as well as the police of the towns are on the most slender and inadequate scale. Frequent and daring robberies, as well as loss of revenue, result from want of force to-levy the one, and the absence of efficient means to check the commission of the other. There is in fact no system, and as long as governorships, public lands, custom dues, and the wholesale sending of many staple articles of commerce and food are held as monopolies by the highest bidders in the State auction, improvement cannot be expected. Every one of course works these with the greatest gain and least loss to himself, regardless of the effects on individuals and the hideous consequences to the State. The regular Army too in the province is far too small for its extent in the most peaceable times; indeed should a serious emeute arise in Baghdad itself, the whole force would barely suffice to put it down; and when the lawless character of the tribes around is considered, it is a wonder indeed that such a patch-work and threadbare form of Government can hold together at all. The secret lies however in the opposite elements of the governed body and the character of the general mind being too slow to work mischief, a love of repose and a singular apathy in these people to past, present, or future events adds to the security while it acts in an inverse ratio when we think of the energy necessary to effect improvement. The revenue of the Pashalic is derived from a tax on transit goods, produc ing as follows:— Naptha 8^ millions dollars; from dates, cotton, house rent, &amp;c., 1^ millions; from wheat, barley, and other grains, exclusive of the produce of the lands farmed chiefly near Baghdad and Hillah four millions; and from the proportion taken by the Pasha being one-tenth of the animals reared 8^ millions; total 12^ millions dollars. As the inferior establishments at Anah, Hit, Hillah, and Kornah are chiefly maintained by local contributions, the disbursements are confined almost exclusively to Baghdad itself. They consist of the expenses of the Pasha^s followers, presents, salaries of State officers, together with the maintenance of the troops organized after the European model and the fixed revenue paid to the Sultan. Besides these expenses considerable sums of money are privately distributed in order to secure the allegiance of some of the Shekhs, and subsidies are paid to all the Chiefs from whom any service is required. There is, however, in peace able times a considerable surplus, which however is consumed when the Arab tribes are called out. Fontanier, who states that the Pasha's accounts passed through his hands, estimates the annual revenue of the Pashalic at about £500,600. I have no information regarding the army of the Pasha of Baghdad. ( hesney70 BAG—BAH says that 5,000 semi-disciplined troops are maintained, and that 100,000 men could be assembled from the tribes provided due notice were given and the necessary payments to the Chiefs were previously made, yet I believe the army of the Pashalic is now in a very efficient state. (Jones— Chesney—Kinneir—Fraser.J BAGHDADIA.—Lat. Long. Elev. An old fort on the left bank of the Tigris, close to the ruins of Ctesiphon. It is one of the wooding stations for steamers. (Wray.) BAGH-IDRL—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Sinjar hills, province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, the resi dence of the temporal and spiritual head of the Yezdis. (Chesney.) BAHDINAN.—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Kurds who inhabit the valley of Amadia and the left bank of the Tigris from the junction of the Khabur River as far as Musal. The sub-divisions of this tribe are Sindi, Sleivani, Goli, Goyi, Artushi, Derran, Kaidi, Shekhan, Navkur, Bowat, Najukur, Kalati, Kala Deir, Seruji, Shirwan, Barados, Gerdi, Misuri, Berrawi, Doski, Kerki, Rekani, Nerwi, Berrawijur, Govi, Teli, Zitk, Sherm, Zobar. Their capital is Amadia, and the Chief of this place is the noblest, and is even looked upon as something saintly, deriving his origin from the caliphs; but from the ancient name of the family it dates possibly from a much more remote antiquity. No person dare use the same vessel or pipe as is used by the Prince of this family; not even his own pipe-bearer for the purpose of lighting or trying it for his master. His person is so sacred that, in the fiercest battle among tribes, their arms would fall from their hands if he approached them. Yet he has little or no power over the savage and war like clans who compose his people, and he receives nothing from the revenues of his own estates. Should he want a sum of money for any extraordinary exigency he mounts his mule and goes round to the Chiefs of the different clans, becoming a guest for a night with each of them, when, by the laws of hospitality, they cannot refuse his request; and in the morn ing when he departs the Chief with whom he has passed the night makes up a small sum as a voluntary offering to him. He affects the state of the latter Abasside Caliphs. He always sits alone. A servant brings in his dinner and then leaves him till he has finished it. After having eaten enough he smooths the dish over, that no one may see what part he has eaten. He then calls a single attendant, who removes the dinner, brings him the basin and ewer to wash, supplies him with a pipe, and then leaves him alone again. The Pasha is very well dressed, something in the fashion of Musal, with a Kashmir shawl on his head, wound round a red cap which hangs down behind, and is called a fess. When he holds a divan, first the Kiahya, or Prime Minister, enters and salutes the Pasha with an inclination of the body in the Persian manner, seating himself at a respectful distance. The Chief of the Meruri tribe next follows, and takes his seat by the side of the Kiahya; then the other resident Chiefs of clans, in the order of the rank of their clans. Pipes are then brought at the command of the Pasha. Only one servant is allowed to enter, who distri butes the pipes; and when the Pasha wishes the divan to break up, he orders eoffee. The Kahvaji, or coffee-maker, looks through the window, sees how many are present, fills as many cups with coffee, and arranges them on a tray which he brings in and hands in succession; after which71 BAH—BAI they all go away, except it please the Pasha to order any particular person, with whom he may have business, to stop. It seems the grandeur of the Bahdinan Prince to render himself as inaccessible and invisible as possible. The Bebbeh Chief, on the contrary, is expected to make himself as public as he can, and he has, indeed, seldom an hour to himself. Some of the Bahdinan Princes have even covered their heads with a veil whenever they rode out, that no profane eye might see their countenance; and this we learn from Benjamin of Tudela was the practice of the later Caliphs of Baghdad. The uniform of the Pasha's own officers and servants is a black jacket made of abba stuff, manufactured at Mvisal, with gold frogs. All wear the many coloured striped trowsers which are the supreme bonton in Amadia and Julamerik. The Pasha, when he goes a hunting, changes his dress at a hunting-box of his, near Amadia, for one of a mountaineer of lower rank, in which he clambers the cliffs and lies in wait for the wild goat, observing never to shoot one younger than four years. Their age is easily recognized by the practised eye, even at a distance, by their horns. This and snaring, shoot ing or hawking the red-legged partridge is the only sport in the territory of Amadia, which is too mountainous to admit of exercise on horseback. BAIATS— A tribe of Turkmans, who inhabit the plain of this name to the west of Kufri. The tribe was formerly more powerful, but when Nadar Shah invaded the country he swept away the Baiats to Khorasan, and those who remain are descended from the Chief's family. They can even now turn out 1,000 horsemen. They have also some Arabs and broken tribes under their protection. Their horses are much esteemed. The district they inhabit was given them as a gift by the Sultan, and they pay nothing to the Ottoman Government, only owing military service to the Province of Baghdad when he takes the field in person. [Rich.) BAIBCRT—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Province of Arzrnm, Asiatic Turkey, 82 miles west by north of Arzrum, on right bank of the Chorak River, about half-way between Arzrum and Tarablzun. It is irregular and ill-built, occupying the base of an insulated hill, on the summit of which is an ancient castle fortified by an outer wall which descends far down the hill. The outer encienie is in a dilapidated condition, but the inner wall of sand-stone is still entire and consists of an irregular line flanked by small angles, semi-circles, and here and there a bastion of diminutive dimensions. Of the interior defences, three square towers, one in the centre and one at each extremity of the fort, remain standing amidst a heap of ruined buildings. Round the town are situated in the banks of the river many picturesque gardens. The castle of Baiburt was one of the strongholds belonging to the Sovereigns of Armenia. The ruins, which cover a considerable extent of ground, display much beautiful masonry, while the numerous towers of all forms with which the walls were strengthened are remarkably well built. The fall of snow here in winter is so great as to interrupt communication with the neighbouring villages for months together, cow-dung baked in the sun being the only fuel of the poor classes. The inhabitants are described as a stout, active, hardy race, of mild and civil manners. Stuart says it72 BAI—BAK contains about 10,000 inhabitants, and that before the Russian war of 1828-29 it was much greater, they having- persuaded a great many families to emi grate with their army. In the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29 this place was surrendered to the Russians, who destroyed the fortifications, and on the 25th September 1829 the last battle of the war was fought here, in which the Turks were defeated. {Stwart—Monteith—Imperial Gazetteer.) BAIDAR WAND—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of the liaft Lang sept of the great clan of Bakhtiaris, who encamp in winter near the Diz (about 56 miles north of Shustar, in Kiizis- tan, Persia) on Shimbar, and Andakan, among the hills of Lali, and some times as far as Gotwand on the Karun. Their summer quarters are in the plains of Bazuft and Char Mahal. Jafar Kuli Khan, the Chief of this tribe, after the imprisonment of Mahamad Taki Khan by the Persians, raised his tribe to the chief place amongst all the Bakhtiaris, and at the time x Ir. Layard visited him he was able to raise about 700 horsemen and between 3,000 to 4,000 matchlockmen, but as his influence appears to rest entirelv on his personal prowess and success in plundering it does not always follow that the Baidar wand should be the leading tribe of Bakhtiaris, nor that the same number of men could always be raised by their Chief. (Layard) BAKIA CHAI.—Lat. Long Elev. A river of Ktardistan which joins the Bitlis Chai at the foot of Sir Sera, a high mountain forming part of the All Tagh rang-e. (Chesnev) BAKDBAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A large straggling village in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, 30 miles ast of Bah^dad, on the left bank of Diala. It contains a bazaar and a mosque and was formerly of great importance, being the point where several frequented roads met, but bloody wars and MusalmSn apathy have brought it to a state of decay from which there is little chance of its ever recovering. There are now not more than 700 to 800 houses. The town is surrounded by numerous gardens, in which the palm, orange, lemon, pome granate and mulberry trees flourish, and the immediate neighbourhood pro duces crops of all kinds of grain. The Diala River is crossed by a ferry half mile from the village. The village is watered by a cut from the Khorasan or Jalaleh Canal. [^Taylor—Jones—Fraser). BAKU—Lat. 40° 22' Long. 49° 51' Elev. A town in the district of Shirwan, Trans-Caucasia, Russia, or south shore of the Peninsula of Apsharon, on the west coast of the Caspian Sea, of which it is one of the most frequented ports. Ihe walls of the town were formerly Avashed by the Caspian, but they are at present five yards distant from it: the sea has how ever gained upon the land in other places, the ruins of ancient buildings being found at the depth of upwards of 18 feet. It stands in the centre of a small bay on a declivity the summit of which is crowned by the palace of the former Khans, is defended by a double wall and ditch constructed in the time of Peter the Great, and has two strong forts under whose pro tection vessels can anchor in from four to six fathoms of water, within 80 yards of the shore, in a spacious road sheltered from all quarters except the south, whose violence is also much sheltered by the intervention of two small islands. The only vessels however which are seen on it are the ugly Astra khan fishing boat and the black Persian merchantmen. The town is about one mile in circumference, is ill built, the streets narrow and crooked andBAK—BAL consists of a confused assemblag-e of grey-colored liouses, small, with flat roofs coated with naptha; its aspect is anything but cheerful. The houses are crowded within fortified walls: they have no windows looking to the street, and the entire back of the dwellings facing the court-yard and gardens consists of a close wooden lattice which shuts out any view, and in which are portions capable of being removed or pushed aside for the openings to serve as door or windows. The apartments of the women and domestics have windows without glass, no stone but occasionally an open hearth. The Virgin's tower is the most striking object in the place. There are, how ever, several spacious mosques, public squares, marts, and caravanseraies, a Greek and an Armenian Church, and some Tartar Schools. The chief exports of the town and neighbourhood are naptha, salt, and saffron, in return for which it receives chiefly from Persia raw silk, cotton, rich carpets, shawls, and rice, &amp;c., and from Europe all kinds of iron wares, cutlery, cotton, linen, and woollen manufactured goods, thus becoming an important entrepot through which an important trade is carried on between east and west. The adjacent island of Salian has important fisheries; population 7,431, chiefly Tartars with a few Armenians. The quantity of naptha procured in the plain to the south-east of the city is enormous. It is drawn from wells of which there are nearly 100, and some of which have been found by a computation to yield from 4,000 tons annually. These wells are in a certain degree inexhaustible as they are no sooner emptied than they again begin to fill and the naptha continues gradually to increase until it has attained its former level. There is a colony of Multan Hindus settled here, and they, with the Armenians, are accounted the principal merchants of the place. The district of Baku has but one permanent river, the Songast or Bielais. In the neighbourhood of Baku the soil is sandy and sterile, and on the mountains to the west it is likewise poor, yielding a scanty supply of grain. The following table taken from Abich's paper on the climatology of the Caucasus gives the following information of that of Baku :— Winter ... 36'45 ... Temperature 6'80o ... Rain and snow-fall. Spring ... 54-41 „ 0'640 „ Summer ... 77'99 „ 0*650 „ Autumn ... 63'52 „ S^SO „ Mean ... 58*03 11*545 Baku was surrendered to the Russian General Matuschkin after having been bombarded for some hours on the 7th August 1723, but it was afterwards restored. In ISOi, Prince Sesianoff, the Russian Governor of the Trans- Caucasian Provinces, entered into an intrigue by which he hoped to gain possession of this fortress, but attending a conference here for the purpose he was treacherously shot by the Governor. The inhabitants, however, subse quently opened their gates to the Russians. It was again attacked in 1828 by the Persians, but was saved by its garrison. The jurisdiction of Baku extends over 32 villages, with 19,000 inhabit ants, of whom 1,000 are Turkmans. Monteith mentions having sent in a plan and report of this place. [Ahlch—Malcolm—Kinneir—Monteith—Van Haxthausen—Chesney—Imperial Gazetteer?) BALBASI—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Kurdistan, composed of the following tribes:—(1) Kabaiz, the reigning family, consisting of about two hundred persons; (2) Manzur; 73 k74 BAL (3) Mamash ; (4) Piran ; (5) Rummook ; (6) Sinn and Taafah, who tog-ether make one tribe. The Chiefs of tribes are called Muzzin. Each Chief has a certain number of thieves, who rob for him, and his tribe makes him voluntary gifts of provisions. These are his only revenues. The price of blood among the Balbasis is twenty-two oxen; but it may be made up in other effects, to which often a nominal value is attached, more than twice the real amount, when the affair is to be compounded amicably. Their only laws are the usages of the tribe, and these are administered by the Chief, assisted by the Council of Elders. No crimes are punished with death bnt adultery, seduction, and such like. The Balbasis will not bestow a girl in marriage on a person of another tribe or people. They have courtship among them, and carrying off a girl by the lover is common. When a Chief dies he is succeeded by the best or bravest of his family, with the common consent of his tribe. If his eldest son is incapable, the best of the brothers succeeds. When a Chief is once nominated he cannot be deposed, and his authority is so well defined that there are no instances of a Chief ever having attempted to exceed them. In their own country the Balbasis do not willingly acknowledge any superior, either Turkish or Persian, but when they descend into the regions of Karatchuk (which they have not done for several years) they pay a tribute of sheep to the Bey. They are very fond of armour, and most of the principal people among them possess a complete suit of mail. The Balbasi Kiirds have a most curious way of curing wounds. They sew the wounded man in the skin of bullock fresh stripped off the animal leaving only his head out, and they leave him in it till the skin begins to putrefy. They say this never fails to cure the most desperate spear or sabre wounds. The Balbasis have among them a people of dependants or peasants, who have no voice in their affairs, and are considered as a very inferior caste. This people are found scattered all over Kurdistan, and are of no tribe or clan. The tribesmen call them Kelowspi or white caps, and also Guran. In the tribes which form the Balbass nation every man, even of the meanest rank, has a voice in public affairs. You may be settling business with Balbass Chiefs, and have come to an agreement with them, when on a sudden some common fellow will start up and say—' I do not agree to it!' and this is enough to spoil the whole affair in a moment. BALTKIS—Lat. Long. Elev. A large KtJrdish tribe, who inhabit a very strong and secluded country beyond the great range of Kendilan (in Kurdistan), which forms the pro longation of the Ushnai Mountains and bounds the plain of Lahigan. They number above 10,000 families, and their country contains perhaps 200 vil lages of which the Chief is Ragat. They are in a measure subject to the Mir of Rowandiz, to whom each family has to furnish one man for his army. Balik appears to be the name of the district which has been taken up by the inhabitants, refugees probably from the neighbouring clans ; and is now applied to designate this great independent tribe. They are described by Taylor as ' neither Moslems, Christians, nor real Kizzilbash.^ They swear by a church, and never by a mosque or the deity or any of the prophets. They are said to be the descendants of the early inhabitants of the mountains, who, according to them, had for their ancestors Sharezer or Sanaser as they call75 BAL—BAR him son of Sennacherib. Their formula of faith is ' Bon Zakhadan, bash questerdo Choklari, Saaldi gumana Bir zakhadan bash questerseyidee chokler Gelerdi imanah, which translated is—' A thousand ways he showed himself but many remained in doubt; if he should show himself in one way a great many would come to the faith/' the meaning of which is that they believe all the prophets were one and the same person, but that as Ali is the last who appeared, they attach more sanctity to his name than to Moses, or Christ, while Mahomed they ignore entirely.

It con tains about 709 square miles, and consists of a valley miles long enclosed by two chains of mountains. Shuragel lies south of these drains and has about 428 square miles of surface, which consists of plains w r ith mountains at intervals; and north is the plain of Lory, which is surrounded on all sides by mountains, and contains 1,650 square miles. Ihe soil, climate, and pio- ducts vary considerably, and the inhabitants consist of 2,008 lartais and Greek, and 21,668 Armenians, of whom 21,207 were transported from Arzrum and its vicinity after the Turkish war of 1829. In this district there is but one town, which is the central division of Shuragel on the banks of the Arpah chai, and contains 503 houses. There are 105 'ullages in which are 4,899 houses with a total population of 30,652 souls. BARDOS—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Kars, Asiatic Turkey, -30 miles south-south-west of Kars. It is curiously situated on and around a promontory at the loot ol which winds a small stream. Its summit is crowned with a f'oit now crumbling to pieces with age. The inhabitants are entirely Mahamadans, consisting of about 150 families, who have a bad reputation in the country. BAREM— Lat. Long. Elev. The part of the Talrus Range above Mardln, which separates the drainage of the West Tigris from that of the Khabur tributaries of the Euphrates, appears to be so called. Its elevation is not more than 2,300 leet, and it is of trap formation. (Chesney.) BARGIR KALA—Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in the Province of MtJsal, Asiatic Turkey, 18 miles north-east of Mnsal. It is situated under a range of hills, and has an extensive olive wood in front of it, the produce of which is put to the same use as that of Bazani (which see). It is inhabited by \ezds or Dassinis and Jacobites, who have a neat-looking church. There are also ten families of Mahamadans. It is situated just in front of a defile, where there is a spring which is an object of veneration to the Yezds, who repair to it in spring to the number of 2,000 to 3,000 men, women, and children, and offer sacrifices, play various martial games, and end by getting drunk.

It is a large village distributed round the base of a more conical hill than that of Julamerik and like it supporting a castle. _ It is said to contain 200 houses inhabited hy Kfirds, Jews, and Armenians. It is governed by an officer of the Beg of Julamerik, and is tributary to Pasha of Van. It was near this village that the distinguished antiquarian and traveller M. Schultz was murdered.

A town in the province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Shat-al-Arab river, 70 miles above its mouth, 40 miles below the junction of its two branches, 450 miles below Baghdad. 1 he town of Basrah, that is the inhabited area of the walls, is situated about 1 i mile from the right bank of the Shat-al-Arab, though the walls come nearly down to the bank of the river itself. The shape of the town is oblong, the short sides being west and east parallel to the river and the long north and south nearly at right angles to it. The length of the north side, which is not straight but curves inward to the south, is about 2^ miles, and of the south, which is nearly straight, about the same. The west side is also not straight out luns out into an angle about the middle and measures If mile as does the east, which is parallel with the river. Thus the whole circum ference of the space enclosed within the walls is not less than eight miles. But to say that the town of Basrah is eight miles in circumference would be giving a very enoneous impression of its size, for the greater portion is merely composed of gardens and date groves, and the real inhabited portion of the town occupies but a small triangular space, measuring f mile by f mile by 1 ? mile, and a sort of tail extending down the canal towards the river for | mile. The walls of Basrah are built of brick, but are in an extremely dilapi dated condition. I hey are built along the whole circumference with small buttresses of bastions projecting. Basrah has five gateways, viz., that of Zobaiaat the south-west angle, two towards the west and east end of the north face, one at the south-east angle leading on to the river, and the gate of Sarayah half mile east of 7677 BAS Zobaia. Besides these there is a built-up gateway about the centre of the south face. But thoug-h these are the actual gateways the principal means of ingress and egress to and from the town is by a canal which runs from the river right to the inhabited portion of the enclosure. This is defended by bastions at the entrance. Basrah is perhaps without exception the filthiest town in the east, the streets are exceedingly narrow, and the stench of the privies, which are every where exposed to view, is intolerable. The houses are meanly built, partly of sun-dried and partly of burnt brick, and the bazaars are miserable structures, not arched as in Baghdad and the cities of Persia, but covered with mats laid on rafters of date trees, which hardly afford any protection from the scorching rays of the sun. The town has ' Khans' without number, a great many coffee-houses, a few wretched baths, and upwards of forty mosques, of which however only one is worthy of the name. The number of houses is said to be 6,000, but this number is certainly not habitable. The Governor's residence is situated in the city on the bank of the canal and opposite the grain market, which is an open space about 200 yards square. Further up the canal is the French Consulate, and formerly the British Residency stood below the Custom-house, which is close to the east of the Governor's house. Below the old Residency is a caravanserai. On the bank of the river there is a small fort, the residence of the Capitan Pasha, in which the arsenal is placed. Kinneir estimated the number of inhabitants at 60,000, but now it is said not to reach more than 12,000, of whom not more than 300 or 400 are Turks, the rest being Arabs, Indians, Persians, Armenians, and Jews, the Arabs constituting the majority of the community. Almost every inhabitant of Basrah is engaged in trade in some way or another. Labour is, however, very expensive on account of the evil reputation of its climate, no stranger caring to risk the fever which is so prevelant, unless well remunerated. The town of Basrah would afford abundance of supplies of all sorts; the country round, besides rice, wheat, barley and five kinds of dates, yields various sorts of fruits and vegetables. Among the former are apricots, apples, figs, olives, pomegranates and grapes, and of the latter, cabbage, brocoli, lettuce, onions, peas, beans and truffles in vast quantities. Towards the month of November inconceivable swarms of fish enter the river, and swarms in every canal. These are caught and cured and sold for one shilling the hundred weight. For six months the natives live on nothing else; besides the supply of dates is practically unlimited. The trade of Basrah is very extensive and consists of the export of dates, salt, horses, and the import of rice and wood. It is said that upwards of 150 'buggalows' come annually to Basrah for cargoes of dates. These average about 60 tons each, and as their cargoes may be valued at about £400 the value of the date export trade would be about £60,000. Large quantities of corn from the neighbourhood of Suk-es-Shiok is brought here and re exported. There is also a very large number of horses exported annually to Bombay and also some to Calcutta. Basrah was formerly the centre of the commerce in pearls obtained by fishing at Bahrein and in the Gulf; these are, however, now mostly sent to Bombay direct. Colonel Pelly states that the total value of the goods, consisting of piece- goods, pepper, sugar, miscellaneous, imported into Basrah from Bombay78 13 AS amount to from £150,000 to £^00,000 annually. From Bag-lidad g-oods to the value of from £50,000 to £100,000 are received, while the total exports amount to £400,600. Basrah besides imports fruit and tobacco from Persia, indigo, sugar, spices, iron, English and Indian manufactures from various parts of the Indian Empire, and cofPee and slaves from the Red Sea. A very small part of these importations is consumed at Basrah; the rest is forwarded to Baghdad, whither dates and salt are also sent. All the trade operations of Basrah are undertaken at certain fixed times regulated by the season and the monsoon. The first dates are gathered in September and sent to the Red Sea, but as it is utterly impossible to enter that sea when the north wind prevails, vessels do not attempt to sail till after the end of January. No vessels depart for India until the south-west monsoon is nearly over, that is towards the month of October, and in case of a favourable passage two trips may be made in a season. Vessels enter ing the Red Sea are detained there until the month of May; meanwhile they dispose of their cargoes, and purchase new ones. They make but one voyage, which lasts about a year. Those which sail for Bombay take care to quit that port before the end of May, for fear of the south-west monsoon; and they return to Basrah in the middle of summer. In order to proceed to Baghdad, it is also requisite to watch for a favour able moment, that is to say, when the waters have attained a sufficient height; and this rise takes place about the month of June. The vessels which are to be loaded with merchandise then assemble and form a flotilla which is called car. When thus collected, the crew and the passengers may be estimated from one to two thousand, and consequently are enabled to defend themselves against the marauding Arabs. It is only by accompanying the car that travellers are able to go with perfect security from one town to the other, but a great deal of patience is required, as the voyage generally lasts 40 days. The flotilla starts three times a year at most, but its depar ture is always regulated by the arrival of ships from Bengal. Towards the close of the year indigo is gathered in India, at which period all the vessels of Basrah are at Bombay. The first produce of their mer chandise is remitted by Jewish or Mahamadan merchants to Calcutta for the purchase of indigo. These purchases are entrusted to agents in Bengal, who freight one or two ships, the Captains of which are almost always the same, and are accustomed to the Persian Gulf; and by these vessels the indigo is sent. They leave Bengal in February, and arrive at Basrah about June, after having touched at Muscat, Bandar Abbas, Bushahr, and Mahamra. Formerly Basrah manufactured large quantities of rose water, sweetmeats, and aniseed, which last was distilled in the town. The rose water of Basrah, for the preparation of which whole fields were set apart, long held a repu tation of pre-eminent excellence. But now scarcely any vestige of the manufacture remains. The sweetmeats were mostly made with the peal of bitter oranges, but pears, apples, and apricots were also preserved. The distillation of aniseed was principally carried on by Christians and Jews, but there is very little made of it now. The climate of Basrah is said to be extremely unhealthy, owing to the noxious miasma generated by the sun, the overflowing of the river, and the luxurious vegetation combined. The heat is excessive in the summer, the thermometer reaches as much as 120° in the shade. At this time all who can, desert the place, as it is very fatal to life and especially to Europeans.79 BAS—BAT All who cannot, take to their ' Sardabs,' a species of dark cellars under ground. But the great cause of its unhealthiness is the inundations of the river. These are not of long duration, and it is said that as long as the dyke along the river was kept in order they did not cause much harm, but since the repair has been discontinued the place has become more and more unhealthy, till now it is regarded as a veritable pest-house. The British Residency at Basrah is situated at the south of Ma J11, three miles above the town, on the right bank of the river. It is a large building with plenty of accommodation and some commissariat godowns, surrounded by a thick date grove. Basrah formerly belonged to the Arabs, but was conquered by the Turks in 1868, and since that time has witnessed many revolutions. After a siege of eight months, it was taken by the Persians, under Sadik Khan, in 1777. This Prince held it about a year, when aspiring to the throne of Persia, on the death of his brother, Karim Khan, he evacuated the city and retired with his troops to Shiraz, where he was shortly afterwards put to death. The Turks were again deprived of Basrah in 1787 by the Shekh of the Montefik Arabs: but the town was soon recovered by Suliman Pasha, who, in the October following, encountered the Shekh on the banks of the Euphrates, and put him to flight. The Musalim or Governor has ever since been sent from Baghdad, and is in general an officer of high rank. (Fontanier— Winchester—Felly— Wray—Klnneir.) BASTORAH CHAL—Lat. ' Long. Elev. A river of KQrdistan which joins the Zab River, near the village of Kasroki. {Chesney.) BATAN KOI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of the Aras, 40 miles east of that place. {Brant.) BATIL.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, on right bank of Bitlis Sfi, where it joins the Bohtan Su. It is situated on a mound on angles formed by the junction of the two rivers, and is built of stone from some old massive buildings in the centre of the mound, portions of which are seen protruding from the ground all round its base and for some way up the slope. [Taylor.) BATMAN SU.— Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Province Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the monntains of Darkush Tagh, in about latitude 38 0 45 / , longitude 41 0 1U / and formed from the lesser streams of the Kulp, Kanshan, and Sarum Sii, and flowing south five miles east of Miafarkeyn, falls into the Tigris opposite Zewa village. On the road between Miafarkeyn and Arzen it is crossed by a fine old bridge of a single arch, 40 feet high. The river is here easily fordable in October, being not more than three feet, but like all these streams is subject to considerable rises after rain in mountains. {Taylor.) BATNAIA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, situated to the north of Musal on the road to Alkosh. It is inhabited by Chaldeans. {Rich.) BATtM—Lat. 41° 39' Long. 41° 37' Elev. A seaport town in the Province of Kars, Asiatic Turkey, on the east shore of the Black Sea, and four miles north from the mouth of the Chorak River.80 BAT—BAY It is irregularly built, contains a bazaar situated on the west side of the bay close to the sea, about 60 shops, several coffee-houses. Khans and a mosque all built of wood. It can scarcely be said to possess a harbour, being- open to the north-west winds, but vessels lie close to the shore and disembark with greater facility than at any other part of the coast. Eastwick says it might hold some five ships, but is capable of improvement and enlargement towards the south-east. The roads to it from the interior are almost impassable, they either lead over the summits of the mountains which are covered with snow, or through thick forests among steep rocks, so that as a point in a line of communication the place is worthless and the climate is deadly to strangers. Brant says the east side of the bay opposite the bazaar is healthy and were it once placed on the rising ground there, it might be safely inhabited at all seasons, and would be beyond the influence of the marshes; since the breadth of the bay at that part is between two and three miles, now everybody is obliged to quit the place during the sickly season. The people appear in some respects to resemble the Georgians, but their language is different, and till within the last few years the authority of the Porte was merely nominal. The Lazi are considered the bravest infantry in Asia Minor, but are otherwise lawless banditti agitated by never-ending death- feuds. The doors and windows of their houses are musket-proof, but the town might easily be burnt, for the houses are surrounded by dry thorn hedges and many of the upper apartments are built of wood or even the branches of trees. A quantity of timber, particularly walnut and box, as well as honey and slaves, are exported to Constantinople. Vessels trading to Batum always keep a good look-out, and even take hostages for the security of their agents while transacting business. The country around is fertile in fruits, corn, and rice. The west side of the bay is considered unhealthy, espe cially from July to October, the east the reverse, having none of the marshy ground around it which is the source of the insalubrity of the other. Popu lation 2,500. The Russians were very anxious to retain this place on the peace of the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29, but Eastwick says they lost it by a quibble and a mistake in the spelling of a word. There is a Russian Vice-Consul here. {Brant—Monteith— JFagner—Eastwick.) BAVUN MIRDEH—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Kurdistan about 10 miles west of Sulimania. It is described as a large village. {Rich.) BAYAT—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the Tib, a tributary of the^Tigris. It is inhabited by Lurs and Beni Lam Arabs. {Layard.) BAYAZlD.—Lat. 39° 24' ' Long. 44° 20' Elev. A town in the province of same name, Asiatic Turkey, 140 miles south-east of Arzrnm, on the south-west of Ararat, from which it is separated by a plain of about 10 miles in width. The town is placed on a narrow sloping ridge which projects from a deep recess in these rocky precipices facing Ararat, and is crowned by the Pasha^s palace, a beautiful edifice of stone with two domes and a minaret, a strange contrast to the gloomy hovels below. The palace, one of the finest buildings in Turkey, is an oblong, divided into an outer court, a caravanserai, and the apartments of the Pasha, which include a mosque. The outer walls are high and strong, the spacious courts are paved with stone, and the doors and windows are ornamented with beautifulBAY arabesque carving'. The fortifications are for the most part excavated in the perpendicular rocks east of the place. They consist of batteries, covered passages, and round towers built on projecting- ledges, and extend far up the precipice; all are deserted and half ruined. There is a spring of water in the rock, but the fortress is untenable against artillery, for an opposite hill, quite within cannon-shot, looks down into the greater part of the works. The town is now in a most dilapidated and ruined state, the bazaars are wretched and ill supplied, and the place does not wear the appearance of commercial activity. The people are an uncouth and ill-disposed race, and have contracted the rude manners of the Kurd tribes by which they are surrounded and w ith whom they are in constant contact. Fraser says of it— This is a truly singular place. A jutting rock, projecting from a high and most rugged mountain, cut into thousands of ravines, is crowned by the castle. The city is built among the clefts on either side, and yoii do not see half of it until you climb up and get into it as into a bird's nest. One wonders what tempted men to choose a spot so unpromising for a city, even in regard to security, for not only is it commanded on all sides but the inhabi tants themselves have a most difficult ascent to surmount every time they leave and return to their houses with the thousand other inconveniences which must attach to so lofty a dwelling. The evidences of the fallen condition of Bayazid are patent at eveiy foot step as you clamber from ruin to ruin. The miserable bazaars of scattered shops are furnished without the very dregs of the necessaries of life, and the wretched shop-keepers sit among their tumble-down tenements like- the withered remnants of an exhausted people. It was here that M. Jaubert, sent on a mission by Napoleon to the Shah of Persia, was waylaid and confined. The present reigning family of Bayazld are Kurds of the Zilanli tribe, and date their rise from M ah mud Pasha, whom they call Buzurg, or the Great. He was succeeded by Ishak Pasha, who commenced the handsome castle, which is the residence of the present Pasha, and who also was a great Chief, and a great tyrant. On his death his brother, Ibrahim, made an effort to set aside his nephew, Mahamad; but the young man's rights were asserted by the father of Sadak Beg, at that time the most powerful noble of the coun try, who succeeded in placing him on the musnud. Mahamad, however, died after a few months, and was succeeded by Ibrahim, who revenged himself for the opposition of the OnverdT Chief, by destroying all the property of his family in the town, while Sadak Beg himself, then a youth, was forced to fly for his life; nor did he return till after the death of Ibrahim, which took place some years after. Ibrahim was eventually taken prisoner by the Turkish Governor at Arzrum, who pillaged his treasury, and carried him off to that city, placing Behlul, son of Mahamad, upon the ' musnud/ About four or five years afterwads Behlul, who was deficient in all the qualities requisite to form a fit ruler of so turbulent a country, was in his turn carried off to Arzrum along with every thing the UsmanlTs could lay hands upon. Next came the war with Persia in 1822, when the pillage was completed by All Khan, the Persian General, who took up his quarters at Bayazid, and swept away the miserable leavings of the Turks. The Pasha, and all the Chiefs they could catch, including Sadak Beg, were made prisoners on this occasion and carried off to Khoi, where some, if not the whole, of them were detained a year. Still plundered and trampled on as they were by Turk and 81 l82 bay—beb Persian, the population of Bayazid remained, and with it the materials of reviving 1 prosperity. The finishing blow was reserved for Russia, who by utterly depopulating both town and country, and pillaging the little that had been collected since past misfortunes, deprived both of the means of renovation, while they wantonly destroyed what they could not carry off. 11 is scarcely possible that the place can be re-peopled ; it has neither com merce nor facilities for manufactures of any sort, nor any advantage of situation to recommend it. Its former population and prosperity were owing, probably, to the protection which the inhabitants enjoyed in a strong fortress, under bold and successful Chiefs; this now being at an end there is nothing to induce a fresh colony to re-occupy the ruins. In the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-9 Bayazid surrendered to Prince Tchef- chewadza after a few shots, and General Penkratieff's division wintered here after the first campaign. In the ensuing campaign, while Paskiwitz was pursuing his victorious march to Arzrum the Pasha of V an assembled all the men he could and made a vigorous attempt to drive the Russians out of Bayazid. The garri son consisted of 2,000 Russian troops and 1,006 Armenian militia. The Pasha succeeded in bringing about 10,000 men and seven guns to the attack and after a hard contest he drove the Russians from all their outworks into the old and new castles. The Turks then made four determined attacks on the Russian forts, much reduced by the loss of 400 men and four guns; they were, however, repulsed after having lost in the actions between the 6th and SiDth June nearly 2,000 men. The Pasha then retired.— [Kinneir— Monteith — // agner—Fraser—Stuart—Brant—Imperial Gazetteer?) BAZAAI—Lat. Long. !Elev. A village in the Province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, 18 miles north-east of Mnsal. It is situated under a line of hills and has an extensive olive wood in front of it, from which much of the olive oil used in Miisal is taken. It is principally consumed in the manufacture of soap, not being of a sufficiently good quality for eating probably from negligence in the preparation.

They appear to be a spur of the main Kurdistan range from Mount Azmir. There are two passes over it, called Seghirmeh and Darband-i-Bazian. The range is of calcareous formation and the strata all incline to the west. 1 heie is a Government of Bazian which is said to extend from a stream call ed the red valley half an hour west of the Darband, to the summits of the hills north-east of Derghezin, under Mount Azmir. In this range are found deer, wild goats, bears and leopards.— (Rich.) BEBBEH—Lat. Long. Elev. A division of the Kfirds, who are now dominant at Salimania. They were formerly very powerful, all the country as far as Zengabad, Mendali, Bedran Jessan, with Altun Kopri, Arbel, and even Senna being subject to them. Ihey have a tradition that they are descended on the female side fr on( \Keigha n , a European Princess, whose life was spared by their ancestor, rakib Ahmad.? und who in return married him.83 BEB—BED The Bebbehs were feudal Chiefs of Pizhder, under tlie Sorans, and their capital at that time was Darishmana, but which is now a miserable villag-e of about eighteen houses. The Bebbeh family was a branch of the Sekkir clan, and that the Shm- kis and Ghellalis were related to them. The Bebbeh family has chieHy ren dered itself remarkable since the extinction of the ancient house ol Soran, about two hundred years ago. They first descended from Mount Pizhder, conquered JVtergeh, ]Vlorwutt, and Kizzeljee from the Persians, and .Zeng&lt; iu ii from a particular family, a part of which is now existing at Kirmanshah, who, though they speak Kurdish, are not accounted real Kurds; possibly the family was of the peasant race. BECHEBARMAK— Lat. Long. Elev. A remarkable mountain on a spur of the Caucasus, which terminates north of the district of Apsheron, Georgia. (Chesnei/.) BEDISTAN— Lat. Long. Elev.^ A village in the sub-division of KizljT, Sulimania, 1 urkish Kurdistan. It is 'situated at the foot of the hills, and is curiously thrust in, not in the most advantageous situation, under the foot of an insulated rock about 200 feet in height, which cuts it off from the vale in which the Bedistan River flows and renders its position warm and close. On the south tlie hills are very high composed seemingly, like all the hills in this part, of gypsum, variouslv tinged with iron and some schistous laminoe and clothed with dwaif oak. On the north is a bare high rock, at the foot of which the village stands, and on whose summit are some vestiges of building, ihe whole breadth of the interval between the rock and the hills does not exceed a quarter of a mile. To the east it is more open, and the view in that diiec- tion is bounded by mountains. The village is the capital ol Kizlji. It contains about 50 houses, of which 15 or 20 are inhabited by Jews. The Bedistan River (which is sometimes called the Tatlan) joins the Kizlji River below Karacholan. ISot far south of Bedistan are some warm springs. Rich, following the Kurdish pronunciation, calls this place Bistan. [Rich.) BE-DOKAN—Lat. Long. Elev.

A tribe of Shamr Arabs who inhabit the northern part of the Al-Jazira in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey. They pay no tribute whatever to the Turkish Government; on the contrary, their headmen receive a monthly salary from the Turks, and levy in addition black mail from every traveller and caravan passing through their territory, and also from all the villages and towns in the plains subject to them. They are the curse of the country, and have totally put a stop to everything like cultivation and improvement in the splendid tracts they call their own. Under a strong Government and with the water system, soil and climate of that part of the Al-JazTra, ter minated by the Jaghgagha and Khabur, several thousand bales of cotton alone of a very fair quality might be raised annually. Now r , however, the country is literally a desert, a vast uninhabited plain, though studded profusely with old tumula and heaps of rubbish, the former abodes of an exuberant,84 BED—BEN peaceful, and industrious population.

A small tiibe of Arabs who live in the Province of Baghdad between Samavat and Khuzil.— [Kinneir). BENI LAM—Lat. Long. Elev. A powerful tribe ol Arabs, of whom Layard gives the following account:— They occupy the south-eastern portion of the Province of Baghdad and are included in that Government, though many of their divisions occasionally 800 Tents. 2,000 „ 1,000 „ 2,000 2,500 Tents.85 BEN encamp within the province of Khuzistan, Persia. It is difficult to deter mine with any certainty the territories of the Chief (Shekh) of this tribe. The Beni Lam encamp even at the ^ates of Mandali and occupy the country between that town and Badrai. The plains at the foot of the mountains from Mandali to the banks of the River Kerkhah afford them pasturage for their cattle during the winter^ although a portion of this country belongs to the Feili by whom it is occupied. The village of Beyat which they inhabit belongs to them as well as half the district of Petak. On the banks of the Tigris they are found from the vicinity of Kut-el-Hamra to almost the junction of that river with the Euphrates. The low hills dividing the plains of Dasht-Abbas from that of Iwan-i-Kerkhah are usually considered their western boundaries^ Iwan being it is said on Persian ground. The Beni Lam also encamp on the banks of the Kerkhah although their territories terminate about eight or ten miles to the west of it. The tribe is divided into numerous branches, the names of which are:— Chenanah M ayzah. (xheleimi. Keserayi-Albas-Turki. Keserayi Shamki. Keserayi Ali Hussein. Chab. Seyzid Hasan. Derbelu. Zibrij.

Bad hi or Razi. He war. Sbeikb Abmed. Of these tribes the Kesarayi-Abbas-Turki, Keserayi Shamki, Keserayi Ali Hussein, Sheitat, Yuranizah, Sekur, Ebn Abdal Khan usually encamp on the banks of the river Kerkhah within the territories of the Wali of Hawiza. The Beni Lam occupying the frontiers of the Turkish and Persian empires are but slightly depenclent upon either. They are continually engaged in plundering expeditions, and in war are most treacherous and dishonest and proverbially feared throughout the province. Although there is a C hief (Shekh) for the whole tribe yet each division has its own Shekh, who, conti nually engaged in plundering and robbing, is very little under c mtrol. It is difficult to estimate positively the number of families composing this very extensive tribe, but it is probable that with their dependencies they amount to nearly 30,000. When Layard visited them the principal Shekh, whose authority was not acknowledged by all the tribe, could muster about 15,000 armed men, of which perhaps 4,000 to 5,000 were horsemen. In wars with the Montefik Arabs the Beni Lam had been continually defeated and they are probablv deficient in courage. During the summer they congregate near the Tigris and on the borders of the vast inland marshes formed by its waters. In the winter and summer [sic.) they usually encamp in the sandstone and gypsum hills running parallel to the great range, or in the plains at the foot of the mountains. They mix with the Feili tribes of Pusht-i-koh and pasture86 BEN their flocks on their lands for which they yearly pay a small sum to the Chief (Wali). They are usually on ^ood terms with the inhabitants of the mountains, whose Chiefs continually take refuge in their tents when oppressed by the Government or expelled by their own tribes. The Beni Lam pay a capitation tax to the Pasha of Baghdad and occasionally send presents to the Persian Governor of Khuzistan. J ones' account, however, differs so much from the above that I prefer to giving it whole to endeavouring to reconcile their statements. ' Next in order to the Montefik is the great tribe of Beni Lam, occupying both banks of the Tigris, from the Hai river to the Hud. They are said to derive their origin from one Waiil, a contemporary and comrade of Khalid iu the wars of Mahamad, whose power united them under a common banner. Their name, Beni Lam, signifies ' the collected sons.^ Like the Montefik they have become broken from internal jealousies fomented by the Turks. Two Shekhs now govern separate portions of the tribe. They are thus greatly weakened. They pay an irregular tribute, but they are assessed at about a lakh of Shamies, excluding contingent presents:— &gt;• Beni Lam Families. Tents. Locality.

This is the native estimate of their strength, but it is probably much over stated. An allowance of a gun to a tent is a fair estimate of their strength in this arm. They are good horsemen, have plenty of flocks and herds, besides camels and tolerable horses. When at feud with the authorities, they stop the trade by the river, and at all times levy a toll on passing boats. They encourage cultivators from the Luristan mountains near them to cultivate the great plains they occupy, but do not degrade themselves by tilling the ground. They take the daughters of the neighbouring AFbu Mahamad tribes as wives, but will not give their females in marriage to them, or indeed to any race inferior to themselves. The tribe are all Shlahs of a fanatical class. When pressed by the Government, they fly into the Persian territories bordering upon HawTza. One portion of this tribe, at strife with the rest, has been located in Persian territory for years past. BENI TIM1N.—Lat. Long. Elev. Two tribes of Arabs, one of which numbers 150 tents and resides between Sindieh and the Adheym in the Province of Baghdad, and the other numbers 300 tents and resides at Belad Ruz. They are portions of an ancient Nejd family but degenerated into settled cultivators in various parts.— [Junes.)87 BEN—BID BKNI TIMIN.—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs who wander in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, west of Baghdad as far as Musyib near Akarkiif, They number 300 tents and are mixed, pastoral and agricultural.

A river of Kurdistan, which is believed to rise in the slopes of the Ardish Tagh some miles south of the east extremity of Lake Van, from whence it winds through limestone formation with a general direction south-south east to its junction with the Julamerik branch of the Zab lliver at Kivan in Warendum in about Lat 37 0 5 / Long 43 o 80/ In the latter part of its course it is augmented by the Maranan and Leihun and several other streams. On the upland of Leihun the Berdizawi is divided into three branches which unite lower down. The most westerly is the smallest, being only a few yards in width, the second comes from north-west and is 20 yards wide and very deep, and its channel much filled with boulders; the third comes from north 20° east and is 22 yards wide and from four to six feet deep. There are twig bridges over each of these streames beneath which they roll with the noise and rapidity of mountain torrents. To the north of the junction of the Maranan River and south of that of Leihun the Berdizawi falls with a roaring noise and cloud of foam and spray over a fall formed by the clift's on either bank meeting in the centre of the stream. This river is crossed by twig bridges below the Leihun junction and above the Maranan junction.— {Ainsworth—Chesney.) BERGUSHET—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the district of Karabagh, Georgia, which joins the left bank of the Aras river a short distance from its junction with the Kur. [Chesney). BERIlAWI—Lat. Long. Elev.

A district of Lesg-istau in the Caucasus, but where situated is not stated. It seems to have been independent, the Government being a sort of Republic. It became subject to Russia long before the other LesgT States and appears to have remained faithful to it. The country is described as beautifully wooded and with the richest soil imaginable. It pays a tribute of 20,000 ducats to Russia. [Monteith.) BING6L StJ—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the Bingol Tagh, a lofty range to the south and west of Khinis, and joins the Kaleh Su just beyond the bridge of Choban Kopri, through different arches of which these streams run to unite below and form the Aras. As it has a longer course and a greater volume of water than the Kaleh Sn, it is entitled to be considered the principal source of the Aras, and indeed it is often called by this name by the natives. {Ainsworth—Brant.) BlNGOL TAGH—Lat. Long. Elev. A mountain in the Province of Arzrum and 30 miles south-west of that town, and nearly in the centre of the space between the east and west branches of Euphrates. Bill—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Orfah, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of Euprates. It contains about 1,700 houses which cover the valley, the bank of the river, and also the side of the hill northward as well as east of the castle. It is surrounded by a substantial wall which is partly of Turkish architecture, partly that of the middle ages. The castle of Bir rises from the bank of the river so as to command the passage of the river on the opposite side. The town is sur rounded on the land side by a mud wall with towers at the angles and pierced with loopholes. The streets are narrow but clean. In the centre on a steep rock is an old ruined fortification. The rocks on which Bir is built are of chalk and the houses are of the same material, the whiteness of which in bright sunshine is painful to the eyes, on approaching it from Orfah, that is quite hid till you come quite close upon it. There is a fine stream at the top of the hill which supplies the town with water. That of the Euphrates is muddy and bad. Bir has long been the point where cara vans and travellers from Aleppo to Orfah, Diarbakr, Baghdad and Persia cross the Euphrates and it is consequently one of the most frequented of all the ferries on that river, and about 16 large passage boats are kept here in a state of repair for the use of the caravans, which occasionally number as many as 5,000 camels. It is also the point from which Chesney proposed to commence the navigation of the Euphrates. It is 140 miles from the Mediterranean at the mouth of the Orontes and 1117 to the Persian Gulf by the windings of the river. {Chesney—Foiling ton.) BIRCHALI—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Georgia on the banks of the Grain, a tributary of the Kur river. BIRS NCMR1D—Lat. Long. Elev. Some ruins in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, situated six miles from Ilillah, supposed by Niebuhr. Rich, and ethers to have been the celebrated temple of Belus.— [Chesney).BIT 131TLIS—Lat. Long. Elev. 5,150. A town in the Province of Mush, Asiatic Turkey. This town has a very remarkable appearance, placed in a wide ravine which is open to the east but closed by high mountains to the west; the houses are dispersed over the sides of the steep banks of the stream which runs through it and on several neighbouring hills. The stream is crossed by single arched bridges, which are sufficiently numerous to afford a ready passage from one part of the town to another. The form of the town is therefore most irregular, the houses are built of red stone which is cut into square blocks, and all are flat roofed; the generality are of two-stories with grated windows to the street which produces more resemblance to the towns of Europe than to those of Persia. The streets are paved with round stones. From the irregular manner in which the houses are scattered over the hills, intermingled with gardens, the town covers a considerable space of ground; it is not enclosed by a wall, but this is scarcely necessary, each house being in fact a fortress and a strong one too. It is said by Shiel to contain 1,500 houses, of which 500 are occu pied by Armenians, but Brant says it has 2,000 Mahamadan and 1,000 Arme nian families. To this class belong the bakers, butchers, grocers, &amp;c., of the city. Bitlis contains four caravanserais, three large and 12 small mosques, three baths, eight Armenian churches, and one Nestorian. The large mosques have each one very tall minaret which has a very pleasing effect. Of butchers, bakers, gunsmiths, and silversmiths the number is very considerable, there being nearly 20 of each trade. The bazaars are extensive and apparently well stocked; they are entirely terraced over, and the roof is used as a highway for foot passen gers. The road through them runs between the shops, and is narrow, scarcely permitting more than the passage of two persons abreast, and from the crowd which throngs them they are difficult to make one's way through. They are very dark, the light being admitted only by means of holes made for the purposes at intervals in the roof. The principal manufacture is coarse striped cotton cloth, and the chief export is tobacco, pears, apples, plums, apricots, grapes, melons; cucumbers, lettuces, cabbages, and other vegetables come to perfection. The most remarkable object in Bitlis is the old castle which is placed in the centre of the town, on a rock thirty feet in height and built up with stone to the elevation of about 100 feet; the walls are extremely thick and loopholed, and the narrow and steep passage which gives admission to the fort is defended by several strong gates; the extent of the inside may be 120 yards, it is now in ruins and filled with old houses. The wall is strength ened by several square bastions on the outside. The Begs of Bitlis were always powerful enough to preserve their inde pendence until they were subdued by the father of Amir Pasha, since which time the Beg has been attached to the Pashalik of Mush; eighty villages were said to have been under the Beg, and his territory therefore formed about one-third of the present Pashalik of Mush. The residence of the Beg is situated on a short spur thrown out towards the south from the mountains and running half way across the mouth of the east ravine. The level summit of the spur is occupied by the building from the walls of which the ground slopes abruptly ; on the west it overhangs the town ; on the east the ravine which unites with the main valley under the south termi nation of the spur. This elevated position, upwards of 300 feet above the valley, ensures a cool breeze in summer when the town below is oppressed 89 M90 BIT with heat. This palace was erected about 30 years a&lt;?o; it is a rude and extensive building. In the centre is a quadrang-ular court, with a copious fountain of tine water placed on the side facing- the entrance: three sides are devoted to the use of the male portion of the Beg^s establishment and his own sitting and receiving rooms, and the fourth to the harem. The ground floor contains the stabling and store houses. In that alone are the rooms, which are all entered from an open gallery overlooking the court. The windows are on the outer walls of the building and command extensive views. In the centre of the rooms are bare flag-stones, and on either side is a raised soft bench on which are felt with cushions. In summer the heat at Bitlis is not oppressive except in situations inaccessible to the breeze, which usually blows down the valley. In winter the snow falls and drifts into the valleys to so great a depth that the communication with other places is always difficult and often interrupted. In point of trade Bitlis is the most important place in the Pashalik, yet still its commercial transactions are far from extensive. The consumption of foreign articles is small in quantity and limited in variety. No coffee but that of Mokha is used, which is brought from Baghdad; a small quantity of East India indigo is required for a dyeing establishment, which is generally supplied through Arzrum and Persia. Unbleached British calicoes are sold to a moderate extent, and shawls to a less: besides these some woollen cloths, printed calicoes, and gay-coloured silks and satins are purchased, and a small quantity of refined sugar. The principal consumption is in the manufactures of Damascus, Aleppo, and Diarbakr, and coarse cotton cloths are manufactured here largely and imported also from different parts of the country for the purpose of being dyed red. This place is celebrated for the brightness of the colour produced, and the cloths thus dyed are exported to distant parts of the country as well as to Georgia. A few European calicoes are likewise dyed but the great bulk are Native. The manufacture of short heavy calicoes is very extensive throughout the whole country. The cotton used is mostly grown in the districts of Shirvan to the south and Khargan to the west, but it is imported likewise from Khol. Although the raw cotton is as dear as in England, and although the yarn is spun by hand and woven by the most ordinary process, yet the calico is sold cheap : and it is to be doubted whether the British manufacture could be got to compete with it, on account of the low quality the great weight of cotton used in the latter and the great expense of a long land carriage on an article so bulky and at the same time of comparatively so little value. The production of calicoes amounts to several hundred thousand pieces, but a tolerably exact account cannot possibly be obtained. The madder used in dyeing the red colour is produced in Shirvan. Galls are brought to Bitlis for sale from the Kurdistan mountains to the east and south. A considerable quantity of gum tragacanth may be collected on the mountains. There are two plants, one with a white and the other with a pink flower. The former yields a white gum, which is exported to Europe, and the latter, a brown kind, of very inferior quality, which is used entirely in Turkey. The gum is collected by persons who traverse the mountains for the purpose; they clear away the earth from the roots of the plants and make incisions on them from which the juice exudes and in a day or two hardens, when the people return to gather it. The occupation affords but a trifling remuneration under ordinary circumstances, and few people follow it except such as can91 BIT—BLA do notliinof else, as old men, women, and children, bnt when the demand is great and the price unusually hig-h, other labourers take to the pursuit, and an immense quantity is collected, for the plant is most abundant on all the mountains.— (Shiel—Brant.) BITLIS CHAI—Lat. Long. Elev.

Lat. 40° to 46° 37' Long. 27° 25' to 41° 46' Elev. A large inland sea, bounded north and north-west by Russia, north-east by Caucasia, west by Turkey in Europe, south by Anatolia and south-east by Armenia. Its greatest length from east to west is about 700 miles ; and its breadth is about 300 miles ; the extent of its coast is upwards of 2,000 miles; and its area is variously estimated at 160,000 and 180,000 square miles. It receives some of the largest rivers in Europe, including the Danube, Dniepei, and Dniester, and drains a surface of 950,000 square miles ; its waters aie, in consequence, only brackish. Its depth in general is great, no bottom having been found in some parts with a line of 140 fathoms, although, in a few places, as the Strait of Yenikale, it does not exceed 10, 20, or 30 feet, while oft' the mouth of the Danube the water deepens so gradually from the shore that the distance from the latter may be ascertained within half a mile by soundings alone. Throughout the whole of the Black Sea there are scarcely any rocks, and almost everywhere are excellent anchoring places. Storms are raie, and, when they do occur, are of short duration, seldom lasting more than 1 ^ hours without considerable abatement. During the summer north winds prevail, and south in the beginning of autumn and spring. Ihe foimei fie- quently detain vessels from the Mediterranean in the Dardanelles and Bosphoi us for weeks together. The currents of the Black Sea generally have a ten dency towards the Bosphorus or Channel of Constantinople. The most constant and powerful is that which sets along the west shore, from the mouth of the Dnieper to the Bosphorus, occasioned by the great influx of water, especially on the melting of the snow, from the great rivers that fall into the north-west portion of this inland sea. ihere is no flow of tide in the Black Sea, the slight difference of elevation that occasionally occurs arising solely from the winds and currents. The south coast of jthe Crimea, and the coast of Anatolia and Caucasia, abound in lofty mountains, which rise up immediately from the margin of the sea, and afford excellent land marks. On the north-west and north the coast is generally low, and on this account dangerous, as it can be seen only from a very short distance. Harbours and bays are numerous, and many of them good; but theie aie none of any great extent. Those that penetrate deepest into the land aie the Gulf of Kerkinet on the north, between the Crimea and the mainland; the Gulfs of Rassein and Burgas on the west, and those of Sinope and Sam- sun on the south. There are no remarkable projections or headlands, ex cepting those formed by the west and south extremities ol the Ciimea, amBLA—BOH Cape Indjeh and Bozdepeh in Anatolia. The Black Sea communicates with the Sea of Azof by a narrow channel, called the Straits of Kertsch or Yenikale, and with the Mediterranean by the Bosphorus or Channel or Strait of Constantinople, the Sea of Marmora, and the Dardanelles. There are few fisheries of any importance carried on in the Black Sea, although it abounds with various kinds of fish, including porpoises, sturgeons, dolphins, mackerel, mullet, bream, &amp;c. Seals also are numerous One of the most extensive fisheries is at the entrance of the Strait of Yenikale, where considerable quantities of sturgeon are taken. The north ports are frequently shut up by ice for three or four months in the year, or from about December to March. The Black Sea extended at a remote period much further east and north than it now does, occupying the whole of the vast plains and steppes that surround the Caspian and the Sea of Aral, in Tartary, neither of which had then a separate existence, being included in this great inland sea. The relative level of the Black Sea with the Caspian on the one hand, and the ocean on the other, were long undetermined points, but seem now to be pretty well ascertained. It has been found that the Caspian is 101 feet lower than the Black Sea, and that the latter is precisely of the same level as the ocean. That it is however a little, though perhaps but a very little, above the level of the Mediterranean, which is itself kept below that of the Atlantic by evaporation, would appear from the almost constant flow of a current towards the Grecian Archipelago through the Dardanelles. The amount of evaporation which takes place in the Black Sea must be also very great, as the discharge by the Bosphorus is wholly insuffi cient to account for the disposal of the immense quantities of water passed into it by its rivers. How it should retain its saltness, notwithstanding this large and constant accession of fresh water, has not yet been satisfactorily explained. The Black Sea was explored at an early period by the Greeks, who, from their ignorance of the arts of navigation and ship-building, represented it as beset with dangers of the most formidable kind ; and who, it has been said, give it the name of f Black' Sea as expressive of the dread and terror in u hich they held it—a feeling further manifested by their placing the Cim merian land of everlasting darkness on its north shore. Having gathered courage from experience, the Greeks, at a later period, formed numerous establishments along its shores, from which they carried on an extensive trade in slaves, cattle, and corn ; and to this day their vessels are the most numeroiis in the Black Sea, the greater part being employed in exporting the coin, hides, timber, iron, and furs of Russia, and in importing wine and * o 1 ! . w! 0 tmin 11 futures of England and France.— {Imperial Gazetteer.)

The streams which go to form this river flow with arrow-like swiftness through deep rocky beds pent in by high mountains. Practicable fords at all seasons are rarely met with, and for tins reason its different affluents are generally bridged at the points of passage.

A large inland sea of Central Asia, bounded north and west by Russia, east by lurkomama, and south by Persia. Its greatest length from north to south is 730 miles; and its greatest breadth is 270 miles; its narrowest part 9495 CAS between Cape Apsheron in Georgia and Cape Tarta in east coast being- ISO miles. Its area is 140,000 square miles, and it drains in Europe alone an extent of 850,000 square miles. Althoug-h at some points the Caspian attains a considerable depth, Han way having in one place found no bottom at 480 fathoms, it is remarkable for its shallowness generally, especially along its shores where it seldom exceeds 3 feet for a distance of 100 yards from the land. The principal bays on the east side are Emba Bay, Mersa Bay, Dead Bay, Black Lake Bay, Mangishlak Gulf, Beklirlishal Bay, Kenderlinsk Gulf, Kara Bughaz Gulf, and Balkan Bay. On the opposite side occur the Gulfs of Kizl Agatch and Kuma, with several less marked indentations. The only one on the south coast is Astrabad Bay, if the inlet of Enzeli, which has only four feet water, be excluded. The Caspian contains numerous islands, but not many of any great extent. The largest are on the east side, the greatest number on the west and north particularly about the mouths of the Volga, and along the coasts to the north-east and south-west of them, where they lie closely crowded together in countless numbers, most of them however, being mere islets. The waters of the Caspian are salt, but not nearly so much so as those of the ocean, and its colour is a very delicate and liquid blue, and at the mouth of the rivers the water for a considerable distance out is very much less salt than out at sea. It has no tides, and no outlets, its superfluous waters being carried off solely by evaporation. The affluents of the Caspian are the Ural, Volga, Kuma, Terek, Kur, Kizl Ozan, Gurgan, and Atrak. In the region of the Volga including the territory from that river south-east to the Emba, and south-west to the left bank of Sulak, the whole seaboard is composed of recent alluvium, deposited by the several streams. From south of the Sulak to Apsheron, the coast is of upper tertiary formation, broken into at some points by carboniferous strata. South from Apsheron, and round the south extremity of the sea, the coast is low and sandy, backed at some distance by lofty hills. The east and south-east coasts have gene rally a cretaceous subsoil overspread by moving sand, and are generally flat. Cape Karagan, formed by mountains of the same name, being an exception. Sturgeons and sterlets are caught in the Caspian in great quantities; and there are also salmon-trout, perch, silurus glanis, two kinds of carp and porpoises. Seals abound in the upper coasts, and tortoises between the mouths of the Volga and the Ural. The mollusks are few, said to be only four,— car dium rusticcnm, cardium triquetram, my a edentula, and mytlus poly- morphus. The chief fishery for sturgeon is at and near Astrakhan; in and about the river Emba it comprehends 310 miles of coast, from the mouth of the Ural to the gulf called Mertvoi-koultouk. The island of Tchetchenze, near the Gulf of Agrakhan, and not far from the Cape of that name, contains a large establishment for smoking, drying, and salting fish. In the surrounding waters, the fishing is continued all the year. It is not so in the rorth region, where the first or caviare season, as it is called, occurs between March and May, when the Volga, Ural, &amp;c., are getting cleared of ice. The second season occurs in July, when the sturgeon descends the rivers; and the third or open era fishing goes on from September to November. During the win ter the north fishermen often venture on the ice many miles from land, in quest of sturgeon, silures, and seals. But, in general, it is reckoned unfair to kill seals before the ISth of April. Besides the foregoing, there are96 CAS fisheries between Salian, Siphitourinsk and AstrSbad. Many thousand persons are employed in the Russian Upper Caspian hshenes ; and the annual amount of caviare or female roes obtained may betaken at1(1 ,,s -' besides 20,00011 *3. of isinglass, the produce of upwards ot 700,00U stur geons of various kinds, large and small. The number of seals annually taken is nearly 100,000. . A , „ The only ports at all worthy the name on the Caspian are Astva- khan, Baku, Salian, and Astarabad. The navigationis at all times difh- cult, and often perilous. Steam packets on it have recently been established. The basin of the Caspian is most extensive on the north and west trom which it receives the Ural, the Volga, the Terek, the KQr and numerous other streams of less note. By means of a canal cut near Iver in Kussia, between the head streams of the Volga, and the Rivers Ivertza and Schilina, water communication is established between the Caspian and the Baltic Seas. The basin of the sea is limited on the south by the ElbOrz Mountains, and on the east the sandy wastes of Khiva send to it only short streams, and ot no grreat volume; though on this side it evidently at one time received the Oxus or Amoo, now an affluent of the Sea of Aral. Indeed, the Caspian and Lake Aral were doubtless at one period united. They are apparently on t he same level; and though the plateau of Vst-Vrt (see Aral) might at first sight appear to present an insuperable obstacle to the idea of a junction ev or having existed, yet south of that plateau, and in the course which the Oxus probably followed, is a low tract leading into the bend of what was at one time the estuary of the Oxus, but now is a sandy waste, east and south ot Kara Bughaz Gulf, which formed its termination. Abbott says that precisely the same shells are found in the shell lime-stone in the neighbourhood ot Khiva to the shores of the Caspian. Both lakes belong to the great depres sion of West Asia—a depression at one time supposed to be much greater than it is believed to be now, though whether a rise in the land has taken place, it is difficult to determine. The exact amount of the depression has not yet been satisfactorily settled, the most trustworthy data we possess being at variance. The last two levellings between the Caspian and the Black Sea, both trigonometrical, were executed, the one in 1887 by Messrs. h uss, Sabler and Sawitch, under the auspices of the Academie Impenale de -SV. Petersburg and the other in 1838-39, by M. Hommaire de Hell. Accord ing to the former measurement, the Caspian is 81-4 feet below the level o the Black Sea; but according to the latter it is only 11-6 metres, about 38^ feet. Should the latter measurement be ultimately found to be correct, what has hitherto been supposed to be the depression of \V estern Asia may turn out to be actually above the level of the ocean. Ihe sandmg-up or streams lessening the accession of water, and contracting the shoies, with the great evaporation constantly going on, in addition to other causes m operation, are gradually reducing the size of the inland sea. It has been supposed to increase and decrease in size at certain times, but this pheno mena is now believed to be explained by the fact that strong winds beating for anv length of time upon the flat shore sometimes drive the waters up over a great extent of land. M. Hommaire de Hell alleges that a rise ot even 10 feet would flood the steppes of the Kuma for a vast distance beyond the route between Astrakhan and the Terek, and submerge every post-house and military station along the line. It may consequently be taken for granted that no such rise has taken place; at all events since theCAS beginning of last century, when the first Russian settlements in these regions were established, otherwise we should have had authentic records of such a visitation. The notices of early commerce upon or by way of the Caspian are few and uncertain. Even for several centuries after the Christian era, its authentic trading records are nearly a blank. The chief portion of the commerce between West Europe and India was carried on partly by its waters, about the middle of the 13th century, Astrakhan, on the upper Caspian, and Soldaia, nearly in the same latitude, on the Black Sea, forming the chief entrepots till 1280, when the latter was superseded through the exertions of the Genoese, for their own establishment at Kaffa, which then became the transit station for the Asiatic European trade, and so con tinued till 1453, when the Turks having seized Constantinople, and barred the Bosphorus, the accustomed trade was forced into other channels, and the Caspian deserted, except by the few vessels which carried on a small local trade between Muscovy, Persia, and Central Asia. About 1560 an English Trading Company endeavoured to open up connections, by way of the Caspian Sea, with Persia and Turkomania, but with no good results. From that time till late in the 17th century, the annals of navigation give few notices of this sea. At the latter period Peter the Great, partly in the hope of diverting the Indian trade into the direction of his south domi nions, caused the coasts of the Caspian to be explored by Dutch naviga tors in his pay. His intention was, as one means to his end, to found trad ing stations on ground ceded by treaty or taken by force, on the Persian seaboard. But this he delayed to do; and when he died, his project lay dor mant, and the Russians made no encroachment beyond what Peter had already effected, till the reign of Catherine II., whose conquests in its south region were not secured till our own times. The Caspian is called by the Persians sometimes Daria Kulzum, sometimes Daria Hashtakhan, Daria Khizzur; by the Russians the sea of Gualenskoi or that of Gevalienske; by the Georgians, Sgwa; and Suf by the Armenians. The east coast of the Caspian, says Eichwald, with the exception of the projecting promontory of Tuk-Karagan and a few gulfs, extends nearly in a direct line more than 10° in length from north to south, between the parallels of 37° and 47° nearly. The small gulf of Astrabad forms its southern limit, whilst its northern boundary is marked by a very large bight at its north-east extremity, which receives the waters of the Emba. The principal branch of this river expands before it reaches the sea, into a great many shallow basins, like lakes, the northern branch of it being nearly choked up with sand. All this part of the coast, as well as that adjoining to the north and north-west, is extremely flat and shallow; as the large rivers, namely, the Aral, the Volga, and the Tuck, which here empty themselves into the sea, are constantly bringing along with them a quantity of sand which is accumulated on the shores; consequently the whole of the northern part of the Caspian Sea, which is exceedingly low, together with the adjoining eastern coast, is so shallow, that for the distance of several miles from the shore there is only a few feet depth of water, and an immense number of small sand-hills and banks of sand make it difficult to land on any part of 1 t. Similar sand-hills occupy also the shore itself, which extend to a consi derable distance inland among the steppes; but it cannot be said that they form any connecting chains of hills. 97 N98 CAS At the very commencement of this Sinus Mortuus (Mertooi Kultuk), there rises a small chain of calcareous hills, called the Chink, which forms, as it were, the rampart of a remarkable high level, named Ust-lTrt, which extends under the 45th parallel, between the Aral and Caspian Seas, with a breadth of about 160 miles. This high plain is so steep towards both those seas, that it rises above the Caspian 689 Unglish feet, and its fall towards the site of the Aral is not less, though this last is 117 English feet above the level of the Caspian. This plain is never at a less elevation than 550 feet, and is in some places more than I'll feet above the level of the Caspian; it extends nearly in a direct line between the two seas, and it sinks so insensibly, that there is nowhere to be observed anything like a connected chain of hillocks, and it can only be considered in the light of one elevated plain. The extreme headlands of this high plain—namely, the Aksakal, the Surak, the Kara-kul, and the Kara-tau, form so many small connected hill tops round the bight of Tuk-Kara-su, which is the southern branch of the Sinus Mortuus. The summit of the Mangishlak and Tuk-Karagan hills is still higher than these hill-tops; they form the projecting promontory of Tuk-Karagan, and they rise nearly perpendicularly to the height of some hundred feet. This continuous range of hills encloses the whole coast from this spot to Alexander's Bay, and extends nearly straight from north to south, with the exception of a small divergence to the east. They consist throughout of a recent tertiary calcareous formation. The depth of this coast is very remarkable; it is seldom so little as six fathoms, generally between 10 and 18; and this has been observed in Alexander's Bay. This gulf is connected with a large bight, the entrance of which is formed by a precipitous rocky bank, from whence the bight widens considerably, and receives several rivers descending from the high plateau, namely, the Sirbash, the Kichik, and the Kumbenska. Further east, and a little to the south, where we come upon the gulf of Kenderlin, the land shelves off, but as it is entirely surrounded by hillocks it seems to receive no stream. Here, however, the hills of Kenderlin form again small chains connected with the larger hilly chain of the Karakhteh, and further inland they are quite lost in the elevated plateau. A coast stream, the Turakhth, here empties itself into the sea, between the Kender lin and Ksra-baghaz gulfs. The narrow entrance into this supposed very deep gulf is confined by a number of rocks, amongst which are some dangerous eddies, and it is sur rounded in all directions by a steep bank; along the whole of its coast there is but one inconsiderable stream, the Makranda. To the east it is bounded by some small hilly knolls, which extend from north to south; but these are less remarkable for their height than for the great number of salt lakes, most of them very small, which are in the lower valleys. Finally, under the 40° of north latitude the gulf of Balkan is bounded by the extreme points of this elevated plateau; here also the hills rise steep and precipitous from the bank, and present at the top porphyritic formations, which in remote times have broken through beds of granite, and which occur also round the Gulf of Kransnovodsk, at the entrance of the Bay of Balkan, and in some of the islands in the bay; but farther to the east they are at a greater distance from the shore, and are more inland where the flat and elevated plateau prevails. Here, likewise, this plateau consists of a tertiarv calcareous formation, which, towards the Balkan, crops out in single99 CAS protuberances. The great and little Balkan, and two lofty and insulated eminences, being- the extreme points of the Bulan mountain, a continuation of the farthest part of the elevated plateau, and to which they are united by the chain of the Kurreh mountain, and the Koshasuri mountain, form its southern limit, and shut into the east the Bay of Balkan, so that the Oxus could only have fallen into the bay between the great and little Balkan, whilst it wound round the southern point of the great Balkan, and thus emptied itself into the bay in a direction from south to north. In consequence of the confined outlet of this old river the bay is continu ally more and more choked up with sand, and has scarcely a depth of a few feet, though this is somewhat more considerable at the entrance into it, about the island of Dogadan. All this part of the coast is very much choked up with sand, and is very flat; the extreme points of the Ust-Irt, or the high plateau between the Caspian and the Aral, terminate at the end of the Krasnovodsk mountain, which to the north joins on to the chain of the great Balkan. This plateau again unites with the Mangojar hills, which are lost in the Aral chain; and we thus trace a continued high range of hills from the north-east to the south-west, less and less elevated as it approaches the south, presenting at its extreme limit, near the Balkan Gulf, the appearance of a crater, and porphyritic formations raised by volcanic influence through granitic and calcareous hills. It is exactly here, where the low shores presented the least resistance, that the eruption must have taken place. One consequence of this great and extensive elevation on the west, south, and east coasts of the Caspian has evidently been the great depression of western Asia, represented on the one side by the Caspian Sea itself, and on the other bv the low level which stretches out far to the north. The intermin able south Russian steppe, which is not indeed so deep as the Caspian, but which, as far as SaratU and Orenburg, is below the level of the ocean, and which at the eastern slope of the Aral, which rises from it as an elevated mountain range, contains up to the sources of the Tobol so many salt lakes, evident proofs of a sea-coast in very ancient times. The depth of this great depression of the old world increases in proportion as we approach the Caspian and the Aral Seas: thus on the north-west coast there is a depth of more than 50 toises below the sea level, at the mouth of the Tuck, while on the north-west coast of the Aral, in the desert of Borsuk, on the eastern slope of the Cst-Crt, w r here it is lost in the Mangojar hills, there is a relative depth of 31 toises below the surface of the ocean. The elevation of the Ust-Ort, which is more than 300 feet above the level of the ocean, and which connects with the Aral range by the Mangojar hills, affords an easy and convincing proof that the supposition of an out flow from the Aral into the Caspian, as well as that of any river flowing into the latter from the eastward of the steppe of the Kirghiz, are equally untenable. From the moment in which the Cst-Crtand the Mangojar ex tremity of the Aral were raised to their present elevation, at least during the great contemporaneous crater-like depression of Western Asia, that is since the first existence of the Caspian Sea, no river could possibly flow into that sea, either from the Aral or from the great steppe of the Khirghiz, or generally from Central Asia. The whole of the north part of the barren highlands of the east coast oi the Caspian is inhabited by Kirghiz-Kaz^ks, that to the south by100 CAS Iflrkomans and Khivalis. These tribes wander about with their tents, and carry on the coasting'-trade. A large sandy steppe, called Sam, which is entirely barren, and without water, marks the commencement of the elevated plateau; further south is a large salt lake, called Jareh Guzken, which still further south has several other smaller ones in its vicinity. The southern end of the east coast of the Caspian is devoid of any moun tainous formation, is quite flat and sandy, and has evidently been once covered by the sea, from which it is continually retreating. Besides the embouchure of the old Amu-daria, which has here, under the 39th paral lel, a depth of several fathoms, a circumstance which denotes also the bed of a large river in very remote times, we have in the 37th parallel, the Atrak, which seems to rise out of a salt spring, and flows northerly from Jordan or Gurgdn into the sea. As this whole extent of coast consists of a shifting sand, and is therefore extremely shallow to a considerable distance from the shore, with a depth of no more than a very few feet, we might naturally expect to find on the coast only detached sand-hills, connected sometimes in small chains, which evidently formed in ancient times sand-banks in the sea. Among these may especially be noticed the Green, White, and Silver Hills, which last lie near the mouth of the Gurgan, which in the middle ages was an important emporium for the trade with India. Astarabad also, which doubtless once florished in the south-easternmost angle of the Cas pian Sea, may then have been a trading place of some consequence, though at present the river which washes its walls has a course of several miles to the west before it reaches the sea, and the bay, which is very much choked up with sand, is no longer able to admit the larger class of merchantmen. Monteith who surveyed the south coast of the Caspian from Astara to Enzelli, says he found the coast invariably low, the water shallow, vessels of 150 tons being obliged to anchor at a distance of two miles. The prevailing wind were from east-north-east to east-south-east and a heavy surf ran on the beach. The only good inland route between the above places is along the sea shore, where a bank of sand about 100 yards in breadth runs parallel to it, beyond it are deep swamps and thick forests. On the least rain the streams from the mountains which intersect the Caspian provinces are liable to overflow and render the country almost impassable. Holmes also went from Astara to the east, and he says the sands are in some places two hundred yards, but often do not exceed 15 in breadth, and thick forest with a dense border of underwood consisting of hawthorn, wild pomegranate and medlar trees, descend from the mountains to their very edge. Abbott says that the south-west coast of the Caspian is verv shallow for many furlongs from the shore, and that he has observed single-masted vessels riding at anchor at about 10 or 15 miles out at sea. The rivers which fall into the Caspian on the south coast from Astara east to AstarS- bad are thus detailed by Holmes in the order in which they come, viz., Astara, Khojeh Ken, Khau rud Sevanderil, Tchilivand, Haji rustam, Lemir, Nobat chai, Helivi, Shilavan, Khat mesurah, Lissarchai, Kerghana rud, Hindekerron, Kelfa rud, Nova rud, Allalon chai, Kholasur, Dinachar chai, Sumerkerron, Alekion, Nokendeh, Shuari chai, Mahmud Tukiani in Talish, Mashad Kudbar, Bahambar, Ghorabar, Khalakaji, Chokover, Ispun, Bulgur, Sulugondeh, Churmscal, Siarvi, Lagsar, Siat derveshar, Hindu Kala, Nokaleh, Kifta rud, Pm Bazaar, Munzodeh, Gulish Khel, Sheijan,101 CAS Infa rud flow the Lake of Enzelli, and the Suf^d Rud, Sliimerud, Langarud, Shalmon, Belisar, Norud, Garason, Pul-i-rud, Gazi rud, Larthijan, Mazi rud, Sirkerrehrud, Hassanabad, Usian, Miandeh rud, are also in Ghilan, while the Sarkom Atchi rud, Turparu Sarimru, Bor-i-Shi, Nusaru, Kiarleheru, Sher-i-rud, Vashek, Shah Kellan, Mazzur, Til-i-rud, Ukihsar, Izzarud, Pas- sendeh Asp-i-chai, Leizabad, Til-i-rud Palengarud, Kellarurud, Nimakal md, Norud, Rudpesh, Sardab rud, Chalus, Kerparusah, Hari rud Mazike rud, Dusdike rud, Numakab rud, Alam rud, Kalheru, Alam rud Sulerdeh, Rustam rud, Izzutdeh, Haraz, Jorlor, Siaru, Tegin, and the Kulbad are in Mazanderan, and the Chiparkendi, Su-i-mahaleh, Kurd mahaleh ehai, Kora su. Many of these rivers have water in them always, but others are dry, but all are danger ous torrents after rain in the mountains, stopping communication till they subside. Of the West coast I have not much information. Chesney says the coast of DaghistSn is shallow. The Russian Government sends a vessel every year to survey the coast of the Caspian as the soundings are continually altering. The sailors of the Caspian fleet are made to serve alternately in this sea and in the Baltic. The vessels used for the navigation of the Caspian may be divided into five classes according to the character of their build. The first comprises ships that visit all the ports of the Caspian indiscriminately; the second, those that ply only in the neighbourhood of Astrakhan; the third, those that confine themselves to the mouths of the Volga from Astrakhan to the . sea; the fourth, the river boats that never quit the Volga; and the fifth, those belonging to the Persian Provinces. The ships that visit the ports of the Caspian are called ' shkooutes/ and their hulls are not unlike those of Dutch vessels. They are built of bad timber, and in defiance of all rules. Their number, though greatly ex ceeding the demands of commerce, is not above eighty; they gauge from 1,000 to 2,000 hectolitres. Ship-owners generally buy old hulls in Nijni Novgorod, and turn them into ' shkooutes/ without ever reflecting that their craziness and want of regularity makes them exceedingly dangerous as sea going vessels. And then the command of them is given to ignorant pilots, who fill the office of Captains in all but the name. The crews consist of from ten to sixteen, and these being chosen by the sole test of cheapness, the result is that the navigation of the squally and formidable Caspian is in very bad repute among merchants. The ' shkooutes ' are employed in conveying Russian and Persian goods, and the workmen, materials, provisions, and produce, belonging to the fisheries situated between Salian, Siphitourinsk, Akhrabat, and Astarabad, and in carrying victuals and stores to the garrisons in the eastern ports of the Caucasus. Of all these transports, those of the Crown alone afford the shippers any chance of profit. The Russian authorities and merchants themselves confess that there is no longer any thing to be got by conveying merchandise from Astrakhan to Persia. Twenty years ago the freights obtained for heavy goods were from I'SO roubles to 3 per pood, and from 6 to 10 roubles for light and bulky goods. Now the freight for the former does not exceed from 40 to 70 copeks, and that of the latter never amounts to one rouble. The return charges cannot be stated with accuracy, since they depend on the quantity of goods to be shipped, and the number of vessels ready toMMOHMHnHI ' CAS load. It often happens that tlie Captains put up their services to auction, and end with losing instead of gaining. This diminution in the charges for freight is evidently the consequence of the superabundance of vessels, of the frequent shipwrecks which cause a preference for land carriage, and of the small amount of importation into the Persian Provinces. The vessels that ply on the Caspian in the vicinity of Astrakhan are known in the country by the name of f razchiva/ They differ very little from the shkooutes, and cost from 1,500 to 4,000 roubles. Sailors distin guish them into two classes, Mangishlaks and Aslams, the former of which take the name from the port whence they formerly carried to Astrakhan the goods brought by the Khiva and Bokhara caravans. This traffic was monopolised by Tartars, who alone had nothing to fear from the Khirghisand r J urkmans, when they landed. In 18^2 there were but eight manghishlaks, half of which were unemployed. These little vessels carrv from 700 to 1,200 hectrolitres. ^ The other class of razchivas, designated by the Tartar word aslam, are used to convey household vessels, victuals, timber, and articles requisite for the fisheries. They ply to Kisliar, Gourief, and Tchetchenzes, and traverse all the north-western parts of the Caspian, from the Volga to Terek, their principal cargoes being commissariat scores for the troops in the Caucasian provinces.^ They bring back wine, rice, and Kisliar brandy, which is much esteemod in the country. The number of these razchivas does not, however, exceed fifty. They can make five trips in the year. These vessels are much more profitable to their owners than are 'shkooutes/ In reality they are but coasters, and as they seldom venture out of sight of the shore they are much less exposed to wreck. Moreover, in addition to their Astrakhan freights, they keep up an exchange trade in eatable commodities with the nomads of the Caspian shores. They are also employed in the fisheries of the Emba and of Tchetchenze, though the fishermen generally prefer smaller vessels. I he vessels^ that ply in the mouths of the Volga are some of them decked, some open. The former, which need to be of a certain strength, carry goods directly on board the 'shkooutes' in the offing, whereas the latter stop a distance from the mouth of the river. Both are really lighters. The water is so low near the mouths of the Volga, as well as in all the northern part of the Caspian, that the 'shkooutes' are obliged to put to sea empty from the port of Astrakhan. About twenty miles from the shore they take in half their cargo, which is brought to them in open lighters, nor can they complete their loading until they are 100 or 120 miles from the embouchure, where they are met by decked vessels whose draught of water does not exceed thirteen feet. The lighters generally belong to petty Captains who realise a good profit by them, but a large proportion of them are lost every year. The boats that float down the \ olga to Astrakhan from the interior are of extreme diversity of construc tion. 1 he most remarkable are the Kladnyas, which are distinguished above all the rest by their solidity and their Dutch build. They have but one enormously tall mast with two sails, one of which is attached to a boom twice as long as the hull of the vessel. Next after them come the beliangs, flat boats built entirely of deal, and not pitched either within or without. Besides these there are an infinity of smaller boats, which it is unnecessary to describe. All these boats convey goods from Astrakhan to Mijm Novgorod, Saratof, and other places, and vice versa, charging for 102103 CAS freight from ten to thirty kopeks per pood, according- to distance. They arrive at Astrakhan at stated times, namely in May, July, and September. The steam-boat that makes trips every year between Astrakhan and Nijni Novgorod takes from forty to fifty days to ascend the river, and a fortnig-ht to return. The navig-ation of the Volga appears by sailors^ accounts to be growing more difficult every year ; some parts of the river are already impracticable for boats of a certain draught. Indeed the fact seems clearly ascertained that the Volga has undergone a great diminution of volume within the last century. The vessels belonging to the Persian provinces resemble the Russian shkooutes, with this difference that no pitch is used in their construction, but their timbers are so accurately joined as to admit no water. It is super fluous to say that the Persian shipping is in a still worse position than that of Russia. If to these statistical details we add that all the Russian goods are conveyed by land to the Caucasian provinces of the empire, no more will be wanting to show how deserted is the Caspian sea. The Russian mercan tile marine is said to amount to about 1,000 vessels of all descriptions, the limited trade of this sea not requiring so many freights are exceedingly low. I have little information of the strength of the fleet kept on the Caspian by the Russians. Kastwick saw, at Ashurada alone, eight war-steamers capable of transporting 500 men each, five new sloops which could contain 200 men each, and six merchant steamers, on each of which 500 men could embark. Besides these there were other transports capable of holding 2,000 men more, so that at least, the means of transporting 10,000 men on the Caspian are always available. But even were we possessed of correct returns of the numbers of vessels at present on the Caspian, it is evident they could be of no service; as the water communication with the Baltic Bay is open the whole way, any number of gun-boats could be thrown into that sea with out difficulty. The Persians have no vessels whatever on the Caspian, though Holmes mentions having met an individual with the title of Daria Begi of the Caspian, Pall Mall Gazette of 6th April 1871 gives the following information of the Caspian fleet. Its head-quarters are on the Bay of Krasnovodsk and off the island of Ashurada. It consists of one paddle steamer, two steam schooners, one screw gun-boat, four steam launches, one schooner, two lighters and the total marine force attached to the schooner is 73 staff and superior officers and 906 subordinates. The Caspian is exceedingly prolific in fish. The waters in which the fish ing is carried on are private property, or farmed out by the Crown and the towns, or they are free to all comers. The most productive spots belong to the princes Kourakin, Youssoupof, Besborodoko, &amp;c. The Crown fisheries were formerly commercial property; they are now leased to one individual, along with those belonging to the district capitals of the Government of Astrakhan. The waters of Astrakhan, though belonging to Prince Kourakin, have nevertheless been gratuitously conceded to the town. They yield for the most part only small kinds of fish, which are consumed by the inhabitants themselves. The fisheries of the Emba have been free since 1803. They comprise 300 miles of the Caspian coast, from the mouth of the Ural to Mentooi Koultouk, and take their name from the river Emba. They belonged formerly to the Counts Koutosof and Soltykov.104 CAS By virtue of a decree^ dated 31st March 1803, fishery of all sorts, includ ing- that of seals, is free in the maritime waters of Tchetchenze. The island of that name, lying- not far from the Gulf and Cape of Ag-rakhan, contains vast establishments for smoking-, salting 1 , and drying fish, and numerous dwellings occupied by the fishermen. The fishery here lasts all the year through, and yields beluga, common sturgeon, salmon, trout, silurus, and two varieties of carp. It has been the custom of the seal-fishers from time immemorial not to destroy any of those animals before the 13th of April; whoever infringes this rule is deprived of all his booty by his comrades, who divide it among themselves. War is waged upon the seals in five different ways. In summer they are hunted on the islands and netted in the sea; in winter they are shot, or killed with clubs on the ice, or at the breathing holes they break through it. In summer the seals weigh thirty pounds, in autumn about sixty, and in winter often ninety-six The permanent fisheries are called vataghis and outshoughis; the places where they are temporary are called stania. An outshoughi consists in a barrier of stakes planted across the river, and sometimes wattled. Below this barrier the apparatus called in Russian samoloff is placed in the current. It is a cord hung with short lines and hooks, and the business of the fisherman consists in examining the lines, and taking off the fish that are hooked. These are immediately taken to a shed built on piles at the waterside, where they are cut up; the roes, the fat, and the nerves are afterwards conveyed to places where they undergo the processes necessary to fit them for commerce. As the lines of stakes hinder the fish from ascending the river, the Gov ernment has for some time prohibited the use of outshoughis, and also of the lines and hooks, by which it is found that scarcely one fish is taken out of a hundred that swallow the bait; the rest escape though wounded, and thus perish uselessly. The invention of these barriers is ascribed to the Tartars of Astrakhan. As fish was an important article of commerce between them and the Russians, it may be presumed that they adopted this means to keep the fish from ascending to the upper portions of the Volga. The vataghis, usually placed on the heights above the shore, are cellars in which fish is salted and dried. Before the door there is always a platform sheltered by a screen of reeds, where the fish are cut up and cleaned. Nets, some of them several hundred yards in length, are exclusively used in these establishments. It is forbidden, however, to stretch them across the entire width of the river. The fishing season is divided into several distinct periods. The first, which extends from March till May, that is from the breaking up of the ice to the time of flood, is called the caviare season; it is the most important and most productive of the caviare and isinglass. The second occurs in July when the waters have sunk within their ordinary bed, and the fish having spawned are returning to the sea. The third, from September to Novem^ ber, is the season when the beluga, sturgeon, and sevringa return to the deepest parts of the river. These fish are also taken in winter by nets of a peculiar form. At that time of year the fishermen of the coasts often travel over the ice for dozens of miles from the land. Every two men have a horse and sledge, and cany with them 3,000 yards of net, with which theyCAS—CAU capture belugas, sturgeons, silures, and even seals under the ice. These expeditions are very dangerous. The wind often drives the iee-bloeks on a sudden out to sea, and then the loss of the fishermen is inevitable, unless the wind chops round and drives them back to land. Old experienced fish ermen allege that the instinct of the horses forewarns them of these atmos pheric changes, and that their uneasiness puts their masters on their guard against the danger; according to the same authorities, the moment the animals are yoked they turn of their own accord towards the shore, and set off thither with extraordinary speed. The fishermen of Astrakhan reckon three classes of fish. Ihe first they call red fish, which includes the beluga, the sevringa, and the sturgeon. The second consist of white fish, such as the salmon trout, the bast ird beluga, the sterlet, the carp or sazan, the soudak, and the silure. To the third class belong all those designated by the general name of tchistia, kooaya or riba, either on account of the closeness of the nets employed to take them, or of their habits of en tering rivers in very dense shoals. They are small fish, which are little prized, and are salted for the consumption of the interior of the empire. The Government fishing board has the general control of the fisheries, gi'ants the requisite licences, superintends the election of the headmen, sends out inspectors to maintain order, and collects information as to the produce of the fisheries. In 1828, 8,887 men employed in fishing, and 25 1 in taking seals, with 3,219 boats, brought in 43,033 sturgeons, 053,164 sevringas, and 23,069 belugas : these yielded 330 tons of caviare and about 34 tons of isinglass. There were also taken 8,335 soudaks, and the enormous quantity of 98,584 seals. The sturgeon fishery alone produces about 2,000,000 of rubles annually, but the expenses are very considerable. Ihe revenue deriv ed by the Government from the fisheries of the V olga amounts to 800,000 paper rubles. It is noteworthy that the Caspian is as above stated connected with the Baltic. There are three series of canals which run from the Caspian to Iver and Lake Ladoga, the Vyash nevolotskia, the likoinskaya and the Marunskaya. Bythis route vessels could go from Ashurada to London with out one single break.— (Imperial Gazetteer'—Kichivald llohnes Abbott F de Hell, fyc.) CAUCASUS—Lat. Long. Elev. An extensive and lofty range of mountains, the centre chain ot which stretches north-west to south-east for about 700 miles between the Black Sea and the Caspian, and there forms the boundary between Europe and Asia. From the central chain numerous branches are thrown off. One of them to the north proceeds through the Government of C aucasus into Astrakhan, and onward to the banks of the A olga, while the branches to the south traverse the greater part of the Government of Georgia, and in the south of that Government link on with the mountains of Ararat. 1 he highest point in the range is Mount Elbruz, which stands near the middle of the central chain, and has an altitude of about 18,000 feet. Ihe next highest is Mount Kasbek, 16,000 feet, across which is the celebrated^ K'g Pass, which gives Russia her only carriage communication with her Irans- Caucasian domains. The north side of the range is much more abrupt than the south. Great part of the mountains still remains to be geologically examined, but an admirable section is furnished by the Eng Pass, and 105 otfrf Mil —I llllJikJL 1 CxVU has been fully described, particularly by W'agiier, who not only travelled over it, but resided several months among- the mountains of Kasbek, and ascended them to the limit of perpetual snow. According to him, stratified rocks appear at the bottom of the mountains, and rise to a considerable height on their sides. These rocks consist chiefly of thick beds of limestone, conglome rate, and clay slate. Higher up are seen immense crystalline masses composed of granite, sienite, serpentine, and gabronite. These masses, though higher in position, are evidently lower in the geological series than the stratified rocks, which in many places have been upheaved by them, and in consequence have a considerable dip. Highest of all is trachytic porphyry, which forms the great body of all the principal summits of the central range. That this trachyti is the most recent of all the rocks is proved by the fact, that in many places it is seen piercing them, and throwing them into the wildest con fusion. Judging from the composition and general appearance of these great trachytic masses, Humboldt and other celebrated geologists are of opinion the Caucasus and all the loftiest summits of the great mountain ranges of both hemispheres were upheaved contemporaneously, and within a comparatively recent period. The limit of perpetual snow in the Caucasus is 11,000 feet, and hence, as some of the mountains rise from 5,000 to nearly 7,000 feet above this, there is an extensive range for glaciers. It would seem, however, that the supply of moisture which the atmosphere affords is far less than might have been anticipated. Scarcely a single lake of any extent is to be found in the Caucasus, and the scenery thus remains destitute of that which constitutes one of the most magnificent features in the Alps of Switzerland. In height and magnitude, Mont Blanc must yield to many mountains of the Caucasus, but in all the other essentials of sublimity, it still remains unrivalled. Numerous cascades tumble down the north steeps of the Caucasus, but none of them are remarkable either for volume or height, and the only rivers of any consequence which are fed by them are the Terek, Kuban, and Kur. The minerals of the Caucasus, so far as may be judged from the very imperfect examination of them which has been made, are not of great value. It was at one time supposed that gold abounded, but a worthless material of the same colour, called cat gold, appears to have been mistaken for it. The only mineral which has yet been ascertained to exist in such quantities as to make it capable of being worked to profit is lead. Vegetation is very vigorous. Magnificent forest trees clothe the higher mountain slopes almost to an incredible height; lower down all the finer fruit trees of the climate are found growing in wild luxuriance, while lower still, where human labour can be made available, almost any degree of culture, however imperfect, is rewarded with an abundant crop. The ordinary cereals grow 7,000 feet above sea level, while abundant shrubs, plants, and flowers, in almost endless variety, deck the valleys and lower plains. Animal is not less vigorous than vegetable life, and the foi'ests abound with almost every species of game— among quadrupeds, wolves, boars, jackals, deer, goats and hares—among birds, pheasants and partridges. A large species of wild cattle, called acrroche roam at large, and the hares of the Caucasus have been famed from the remotest antiquity. The inhabitants include a great variety of tribes, the principal of which are the Tcherkesses or Circassians, Georgians, Ossett-s, Lesghians, and Abkasses. Evidently derived from a variety of stocks, and speaking a variety of languages, they are all distinguished by one noble 106107 CAU—CHA quality, an almost extinguisbable love of freedom, and in bodily constitution are at once so robustly and so elegantly framed, that what is'known as the Caucasian race is universally acknowledged to be the finest physical type of man— f Wagner—Koch.) CAUCASUS—Lat. Long. Elev. A Government of Russia, bounded on the north by the Government of the Don Cossacks and Astrakhan, east by the Caspian Sea, south by Circassia, and west by the Cossacks of the Black Sea; its greatest length, north-west to south-east, is about 380 miles; greatest breadth, north to south, 170 miles. It is traversed north to south near its centre by a low ramification of the Caucasus Mountains, but with this exception, the surface is flat, consisting generally of an alluvion, which towards the east appears to be of very recent formation. It is not traversed by any river of importance (the Kuma, since the lower part of its course was last in the sand, no longer deserves the name), but is watered on part of its north frontier by the Maritsch, and on the south by the Kuban and Terek. The climate is in general very mild, and there are some fertile tracts particularly in the neigh bourhood of the Terek, but great part of the alluvial flats is covered with salt pools and marshes, which make the soil, when they prevail, altogether unfit for cultivation. The injury is, in some measure, compensated by the large quantities of excellent salt which is obtained from them. Some of the steppes yield tolerable pasture, on which numerous herds of cattle are reared. The chief products of the soil are corn, including maize and wine. The mullberry thrives well, and considerable attention has recently been paid to the rearing of silk-worms. Bees also are carefully attended to, and the honey and wax obtained from them forms a considerable article of export. Owing to the neighbourhood of the warlike mountaineers of the Caucasus, a considerable army is always maintained within the Government, and most of its towns are fortified. The capital is Georgievsk; population 520,400.— (Imperial Gazeteer.) CHALDEANS— A tribe of Christians, who inhabit a portion of the Hakkari district of » Kurdistan. The Kaldani (as they are called) according to their own accounts were converted to Christianity by St. Thomas and two of the seventy disciples. By means of a rigidly enforced system of exclusion, they have preserved their freedom as a republic; their religious tenets and simple liturgy have also remained nearly unchanged since the moment that the blessings of the Gospel were introduced into their secluded valleys. Almost every village has its priest, and likewise a church of peculiar simplicity, in which, a little before daylight and fasting, the Kalnani of each sex assemble on Sunday for divine worship. It is a vaulted building, without steeple or belfry, and sometimes in front of a cave. Its interior walls are covered with printed calico, and it is without seats, images, pictures, or ornaments of any kind; the whole complement of the service consists of manuscript copies of the New Testament and liturgy, a brass cross (different from ours), a small bell, a copper chalice and paten, with an incense chafing- dish. Having purified their hands in the smoke of frankincense issuing from the last mentioned vessel, the priest, clothed in wide trowsers, a shirt, and a cotton surplice, administers to each individual the sacred elements of bread and wine: he then proceeds, in Chaldee, with the ritual which108 CTIA concludes the service, and the people kiss the minister's hand as they retire to the dwellings : there is, besides, another sacrament, that of baptism. Fasts are frequently kept, and all kinds of meat are strietly prohibited to the clergy after ordination; but celibacy is not enjoined on the priests, bishops, or patriarch. The last dignity, with its temporal and spiritual power, is hereditary. A constant state of warfare, or of preparation to resist attacks, has rendered the Chaldean ferocious towards enemies, and even towards peaceable strangers; but the knowledge of Christianity, imperfect as it is in that country, has, notwithstanding this and other faults, made him superior to the Asiatics of the same class who follow the Mahamadan creed. The hardy life of the mountaineer has produced in him an open and erect bear ing ; and he is courageous and revengeful abroad, although kind and cordial at home. The women are neither covered like other easterns, nor secluded from social intercourse. The men are loosely clad, wearing sandals of chamois skin, and a peaked woollen cap, behind which their hair falls in one plaited tress. The diet of the people is almost entirely vegetable; their houses are scattered along the sides of the mountains, amidst groups of fruit and other trees and are clean and commodious. But in summer time they remove their families to sleep on an elevated platform, inclosed like an immense bedstead. By a natural mistake, the Chaldeans have been confounded with a schis matic branch, who, to the great annoyance of those who considered them selves the orthodox party, adopted, and have preserved the doctrines of Nestorius. The remarkable country of the Kaldani stretches eastward of the district of Amddia, between Lake Van and the Taurus; in the interior are terraces cultivated with rice or grain, with a succession of deep, dark, wooded valleys, between the high and rugged Alpine ranges of Julamerik, the Jawur lagh, and other chains, which rise to the uplands, situated beyond the backbone of Kurdistan. {Ainsworth.)

The Chetchens inhabit the country along the banks of the Terek, and having within the last 100 years become converts to the Mahamadan faith, they used to plunder their pagan brethren without scruple or mercy, and it was through their country which adjoins the little Kabarda that the Lesghi used to carry their slaves to the gi*eat mart of Anapa. The Chetchens, were always the most determined of the foes of Russia, and although General \ermaloff drove them from the Tulk behind the Soudya, they never lost an opportunity of attacking the Russian post, and extended their excursions to the gates of Kislai. Their numbers did not exceed 20,000 families, but they reeeived assistance from all the Mahamadan tribes, particularly the Lesghis, which enabled them to bring a far greater number of men into the field than their own limited population admitted of. 1 heir country is thickly wooded, very strong, and produces enough grain for their own consumption, but in winter their cattle are obliged to descend into the plains, and in the war with Russia, being unable to avail themselves of their own lands on the banks of the Terek, they were necessitated to purchase pasture from the tribes of Yaken and Kamuk. Wagner has the following interesting information regarding this tribe :—The Tschetschensians were at the head of the resistance to the northern aggressor in the Eastern Caucasus, in the same way that the Circassians formed the nucleus of opposition in the western Caucasus, whilst the smaller or tamer tribes of the Abchasians, Ubiches, Tschigetians, Tartars of the Elbrus110 cue (Karatscliai), and the Kabardans, related with the Adig'he by blood and tongue, rallied round them. The term Tschetschensians is only strictly applicable to a small clan of this people, which however became so very prominent by its boldness and energy, that the Russians designated the whole people by this appellation. Though including the Kists and Ingusches, which are related to them, the whole tribe of genuine Tschetschensians does not exceed 150,000 souls. The clan is called Midschegi by the Circassians, Tartars, and Lesghians. The extremely uncouth idiom of the Tschets chensians has nothing in common, either with the Circassian idiom, nor with that of the Lesghians, or that of the Tartars and Ossetians, though single words may in some cases have been imported from the different Caucasian idioms into the Tschetschensian tongue. Klaproth represents it as perfectly independent and original in its structure, adding, however, that it has adopted many terms from the language of the neighbouring tribe of Avars. The historical origin of the Tschetschensians is involved in the deepest obscurity. They are regarded as the aborigines of the Caucasian isthmus, who, like the other nations inhabiting ' the craggy citadel of the Caucasus,' have preserved the uncouth customs and military spirit of their ancestors, and they are still as in the time of (Eschylus. The Tschetschensians inhabit the beautiful mountain district between the high Caucasian chain and the Terek. Their territory is limited to the east ward by the Koissu, to the westward by the pass leading from Vladikankas to Trans-Caucasus. This mountain district abounds in magnificent forests and pasturages, but the lofty situation of the valleys in the Tschetschensian territory only admits of scanty harvests of corn. Nevertheless, harvest time is an important season for the mountaineers, who used commonly to remain very quiet till the grain was carried and stacked. When late in the autumn, the hayricks had disappeared from the fields, and the raging waters of the Terek and Sundscha had fallen, it was well known along the Cossack line that no great interval would elapse ere the warlike Tschetschen sian yell would be heard. The Russian posts situated in the Terek plains from Vladikankas to Vnesapnaja, and exposed to the incursions of the Tschetschensians, Vladikankas, Grosnaja, Girselaul, and Temirchantschura, were the chief centres of Russian operations against the Tschetschen sians. The Tschetschensians are less pleasing than the Circassians, whom they resemble in their spare figures, bold carriage, and aquiline noses, but without having an identical expression of the whole face. In the counte nance of the Circassian Usdens there prevails a frank, open, dashing, and somewhat wild expression, and their beai'ing is so chivalrous that you cannot look at these bandit chiefs without pleasure. A greater energy, and a more sinister and threatening character prevails in the more swarthy faces of the Tschetschensians. Men may be seen amongst them, whose eyes flash with a cunning and sanguinary spirit that terrifies. One can safely accept the hospitality and friendship of a Circassian Usden, but one would not venture to accede to the invitation of a Tschetschensian to visit his aoul. The faces of the Tschetschensian are, generally speaking, somewhat thinner and longer than those of the Circassians; their black beards are more scanty than with other orientals, e.g., the Turks and the Arabs. Their costume, however, appears to be common to all the tribes of the Caucasus; scanty brown breeches, brown coats, with a leathern belt round their hips, and with party coloured pockets on both sides of the breast, where they keep their111 CUE—CUT cartridges. Their head is adorned with the Caucasian turban, a great cap variegated at the top, with a broad tur brim, which, slouching down over the forehead, increases the wild and sinister character of the physiognomies of these mountaineers. All wear broad kinschals in their belt, and many of them a long pistol slung over their back. Some chieftains are much moye richly clothed; they wear coats with silver embroidery, and splendid daggers and swords with silver handles. 1 he faithful observance of oaths is not so common among the Tschetschensians; they treat their prisoners with greater severity, and they are moreover animated with a religious fanaticism, unknown to the Circassians, 1 he ^ f01 mei hatred of liussian supremacy among the Tschetschensians found its chief lever in the glowing fanaticism. All great leaders of the Tschetschensians from Shekh MansOr, who knew twenty thousand spiritual verses by heart, down to Schamyl, Chief of the Tschetschensians, who played the part of a prophet, felt the necessity of basing their secular power on the religious fanaticism of their people, just as Abdel-kader did in Algeria. This religious fanaticism in the Eastern Caucasus facilitated the cohesion of tribes speaking different idioms, under one head, and impeded for a long time the progress of conquest to the numerous Russian hosts.— {Monteith— Wagner.)

The name means ' extinguishers of the light/ These people, says Rich, are dispersed throughout the Turkish and, 1 believe, Persian dominions. Little or nothing is known of their religious profession except that they are not Mahamadans, from whom they get a variety of names in different places. They are very shy and uncommuni cative, for fear probably of awakening a spirit of active persecution in their masters. Brant says that they dress up a log of wood in fine clothes and pelisses and adore it; when one of their great men dies they inter all his wealth with his body for which reason the Mahamadans frequently desecrate the graves for the sake of what they may find.— [Rich—Brant}) CIIOHAN KOPRI—Lat.

A river of Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the Gaur Tagh to the west of Biburt, and flowing east for 120 miles, as far as the village of Bishanget, then turns north and falls into the sea at Batum in 90 miles, or a course of about 210 miles. There is no mention of it above Artvin, but it appears to receive several important branches above that place. One coming from the north-east of ArzrQm and joining near Bishanget appears to be nearly as large as the main branch, and the Ardonat Su joins it on the right just above Artvin; about six miles below Artvin it is joined by a stream called the Ilatil Dara Su coming from the east, 10 miles further down the Marghar Su empties itself and forms the boundaries between the districts of Lazistan and Livaneh, and in one mile further the Itchkaleh Su coming from the west joins the Chorak just above Bortchka. At Majkhal it receives its last tributary of any importance in the Ajara Su coming from the east. Above the bridge just below Artvin, the river is not navigable on account of rocks in the middle of the stream which is there only 15 or 20 yards broad. In many places between Botchka and Artvin the banks of this river rise in abrupt acclivities attaining the eleva tion of mountains, so that the water cannot spread between them. , In the dry season the depth varies from 8 yards 2 feet, and width 40 to 50 yards, but in the melting of the snow it rises perhaps 20 feet, where the bed is confined, and where not so it increases in width 200 yards. Rapids occur at almost every turn below Artvin, near which place there are two or three falls of 1 ^to 2 feet; the frequent occurrence of these requires very expert manage ment on the part of the boatmen, who, however, are generally very skilful. The total number of boats employed on the Chorak river is about 80, of these Botchka furnishes 30, Maradit 20, and other places 30 more. The boats used are flat-bottomed, about 50 feet long, sharp at both ends, 4 to 5 feet broad in the centre drawing 15 to 18 inches, when they are fully laden, and carrying six to eight tons weight. At present the boats are chiefly employed113 CHO—CIR in transporting bricks, tiles, and lime.

The geology of Circassia, where not included in that of Caucasus (which see) is very im- perfectlv known. Hich beds of iron exist, but have not been turned to account. Traces of copper and lead have also been discovered; and, in some districts, coal not only is found, but is said to be partially worked, and used for fuel. Circassia abounds in mountain torrents; but none of its streams deserve the name of river, if we except the Kuban and Terek, which both rise within it, and are indebted to it for almost all their affluents, but acquire no importance till they reach its frontiers. The natural vegetation of Circassia is vigorous and luxuriant. Reference has already been made to the magni ficent mountain forests. Some of these extend into the lower grounds, and there have a rank undergrowth which becomes almost impenetrable; and while blocking up all ordinary means of traffic compensates for the evil by furnishing admirable means of defence against hostile attacks. The wild animals, though perhaps not so various in kind as might be anticipated in such circumstances, are very numerous, and consist chiefly of bears, wolves, foxes, and hogs. Various kinds of deer abound, and the reedy marshes along the banks of the Kuban are said to be haunted by the elk. Eagles are often seen, and the part of the country washed by the Black Sea is the resort of numerous flocks of swans and geese. Among smaller birds, the nightingale occasionally is heard; but many others, as the black bird and thrush, though abundant, and externally the same as our own well- known songsters, appear to have lost their notes. A few fish are taken on the coast, and most of the mountain streams are well supplied with trout. Where the surface is sufficiently level to admit of cultivation, the soil is generally a deep rich loam, with a substratum of limestone or chalk. The implements and mode of cultivation are very defective; but corn and wine, and all the ordinary productions of temperate climates are freely raised. The crop most extensively grown is millet, the flour of which, made into porridge, may be regarded as the national diet. The horses, though gene rally small, are active, sure-footed, quick-eyed and remarkably sagacious. Almost every Circassian has his horse, and tends it with a care hardly sur passed by that which is paid by the Arab of the desert to his steed. Both cattle and sheep are extensively reared; but the domestic animal existing in greatest numbers is the goat, which grows up with almost no care, browsing on the twigs and undergrowth of the forests. Agricul ture and the rearing of cattle seem to be the only industrial occupa tions. There are no manufactures in the proper sense of the term. The only thing approaching to them are the scanty products of a few individuals employed as a kind of ornamental silversmiths, gun and sword- smiths, cartwrights and coopers. It is said, however, that there is no lack of domestic industry; and that while the males are occupied with the labours of the field, the females are busily engaged, not only in ordinary household work, but in carrying wool, hemp, and flax through all their various pro cesses up to the finished garment, weaving and tailoring included. The115 cm trade is almost as nominal as the manufactures. When it has any exist ence, it is only as barter, money being almost unknown, an ox or cow form ing 1 the ordinary standard of value. The country, however, is by no means destitute of materials for export. It has ample supplies of excellent oak tim ber, and could furnish considerable quantities of honey, wax, tallow, hides, and furs. Of the last indeed, a beautiful pitch-fur is sent to Constantinople and much valued for pelisses. To Constantinople also were formely sent Circassian slaves, both male and female; the former used to recruit the corps of Mamelukes in Egypt, and the latter, chiefly natives of Georgia, Immerita, and Mingrelia, supplied the harems of wealthy Turks. The eastern part of Circassia is visited by Armenian traders. But the chief interest connected with Circassia is not of a commercial nature. It seems to be universally admitted that its people exhibit man in his finest physical form, and are the original stock from which the races now dominant throughout the civilized world were derived. In consequence of this, everything connected with them, their shape and features, their man ners, institutions, and general history have justly engaged a far greater de gree of attention than the extent of their country, and even the heroic achievements, of which they have made it the theatre, could have otherwise deserved. Unfortunately, in regard to many points, the difficulty of enquiry is as great as its importance. Although the different tribes inhabiting Circassia bear a striking resem blance to each other, both externally and in habits and customs, they differ widely in language. Within a narrow space, not less than 72 dialects have been counted, and one particular spot, where this variety is more remarkably exhibited, has been surnamed by Abulfeda, ' Jabl-al-Alason' (the Mount of Tongues.) To add to the perplexity, none of their languages have a written character, while their pronunciation consists of strange, uncouth, deep, guttural sounds, which European letters can hardly express, and European organs vainly attempt to articulate. In external form the Circassians are of middle stature, broad shouldered, but otherwise rather slimly made, with small hands and feet, and keen lively eyes. Their hair is of all colours, but reddish is the most prevalent. Blue eyes are more common than any other colour. They are not in general very fair, though some among them are eminently so and a good complexion is not at all uncommon. Their bearing is manly and dignified, but they have a kind of lofty gait, which perhaps indicates, and at all events may easily be mistaken for, haughtiness. They rarely sit cross-legged or on their heels, preferring to sit like Europeans on cushions. They eat as the Turks do seated at a tray placed on a stool. They never move without arms, considering it effeminate to appear unprovided with means of defence. Their tempers are excellent, they are not easily roused to anger, and they are quickly pacified. Conversation is one of their chief amusements, and they indulge in it freely. They may be divided into two great classes, the Circassians Proper or the Cherkass and the Chechens. They take the common name of Adighe, but the former, occupying the west part of the Caucasus, and including among them smaller tribes of Khabardians, Abkasses, Ubiches, r lschigetes, &amp;c., amount to 400,000 or 500,000 souls, while the latter, occupying the east parts, have probably risen, by their own energy and116 CIR t prowess, from a comparatively feeble stock, and now amount to about 150,000, thus making the whole population not to exceed 650,000, a number roughly, but apparently fairly, estimated by Wagner, though Mr. Bell tries to prove that it cannot fall short of a million. The Circassians are divided into four different classes, which are ranged under each other in a manner which bears some resemblance to our feudal system. At the head, stand the Princes or Pschis, who are independent of each other, and have no common head unless when on great emergencies they concur in appointing one. Their rank is hereditary, and they are particularly careful to preserve it untainted by intermarrying only with families which possess it. Hence this class is considered to furnish the best specimens of the^ pure Circassian stock. Under each Pschi are, I., Usdis or nobility ; II., Tschfo- kotes or freemen; III., Pschilf, serfs. Beneath all these, though their unfortunate position scarcely allows them to be regarded as a class, are slaves. Each prince, though nominally independent, is by no means despotic. The extent of his powers is well understood, and any attempt to overstretch them would be at once resisted by the nobility, at least, in so far as their own privileges were affected. Of the privileges of those below them they might not be so careful, and the oppression of the serfs or Psehilt, by both princes and nobles, is by no means un common. Serfs are numerous, a rich man having often 50 or 60 male slaves. In external appearance there is no difference perceptible between them and other Circassians. In colour they are the same as well as in courage and other qualities. Slaves may sit and eat in an assembly of &gt;»• the higher classes and they carry arms, but the Tschfokotes or freemen, the most numerous class of all, well deserve the name, and have both power and spirit sufficient to maintain their position. The Circassians are civilized enough to live in towns, but the nature of the country, combined with other causes, induces them to prefer hamlet or single homesteads often widely scattered. The houses are generally of a very humble description; they are almost invariably of one story. The better description are built of wood, but the greater part have merely a framework of wood, filled up with clay, and in many cases are of clay throughout. The interior is corresponding. There is no decoration, and scarcely anything which deserves the name of furniture. A kind of bench raised above the surface, and often covered with mats, forms what is called the Divan, and there the inmates sit, eat, and sleep. The imper fect accommodation thus provided is partly explained by the fact, that the Circassian spends the greater part of his time in the open air, and there, not in his house, finds his home. In domestic life, the Circassian is very much of a Turk. His authority in his own house is absolute. His wife must hide her self from strangers, and not walk out without being veiled. His children must stand in his presence, and when they eat go into a corner and turn their backs. The best feature in the domestic arrangement is that there is no harem, and polygamy is almost unknown. Still, so long as public law values the life of a woman at half that of a man, and he sells his daughter, not only to the countryman who honestly takes her for his wife, but some times to the trader who means to make a speculation of her charms, without questioning the truth of all that is said of his manliness, generosity, courage, and love of freedom, it is impossible to deny that, in many essen tial respects, he is more than half a savage.117 r cm However, there is one fact which shows that the freedom of the women is more real than nominal; a young man eloping- with a girl with her own con sent is a common occurrence. Her father can make no complaint as if the girl's parents are but slaves. She has the disposal of herself, but he can exact from the lover the full amount of her value, and the elders settle what that value shall be. The religion of the Circassians exhibits a strange jumble of Christianity, Mahamadanism, and Paganism. The first, unfortunately, has scarcely a nominal existence, and is chiefly discernible in a superstitious reverence paid to the cross, figures of which, in stone, are set up in many localities, which in consequence often become famous trysting places, and at which some kind of worship is paid. There are some Christians of Greek or Armenian descent, but they are almost wholly Circassianised; their language, dress, and customs are Circassians. The paganism appears in the homage which is paid, chiefly by the vulgar, to two spirits, a good and a bad,—Merem, a benevolent deity, and Tschible, the spirit of thunder. Mahamadanism exists in a more definite form, and in some districts considerable influence is possessed by its priests. Sums by persuasion, who, in addition to their proper duties, act as teach ers, and keep schools, in which, as there is no printed vernacular, Turkish, and occasionally a little Persian, are taught. The true Circassian education is that which the youths receive who are trained to war from their earliest years, and never cease from it till they are able to take the field. The Circassians having no annals, and very few traditions, their early his tory is almost a blank. Much ingenuity and labour have been employed in endeavouring to trace their origin through the affinities of language. The success as yet has been very partial, but there can be no doubt that they come from the east, and the probability is that they were originally Medes. From them Greece received her first inhabitants, and in return appears to have sent back colonists, who settled on the Circassian coast, and ultimately fell under the Roman domination. In more modern times, between the 10th and 13th centuries, they became subject to the kingdom of Georgia, whose Queen, Tamer, is said to have spread a knowledge of Christianity among them. In 1424 they threw off the Georgian yoke, asserted their indepen dence, and not only maintained it, but extended their boundaries so far, that they were at last brought into fierce conflict with the Tartars, who ultimately prevailed and made the Circassians their tributaries. They continued so till 1705, when they rose against their oppressors and, by a decisive victory, effected their freedom. In 1781 Russia acquired the Kuban as a frontier; and, in 1784, the Turks built the fort Anapa, and thence directed their efforts to stir up the Circassians against the Czar. Anapa, taken by the Russians in 1797, was restored to Turkey in 1812, at the peace of Bucharest. The quiet which followed this Treaty was used by the Turks to convert the Cir cassians to Islamism, and thus implant in them an ever enduring enmity to Russia. In 1829, Anapa again fell into the hands of the Russians; and by the Treaty of Adrianople, they also acquired all the other Turkish possessions on this coast. Upon this they ground their claims of sovereignty over Circassia, which in fact was never under Turkish rule. The claim is indignantly scouted by the Circassians, who for many years have not only kept the Russian armies at bay but inflicted a series of defeats, as honor able to the victors, as humiliating and disastrous to their foes.118 • cm The following extracts from Wagner's Georgia^ Persia, give some informa tion of this people :— The Western Caucasus and the Pontian coast, from the mouth of the Kuban to that of the Rian, is inhabited by highland tribes, which are gene rally known by the common name of Circassians, but which present marked differences as regards language. The Adighe are the most numerous of these tribes, residing on the left bank of the Kuban, as far as the Russian Fort Golovinski. These are the people who are especially distinguished among the Russians, as well as the Turks, by the name of Circassians, a term of Turkish origin, unknown to the inhabitants themselves. The genuine Adighe must be seen on the Kuban ; it is here that you find the most splendid representatives of that tribe. The Psadooks to the south of Ekaterinodar, and still more the Shap- sooks whose abode is situated a few miles beyond the Kuban, and extends as far as the most northern declivity of the highest chain, belong to the handsomest of the iribes, and are supposed, together with the Kabardans, to speak the purest dialect of the Adighe language. Granted that those who expect to find ideals of manly beauty throughout these tribes will be often greatly disappointed. For even among the Circassians, the great body of the people consists of additions from other races, of vassals and slaves of noblemen, whose origin cannot be easily ascertained, but who are pro bably the descendants of prisoners, or of subjugated tribes. The Circas sian nobles, i.e., Knights, form at most one-fifth, and some well informed Russians, say only one-tenth, of the Adighe people. These men alone have hereditary possessions, slaves, and vote in the deliberative assemblies ; and it is only these, and the still more distinguished mem bers of the princely families (Pschis), who are entitled to the high praise lavished on Circassian beauty. This aristocratic caste despises all connection with a plebeian, even if he is free, and has become rich by trade. The Cir cassian nobleman only courts the daughter of his peer, and preserves thereby the purity of the race, the nobility of blood and person, the beauty of physiognomy, the chivalrous pride of bearing, and a peculiar elegance of movement, manners, and mode of speech. The Circassian Knight is characterized by a personal superiority, which has its origin alike in his mental energy, and in the consciousness of his bodily strength and beauty. This superiority of the pure Circassian betrays itself equally under Muscovite discipline, and in the Musalman east, where the sons of the Caucasus at Cairo as Mamelukes, and at Stambul as Pashas, always played a distinguished part. Even the Turk, who imposes on all other orientals by certain magnanimous qualities, admits the superiority of the Circassian Usdens. Shiel says, there are no towns in Circassia; the villages are built along the coast, but are not very numerous; the houses are dispersed through the forest, which is not thick, and reaches close to the sea. The population is divided into the following classes. Khans, or princes; meerzas, nobles; usdens, gentlemen; ryots, or freemen; and Kienlehs, serfs; besides slaves obtained in war or by purchase. These classes do not intermarry, and, like the castes of India, no man, whatever be his capacity or his deeds, can rise from one class to a higherCIR rank. It is even very rare for one class to buy slaves from another, unless to sell them again. Cireassia, or Adig-ha, as the natives style their country, is divided into six large tribes or confederacies, of which the names are Natch wo, Natakh- wo, KoMee, Sabich, Gwog-hwo, Sotokh; but Kabardah, although the inhabitants resemble the Circassians in language, customs, and manners, does not belong to any of these tribes. These six large tribes are sub-divided into rra term ties, the members of which hold to each other the relations of brother and sister, and therefore cannot intermarry. Serfs are numerous, a rich man having often fifty or sixty male serfs. 1 heir condition seems to be much more analogous with serfdom than slavery. In external appearance there is no difference perceptible between them and other C ircassians. In colour they are the same, as well as in courage and other qualities. Slaves may sit and eat in a mejlis, or society of the hie-her classes, and they carry arms. About half the population consists of Suni Mahamadans. In gene ral they know very little of their religion, and many care very little about the matter. They are equally indifferent to the religion of their neighbours, and usually are willing to give their daughters in marriage to idolaters, who are numerous. These latter appear to believe in God, but they worship trees; at all events, they go through ceremonies under trees. there are some Christians of Greek or Armenian descent, but they are almost wholly Circassianised : their language, dress, customs, are Circassian. I hey can obtain wives from the idolaters; but the Mahamadans would rather give their daughters to the latter, as being real Adlghas, than to these Christians, who are found chiefly in the interior. the mode in which the slave trade with Turkey was carried on is as X) ows 1 arablzun was the principal port from which the merchants came, though they also embarked from Samsun and Sinope, Constantinople, and occasionally irom Egypt. The trade was generally conducted in partnership. ne person supplied the capital, and the profits were equally divided between him and the person who undertook the labour of the voyage to Circassia the capital on an average was about 250^. or 300^. The articles taken to Circassia mostly consisted of silk and cotton-cloths, calicoes, chintzes, cheap shawls a small quantity of gunpowder, and a great deal of salt; also some iuikish coloured leather for slippers and bridles. When the boat arrived at a landing-place it was drawn high up on the s ore to conceal it from the Russians. The merchants then disembarked, and I / ro 1 rn havi ng made previous voyages, they are already provided with a Konak pae, they went at once to their abode; but if not, they inquired for ie best private house, to which they proceeded immediately, and were always welcome. Ihe 'konak pae' is the host. If one were to leave his house for another it would be a mortal offence. It was his duty to protect the person and property of his guest, and he was always ready to lose his lite in their defence. As this was well-known, a traveller once hosted was tolerably safe. After the merchants had landed the people assembled rom the vicinity to hear the news, and to see the novelties from the land oi the Anur-ul-Mohmanin, the Commander of the Faithful, whom they revered. The goods are taken to the ' konak pae's' house, and there e people came with their articles of barter, consisting of honey, butter, tal low, hides, fox-skins, slave-girls and boys, the two latter articles of trade 119120 CIK being, however, kept in another dwelling, while the boatmen purchased grain in exchange for salt, and took it to Turkey. People came from fifty hours' distance to traffic. They were keen in dealing, and never made a bargain without abundance of talking, the profits, after all expenses were paid, amounted generally to twenty-five per cent. Those persons who had slaves for the market did not bring them to the merchants' residence. When the latter had seen the slaves, they retired to another house, leaving the transaction to be completed by a broker. When a Circassian said he had got slaves to sell, the Turk inquired if they were young, and in case of an affirmative answer proceeded to ask how many spans they'were. This referred to height. A girl was considered beyond spanning when she reached six spans j she was then technically said to be ' quarishden chiqdee,' that is, she had passed spanning, and was understood to be twelve years old. Slaves were valued by the number of pieces of silk, chintz, &amp;c., given in exchange for them. i • i Ugly female slaves were purchased for Constantinople, to fill menial or domestic duties. Old women were sometimes sold in Circassia. They were purchased to act as nurses in Constantinople. An old woman was worth two or three thousand ghooroosh (17^. to 25£.) in that city. If among the slaves there were any full-grown men, they were chained or tied lest they should run away, but women were never tied. The mer chants, after the purchase, supplied them with new clothes, the goodness and quality of which depended on the value of the slave. The food given to them was the same as that of the merchants themselves, and there was no limit to the quantity. A great many among the female slaves were glad to leave the country; and some young women, not slaves, who were poor and unprotected, especially orphans, often entreated their relations to sell them. Their hope was that they might be purchased in Constantinople by some wealthy Turk, at the head of whose establishment they might be placed. An orphan girl, at all events, was certain of not changing for the worse. Sometimes a free man was sold by force. He was stolen from some distant place, taken down to the coast, and sold. This did not often happen, and was still more rare with regard to women. Occasionally there was a collusive sale. A man procured a friend to sell him ; he then took to flight, and the amount of the purchase was divided between them. The Circassian girls are not strikingly handsome. They are, however, exceedingly clever and intelligent, readily learning Turkish music and dancing. Their intellectual superiority makes them attractive, and they soon acquire influence in a Turkish family. The Georgian women are hand some, but much inferior in mental qualities, and their market value is in consequence less. • -i £ Prices of course varied at Constantinople according to the vigilance of Russian cruisers, and the incorruptibility of Russian agents at Tarabizun, Samson, and Sinope. The following is the average price in Circassia:— A man of 30 years of age £ 10 20 „ „ 10 to 30 15 „ 30 „ 70 10 „ „ 20 „ 60 5 „ „ 10 „ 30121 Q CIR A woman of 60 years of age £ 10 to 30 40 „ „ 30 „ 40 30 „ „ 40 „ 70 20 to 25 „ „ 50 „ 100 » 14 „ 18 „ „ 50 „ 150 8 „ 12 „ „ 30 „ 80 . ' 0 „ 5 „ „ 20 ,, 40 Hommaire de Hell says :— ' Of all the peoples of the Caucasus none more fully realise than the Cir cassians those heroic qualities with which imagination delights to invest the tribes of these mountains. Courage, intelligence, and remarkable beauty have been liberally bestowed on them by nature; and what I admired above all in their character is a calm, noble dignity that never forsakes them, and which they unite with the most chivalric feeling and the most ardent passion for national liberty. ' The Circassians are in general all well armed. Their equipment consists of a rifle, a sabre, a long dagger, which they wear in front, and a pistol stuck in their belt. Their remarkably elegant costume consists of tight pantaloons, and a short tunic belted round the waist, and having cartridge pockets worked on the breast; their head-dress is a round laced cap, encircled with a black or white border of long wooled sheepskin. In cold or rainy weather they wear a hood (bashlik), and wrap themselves in an impenetrable felt cloak (bourka), Their horses are small, but of astonishing spirit and bottom. It is said that Circassian marauders have got over 25 or even 30 leagues of ground in a night. If pursued by the Russians, the moun taineers are not to be stopped by the most rapid torrents. If the horse is young, and not yet trained to this perilous kind of service, the rider gallops him up to the verge of the ravine, then covering the animal's head with his bourka, he plunges, almost always with impunity, down precipices that are sometimes from ten or fifteen yards deep ! ' The Circassians are wonderfully expert in the use of fire-arms, and of their double-edged daggers. Armed only with the latter weapon, they have been known to leap their horses over the Russian bayonets, stab the soldiers, and rout their squared battalions. When they are surrounded in their forts or villages, without any chance of escape, they often sacrificed their wives and children, set fire to their dwellings, and perish in the flames rather than surrender. Like all Orientals, they do not abandon their dead and wounded except at the last extremity, and nothing can surpass the obstinacy with which they fight to carry them off from the enemy. The Circassians deal harshly only with those who resist, or who have made several attempts to escape, but in those cases their measures are fully justified by the fear, lest the fugitives should convey important topographical information'to the Russians. ' The Circassians have been accustomed from time immemorial to make prisoners of all foreigners, who land on their shores without any special warrant or recommendation. This custom has been denounced and censured in every possible way, yet it is not so barbarous as has been supposed. En compassed by enemies, exposed to incessant attacks, and relying for their defence chiefly on the nature of their country, the jealous care of their independence has naturally compelled the mountaineers to become suspicious, and not to allow any traveller to penetrate their retreats. But another and still graver charge still hangs over Circassians, namely, their slave dealings, which has so often provoked the generous indignation of122 CIR the philanthrophists of Europe, and for tlie abolition of wliieli Russia has been extolled by all journalists. We are certainly far from approving of that hateful trade in which human beings are bought and sold as merchan dise, but we are bound in justice to the people of Asia to remark that there is a wide difference between Oriental slavery and that which exists in Russia, in the French Colonies, and in America. In the East, slavery becomes in fact a virtual adoption, which has generally a favourable effect both on the moral and the physical weal of the individual. It is a condition by no means implying any sort of degradation, nor has there ever existed between it and the class of freemen that line of demarcation, beset by pride and prejudice, which is found everywhere else. It would be easy to mention the names of many high dignitaries of Turkey who were orginally slaves; indeed, it would be difficult to name one young man of the Caucasus, sold to the Turks, who did not rise to more or less distinction. As for the women, large cargoes of whom still arrive in the Bosphorus in spite of the Russian blockade, they are far from bewailing their lot; on the contrary, they think themselves very fortunate in being able to set out for Constantinople, which offers them a prospect of everything that can fascinate the imagina tion of a girl of the East. All this, of course, pre-supposes the absence of those family affections to which we attach so much value, but it must not be forgotten that the tribes of the Caucasus cannot be fairly or soundly judged by the standard of our European notions, but that we must make due allowance for their social state, their manners and traditions. The sale of women in Circassia is obviously but a substitute and an equivalent for the indispensable preliminaries that elsewhere precede every marriage in the East, with this difference alone, that in the Caucasus, on account of its remoteness, it is an agent who undertakes the pecuniary part of the transaction, and acts as the medium between the girl's relations and him whose lawful wife she is in most cases to become. The parents, it is true, part with their children, and give them up to strangers almost always unknown to them, but they do not abandon them for all that. They keep up a frequent correspondence with them, and the Russians never capture a single Circassian boat in which there are not men and women going to or returning from Constantinople merely to see their children. No one who has been in the Caucasus can be ignorant of the fact that all the families, not excepting even those of high rank, esteem it a great honor to have their children placed out in Turkey. It is to all these relations and alliances, as I may say, between the Circassians and the Turks that the latter owe the great moral influence they still exercise over the tribes of the Caucasus. The name of Turk is-always the best recommendation among the mountaineers, and there is no sort of respectful consideration but is evinced towards those who have returned home after passing some years of servitude in Turkey. After all, the Russians themselves think on this subject precisely as we do, and were it not for potent political considerations, they would not by any means offer impediment to the (Caucasian slave-trade. ' The Circassian women have been celebrated by so many writers, that their beauty has been made the theme of so many charming descrip tions that it may be allowed to say a few words about them. Unfortu nately we are constrained to avow that the reputation of their charms appears greatly exaggerated, and that in person they are much less remarkableUi CIR—DAG than the men.

But as their notions of beauty are quite different from ours, and relate thlftL , plUrnpneSS i a ;i d t] * fW* of the feet, it is not at all surprising that the opinions of the Turks have misled travellers.

The town contains 1,795 well-built houses (containing 8,543 Tartars, 225 Armenians, and 461 Jews) enclosed by a massive crenelated wall, built of large square stones with gates flanked by enormous towers, and it has the additional defence of the citadel of Naraini Kala the supposed work of Alexander, which stands a little higher than the rest of the town with which it is connected by a double rampart. From Darband extended the Caucasian wall, as far as the River Irki Su, according125 to some of Dariel itself. This massive work was 21 feet liif^b, 7 feet wide, the foundation being composed of immense stones, and was intended as a defence against the inroads of the Scythians from the north. Rose-water and opium are prepared by the inhabitants of Darband in addition to copper and iron vessels, and the manufacture of silk and woollen stuffs, but a shallow and defective harbour greatly restrict their commerce. The bazaar is large and well attended, and it has quite an oriental appearance. Darband fell into the hands of the Russians after the war of 1813, though it had formerly been captured in 17'22 by Peter the Great. A hut said to have been inhabited by him is carefully preserved here surrounded both by pillars and chains and defended by a couple of cannon. In the neighbourhood lies the village of Dashkessine at the foot of the precipitous mountain of Kogre Kafe. Here is the remarkable cave of the Dives, traditionally famous as the supposed dwelling-place of the giants of scripture.— {Chesney—Imperial Gazetteer.) DARBAND-I-BASTERA—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Turkish Kurdistan, west of Sulimania, on the road to Altun Kopri. It is over the same hills as the Darband-i-Bazian and a little to the south of it.— (Rich.) DARBAND-I-BAZIAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Turkish Kiirdistan, west of Sulimania, on the road to Altun Kopn. The approach to it is very marshy. The pass is formed by a mere ridge, which advances as it were to close the valley and slopes down very gradually, leaving but a small opening. This is a complete screen facing the two sides of the opening through which the road to Kurdistan leads. In the war between the Province of Baghdad and that of Sulimania the latter fortified this pass and would doubtless have been able to hold it had not a Kurd shewn the former a pass by which it could be turned.— (Rich.) DARDAGH—Lat. Long. Elev. A range of mountains in Russian Armenia, which separates the district of Urdabad from that of Nakhshvan.— (Chesney.) DAREH CHICHEK—Lat. Long. Elev. A valley in Russian Armenia, running into the mountains from the north shore of Lake Gokcha. It is a favourite haunt of the wandering tribes.— (Morier.) DARIEL—Lat. Long. Elev. 4,000. A fortress of Circassia at the entrance of a pass over the Caucasus between Yladi Kavkas and Tiflls, 40 miles south of former, 80 miles north of latter, and on right bank of the Terek. It is built on an isolated and impregnable rock in a most commanding position over the Terek, which here foams through a narrow passage on the mountains. It is now in a very dilapidated state, consisting merely of a strong square tower and a walled space around it capable of sheltering several hundred men. The mountains in the vicinity are scarped and impracticable except by the narrow road leading directly under the walls of the castle. Formerly both sides of the valley were occupied by fortifications so as completely to shut up the entrance to the pass. On the south side this pass may be said to commence at the defile of Annanur, which is not difficult. From this to the Pass of the Cross the road ascends gradually, and a carriage road has been made to the summit of the pass and down to the ravine of the Terek. Thence three miles lie through a narrow ravine bounded by high schist rocks. This126 DAR—DEH pass is dangerous in the spring' from the frequency of avalanches which carry away the road. It has been cut with considerable skill and ex pense. There are, however, two other ravines leading- into Georgia, but they are at present used only by the mountaineers. At the junctions of their ravines is the fortified post of Kodi, and from this the density of the population is quite remarkable for so cold and inhospitable a region ; not a vacant spot is to be seen, and villages are thickly scattered over the mountains all of which was fortified or have a high tower in the middle to reserve as a place of refuge. Thence the route lies for 11 miles on the banks of the Terek, the road generally good and the valley well culti vated to Kasi Bega village. The route now becomes more difficult and rugged and the valley gradually narrows, till it becomes at the eighth mile a mere chasm through which the Terek forces a passage. To the right and left are stupendous rocks of schist, which frequently fall and for a time dam up the course of the river. At this point stands the castle before described. Below this the construction of the military road is a task worthy of a great nation, and the execution of it does credit to the officers by whom it was made. Thence to Vladi-Kav Kas, though there are many strong points very difficult for a traveller, the mountains are accessible to the right and left. The elevation of the summit is only 8,000 feet. It is called ' Sheviskari^ by the Georgians.—( Chesney—Monteith.) DARISHMANA— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Pizdar district of Kurdistan. It is now a miserable village of about 18 houses, but formerly it was the capital of the Bebbeh Kurds, the ancestors of the Pashas of Sulimania.— (Rich.) DARKUSH DAGH—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,490. A pass over the range of mountains which forms the south watershed of the Murad Chai between Mush and Nerjki. From the village of Shin on the east side the road ascends at once to the crest which has an elevation of 6,490 feet. The descent is described as exceedingly dfficult, sometimes lead ing round precipitous hollows in the hills, sometimes coming down in a zigzag the face of a nearly perpendicular rock. The path is uneven and narrow, and the slightest slip would precipitate a traveller a depth of 1,200 feet into the river below. This continues for a distance of about four miles when it becomes more easy, and latterly being ridable the village of Agharun is reached after crossing the Kulb-Su.— (Brant.) DARKUSH DAGH—Lat. Long.

A villag-e in Kflrdistan, Asiatic Turkey, 45 miles from Kerkiik, 25 miles west of S(3limania, near the pass of Darband. It contains 300 houses and produces considerable quantities of cotton, corn, and rice. There are innumer able little rills fresh from the hills near the villag-e which water the valley. It is so called from its having- been originally a settlement of Derg-azinli Turkmans.— (Kinn eir—R ich.) DEVEH BOINA—Lat. Long. Elev.

A tribe of Bedouin Arabs who g-enerally reside in the desert about the Montafik territory, west of the Euphrates. They occasionally make forays in South Mesopotamia. They cross the Tigris at all times and levy con tributions as far as Badrai and Mendali. They give assistance to the Montafik in their wars with one another and with rebellious families subject to that tribe.— [Jones.) DIADIN.—Lat. 39 0 32 , 36 // Long. Elev. A town in Province of Bayazid, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of Murad Chai, close to its source, 24 miles west of Bayazid, 112 miles east of Arzrum. It was a considerable place until the emigration of the Armenians after the Russian war. The Governor lives in a fort of some extent, but in tottering condition and on a perpendicular ravine over the Murad Chai river. In the Russian war it was occupied by the troops of that power under Prince Tchefchewadza.— [Glasscott—Brant—Morier.) DlALA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, formed from the junction of the two rivers, Ab-i-Shirwan and Holwan, which unite seven or eight miles north of Kizl Rabat. The Diala, now become a fine river, still continues its course to the south, and enters the Tigris about five miles above Tak-i- Kaisra, 21 miles below Saklawiya canal. During the summer it is fordableDIA at I3aku1)a, on the road from Bag-hdad to Kirmanshah, and is nearly 150 to 160 yards wide at the place where a bridge of boats has been thrown across it for the convenience of travellers. Just before it approaches the Tigris it forms a considerable defence on the side of Persia for Baghdad, as the right bank is higher than the left by 25 to 30 feet, and is moreover covered with gardens filled with trees. There is a ford at Gondar, and a little to the east of the ford it is navigable for rafts and timber to the Tigris. (Chesney —Kinneir.) DIARBAKR—Lat. 37° 28' to 39° 30' Long. 38° 30' to 42° 10' Elev. A Pashahc of Asiatic Turkey, bounded north by Dujik Dagh, a continuation of the Ararat range; west by the Euphrates; south bv the Pashalics of Orfah, Baghdad, and Musal, and east by Masai, and part of Kurdistan and Mush. Its greatest length from north to south is 150 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west 200 miles, and it has an area of 30,000 square miles. The whole of this Pashalic is exceedingly mountainous and difficult of access; it is inter spersed with narrow and fertile valleys, and full of the most beautiful and romantic scenery. Watered by an infinity of noble streams with a salubrious climate and rich soil, it yields to no other province for the variety and richness of its vegetable and animal produce, while its numerous mountain chains abound in mineral wealth. Among its natural vegetable productions, galls, gum, tragacanth, madder roots, and the pistachio terebin, from' which the native extract a fine oil used in making soap, are the most important, the value of the export of the former alone being upwards of £35,000! Oleaginous seeds and olive oil are produced in large quantities, and the quality of the former is so superior that it finds its way to many of the North Gov ernments. Sheep's wool was exported in 1863 to the value of £ 70,000 ; and mohair, the produce of the Angola goats that thrive so wonderful in the neighbourhood of Jazireh, was eagerly sought after and bought up by the native traders from Kaiserieh and Constantinople, in the same period, to the amount of £20,000. The manufacture of native cotton cloths, shallees made from mohair, and short woollen cloaks is actively pursued, and the shallee for texture and variety of colour and pattern shows the extraordinary natural intelligence of the Kurdish workmen. Diarbakr itself is famous for its silk piece-goods, similar to those of Aleppo and other parts of Syria, but from its great cheapness and durability more in request among the poorer classes of the mountains between Diarbakr and the Black Sea. Sheep are exported in large numbers from the mountains and desert to Aleppo, Damascus, Beyrut, and camels purchased from the Arabs to Kaiserieh and other parts of Asia Minor. The uplands and hills abound in several species of polecat, marten, foxes, and wolves, whose furs add considerablv in value to the sum total of the export list. A beautiful species of spotted lynx (wushek) may be included among the former, although it is far more scarce than those enumerated. A rough estimate of the whole value of the vegetable and animal produce, whether consumed at home or exported, will amount to more than £ 700,000 sterling. The approximate amount of the population living in the 2,702 villages and towns, or in the desert under the Diarbakr Government, is as follows :— Moslem Christian houses. houses. Diarbakr Division ... ... 23,497 8,740 Sort „ ... ... 21,101 6,512 Mardin „ ... ... 21,101 6,413 Yezd houses. 228 917 489 Kizilhdsh houses. 1,516 1,000 Hi I I lilt139 mmmmmrnrn DIA Nomad Kurds tents ... „ Arabs „ Agricultural Arabs Tents Nomad Kiirds with Arab houses and tents Moslem houses, 8£60 13,5(jo 8,000 1,600 Christian houses.

The gross revenue of Government is £179,532 against an expenditure of £43,493, leaving a net revenue of £136,939, yet during the prosperity of the Abasides, deducting revenues of tracts yielded, the same not now included on the Diarbakr Pashalic, a net annual revenue derived chiefly from tithe on produce of 11,750,999 silver dishirns, which at 8^. only would give £449,999, and considerably later in the time of the Zengides, the comparatively small and now worthless district of Sinjar, which however included Nisibin alone, gave a larger income than the present Pashalic. {Kinnelr—Taylor?) DIARBAKR.—Lat. 37° 55' Long. 39° 51' Elev. A city, the capital of the province of the same name, in Asiatic Turkey, situa ted on the right bank of the Tigris, 499 miles south-east of Samsun, 69 miles north-north-west of MardTn, 287 miles north-east of Orfa, and 172 miles south-east of Malatia. The city is situated at a short distance from the right hank of the Tigris, from which it is separated by rich gardens containing white and black mul berries, prunes, apricots, peaches, figs, and gooseberries, together with large forest trees; also ashes, poplars, willows, interspersed with palm, madder, and other plants. It stands on an elevated rocky ridge, stretching from the citadel at its north-western extremity towards the south-west in the shape of a boat, and about 299 yards from the river at its nearest point. It is surrounded by a prodigious wall of black stone, flanked by 72 towers, and enclosing a space of' about five miles in circumference (from which the Turks sometimes call the city by the name of Kara Amid, or the Black Amid) ; this wall was without doubt built by the Romans. It is for height and solidity superior to most things of the kind in either Europe or Asia, though having been much neglected it is now in a ruinous condition. The streets are paved, but are narrow and dirty. The best houses are built of the same material as the walls, which is quarried near the city, sometimes intermingled in building with a white limestone; most of them, however, are of rough stone overlaid with a plaster of mud and straw. The houses are generally flat-roofed, and two stories high, the lower one of stone, and the upper of clay, and the buildings rise in stages like a succession of terraces one above another. Some of the mosques are variegated in their construction, the main body of the edifice being built of the black lava, and the minarets of white limestone, while some of them are covered with lead. A pai't of the bazaars, and several handsome Khans, are also built of black stone. There are 29 mosques, five Christian churches, a synagogue, 20 baths, 15 caravanserais, and a number of bazaars. The principal mosque was formerly a Christian church. It is called the great131 T)TA—DTD mosque, and is the finest remnant of antiquity in the place. Tt has a large square tower now used as a minaret. The Armenian cathedral and Chaldean church lately erected are also handsome structures; the latter is profusely ornamented with foreign paintings. The bazaar is well sup plied with corn and provisions and the adjoining country is fruitful and well cultivated; cotton, silk, copper, and iron are manufactured by the natives and exported to Baghdad and Constantinople. Ice obtained in winter is preserved in the open air by piling it in conical heaps and covering it with straw. In the summer it is sold so cheap that the poorest may cool their drink with it. The gardens in the vicinity furnish the city with a variety of excellent fruit, among which melons are particularly celebrated. W ater is abundant, a fine aqueduct or arches bringing an ample supply, which is afterwards distributed by numerous stone fountains in the streets. The citadel is situated on the north side of the town in a precipitous mass of volcanic rock, and its walls are connected with those of the town, the interior being divided into many courts and handsome buildings, where the Pasha and his ofheers reside. The situation of Diarbakr is admirably calculated for that of a great commercial city, and nothing appears necessary to revive its ancient importance but the removal of the chief cause of decline, namely the insecurity of its commercial communications with Syria, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan, and with the estuary of the Shat-al-Arab. It is said to have contained 38,000 souls in the days of its prosperity, but now it is much reduced : the estimates of its population at present vary from 13,000 to 38,000. Brant states there are 8,000 houses (of which 1,500 are Armenian, 85 Catholics 70 Greek, 50 Jews, and 6,300 Turkish). Southgate states the number of houses to be only 2,700 (of whom 1,500 are Mussulman), while Goldsmid puts it at 20,000 souls (of whom nearly half ai-e Christians). The climate of Diarbakr though excessively hot in summer cannot be considered unhealthy, and in winter the temperature is delightful. {Brant— Kinneir— Ch esney— Go Ids m id.) DIBENEH StJ—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, which rises four miles north-west of Korkar village in the Darkush Dagh, and flowing south joins with the Arganeh Su to form the west or Diarbakr branch of the Tigris. {Taylor). DIDAYENS—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of the Caucasus in the Karkhetia district, who inhabit the mountains to the east of Telav. Their villages are well built and capable of defence. Grain is cultivated, but is often lost on account of the coldness of their country. DIDEWAGHI—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the province of Tarablzfin, Asiatic Turkey, situated directly under the pass of the Kolowah Dagh, which divides it from the Russian district of Guriel. It contains about 18 families. The arable land is of small extent, and in favourable season will not yield the inhabitants above a six months^ supply of grain. They have but few sheep or cattle from the impossibility of procuring winter fodder, which must be given for nearly eight months. The inhabitants are a very fine race of Georgian extraction, and scarcely understand Turkish. The men always go about armed with a rifle and a ' khammah' or large double-edged knife, and they still have suspended from their girdles a knot of cord, which though but ornamental now served formerly to bind any captive Georgian they might meet in their rambles.132 DIG—D1J D1GR0LE—Lat. Long. Elcv. A village in Province of Kars^ Asiatic Turkey, south-west of Kars. DIGWIR—Lat. Long. Elev, A village in the Province of Akalzik, Asiatic Turkey, in the district of Poshkov, of the Chief of which it is the usual residence. DUEL—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of the Province of Baghdad, situated between the Dijel canal and the right bank of the Tigris. Formerly it was one of the most fertile parts of the Pashalic, but now nothing is to be seen but wastes intersected by dried-up canal beds. Jones thinks that if the Pasha would only enter into the scheme earnestly, the whole of this tract might be re-opened to its former extent. The small tribes who now annually exist in a state of semi- starvation around Baghdad would gladly avail themselves of its protection to people the spot; capitalists too would take the idea up, and with the minor irrigants re-opened the tract would soon regain its former fertility, populous- ness, and wealth. The extent of this district is 200 square miles, and though it is some of the finest alluvial land in the world it is all farmed for £877 or £4-10 per square mile. The villages in it are Sumeycheh, Harbah, and Beled. The tribes located on this district are :— A1 Khasirj 130 tents, residing on the Dajeil. A1 Majumoneh 200 „ „ Beled and Kantareh Harba. A1 Makadmeh 150 Beni Jimmin 250 Albu Hyaza 150 Aj Jemeyleh 130 Sumeycha to the Tigris. Khatheyreh. Neighbourhood of Jibareh and Beled. Between Sumeycha and Beled. Total ... 1,010 tents. These are generally cultivators, principally in the employ of the Zabit of the Dijel, who farms the land to them They are rich too in flocks and herds. Portions of them are pastoral and some predatory, for they join the Bedouins at times in their frays. All are petty thieves on every opportunity. They could muster about one gun per tent, and a mounted spearman to every three tents.— [Jones.) DIJEL—Lat. Long. Elev. A canal of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which leaves the Tigris on its right bank just below Samara. Formerly it went thence and watered the land near Baghdad. It was met with in several places by Dr. Ross, but owing to neglect the dyke at the entrance has fallen into a state of decay, and now, instead of constituting an abundant supply, the water carried along this channel occupies only a small part of the ancient bed and this to a moderate depth. It now takes a south-east direction through cultivated lands, where its effect, even in its present diminished state, are most striking in fertilizing the grounds and fruit-gardens surrounding the villages; this is particularly the case near Sameychah which tract, previ-, ously barren, is now remarkable for its fertility. Immediately after—passing this village it is now lost, formerly it went on to Baghdad.— [Chesney— Jones.)133 DIL DIL^M—Lat. Long. Elev. A tribe of Arabs who reside in the Province of Baghdad chiefly on the east bank of the Euphrates from west of Baghdad to the north as far as the town of Hit. Its sections are ;— A1 Mahamdeh 100 tents residing from Sakhawiah to Nemaleh. A1 Duweb 100 99 A1 Ghurbat. A1 Mahamdeh 90 99 99 Sakhawiah to Nemaleh. Abii Shhab 200 99 Nemaleh.

Abu Diyab 200 99 99 Ditto. Abu Assaf 100 99 99 As Sifeyneh. Abu Nimr 300 99 99 Nefateh to Sinadek. Total ... 1,660 tents This tribe is considered powerful. Its families are rich and combine the peaceful character with the warlike one of the B&amp;Mwm; many of its more aristocratic Chiefs and people will not indeed till the soil; they of course fatten upon the spoil obtained from the weak. The territory they inhabit is a rich one, and 840 irrigating wells in the districts are accounted as belonging to them. Each well is supposed to pay to the Zabit of the tribe on account of Government one ton of barley, half a ton of wheat, and the value of about 30 shillings in money at every harvest, but much of this payment is evaded owing to the weakness of the Government. The terri tory of the Dilem on the west of the Euphrates is celebrated for its natural springs of fine water, which in the spring of the year overflow and fall into the Euphrates. In summer the waters recede, but the ground, which they have left moist, is carefully sown with grains, and plentiful crops from this source alone are obtained. These natural fountains called Thannayl and Abulkir are situated about 4^ hours north-west of Kala Rahmati. The latter as their name implies are impregnated with bitumen, but the water otherwise is said to be good and wholesome. The whole district of Dilem from Hit southwards is said to be more or less prolific in sulphur and bitu minous productions, particularly where the springs are thermal and salt as at Hit, having a temperature of about 93°. Much salt is obtained from them by evaporation. Though the occupations of the Dilem are chiefly pastoral, the security of their position, their strength, and character for riches lead them to offer much opposition to the Government, for the Bedouins readily join them when inclined to lawless and refractory designs. The tribe itself indeed usually throws the blame of its actions on these people, who being secure care not to disown the imputation. Their temper is very uncertain, from these causes the roads between Hit, Baghdad and Hilleh are kept in constant alarm from their frays. In the spring they wander as far as the Dijel and Takrit on the Tigris, for the benefit of the richer pastures for their flocks; were they united they might muster 10,000 fighting men, a third having fire-arms. They possess camels, flocks, and herds in abundance and are hospitable. Some of their Chiefs are more intelligent than is usual with Arabs. {Jones.)DTM—DUJ DIMURCHIKAL—Lat. Long. Elev.

It is completely separated from the north ridge, and near its summit, which is tipped with eternal snow and seldom obscured by clouds, is a beautiful valley, perfumed by a thousand sweet-scented flowers. This mountain is famed in the East for its mines, waters, and vegetable productions. The Indians suppose that it contains philosopher's stone and the natives of Ilamadan believe that some of its grasses have the power of transmitting the basest metals into gold as well as of curing any distemper to which the human frame is exposed.— [Kinneir—Chesney.)

A town in Russian Armenia, of which it is the capital, on the left hank of Zengia, a considerable tributary of the Aras, about six miles from the north foot of Ararat. It stands partly on a hill and partly on the maro-in of the stream, which is here crossed by a handsome stone bridge of several arches. It is irregularly built with narrow, dirty, and ill-smelling streets, and is mean in appearance, the houses being built of boulders and mortar made of clay and straw. The north-west side of the town is built on a precipice impending over the river 100 feet, but is commanded by the fort which is surrounded by strong walls flanked with towers. It contains live mosques, five Armenian churches, several caravanserais and 2,750 clay-built houses. It has a considerable circumference, but as a part of the area of the hill is occupied with productive vineyards and fine gardens, the population scarcely exceeds 10,000 persons. The fort of Erivan is of an elliptical form, upwards of 6,000 yards in circumference. One side of it is built on a perpendicular cliff, a steep ravine; here fordable with extreme difficulty from the rocky bed and rapid current of the river. The three remaining sides are defended by double walls, the outer 25, the inner 35 feet high, and these are surrounded by a deep ditch, which on the south side can be flooded. The palace of the Governor is on the summit of the hill enclosed within the fortifications. It is almost in ruins; one wing however, formerly the harem, is used as a hospital: there were also two mosques, one of which has been converted into a church and the other into an arsenal. The remains of the palace are of little architectural interest; the courts, gardens and fountains are trivial, though some of the ornaments, windows, doors and arcades are pretty; the audience chamber alone exhibits traces of an imposing character. This has one end open to a court, being separated from the latter only by some carved lattice work which may be removed at pleasure: the whole then forms a spacious hall. At the opposite end is a large stained window occupying two-thirds of the width of the room and extending from the ceiling to the floor; on each side of this in a projecting recess is a marble basin with a small fountain. The inner court is pretty, containing a basin with three fountains and some trees, and surrounded by the buildings formerly appropriated for the harem. The great mosque of Erivan is the only imposing building on account of its colossal gateway and graceful minaret. Being on the route from Persia to Russia, Erivan has a considerable transit trade. Its manufactures are potteries, tanneries, and some cotton fabrics. The canal system which supplies the city will be found described in the article on the province of Erivan. The taxes raised in the city are as follow r s. Each house pays three roubles, the merchants besides as a body pay 500 roubles, and the artisans a like sum. The city is also called upon to raise large sums for public buildings, bridges and roads, for the Police, the Chief Magistrate and his clerks, public servants, and the town physician. For these purposes a tax is laid on the shops and the gardens, 5 per cent, being levied on the net produce. The inhabitants complain that their condition at present is more oppressesd than it was under the Persians, notwithstanding that the Persian officials exercised an extremely arbitrary and despotic power over them. The imports under their former masters were low, the citizens being only taxed to the amount of 5,000 roubles, including the tribute to the Shah, the salaries of139 Ell I the Sirdar and oilier officials, and the expenses of the city itself. At present the inhabitants are obliged to pay 15,000 roubles, besides being called on to furnish, horses for the post service and to maintain watch and ward, icc. Trade and commerce are heavily burdened; the resident merchant had for merly to pay two abbas for every horse-load of goods on passing from Turkey into Persia, whereas at the present day goods from Persia are charged an export duty of 10 per. cent and an import duty, here of the same amount. The native Persian has only to pay this import duty and is consequently able to sell his goods considerably under those of the ErivSn merchant. Poverty is daily on the increase, and the poor classes, in order to pay their taxes, are often compelled to sell all their furniture and even their very beds, whilst persons in good circumstances, seeing ruin staring them in the face, emigrate for the most part to Persia, where they find every facility for settling. Erivan has stood repeated sieges, and been repeatedly taken both by Turks and Persians, but from the time of Nadir Shah in 171?H it remained in the hands of the Persians. In 1808 it was besieged by the Russians under General Godovitch, who, after blockading it for six months, attempted to carry it by storm, but being repulsed with a loss of 1,500 men killed, was compelled to retire and lost nearly half his army during the retreat to 'lillis. But in 1828 it was besieged by General Paskiwitch, who chose the points of attack well, and opened trenches under cover of a bank formed by a slope on which the fortress was built. The trenches advanced almost under cover to the south-west angle and the principal breaching battery was established in the low swampy ground against this face. The batteries entirely destroyed the parapets and made a breach on the south-west angle, and an assault was then delivered, and was scarcely resisted. Since then Erivan has remained in the hands of the Russians, who have now added to its fortifi cations to such an extent that its capture would be exceedingly difficult, or perhaps impracticable to a Turkish or Persian army. Abich gives the following table of the average temperature of the air at Erivan at the various seasons, winter 19'8, spring 53*4, summer 70'3, autumn 57'2 Fahrenheit.— [Kinneir—Monteith—Chesney—I un llaxthausen —Shiel—A b ick.) ERlVAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A province of the Government of Georgia, Russia, bounded, north by Elizabethpol, Shamsadil, Kazakh and Bambak Shuragel; east by Karabagh and Nakhshvan ; west by the Turkish territories of Kazikhman and Kars; and south by the Aras. The south part of this province is intersected by branches from Mount Ararat, and in the north part are the peaks of Alagaz, Barate, Maraldegi, Jagh Natchakh, Sukbolak, &amp;c., but near the Aras there is an extensive plain. Between the Aras and Ararat the country is marshy and again in other places clayey, but the greatest part of it consists of a rich black earth. There is one lake, that of Gokcha or Sevangha, which is 30 miles long, 12^ miles broad, and 1,000 feet above the bar. Besides the border River Aras the province is watered by the Karasu, the Zangi, the Northern Karasu, the Abaran, and the great Arpa Chai. In the elevated divisions the cold is severe during winter, and in summer the heat of the plains is almost insupportable. The ordinary animal and vegetable productions abound in this province, and it contains 508 flourishing villages. Van Haxthausen says the plain of Erivan exhibits everywhere traces of volcanic origin in its lava and basaltic rocks, with fragments of which.140 ERI—ERZ the ground is covered ; this has great influence on the formation and nature of the stratum of humus, which is hot and dry, but extremely fertile, when sufficiently watered, without which not a blade of grass would grow. It would in fact be an uninhabitable steppe but for the net-work of canals which extends over eveiy part, irrigating the cornfields, gardens, as well as meadows. This canal system, which irrigates the whole of the district including the city of.Erivan with its gardens, meadows, and cornfields, derives its supplies from Lake Gokcha, 30 miles distant. At that place the Zangi River issues from the lake, and canals are branched off in all direc tions from the lake and river conveying water to the surrounding villages. At Kanakir these branches all unite and here commence the waterworks of Erivan which comprise four principal canals, the first supplies the houses and land to the left and is nearly consumed by the time it reaches the citv. Abahajath, tlie second canal, runs a distance of six miles, Mamuri, the third canal, branches off to the right and runs about five miles; from the city ; it is carried for a length of 1,200 yards through a cutting on the rock, and affords the chief supply of water to the gardens of the city; it is called the subterranean canal. Dalmi, the fourth canal, turns to the right at a distance of three miles. Two other canals branch off in the vicinity of the city; those are not used for irrigation but for driving mills, nineteen of which are worked by each canal. The canal system thus admirably laid out is easily kept in order, all who use the water being called on to contribute money and labour for its repair in proportion to the amount they consume. The distribution of the water too is very carefully regulated by officers appointed for the purpose, each garden or field being supplied for a given time under their direction. The province of Erivsn suffered very much from the war of 1828 with Russia. In 1826 it yielded, says Monteith, a revenue of 20,000 tomans and had a population of 25,000 families. Of these 5,000 Kurdish families retired to Turkey and about 3,000 other Mahamadan families to Persia; in fact, if left free, few of the latter would remain. On the other hand, nearly 4,000 Armenian families emigrated from various districts of Azarbijan for the protection of the Russian Government. Morier says that under the Persians the province was 140 miles long bv 80 miles broad, and had a population of adult males, of ages from 15 to 50, of 18,700. This multiplied by four for women, children, and old men, gives a total of 74,800 souls. This includes all the nomad tribes except Kurds, of whom there were 5,000 families, thus making the total up to 100,000 souls. The revenues of the province were reckoned at 180,000 tomans. {Chesney—Van Haxthausen—Morier—Monteith) ERZINJAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Euphrates, 85 miles south-west from Arzrum. It is a town containing about 3,000 houses, of w r hieh 800 are Armenian and the rest Turkish; it is governed by a Bey who is dependent on Arzrum. The houses here, and in all the villages of the plain, are built above grounds which gives them a more agreeable and cheerful appearance than in other parts of Armenia. 1 he town is situated at the west end of a beautiful and rich plain, which is about 20 miles long by seven or eight broad. The Gujik mountains form its boundary, and at their fort runs the Kara Su. The climate here is never severe in winter, and it is warm in summer.ERZ—ETC There are said to be 100 villages in the plain of Erzinjan, which arc surrounded by very extensive gardens, which furnish great abundance excel lent fruit to the circumjacent districts as far as Arzium, Baibut, and Gumish Khana; grapes and melons are among the fruits produced. 1 he plain also bears quantities of wheat of a very fine description. The centre of the plain is rather swampy and shows indication of salt. It affords pasture to a great number of mares, cows, and sheep. Nowhere probably in Asia Minor is a plain to be met with a more luxuriant vegetation, nor with the appearance of more careful cultivation.— [Brant.) ESLAYA.—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,258.

They number about 2,500 tents, viz., Saieh 500; El Lslem l,o00; Es Sedeyd 500 ; and are subject to the Shamr Arabs.— {Taylor) ETCHMIADZIN—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Russian, Armenia, Government of Georgia, 12 miles west of Erivan, situated in a broad plain between Mount Ararat and the range of Alagez. It consists of 360 farms, which with the gardens attached to them are the property of the inhabitants who pay a fixed tax to the convent. r i his village was founded in 524 A.D. It is surrounded by high walls, 30 feet high, with eight towers and four gates, and was formerly regarded as a strongly forti fied place. A deep arched gateway leads into the outer court, in which are a great number of booths, kept by shopkeepers and mechanics of every description; there is also a wax manufactory. A second gateway leads into the inner court, in the centre of which stands the celebrated Cathedral. Por tions of this structure have evidently been erected at very different periods, and there are contributions from various schools of architecture, Byzantine, Gothic, Moorish, and modern Italian; one part is of quite modern origin. A mysterious twilight pervades the interior of the church, even on the brightest days, enhancing the solemn effect of the building, which is by no means of colossal dimensions; its length is about fifty yards, its breadth forty-eight, and its height thirty-five. The Byzantine style and its sym bolic forms predominate in the interior, and inscriptions abound on all parts of the edifice; there is also a Tibetan bell, with the mystical invocation, ' Om mani padmi om' inscribed upon it. The position and style of the altar, and the general arrangements of the interior, are not Greek, but bear a greater resemblance to those of the Latin Church. The Cathedral is splendidly adorned with gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, and still greater wealth is said to be kept under lock and key. Near the high altar is a beautiful chair, carved with great skill, evidently of European workmanship, in the rococo, or rather renaissance style; it was said to be a present from a former Pope to the Patriarch of that dav. There are no pictures of value; the walls are painted in the variegated flower style of the Persians, executed by an Armenian artist in 1736. Among the relics at Etchmiadzin are shewn, the head of the spear with which the Roman soldier pierced the side of Jesus, the arm of St. Gregory, the scalp of St. Kepsime, &amp;c. The library according to \ un llaxthausen 14.1142 etc—eup consists of 500 Armenian works, of which 91 are on historical subjects and the rest are treatises on religion, lives of Saints, and copies of the Evan- ovlists. A catalogue was made of it in 1836 by the learned Frenchman, Brosset. .... . , - The Patriarchate at Etchmiadzin is of incalculable importance to the unity and nationality of the Armenian people. It is the central point where pilgrims from the Ganges and the Indus, the Euphrates and Nile, the V'ol- ga^the Neva and the Bosphorus first meet and become acquainted and form ties of fraternal union. From all these countries the priests come to fetch the holy oil which the Patriarch alone can consecrate : thus the unity of the national church is constantly recognised and cemented afresh.— [Chemey— Van Haxthausen—Morier.) EUPHRATES—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Asiatic Turkey, which rises from two great sources in the Armenian mountains. It bears the name of Frat in its whole course from the most northern of these sources, which is situated in the Anti-Taurus, 25 miles north-east of Arzrnm. The branch from thence takes a westerly- direction at first, and, after passing within seven or eight miles of the capi tal of Armenia, it is joined, a few miles further west, by two small feeders coming also from the north; then after a course of about 40 miles further to the west-south-west, it receives a third coming from the west near Kather-kopri; and again, a little lower, but on the opposite side, and coming from the Judi Tagh range, the Mahmah Khatum, which is its first large tributary, and runs into it through the plains of Terjan. From the river, which is now a considerable stream known by the name of the Karasu, makes a circuit, winding through the mountains and over rapids, into the plain of Erzinjan. Here the KarSsn enters a narrow, difficult defile, which continues as far as Kemakh, a mountain town. At the eastern side of Kemakh, a large tributary, called the Komer Su, enters from the westward, beyond the town of Devrek, after a course of 70 or 80 miles, with a sufficient body of water to carry timber, which is after wards floated along the Karasu for the use of Keban Maden. Immediately after the junction of this branch, the main trunk passes under a wooden bridge, and enters a deep chasm in the mountains, through which its united waters have forced their way. The stream continues nearly south-west after passing the defile, as far as the ferry of Khostu, three miles below; and, near the village of Pash-tash, it enters a vast rent in the mountains, with precipices on both sides, rising to the height of 1,000 or 1,500 feet. After passing this chasm, the river makes a short bend to the south-east, but soon resumes the general direction of south-west, and flows the deep valley of Egm. The mountains rise to about 4,000 feet on each side of this singular fissure, which is so narrow that it is crossed by a bridge between lofty limestone precipices, seeming to overhang the town, and as it were to threaten its destruction. Below Egm, on the right bank, the river maintains the general direction south-west through mountain valleys, till it arrives at about five miles short of the Keban Maden ferry and the lead-mines, where it is joined by the Murad Chai or Su, being, at this point, about 270 miles from its course. The latter is the great eastern branch of the Euphrates, and, from its size, it ought perhaps to be considered the principal stream. It rises on the southern slope of Ala Tagh, a mountain about 9,000 feet high, and takes a143 EUP general north-east course for about 24 miles, to Diyadin, a small town west of Bayazid, and situated on one of the more elevated branches of the Taurus, not very distant from the highest point at Ararat. After passing Diyadin, this great branch of the Euphrates takes a west-north-west direction nearly so far as Mula Usman, where it receives a feeder coming from the west. Here the main stream pursues a south-west course along the great valley formed by the Dujik range on the north, and the Supin and Nimrud Taghs on the south, receiving several streams coming from the high grounds on each side. After a course of nearly 120 miles, in the direction above mentioned, and when at a point about 60 miles south by east of Arzrum, and 20 north of Mush, it receives a small tributary, called the Char Bahar Su, coming by a south-east course from the slopes of the Bingol Tagh range, which attains, at its culminating point, an elevation of about 9,000 feet. This accession of water gives a new direction to the main stream, which now winds towards the south for about 20 miles (or in the direction of Mush), until it is turned by the offsets of the Nimrud Tagh at 10 or 12 miles short of that place; and, after running a few miles nearly in a westerly direction, it re ceives from the Nimrud Tagh and plain of Mush, a little way west of Lake Van, another river, bearing the often repeated Turkish name of Kara Su. Its sources are in the crater of a volcano, over the lips of which it bursts in two streams. These immediately unite and form a considerable river, which, after a west-north-west course of about 30 miles, passes within three miles of the northern side of Mush, a town which contains 1,200 houses, at an elevation of 4,692 feet above the level of the Black Sea. The Murad Su now pursues a new direction, west by south, after the junction of the Kara Su, and continues to wind along the valleys nearly parallel to the Dujik Tagh, from the slopes of which range it receives several considerable streams. Amongst these may be particularly noticed the Gunbrik Su, coming into the main trunk from the north, about midway between Mush and Paid and likewise the Pereh Su, which enters below the latter place, after a south-west course of considerable length. Near Palu the Murad sweeps round, and takes a west-north-west direction, until it joins the western branch, two hours above Kebban Ma den, having pre viously made a tortuous course of a little more than 400 miles through a mountainous country, over an irregular, and, generally speaking, a rocky bed. As far as their junction the branches are partially navigable; since, as we are informed by Mr. Brant and others, timber is floated down them for the working of the mines. Here the Euphrates assumes an imposing character, as it runs south-westward, struggling as before, to make good its original course towards the Mediterranean, it bears indifferently among the natives the names of Frat or Murad. The western branch, as will have been perceived, has already forced its way through that portion of the Anti Taurus which appeared at one time to offer an insuperable barrier to its onward progress, especially in the direction of the Mediterranean. Below the ferry of Maden, where it is 120 yards wide and very deep, the Tauric chain, against which it still presses, forces the river to incline rather more southward ; and at about 15 miles in this direction from the ferry it receives a tributary, called the Chamurli Sfi (mnd water), coming from the west, through a narrow and well-cultivated valley; and again, seven144 EUP miles farther on another and still larg-er, called the Tokhma Su (boundary water), which latter has been supposed to be the Kuramas, or Melas of the ancients, and to have g'iveu its name to the district and town of Malatiah. This stream comes from the Gok Dille mountains on the slopes of the Anti Taurus; it flows past the town of Gurur, and is, on approaching the populous and interesting- town of Derendah, a consi derable stream, from the latter place its course is nearly eastward to the Euphrates, into which it enters below the towns of Aspuzi and Malatiyah, near which it is suited for boats of light draught. After receiving the Tokhmah St3 at half a mile beyond the Eis Oghlu ferry, the Murad enters the main chain of the Taurus, and, after strggling onwards in various directions for about 45 miles, among the recesses of their mountains, bounded by lofty precipices, and constantly interrupted by rocks, as well as small rapids, .it finally forces a passage through the Taurus, leaving to the right, or north, the higher part of this chain. Until lately it had been supposed that this portion of the river was not in any way navigable, but, during the campaign of 1839, it was the uniform practice of Hafiz Pasha to embark his stores on rafts, and float them down at least to Sumeisat, from whence the stream continues navigable, without any serious interruption, for a distance of 1,195^ miles to the Sea. After clearing the difficulties just alluded to, the windings continue to be short and abrupt, between low, steep hills; and the river takes the general direction of west-south-west as it passes near the eastern side of the ruined walls of Sumeisat, having received on each side, in the previous part of its course, several inferior tributai'ies. The distance thus far, by the windings along the western branch, is about 450 miles, whilst that by the larger branch, or Murad, is about 586 miles. After passing the Zeugma of Sumeisat, the river winds through a succes sion of swelling hills, having a pasture country on each side, with partial cultivation around the villages, which are scattered here and there along the banks, within an extent of 51 miles, by the stream ; and 40 miles in a direct line, south 69° west, to Rnm Kala. Immediately below this town the river changes its direction, and inclines rather eastward of south for a distance of 15 miles, through a more cultivated country, when it approaches the ruined castle of Graum, which is but 80i miles from the sea at Bayas. The distance from Graum is 10 miles east-south-east to Bireh-jik, which place is 26^ miles by the river, and 16 miles directly south 2b 0 east from Jtium Kala. Bir is one of the most frequented of all the passages into Mesopotamia, and about 16 large passage boats are kept at this place, in a state of repair, for the use of the caravan, which occasionally number 5,000 camels. The bed of the river at this place has been ascertained to be 628^ feet above the level of the Mediterranean sea, from which it is distant 140 miles and 26 chains by the road, or 133 miles iti a direct line, to the mouth of the Orontes, whilst the Persian Gulf, towards which it now begins to incline a little, is distant 1,117 miles, thus giving the trifling fall of rather more, on an average, than six inches per mile, from Bir to the Persian Gulf, supposing the latter to be on the same level as the Mediterranean. The general direction below Bir is a little east of south, and it winds between chalk hills of moderate elevation for 35 miles, or 312 south 27i east direct distance, to Kalat En-Nejm.145 t EUP At 14 miles, and again at nine miles, above this celebrated Arabian observatory, erected by Almamum, the Euphrates receives on its right bank the Sajur, a considerable tributary, which comes from the Taurus, and after passing at no great distance from the northern side of the ruins of Membij, separates into five short branches, thus forming four islands as it enters the principal stream. At 48^ miles below Kalat en Nejm, or 34 miles in a direct line south 8° west, is the castle, and near it the ruins of li'alis, the Barbalissus of the Romans, once the port of the ancient Beroe, and the P'thara of Balaam. Here the river seems finally to abandon the struggle it had hitherto maintained to reach the shores of the Mediterra nean, from whence it is distant 123 miles, and in the direction through Aleppo to Suwei'diyeh, and 118 miles through the same city to Iskandarun, the distance in a direct line south 70° west, being 101^ miles. The course of the stream from Balis to the striking ruins of Jaber castle, the Sela Midbarah of Benjamin of Tudela, is 29 miles, or 22^ miles direct distance south 68° east. From hence, passing the ferry of Hammam, the windings give 42 miles, or 26 miles direct distance, north 82° east, to Rakkah, the river flowing through a fine pasture country, having extensive Bedouin flocks feeding on its prairies, but no per manent villages. A few miles below the deserted ruins of the city and palace of the Kaliph A1 Mansur, the Belik, or Belity, pursuing a southerly course, enters the Euphrates. This stream rises near Harran, at a spring called A1 Dhahabiyab, or Dabencea. Below Rakkah the hills are at a greater distance than before from the river, which winds through the dense forest of Amran, and through a flat country, which is generally well-wooded. After a tortuous course of 80 miles, or south 09° east, 44^ miles direct from Rakkah, the great stream lorces its way in a most remarkable manner through the chain of hills running along the western side of Palmyra, and from thence towards Sinjar. At this spot, after flowing round a large wooded island, the river makes an abrupt bend, nearly at a right angle pursuing its course in a smooth channel, 250 yards wide, and seven fathoms deep, ' between the beetle-browed rocky precipices of Balbi.' These rise abruptly to a height of from 300 to 500 feet above the water's edge, and thus present for a moment, but in appearance only, an insuperable barrier to navigation. At two and a half miles below this range, the river passes between the two ancient and deserted marble-built towns of Zelebi, or Chelebi, which indicate one of the great commercial passages to Palmyra, at the period of the prosperity of the latter city. From Zellebi to Deer, the distance by the stream is 57^ miles, or 26 miles south 38° east direct. At 27^ miles by water, and 18 south, 42° east direct distance below Deir, the Khabur enters the Euphrates after a lengthened course. Below the tributary just followed, the course of the Euphrates is south ea«t, along the southern side of some ancient ruins, presumed to be those of Dakia; it proceeds next to the little town of Maden, lower down oil the opposite side, and near the ancient castle of Rahabah, or Rehoboth, which is about three and a half miles to the south-west of the latter place. 1' rom hence the river passes onwards through a fine country, generally well an( ? ra ^ ler hilly, but very thinly peopled, as far as Is-Geria and &gt; erdi, which latter is 75^ miles from the Khabur by the windings, and 45^ south 33° east in direct distance. Throughout this extent the river146 EUP may be said to have an average width of nearly 400 yards, with an ordinary depth of 18 feet, and a current of four miles per hour, during the season of floods, at which period of the year it forms, in this part of its course, at intervals, 17 islands of various sizes, some of the largest being well wooded. Below Werdi the river sweeps round the western side of the ruins of Erzi, where it takes a new direction, and proceeds, by a much more winding course than before, to the towns of Ravva and Anah: this last is 92 miles from Werdi by the river, though the direct distance is but 50if miles (east). The average width from Werdi may be considered as 350 yards, with an ordinary depth of 18 feet, and it has a current of four miles per hour during the flood season, when it forms at intervals 2.6 islands of vari ous sizes, some wooded and some bare. At the last of these, viz., Karabla, the river is obstructed by a ledge of rocks, which constitutes what may be considered as the greatest difficulty experienced by boats throughout the navi gation from Bir to Basrah. Opposite this place the walled town of Rawa crowns the summit of the hills rising from the left bank, whilst a little lower, the houses of Anab along the right bank open to the view amidst thick date groves. A string of islands lie nearly in mid-streams, opposite the town, and still lower, but on the left bank, are the ruins of the ancient Anaths. Below this picturesque spot the windings are less frequent than m the portion just described; and the course of the river is through a a succession of partially wooded hills, chiefly of chalk formation, affording good pasture. Villages occasionally appear, with cultivated grounds about them, and the numerous remains of ancient aqueducts, covering both banks, sufficiently show, what we learn from history, namely, that this portion of the country was at one time thickly inhabited by a civilised and flourishing people. The distance from Anah to the island of Iladisah is 49^ miles by the stream, and 28^ miles south 48° east in a direct line. The river at this place has an average width of 300 yards, with a depth of 18 feet, and a current of four knots per hour in the season of floods, when it forms -50 islands, some of which are wooded, and a few, such as Tilbus, have on them the remains of ancient buildings. Above Hadissah, and at about two-thirds of the distance from Anah, the river, being turned by high hills, makes a very remarkable sweep in the opposite direction, or north-east, not unlike the Thames at the Isle of Dogs, though on a larger scale; for the Euphrates, at the spot called Hawaji el Khawvvaslik, has gained only 2^ miles to the south-east, although its course along the bend is 16| miles. The distance from Hadisah to the well-known town and bituminous fountains of the ancient Hit, still famous for boats coated with bitumen, is 55 miles by water, and scarcely 36 miles south 36° east in a direct line. The scenery is like that of the preceding portion of the river in every respect; and about midway there is a similar great sweep, by which, during a course of 14i miles, it only gains 5^ miles south-eastward. The stream, throughout this part of its course, has an average width of 350 yards, with a depth of 16 feet, and a current of three knots per hour in the season of floods; when there are 14 islands, some of which contain small towns, built on ancient sites. Five miles above Hit two walls have been built under water, out from both banks, with the view of raising the water at low seasons sufficiently for irrigational purposes, but the effect of them in the river is to increase the force of the current and thus in a measure impede the navigation.147 EUP Three miles below Hit the remains of acjueduets disappear, and the wind ings become shorter and more frequent, as the river flows through a tract of country almost level. At a distance of 77 miles along the stream, or 4S miles direct south, 70° east, is the modern castle of Felujah, situated 29| miles west 2° north of Baghdad. The average width in this part of the river decreases a little, being only about 250 yards, with an ordinary depth of 20 feet; and there is a current of less than two and a half miles per hour in the Hood season, when the river forms 13 islands without wood. Above Felujah, at 5| miles north 60° west from it, the derivation called the Saklawiyah takes place : this stream crosses Mesopotamia by tortuous eastern course on the north side of Akar Kuf, and now enters the '1 igris at a point five miles below Baghdad. Below the mounds of Mahamad, the great river takes a straighter course, in a more southerly direction, as far as the floating bridge on the western side of the town of Musseyib, and proceeds through the date groves surrounding this place, across a bare country, onwards to Hillah, which is 91 miles by water, or 61 ^ miles direct south 33° east from Felujah. The stream in this part of the course has an average breadth of 200 yards, with an ordinary depth of 15 feet, and a current of barely two and a half knots per hour in the season of floods; when there are 15 low islands, some of them covered with jungle. From Felujah to llillah the banks are Hat and alluvial with considerable cultivation and numerous herds of goats, sheep, and bullocks. Soon after passing the ruins of Babel the river begins to assume that appearance which may have caused Herodotus to say, that it differs from all other great streams, by becoming smaller towards the lower than in the higher part of its course. The numerous canals drawn from each side, at short intervals from each other, in order to irrigate the fields, as well as the date groves and pome granate gardens, near the villages here covering both banks, produce a change in the appearance of the country, which, although very gradual, becomes sufficiently evident, especially after passing the derivation called Ynsafiyah, which takes place at one mile and a half above Diwaniyah. About 18^ miles below, another derivation, forming the canal of old Lamlum, takes place, and the river rather decreases from hence to the entrance of the canal, which is 75^ miles by water, and 55^ miles south 31° east direct, from the floating bridge at Hillah. The river is reduced to 1G0 yards in width opposite Diwaniyah, and is again diminished to 120 yards towards Lamlum ; having an ordinary depth of about 12 feet, with a current of two miles and three quarters per hour in the season of floods; and it forms but one island in all the distance from Babel to the commencement of what was at one time the commencement of the Chaldean lake. At the north-western extremity of the plain, the Euphrates forms two branches, - from which smaller ones and numerous irrigating cuts subsequently diverge. These reunite at some rising ground near El Rarayem, which presents itself on both sides of the main trunk, and there is thus produced what may truly be called a delta, although distant from the sea; since the obstruction thus offered during the season of floods causes the waters to spread for about 30 miles, that is, from the north-western to the south eastern extremity of the basin ; the latter extends in width from 10 to 11' miles westward of the main channel, and to a much greater distance on the opposite or eastern side.EUP Nearly a mile below the separation of the Lamlum branch, another, called the canal of Sasend, takes place on the opposite side, in the direction of Samawah. The main channel now pursues, with a diminished volume, the general direction of south-east, by a number of veiy deep, short bends in the marshes, near the extremity of which it is rejoined by the Serayeh, or Semawah branch, on the western side. At seven miles lower, near Karayem, which is 42 miles by water and 331 miles south 48° east from the bifurcation, it again receives the eastern branch coming from Lamlum, having previously received on both sides the remains of what had been by different channels conveyed from it to the villages and rice-grounds. Being thus reunited to its former waters, and at the same time free from those marshes in which it had been supposed to be lost, the Euphrates suddenly re-appears on its former large scale, inclosed between high banks covered with jungle. Soon after this change, when passing the western side of the mat village of A1 Khudhr, which is 49^ miles by water, and 36^ miles, south 43° east direct from Lamlum, it averages 200 yards in breadth, and contains nine small islands. The greater branch has, in the marshes and during the season of floods, a large average breadth of about 60 yards, with an ordinary depth of eight feet: a portion of the right bank is, however, still visible, and is used by trackers. Like the country inwards on each side of the river, the left bank is covered with a shallow inundation, amidst which numerous villages, consisting of houses formed of reeds, covered with mats of the same material, appear here and there on the more elevated spots of ground, which are all but hidden by the water. The Lamlum marshes form the greatest difficulty to the navigation of the Euphrates up to this point, and this is owing to the extreme narrowness of the river, the sharpness of its bends, and to the current. But a steamer of considerable power and small length would have no difficulty of passing through them at any time of the year. Below A1 Khudhr the course of the river is tolerably straight, and it flows through a fertile country, abounding with villages, either of mats or tents, surrounded by rich date-groves. The largest of the former class is A1 Kut, the residence of the Shekh of Montefik. From this place to Shekh el Shuyukh the average width of the river is about 250 yards, and its ordinary depth is 20 feet, with a current of two miles and a half per hour in the season of floods. There is but one island in this part of its course. Near Suk-es-Shioukh the right bank of the river is swampy, covered with reeds and during the rise of the river inundated, the left is studded very generally with date trees, among which a village now and then appears. Below Sheikh el Shuyukh, the river turns nearly eastward, and the banks being very low, it again forms a kind of delta, extending to Kurnah, which is 62J miles by water, or 491 miles nearly due east, direct from Sheikh el Shuyukh. Within that distance the river preserves the same breadth as before; its depth is 18 feet, and it has a current in the season of floods of two miles per hour, independently of the tide, which is slightly felt all the way. The Euphrates and Tigris joining from the west and north-west respect ively now form a tidal channel, almost half a mile wide, take nearly a straight course, south 37° eastward under the well known appellation of Shat al Arab, and when five miles below Kurnah their united waters receive those of the Kerah, or Kerkhah, which coming from the mountains ol' Ardelfln,EUP through an extensive tract of country, passes a short distance westward of the ruins of Susa, and likewise of the town of llawizah. After receiving this accession, the Shat al Arab flows through date-groves and near several villages, chiefly on the left bank and at length arrives opposite Basrah, which is 39^ miles by the nver, and 36 miles south 34- east direct from Kurnah. In the whole of this distance there are but two islands, both of them large, and the river has an average width of 600 yard;, with a depth of 21 feet; it has a current of two knots per hour during the flowing, and three knots per hour during the ebb tide. Below the city this majestic river sweeps a little more to the eastward; its width is about 700 yards; its ordinary depth 30 feet; and it forms three large islands between this place and the small town of Mahamarah; that is within a distance of 22* miles by water, or 20* miles direct, south 70 east. Here the Karun enters it, after a long course from the Koh-i-Zard, through Shustar, Ahwaz, and other places. , • v v*+i After this great accession to its waters, the Shat al Arab inclines a little more towards the south; during the remainder of its course it passes many laro-e villages, and almost continues belts of date-groves; and at length it reaches the sea, which at the bar is 40 miles from Mahamarah Between this last place and the sea its average width is 1,200 yards, and its ordinary The permanent flooding of the Euphrates is caused by the melting of the snow in the mountains along the upper part of its course, ilns takes place about the beginning of March, and it increases gradually up to the time ot barley harvest, or about the last days in May, when it is usually at its greatest height. At Port William the depth was found to be increased by 13* feet but, lower down, this varied, as may be supposed, in difterent places, according to the width of the stream. The river continues high and its course very rapid for 30 or 40 days, but afterwards there is a daily decrease, which becomes very small and regular towards autumn, rrom the middle of September to the middle of October the river is at the lowest; and it even seems to be perfectly stationary, until the rains commence, towards the end of October, when there is a perceptible but variable increase which continues till the frost checks it in December, and causes it again to fall. From this time until the beginning of March it is subject to slight alterations of decrease and increase. „ T . i ^ ™ i j i From the measurements and calculations of Lieutenants Cleveland and Murphy, it is found that at Hit the mean of the velocities of the current at high and low water in the Euphrates is 4-46 feet per second; and that, r at Baghdad, the mean velocity of the Tigns is 7*33 feet per second. Ihe mean velocity of the Danube at Pesth has, by Mr George Renme, been ascertained to be 2 33 feet per second; and Mr. Girard determined the mean velocity of the Nile at Cairo to be only one foot 11 inches per It mav not be uninteresting to mention here that, from the observations of the two officers above mentioned, Mr. Renme found the quantity ot water discharged by the Euphrates at Hit ^ 72,804 cubic feet per second; and the quantity discharged by the Tigris, at Baghdad, to be 1,64,103 cubic feet. The sum of these quantities ( _ x,36,.)07 cubic teet) mav, perhaps, be taken as a near approximation to the whole quantity dis charged in a second by the Shat al Arab, which is formed by the united 149 *150 EUP—FEL waters of those rivers. Mr. Rennie estimates the quantity discharged by the Danube in an equal time at 3,38,100 cubic feet. [Chesney.) EYRUH—Lat. Long-. Elev.

It is situated at the foot of a high chain of mountains, six miles from the Kur, to which the ground descends with a very gradual slope here and there intersected by insignificant ravines. As a fortress it is of no great strength, and its position on the great route of the plain of the Kur appears to greater advantage as a defence to Georgia on the map than it is in reality. Notwithstanding that it is situated on a high plain with a gravelly soil and good water, and is open all round securing a free circulation of air, yet during the months of July, August, and September it is constantly visited with a most malignant fever so that all the inhabitants who have the means of leaving it remove to the mountains at that season and encamp there at a distance of about six miles from the town where the evil influence seem to disappear. It was taken by a night escalade in 1803 by a Russian force under Prince Sesianof from the Persian Commander and has since been incorporated with the Russian territories. It consists of three parts, one of which is fortified by a bastion wall which was constructed by the Turks.

It is bounded on the north generally by the crest of the Caucasus, except Daghistan, which is bounded on the north by the Terek, on the east by the Caspian, on154 GEO the south by the Persian province of Azarbijan and the Turkish provinces of Arzrum and Kars, and on the west by the Black Sea. Its divisions are Daghistan, Lesgistan, Baku, Kuba, ShirvSn, Karabagh, Erivan, Kakhetia, Kartelinia, Immeretia, and Mingrelia, Guria, and Abasia. The g-eneral aspect of Georgia is for the most part mountainous, though it contains many extensive and well cultivated plains, and is watered by innumerable rivers. The mountains of Georgia consist of the spurs of the Caucasus which run at right angles to the main range, viz., from north-east to south-west. In its extreme west is the connecting link between the Caucasus and the westerly stem of Mount Ararat. This crosses the road between Kutais and Gori, and running through the district of Akhltskhai to-that of Guriel enters the Pashalic of Kars, whence it runs south-west towards Arzrum. In about latitude 40° 40' this range throws a spur to the north-east which going through the Turkish district of Childir and round the sources of the Arpahchai enters Russian territory north of Gumri, and takes the name of the Abotz Mountains. In about longitude 44° the range splits one spur going north and then east under the name of Didgori runs down to Tiflis, the other taking a southerly course passes to the east of Gumri, shortly after which it also divides, one branch containing the former direction is ended by the Aras between the Arpa Chai and the KSrasu Rivers. The other trends away to the east till it reaches the northernmost point of Lake Gokcha, when it runs south-east following the contour of the lake draining north to the Kiir, south to the lake, till it comes to the Sarial peak, which is the final point of disseverance, as from here the spurs of this range star out on all directions, one going west and north round the lake, another runs south to the east of Tvakhshvan,while others run south-east,east, and north-east through Karabagh to the junction of the Kur and the Aras. The principal plains lie in the east towards the Caspian, between the Km* and the Aras, and on the north bank of the former river. The two principal rivers in the Province are the Kur and the Aras, with the Aragua, Yora, Alazan, tributaries of the former, and the Arpa Chai, Zengui, affluents of the latter. Besides these few named these rivers receive innumerable torrents from the mountains above them, and there are many minor streams on its west, which like the Phasis carry the water of Abasia, Mingrelia, and Immeretia to the Black Sea, while the drainage of Daghistan all goes towards the Caspian. The principal lake in Georgia is that of Gokcha, but there are some smaller ones, as Khano Ghell, Tchopno Ghell and Kara Ghell in Karabagh. The climate of Georgia is extremely varied, and embraces an extraordinary difference of temperature. Some parts in the higher mountains being covered with snow at the same time as tropical vegetation may be flourishing 50 miles off. The mountains must have a magnificent climate, but all accounts agree m stating the coasts of both the Caspian and the Black Sea as well as all the low valleys to be extremely unhealthy at certain seasons. The following tables are taken from Abich's note on the climatology of this countrv. It shows observations taken at five different places, but as all are low, it gives no idea of the temperature of the higher portions of the country:— r156 GEO Difference between Winter and Summer, 1848.

The animal productions are horses, bullocks, bufPaloes, sheep, swine, camels. And of wild animals tigers, panthers, bears, wolves, boars, and jackals are abundant. Besides all the rivers swarm with fish, and nearly every description of game may be found in the woods, hills, or plains. It is difficult to arrive at any estimate of the population of Georgia, but the following particulars are gleaned from various sources :— Of Daghistan, Baku has 7,000, Kuba 3,572, Darband 9,229, and Tarku 9,000, and besides these there are many villages. Shirvan has a total of 256-581 souls. Karabagh „ 98'614 „ Erivan, Ac. „ 138-311 „ Kars „ 19-000 „ Immeretia „ 127-826 „ Mingrelia „ 37-000 „ Georgia Proper „ 402 - 220 „ So that exclusive of Daghistan, LesgistSn, Abasia, and Guria, of which I have no data, the total population would be 1,079,552. These figures, however, cannot be of much use now. The following extracts from Van Haxthausen's remarks on the Georgians will be interesting:— ' The basis and principles of the organization and general condition of the Georgian people bore great resemblance to those of the Germanic157 GEO race, comprising' a feudal constitution, perfectly analogous to the Romano- Germanic. Under this constitution the nobles who surrounded their King, occupied the first station in the realm. The Georgian nobleman had a purely feudal character; he regarded the sovereign as his lord and chief, whilst the inferior nobles looked up to the higher class as their lords in turn. In the same manner the peasants, though not subjected to bondage under the nobles, were liable to military and seignorial service, tribute, &amp;c. ' The Georgian nobles are divided into three classes,—the Dedebuli, the Tavadi, and the Aznauri. The Dedebuli occupy the highest rank, and may be called the sovereign nobles; according to a legend, they are descended from Karthlos, the first King, who led his family and people into this country, of which he took possession. Karthlos was one of the eight Caucasian patriarchs, the sons of Togarmah, who, according to the Bible, was the great-grandson of Japheth, the son of Noah. Those of the Dedebuli who possessed some stronghold, castle, or small province, assumed the title of Mthawar (afterwards Tavad, or chief of the land); they were the hereditary grandees of the royal court. Many of these grandees filled offices of high importance, as the Spasalar, or chancellor of the realm, who presided over the royal council; the Abramad, or chamberlain of the exchequer; the head of the Msakhurs (life-guards), who was the master of the ordnance and had the superintendence of the arms and ammunition ; and under him were the governors of the fortresses, the general-in-chief of the mercenary troops, the lord marshal, lord high steward, lord chief justice, the Amirakhor (master of the horse), the head falconer, and the Adjib (lord chamberlain), who superintended all persons in attendance at the palace, and who, at the royal banquets, answered for the King, no one being allowed to address the Sovereign personally. Lower in rank were the lord steward, master of the table, the cup-bearer, treasurer, hospitaller, and the cross-bearer, who had the office of inviting the Catholicos and the bishops, and occasion ally also of publishing the sentences passed upon criminals. ' The second class of the nobility are the Tavadi, or princes, probably descended from the Governors of the numerous small provinces. Ihese offices and dignities, became in course of time hereditary. When, for instance, a Governor (Eristav) died, his sword, his war horse, and his eldest son were presented to the King, who conferred the appointment upon the son, if he considered him able and worthy to fill the post, in which case he was girt with his father's sword by the head of the Msakhurs (master of the ordnance) in the King's presence. But if the Sovereign deemed the son incapable of holding the office, he bestowed upon him one for which he was more competent, and the charger was led into the royal stable. ' Many of these Princes at the present day style themselves shortly Eristav, or Governor, thus we meet with a number of Princes Enstav, descended from distinct Tavadi families, of which, in Kartalima and Kakhetia, Piiuce 'Wakhout enumerates sixty-two. &lt; &lt;( The third order of Georgian nobles are the Aznauri. hilst the first two classes were vassals of the King, this was composed of attendants partly of the King, partly of the higher vassals, and partly of the Catho licos and patriarch. No one, however, could bear this title who did not possess a castle or a village, and who could not take the field with horsemen, horses and tents.158 GEO ' Each of these three classes of nobles had their own servants, esquires, or horsemen, military followers, who had a hig-her standing than the peasants, and whose rank varied according to that of the Chiefs whom they served, they were called Mskhuri. The peasants are called Gleks, prisoners of war, or their descendants. The legal position of the nobles in Immiretia, Min- grelia, Georgia, and Suanetia, is the same. Not only do they intermarry exclusively among themselves, but even the several classes of them are kept distinct. The price of blood paid by them in expiation of murder is generally double that paid by the lower classes. ' The proud and warlike Georgians have an aversion to trade and commerce. With a view to elevate trade, the ancient Kings constituted the merchants a separate class, and bestowed on them nearly the same honor as on the lower nobles, the Aznauri. This especially favoured the Armenians, who have been established in the towns of Georgia from time immemorial. There are preserved among them royal diplomas and documents, which date back six centiiries. ' The vassals and followers composing the military force in Georgia Proper were ranged under four banners, in the centre of which was the royal banner of Kartalis. The nation was thoroughly martial, and the Kings deemed it of primary importance to keep a considerable army in pay. ' In this warlike country the Christian hierarchy was constituted in a perfectly analogous manner to the temporal feudal state, with which it was closely connected; the ecclesiastical dignitaries having similar gradations of rank to those of the temporal grandees. The Catholicos or patriarch enjoyed royal honors; next to him was the Archbishop of Dehgondid, who had the care and protection of, and the jurisdiction over, widows and orphans, the unfortunate, and the oppressed, for whom he interceded with the King. In war he bore the sacred cross at the head of the army. He and the prelates of the thirteen convents founded by St. Gregory and his twelve apostolic followers had the rank and honors of the Mthavars; the bishops were equal in rank with the Tavadi and Eristavs, and the priests with the Aznauri. The Mthavars and Tavadi had likewise the right of interment in the cathedrals and abbeys, while the Aznauri were buried in the other churches. The bishops constantly followed to the wars, and administered the communion to the army previous to battle. ' In Georgia, each commune has a Natzvalatits head, who is called in the Georgian language the ' Mamasaglisi,' in Immiretia ' Muchelli,' and in the Tartar villages ' Koweha' (guardian). This officer is elected by the heads of families by a majority of votes, and the Russian manorial Court ratifies the election upon his nomination by the chief of the circle; the landed proprietors of the village have no direct share or influence in this proceeding. The communes possess great freedom, and their affairs are little interfered with by the Government officials. The Natzval retains his office for life, unless he resigns it, or is dismissed in consequence of any legal complaints being brought against him and substantiated by the commune or the magistracy; he is free of personal service and the payment of taxes, and receives a small salary from the commune; the control of the police is in his hands, but all disputes are referred to the chief of the circle. His powers are thus considerable, and in conjunction with the ' white beard^ he has the allotment of the State taxes, which are levied by the Government159 GKO according' to the census; the burden is distributed in proportion to the property each family possesses, and the commune is responsible for the payment. The Natzval also collects the seignorial tithes. The Georgians ordinarily live tog-ether in large families, comprising several generations, on the same farms. ' In those communes which appertain solely to the Crown, without any seignorial peasantry, the Government levies the taxes proportionately to the number of individuals or families ; thus recognizing the principle adopted in Russia, which gives to every member of a parish an equal share and right in the soil. Practically, however, in the parishes in Georgia the soil is always attached to certain farms; indeed, in some parishes, Sartschali, for instance, near the German colony of Marienfeld, in which there exists a distinct classification, similar to that in the north of Germany, peasants, half-peasants, and two classes of cotters. The first class here pos sess seventy dessatinas of land (about 188 acres), the second class has one self this allotment, the third only a small plot of ground, and the fourth merely a house. To the last class are added a number of lodgers, who com monly pay four or five roubles a year. In this part of the country, the Crown receives annually three kod of wheat and barley from each hearth, the Natzval apportioning the gross amount according to the classes. ' In the village of Imaget the land belongs, one-fourth to the Crown, one- fourth to Prince Baratoff, and one-half to a noble, Georgi Kurganoff. The property is said to lie confusedly, so that this distribution is merely ideal, and the Crown in consequence desired to have its portion measured out. ' In former times Georgia was very thinly peopled, and there are still large tracts around many villages uncultivated. The farms have consequently no strict allotments; if, for example, a man dies, leaving a son in his minority, the nearest neighbour takes the seignorial land, with the taxes to which it is liable (in some instances at the instigation of the proprietor himself), and the heir, on coming of age, takes his share from the waste land. 'This insecurity of tenure appears to have increased of late years. Many of the princes and nobles are said to have usurped in this manner extensive possession of the soil; to effect which the Armenians, who are extremely regardless of an oath, are frequently employed; twelve of them, without having any previous knowledge of the matter, are brought together, and take an oath that the land belongs to this or that person to whom it is then adjudicated. ' The land-tax is usually a tenth of the produce, but only in a few places is it paid in kind; that portion which falls on the corn districts is commuted for a fixed payment, but I believe unequally. In some places the crown peasants on each day's work pay one kod of wheat or barley, whichever is on the ground. In a bad year the taxes are remitted, and this of course opens the door to the arbitrary intervention of officials. In other place the Crown demands two kod from every family, levied according to the census; for this the parish is responsible, and the allotment rests with the Natzval. ' In some parts the church and conventual peasants pay the tithe in kind, but on a fixed and moderate scale. In the village of Martkophi there are 200 crown and 120 church peasants. The former pay a tax in wheat and barley, in proportion to the property held; the latter pay no tithes on the land, but a fixed tribute in wax and wine. Forty-one peasants, belong ing to some princes or nobles, are said to be heavily burdened and oppressed;GEO instead o£ a tenth they have to pay a sixth, and even a fifth part of the crops. On New Year's day and at Easter they give small offerings, and everv two or three years, according to their means, sums amounting to from one 'to two hundred roubles are extorted from them. One-fifth of the pro duce of the gardens is paid here; but in many places the gardens, as well as the houses, are the exclusive property of the peasants, for which they pay nothing. , j ij. i. i. ' According to Russian law, a peasant cannot contract debts to a greater amount than five silver roubles, a creditor has no power to recover a larger sum. ' The State taxes here are frequently paid in corn, each house contributing two kod; in Martkophi two roubles are charged. The landlords are obliged to pay these taxes for their peasants, usually at the rate of one or two kod for every house, in the kinds of corn cultivated on the soil. ' The' limits of the parishes, as well as of single fields, are indicated by ancient boundary stones: the paths and roads everywhere lead to these marks. The fields, which are separated by unploughed ridges and furrows, are all attached to their respective farms, and protected by a landguard; in short, it is evident that from a remote period a regular system of land administration has existed here, which has for upwards of a century fallen into decay. Large tracts of country lie waste, and are overgrown with brushwood or forests; the old vineyards have disappeared, the wine cellars lie in rums, haunted only by wild beasts, and the divisions of the land are everywhere ' Traditional rights and customs connected with agriculture are found in all parts of this country; for example, eight or ten yoke of oxen must be put to each plough; farming associations are formed by the regulations ot which one farm has to furnish the plough, another a yoke of oxen, and so on the fields of all the farms are then ploughed regularly in turn. . . A - ' Air, water, pasture, and wood are all public property, according to tradi tional law among the Georgians, and the rights of the chase are free to every one. The forests are indeed nominally divided, and belong to the respective parishes, the nobles, and the crown, but the unrestricted use ot them is open to all. The natural result of this is, that in many parts the forests are devastated, an evil which must necessarily increase. A ukase was inconsequence issued, ordering all the crown forests to be separated trom the rest, and placed under a special administration, steps being taken tor their preservation. This decree however caused such a ferment among the entire population, that in 1842 it was withdrawn. _ ' The live stock of the Georgians consists chiefly of sheep and swine, and their ordinary diet is pork and mutton. Only the poorer classes among these people and the Armenians eat beef, which is of a bad quality; in tact scarcely any part of the ox is eatable, and only the cow's flesh is tolerable. The Persians eat no beef. It has been a matter of wonder that the Georgians have never lapsed into Mahamadanism, although several of their Czars renounced Christianity to maintain their crowns against the Persians, and the Christian Churches in Georgia fell into disuse and decay; one writer attributes the fact to their invincible reluctance to abandon the two staple products of their country, wine and pork. Marienfeld keep no sheep, as in summer they would be obliged to drive them up to the mountains; and having no superfluous herdsmen among themselves, they would have to hire Georgians, in whom they [•lace little confidence. 160101 w GEO—GHA The country-people in Georgia eat, morning and noon, usually a cold meal of bread, greens, celery, leeks, cress, and except in fast-time, milk, sour-milk, and cheese; in the evening they have something warm, usually mutton dressed with celery, and are delighted when they can obtain potatoes from the colonists. The agricultural produce of Georgia consists of cotton, rice, wheat, millet, hemp, and flax. The Georgians do not manure their fields. In May or June the ground is broken up, and in autumn the wheat is sown, without any previous ploughing, and consequently often in grass a foot high: the seed is then bush harrowed into the soil. For two or three years wheat is sown, once perhaps barley, and then the field lies fallow for several years; the manure upon it becomes dried and serves as fuel, which is superior to turf. The meadow land along the Kur is extremely fertile, the ears of wheat and barley yielding from twenty-five to thirty-five fold. Farming stock is a favourite source of wealth with the Georgians; they usually plough with oxen, and a very clumsy plough, to which they yoke eight or ten pan of oxen; and as some of the peasants have not so many beasts, they form associations for ploughing. They trench nearly a foot deep with a furrow 2^ feet in width. The colonist plough only with horses, six or eight to the plough and not more than half a foot deep, but they raise better crops than the Georgians. The wages of farm servants are, for an ordinary laborer, forty to fifty kopecks, an able farm servant gets eight or ten roubles a month, a maid servant four to eight. The Georgians dwelling to the west of Tiflis require help especially at certain seasons of the year, the Immeretians then come down from the mountains and take service with them by the years or month: if the engagement is only by the day, the ordinary pay is 25 kopecks, but in harvest time 40.— [Van Haxthausen—Chesney.)

It is 30 miles long and 12^ miles broad. In the centre is the island of Sevan (containing a monastery), which is three miles in circumference. At the north side of the lake is the deep est part, and here where there is a space of 1,200 yards to the land,GOK soundings are not procurable in 400 feet of water. The lake abounds at all seasons with the finest fish, among- which is the tront. Chesney says the lake is only 1,000 feet in elevation and never freezes, but Eastwick says it is 6,000 feet. It is also called Sevan. Monteith, who made the tour of this lake, g-ives the following interesting- particulars regarding it. He started ' from opposite the island of Jevan going ' along the brow of a precipice which overhangs it for three miles, but on ' which a road has been constructed by the Armenian patriarch practicable for 'carnages. At the fourth mile descended into the valley of ChabakltJ. At 'the eighth, crossed the Palak So stream, near its mouth. For twenty-two ' miles the road continued over a beautiful meadow, when we ascended the ' low range of rocky hills, called the Gum Bakhan. For some time we 'followed a narrow winding path which hung over the water, here 'shallow, and the bottom shelving rocks. After five miles of difficult 'travelling we turned away from the lake into the Phaolat valley ' (steel valley), now covered with the tents of the ShumsadenzQ tribe; and ' seven miles farther encamped at the ruined village of Tokliga, situated in a ' narrow ravine, which runs to the lake, distant three miles. ' We again quitted the banks of the lake, and marched through some fine ' pasture land at the head of the Tersi River; and at the ninth mile we ' reached the summit of the Giller Danish, immediately behind the promon- ' tory of Ada Tippa, which runs a considerable way into the lake, and another ' headland on the opposite side reduces its breadth to six miles. A range of ' rocks is visible from the high ground, extending nearly across, and but little ' below the surface. The promontory of Ada Tippa and the mountain are ' partially wooded. There is considerable extent of fine land on the banks. ' Three miles from this we came abreast of a small lake, situated at the south- ' western extremity of the great one, and communicating with it. Into this 'flows a considerable stream, called the Sogat Sii (or willow stream). We ' ascended it from eight miles to the pass of Yelliga (the winds), which ' divides Erivan from Kara bagh. The Tartar rises near this, in the moun- ' tains of the hot springs, but the rains we were in search of proved to be ' of no consequence, and had no pretensions to having been the site of a ' Roman post. Following the range of mountains for six miles, we came in ' sight of a lake twelve miles in circumference, the banks of which are exceed- ' ingly abrupt and rocky ; from this cause it is called the Black Water, and ' is situated at the foot of the lofty mountains of Dikcha Billekan (the top of ' the ladder). The Armenians consider this as the Tower of Babel, and point ' out the lake as the place from which the earth was dug to raise it. ' A small stream flows out of the Black Lake into the Sevan, but we found ' the ravine impracticable, and crossing a range of hills covered with pasture, ' but totally devoid of wood, entered the Gazell Dara (beautiful valley) and ' encamped at its mouth. The lake here is shallow, with a rocky but level ' bottom; the stream absolutely swarmed with fish, particularly trout, of which ' there are several distinct species, which are said to succeed each other all the 'year. One kind is frequently taken of sixteen to twenty pounds weight, ' and has every appearance of salmon. Besides these there are two kinds of ' mullet, and also carp and barbel. I never saw or heard of pike, perch, or ' eels; dace, gudgeons, and other small fish abound. ' Our party being at last able to move, we proceeded for seven miles along the banks of the lake to the river of Ada \ aman (bad name) by far the 16-i165 GOK—GOL ' largest stream falling into the lake, near which once stood a considerable ' Armenian town. Convents and churches were thickly scattered on the sur- ' rounding hills. Three miles from this, on the shores of the lake, is the ' camp occupied for two months by Nadir Shah. The intrenchments are still ' visible, and it appears to have been placed with regularity. Near it a small ' rock has been pierced to allow a stream to run through, but for what purpose ' it is impossible now to ascertain. We still followed the lake to the stream of ' Kabar, where a headland runs a considerable way out, opposite to the pro- ' montory of Ada Tippa, which reduces the breadth of the water to six miles. ' High perpendicular cliffs of lava here prevent the passage near the lake, ' and our horses suffered much from the steepness of the stones. We were ' struck with the vast quantity of obsidian scattered over the country. At ' Ak Kala we again approached the lake, and found the shore covered with ' very light pumic stone, which floated on the water. We rounded a deep ' bay, came to the spot where a branch of the Zengue flows out of the lake. ' That river derives but a small portion of its waters from this source, which is 'said to be artificial. That, however, I do not believe; at the same ' time the ravine, having a very rapid fall, the quantity of water could ' be augmented at pleasure, and, if it served any purpose, a considerable part ' of the lake be thus drained.' 'We were now very near the island of Sevan, from which we had set out, ' having measured by perambulator or chain the whole distance. The great- ' est length is from Chabaklu, bearing south-east to Sogat Sii (forty-seven 'miles) ; the breadth varies much : at Ak Kala it is sixteen miles; at Ada 'Tippa, six; and the greatest, from Nadir Shah's Camp to Patriarch Bund, ' twenty-one. The latitude of the island of Sevan is 40° 30' 30', but the ' lake extends to 40° 37' Lb' : the southern extremity is in 40° 9' 40 // . Water ' boiled on its banks at 202°, or 5,300 feet above the level of the sea. It was 'partially frozen in the month of January 1813. I cannot offer an opinion ' from whence the great and well-marked volcanic remains could originate, ' but it is evidently from no great distance. Where there is soil, it is light and ' of the richest quality. The Russian Government have, I believe, the inten- 'tion of removing 20,000 families of Cossacks to the banks of this lake, ' and the range of mountains on the frontiers of Georgia.'— [Monteith— Chesney—Eastwich.)

A small lake in the Pashalic of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, a few miles south west from Kharput, situated between the mountains known as Batman, Dagh, and Deva Boyan which overlook the plain of KharpQt. Its extreme length from east and by north to west and by south is barely 10 miles, and it may have at most about 4 miles of breadth. It is surrounded by high hills which come down into its waters, but there is a small open space on the east. The temperature of the water was found by Brant to be 68°, the air being 80°, and is remarkably soft being almost entirely free from lime and mag nesia salts. On its south side is a village of 20 Kurds houses and a larger one called Goljik of 50 Christian houses. There are also some 8 or 10 houses on the north side, a village about 6 miles to the west, and Kiszim about 1^ miles to the east. The villages of Goljik have a boat.

A village in Province of Arzriim, Asiatic Turkey, 68 miles south of Arzrflm, on the road to Mtlsh, from which it is 35 miles distant. It is situated in a pretty valley at the south foot of the Bingol Tagh. This village is an endowment to a mosque, and the inhabitants enjoy immunity from Skli- yaneh and from a contribution to the regular troops and militia. It con tains 30 Kurd and 15 Armenian families. There is a good deal of cultivation in this valley, and the soil is rich rendering twelvefold in good seasons.— {Brant.) GUMISH KHANA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Arzrnm, Asiatic Turkey, 50 miles south of Tarabizun, 110 miles west of Arzrum on the left bank of the Kharshut Chai. It is singularly situated, being inclosen in a basin by bare granite rocks. The houses are grouped in the form of an amphitheatre on the declivity of the mountain which is exceedingly steep. The houses of the town are built of mud and stone and present a dirty and miserable appearance. Three miles distant from this town are mines of argentiferous lead. They were once rich in silver, but the produce now is very small, this being occasioned rather by the system pursued by the Government than the want of ore. At one time there were forty furnaces in full employment, now there are only two. The whole distiict abounds in ores of copper and lead: a few mines are • worked, and those which are produce little to the Government from the ruinous system of management pursued. » In the'Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29 a Russian detachment, under Count Simonitch, occupied this place without resistance, the Turkish garrison , flying and the Greeks employed to guard the miners moving out in proces sion to meet the Russians.— {Monteith—Wiigner—Stuart Brant.) GtMRL—Lat. Long. Elev. A town and fortress in Georgia, on the left bank of the Arpah Chai, 25 miles east from Kars. It is a bustling little town containing 1,200 houses. The fortress is situated on a plateau elevated 1,200 feet above the surround ing country. It is distant about a mile from the Arpah Chai, the small stream dividing Russia from Turkey and running north and south, is a ravine which may be considered the ditch of the west face of the fortress. The east face is guarded in a similar way by a ravine 100 feet deep and 150 feet in width at the bottom of which runs a rivulet. The fortress is about one mile in length from north to south and about 2 mile in breadth. W hen Shiel visited it in 1838, it was intended to connect the above two faces by a great ditch on the north side, but it was not known if the south was to be defended in a similar manner. The ground in this direction is rugged, and the south front was protected by a bomb-proof casemated battery mount ing 16 guns, constructed of dark soft volcanic rock which hardens on exposure to the air. It was said to be intended to surround the whole plateau on which the fortress stands with a rampart lo feet high and 20 feet in thickness. In addition to these works it was in contemplation to construct a citadel in the centre of the plateau of the same materials as the casemated battery with extensive bomb-proof barracks.— {Skeil.)

A province of Caucasia, (one half of which belongs to Russia, and the other to Turkey,) on the east shore of the Black Sea; having Mingrelia and Imeretia north, Akhalzik and the Pashalic of Tarabizun south and east, and the Black Sea west. Its area is about 900 square miles. This district is chiefly forest; and the soil is very fertile. The inhabitants are chiefly Georgians, with a few Armenians. It is the most fertile country in all Caucasia, the land, though never manured, yields two harvests. In the autumn the soil is lightly turned with a double pointed plough drawn by two oxen, wheat is then sown and is harvested in April. After this the land is again ploughed and bush-harrowed previous to sowing maize or millet, which is cut in September. Tobacco is also cultivated. The country is hilly, the farms lie isolated and generally on a gentle slope. The farmsteads occupy a large space of ground, usually enclosed by a hedge or boarded fence, and the buildings stand under the shade of magnificent walnut trees, chesnuts, and planes. Gardens and vineyards surround the home, and beyond these are fields of maize and millet all carefully hedged in. The entire extent of ground occupied by buildings and fields in each farm varies from 4 to 8 dessatinas. But a number of farms have frequently fields in common regularly surveyed and shared among them, each having on an average from 8 to 12 dessatinas of land. A certain aggregate of these farms (not less than 20, but often 2 to 300) form a village commune and 2 to 4 constitute a church commune. The religion of the Gurians is that of the Greek church, and the classes of the people are princes, nobles, peasants. It is divided into two districts, each having a town of the same name, viz., Ozurget and Nagomar. The sovereigns of this principality are descendants of the Georgian dynasty, and they remained vassals to the Ottoman Porte from the 16th century to the treaty of Adrianople. Previously to that treaty being made the finest timber of the country was floated along the Black Sea in rafts to supply the arsenal at Constantinople. In the war of 1828-29 Guria was occupied by a Russian detachment under General Ilesse, who was welcomed by the people.— [Van Haxthausen— Imperial Gazetteer—Monteith—Chemey.) H. HABAB—Lat. Long. Elev.

HAKARI— A great tribe of Northern Kurdistan, who inhabit the mountains on either bank of the great Zab River above Amadiah. Their country is bounded north by the Ardish Tagh and the Province of Van, east by the V5171 HAK The following is Ainsworth's estimate of the population of Hakarl, founded upon personal observation of the various sizes of the villages and of the reports as to their number. It differs very much indeed from others previously published; but these have been founded chiefly upon oriental exaggerations. The fallacy of Dr. Walsh's estimate of 500,000 Christians, for example, must be manifest to all who will consider the small extent of country occupied by these Christians and its limited productive capabilities:— 1.

' Their country is a congregation of rugged ravines, covered with jungle, but interspersed here and there with fertile plains, which yield an abundant return to the labourer and pasture for their numerous flocks. They dislike and suspect all strangers, whom they consider as spies and interlopers. They obey none but their respective Chiefs, and are not very exclusive in, for they strip indiscriminately every one they catch. Even other tribes of Ktirds if not too powerful to be touched, are not always safe. It is said that no power has ever reduced this country to subjection.' (See also Kurds, Kurdistan.) Rich contributes the following items of information regarding the Hakarls. ' The country is exceedingly precipitous and difficult. Ihe in habitants wilder than any of the Kurds. Their huts are built of logs. They wear hats resembling European hats made of rice straw. They are unacquainted with wheat and barley, and cultivate only rice, of which they make bread. In person they are more than ordinarily tall and stout.' ' The Chief of the Hakari, says Monteith, can collect 25,000 men, but very few would follow him out of their own country. They are chiefly infantry, and the few horsemen he has are not much esteemed. Their whole country is covered with small forts generally built on an eminence, at the foot of which is a collection of miserable huts for their peasantry. r Ihe Chief appears to have little or no authority. His capital is Julamarg. Tb 6 Hakans are supposed to be tributary to the Province of ^ an, but this is purely nominal.' Rawlinson thinks the Hakari country might be visited if precaution was taken to work through their Chiefs, and that hostages were given in exchange; it was probably from the neglect of these precautions that the traveller Schultz was murdered by these people.— [Ainsworth—Rawlinson Fraser Rich—Mo nteitk.)HAK—HAR I1AKIAR—Lat.

HAMADAVAND. A tribe of Kurds, who inhabit the vicinity of the Sag-arma Pass on the road from Sulimania to Bag-hdad. They do not number more than 5 or 600 families, but are said to have made themselves extremely feared by the boldness of their bearing and the frequency of their raids on their neig-h- bours, particularly the Taf tribe of Kurds.— [Fraser.) HAMAMLtJ.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Russian Armenia east of Gumn and on the bank of the Pambek River. It has but a few habitations, and is famous for being the scene of one of Abbas Mirza's defeats.— [Morier.) HAMR1N.—Lat. Long. Elev. A range of hills in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, north of Baghdad. None of the numerous authorities who mention these hills seem to have much idea as to what they are. Jones is clearest in his statement, describing them ' as an undulating barren ridge of tertiary formation from 300 to 500 feet of elevation extending in a direction from south-east to north-west across the level plains of Assyria. The ridge appears to be a spur thrown off from the skirts of the Zagroschain in the neighbourhood of Mendali, and can be traced in almost a direct line to within a short dis tance of Al-Hudhr. It is severed by the Tigris, Adheym, and by the Didla. That portion of the range west of the Tigris bears the name of Sabl Ma- khul, and is considerably more elevated than the parts to the south-east.' I cannot agree with this authority in considering the hills which run at right angles to the above named rivers as one range. I think it much more probable that though apparently running, as Captain Jones says, from south east to north-west in one continuous line, they are really each separate spurs from the Kurdistan hills. Mr. Ainsworth says the Hamrin are formed of tertiary red sandstones, gypsum, and conglomerates.— [Jones, fyc) HARAKOL.—Lat. Long. Elev.

The modern town is perched on the top of a steep and nearly inaccessible rock, having at the east end an old castle. In a small plain at the foot of the mountains, which here press down upon the Tigris, are the ruins of the old town. Below the to\vn are the ruins of a noble bridge of three large and three smaller pointed arches which here formerly spanned the river.— [Taylor?) HASAN KALA—Lat. 39° 58' 55' Long. 41° 43' 40.' Elev. 5,505. A town in the Province Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, 18 miles east of Arzrum, on left bank of the Murts river, a tributary of the Aras. The town is now quite in ruins, but is surrounded by a modern double wall which connects it with the castle. This is built on a projecting rock, occupying the oblong summit of spur thrown out from the main range and rising about 1,600 feet above the plain. The summit of the rock is defended by a turreted wall of stone, another wall surrounds it about half way down, and in some places a third descend to the base, both these last uniting, as above mentioned, with the double walls of the town. The castle, though otherwise strong, is commanded by a hill behind. The rock, though defiladed by nature, is not sufficiently so. Hasan Kala is the seat of the Beg of Upper Pasin, who is dependent on Arzrum, and is inhabited by about 4,000 Turks and 1,000 Armenians. The only ornament of the town is a handsome stone bridge over the Murts said to have been built in the reign of Darius Hystaspes. On the opposite side of the river facing the town there are innumerable hot springs, some are bituminous, but others appear to contain iron and lime. The hottest are 105° Fahrenheit. There are two baths built over the hottest and most copious sources both constantly filled with bathers. The town contains seven mosques and seven fountains most of which are more or less dilapidated. It is situated at the point where the roads from Bayazid, Kars, Arzrum, and Akhiska meet, and is therefore a position of some strategical importance. It was captured by the Russians under Paskitwitz in the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29 without resis tance, and formed afterwards one of their principal depots. Hasankala is the first station ever occupied by the famous Janissaries who were first raised in this part of the country. It is also reported to have been a Genoese Station.— [Kinneir—Ouseley—Brant—Stuart—Bickson—Glasscott.)174 HAT—HER HATEM TA1 KALA.—Lat. Long*. Elev. An ancient and now ruined fort in the Province o£ Mflsal, Asiatic Turkey, 50 miles north-east of Nisi bin, situated on a hill in a mountain gorg-e overlook ing- the plain near Bazara villag-e. The position is strong, and considerable pains have evidently been lavished to make this fort as impregnable as possible; and at points where it seemed easy of access the rock has been cut away, and inclines made steep and inaccessible by means of masonry. The principal buildings are constructed upon a rock that springs out of the summit of the hill and some extensive reservoirs for water, of great depth, were scooped out of the rock and then arched over with stone work. The whole is encircled by a strong wall, and some little way from and below it another wall following the contour of the hill surrounds the first. It is further strengthened and isolated bv cutting through the rock as an entrance. {Taylor.) HAT1L DARA StT.—Lat. Long. Elev.

In the centre of the town a large spring, 200 feet in circumference, enclosed by masonry, supplies the town, gardens, and splendid clover fields with beautiful clear cold water, and it then emerges into the plain and forms the River Ambar SQ.—(Taylor.) HILLAH.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the site of the ancient city of Babylon, 54 miles south of Baghdad, on the River Euphrates It ex tends along both banks of the Euphrates, about two-thirds of it being on the right bank, and though sadly shattered has externally a neat and rather inviting appearance. The two parts are joined together by a bridge of 28 boats about 450 feet long, with a moveable one in the centre to admit of the passage of boats on the river, which is here 18 feet deep. The town is built entirely of brick cemented with lime or mud. It has no large or ele gant public structures. The houses are low with flat roofs, and their inner court is generally below the level of the streets and lanes which abound with filth. The bazaars are extensive, but are mostly occupied with coffee- shops, and nothing in the shape of European manufactures exist in them. They are, however, well supplied with meat, fish, rice, and even luxuries ; the city is regularly governed, and is in general quiet, peaceable, and particularly well disposed towards strangers and Franks. It is inhabited by Arabs, Persians, and Turks and Jews, all amounting to about 10,000, which is very small compared with the ground it occupies. Beyond and within the walls, which are considerably decayed and unfit for the purposes of defence, are numerous gardens, all irrigated by the waters of the Euphrates. In these wheat, barley, melons, cucumbers are cultivated along with date and fruit trees. Many of them are the residence of Arabs living in tents of black cloth. Small vessels lie below the bridge usually, and the ancient round boat formed of reeds or oziers coated with bitumen, about 10 feet in diameter, and worked with one paddle, is still to be seen plying in the neighbourhood of the townHIL—HOK just as it is described by Herodotus, and seems to be well adapted for ferry ing- across the strong current without losing- much distance. The view, at Hillah, both up and down the river, though not very extensive, being varied with houses and date groves intermingled, is pleasing, from its verdure and the life it receives from the water and the boats.

A canal in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which leaves the right bank of the Euphrates between Mussayib and Hillah, and flows south until it spreads out into extensive marshes west of Birs Nimriid, and after passing Kufa it falls into the great inland sea, the Bahr-i-Nedjef. When greatly flooded the Euphrates frequently forces open a new passage or enlarges that previously existing at the entrance of the Hindieh j thus a considerable por tion of its stream is diverted from the river, and it is necessary to restrain this efflux by dams at the point of bifurcation.— [Loftus.)

A town in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Euphrates. It contains about 1,500 houses built all round an elongated hill rising from, and parallel to, the right bank of the river. The houses are chiefly of clay, one or two stories high, flat-roofed, and many of them covered or re paired' on the top with bitumen. The streets are narrow and dirty, and fre- quentlv steep, rising one above the other along the side of the hill, with a duty black appearance owing to the smoke from the constantly boiling bitumen. The hill and town are enclosed by a high mud wall with semi-circular towers, but there is no ditch. One graceful minaret appears amidst this mass of brown clay, and some respectable specimens of arabesque architecture are displayed in some of the Saints' tombs, a little way outside the town, where the scenery is that of brown, barren hills, and a desert country. Little or no grain is cultivated near Hit; the inhabitants prepare a good deal of wool, but their chief occupation is boat-building, burning lime, making salt, and preparing bitumen, nafti, &amp;c., great quantities of each being sent to Hillah, Baghdad, Basra, and other places, the nafti finding its way even to India. The celebrated springs of bitumen are near Gasar Sadi on the left bank, the sources of which seem as permanent as a source of water. A bridge of boats has been thrown across the river at this point for the passage of the caravans of Baghdad and Aleppo.— {Chesney Kinneiv.) HOGASTJR-Lat. Long. Elev.

A river, affluent of the Tigris, formed by two branches. The north or Ab-i- Holwan branch rises on the west face of the great chain of the Zagros, about eight miles north of the pass called the gates of Zagros, and bursts at once into a full stream, which is swollen by many additions as it pursues its course nearly west by south down the romantic and beautiful glen of Kijab to Zohab; and onward to the remarkable ruins at the chasm and pass of Sar Pul-i-Zohab. After receiving at Mula Yakub, six miles from the latter, the .Ab-i-DciS stieam, which flows from the south-east past the ruins of Dera, the Holwan pursues a west course to Kasr-i-Sharin, where it turns south, and at a distance of 10 miles further on this direction it is joined by the south branch called the Ab-i-Gilan, which comes from beyond the village of Gilan, a distance of about 40 miles to the north-west. The direction of the united stream, which still preserves the name of Holwan, is a little south of west; in this line it continues to Khamkin, about 12 miles from the junction above mentioned; and at an equal distance from thence in the same direction it falls into the greater branch, the Ab-i-Shirwan at Kizl Robat, whence the river is known as the T&gt;\h \si .—{Chesnei /—liawlinson~ Jones.)

It is a considerable town with a few date trees and a g-arden 5 or two, and is built on the undulating mounds which form the east margin of the valley of the Tigris. There is a tomb here, in shape a cone, with 178179 IMA—IMM a square base, which is a place of pilgrimage.

IMM ERE TIA—Lat. 41 o 30' to 42 0 45 Long. 41 o 30 / to 43 C W Elev. A district of Georgia bounded north by the Caucasus, east by Georgia, south by Kars, west by Mingrelia. Its length from the borders of Akhlts Khai to the main ridge of the Caucasus is 4^ miles, and its mean width from the sea to the mountain ridge separating it from the borders of Georgia is 75 miles, it has, therefore, superficies of 3,150 square miles. Its popula tion amounts to 127,826 persons, chiefly Immeretians, but mixed with about 4,000 Armenians, Ossetians, and Jews. It is well watered by the Rion or Phasis and its tributaries, and being sheltered by the Caucasus on the north, the climate is mild. Although mountainous, the country yields the products of warm climates; but in certain places the forests engender malaria, and the Russian Garrisons are said to suffer great mortality from this cause, losing some years as much as one-fourth of their number. It is divided into the districts of Kutais, Vahi, Shoropan, and Rachi, each of which is locally governed by an intendant who is assisted by two native oflicers. Kutais is the chief place. In Immeretia they use clumsy four-wheeled carts. Hardly any corn is grown, but maize and a remarkable species of millet called khomi. The houses of the Immeretians are generally loghouses, con structed of cross beams laid one upon another. There is a door at each gable end of the building, and sometimes the gable projects five or six feet, resting upon pillars. Separate sheds are set apart for the cattle. The build ings are all surrounded by a fenced enclosure, and generally guards are seen climbing up the walls and trailing gracefully upon the roof. Immeretia has a general slope west to the Black Sea, but it is mostly very uneven and rugged, being traversed by ramification of the Caucasus. All the higher mountain slopes are covered with magnificent forests, many of the loftier valleys afford luxuriant pasture, and in the lower grounds, notwith standing the indolence of the inhabitants, heavy crops of wheat, barley, maize, tobacco, hemp, and madder are raised. Fruit trees grow spontaneously, and chesnuts, walnuts, apricots, and cherries, &amp;c., are found in abundance in every quarter. The vine also is said to grow spontaneously, and is often found entwining itself with the trees of the forest. Domestic animals are not numerous, but game is very abundant. Considerable attention is paid to the rearing of bees and silk-worms. There are no manufactures worthy of the name, and the trade almost wholly in the hands of the Armenians, Greeks, and Jews, and consists chiefly on the exports of the raw produce of the country particularly wine, corn, silk, wax, skins, wool, and fruit, and imports of woollen, linen and silk goods, copper and iron ware, cutlery, salt, and colonial produce. The trade in slaves, males for the army, and females for the harems of the Turks, was once the most important of all, but it has been put down by the Russians. Immeretia iu the 14th180 IMM—ISF century formed part of the kingdom of Georgia. It afterwards became independent and was governed by its own sovereigns, one of whom in 1804 voluntarily made it over to Russia. The total population amounts to about 81,000 souls.— [Chesney—Kinnier—Monteith—/ an llaxthausen Imperial Gazetteer.) INGAR.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Mmgrelia, Georgia, which rising on the Caucasus falls into the Black Sea, just north of Anaklia. The navigation of this river is much obstructed by rocks and trees overthrown in its current and by dangerous eddies.— [J an Haxthausen.) INGUSHES.— . A tribe of the Caucasus who inhabit the country near the Ossetians. They speak a dialect of the Midzschegsch language, and appear to be of the same origin as the Tchetchens. They are not accounted so brave as the other Caucasian tribes. Only a small number of them are JNIahamadans, and they are not so fanatical as the Lesgis and Tchetchen. In fact they appear to be indifferent in regard to their religion, although they practice some secret religious ceremonies. KJaproth, who remained some time in then countly, maintains that the Ingushes, whom he calls a free and independent people, have a peculiar religion, and are equally averse to Christianity and Islamism. Their god is called ' Dale/' Their priest is always an old man of upright life whom they name ' Zanin Stag/' which means u pureman, and who kills the victims for sacrifice. Sometimes the Ingushes make pilgrimages to the ruins of the Christian Churches existing in this mountains. The Ingushes frequentlv borrow their names from animals, some are called dog (Ion), others pig (Hoka), and the women have still more singular names, foi instance ' Assir Wachara' (who rides a calf).— {Wagner.) INSPECTOR'S CHANNEL.—Lat. Long. Elev. A gut at the head of the Persian Gulf, which runs out of the easternmost mouth of the Shat-al Arab into Khor Gufgah. It has a fathom and a quarter in it at low water, and at high is very narrow, especially where it enters the channels. It runs parallel with the shore, commencing about a mile and a half below the eastern point of the river. In case of necessity a small vessel being driven into Khor Gufgah in a south-easter, and parting from her cables might run for it at high water, but it is not to be recom mended except in cases of necessity.— [Brucks.)

A small seaport town in Syria, district of Alexandretta, on the south-east coast of the Gulf of Iskandarun; the houses are in general extremelv mean-looking, but some recent erections have given a rather more res pectable appearance to the town. These include the residence of the English Vice-Consul, and some granaries built by Ibrahim Pasha. The town is surrounded by marshes, which render it very unhealthy, but it is now less so than formerly, in consequence of one of the largest having been thoroughlv drained some years ago. The others being all above the level of the sea might be very easily drained to the great advantage of the port. The latter consists of a fine bay, running in south east from the Gulf, protected from all winds, and capable of containing in security from 30 to 35 sail. Being the natural port of Aleppo, and of all north of Syria, the greater portion of both British and foreign imports and exports pass through it. The direct importations consist principally of grain, rice, and salt. The staple articles of export are galls, silk, cotton, and dips, or beshmet, made from grapes into a consistence resembling honey, and which forms a great article of food among the natives of the country. The inhabitants of Alexandretta are about half Greeks and half Turks and Fellahs.— [Imperial Gazetteer?) J. J A FARAN.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Ktlrdistan, south of Sulimanla and close to the foot of the Sagrama Pass, one of the principal gates of Kurdistan in this quarter. [Fraser.) J1FS— A tribe of Kurdistan who chiefly inhabit the country about Shahrazor, and are scattered all along the south border line of the mountains west of Senna and east of Svilimania, and are subject to Turkey. They are said to muster some 10,000 to 12,000 families or tents, and to be able to furnish the Pasha of Salimani with 6,000 good horsemen. They are the most warlike and unruly of all the Ktlrdish tribes. Rich says of them they are a fine-looking brave people, but are esteemed exceedingly uncivilized and barbarous even by the Kurds. Their dialect of Kurdish differs considerably from that of the Bebbeh Kurds and their appearance is so singular that they are easily recognised. They form a body182 JAF—JAN o£ yeomanry cavalry in number about 2,000, which follows the Bey when he is summoned to attend his feudal lord, the Pasha of Sulimania, in the field. They can also turn out 4,000 musketeers with ease, and they are reckoned the best soldiers in the Kurdish army. As they are a strong- and powerful tribe, they have a number of refugees from various tribes with remnants Df broken tribes under their protection, such as the leilhs and Kalhores. When the Chief dies if the son is young he does not succeed, as the clan could never be governed by a stripling. In that case the vacant Chieftainship is filled by the brother or uncle of the deceased Bey. The Jafs all live in tents. In the summer they encamp in the high moun tains of Haji Ahmad on the frontier of Sehna: in the autumn they are scattered over the district of Shahrazor, and in the winter they live at IShir- wan, on the river Diala. The Chief of the Jafs is nearly absolute, but cannot kill or mutilate with out consulting the elders of the tribe. If the Pasha requires a sum of money or a levy of troops from him, he summons the Chiefs of the different branches and divides the burden equally among them, while they do the same with the principal people of their own branches.— [Fraser Ferrier Hick.) JAGHAT—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the district of Guriel, in Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Chorak Su. The houses of this place are scattered amongst the woods which surround it. A\ heat is not grown here, but Indian-corn, millet, and some rice are cultivated ; the winters are not severe, but the summers and autumns are wet, and on that account the harvest often fails, .bruits of the commoner sort are abundant and good, and grapes enough are grown to make wine.— {Brant.) JAGHJAGHA—Lat. Long. £ley. A river of the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, which rising in the south slopes of the Jabl Tura falls into the Khabur, a few miles belo\v Nisibm in the latitude of Sinjar. Above the town of Nisibin, where it emerges from the hills, the Jaghjagha has been divided into several small streams for irrigating the large cotton and rice plantations in the neighbour hood. From carelessness in irrigation a great quantity of the water escapes and forms large marshy plots, which in summer and autumn emit pesti lential exhalations producing very pernicious fevers. In those seasons it is shunned by the Bedouins, who, however, flock there in winter and spring to obtain their necessary supplies and to dispose of their produce.— [Taylor Chesney.) JALALl— A tribe of Kurds who inhabit the mountains in the Province of Bayazid, Asiatic Turkey. {Stuart.) JAMAS HLl—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Kars, Asiatic Turkey, 20 miles east of Kars, on left bank of Kars Chai River. It is a large village inha-bited by a mixed population of Turks, Persians, and Armenians, and has in its centre a small stone tower, built as a security against the attacks of the Kurdish tribes when they were in occupation of this part of the country.— {Abbott.) JANREZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Kurdistan on the road between Siilimania and Kujri. It is a miserable place, though the residence of the Chief of the Daln Kurds, a branch of the Bebehs of Sulimania.— {Fraser.)183 JAU—JEZ JARBAE—Lat. Long. Elcv. A tribe of Arabs, who inliabit a portion of the A1 Jazira in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, wandering fromKerkeria to Baghdad. They are de scribed as a very powerful and licentious tribe, and came originally from Nejd. During the reign of Ali Pasha, this tribe came down and invested Baghdad for three months, and then only retired from scarcity of forage.— (A' inneir.) JAWAK TAGH—Lat. Long. Elev.

Elev. A range of hills in Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which Jones terms a continuation on the right bank of the Tigris of the Hamrin Hills. 1 think, however, it is more likely to be a spur of the Sinjar Hills. The range is composed of sand-stone and pebbles without a blade of vegeta tion, and has an elevation of about 500 feet.— {Jones.) JEBL TUR—Lat. Long. Elev. A spur of the great Taurus Range, which forms the watershed of the Tigris from Mardin to its south bend opposite of Jezireh ibn-Umar. It is a continuation of the Karajah Tagh, and is itself continued in the Sinjar Hills. JEV1ZLIK—Lat. Long. Elev. A small village in the Province of Tarabizin, Asiatic Turkey, south of Tarabizin, on a small stream. It is described as a beautiful spot, at the junction of a stream with the Darmendara, a high pointed bridge over this last being a very picturesque object. Shiel remarks that it would be hard to conceive a more lovely spot than this. A most romantic looking castle perched on a steep rock overlooks the stream and guards the pass. Woods and verdure clothe the hills and moun tains to the top intermingled with cultivated lands, villages, and detached farm houses. If the sea were visible, it is a question whether the road from Leghorn to Genoa would afford a liner sight.— {Stuart—Shiel.) JEZIREH—Lat. Long. Elev. The plain country situated between the Tigris and Euphrates above Baghdad is thus named.— {Loftus.) JEZ1REH-IBN-FARS—Lat. Long. Elev.

JEZIREH-IBN-TJMAR—Lat. Long. Elev. 900. An island of the Tigris, 60 miles below the junction of the east and west branches of that river in the Province of Misal, Asiatic Turkey. It is formed by the river, branching a short distance above and joining below. The east branch is the largest, the west being only a few yards in breadth,184 JEZ—JUL and ancle deep iu August. The town of JezTreh is built on this island, which is about two and a half miles in circumference and occupies nearly the whole of it. It is of an oval shape, and is surrounded by low walls in ruins in many places and without a ditch, and faced with square black stones. From the low situation of the town in the bed of the river, and from the heat of the banks the heat is extreme, and not a single tree is to be seen on the island on its vicinity. It was once a commercial depot for goods passing into Armenia as well as by water to Misal. Jezireh is famous for its manufac ture of a striped cotton cloth, which is used for the head or waist. The Tigris was formerly spanned at this point by two fine stone bridges. Of the one near the town no vestiges beyond pieces of the buttresses exist, but of the second, which was some way below it, an entire arch near the right bank still exists. This town is on the line of telegraph between Constan tinople and Baghdad, and there is an office here, it was the capital of the Kurdish district of Buthan, but was taken by the Turks under Kashid Pasha in 1884-35. Mr. MacDonald Kinnneir was imprisoned and heavily fined by the Bey of this place in 1809.— [Chesney—Shiel—Taylor—Go Ids mid—Rick—Kinneir.) JILBAH—Lat. Long. Elev. An island in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of Euphrates between Hadisah and Hit, 40 miles below Anah.

A range of hills in the Province of Misal, Asiatic Turkey, to the south of Misal. They are probably a continuation of the Jebl Tur. They are com posed of gypsum and lacustrine and marine deposits, and are from six to nine miles in width. In April they are covered with beautiful vegetation, and grass is used by the Arabs as pasture grounds.— [Ainsworth), Jl BEYR—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruined castle on the right bank of the Tigris, a short way (three miles) below the junction of the Maden and Dibeneh branches of that river. It is situated on the top of a mass of perpendicular rock that crops out of the summit of a high hill, a spur of the mountain range here. The south por tion on which the fort is built has been separated by a deep and broad cutting, 120 feet long, 60 feet deep, and 30 feet wide at the weakest point of the main range, so as to have ensured it against any sudden capture by escalade. This point is further fortified by a huge mass of solid brickwork, rising to a height of many feet, which in the shape of a wall follows the irregula rity of the whole summit of the mound, enclosing an area of 400 yards long with a breadth varying from 20 to 40 yards.— [Taylor). JtJDl TAGH—Lat. Long. Elev. See Jebl Judi. JT j LAMARG —Lat. 37° 8' Long. 43° 38' Elev. 5,400. A town, the capital of the Hakari, district of Kurdistan, on the right bank of the Zab River, 50 miles north-north-east of Amadia. The castellated part consists of a massive building, and forms the residence of the Beg; to the east is a central square court with round towers at the angles, and a few stray houses irregularly detached, occupy, to the west, the crest of a low cliff, which rises with precipitous sides from out of the collection of185 z JUL —KAD mud hovels about 200 in number that nearly encircle the castle, hill, and constitute the town of Julamarg'. In other respects it is situated in a deep hollow on the Kiirdistan upland in a ravine by which the rivulets of the districts, of which there are many, find their way into the Zab flowing 1 immediately below. To the east is a bold rocky mountain called Shembat, which is at least 3,000 feet above Julamarg, and beyond rise the still loftier summits of Jellu or Jawur Tagh; the highest mountains of this part of Kurdistan, and probably only equalled by the Maranan Mountains, the nearest of its summit to Julamarg, is called Galila. To the south-west rise a rock of limestone about 600 feet high, bearing a ruined castle designated Kalla Baroa. Around and especially to the north-west is seen some cultivation with a few villages. Monteith says the access to Julamarg from every side is almost impracticable.— [Ainsworth.) JULAMARGI— A division of the Hakari tribe of Kurdistan.

Formerly it was undoubtedly a place of much more importance, but since its inhabitants were deputed to the vicinity of Ispahan by Shah Abbass, it has remained in a state of extreme poverty and ruin.— [Ouselet/.) K. KABARDAH—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Russia situated on the north of the Caucasus, separated on the north by the Terek from the Government of Caucasus, bounded on the south by the country of the Ossetes, and west by Little Abkasia. It is partly covered by some north ramifications of the Caucasus, has a mild climate, fine meadows, a fertile soil, and raises cereals and legumes, and depastures great numbers of horses, cattle, sheep, and goats. The country is usually divided into Great and Little Kabardah, the former the west, the latter the east portion.— [Impe rial Gazetteer.) KABARDINSK—Lat. Long, Elev. A port on the coast of the Black Sea, in Abkasia. The shores of the Black Sea here are uncommonly beautiful, the mountains presenting the finest forms and outline, while here and there in the far distance appear on the horizon the snowy glaciers. Luxuriant vegetation and noble forests stretch down to the sea shore.— {Van Haxthausen.) KADAPHA—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Tarabizim, Asiatic Turkey, on left bank of the Cho- rak Su, and 24 miles above BatfSm. It consists of about 200 houses inhabited186 KAD entirely by Mahamadans; about one-half of these are close to the Chorale and the remainder scattered in the neighbouring ravine through which runs a torrent into the Chorak called the KSra Dara Su. The inhabitants of Ka- dapha collect a little wax and honey, and grow a small quantity of wheat and barley, but owing to the mountainous nature of the country in the neighbourhood the produce is insufficient for their consumption, and they resort to Batum in the winter to gain their livelihood by labour. [Guarra- cino.) KADHIMIN—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, three miles above Baghdad and on the right bank of the Tigris. It is a celebrated place of pilgrimage for Mahamadaus of the Shia persuasion on account of Imam Musa-al- Kathem, the seventh, and his grandson, Mahamad Taki, son of Ali Raza, the eighth Imam being buried here. The gilded domes and handsome minarets of the tomb form objects of great beauty as they stand out in relief against the sky beyond, and high above, and in glittering contrast with the sombre date-groves around them; a nearer approach, however, displays the real charaeter of the religion and its votaries. The really handsome mausoleum is enriched with the bare and crumbling walls of wretchedly-built houses, mostly of mud and rotten bricks, that form the town, which is inhabited by Arabs and Persians, with a sprinkling of Indians of the Shia sect that have been exiled from their country for political offences, or have strayed here from a feeling of sanctity combined with a wish to prey upon their fellow pilgrims. The tomb is numerously visited from all parts of the Mahamadan world, where Ali and his race are the peculiar objects of vene ration. Pomp and beggary, silk and rags, are seen jostling each other in the Court of the mosque, and a halo-like fanaticism, dangerous alike to the Christian or the Jew, renders access to it impossible by these sects. Suffi cient, however, is seen of the building to cause regret that but few edifices of the like architectural beauty and ornament are met with in a country where such a style is adopted. The minarets and square encompassing the dead are elaborately enamelled in a rich mosaic work, and the walls are also adorned with legends from the Koran and the sayings of holy men, executed in elegant Arabic characters, after the manner of a tesselated pavement. Apart from the decaying hovels around, the sepulchre itself would form a magnificent picture; and even now, at the distance of a mile, its double dome and lofty minarets, entirely covered with beaten gold, cannot fail to excite the admiration of a lover of the picturesque. On the evening of Nao Roz, or the new year of the old Persian calendar, a day of rejoicing as well as of prayer, the scene is more animated than usual, prospect, the gilded minarets'alone from their great height are just tipped. Then individuals of every feature and race are met. The wanderer from far Thibet and Cashmere, the Affghan and the Persian, the Mogul and the native Arab, both horse and foot, proceed to take part in the festivities of the ensuing day. Others spread their carpets or their cloaks by the road-side, and kneeling in the attitude of prayer, perform their devotions with an energy that might be considered sincere, did we not know the character of the people. Turned towards the Kibla of their faith, their countenances exhibit every variety of feature, and perhaps, in no place of the same extent can be remarked so manv forms of the 'human face divine;' nor is the antithesis wanting, for in similar numbers of the species, wherever congregated, there would not be displayed, perhaps, so many of the bad propensities of our race.— [Jones.)187 KAF—KAK KAFAR—Lat. , Lo '?- , _ t , . ] r lcv ; 4 , , A village in Turkish Kurdistan, situated about two-thirds ot the way trora Snlimania to Altun Kopri.— [Rich.)

A district of Georgia, Asiatic Russia. It is bounded on the north by the crest of the main range of the Caucasus, east by the Alazan River, south by the district of Kartalinia, and the steppe of Upandor, and west by the River Arao-ua separating it from part of Ossetia. Its length is about 150 miles, audits breadth about 50 miles, and it has an area of 4,800 square miles Its divisions are Siknak and Telab. Kakhetia consists chiefly ot the valley ot the Alazan, and of a portion of that of the Gori, from which the ' rs t divided by a spur of the Caucasus which terminates at their junction, ihe mountain system of the district is formed by the village spurs oi the Caucasus, which run down to the Alazan, and by the spur above-mentioned. 1 he only river of the district is the Alazan, but the Gori bounds its south portion and the Aragua its western. Mineral springs are found in the mountains ot this district. The population of Kakhetia, according to Chesney, is as follows in Siknak, 56 villages, containing 7,216 houses, inhabited by 49,^o4 Georgians 3,968 Armenians and 1,106 Tartars, and Jelal, 101 villages containing 7,944 houses, inhabited by 47,762 Georgians, 4,283 Armenians, 238 ^ urtemburgers, and 1,388 Tartars, total of the two divisions 108,009. ^ an Haxthausen, however, savs there are only 115 villages with 14,253 houses, viz., m the town of Jelal 472, of Siknak 623, and in villages 13,158. ^ Ihe villages of Kakhetia vary in size, some of the small ones containing 20 houses and others as many as 400. Of the rateable farms 7,122 belong to the Crown peasants, 3,230 to the church peasants, and 3,901 to the peasants of the nobles In those parts where the vine is cultivated the farms generally he scattered among the the vineyards. Each village forms an mdependen pans , w nc i has its forests or more usually one shared in common with several communes. Every inhabitant is at liberty to cut and carry away as much wood as he pleases, but he can sell nothing, the consent of the community at large being required previous to any sale. To each farm are generally attache188 KAK from 15 to 20 desatinas of land, and to the villages in the vine districts from 5 to 40 desatinas of vineyard. The land is attached inseparably to the farms, and is not divided among* the heirs ; great family union prevails, the eldest male member, whether grandfather, father, brother, or uncle, has an uncontrolled power over the rest, and takes care of all; a family frequently comprises members of several generations and as many as thirty individuals; if any dispute arises the property is divided and allotted by chosen empires, A system of two courses of farming prevails here : maize is the chief produce, and then barley and wheat. Improvements in agriculture are occasionally attempted by the nobles. Kvery farm pays to the Crown a tax in wheat and barley, and there are old colonists in garden ground or vineyards, who pay a money tax on wine. It is evident that irrigation was formerly conducted on a system of careful supervision, but at present every noble uses the canals as he pleases. The peasants, however, are still subject to the control of the water bailiffs, every one having the use of the water in proportion to the amount of taxes he pays to the Crown. The peasants of the nobles and Princes pay a week tribute to their lord a seventh part of the produce of the land they hold under him, frequently, however, this is restricted to the seventh sheaf. Labourers here receive board and clothing and 30 roubles a year as wages. The peasants' houses in Kakhetia have usually a thatched roof of straw and rushes; the sides are either built up with masonry or planked between wooden posts, they occasionally consist of interwoven bushes plastered with clay. The dwelling generally only contains one large apart ment, in the middle of which is the fire, and on one side all the beds piled up in order: there is sometimes an arcade running all round the building, or along three sides. The Kakhetians are described as the handsomest and most warlike of the Georgians, but they are also said to be very turbulent and exceedingly litigious. They have always held their own against their warlike neighbours, the Lesgis, owing to the excellent organisation of their defensive svstem. They have also frequently rebelled against and given great trouble to the Russians. The climate of the plain portion of Kakhetia is warm in summer and mild in winter, but the elevated districts are exceedingly cold. Along the banks of the rivers fever of a malarious type is very prevalent. The soil is a mixture of clay, chalk, and black earth. The cultivated part has a length of 60 miles and a breadth of 20 miles, and this space is finely wooded and covered with gardens and vineyard, and is by far the richest and most beautiful part of Georgia. The produce consists of considerable quantities of madder, grain, silk, and cotton, and the greater part of Geor gia is supplied from its vines. Kinnier says the district is greatly in want of water, the village being often at such a distance from the springs that the natives are forced to alleviate their thirst by fruits or wine. There are many extensive and valuable forests on the slopes of the mountains in this district. The chief town is Telav. The religion of the Kakhetians is partially that of the orthodox Georgian church, and partially that of the Armenio-Georgian. As the hereditary estate of the Georgian Princes lay chiefly on the Kakhet district it has always been much favoured, and though at first it rebelled frequently, the izihabitauts long ago gave up hopes of successful resistance189 KAK—KAN to the Russians, and great numbers of the nobles have entered the army and have in many cases attained high rank, Prince Bragation, who was killed at Borodino, and a member of the old Royal Family of Georgia, being a notable instance. {Kinnier—Monteith—Chestiey—Van Haxthausen.) KALASAR.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Bayazld, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of the Murad So. It is beautifully watered and is inhabited by Persians from Erivan. [Stewart.) KALDANI— \ See Chaldeans. KALPIA—Lat. Long. Elev. A valley in Russian Armenia, which drains to tbe Aras on its right bank, about four miles below the junction of the ArpaChai. In it are situated some salt mines, which have for many ages supplied Georgia and even the Caucasus with that article. The salt is so abundant that the people have hitherto had no occasion to go to any depth. A range of hills bordering the valley on the east side is apparently entirely composed of that mineral, and in the sides of these numerous excavations have been made. Under the Persians these mines were farmed for £3,000 per annum and a village of 100 families was employed exclusively in working them.— [Monteith.) KALP SC.—Lat. ' Long. Elev.

Elev. A village in the Government of Georgia, two leagues from En van. It lies like an oasis in the desert surrounded by high barren plains, and at a little distance has more the appearance of a forest than a village; the houses and farm buildings being concealed among tall trees and underwood. 1 he streets are narrow and run between two walls. 1 he houses stand generally in walled farmyards, the doors and windows never opening on to the streets. At present it retains only a portion of its former prosperity; it once contained 1,300 farms, but has now only 72. On the acclivity of a hill above it a large brook takes its rise from 40 springs and branches out into small channels conveying the water in all directions. Horticulture is here an object of especial attention, the gardens at Kanakir are carefully irrigated and yield an extremely rich produce: agriculture is comparatively neglected, wheat, barley, flax, and a peculiar kind of rye are grown here, [ f an Haxthausen.)

A province of the Russian Government of Georgia which lies between the rivers Aras and Kur, and chiefly occupies the western portion of the angle formed by their confluence. At the widest place between Nakhshvan and Elizabethpol it is about 120 miles broad, and it extends nearly as far westward as the meeting of the two rivers ] it has an area of about o,250 square miles. With the exceptions of a narrow valley and a richly culti vated plain, which extends from the right side of the Kur to the estuary of the Karachai, the province is hilly, or rather mountainous, being traversed in different directions by branches from the Sarial Dagh itself on a spur of range which originally comes from Mount Ararat. The spurs of this moun tain spray out in directions from south-west to south-east, all of which are ended by the Aras River. Some of the peaks attain a considerable height as Dalydagh 11,690, Tutchtikan 11,800, and the Kapnlchidagh 12,840. Besides two of inconsiderable size, Karabagh contains the lakes of Khano- gOl and Kara-gol; and in addition to the Aras and Kur, the interior is watered by the Karghar, the Tartar, the Intcha-chai, the Kara-chai, the BazSr-chai, and some twenty other considerable streams. In some places the soil is clayey or sandy, but the rest is a rich black loam; and except in some of the low parts bordering the rivers, the climate is cool and healthy at all seasons of the year. The mineral productions are naphtha, copper, emery, and salt. Shiel says the district of Karabagh contains mines where copper and iron are procur able to an extent almost unlimited. The iron ore is in some places so pure that the mountains are said to be formed of that substance. The animal productions consist of horses of a very fine breed, buffaloes and camels; and of tigers, panthers, bears, wolves, boars and jackals, and abundance of forest game, such as bears, elks, panthers, wolves, foxes, and jackals. These caused the woods in this district to be the favourite hunting-ground of the late Prince Royal of Persia when it was under that Kingdom. The rich pasture grounds are intermixed with vines, fruit-gardens, and fields of tobacco, silk, flax, wheat, maize, millet, and cotton; and most of the other parts of the district are covered with those fine forests of oak, plane, poplar, cypress, elm, ash, birch, fir, beech, and walnut trees, from which the Tartar appella tion black garden was derived. Though the fisheries of the Araxes and Kur are good, the flocks numer ous, and the vegetable productions abundant, Karabagh being without manufactures, it has no commerce, unless the local interchange and sale of191 KAR commodities may be so-called. The villages are very inferior, and the houses, besides being badly constructed, are dark and usually filled with smoke. The inhabitants of the province consist of Tartars, Armenians, Kurds, and Boscha (gipsies) numbering in all 98,614 souls; of whom 25,187 are Tartars. Here, as in Daghistan, the Tartar and Armenian languages pre vails ; but the Nestorians use a particular dialect, and the Kurds another, called Kourilien, which is a compound of Tartar and Turkish. Syriac is also in use. The religions are the Mahamadan and the Christian: of the former besides the Shias and Sunls, there is a third sect, called the All llahia; and of the latter the followers belong to the Armenian and Nestorian (locally called Nasran) churches. The people consist of nobles, begs, and agas; priests, the mass (indivi duals who, for services have been exempt for a certain period from taxation) and peasants or townspeople. Abandoned for the most part to listless idleness, the inhabitants only differ from other northerns by their black hair, and tall, handsome figure. The Kurdish nomades are fierce, courageous, and inclined to drunkenness. The Tartars and Armenians on the contrary are sober, but not particularly courageous, the former are inclined to theft, the latter to trickery and impos ture ; and both are so economical as to be often clad in tatters. Polygamy is permitted, but it is rare that any Musalman has a second wife. The Tar tar women cover their faces with great care, and are considered to be chaste, which is not the case with the Armenian ladies. The local Government was patriarchal, but it is now administered by a military superintendent assisted by a native. Some of the Nestorians, who live apart in the mountainous country which separates Turkey from Persia, say that their ancestors were Greeks. The different tribes of Kurds appear to be the descendants of the Parthians who were dispersed over Assyria and Mesopotamia ; and a dialect of the Syriac is still preserved amongst the wanderers. The name is derived from kerad (to speak). Under the ancient name of Raine, Karabagh formed a part of the Armenian kingdom; and previously to its entire destruction by Timurlang, the capital, Barda, was distinguished for its great size and its numerous inhabitants, the descendants of the oldest Armenians. The Persian dominion succeeded, and that of the Turks followed. This continued till the country was recovered by Nsdar Shah. In 1809 it came under the government of Native Khans, and it so remained till, in 1822, it became subject to Russia. This was considered by the Persians their choicest province, and it is that whose loss they most regret. On assuming the Government of the Province, the Russians made an exact survey of it which is an interesting historical and statistical account of the country. The following particulars are selected from it. The Tartars of Karabagh form a motley and mixed population; the former mostly leading a nomadic life, and roving about in the summer after they have cultivated their fields sufficiently to yield the bare necessary produce. They wander in the mountains, which are rich in wood and pasture, and during the hot months journey as far as the confines of the snowy regions, among the dwellings of the predatory Kurdish Tartars. In the autumn they return for the harvest to the plains, which in the rainy season yield excellent pasture for their flocks. They are a wealthy and hos-192 KAR pitable race : single Tartars possess thousands of sheep^ hundreds of buffaloes, and large numbers of horses of the finest breeds. The mountaineers are comparatively poor; but amidst the mountains of Karabagh is an elevated table-land, where the winter corn, peculiar to colder climates, is cultivated; whilst in the hot plains of the Kur and Aras rice and cotton flourish greatly, and the deeper valleys, from their southern climate, are richly clothed with vineyards. The whole burden of taxation falls upon the farmers, their villages or com munes, and appears to be regulated by the produce of the soil and the demands of the landowners. The mode of levying the taxes is very compli cated, and differs in almost all the villages: they are mostly paid in kind. The Khans had formerly large territorial possessions, the revenue derived from which contributed to meet the wants of the State in addition to the direct taxes. The country is divided into twenty-two circles. Each village forms a community, which has a Keyika, or elder, over it, together with a body of decemvirs (Tschansch), generally one or two surgeons, and a priest or mula. These officers are exempt from the payment of taxes, as are also the farms of widows and the poorer classes, various persons in the service of the Khan, inspectors of the water-works, &amp;c. The principal taxes are a fixed money payment to the State, and a variety of contributions toward the household expenses of the Khan, such as the supply of fodder for his horses and cattle, butter, wood, sheep, and oxen, and sometimes also a payment in money. r l he Soljan is a tax paid in wheat;. the Maldschagat is one consisting of a fifth of all crops of corn, cotton and rice, &amp;c. There are other imposts, w hich are rendered variously in money, produce, and service, such as furnishing the post service with horses, ploughing and harvesting the lands of the Khan, &amp;c. These duties are always levied with reference to the character of the population: the nomadic communes generally pay in cattle rather than corn. The smaller charges on produce are frequently commuted into a money payment. A tax is laid on marriages, in some parts amounting to ten roubles. There are communities of Ketschpars, a class who pay a few taxes from the produce of their ground, perform various services, such as cultivating the melon-gardens, &amp;c., and receive in return a certain portion of the produce of the land. In the harvest time they claim, besides their food, three sheaves out of every twenty. The field implements and working cattle are the property of the lord of the soil. The communes, in renting their lands to strangers, bargain to receive one-tenth of the produce. In the communities under private proprietors, the services rendered are of different kinds, the latter having to pay nearly all their dues to the landowner in natura, as cloth for garments, salt, sacks, woollen stuffs for pack-saddles, carpets, worsted, &amp;c.

A village in Russian Armenia, about 50 miles east of Erivan, on right bank of the Aras. It is generally supposed to be the site of Armavera. On three sides the perpendicular cliffs of a ravine and the Aras rendered walls unne cessary ; the west side was defended by a strong and lofty wall of well-built masonry. The works enclose a space of two miles in circumference but are narrow, and only contain one large building on the west front, where the ravine joins the Aras; here are the ruins of a bridge over the Aras. Ouseley describes it as an extraordinary edifice, standing boldly on the edge of steep and lofty rocks, immediately over a rapid and winding branch of that river com manding fine views along its noble stream. The walls of stone work exceed five feet in thickness. It is now an inconsiderable village. [Monteith—Ouseley) KARA KAYA.—Lat. Long. ' Elev.

It is most romantically situated in a deep dale formed by the bases of high hills, which covered to their very summit entrench it on every side. The Pambeki River, that runs close by it, enlivens the whole of its landscape. It is the chief place in the dis trict of Pambek, and used to be the chief military post of the Russians on this frontier, and had a g-arrison of 2,000 men, with artillery in proportion. The town is unprotected by walls, but the Russians have constructed a fortress of palisades, in which they have about 20 g-uns. The houses are built underground, those of the officers being constructed of wood.— [Morier.) KARA KILlSA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A villag-e in the Province of Bayazid, Asiatic Turkey, on the road between that place and Arzrum, from which it is HO on east. Eraser describes it as ' a collection of grass and dung- heaps/' It is so called from a ruined church near it, which is built of a dark-colored stone. It contains about 35 Armenian families, and some of Shia Mahamadans from Erivan. It is not far distant from the Murad Su. It is encircled by a belt of green herbs called ' Shadami,' which produce a sort of pulse. A great many horses are bred in this neighbourhood; they herd with the cows and buffaloes during the day, and are driven with them into the village at sunset. {Brant— Stuart— Fraser.) KARA KOLAK.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of ArzrtJm, Asiatic Turkey, 75 miles west of that place, consisting of about 50 underground houses inhabited by Mahamadan families.

They are of Turkman descent, from one Kara \ usaf, and are called Kara Koinifl, or the black sheep from their carrying a figure of that animal on their banner. Their chief place was Van, but they were dispersed by Timurlang. Morier mentions having met with them between Abbassabad, and Nakhshwan, and Ainsworth near Angora in Anatolia. {Malcolm—Morier.)

The road from the village of Jevizlik is broad and safe through thick woods of fine trees, amongst which are rhododendron and sycamore. From the top of the pass, 7,000 feet in elevation, there is a beautiful view of the Black Sea. The descent on the south side appears to be more toilsome and difficult. There are two roads over this range, one used in the summer, and one for the winter. {Stuart—- Shiel.)195 KAR KARA SO—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the range of Nimrud Tagh, and falls into the Murad Chai branch of the Euphrates, a few miles below Kiravi. At about two hours from^the Murad, the Kara Su is fordable near an old bridge, the water being about two feet deep, and the breath of the stream about 25 yards. This must be the river which Viscount Pol- lington crossed on his journey from Arzrum to Mush about two hours after he crossed the Murad Chai; he mentions having to go considerably to the East (of the road) to reach a ford, which when found was deep enough to cause him some trouble. Taylor who visited the source of this river three and a half hours east from Mush, describes it as welling out of a large circular hole of volcanic origin, having a circumference of 100 feet and situated in the middle of the plain. The effect he adds of the water perpetually overflowing this crater without the slightest effort or bubble of any kind was very remarkable, as it seemed hardly possible that the numer ous branching streams that it supplied could owe their origin to this unruffled and apparently motionless reservoir.— [Brant—Pollington—Taylor?)

KARKXK—Lat. Long. 44 0 27 / . Elev. A town, the capital of the Shahrizor, district of Kurdistan, 140 miles on the road from Baghdad to Musal, from which it is 145 miles. There is a lower and an upper town, the latter of which is situated on a com manding eminence, nearly perpendicular on all sides, about 150 feet high, and walled. Below it is an extensive suburb scattered over the plain. It is the largest town in Lower Kurdistan, and has an air of some importance, but the streets are irregular and narrow, filthy and ill constructed, and the houses generally are excessively mean, though there are a few shady and pleasant fruit gardens. The population is estimated by Kinnier at 18,000 souls, Turks, Armenians, Nestorians, and Kurds, but Goldsmidt thinks it does not now number more than 7,000 souls. The city is defended by mud walls, and has two gates, seven mosques, 14 coffee-houses, one bath, one caravanserai, three convents, and three Catholic churches. The country around the town is uneven, and rocky mountains separate the district of Karkiik from the fine plain of Altun Koprl. This pass is several miles in length, and nearly about the middle of it are ai number of naptha pits, which yield an inexhaustible supply of that commodity. Many of the pits are in the bed of a small stream, which forces a passage through the rocks, they emit a very disagreeable smell, are about three feet in diameter, and some of them eight or ten feet in depth. The naptha is here in a liquid state and perfectly black; it is conveyed from the bottom to the top in leathern buckets, then put into earthen jars and sent all over the neighbouring coun try. Karkuk is the mart to which all the productions of this part of Kur distan are carried not by the Kurds themselves, but the natives of Karkuk, who go for the purpose and make advances of money to the cultivators for their rice and honey. There is continual intercourse between Sulimania and Karknk, the articles exported from the latter are boots, shoes, and some coarse cotton cloth, the returns for which are pulse, honey, gallnuts, sumach, fruits, rice, ghee, cotton, sheep, and cattle.

A Pashalic of Asiatic Turkey, bounded north by Akhalzik, east by Russian Armenia, south by the Province of Bayazid and Arzrnm, and west by Arz-197 KAR rflra. It forms part of the Armenian plateau, and is surrounded by lofty mountains, some of which are covered with perpetual snow, and has a severe climate. Its soil is stony and sterile in the mountains, but rich in the valleys. It is watered by the Aras, and several of its tributaries, as the Karschai and Arpachai. Cattle and silk-worm rearing- form the chief occupation of the inhabitants, who are Turks, Armenians, and Kurds. The fertile plains of this Pashalic produce abundant crops of wfieat and various grams, the surplus of which is exported to Georgia. Wheat produces six to eight-fold, and barley eight to ten. There is also some excellent pasture land on which herds of remarkably fine and large cattle graze. The Government of Kars, however, also include the district of Akhltskhai, and then together represent Childir or Turkish Georgia. r Ihe length of this tract is about 9U miles, and the breadth 40, or about 2,300 square miles. KARS—Lat. 40° 37' I' Long. 43° 9' ^ Elev. 6,000. A town in the Province of same name, Asiatic Turkey, and 90 miles north east of Arzrum. It is situated in an elevated plain on the left bank of the Kars Chai, and is built on and about a most picturesque rock in an ampi- theatre of black basaltic hills. The houses are all built of black basalt, and this circumstance, combined with the total want of trees, gives the town a dismal appearance. It stands on both sides of the river, which encircles the walled portion of the town on three sides, and the two portions are connected by substantial stone bridges. On the east side is the Armenian suburb built on a gentle elevation, and nearer the river rises a lofty hill crowned with the citadel. The upper fortress is divided into two parts, the highest serving as a citadel, where the Turkish garrison usually reside, the lower part principally occupied by the inhabitants ; the whole is enclosed by a wall of stone built on the slope of a hill, but the nature of the ground does not allow of a ditch or glacis. It is commanded from without by some hills within short cannon range, and from the circumstances of the walls being built on a steep descent the interior of many parts of the fortress are seen from the outside. The two suburbs, Ousta Kassi and BairSm Pasha, are within a short distance of the walls, and are principally inhabited by Armenians, Kurds, and Jews: these are only defended by a wall of loose stones and are incapable of further defence. The population of Kars before the siege by the Russians in 1828 is estimated at 12,000, but now it is little better than a heap of ruins not containing above 1,500 or 2,000 families. A great part of the Turkish population abandoned it during the Russian occupation, and all the Armenians emigrated with the retreating army of the Russians. The Turks of Kars have always been considered a turbulent and bad race of people. The fortress of Kars is of great antiquity, and was celebrated in the time of the Armenian Kings, but it has been greatly enlarged by the Turks. Before the use of artillery it was considered a place of great strength, and ventured to stand a siege by Timor by whom it was taken, though it was more fortunate when besieged by Nadir Shah. It was also besieged by Prince Paskiwitch in 182H, of which the following account is taken from Monteith^s kars and Arzrlim. ' That able General determined to occupy Kuchik Koi, for which purpose he was obliged to march nearly round the fortress, a dangerous movement, both from the presence of the Turkish army, and from the number of ravines, now filled with water from recent rains, which the troops would have to pass.198 KAR They bad, liowever, less difficulty to encounter than had been anticipated; for they hardly met with any resistance from the Turkish army, which merely defended the village of Azakchai for a few minutes, and then retreated beyond the Kars River. ' The Turks having neglected to occupy a range of hills which extend to the suburb of Ousta Kassi, Cfeneral Paskiewitch ordered it to be fortified, and placed there six battalions of infantry, two regiments of Cossacks, and six pieces of artillery. This may be considered as the first parallel, extending on both sides of the ravine of the Pashkoe Chai from which the batteries com manded and took in reverse the works attacked. Four batteries were con structed, whose fire was principally directed against an entrenched camp, which the Turks still occupied outside the town as well as the great burying- ground beyond the river. The first notice the Turks had of the existence of these batteries was their opening fire on the morning of the 28rd of June. They soon recovered from their surprise, however, and returned the fire with vigour; but they were dislodged at the same time from the burying-ground and the rocks behind it; and though they made strenuous efforts to recover the buvying-ground, and for the moment succeeded, they were at last forced to retreat, and the Russians were able to establish themselves permanently there. The Turkish entrenched camp occupied the ground which was intended for the second parallel, but after an obstinate conflict they were driven entirely beyond the Kars Chai; they were equally unsuccessful in their attempt to defend the suburb opposite the castle, and the Russians lodged themselves in the buildings, which the Pasha had neglected to destroy. ' The second parallel was now completed; a battery of four pieces of heavy artillery was established in the Palace of Timiir Pasha, which Colonel Bourtsoff had made himself master of; another, of six pieces, was placed on the height occupied by the Turkish entrenched camp, and a third on the height occupied by Colonel Borodine. These batteries swept three sides of the fortress, and soon silenced the Turkish artillery, spreading terror among the inhabitants, who began to seek shelter in the ravines of the Kara Dagh. The bastions and ramparts of the suburb of Ousta Tapa beginning to fall, Prince Paskiwitch instantly ordered a breaching battery to be established on the walls of the suburb, from which the Turks were entirely driven; and General Mouravieff succeeded in occupying the Kara Dagh and the battery which defended it. Colonel Borodine, with his brigade and the 8Uth and 40th Chasseurs, then crossed the river, and occupied the other suburb; so that the Russians were soon masters of all the ground to the very foot of the citadel, where the inhabitants in the wildest disorder were endeavouring to seek shelter. The walls were rapidly falling before the fire of the Russian artillery, and that of the enemy was silenced; the bravest and most active of the Russians had established themselves on the terraces of the houses and kept up an incessant fire on the walls of the citadel; the gates were soon forced, and the nearest towers, with 25 pieces of the artillery, were in the hands of the besiegers. The Turks made a greater resistance on the western side, but with little success; for the whole of the lower fortress was soon occupied, and the Pasha gave up all hopes of a longer resistance. A white flag was now hoisted; Prince Paskiewitch demanded the surrender of the Pasha and of the Turkish garrison as prisoners of war, and the disarming of the militia and local troops, who were to be permitted to return to their199 KAR homes. So great was the panic that 1,000 Delis, stationed in the heart o£ the town, passed before the llussian troops without venturing to commit any act of hostility. Imam Pasha hesitated to accept these terms, trusting to be relieved, and demanded two days to consider declaring his determination to bury himself under the ruins of the part of the citadel he still occupied. The principal Mulas brought this answer to the General, who replied, ' I will give you two hours to make up your minds. Mercy, if you surrender; death, if you resist/' As this threat was supported by 40 pieces of artillery ready to open on the confined space of the upper citadel, the garrison began to show signs of insubordination, and Imam Pasha, fearing an insurrection, in despair brought the keys of the place, and gave himself up a prisoner. The garrison surrendered at 10 a. m ., and the Russian flag was hoisted on the ramparts. Twenty-two mortars and 129 cannon, with a considerable quantity of gunpowder and other ammunition, were found in the place, besides 6,000 sacks of grain in the magazine. The loss of the Russians amounted to 13 Officers and 400 men killed and wounded; that of the Turks to 2,000 killed and wounded, besides 1,861 prisoners. The whole garrison, including the militia, had originally amounted to 11,000 men, but 8,000 had either retired or had been disarmed before the surrender of the fortress. In the Russian war of 1854-55 they again captured Kars.— (Monteith.) KARTALINIA—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of the Russian Government of Georgia, which extends from Kakhetia to Immeretia and the provinces of the Akhltskhai; and northward, from the Bortchalin and Tiflis district to the territories of Gora and Ossestia. It contains two districts, Duchet on the eastern side, and Goria towards the west; it has a superficies of about 2,600 square miles, and was once a separate kingdom, of which the ruined city, Mtskhetha, ten miles north of Tiflis, was the capital. Kartalinia is mountainous, having towards the north an elevated limestone chain, running parallel to the Caucasus, and gradually diminishing in height towards the Kur, where there is an extensive plain. There is also a considerable plain towards the east in Gori. On the western side there are three large rivers, the Ksan and the Araghva, first and second with numerous tributaries; there are also the Narckvavi, the Arghoun, the Medjouda, and several others. And towards the eastern side are the Kur, audits affluents, the Liaja, the Medjouda, the Lekhowea, and the Ksan. The soil is not equal to that of the other provinces, yet it is very productive. Much of the surface is covered with oak, walnut, and other fine timber of various kinds; and in other parts, hemp, madder, tobacco, and grains are cultivated with success. On the borders of the eastern provinces is Duchet, a fortified place, and the chief town of the district. Until recently the Kingdoms of Kakhetia and Kartalinia composed Georgia Proper; but according to the ukase of 1831, the latter now includes all the territory which is bounded by Immeretia, the Caucasus, and the Armenian and Mussulman Provinces. Its extent is about 95 miles from the borders of Erlvan to the Caucasus in the Lezgi country, and about 175 miles westward from the borders of Sheki to those of Kars: it contains nearly 16,743 square miles of surface.— [Chesney.)

It seems to be formed from hot springs and bituminous fountains.—(CA^ney.) KEBAN MADEN.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, near the left bank of the Euphrates, about 12 miles below the junction of the east and west branches of that river, 30 miles west-north-west of Kharpat, 80 miles north-north-west of Diarbakr. It is situated in a ravine through which a small stream runs to join the Euphrates. There is a silver mine near this to which the town evidently owes its existence, for there would appear to be no other possible inducement to have fixed it in such a situation. The mountains around exhibit barrenness under its most forbidding aspect, for they produce neither tree nor shrub, nor vegetation of any kind. The ravine is so narrow that there is no space for cultivation, as the mountains unite in it at an acute angle. The climate is extremely hot in the summer, and from the elevation of the mountains a good deal of snow falls in the winter. The town contains about 400 or 500 families, all more orKEB—KEL less employed in the working- and superintending the mine, or in supplying the wants of the miners and their families. The greater number are Greeks, natives of the mountains between Gumish Khana and Tarabizun, but there are likewise some Armenians and Turks. The latter are generally the direc tors of the various departments, the Armenians are the artizans, and the Greeks are the miners. There is no trade in the place excepting for the consumption of the inhabitants. The mine is of argentiferous lead and would appear to be a very unprofitable concern, at least in the hands of the Government. [Brant.) KEFFR JOZE—Lat. Long. Elev.

Elev. A pass over the Kurdistan mountains leading from the plains of Azarbijan to the Rowandiz district of Kurdistan on the only line of communication between these places. The ascent commences from the village of Sinkar on the north side, and, crossing a spur of the main range, comes to another with glaciers the slope of which is considerable. The passage of these is attended with some difficulty. Thence the ascent continues through vast piles of snow accumulated by the drift winds to a depth of many hundred feet and only broken through by bold and sharp rocky pinnacles of grey and green quartz or broken off abruptly over dark precipices of brown and blue schists shivering away in silvery leaflets and shaking in the breeze more like fragments of the ice heap than of the mountain. There is then a descent into a ravine usually filled with snow, then another steep and rocky ascent to a precipice formed by a vast dyke of siennites which crossed the whole crest and constitutes the summit of the peak of Rowanduz or Sheikhiwn as it is called by the Kurds. From the summit a view is obtained of almost all north Kurdistan, the elevation being 10,568 feet. There is then a steep descent over snow to a halting place at an elevation of 8,568 feet. From this the road keeps rounding the declivities of the mountain, which presents diallage rocks, talc schists, red and brown schists, and conglomerates to a smaller rivulet coming from a small lake at the south-west side of the mountain. It then passes a torrent 12 feet by 2 in depth, a little further one of 11 feet by 1^, and then another 14 feet by 1^. It then continues to descend rapidly till the region of oak and jasmine is reached, and in five 201 1B202 KEL—KER hours from the above halting' place the village of Jaffuli is reached 3,742 feet in elevation. This is in summer one of the most frequented passes, but in winter it is impassable. It is much exposed to violent and deadly drifts of snow which come on so suddenly and with such terrific fury thnt a tra veller who is once fairly caught in them rarely escapes. From the frequency of these accidents an extraordinary degree of dread and mystery is attached to this pass, and in the superstition of the Kurds this feeling connects itself with the talisman of the Keli Shin which is supposed to have be&lt;n created by some potent magician to afford the means of protection against danger, but which, its use being now unknown, only serves to lure fresh victims to destruction. The Deli Shin is a pillar of dark blue stone 6 feet in height, 2 in breadth, and 1 in depth, rounded off at the top and at the angles and let into a pediment, consisting of one solid block of the same sort of stone, 5 feet square and 'Z deep.

J errier says it is a small place of 1,000 houses, the entrance to it is by a paved street which crosses the town and terminates at a fine bridge of burnt bricks of nine arches, leading to the suburb situated on the right bank of the Diala where there is a splendid caravanserai. The caravanserai Shah at Khanakin is in the centre of a square surrounded by low booths which form the bazaar. Here are always to be found crowds of the pillaging population in the neighbourhood, both Arabs and Kfirds, the Jalfclbows, the Sinjavl, the205 KHA Bilber finds himself by the side o£ the Bakhtiari and the Lur. {Kinneir— RawLinson—Taylor—Jones—Ferrier.) KHANAKIR.—Lat. Lonj?. Elev. A village in the Erivan district of Georgia, situated about seven miles from ErivSn? At a little distance it has more the appearance of a thick forest than a village, the houses and farm buildings being almost concealed among tall trees and underwood. It is surrounded by high barren plains and wild and waste hills. The streets are narrow and run between two walls. The houses stand generally in-walled in farm yards, the doors and windows never open ing on to the streets. Formerly this village is said to have contained 1,300 farms, now it has only VZ.

Elev. 4,83^ A town in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic r lurkey, 90 miles north-west of Diarbakr. It is placed on the summit of an eminence not far from 1,000 feet in elevation at the termination of a range of mountains the higher parts of which command it, so that it cannot be regarded as a strong military position. The city overlooks an extensive, beautiful, and productive plain, and is said to contain 1,720 families, of which 1,400 are Turkish, 300 Armenian, and 20 Catholic. The plain furnishes a vast quantity of grain ; its length may be estimated at not less than 36 miles, in general it is not abo\e four to six miles broad, but in some parts it expands more; it is of unequal fertility, the centre being well watered by numerous streams, is most productive, while near the foot of the mountains on the sloping edges of the plain the land is arid and stony. Wheat returns twelve to sixteenfold. Ihe climate is temperate, being neither excessively warm in summer nor extremely cold in winter, the productions of the soil are various, consisting of eveiy §r iain ^ grapes, wine of a superior quality, oil from seeds and cotton. Ihe streams of the plain flow east till they fall into the Murad C hai which, skirting the east extremity of the plain, joins the Kara hu two hours above the ferry of Keban Maden. The plain of Kharput is perhaps one of the best culti vated and most prosperous in all Turkey. Colonel Goldsmid says the view of the Kharpiit plains coming up from the Deva Boyun mountain to the southward is magnificent. Some idea of the extent of low country may be formed from the statement that the Murad Chai, one of the largest rivers of Asia Minor, appears like a minor canal or stream in the midst of the plain through which it winds. Colonel Gold-206 KHA—KHE smid also thinks that Mr. Brant's estimate of 1,720 families as the popula tion of Kharpnt cannot include the village of Magra, three miles distant. This resembles an Indian cantonment rather than a common Asiatic Turkish town. Besides the Pasha's residence it contains the Telegraph Office and Barracks for the troops. Americans form the bulk of the Christian popuLtion. Schools have been opened by these, who have also a chapel for the Protestant congregation. [Kinneir—Brant—Goldsmid.) KHAKZAN CHAI.—Lat. Long. Elev.

A wall now in ruins crosses the neck of the peninsula and once protecte e entrance to the castle: the wall right and left of the castle entrance extends along the edge of the ravine and afterwards crosses it at each end of the town, uniting with two outworks or towers in the opposite side. These works as well as the castle have been long going to decay, ihe Bey resides in the castle. There is no trade here except for the supply of the most ordinary wants of the peasantry. 1 he bazaar contains a ou stalls in which nothing is to be seen but Aleppo handkerchiefs used as turbans, the inhabitants' boots and shoes from Arzrum, cotton cloth ot country manufacture, tobacco, pipe bowls, and a few other common neces saries with fruit and vegetables. The ordinary and legitimate revenue of the Bey is derived from a tenth of the produce of the soil which yields him about £150 per annum. In lieu of ' Saliyaneh' the people are bound to entertain strangers, and this being a post station the guests are numerous, and the tax not a light one. t i a The soil is not private property and is never bought or sold. Any one mav build on any unoccupied ground without a rent being demanded, or he may cultivate any vacant land by paying a tenth of the produce to the Bey. Any one who neglects to cultivate his fields risks losing them s 'O u l there be an applicant for them, but this never happens, as there is more land than hands to till it. The winter is here long and severe, and the summer hot, succeeding rapidly to the melting of the snow. (U/ant o mg on Glascot—Dickson.) KH1YAT-AL-SOK.—Lat. Long. Llev.

The two former have an old feud between them, which keeps them constantly at war with each other, to the great advan tage of the Bebbeh Pasha, who can only maintain his influence among them by dexterously availing himself of their internal dissensions, just as the Turks and Persians maintain their influence over him. A small stream separates these tribes; and they have one common mosque, in which they assemble on a Friday, and afterwards frequently retire to their respective sides of the rivulet and commence firing on each other. In their dress they resemble the Kurds of Amadia; but their language partakes both of the Bebbeh and Bahdianan dialects. The same remark holds good of the Rewandiz Kurds. There are none of the peasant races either in Khoshnav or Rowandiz.KHO—KHU The people of Klioshnav and Rowandiz are to the last degree savage and stupid. They have no sort of scruple about killing a man, but would not miss a prayer for the world, though they have been known to fight in the mosque. Many years ago there Avas a quarrel between two districts about a dog, in which 70 men were killed on the spot, of whom 30 fell in a mosque, after they had joined together in public worship. They still fight at intervals about this same quarrel; and no encounter takes place without the slaughter of some men. [Rich.) KHOSKHEYR.—Lat. Long. Elcv.

His son, Shekh Ali Khan, continued to hold it till 1811 when, having attempted to form a general confederacy of Daghistan and other Mahamadan States against Russia, he was attacked and driven out by the Russian General Marquis Palucci, since when it has been incorporated with Russia. {Imperial Gazetteer—Monteith—Chesney) KUBAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Caucasia which rises in Circassia, nearly 14,000 feet above the level of the Black Sea at the foot of Mount Elburz, the loftiest peak of215 KUB—KUR the Caucasus. It flows first north, then north-west, and ultimately due west, forming- the boundary, for above 300 miles, between Circassia and Russia. It then passes Ekaterinodar, and traversing a level steppe presenting to the eye only an interminable plain of reeds falls into the Black Sea, in the Bay of Kuban. This river can scarcely be said navigable. The water at its mouth is so shallow as to admit only the smallest vessels. All the tributaries of the Kuban flow like itself from the Caucasus mountains, joining it on the left bank : the principal are the Zelentchuk, Urup, and the united streams of the Laba and -Lman bu. Its total course is about 400 miles.— [Iiuperial Gazetteer 1) KOFA—Lat. Long. Elev. A ruined city of Asiatic Turkey, 88 miles south of Baghdad, on an affluent of the Euphrates. It was founded by the Kaliph Omar, became large, popu lous, and flourishing, and was the residence of the Kaliphs till Almanzor removed it to Baghdad about A.D. 760. Its decay and final ruin date from this period. All was assassinated at Kufa, and the ancient Arabic character, called Cufic, takes its name from it.— [Imperial Gazetteer.) KtJLAH—Lat. Long. Eler. A village in the Guriel district, of the Province of Tarabizun, Asiatic Turkey, situated at the junction of the Kulah and Ako, forming the Ajara Su, 60 miles east of Batum. It is a hereditary possession of the Pasha of Kars and is the principal place in the valley, containing with its immediate neighbour hood about 60 house?, and a bazaar with 30 shops. The climate is good, and grapes ripen readily, and wine is made. The forests in the Kulah valley are quite Alpine in their character, consist ing of small oak mixed with Scotch and spruce fir. [Brant.) KULAL1— Lat. Long. Elev. An island in the Caspian Sea on the east shore, near the mouth of the Manghkishlak Bay. [Abbott.) KUR—Lat. 40° 40' Long. 43° 25' Elev. A river of Georgia, Russia, which rises from the side of the Saghanlu mountain, in the Pashalic of Akhaltskhai, only a few miles north of the source of the Aras. The course which it first takes is a little east of north; in this direction it flows through the district of Akhaltskhai and almost to the town of that name, being augmented by numerous tributaries \v Inch entci it on both sides. Near the town of Akhaltskhai the river takes for about 70 miles a north east direction (at Gori it is fordable), when it runs east-south-east an addi tional distance of 50 miles to Mitzkheta, where it is joined by the Aragua, a large tributary coming in a south-south-east direction from the Caucasus. He-re there is a bridge said to have been built by Pompey. Ten miles below the function the main trunk passes through the city of Tiflis, where its ordinary width is 93 yards, which, in the season of floods, is augmented to 1233 yards, and at the latter period it has a depth of 27 feet. Here the river bears the name of Mtwari, and abounds with salmon and other lish . but its waters require to be filtered previously to being diunk. x\t Karaklissia, below Tiflis, it is joined in the right bank by the Pambeki River. Below Tiflis its course is south-east for a distance of 115 miles through the province of Georgia, in which it is increased by the ri\('is IMaitkobv, Dygom, and Vera. Lastly, on arriving on the bordeis of Kaiabagh, it is joined by a great stream' formed by the Alazani and Gori Rivers, whose216 KUR courses from the slopes of the Caucasus are nearly south-east and almost parallel to the Aras, as far as their point of junction which takes place within two miles of the latter. The Ktir now pursues a south-east course for about 120 miles between Erivan and Shirvan, from the last of which it receives numerous streams running into it in a south direction from the same moun tains. The waters of the Kur and Aras at leng-th uniting form one river, which makes a bold sweep north, and again another south through the plain of Moghan, when, after having run a distance of about 110 miles measured along its windings, it falls into the Caspian Sea by three mouths being navigable for boats up to the point of junction. In the valley of the Kur there are many localities which ought to all appearance be perfectly healthy, while in fact the climate is really deadly. The Kur is said to be navigable for vessels drawing not more than five feet water as far up as its junction with the Alazan, but vessels of consider able burden would not find a sufficiency of water higher than the junction of the Aras. Pliny describes the Kur as navigable to a point five days' land journey from the highest navigable point of the Phasis, thus making only a five days' land journey from the Black Sea to the highest navigable point of the Amu Daria, but this estimate will not hold good for the present time when at least 16 days' journey over a mountainous country would be required to transport goods from the Kur to the Phasis. {Chesney—Monteith—Mianon ) KORDISTAN—Lat. 34° to SOW Long. 40° to 48° Elev. The country inhabited by Kiirds may be said to consist of the whole of both sides of the main range, which running out south from Mount Ararat divides Asiatic Turkey from Persia, from Bayazid to near Hamadan. This tract has a length of not less than 500 miles, by a breadth of about 150 miles in general, but in the north in the latitude of Van, its breadth is not under 300 miles. These limits comprise portions of the provinces of Bayazid, Arzriim, Mush, Van, Diarbakr, Musal, and Turkish Kurdistan, in Asiatic Turkey, and of Ardelan or Persian Kurdistan, Azarbijan, and Kirmanshah in Persia. All that is known of these districts 1 have endeavoured to give under their respective titles, and I will only here, for the present at least, endeavour to collect the scattered notices of the country and people in general under the above title; these, a^ will be seen, are extremely meagre and unsatisfactory and quite insufficient for the compilation of a connected account of the country. Rich gives the following list of the districts of the Sulimania Division of Kurdistan :— ' Daouda, commencing four hours from Kifri; Dillo, Zenganeh, Kuom, Zun, or Zend, so called from the people who inhabit the district; Sheikhan, Nura, and Tchemtchemal, Tchia Souz, i.e., the Green Mount, Kewatche- mala, Shuan, Tchubook Kalaa, Esker, Kalaa Sewka, Gird Khaber, Bazian. ' KarSdagh, which is bounded by Dillo and Zenganeh on the west and north; on the south it goes to the Diala. The pass of Banikhilan, on the Diala, is in Karadagh. Karadagh is a large Government, and is sub-divided into several districts, that in which Banikhilan is situated is called Dizziaieesh, in which is also Gewrakalaa, Warmawa, Sertchinar, in which is Salimania, Soordash. Mount Goodroon is in this district; Mergeh, Pizhder. Between Mergeh and Pizhder flows the river of Alton Kopri, whose source is at Lajan, four or five hours west of Suk Bolak,■HHHHHHHHi KUR Ghellala, Sliinek, Mawutt, Aalan, Siwell^ Seraon, Mirawa, bounded by Mawut, Siwell, and Aalan, Balukh, Gapairon, Sheherbazar, Berkeon, Serotchik, Kulambar, Ifallebjce, bounded by Khulambar, Juanroo, Warmawa, and Zehao, Shemiran, a mountainous and desert district on the other side the Diala, Ichowtan, written 1 chef tan j it adjoins Kizlji, K.izzeljee, Terratool, Kara Hassan, a district which sometimes belongs to Baghdad and some times to Kurdistan; it is bounded by Kerkuk. Leilan, Tchemtchemal, and Shuan.' Kurdistan has been named the Switzerland of the East, a name which as regards its physical conformation is perhaps a just one, for it is one unending succession of steep and rugged mountains and fertile valley. It presents to the view either progressive clusters of hills heaped as it were upon each other, or great table lands covered with flocks, and the tents of the nomads who in summer roam over them. The valleys, or more correctly speaking glens, are narrow strips at the feet of mountains. The mountain system of Kurdistan consists briefly of the great southern spur of Mount Ararat, which divides the drainage of the Tigris from that of Persia. Every mountain range or petty spur within its limits, can be traced to this origin. This range has a direction of north-north-west, and by north to south-south-east and by south, and it throws its spurs out to the west into Asiatic Turkey, and to the east into Persia. The first great spur which the range throws out to the west leaves it about Latitude 38 o 30' nearly due west of Khoi, in Azarbijan, and running first south-west to get clear of the lake of Van, it then turns west and under the names successively of the Susuz Dagh, Hetrash Mountains, Sar Sara, Khos- fKhalp Dagh, Darkash Dagh, goes round the sources of the Tigris and changing its direction to south it runs west of Diarbakr, and then, continues into Mesopotamia under the name of Karaja Dagh, but we have nothing to do with it beyond its second south bend in Longitude 3!J 0 .'iO / . In about Latitude 38°, Longitude 44°, and just where it takes to the west course, this spur throws out another to the south, and then south-west which traverses the country of the Hakari Kurds, and in about Latitude 37 o 30', Longitude 43° is itself split into two, one under the name of Jabl Judi, running west-north-west to the junction of the Sert River with the Tigris, the other going south-east divides the Khabur, and some minor tributaries of the Tigris from the great Zab River, and is ended by the junction of that river with the Tigris. The next offshoots from the parent range is that of the Jawar Dagh, which in Latitude 37 o 20 , , Longitude 44 o 30 / runs out from the Tura Jalu peak, but is soon stopped by the Great Zab River. Again, west of Suj Bolak, where the main range is termed the Kendilan range, a spur is thrown out to the south-west and divides the drainage of the Greater and Less Zab and the province of Rowandiz and Koi Sanjak till it dies away into the plains near Arbel. This is the range which Rich terms the Khalkalan range. The next spurs are all short and insignificant and end in the junction of the sources of the Lesser Zab River. South of this, in Latitude 35 c 20', Longitude 46 o 20 / , the range throws out from the peak of Azmir Tagh a spur which divides the drainage of the Lesser Zab from that of the Diala River. This is the range which is crossed 217 I d218 KUR Toy tliG pass of Darband to tliG west of Sulimama, and the (1\ ing' laniifi- cations of which interpose themselves between the Adigirs, Adhem, and Diala, and are known as the Hamrin hills. The last west spur of this range leaves the parent range, a few miles w est of Mount Elvand, and running to the south-west and north of Kirmanshah and Kirind is crossed on the Baghdad and Kirmanshah road by the iak-i-Cxinah Pass, whence, dividing the drainage of the Diala from that of the Keikha, it runs south to the frontier of Asiatic Turkey, when it splits into two forks, which run north-west to south-east parallel with the ligris under the name of the Kebir Koh. The east spurs of this range are all short and insignificant, running down into the Urumia Lake till the province of Ardelan is reached, when it throws out a spur from the latitude of the Garran Pass, which runs into Khemseh and connects the Elbtirz range with the system of Ivurdistan. Again, it throws a low spur to the east, which intervenes between Senna and Ilamadan, whence the range takes the name of the peak of Elvand, and is continued thiough The rivers which take their rise within the limits of Kurdistan are very numerous and important, those on the west commencing from the noith being the west branch of the ligris, T5atman Su, Yezdikhaneh Su, Bitlis Chai, Sert Chai, Khabur, the Greater Zab, the Lesser Zab, the Diala, and the Kerkha. On the east the rivers are all small mountain torrents, the only one of any importance being the Jagatti. The only lake that I have heard of in Kurdistan is the Lake of Van, unless the Lake of Goljik, near Kharput, may be said to be in Kuidistan. The climate of Kurdistan varies with the elevation of its various parts; in the districts verging on the plains of ^lesopotamia it is extremely sultiy in summer, but mild and pleasant in winter, and in the higher regions near the crest of the main range the winter is extremely inclement, snow lying on the ground for months. The best climate is found in the higher valleys. The Natives of Kurdistan are subject to a fever which they call 'ghera- nitee' that is, heaviness. It continues three or four days, and is^ carried off bv a profuse perspiration which leaves the patient very weak. Ibis gener ally prevails in the spring, but is seldom fatal. In Kurdistan the camel is but little used, owing no doubt to the moun tainous nature of the country, but his place is amply supplied by other animals. Goats and sheep are met with in large flocks, and the wool of the latter is particularly good, provided it is carefully washed. The buffaloe is not so common as in the plains, but oxen and cows are abundant and of full size ; they are used almost universally to carry light burthens, chiefly of corns, which is balanced over the back of the animal in a stout double bag made of thick woollen cloth. The horses, which are very fine, are reserved exclusively for riding. The Turks and Persians obtain for their cavahy a great many horses from Kurdistan, which, according to some estimates, could annually supply 60,000 to 80,000 of these animals, but such numbers could scarcely fail to drain the country entirely if the demand were to be kept up year after year without intermission. It is impossible to arrive at any estimate of the population of Kurdistan as a whole, and JL will, therefore, collate what is said on this subject by thsKUR various authorities. Mignon, who is one of the oldest of these, gives the population as follows, viz :— Kurdistan Proper, i.e., Lat. 35° to 38° Long. 43° to 46° ... ... ... 2,50,000 Ardelan ... ... ... ... 1,50,000 Adiabene ... ... ... 1,00,000 Total ... 5,00,000 Of these at least four-fifths are Kurds and the rest Christians and Jews. The clansmen of Kurdistan bear no proportion to the peasant race, the latter being at least as four on five to one. Rich estimates the number of nomadic tribes (in the Government of Sulimania only) at 10,000 families, or at seven persons per tent, 70,000 souls. Of the settled tribes, such as the Karmaz, Nurudin, and Shinkis, there are about 3,000 tents or 21,000, so that the total population of this portion of Kurdistan would be from 360,000 to 460,000 souls. The tribes who are under the Government of Sulimania are as follows :— First. —Clans who are settled and inhabit particular districts. Tn the District of Pizhder. —The Sekkir, the Nurudini. Of these two tribes there are about 100 villages, and they can muster about 1,000 musketeers. In the respective districts bearing their names :— The Shinkis 200 families ) m -i , i Ghellalis 150 ditto, j These two are pure clans. The Siwell. —The pure origin of these may be questioned, but they are at all events now a tribe, and do not mix with the peasants. The other districts are mixed. Some inhabitants are of the peasant, some of the clanish race, i.e., no village has inhabitants of one exclusive kind. ' Second. —Wandering or encamping clans :— ' TAe Jaf. —There are twelve branches of the Jafs. Of the true Jafs there are not more than 600 families; but under their protection there are fragments of all the tribes of Luristan and Persian Kurdistan, which makes the whole strength of the tribe amount to several thousand families. The tribe musters about 1,000 infantry and 300 horses, that is to say in their own defence. ' For the service of the Pasha they could not be prevailed on to furnish so many. The whole tribe only pay to Government a yearly tribute of thirty purses ; sometimes less. The other tribes pay much more in propor tion, because they are not so powerful, or so well protected. The Sheikh Ismaeli Kelhore Mendimi Kelo Gawani Merzink ... ... 80 or (This was originally part of the Bulbassis.) Tileko Koosa Hamadavend Sofiaveud ... ... 40 to 219 500 families. 200 ditto ditto ditto ditto 300 250 90 100 60 200 50 ditto ditto ditto ditto220 KUR Ketcheli Tchigeni Zangeneh (These are part of the Lak nation.) 40 ditto 40 ditto 4()0 ditto scattered in villages.

Kerwei ... ... 60 families Lor ... ... 60 ditto (These are of the Feili tribe.)

The Jafs, beinju* strong- and well protected, are daily acquiring additions to their numbers from persecuted members of other tribes. 'None of the above tribes are entire. They are only fragments of tribes, of which parts exist also in the territory of Sehna, of Kirmanshah, and of Luristan.' The four great tribes of Northern Kurdistan are Bahdman, Bohtan, Hakari, and Rowandiz. Of these Anisworth estimates the Hakari at 27,840 souls. 'The Kurds, says Kinneir, under the appellation of Cardu Chai, are men tioned by the earliest of the Grecian historians, and they themselves still boast of being the direct descendants of Noah. In religion, indeed, they are changed; but in the rude and barbarous customs of this people little alteration has taken place since the time of Xenophon. Possessing a wild and inaccessible country they have never been completely subdued, and continue to live under the rule of a number of independent Princes, who g-overn their subjects as absolutely as either the King- of Persia or the Grand Seignor. The Kurds are brave and hospitable, but in other respects far more un civilized than any of their neighbours. They are robust, hardy, and temperate, and live to so great an age that it is not uncommon to see men an hundred years old, in full possession both of their corporal and mental faculties. They are averse to settled habits. War and rapine are their delight, and murder and parricide they hardly contemplate in the light of a crime. They are seldom taught to read and write, but excel in the management of their horses and arms. They speak a language of their own, and dress differently from either the Persians or the Turks. They are divided into different tribes, proud of their descent, and fond of tracing the families of their Chief to the most fabulous ages. The most powerful of these Chiefs are the ^ alis of Ardelan and Sulimania. The former, although he condescends for the preservation of peace, to pay an annual tribute to the King of Persia, is, in every other sense of the word, independent. He has the powers of life and death over his vassals, but governs them more as a patriarch than a tyrant. He is said to be the lineal descendant and representative of the Great Salah-ul-din, (Saladin) and holds his Court at Sehna, his capital, GO miles from Hamadan, and 77 from Kirmanshah.'221 ' The tribes of Kurdistan may be divided into two classes, namely those who live in tents, and those who have fixed habitations. The former, on the approach of winter, quit the more lofty regions and retire gradually towards the warmer climate of the south. There they remain during- the cold weather, and return to their own country about April and May. Like other men and nations, they are creatures of circumstance and education, but possessed of natural qualities that might be turned to good account. Bold they are and hospitable after a fashion, but this last virtue has been sadly dimmed of late years by poverty and oppression. Like most pastoral and patriarchal people, they are distinguished by a strong love of kindred and tribe, which renders them fierce and violent in their quarrels, each adopt ing the feud which has arisen from offence to a clansman, and perpetuating it by a series of remorseless murders. Far from cruel by nature, these feuds, and their fondness for war and warlike occupations, tend to make them reckless of spilling blood, and cause them to hold human life at less account than it is rated at in more peaceful countries, yet their wars are not deadly, and the very consciousness of the interminable consequences of shedding blood operates as a wholesome restraint upon their passions, when mere feel ings of pity or a moral sense of crime would be too weak to prevent murder. In person the Kurds are well made and active, differing perhaps but little essentially from their neighbours, the Persians. But the national features are strikingly peculiar. The cast of countenance is sharp, the form of the face oval, the profile remarkable from the prominence of the bones of the nose, and the comparative retrocession of the mouth and chin, which communicate to its outline a semicircular form. The eyes are deep set, dark, quick, and intelligent; the brow ample and clear, but somewhat retreating, completing the shape assigned to the profile, and the general mould of the features by far more delicate than those of the Persians which usually are somewhat too strong. In Kurdistan you would look in vain for a snub nose. The petite nez retrousse is unknown among them. The mouth is always well formed and the teeth fine. The hands and fingers small and slender. In short, there is something of elegance about the Kiirdish forin, which would mark them as a handsome nation in any part of the world. The same remarks apply to the women. When young they are exceed ingly pretty, but when old, the sharp prominence of feature, which charac terizes them in common with the men, is assuredly unfavourable to beauty, and they soon appear old and withered. They do not wear veils like the Persian women, the utmost practised in this way being to bring the end of the handkerchief, with which their heads are covered, across their mouths and chins. Their life, duties, and occupations resemble in all respects closely those of the tribes of Persia. The women of the richer classes, living in towns, remain in the harems of their husbands or fathers, and veil when they go abroad. The poorer, and even those of the higher orders, living in villages or tents, perform the same duties as those of other wild tribes do. The people of this country call it Karmanj, the European name being unknown. Almost every Kurd or Kerad (speech) is mounted, and armed generally with a gun and sabre, but higher up in the mountains he is to be seen protected by stout leggings, clad in loose robes, with a showy vest beneath; on his head is a gay-striped turban, hanging loose in a fanciful manner on one side, and he is mounted on a spirited horse. Occasionally he is provided as in ancient times, either with javelins about three feet nine222 KUR inches long, which he hurls at his enemy with great dexterity, or else with a bow made of horn, nearly six feet long-, and slung- at his side ready for use, with a supply of arrows in a leather quiver at his back. The bow resembles that of the Turkmans. The Kurds consider it to be either a mark of disgrace, or a symptom of extreme poverty to be seen on foot, and therefore they are not only almost invariably mounted but accustomed to move from place to place in large bands always well prepared either for attack or defence. As bodies of them are seen occasionally in a kind of wadded armour, their appearance, when coming at full speed, and showing hostile front, is but ill calculated to make a party of travellers feel at their ease, especially at night, and in the dark shade of a mountain pass. But when the first salutation has taken place it is immediately discovered that this formidable array is intended rather for defence than attack, for the Kurds, having ascertained that the presumed foes are really peaceable, generally become so themselves, and not only allow the traveller to proceed unmolested, but appear willing to per form any act of kindness when needed. In fact, the Kurds, like most other Eastern people, the mountaineers especially, are really hospitable; they will readily share their house and their rough fare, such as bread made of acorns, &amp;c., with those who chance to become their g-uest for the night. # O ^ O # The villages of Kurdistan, which are from necessity generally placed on the sides of hills, are small but numerous; and the houses are roofed with ponderous logs of wood, which are covered with several feet of earth. They usually consist of three or four dark rooms on the ground, communicating with each other, and separately allotted for the family, their cattle, sheep, goats, &amp;c., an arrangement which appears to have been resorted to as a pro tection from the severity of the winter; and, being suited to the climate and limited wants of the people, this mode of constructing houses has remained unchanged since the passage of the 10,000 Greeks through the country. The Kurdish houses, being formed in the sides of the mountains, possess a degree of comfort as to temperature which could not be obtained in ordinary buildings. After sunset, a bright lamp and a large wood-fire supply that light which is sparing-ly admitted during the day through one or two small windows, usually closed with oiled paper instead of glass. The Kurdish women do not cover their bodies so much with apparel, nor do they keep so much by themselves as in other parts of the East. Cooking and other domestic duties devolve upon them as usual, but, at intervals, they join the guests and the rest of the family circle round the blazing hearth. There are many different tribes in Kurdistan, and these are generally divided into small Chieftainships, forming separate Patriarchal Governments, under an hereditary Chief, called Dereh Bag, who possesses an extensive tract of land, which in all probability has been in his family for many generations. The rent charges drawn by the local Chieftain from the people are on a moderate scale, and the taxes paid to the Sultan do not appear to be by any means oppressive. There is a little commerce in tobacco, honey, gallnuts, as well as other productions of the country, and there might be much more if the people had any wish to create wants, or even to indulge those already known.223 The desires of the Km'ds seem to be limited to the possession of an excellent horse, with substantial clothing', and a sufficiency of the ordi nary food of the country, of which milk forms a large proportion. There fore if contentment be in reality wealth, the people of this country seem to possess it; and, so long as this state of things continues, they may be con sidered a The black tent of the Kurd is formed of the same material as that of the Turkman, but it differs from the latter in being of an oblong' shape, supported by only two or three poles. Like that of the Arab it is kept open towards the shaded side in summer, and the sheltered side in winter; when on the move, it is customary with the inmates of the villages com posing- each particular tribe to remove together and encamp around their Chiefs as they successively occupy suitable tracts along the line of their migration, southward or northward. A taste for bright and gaudy colours prevails among the Kurds of Asia Minor, w r ho wear a flowing, gay-looking striped turban, with a deep fringe, sometimes hanging on one side, but generally down the back. Ihe peasant women wear about the person a simple dress, fastened in front by a broad brass clasp over the trowsers, and their chief ornaments are small silver coins and beads attached to the hair, whilst those of the rich ladies consist of gold or coral, sparingly used : these last have a high pointed head-dress, which is no less remarkable than that of the men, and is composed of a great many colored silk handkerchiefs. Household occupa tions, spinning goat^s hair or wool, and making bags, carpets, &amp;c., are the emplovment of the women. Out-of-doors their faces are sometimes covered, but this is not the case within; they are passionately fond of dancing and other amusements, which they enjoy in common with the men; and their fidelity shows that they appreciate the confidence which is reposed in them. The character given of the Karmanj of Assyria is very different from that which is attributed to the Kurds of Asia Minor, among whom theft and robbery, indifference to their ill-understood religion, the absence of truth, and relentless revenge, extensively prevail. These bad qualities seem to be the natural result of their state of half independence, and of their bloody feuds which are carried on amongst themselves, yet it cannot be denied that the Kiird has some redeeming points; he is a good husband and father, a faith ful member of the patriarchal community to which he belongs, and he is ever ready to impart hospitality to strangers. He engages frequently in athletic exercises, and he enjoys in a high degree music, dancing, with other amusements, which are the usual indications of a mild disposition. That pride of birth to which Ihe Kurds and others attach such importance is almost unknown among them, and they differ from Easterns in general in giving portions with their daughters, instead of receiving a compensation on the occasion of a marriage. Camels, goats, sheep, and oxen constitute their wealth : the last are used as beasts of burthen, on which they place panniers to carry their families, and occasionally the large double bags filled with grain, which, as well as their arms and clothes, they purchase; the simple fare already mentioned satisfies their truly primitive w^ants. Most of the Kurds are wanderers, but some branches of this people are located on the slopes of the mountains and the crests of the hills, which enclose the valleys of the Sajur, the Kersin, Afrin, &amp;c. In these portions of the country the Kcrmanj have been allowed to retain the Patriarchal224 KUR Government; the Boyali Beg*, or Chief of the district, being answerable to the authorities appointed by the Sultan for the taxes, labour, and duties to be performed by his people or tribe. All the working and industrious portion of the population of Northern Kurdistan, are Armenian and Nestorian Christians, living- in a state of serfag-e, they being' the property of the local Kurdish Chiefs, who call them their ' Zar Kharldls,' a term signifying bought with the yellow, meaning gold, as, in fact, they are bought and sold in the same manner as sheep and cattle. This custom originated of course in the absence of any recognised Government, and in the consequent independence and power of the Begs and Aghas upon whom the Christians were dependent. To ensure their protection they first paid them yearly sums in cash, on the same principle as the Arab ' Khooa/ but sub sequently their increasing poverty and the avarice of the Chiefs made it impos sible for them to make the usual payments, and to avoid expulsion, there fore, from their old lands and country, they voluntarily submitted to the per nicious system under which they now live. Like the serfs in Russia, they are disposed of with the lands they cultivate, but cannot be sold individually, though the Chief can appropriate as much as he wishes from their yearly earnings, capital, or goods. The Kurds highly value the Armenians, whose industry is a source of profit; they treat them well too, better at all events than the Persians, among whom it is not uncommon to carry off their daughters, and force them to turn Mahamadans. The dames of Kurdistan are not held in the same restraint as their neigh bours in Persia a Turkey. Among the Khananishm (the dwellers in houses), only women of high rank conceal their faces, but among the dwellers in tents all exhibit their features without reserve. The women among the latter acquire great control in their families, and have consider able intercourse with the men of their encampment. It is very common for the young men to run away with the young women of another tribe or en campment, which produces violent quarrels, for a Kurd resents an affront of this nature with almost the same vindictiveness as a blood feud. ' The appearance of a Kurd of the upper-class, says Sheil, is very striking. His face is somewhat Grecian, but thin, resembling the heads to be seen at Shahpoor and Persepolis of the ancient Persians, from whom he is doubtless descended. His person is meagre, like that of an Arab. He wears an enor mous turban, generally a shawl; but among the Mikris it is a particular manu facture of wool and silk, imported from Musal, striped red and white, with a long fringe of red hanging down on the shoulders, and making a very strange appearance. His trowsers are of enormous size, showing that the owner is a horseman, not a pedestrian. He wears a short jacket, and over all the loose Arab abba, black or white, made of cameFs hair, and in his girdle the indispensable dagger. The Kurds are a grave people in public, though among themselves they are cheerful and fond of various pastimes. They speak with loud, boisterous voices, like men accustomed to pass their lives in the open air. A Kurd is not a man of honour like an Arab, who gives you a fair start from his tent before he attacks; neither is he so bad is that vilest of all tribes, the Turkmans, a compound of treachery and false hospitality.' ' The Kurdish Cavalry says Shiel are pretty good. They are chiefly of the tribe of Shekak. The large and variegated turban of the Kdrd looks well; soKUR does he too, with his wild, expressive, manly eovmtenanee; but they are shocking* ruffians. Their arms are a spear and a sword, and when they can afford the purchase a pair of long- Turkish pistols in their belt. They prefer riding on mares, either because they make less noise than horses in a maraud ing excursion, or from an idea of their supporting fatigue better. Their horses are small but hardy creatures of Arab blood. Several of the Chiefs pretended to be of Arab descent, though without much foundation for the assumption, yet they look like Arabs, thin, wiry, sinewy fellows. Their manners were very agreeable.^ It is a fine sight to see a body of 300 or 400 Kurdish cavalry in movement proceeding on a marauding expedition. They move in a compact body, making great way over the ground, at a pace half-walk, half-trot, like the Afghans; their spears are held aloft with the black tuft dangling below the point; their keen looks, loud eager voices, and guttural tones give them a most martial air. In front are the Chiefs, and by their side are the kettle-drummers beating their instruments of war with vast energy; they always lead the way.' Ihe peasantry in Kurdistan, says Rich, are a totally distinct race from the tribes, who seldom if ever cultivate the soil, while, on the other hand, the peasants are never soldiers. The clannish Kurds call themselves Sipah, or the ^Military Kurds, in contradistinction to the peasant Kurds; but the peasants have no other distinguishing name than Rayahs or f Keuylees ' in this part of Kurdistan. It is certain the clans conceive the peasants to be merely created for their use; and wretched indeed is the condition of these Kurdish cultivators. It much resembles that of a negro slave in the est Indies: and the worst of all is these Kurdish masters are not in the least ashamed of their cruelty to their poor dependants. ' Every one agrees that the peasant is in a moment to be distinguished, both in countenance and speech, from the true tribesman; nor would it be possible for him to pass himself for his countryman of nobler race. Ihe lurks call all Kurds, and have no conception of this distinction, the clansmen are quite a distinct people from the peasants, who they have the stupidity which the Turks are pleased to attribute to all. The treat- ment which the peasantry receive is well calculated to brutify them and yet tyranny equally degrades and brutifies the master and the slave; and it were not wonderful had the tribe and the peasant Kurd been equally stupid and unfeeling. 1 ^ 1 ' Hie Kurds arc not noisy or boisterous among themselves when talking like the Persians, but they are given to strange sudden shouts and shrieks. \V hen one Kurd wants to call another, or to attract his attention, he roars ou ^ ' H 0 ; Hamaka' ho (long protracted) Hamaka, ho, ho, ho; wurra wurra! The other always answers by a similar shout. The Jafs shout in this manner, and talk to one another from hill to hill. The Kurds seldom go along a road straight and quietly for any length of time. Without any motive, they will on a sudden give a shriek, dash their horses out at full gallop, and return again, when going a march or journey. ' i he Kurds are bold but unscientific horsemen. They push over any ground at speed, and twist and turn their horses about without any mercy. It is all done by roughness and force and mere sticking on, and they are not good judges of the breed of a horse. Almost all their horses, even of the Arab breed, become vicious, startlish, and restless. A Kurd prefers a 2^5 1Ehot-tempered horse with some vice; he thinks it sWb sMI ^ ^oWness in flip ruler The Arabs, on the contrary, are fine, tempeialt lioi^emc . horses, and there are n&gt;any 'h g^tlomen ^ ^ nd ^ horses, and there are many jvumis-n ^ o nTid keen them with their own hands.

The respect of the young for the old is particularly remarkable : the son never sits down in the father's presence, nor the nephew in that of the uncle, except by special desire, and then in a distant part of the room. Yet there appears no want of tenderness on the part of the elders, nor of willing and ready obedience or filial affection on the part of the young. At meals, though trays of victuals were brought in by servants who performed the more menial offices, the sons of the host wait on the guests and attend to their wants, handing water to drink, assisting them to such things as aie out of their reach, trimming the lights, and exerting themselves to increase the comfort of all. The servants, too, are treated with great consideration and even familiarity. Ihe great, it is true (that is the higher Chiefs), affect more state. The Khans have their ' lords in waiting,' their Nazirs or stewards, their Peish- khedmuts, head Furashes, &amp;c., &amp;c., like the higher Persian noblesse; but their domestic manners, are marked by kindness and good feeling. There is an openness and simplicity about many of these Kurds that is very refresh ing, and which often shows itself in their questions in a manner that amuses while it pleases.' 1' raser thus describes the dress of Kurdish warriors :— ' their head they wear a large shawl of striped silk, red, white, and blue, with fringed ends, which is wound in the most graceful manner round their red skull-cap. Its ample folds are confined with some sort of band, and the long fringes hang down with a rich fantastic wildness; their true Saracenic features, and bright black eyes, gleam with peculiar lustre from under this head-tire. Their body garments consist of a sort of ample vest and gown, with magnificent white Turkish sleeves, over which is worn a jacket, often richly embroidered and furred, according to the owner's rank. Their lower man is enveloped in ample 'shulwars/ not unlike those of the Mamlukes, into which, in riding, they stuff the skirts of their more flowing garments. Around their waist, instead of a shawl, they wear a girdle fastened with monstrous silver clasps, which may be ornamented according to the owner's taste with jewels, and in which they stick, not only their Kurdish dagger, but a pair of great brass or silver-knobbed pistols. From this, too, hang sundry powder-horns and shot-cases, cartridge-boxes, &amp;c., and over all they cast a sort of cloak, or abba, of camel's hair, white, or black, or striped white, brown, and black, clasped on the breast, and floating picturesquely behind. When riding they carry a small round shield depending from the left shoulder, and grasp in their hand a long slender spear. If in war time, and they are going on an expedition, in addition to these arms they carry a gun, and occasionally three slender javelins in a case which they can throw with great precision to the distance of thirty yards. Then they case them selves in armour, like knights of old, either in a shirt of linked mail, with helmet and armlets, or with a suit of platearmour, called Char-Eineh, consisting of four -plates of inlaid and damasked steel, made to fit back, breast, and sides, and which are a defence against anything but a ball strik ing them directly.' In Kurdistan the usual increase of grain is about five to ten to one of seed ; fifteen is an extraordinarily good crop. Wheat and barley are sown alternately in the same ground. They depend on the rain, which mode of 227228 KtjR agriculture is called f clem: There is a kind of corn called ' bahara/ which is sown in the spring, and requires artificial irrigation. In the plains the land is not allowed to lie fallow, but it is relieved by alternating the crops of wheat and barley. In the hilly country the land must rest every other year. Cotton must never be sown twice running in the same ground; some crops o tobacco generally intervene. . 'The cotton 'is all of the annual kind, and generally requires watering, though in the hilly grounds some is grown by the means of rain. Manure is applied only to vines and tobacco. Rice should not be sown for several years running in the same ground, which, however, may be employed lor other grain. The rice is chiefly grown in the district of bhahrizor. No hemp or flax is grown in Kurdistan. Much Indian-corn, millet, lentiles, gram, and one or two other species of pulse are grown. The plough is drawn by two bullocks. • ^ ' v- v i ti 'No trees of the orange or lemon genus will flourish in Kurdistan, llie summer heat is indeed more than adequate, but the winter is too severe for them. The risinous, or castor-oil plant, is cultivated all over Kurdistan ; sometimes in separate fields, sometimes mixed with cotton. ' The state of agriculture in this country differs, in some respects from that of Persia water being in general so abundant as to render irrigation unnecessary. Wheat and barley are the most common grains. Of the former there are two kinds, which are sown at three different seasons of the year the first in March and reaped in September the second in September and reaped in July of the following year; and the last in October and reaped the following August. When the second crop has attained the height of seven or eight inches, cattle are turned to graze upon it for a certain period, after which it is permitted to acquire its proper maturity. ' The valleys and plains of Kurdistan display the most abundant fertility, and the mountains too in general possess a soil of considerable depth, and the wild luxuriance of unforced vegetation proves their productive qualities. The order of cultivation appears to be thus: the plains and valleys are appropriated to grain, the southern slopes of the hills form vineyards, the northern produce the oil and tobacco plants, and on the summits and in accessible crags the goats and mountain-sheep browse upon the heath, while oxen, horses, and cows graze upon the pasture that skirts the villages. Wheat and barley are both plentiful and cheap; grapes are not so richly flavoured as the Persian, but cherries and other stone fruits are very fine. The Kurdistan walnut is the largest in the world, and nearly all the European fruits are very abundant. « The general elevation of Kurdistan and the height of its mountain ranges secures the province from the scorching heats to which the people of Mesopotamia are exposed in the very same latitude, whilst the cheerful vales and long terraces on the sides of the mountain boast of the gum tragacanth plants at the same time that they yield grain and produce the vine as well as other fruit trees. The forests, in addition to the ash and oriental plane, have the finest walnut trees in great abundance; and the oaks bear large gall-nuts of the very best quality. The honey, which is found in holes underground, or in hives made of mud, is remarkably fine as well as very plentiful; and it produces a fragrant wax in such quantities that it forms a constant article of export, with the gall-nuts, yellow berries, goats' hair, &amp;c. In addition to these, the valleys likewise grow silk, cotton,KUR tobacco, hemp, pulse, wheat, barley, nee, Indian-corn, flax, sumach, sesame.* and the castor-oil plant. Melons and pumpkins grow to an enormous size^ and flowers of all kinds, particularly the gig-antic rose, are abundant. ' But the most remarkable production in ancient Assyria is the celebrated veg-etable known here by the name of manna, which 'in Turkish is most expressively called Kudret-al-vassiz, or the Divine sweetmeat. It is found on the leaves of the dwarf oak, and also, thoug*!! less plentifully and scarcely so g-ood, on those of the tamarisk and several other plants. It is occasion- ally deposited on the sand, and also on rocks and stones. The latter is of a puie white colour, and appears to be more esteemed than the tree manna. It is collected chiefly at two periods of the year, first in the early part of spnng, and again towards the end of autumn; in either case the fjuality depends upon the rain that may have fallen, or at least on the abundance of the dews; for, in the seasons which happen to be quite dry,it is under stood that little or none is obtained. In order to collect the manna, the people go out before sunrise, and having placed cloths under the oaks, larch, tamarisk, and several other kinds of shrubs, the manna is shaken down in such quantities from the branches as to give a supply for the market, after providing for the wants of the different members of the family. The kurds not only eat manna in its natural state, as they do bread or dates, but their women make it into a kind of paste; being in this state, like honey,it is added to other ingredients used in preparing sweetmeats, which in 'some shape or other are found in every house throughout the east. The manna, when partially cleaned, is carried to the market at Mil sal in goat skins^ and there sold in lumps, at the rate of 4|lb for about 2^ But for family consumption, or to send to a distance out of the country, it is first thoroughly cleansed from the fragments of leaves and other foreign matter by boiling. In the natural state it is described as being of a delicate white colour. It is also still, as in the time of the Israelites, like coriander seed, and of a moderate but agreeable sweetness. Indeed Calmet, who savs it is met with not only in Arabia but also in Poland, the mountains of Lebanon, and other places, compares it to a condensed honey. Burckhardt, however, says it is of a dirty yellow colour, slightly aromatic, of an agree able taste, sweet as honey, and, when eaten in any quantity, it is purgative; he adds that the time of collecting it lasts six weeks. ' Kurdistan is watered by an infinity of noble streams, with a salubrious climate and rich soil; it yields to no other province for the variety and richness of its vegetable and animal produce, while its numerous mountain chains abound in mineral wealth. Among its natural vegetable productions gall, gum-tragacanth, madder-roots, and the Pistachio terebinthus, from which the natives extract a fine oil (used in making soap) are the most im portant, the value of the export of the former alone being upwards of £35,000. Oleaginous seeds and olive oil are produced in large quantities; and the quality of the former is so superior that it finds its way to many of the northern Gov ernments. Sheep's wool was exported in 1863 to the value of £70,000; and mohair, the produce of the Angora goats, that thrive so wonderfully in the neighbourhood of Jezireh, was eagerly sought after, and bought up by native traders from Kaiserieh and Constantinople, in the same period, to the amount of £20,000. The manufacture of native cotton cloths, shallees made from mohair, and short woollen cloaks, is actively pursued; and the ^shallee/ for tex ture and variety of colour and pattern, shows the extraordinary natural intelli- 229230 KUR o-once of tli6 Kurdish workniGn. Diarbakr itself is fiimoiis foi its silk picue- goods, similar to those of Aleppo and other parts of S} ria; but fiom its gieater cheapness and durability more in request among the poorer classes of the mountains between Diarbakr and the Black Sea. Sheep are expoited in laro-e quantities from the mountains and desert to Ale])po, Damascus, and Beyront; and camels, purchased from the Arabs, to Kaiserieh and other parts of Asia Minor. The uplands and hills abound in several species of polecat, marten, foxes, and wolves, whose furs add considerably in value to the sum total of the export list. A beautiful species of spotted lynx (wushek) mav be included among the former, although it is far more scarce than those enumerated. A rough estimate of the whole value of the vegetable and animal produce of the Pashalick of Diarbakr, whether consumed at home or exported, will amount to more than £ 700,000 sterling. _ &lt; In religion the Kurds are mostly IMahamadans of the Sum peisuasion. Rawlinson in these words gives the benelit of his experience to travelleis desirous of penetrating into the many wild and unexplored regions of the mountainous country of Kurdistan—' I consider attempting to visit Kurdis tan in anv disguise as quite impracticable, the protection of a Government, either Turkish or Persian, is fraught also with danger rather than with advantage. The most safe, and at the same time the most agreeable, way ot travelling in Kurdistan would be to visit, in the first place, a frontiei Chief, whose connexion with his Government, either Turkish or Persian, would oblige him to assist and protect the European recommended to his care ; this Chief then would be able, from his connexion with the tribes in the vicinity, to pass the traveller on to another Chief in the interior, and from thence, availing himself of the same means of introduction and protection, he might penetrate to still more remote regions until he had reached the objects of his search. Thus from the Persian frontier Ghafur Khan would be able to pass a traveller on to Julamerik, retaining some of the Hakarl Chiefs, who are usually with him, as hostages for his safe return. Ihe Hakan Chiet, mi'-ht transfer his charge to the Chaldean patriarch of Koch Hannes, talTin^ the same precaution for his safety, and under the protection of the patriarch, the Tiari tribes might be visited, with little danger. Perhaps upon the Turkish side from the Amadia frontier, the plan might be adopted with equal advantage; but any direct interference oi the Turkish or Persian Government would certainly be attended with extreme danger; indeed, I was assured at Ushnai that the tragic death of the lamented Schultz was owing entirely to this cause: when he visited Ushnai, Semed Khan, the Governor, offered to send an escort of his own Zerza Kurds with him to Julamerik, detaining a nephew of the Hakam Chief who was with him at the time upon a visit, as security for his sate return: Schultz unfortunately declined this offer, and preferred the direct protection of the Persian Government through the Afshar Chief of U rumiyah; he consequently returned to that place, and took with him as his guide an Afshar soldier, hateful to the Hakarris, as well from being the servant ot the Persian Government as from belonging to a tribe opposed to them m nation, in language, and in religion, and with whom they were constantly at feud. Schultz was thus regarded by the Hakarris as a Government emissary, and his enquiries about antiquities were explained by his supposed errand to survey the country and discover the best route tor the Persian guns.'231 KUR ' Of the Kurdish character Mignon saj-s that oppression is directly the source of its chief defects, and in proportion as that fatal influence is weakened so rises the national character. Its nature is so elastic that it springs up, even in every momentary removal of the pressure; but its true displays are to be found where the tyrant dares not come. The greatest contrast to the inhabitants of the plains is to be found in those mountainous retreats where there are no foreign inhabitants. Here the Kurds are hardy and heroic, passionately fond of their homes and country, and subsisting on little. The picture has its dark side. They are inconstant, envious, and trea cherous. But it must be remembered, that these defects would be the natural qualities of any people leading such uncertain and distracted lives. In his most inaccessible hold, pent up amid wild tracts of country, shut out from general communication, liable to frequent and sudden inroads of a merciless enemy, and from his cradle to his grave either the spoil or the antagonist of the oppressor. Poverty, suspicion, loneliness, a life of hazard, flight or attack, what original constitution of virtue could have attained its true stature ? There is no national character that would not have darkened under this perpetual rudeness of fortune. It is really astonishing that the Kurd retains any qualities entitling hin to rank among men. For sevei'al centuries Kurdistan has been a continued scene of war, turbu lence, and robbery. Some of its eastern districts have remained in the power of the Persians, who have never been able to reduce to subjection the various Chieftains in the north and south, who claimed a predatory independence. The form of the country, indeed, is sufficiently favorable to such pretensions, being intersected by mountainous tracts, over which it is extremely difficult to conduct an army. The Eliats, or wandering tribes, roam over its exten sive plains, and the Persians, from Azarbijan, have long carried their ravages not only over the frontier, but into the heart of the country, over its ranges of hills, and to the gates of its towns. The desolation and want of security can hardly be conceived when occasioned by these ravages. In some tracts the whole open country has been swept, the inhabitants having been put to death, or carried away as slaves. The consequence is that numerous small towns, particularly near the frontiers, have been abandoned, as well as all cultivation. The peasant goes out to his labour with his matchlock slung over his shoulder. All intercourse between villages is carried on with the greatest timidity, and at intervals; when a sufficient number of men can be collected to form a ' kafila/ and to resist the bands of robbers, even these are fre quently attacked, and the merchants and travellers composing them not only plundered, but detained in captivity or murdered. This state of things has given rise to extensive dealings in slaves. The tribes which range the deserts differ in their habits, according to the circumstances in which they are placed. In some parts they are pastoral, hospitable, and kind to strangers; in others they are reserved, and shun all intercourse; in others again predatory, cruel, and ferocious. Those of the latter description are to be found near Lake Van, and in Armenia towards Arzrum. We find them to the north, on the borders of Georgia, plunder ing villages, committing outrages, attacking towns, and carrying off Georgian and Circassian girls. On the south they dispose of their captives to the traders who supply Baghdad and other Turkish cities; and on the east and west are found the wild mountaineers, who are not naturally cruel, but obliged in self-defence to assume a fierce character. This effect can only be232 KUR ascribed to the distracted state of Kurdistan, and its inability to afford security to the people. So great and manifest are the natural advantages of KurdistSn that the verdict of all travellers is unanimous in commending the fertility of soil But since the beginning of that time from which we have any authentic, records of his history, wars, dissensions, and violent distractions ha\c scaled away improvement, and Kurdistan is still '—an unweeded garden that grows to seed.'' ' Mignon says—Without any exception I may safely aver that Kurdistan is the loveliest country I ever beheld. The passes over its mountains aie of the highest interest to the traveller, as they offer opportunities of observing portions of the globe, which must from their nature have been m their pic- sent state since their creation. In their recesses, he may observe from the wonderful and varied position of their stratification what ha.\c been the operations of nature on the grandest scale. These passes are in truth the most sublime and solemn solitudes that can possibly exist, and louse the breast of man to meditations bordering upon rapture. ' The Kurdish villages, although small, are very numerous, and all built in the same style, of large unhewn stones, which have no binding material. They consist of an outer and inner room only, having a floor, and walls plastered with mud, and a roof formed by cross-beams of wood, covered with reeds, or straw matting, and over that again a thick coveiing of mud. They are generally seated upon the declivity of a mountain, and some idea may be formed of the steepness of their streets from peculiarity of position, that the top of one house forms an exact level with the bottom of the one above it, and each house having a door that opens into this space; the loof of one dwelling forms a level walk for its next or upper neighbour. &lt;{ Amongst those tribes whose morals have been vitiated by habits of lapine, it is unsafe to trust to the strongest professions. F or there can be no doubt that cruelty and avarice characterize this people, though they by no means hoard their money, always preferring to convert it into horses, mares, lances, pistols, swords, and ornaments for their women. Cash is not very current amongst them, purchases being made by barter. ' The females are not shut up in nor are they veiled like those of most Mahamadan countries. On entering the house of a Kurd, you are not annoyed by women rushing in every direction to escape notice. Women in company with men are constantly met without veils. It is true they are not permitted to eat with the men, but in e\ cry other respect they are entirely free. However they are not possessed of those personal charms which might impose the necessity of restraint, though a few of them, if dressed up in the Parisian fashion, would be considered pretty brunettes; their complexions are not so dark as to veil their blushes. 1 hey are generally small and well made, and have large dark eyes, the appearances of which they take great pains to show off to the best advantage, t hey dye their eye-brows with a collyrium called in the Arabic Khattat. It is reduced to a fine powder. The eyelids are painted with the ' Kabel, and the lashes blackened with a reed, which is passed between the 'eyelids. The angles of the eye are also tinged and prolonged, which makes it appear much larger.KUR ' Another fashion equally essential to Kurdish beauty requires that the nails of the hands and feet should be stained with ' henna and so very general is this custom that any woman who should hesitate to conform to it would be considered immodest. The soles of the feet are likewise daubed with the same coloring-. The fingers are partially painted; and to prevent the ' 1^1^ taking everywhere, the fair artists twist tape round them before they apply it, so that when the operation is completed, their fingers are fancifully marked with orange-coloured stripes, which is by no means improving to a fine hand. In fact, the delicate whiteness of the palm, and the rose color of the nail, is utterly effaced by this dye. ' In a large town like Sulimania, it is not to be supposed that the women enjoy the same degree of liberty as they do in villages; indeed, they are often much watched; and in the marriage contract, it is insisted that the bride shall exhibit those proofs of her innocence, which afterwards she is expected to confirm by her conduct. In fact, a bride would be returned to her parents, should she be unable to produce the testimonials of her virginity. They are certainly verv familiarly inclined, but it is said they are not backward in assuming the semblance of enticement, that the incautious stranger may proceed to improper liberties, upon which these artful females accuse the unhappy guest of freedom and insult, when their male relations seize upon his baggage and otherwise molest him. In their mode of life, the Kurds are habitually abstemious, subsisting on the coarsest rye-bread and manna; and when meat is introduced at their meals it has seldom undergone any further culinary preparation than that of boiling in plain water. Some travellers have spoken of their personal cleanliness, but on this point not much can be said in their favour. Their repeated ablutions very imperfectly remove the evils attendant on the length of time they wear their clothes. 'The Kurds have a practice of removing all the hair from the parts of the body where we suffer it to remain; and where we carefully shave, they as carefully cherish its growth. The women also practice depilation in the following way:—A thin cord is dipped into some particular gum, and drawn slowly over the parts, when it removes all that adheres to it. r i his process is extremely painful; but the remedy does not require a frequent recurrenco, as it either produces a complete eradication, or if a new growth appears, it is merely a soft down, which may be removed with facility. ' Another remarkable contrast between European and Asiatic taste is, that corpulence and bulkiness form the greatest trail of beauty. It is natural enough, therefore, that the females are desirous of acquiring a superiority in this particular. They accordingly eat a great variety of sweetmeats, candied fruit, and particular vegetable substances, grated down, and mixed with conserves. This latter composition is thought to be adapted both for vigour, and that en hon point, which is so delightful to their admirers. A Kurd ot some rank, in describing the charms of his intended bride, said with much seriousness—' She is as large as an elephant I' He considered this comparison the very acme of perfection.' {Monteiih—Sheil—Glascoit Mignon Chesney—Kennier—Moriere—Taylor—Preiser—Rich.)

The first assault was repulsed with very severe loss, notwithstand ing which Kutlerousky made another and, leading it himself, was successful. But he himself was dangerously wounded in the head and half his force disabled or killed. The Persian loss amounted to 3,000 men. It has since remained in the hands of the Russians and has become a considerable trading port. The average temperature of this place was in— 1848 winter 34 - 36, spring 55'62, summer 76'91, autumn 62'17. 1849 „ 41-90, „ ^ 55 04, _ „ 76*21, „ 59-02.

A river of the Russian district of Talish. [Chesney) LAUM—Lat. Long. Elev. A peak on the range which divides Georgia from Immeretia. It is a well-wooded hill. (AdicA.) LAUSKOUM—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Guriel in the Russian Government of Georgia. It is said to be well peopled. [Monfeitk.) LAZISTaN —Lat. Long. Elev. A district of the province of Tarabazun, Asiatic Turkey, which comprises the divisions of Goumirah, Surmenah, and Rezah east of that place. It stretches along the south shore of the Black Sea east from Trebizond. It is so wooded and mountainous that it does not produce grain sufficient for the consumption of the population, but not a spot capable of cultivation appears to be left untilled. Corn fields are to be seen hanging on the precipitous sides of mountains at which no plough could arrive. The ground is prepared by manual labour, a two- pronged full of a construction peculiar to the country being used for this purpose. Indian corn is the grain usually grown, and it is seldom that any other is used for bread by the people : what the country does not supply is procured from Guriel and Mingrelia.236 LAZ—LES The picturesque beauty of the Lazi coast is particularly striking-. The mountains rise immediately from the sea from 4,000 to 5,000 feet, clothed with dense forests composed principally of chestnut, beech, walnut, alder, poplar, willow, and occasionally small oak, elmash, maple and box, the higher part being covered with fir. No ship-building is carried on in this part of the coast, and there is no exportation of timber so that the forests supply only charcoal, firewood, and timber for the construction of houses and of boats used in the coasting trade and fisheries. The people are a hardy, laborious, and bold race, they are skilled in the use of a short rifle which every man carries slung at his back wherever, and on whatever occasion he moves, and they enjoy a high reputation as soldiers. A demand is always made on this country by the Porte to supply a certain number of men for the arsenal at Constantinople. At the general census taken of full grown men in the Empire, Lazlstan was found to have 18,000 men. The Lazl are celebrated throughout Turkey as forming the most deter mined garrisions in fortified places, and are highly prized as such, but they are much given to desertion, and will only obey their own Chiefs, besides being inveterate in their blood-feuds. They are divided into a number of small clans, but the union is intimate between them. Their origin is unknown, their language has a slight resemblance to the Georgian, but it differs from it sufficiently to be considered a separate tongue. They inhabit the head of the great range of Taurus, and their country is perhaps more strongly defended by nature than the Caucasus. They profess a nominal subjection to Turkey but pay no tribute; while on the other hand they receive large presents in arms and clothing from the Turkish Government. The Pasha of ArzrtJm can only obtain their aid as troops near their own country and by paying them very highly. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29 the Lazi on a sudden call brought into the field 12,000 fighting men, and this though in the depth of winter. [Brant—Monteith.) LEGCHDM—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Mingrelia, in Georgia Russia. [Chesney.) LEG LEG—Lat. Long. Elev. A low hill in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of the Tigris. [Jones—Rich.) LEI HUN—Lat. Long. Elev. A division of the Ilakari Kurds who inhabit an upland called by this name on the banks of the Berdi Zawi not far above its junction with the Zab. There are many villages and much cultivation scattered on it. [Ainsworth.) LEKHOURA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kartelinia in Georgia, which, rising in the south, slopes off the Caucasus, falls into the Kur. {Chesney.) LESGISTAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A country of the Caucasus, bounded on the north by the Tchetchen country, east by Daghestan, south by Sheki and Georgia, west by Kakhetia. It stretches on both sides of the Caucasus including both the north and south sides of the slopes of this portion of these mountains. It has a surface of about 10,000 square miles, which is occupied by the Avars, Zerkers, and other tribes who are subject to the Lesgis. This country may be described as a succession of narrow valleys or ravines, separating steep, lofty, and woodedLES mountains. These valleys together with the few patches of tableland occurring here and there between them are in general cultivated^ and produce wheat, barley, millet, oats, &amp;c., although not sufficient for home consumption. The people, therefore, chiefly depend for subsistence on their numerous flocks of horned cattle, sheep and goats, and on the occasional supplies of grain brought from the fertile districts of Georgia. Monteith says of the Lesgis :— ' The people properly called the Lesgis are, like all of the Caucasus, divided into many small independent tribes forming at one time, like Switzerland, a strong federation under the Shamkol which now no longer exists, the Russians having made an impression on them by fomenting their internal disputes. This people are divided into four tribes, speaking totally distinct languages. The Kafir Kumaks consists of 25,000 families. The Kajar Kumaks of 20,000, the Avars of 32,000, and the Ak Ktischas of 12,000, some other divisions, not included in any of these, may collectively amount to 18,000 more families, besides two considerable tribes of Tartars, Yakese and Undni, subject to the Shamkol of Tarku. Monteith made many excursions into the country of the Lesgis, from which he came to the conclusion that they were more civilized than the neighbouring nations whether Georgians, Persians, or Turks. hen the country is capable it is in the highest state of cultivation. The villages are large, the houses well built and clean, manufactories of cloth, silk, and silver are carried on in a very considerable perfection. This, however, is not the case with the tribes inhabiting the higher ranges of the mountains who are miserably poor and generally hire themselves out as mercenary troops to such States as may require their aid. The people of Biliem and \ar enjoyed the greatest prosperity. These two States were, strictly speaking, republican, they were governed by a Council and President who could be deposed at pleasure. ' In their military expeditions says Monteith they elect a Bulliad (guide) whose office expires with the service. The Lesgis are the bravest as well as the most turbulent of all the nations of Mount Caucasus; they are the terror and scourge of all the neighbouring coun tries, whose villages they lay waste, and whose inhabitants they carry into servitude. Like the Arabs, they have, from time immemorial, preserved their liberty and independence, and the rugged nature of their country must ever render it inaccessible to a foreign invader, most of them are Mahamadans; but the few tribes who yet remain in a state of ignorance, never change the object of their veneration, which is either the sun, moon, stars, or, in short, anything that has made an impression on their minds. It is a custom with these people to hire themselves out to fight the battles of their neighbour, at the price of twelve roubles the campaign, which must cease at the end of three months from the appointed day. They often take diiferent sides; for it is of no consequence to them against whom they fight, and it has not unfrequently occurred, that the Lesghar tails by the sword of his brother or most intimate friend. They are lightly dressed, according to the custom of the Tartars, and armed with a gun, pistol, dagger, and sabre. The Lesgis are a handsome race, well built, with black eyes and hair, but are smaller in stature than the Georgians. Their women surpass in sym metry and beauty all the females of Mount Caucasus, and fetch the largest prices in the markets of Constantinople. 'Nadir Shah attacked the Lesgis, but after a long and arduous campaign in which he lost 30,000 of his best men, he was obliged to content himself 237LES—MAD with the submission of the greater part of the Lesgis, including their Chief. The Lesgis then tried to induce the Russians to attack Persia, offering 1 to join with 60,000 men, but the Empress did not venture on so open a proceed ing, and confined herself to giving secret assistance in money and stores. ' The Lesgis were, however, much disheartened by Nadir's comparative success against them, and it was not till 1788 that they recommenced their destructive attacks, when a force of 2,000 men under Generals Lazaroff and Gonlakoff entered their country, and in concert with the men of Kakhetia engaged the Lesgis near Kara Agatar and totally defeated them with great slaughter. ' The Lesgis are decidedly a democratic race, and the people acknowledge no allegiance, but such as they may themselves choose to yield to the Chief of their various clans/' {Monteith—Kinnier—Chesney.) LIAJA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kartilinia which, rising in the mountains south of Tiflis, falls into the Kur River. [Ckesney.) LIZAN.—Lat. 36° 53' 50' Long. Elev. A village in Kurdistan on the right bank of the Zab River, 15 miles north east of Amadia, 35 miles below Julamark. It is a large village inhabited by Chaldeans. The cottages of this village are not all grouped together, but are scattered among groves and gardens. There is a rope bridge over the Zab below this village. [Ainswortk). LORI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A plain in the Bambak Division of Georgia to the north of Shuragel. It is surrounded on all sides by mountains and contains 1,650 square miles. {Chesney.) LORI.— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, about 75 miles west of Arzrum on road to Kara Hisar. It contains about 150 houses. {Suter.) M. MADAN.— A tribe of Arabs who reside in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey. They are fixed, not migrating like other Arabs; they exist upon the produce of their buffaloes which, with a few sheep and cows, form all their property, and live in huts formed of split reeds, along with the animals that form then suppoit, and which they scarcely exceed in intellectual endowments. It is from the notorious uncouthness and brutality of their habits th^t the other tribes of Arabs give the name of Madan, that is, ignorant, from two Arabic words, signifying not wise. They have also the reputation of being the most inveterate thieves of the whole country, and probably they are not a whit behind their neighbours in the art of petty larceny. ^ As foi themselves, they and their domiciles are certainly curiosities. T^he last are like large cages made of reeds, like split rattans; anything but w eathei -tight: nor docs tliG largest exceed eight or ten feet long by six oi eight broad. As for a division of chambers for men and women, nothing 238239 MAD—MAJ of the kind is dreamt of, even the young buffaloes make common property of the frail tenements. Each shed is surrounded by a little space inclosed by split cane-work and walls of brushwood which serve for defence as well as for fuel. Indeed, from a distance, little is visible but the piles of brushwood and thorns, some seven feet high. A single spark, would be enough to set the whole in a blaze; and it is astonishing that such an accident does not oftener occur; for there are fires of this very substance burning in numbers every night and morning in and among the inclosures. The human animals that belong to these dens of abomination bear certainly as much the appearance of the dregs of the human species as can well be imagined. Many of the adults are scarcely clothed; of the children, numbers are entirely naked; and as for their mothers, words will not convey an id^a of their faronche appearance. [Fraser.) MADEN—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, between Arzrum and Beburt. There is a copper mine close to it, which is worked by the villagers who are all Greeks. The houses are built of stone cemented with mud instead of mortar, roofed with turf and built against or into the hill side in such a manner that one might ride over them without discovering they were habitations unless he fell down the chimney or into the window which are alike mere holes in the flat roof. [Stuart.) MADEN—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, 60 miles north-west of Diarbakr. The village is so named from the copper and iron mines in its vicinity. Its town occupies a most singular position in the very heart of Mount Taurus. Surrounded on every side by black and barren mountains of great elevation it overlooks a prodigious chasm through which the Tigris forces a passage. It is unnecessary to dig to any great depth as the ores are generally found in the surface of the rocks. Copper and iron are the metals procured in the greatest abundance, but silver and gold have also been found. These mines yield handsome revenue to the Porte and are under the management of a Pasha independent of that of Diarbakr. MAJAMA— A collection of tribes who reside on the left bank of the Tigris in the Pro vince of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey. As their name implies, they are a large tribe congregated from minor families of Arabs, who are individually so small as to be unable to protect themselves, and parts of larger hordes, who have originally migrated from a distance on account of feuds or oppression on the part of the Gov ernment. They lead both a pastoral and agricultural life, and are only so far nomadic as to wander over the territory assigned them, which is the most northerly of the cultivated district bordering the Tigris and Dijeil. Parties of them are found in the Khalis district east of the ligris, whi ther they have gone in search of employment, but by far the greater portion have their residence on the west of the stream, and extend from Sumeycheh to opposite Samara. They bear the character of most arrant and expert thieves, not in the Bedouin sense of the term, who, like the Borderers of old, ' lift' whole droves of cattle at a time, and reckon ' border theft and high treason' true gentlemanly accomplishments; but as petty larcenistSj they, like the shark in the wake of a ship, will follow caravans with a prying eye until they observe something worth purloining, which they seldom240 MAJ—MAR fail in the end to secure. On these expeditions they are generally well known, and precautions are therefore taken, when a Majama is seen marching in company along the road. Not unfrequently they receive desperate wounds in following their favourite pursuits. {Jones.) MAJ H AL—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the province of TarabTznn, Asiatic Turkey, at the junction of the Jorak Sti and the Adjarachai, it contains 30 or 40 houses, there is a small district of the same on the right bank of the Jorak above the junction. (Guarracino.) MAJIL—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Shat-al Arab, three miles above Basra. Here is the Residency of the British Agent at Basra. It is a large building with plenty of accommoda tion and some Commissariat godowns surrounded by a thick date grove. {Wray.) MAKLl B—Lat. Long. Elev. A hill in the province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, situated between the Khazir and Gomal Rivers, about 15 miles north north-east of Musal. [Rich— Ainswortk.) MAKRAL—Lat. Long. Elev. A small port on the coast of Lazistan in the Province of Tarabizun, Asiatic Turkey, about 15 miles south south-west of Batum. MAL AKULASH—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, seven miles south-west of Khinis. It is small and inhabited by Kurds. {Brant.) MALATIA—Lat. Long. Elev. 2,780. A town in the province of Marash, Asiatic Turkey, situated about five miles south of the Tokma Su on a small tributary of that river. It contains about 200 houses. There is little or no wood near the town which is conse- qently exposed to all the violence of the sun's rays in summer. Formerly it was a place of more importance, b\it most of the inhabitants have now deserted it for Aspuzi. The Turkish inhabitants of Malatia are prover bially luxurious, particularly affect very gaudy coloured clothes. This place is very unhealthy in autumn. Out of a brigade of Turkish troops 3,000 strong, stationed here, 400 died on a single autumn. [Ainsworth.) MALOTAH.—Lat. Long. Elev. 6,200. A village in Kurdistan near right bank of Zab River above Amadia and below Julamar. It is situated in a valley overgrown with fennel and rank marshy vegetation, which is tributary to the Zab, and is inhabited by Kurds. {Ainswortk.) MAMASH.— A section of the Balbas, tribe of Kurds. They were formerly powerful, but having exasperated the Mir of Rowandiz, he attacked them and carried off the greater part of them as prisoners to Rowandiz, but some of them after wards escaped and settled in Solduz, in Balek and in Lahijan. {Fraser.) MANASS—Laf. Long. Elev. A river of Daghistan, Russian Georgia, which rises in the mountains of the Lesgis and falls into the Caspian about six miles south of Tarku. {Chesney) MARADIT.—Lat. • Long. Elev. A village in province of Tarabizun, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of Jorak Su, 18 miles south of Batum. It is a large village possessing a bazaar ofMAR about 70 shops built around a quadrangle. Tbo village itself is on the top of a hill half an hour distant from the bazaar whieh is situated on the banks of the river. It was placed in this position to avoid the effects of the fever which in the hot season prevails near the water. The shops of Maradit are supplied in small quantities with almost every kind of European manufactures consumed in these countries, as shawls, prints, calicoes, striped nankeens, and handker chiefs. The shop-keepers usually purchase their goods at Tarabizun except ing one or two of the most wealthy, who visit Constantinople once a year. {Guarracino.) MARAND—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Mingrelia, Georgia, Russia, on the left bank of the Rhion River, 60 miles above Poti, 24 miles from Kutais. The river is here 200 yards broad and 8 feet deep, and very muddy and filthy. It is navigable as far as this for small steamers, except in July and August, and for boats even higher. [Easfwick.) MARDIN—Lat. Long. Elev. 2,300. A town in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, 65 miles south-east of the town of that name, and 161 miles from Musal. The prospect from Mardin is one of the most striking that can well be conceived, not onlv from the almost infinite extent of cultivation that has stretched out at its feet like a map, from the numerous villages and hillocks with which they are studded and which dwindle away on the distance to a mere mole-hill, but also from the vast and almost boundless expanse of nearly level ground unbroken by trees or rivers, and for the most part sinking gradually from sight to the utmost verge of the horizon where everything is indistinct. It is situated on the south side and not far from the top of one of the most lofty mountains of the Mount Masius range, commanded by a castle which crowns the summit of the rock. It is difficult of access. On the north side it can only be approached by a narrow pathway which winds amidst the rocks and precipices : on the south the road is somewhat better, but still very steep, and about a mile and a half in length. Although in so elevated a situation, it has within itself a plentiful supply of finest water: and as the vine is cultivated with success in the recesses of the mountains, wine and brandy are made by the Armenians in considerable quantities. The houses are all built of fine hewn stone, and appear to be very old. The windows are small and grated with iron, and from the position of the town on a declivity, added to the narrowness of the streets, the buildings seem to rise progressively, one on the top of the other. The population of Mardin amounts to nearly 11,000 souls, of which 1,500 are Armenians and 200 Jews : the remainder are Turks, Arabs, and Jews. The Armenians have here several churches and a patriarch. The walls of the city are kept in tolerable repair, and a few old pieces of cannon are mounted on the towers of the castle which is now in a very dilapidated state, and has never been completely repaired since the place was taken by Timur. It was formerly the frontier town of the Province of Baghdad towards Constantinople, and was under the Government of a Musalim appointed by the Pasha of that province, but having rebelled about the year 1833 it was attached to the Province of Diarbakr. [Kinneir—Alnsworth.) MARGHAR SO—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Tarabizun, Asiatic Turkey, whieh falls into the 241 Ig242 MAR Jorak Su on the left bank about 20 miles below Artvln. This stream forms the boundary between the districts of Lazistan and Livaneh. [(jua.) icicino?) MAR HANAN—Lat. Long. Elev / ^ z A river of Kurdistan, a tributary of the Berdizawi River. (Cfiesney.) MARIEN FELD—Lat. ' Long. Elev A German settlement in the district of Kahetia, Russian Government of Georgia, on the river Jora. The settlers appear to be well off and contented, enjoying a secure position and protected from want by the equable produce of the soil, the corn grown is barley, wheat, and oats. 'I be climate is healthy and the sky almost invariably serene, seldom forty days rain occurring throughout the year. In summer the thermometer stands at 30 to 33 (Reaumur) in the shade, and in the winter, which begins about the middle of December, seldom much below zero. The natural aridity of the soil renders artificial irrigation absolutely necessary. (/ an Haxthausen.) MAR 1LIAS.—Lat. ' Long. . ^v. A monastery in Province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, situated about tour miles south-east of Musal. - - , The convent is situated in a little hollow, or valley, and is a bare secluded spot, fit for monastic retirement, commanding no prospect whatever. \ et in the spring, when all is green, it is a favourite haunt of the people of Musal, principally on account of the mineral spring hard by, which is in great repute here. The water fills an oval reservoir, and is sulphureous, the surface being covered with a whitish scum, beneath which it is quite clear and not warm. No tar is produced here, as in a similar spring in the neighbourhood at Ilamam Ali. . 1 . i i ii The convent is now a heap of ruins. The natives say it belonged to the Roman or Greek Christians, before the Mahamedan conquest of these parts, ; and that it was usurped by the Nestorians. Dhaber Bibars, the hero of the romance of El Dhaberia, was imprisoned, or said to have been imprisoned, in a subterranean vault under the convent. It was ruined by Nadir Shah. {Ric i.) mil MATTEI—Lat. Long. . Eley. A convent in the Province of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, situated 30 miles north east of Musal. The convent has much the appearance of a stronghold, being composed of two large towers, or buildings resembling towers, at each extio- mitv, united indeed by a common wall. Had this curtain been embattled, and the wall a little thicker, it would pass for a very tolerable Barons castle of the fourteenth century. It is situated on the very edge of the precipice, and the bare rock rises immediately behind it, in which indeed are ensconced many chambers, and parts of the structure. It is in short, built in the abrupt face of the mountain, like a martinis nest, and the general plan is not very easy to describe, it consists principally of the aforesaid towers and two courts between them, with an infinity of little detached holes, nooks, and chambers in the rock ; but from a great man} of them being now in ruins, it is evident that the whole establishment must at one time have been much more considerable. Indeed, it formerly seems to i iav ® been a place of strength, for Tlmurlang took it by storm. lie assaulte it from the eastern side of the mountain, and entered just above its sout east angle. There were then works built on the rock, which is now unprotected, and commands it. The present habitable part, and the enure , which is in the south-east angle, have been recently fitted up, but t e skeleton of this part of the design seems to have been preserved. In the243 MAR—MED highest part of the inelosure up the hill are seen some lines of large stones, part of the original building. This convent belongs to the Jacobites, and the Abbot is always a Matran or Bishop. The convent was founded in 334 A.D. by Mar Mattei, a Saint and companion of St. George, who fled from the persecution of Diocletion, and took refuge here. Having by his prayers healed the daughter named Ilavla, of the King of the Assyrians, he obtained permission to build this convent. [Rich.) MARNIK.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Mush, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of Kara Su river, 34 miles from Mush on road to Bitlis, from which it is 22 miles dis tant. It is large, and the inhabitants are Armenians. [Brant.) MART KOBI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Georgia, Russia, which joins the Kur in the district of Tiflis. MAS HAD ALL—Lat. Long. Elev. See Najaf. MASSAHT.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, 20 miles on the road from Bcburt, to Arzrum on the right bank of the Jorak Su. It is a small pretty hamlet situated in natural groves of dwarf oak, wild apple, and pear trees. The inhabitants own numbers of buffaloes who are kept principally for ploughing. [Stuart.) MAT1NEH—Lat. Long. Eley. A mountain range in Kurdistan immediately north of Amadia. It is a spin from Jabl Judi, and is ended by the Zab. [A 'uisworth.) MA VAT—Lat. Long. Eley. A district of Turkish Kurdistan between the Siwell and Karacholan rivers. It belongs to the Bebbeh Kurds, who conquered it from the Persians. [Rich.) 0 MEDGONDA—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kartalinia in the Russian Government of Georgia. [Chesney.) MEDIAT—Lat. Lorn Elev. A town in the province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, 70 miles north-east of Mardin, 30 miles south of Diarbakr. It is a collection of miserable hovels built of rough stone and inhabited exclusively, with the exception of couihc of the Turkish officials, by Christians of the Jacobite persuasion. About 10 minutes walk from the town, a building containing a convent and college contrasts greatly by its solidity, comfort, and elegance with the hovels tenanted by its supporters. The convent formerly possessed a line manu script library of Syrian authors and divines, but it was destroyed in a raid of Kurds. [Taylor.) MEDIYAD.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, 65 miles on the direct route from Jaziraibn Omar to Diarbakr. It is situated on a plain of the same name which is crowded with villages, and, in spite of the stones which cover every field, is covered with unirrigated cultivation but of poor and scanty crops. The only water procurable in this plain is fiom wells of great depth covered at the top with a large stone perforated to admit a bucket. The inhabitants are Yakubis, Kurds, and a few ^ ezids. [o/nel.) MEDJINGIRD—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the province of Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey, 50 miles nom on the road to Arzrum, from which it is 55 miles distant. Iheie is a foit244 MED—MEN here which overlooks the village, and which, however, only consists of a steep insulated rock, the natural crevices of which have been filled up with masonry. This place is entered asMeshingird in Monteath's map. (Ouseley —Morier.) MEGERI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Russian district of Karabagh, Georgia, on the left bank of the Aras, and about 12 miles below tjrdabad. The valley of Megeri is one of the most beautiful in the world, and in former times had evidently been densely populated, for churches abandoned but still perfect are thickly scattered on the slopes of the mountains which here rise to a height on the west side of 8,000 to 10,000 feet covered with forests. The trees are of no great size, and are much interspersed with apple, pear, and walnut, probably the remains of some former garden, or produced by seeds carried by the birds and wind into the once culti vated land. A rapid clear stream of considerable size runs through this romantic glen, which is about 800 yards broad, where the villages of Great and Little Megeri are situated, the whole space being filled with small en closed gardens surrounded by vines. Both villages are about half a mile from the Aras, here a rapid foaming torrent, fordable only in one place, about a mile and a half farther up the river. [Monteith.) MEHKAN1—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, north-east of that town. It is situated on the extreme edge of a ridge bounded by steep and rocky mountains, on one of whose peaks the ruins of the old castle of Mehrani frown down upon the smiling plain at its feet. {Taylor.) MENDAJAHA— A religious sect of Asiatic Turkey (whose name means 'disciples of John)/ which is found scattered in small communities in Basra, Kurnah, Mahamrah, and Shekh-al-shayok where there are about 800 families. Those of Basra are noticed by Pietro de la Valle, who says the Arabs call them Sabeans. Their religion is evidently a mixture of paganism, Hebrew, Mahamadanism and Christian. They profess to regulate their lives by a book called the Sidra, containing many moral precepts, which, according to tradition, have been handed down from Adam, through Seth and Enoch; and it is understood to be in their language (the Chaldi), but written in a peculiar character. They abhor circumcision, but are very particular in distinguishing between clean and unclean animals, and likewise in keeping the Sabbath with extraordinary strictness. The Psalms of David are in use, but they are held to be inferior to their own book. They abstain from garlic, beans, and several kinds of pulse, and likewise most carefully from every description of food between sunrise and sunset during a whole moon before the vernal equinox, in addition to which an annual festival is kept, called the feast of five days. Much respect is entertained for the city of Mecca, and a still greater reverence for the pyramids of Egypt, in one of which they believe that their great progenitor, Saba, son of Seth, is buried; and to his original residence at Haran they make very particular pilgrimages, gacrificing on these occasions a ram and a hen. They pray seven times a day, turning sometimes to the south and sometimes to the north. But at the same time they retain a part of the ancient worship of the heavenly bodies, adding that of angels, with the belief that the souls of the wicked are to enjoy a happier state after nine hundred centuries of suffering. The245 MEN—MES priests, who are called Sliekhs, or Chiefs, use a particular kind of baptism which they say, was instituted by St. John, and the Chaldee language is used in this and other ceremonies. The strict preservation of this tong-ue, (which of itself denotes a separate origin from the Arabs) together with the particular connexion between Palestine and the ancient people of Upper Mesopotamia, make it possible that these Sabeans may be descended from Sheba, son of Ketura, which would account for the great respect paid to the residence of one of their idolatrous ancestors (Terah). Ben Schunah calls the Sabeans Syrians, and adds they use the language of Adam in their books; and another writer, Ibn Koura, says their religion is the same as that of the old Sabeans. In intercourse with them they are found to be quiet and harmless, but exceedingly cautious, and unwilling to communicate. (Ckesney.) MENDALI.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the mountains and is believed to unite with the river of Badrae below the village of Baghshahi.

M ILL IS— A tribe of Kurds, who inhabit the Abdnl Aziz range in the Sulimania district of Asiatic Turkey.— [Chesney.) MINGKELIA—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Georgia, in Russia. It is bounded north by the IngHr River and Swaneth, east by Imeretia, south by Guriel, east by the Black Sea. Its greatest length from Rcdut Kala north-east, to the south-east corner of Swaneth is 100 miles, and its greatest breadth from the Rion River north to the Ingur where it leaves Swaneth is 90 miles. Its average length is about 90 miles and average breadth about 30 miles. Its area according to Chesney is 1,757 square miles, and to the Imperial Gazetteer 1,705 square miles. Mingrelia is divided into the districts of Sennakh, Legchum, and Zudget. In its north and east parts Mingrelia is mountainous, but as its rivers approach the sea, there is a stretch of comparatively level but swampy plain land of from 10 to 20 miles. The mountains of Mingrelia consist of the ramifications of the spur from the main ridge of the Caucasus which divides the drainage of the In^-ur from that of the Zheni branch of the Rion, and in the Legchum division a spur which divides the Zheni from the Rion. The mountains are generally precipitous as the main range of the Caucasus falls abruptly to the level of the sea in 70 or 80 miles. They are covered from near their summits to the plain with magnificent forests. The rivers of Mingrelia are the Ingur, the Khopi, the Zheni, the Rion, and the Pitsshora. There are no lakes of any importance, but near the coast, as near Redut Kalaetc there are marshes of large size. The climate of Mingrelia is said to be extremely unhealthy, so much so, that when the Russians first took possession of the coast they annually lost one-fourth of their numbers. But this is only applicable to the west and south parts near the coast, and there can be little doubt that in the mountains near the head of the Zheni river, there is a magnificent climate, and this is evident also from the fact that the Dadiuns of Mingrelia usually reside in this part of the province. I have no information whatever of the mineral and animal productions of the country. Chesney states the population to be 127,826 souls, and the Imperial Gazetteer 70,000, but it is not stated on what authority, and Monteith gives the populations at 20,000 familes or, at 5 per family, 100,000 souls. The Mingrelians says Van Haxthausen, nearly always ride and their appear ance is very remarkable, bearing, in their long brown girded dress with a hood drawn over the head, a striking resemblance to Capuchin friars. Their women go barefoot and wear kerchiefs of gold brocade. Here and there is to be observed the dark brown ' burka,' a thick and close cloak which serves for protection against cold and wet as well as against heat, when the external temperature is higher than that of the blood. The inhabitants of Mingrelia are divided into three classes—princes, nobles, and peasants,—although there is no essential difference between the 247MIN prinees and nobles: those of the latter class who are hereditary princes (J)sinoki and Desinardi), have the rank of village Chiefs. The other nobles (Sakur) have only sing-le estates and peasants. The princes and nobles are virtually independent of the Dadian, rendering' him no tribute or service, except that, upon the death of a father, the eldest son rides over to the JJadian's Court, and presents himself as his new vassal. The landed estates are all inherited by the eldest son, who shares with his brothers the personal chattels, and gives the latter a dowry, which, in cases of dispute is ixed by the arbitration of friends. The land is cultivated and used by the peasants, who are properly required to pay only a tithe; the most arbi trary oppression, however, prevails, the princes and nobles extorting from the peasants as much as they possibly can : whether the latter are actual serfs is not very clear. A peasant is at liberty to remove and change his master but in doing so he is obliged to leave behind one-half of his property, 'if a peasant steals away furtively, he may be reclaimed, but not after he has been registered in another commune: and if he has resided thirty years un disturbed in a place, he is free from any claim on him. The Dadian has only the revenue derived from his own estates and the dues paid by his peasants, who have nominally to give him nine roubles banco on each farm; the peasants are, however, generally too poor to pav this amount. 11J Ihe princes and nobles are at liberty to sell their estates to one another but not to any foreigner without the Dadian's consent. ' Ihere are few regular villages in Mingrelia, juerely here and there sino-le and lonely farms. Every Mingrelian is free to settle where he pleases in these primeval forests, he cuts or burns down a clearing in the woods builds himselt a log-house of the trunks of trees, hedges in the farmstead, to gether with a few acres for cultivation, and establishes his household The dwellings are log-houses, thatched with maize straw: they have two opposite doors, generally in the gable end, but no window or chimney. The interior is occupied by a single apartment, with the hearth in the centre. There is no furniture, although in the houses of the wealthier class may be seen 1 ersian or latar carpets. The houses and farms-in Mingrelia generally consist of log-houses con structed of cross beams laid one upon another. There is a door at each gable-end of the building, and sometimes the gable projects five or six feet resting upon pillars. Separate sheds are set apart for the cattle. The build ings are all surrounded by a fenced enclosure, and there are generallv o-ourds climbing up the walls, and trailing gracefully upon the roof The residence of the Dadian at Sugdede is thus described by Van 1 laxthausen ' The residence of the Prince of Mingrelia stands on a plateau upon a hill, one side of which is covered down to the little vallev whence we ascended, with about two hundred houses find small farms, inhabited bv the attendants of the Court and Civil officers of the Prince. Upon the other side of this eminence lies an open plain, with a number of fine old trees in detached groups; and in the midst of it stands the palace of the 1 rince. But let not the reader be led by this high-sounding name to oi m aii exaggerated idea of a residence which is quite an ordinary dwelling' not at all superior to a common European country-house; a square box, seventy feet long and thirty-five feet deep, with two stories, ten windows in front and five on each side: the house is tiled, and the walls are white- 248T MTN washed. The only peculiarity is, that a wide wooden gallery runs along the front of the second story, the access to which is by a staircase on the outside of the building; and from this gallery several doors open into the apartments on the second story, which has no communication with the lower one. Ihe space usually occupied by a staircase and landing-place within side the house is thus saved, and the whole of the interior devoted to apart ments. ihe lower story is inhabited by the Court servants, and contains also the kitchen, store-rooms, &amp;c. The upper story is the residence of the Prince and his family.' The soil of Mingrelia is exceedingly fruitful and bears excellent crops of maize and millet; tobacco also thrives in Mingrelia, but its cultivation is ill-understood. Oats are not grown here at all, and barle}' is used as fodder instead. The inhabitants pay their lord, here the reigning Prince of Min grelia, a tribute from the produce of the soil, maize, millet, or cattle accord ing to agreement. The forests have everywhere been thinned by clearings for these isolated farms, which are generally situated upon some small eminence. The forests of Mingrelia are magnificent, and it is veiy seldom that finer beeches, oaks, elms, fir trees are to be seen. In addition to these are found planes, chestnuts, walnuts, olives, laurels, and cherry trees, the native habitat of which hxst is said to be Mingrelia where these forests are not too dense to allow underwood to grow, especially when composed of elms; vines have twined around the trees, festooning them from branch to branch. The vines appear to grow perfectly wild, none caring to cultivate them, or laying claim to their possession. Mingrelia is divided, after the Russian manner, into circles, with a Chief at the head of each, who has jurisdiction in all cases of dispute under the amount of two hundred roubles banco. There is a higher tribunal, with jurisdiction over the whole countiy, to which appeals may be preferred. These institutions, however, are but feeble attempts to introduce European forms of administration, the mere shadows of legal order, exercising in fact no active authority; the people are with difficulty accustomed to such a system, and the judges are perfectly incapable of fulfilling properly their duties ; they act simply as subordinate police functionaries. The nobles in this country all acknowledge the Dadian as their feudal lord and sovereign. -They are obliged to render him assistance in war, and in certain cases he has the power to declare their fiefs forfeited, but this requires the assent of a Court of Vassals. The Dadian, in common with his vassals, has peasants under him, who are divided into two classes, one, consisting of those settled immediately around the Court or residence of their lord and master, cultivate his land and perform other services, in return for which the lord is bound to support them and their families; the second class consists of the regular husbandmen, who till their own fields and pay their lord a tribute of the produce,—maize, millet, and cattle. The Mingrelians formerly went in troops to Georgia to take service as farm-labourers, for they are stronger and more industrious than the Georgians, but of late a check has been put to this, to prevent the country, which is thinly inhabited, from being entirely depopulated. In loading corn and in all work requiring a sudden exertion of strength, such as lifting a beam or rolling a tree, they utter a sharp and inspiriting cry. The revenue of the Dadian consists almost entirely ©f natural produce, and as 249 Ih250 MIN—MON there is no good market for this, its pecuniary value is small compared with the extent of a hundred square miles of fertile territory. For months to- gether the Prince has frequently not twenty-five roubles to meet the petty expenses of his household. His sole money-revenue is derived from the forest-lands, which is collected in the most wasteful manner. In the sixteenth century the Georgian Governor of Mingrelia, threw off the yoke of Georgia and assumed the title of Kheselpe, or King; his successors maintained their independence to their subjection by Russia.

Long. Elev. See Mediat. MONTEFIK. A powerful tribe of Arabs in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, who occupy the banks of the Euphrates from Korna to Samavat. The Shekh can bring into the field 4,000 horse and a proportionate number of foot. In the summer he resides at Nahr-ul-Antar, a small town on the Euphrates a few miles above Shukashm, but in the winter he is always encamped. It is one of the largest and most powerful tribes. Eraser says of it,—' It originally consisted of two principal stocks, the Ajwad and Ben-i-Malik, who are both in turn deducible from a very ancient tribe called ZaltSn, whose summer haunts appear to have been much the same as those of the present tribe, extending from Sharaf to Wassit in Lower Chaldea, on-the left, and from Samara to Suk-u-Shiokh, on the rio-ht bank of the Euphrates. Hostilities arising between these two branches, chiefly from a dispute about pasturage, produced a bloody battle between them] The Ajwad being reduced by their rival to a state of vassalage about two hundred years after the Hegira were united with them, and the tribe then first took the name of Montefik, or the ' united.' For a long time the Montefik derived their pecuniary resources only from the produce of their own lands; but about the year 1744 they obtained the right of dominion and taxation over a small tract of country above and below Suk-u-Shiokh, themselves at the same time paying a stated sum to the Sultan's treasury. One of their Shekhs, Saodun, however, thought fit to refuse this tribute, and advanced in hostile guise against Basra. He was sur prised by Suliman, a Mamluk officer of the Pasha, surnamed Abu Leila' or the ' son of night,' from the rapidity of his movements,—his army cut to pieces, and himself slain; minarets of the heads of the slam being built on the field of battle. But the victor was g-enerous to the family of the vanquished, and the Montefik once more lifted their heads from the depths of adversity. Taking advantage of the troubles of the251 MON Paslialic, and the threats of conterminous States, the Shekhs oi' the Montefik, particularly Sheldi lIumid-ul-Thamlr, contrived to acquire a great increase of power, and appropriated the whole country from the mouth of the Shat-al-Arab to Samava, defying the repeated attempts of successive Pashas to recover their lost possessions. The Pasha Dand, at length, by his intrigues, induced Ajil, nephew of Hamld, to revolt against his uncle, and elevated him to the chieftainship of the tribe. He was also so fortunate as to succeed in getting both Ilamld and his brother Hashed into his possession, by which means he once more broke the power of the Montefik and reduced them to comparative obedience, in which they still remain. They still occupy the banks of the river from Semava to Basra extending southward and westward far into the desert, from Shagra to the Vale of Hamir, west of Samara, &amp;c., possessing too, all the country between the Hye and Korna, with some tracts to the west of the former. Of the present number of the tribe and dependent clans it is difficult to obtain any correct account, as jealousy or ignorance gives rise to such con tradictory statements, that there is no trusting to what we hear. There is, however, good reason to believe that they do not fall short of from twenty to thirty thousand families. Their contingent to Government in case of need, but which they never supply, is twelve thousand horse men; and it is said they could, without much difficulty, muster nearly double that number. After the fall of Daid Pasha, they regained so much ascendancy over the weak Government of Baghdad, that they again got possession of the finest and most fertile tracts of the country, for which they paid nothing; but these acquisitions are fast producing the meritable effects of such property j its new masters find themsel\ es obliged to reside upon and protect it, and thus to make the first stop from a noma dic to fixed life, from a purely pastural to an agricultural people. Instead of wandering from place to place, the Montefik now congregate and linger far within the bounds specified, and generally near the rivers, cultivating extensive tracts, and planting groves of date-trees along its banks. Still, however, so strong is the Arab prejudice against a fixed life, that only the lowest and least esteemed branches or individuals among them will condescend to be Fellahs, or operative eultivatois; the rest continue under tents, moving about within a contracted space, sending their flocks and herds to feed over the wide tracts that, under present cir cumstances, are unfit for cultivation, but which, in times of old, were like a garden. Yet these proud wanderers, the real owners of the soil, though scorning to labour themselves, not only condescend to enjoy the comforts derivable from agriculture, but exact them to the utmost from the serfs. They make the Fellahs work hard for them, or each little Sheikh, or head of a family, let out to the cultivators such portions of land as may have been assigned to him, screwing out of them as high a rent, and exacting as much extra value as he can get, while he wanders at will, enjoying the lazy life he delights in. Jones says of the tribe:—' The chief family is descended from one ot the ancient Sharlfs of Mecca, whose name was Maneh, and who had ned from the holy city, fearing the consequences of a feud in which he w as involved. It would take too much time to recount, in the present paper, the history of Maneh's proceedings. It will suffice to say that, having by his talents worked himself into authority in the districts which the tribe inhabits at present, he managed to bring the various families undei oneMON-MOZ head. Thus united they took the name o£ Montefik as that of the tribe; at least such is the report. Its direct genealogy is given as follows :— ' Maneh married the daughter of Barakat ibn Mutlij-esh-Sharif, and had offspring. Mahamad ... who begat Agll ... who begat Sadrm ... „ Mahamad ... „ „ Thamir ... „ „ Faris ... „ „ Mahamad ... „ „ Agil ... „ „ Thamir ... „ „ ' The chief families of the tribe were from the Beni Timim, the Beni Malek el Ajwad, the Beni Syud al Khafajeh, Beni Rekab, and the Bednr. ' The tribe is now divided into two parts, the al Ajwad portion inhabits the districts north of Siikal Shiskh around Semaweh, and the regions of the llye river; the southern Montefik districts south of Siikesh Sheyukh to the Persian Gulf, eastwards as far as Hawlza, and north-east as far as the Hud, are in the possession of the Beni Malek, improperly pronounced Malick. With the exception of the house of Sheblb, the tribe professes the Shla faith of Islam. That name applies to the family of the present Sheikh, as does the name of Sadun. These are of Sfini principles. Their war-cry is ' Azyud,' while that of the Beni Malek, or the Beni Tenan ez Zeydan, as they are sometimes called, is ' Ye tun.' Sukes-Sheyukh is the chief seat of the family governing the tribe. It was a favourite mart of the Arabs, and much trade was carried on when the Montefik were at peace with each other. Many influential traders resided there, but the late troubles have sent them away to escape from the rapacity of the contending Sheikhs. The tribute paid to the Baghdad treasury by the tribe varies according to its strength, atid the means the Turkish Govern ment has of enforcing it; but ordinarily it may be computed at a lakh and a half of Shamies a year in money and presents to those in power. The tribe is rich, however, and could afford to pay much more than it consents to do. The whole date districts are in its hands, and it further possesses abundance of cattle, horses, and flocks, besides large herds of camels. The territory is rich also in ; rice grounds, and there are many tribes of cultivators living, even rich, under Montefik protection. Of these the Ahl Jezair and Beni Mansur are powerful bodies in themselves. [Kinneir—Fraser—Jones) MORAD SC.—Lat. Long. Elev. See Euphrates. MOX St—Lat. Long. Elev.

It is very, indifferently built, most of the houses being of wood, plastered with clay, covered with straw, and only one story high; but has rather a cheerful appearance in consequence of the beautiful and well stocked gardens which every where surround the houses, the best edifice is a Roman Catholic Chapel; there is also a Russian Church. The inhabitants live chiefly by the products of their gardens and vineyards, and by the manufacture of morocco leather, and a kind of spirit prepared from grapes.

A town in the Province of the same name, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of the Tigris, 220 miles above Baghdad. It is situated in so low a positition that the Tigris often rises to the level of the houses. It is surrounded by a wall of stone, which, however, is broken down in many places. It has eight gateways. The streets are dh'ty and irregular, and the houses are partly built of brick and partly of stone, and as timber is scarce and dear the roofs and even the ceilings of the apartments are vaulted. The citadel is situated on a small artificial island on the Tigris. The principal buildings of Musal are a college, the tomb of Sheikh Abdnr Kasim, and the remains of a beautiful mosque, the minaret of which, built by Nur-udin, has a fine effect. There is also a Pasha's palace, and near it the Telegraph Office, which is a good, roomy building, and a Chaldean Cathe dral, built whollv of marble from the neighbourhood. The interior of the Cathedral is well proportioned, and has two aisles and altars, and the centre archway and alter piece are remarkably handsome. Handsome new barracks have been erected outside the walls near the Tigris. The population of the town is variously estimated at 35,000, Turks, Kur Is, Jews, Armenians, Nestorians, and Arabs by Kinneir, 40 to 45,000 by Ains- worth, 20,000 by Chesney, and 40,000 by Southgate, of whom 6,000 were Christians.254 MUS There are many handsome coffee-houses, baths, Khars, and bazaars in the town, and Goldsmid remarks that its Moorish gateways are pleasant to the eye from the many quaint old-fashioned figures seen beside them, which almost recall forms and faces of our own country in the reigns of Henry Vll. and Edward A I. This city has declined in commerce as in every thing else. At present its bazaars are small and inferior in appearance, and its streets thronged with poor. In point of trade, it is chiefly a thoroughfare for the traffic between Baghdad, Syria, and Constantinople. It has, however, considerable commercial intercourse with the interior of Kurdistan. Its principal manu factures are napkins and other cotton stuffs, such as chintz, shawls for tur bans, and calicoes. It was formerly celebrated also for its muslins, hence the name of that description of fabrics, manufacture of which was carried on to a great extent. The wine, bread, and cheese sold here, are all of excellent quality. The climate is extremely hot in summer, and the winters mild, although there is sometimes a fall of snow, which continues on the ground for a day or two. In the vicinity there are several warm sulphur springs, also some extensive quarries of marble, so soft in quality that it can be cut and hewed like wood, and is much used in building for particular purposes. The city has been repeatedly devastated by famine and plague. On one occasion of this kind, where both were combined, or quickly followed each other, it is said that 100,000 persons were cut off. The climate of MQsal is proverbially healthy, and there are several mineral springs within a short distance of the town. On the west of the ligris the environs of Musal are wholly uncultivated; which circumstance, combined with the great extent of the burying-ground under the walls, gives it a . gloomy and melancholy aspect. [Soutkgcite— A innelr—Ainsworth (joldswid.) MOSH—Lat. 38° 46'30''. Long. 41° 29'30'. Elev. 4,692. A town in Province of Mush, Asiatic Turkey, 75 miles south south-east of Arzrura, miles north-east of Diarbakr, very finely situated on and around a conical hill at the foot of the ridge of Jebl Nimrud. Mush is a town as miserable in appearance as in reality ; it contains about 700 Mahomedan and 500 Armenian families. The bazaars of Mush are large and well supplied, and there are seven mosques and four churches in it. The Armenians form the wealthiest portion of the population, and on them devolves the whole weight of the annual ' Saliyaneh/ amounting to about 2,000/., the Mahomedans being exempted from it. The ' Kishlak parah-si/ or the sum paid by the various Kurd tribes in the Pashalik of Mush for winter quarters to the Seraskier of Arzrum, is an arbitrary tax, depending on the disposition of the Seraskier. The villages of the plain of Mush are, as before observed, all inhabited by Armenians, but beyond the limits of the plain there are both Kurd and Armenian peasants, sometimes mixed in the same, and sometimes each inhabiting separate villages; however, throughout the Pashalik, the Armenian peasantry exceed in number the Mahomedan; setting aside the tent dwelling tribes. There are few articles produced in the neighbourhood of M^ush which would be lit for exportation to Europe. The principal products are grain and tobacco, but a large number of horses, horned cattle, and sheep, are disposed of, principally, of course, by the Kurd tribes; dealers come to buy sheep and drive them for sale into Syria, as well as to Constantinople. Some gum, tragacanth, and gall-nuts are brought forMUS—NAH sale to Mfish, but they are produced elsewhere. Cotton cloth of a coarse kind is manufactured for the use of the country, and cloths arc brought from Aleppo for the consumption of the inhabitants ; a very few European manufactures are used, and those to a very limited extent, for in general the people are too poor to purchase any but the commonest articles. Ihe plain of Mush may be called a fine one, being nearly 40 miles in length, and from 12 to 14 miles in its greatest breadth; it is watered by numerous streams, but in some parts it is stony and arid. It is said to contain upwards of 100 villages, each having from 20 to 40 fami lies ; there are some few which have more. The climate is less rigo rous than that of Arznim, as much snow, perhaps, falls, but the cold is not so severe; the summer is warmer; indeed, it is often sultry. Grapes are o-rown in vineyards on the side of hills, and a great abundance of melons are produced; there is no scarcity of any kind of common fruits. The only trees to be seen are a few planted around the villages: the recesses of the mountain range on the south are said to have oak forests, but the trees are small. There are several varieties of the oak; one produces the gall-nut, and another manna: the latter is a saccharine secretion which does not possess any medicinal quality, or any peculiar flavour. It is collected by suspending the branches with the leaves on until they are quite dry ; they are then shaken, the manna falls off, and is purified by boiling and skim ming off the pieces of broken leaves and any extraneous matter: this manna is used for making sweetmeats instead of sugar. It is very uncertain product, and is often for a succession of years not to be found in sufficient quantity to be worth collecting: dry seasons are in geneial favour able, wet, the contrary. {Brant—Follingtoti—(Hascoil Dickson.)

It is salt, 255256 NAH—NAK and in the winter months, when swollen by the torrents of the Hamrln range, is of considerable size. (Jones.) NAHRVAN—Lat. Long. Elev. An old canal of the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which left the Tigris on its left bank from Kantara el Resas, and is supposed to have flowed parallel to the Tigris as far as Kut al Amara, and, according to some, to the River Kerkha itself. {Chesney?) NAJAF—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Irak Arabl, Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, 30 miles south west of Hillah. It is situate on a hill at the bottom of which is an artificial lake. It is well built, defended by a good wall, deep ditch, and lofy towers lately renewed. It is said to be the burying place of Ali, and the tomb and mosque fill an ample space in the middle of the city. It is a handsome structure encircled by a high wall. The dome is light and elegant, and toge ther with the tips of the minarets was gilded by the order and at the ex pense of Nadir Shah. The Governor is a Turk, but the population, which it is impossible to estimate from the constant influx of pilgrims, is chiefly com posed of Persian fanatics. The environs of the town are arid and barren, and derive a sombre appearance from the number of burying grounds. It was formerly supplied with water by a subterraneous aqueduct connected with the cut of Pallacopas, but the WahabT in order to distress the city broke down and otherwise destroyed this aqueduct in many places. {Kinnier}. NAKHSHVAN—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Russian Armenia, a few miles from the left bank of the Aras, 260 miles south-south east of Tiflis, 100 miles south-east of Erivan, 95 miles north-north-west of Tab re z. It contains 5,000 inhabitants, and is the chief place of a district bearing the same name, and its population is increasing. The town although long in ruins is still on the decline, particularly since the building of Abbass-abad* It is built upon a hill which overlooks the plain of the Aras and enjoys a fine climate and good water. It contains the tomb of Noah, which is situated in an Armenian burial ground close under the crumbling walls of the fort, overlooking a mile or two of beautiful gardens with tall poplars and many other trees. The tomb is a simple white plastered square brick building about eight feet high with a dome in the centre. There is an inscription in Georgian, which tells that it was restored in 1822, at the corners are niches for burning tapers and be hind it is an ancient looking room where prayers are read when a corpse is interred. {Morier.) NAKHSHVAN—Lat. 39° to 40° Long. 45 o 10' to 46 o 30' Elev. A district of Russian Armenia. It has the limestone hills of Ksrabagh to the north-east, on the south and south-east is the river Aras, and on the north west is Erivan. The district of Crd-abad forms the south-east extremity, and is separated from the other portion by the chain of Dar Dagh. It has the shape of a triang-le, touching the Aras, and the crest of the mountains of KarSbagh at the south-east point; and it contains about 396 square miles of surface. It is altogether the best climate of the trans-Caucasian pro vinces, and is so fertile that it has been called the earthly paradise. Besides the Aras, it is watered by the Ghllan chai, the Ostukan chai, and three other small rivers.NAK—NER There are five divisions constituted by the valleys of rrd-ahad, Alis, Dastine, Tchalanape, and Believe; the first of which contains the capital, Crd-5bad, and eig-ht villag-es. The inhabitants of the district are principally occupied with the care of silk-worms, with their orchards and vineyards, and with a limited cultivation of wheat, Indian corn, flax, and hemp. In cluding- fourteen villages, tha population amounts to 3,883 Tartars, and 1,806 Armenians of both sexes. Three-fourths of the surface of Nakhshvan is mountainous, and the re mainder slopes towards the left bank of the Aras. The principal rivers, in addition to the last, are the Arpah chai, the Nakhshvan-chai, and the Alindja-chai. The climate is good in the higher grounds, but the plains are unhealthy. The wild and domestic animals are nearly the same as in Karabagh. The vegetable productions are wheat, barley, cotton, millet, &amp;c., with an abundance of fruit and forest trees. The minerals are lead, silver, alum, copperas, and an abundance of salt. The province contains the frmr magals of Nakhchivan, Alindjine, Khoi, and Daralaghez. On the left bank of the Aras stands the modern fortress of Abbas-abad. There are in the four magals, and in the different villages of the district, 10,854 Armenians, 12,951 Tartars, with about '2,000 gipsies and other nomadic tribes. [Chesney.) NAOKAR—Lat. Long. Elev.

The rocks around are limestone, and the ground rough and stony, but wherever cultivation is practicable there the laud is sown. The climate is by no means severe, the summer is hot but tempered by a con stant breeze, the winter is short aud much snow does not fall nor does it lie long on the ground. Abundance of melons and grapes are grown here. [Brant.) N1JNI AKHTMSKAI—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Georgia, Russia, 35 miles from Erivan on the road to the Gok- cha Lake.

A village in the province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, 120 miles north-west of Musal, 45 miles south-east of Mardin. It is situated near the ruins of the celebrated ancient fortress of Nisibis, of which, however, little is still re maining. The adjacent country particularly that on the side of Musal has a pleasing, as well as flourishing appearance, and the numberless villages which over spread the plain being almost wholly built on little conical hills bear a strik ing resemblance to feudal castles. In 1838 Ilafiz Pasha attempted to renovate this ancient city. A village was founded, protection with some immunities were offered to its inhabit ants, barracks and a f Khan' were erected, and a large farm established, but after the defeat of the Turks by the Egyptians at Nizib in 1839 it was allow ed to go to ruin again, and I do not know whether anything has been since done to improve it again.

A town, capital of the province of the same name, Asiatic Turkey, situated 45 miles east-north-east of Blr and 90 miles south-west from Diarbakr, on the banks of the Kara Koyi. The town is built upon two hills and on a valley between them, and is surrounded by a stone wall three to four miles ii&gt; circuit and defended by a citadel. 1 he ditch, which is broad and deep, is hewn out of the rock, and, when necessary, can be filled with uater from the River Scirtus. The streets are narrow, but paved and comparatively clean; the bazars and Khans are numerous, and there are a few excellent caravanserais. The houses are well built, and the inhabitants, who aie composed of Turks, Arabs, Armenians, Jews, and Nestorians, are said to amount to about260 ORF—OSS 50,000 souls, of which 2,000 are Christians and 500 Jews. The Chief orna ments of the city are a magnificent mosque, consecrated to Abraham, and the Cathedral of the Armenians, now fallen to decay. On a mountain, which overlooks and commands the citadel, are the ruins of a building-, called by the Arabs the palace of Nimrod^ and several extraordinary subter raneous apartments, apparently of great antiquity. The town has manufactures of coarse woollen and cotton cloths. The Pashalic of Orfa is almost entirely encircled by the windings of the Kuphrates, and the River Khabur occupies a considerable portion of the most barren part of Mesopotamia. It touches on the north and east the Pashalic of Diarbakr and the dependencies of Malatia, and on the south and west it is separated by the Eupharates from the deserts of Syria. The country to the south of the parallel of Soverick is, for the most part, flat, sandy, and uncultivated, and inhabited by tribes of wandering Arabs, who pitch their tents on the banks of the rivers and in the vicinity of the springs. From Soverick to Diarbakr it is more mountainous and better inhabited. Jn the early ages of the Roman Empire this division of Mesopotamia bore the name of Osrhoene, and had subsisted eight hundred and forty—three years as an independent kingdom, when it was reduced into the form of a province by Caracella, who led Abgarus, the last of its Kings, in chains to Rome. It was taken from the Emperor Heraclius by Yezd, the General of the Saracens; seized, during the first crusade, by Baldwin, brother to Godfrey of Bouillon, and erected into a Christian principality, under one of the branches of the illustrious house of Courtney, who were expelled by Zingi, the Atabeg A.D. 1145. It was included in the Empire of Salahuldm and subsequently conquered by the Turks. The capital of the country was called Edessa by the sucessors of Alexander, from a city of the same name in Macedonia; it is afterwards mentioned under the appellation of Rhoa and is at present denominated Orfa, being probably a corruption of its former name. [Kinnier—Ainsworth—Polling ton—Imperial Gazetteer?) ORTAH KHAN—Lac. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Baghdad, 15 miles from Baghdad on the road to Kirmanshah. It only consists of a caravanserai surrounded by a few mud huts, with no cultivation near it. {'I'aylor^ OSSETIANS— A tribe of the Caucasus who inhabit both sides of those mountains, bounded north by Kabarda and Tchetchenia, east by Lesgistan and Kakhetia, south by Kartelinia, and west by Immeretia. That part of the country which is occupied by the Ossetians is distinguished by features which are strongly marked, and it is covered with beech wood, interspersed with walnut trees. It has no towns, but there are numerous villages, eaeh containing from 50 to 60 families, who live in roughly-built houses with flat roofs which rest upon substantial beams. As these villages are not enclosed, and each has in fact only the protection of one or two square towers, the defence of that part of the Ossetian country, as well as of the other districts which are still independent, is maintained by a number of separate but simple and effective entrenchments. Each of these temporary fortresses consists of an enclosure formed by two rows of wattle work placed four feet apart and raised higher than a man's head; earth is tightly rammed between the rows261 OSS and the wall is loopholed throughout. Over the inner circle thus formed is placed a straw roof, beneath which the peasants preserve their seed corn as well as their agricultural and other indispensable implements. Monteith says the Ossetians number 20,000 families, and that those dwell ing near the Circassians are Pagans, the others being Christians. Chesney says they live in 261 villages, with 2,600 houses, inhabited by 16,380 souls. Wagner has the following remarks regarding these people:—The Osse tians have retained no knowledge or memory of the age when their ancestors migrated from other countries to the Caucasian Mountains. Their first conversion to Christianity is attributed to Clueen Thamar, whose armies are reported to have brought into the Caucasus the crosses, whereof the effigy is often seen on the rocks. The Russians made many efforts, after the occupation of Georgia, to win back to Christianity the Ossetians who had long since relapsed into Paganism. This was easily accomplished with a people indifferent about religious matters, especially as a linen shirt and a silver cross were given to every Ossetian who underwent baptism. The pious zeal of the new converts was greatly excited by these means, and there was no end to the number of neophytes who aspired to the right of baptism; till at length it came to pass that one immersion was not reckoned sufficient, and that many Ossetians, in order to become genuine Christians, and at the same time to become the owners of a respectable amount of linen, received the holy sacrament live or six times following. The Russian Government has for some time installed priests of the Russo- Greek Church in Ossetia. According to the notion of these priests, it consti tutes a deadly sin to eat meat, or any animal produce, such as milk, eggs, &amp;c., during their long fasts, and they have begun to preach fasting to their new flocks, but the Ossetian men were scandalized at this. The Ossetians belong to the great Indo-Germanic race, at least, all the learned who have studied their language most attentively agree in this opinion. Dubois and Sjogren appear to have accomplished the most in this respect, although their researches are as yet very defective. The dress of this people is in no respect different from that of the Circassians. Like them, they have the slender form and light, magnificent carriage, but in beauty and energetic expression of countenance, they are generally inferior to the Circassians, as well as the rest of the Caucasians, with the exception, perhaps, of the Lesghis, amongst whom there are a great number of ugly individuals. Their skin is less dark than that of the Tchet- chens; their hair and beards not so black as those of the Circassians. One of the earlier travellers in the Caucasus, says, the Ossetians are all fair; no individuals with black hair are to be seen amongst them. This is essentially false—most of the Ossetians have dark, if not coal black hair. There are many individuals who have brown and red hair, but there are few genuine blondes. The following copious and interesting remarks regarding the Ossetians are extracted from Van Haxthausen who has paid more attention to them than others :—' The houses of the Ossetians are all arranged on the same plan. First, there is an open hall, with a threshing floor on one side, upon which the corn is trodden out by oxen, not threshed by a machine, as amongst the Georgians. There is something quite German in this custom of having the threshing floor inside the house; with all the other Caucasian tribes, it is in the open air in or near the villages. From the hall you enter a large dwelling room, terminating in a kind of wooden chimney, with a square262 OSS aperture in the roof. The hearth is placed beneath this opening- upon the ground, between two large stones over it, fastened to a cross-beam is an iron hook from which hangs a kettle, precisely similar to those in the pea sants' cottages of Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The stalls for the milch- cows are on each side of the dwelling-room, that they may be under the eye of the mistress, who, as in Westphalia, can overlook them from the fireplace. 1 here are no windows in the houses, only small square openings. The wooden chair assigned to the head of the family is always placed beside the hearth; it is either three-legged, with a round back carved and ornamented, or stands upon four legs connected by cross-pieces, which form a back and arms. Against the walls stand three-legged benches, which, when-required for use, are brought to the fire-place beside the arm-chair; these are, however, only for the men; the women, including even the mistress almost invariably seat themselves on the floor. The Ossetes never sit cross- like the orientals, but always upon chairs, benches, or blocks of wood, i hey have also low three-legged tables, not seen amongst any of the other Caucasian tribes, who even at their meals merely spread a carpet on the ground. Iron fire-shovels and tongs may be seen on the hearth, and a roasting-spit with four long forks resting on a three-legged stand. Also a kneading-trough, hollowed out of the trunk of a tree, and a churn, resembling those used in the north of Germany, are used. When the churn is used it is placed obliquely upon a rocking-stand of wood and shaken about till the butter is ready. Butter made from cream in this way is not found among any of the other Caucasian tribes, nor even among the Kussians, whose butter is merely a sort of grease prepared from the cream. Cradles, quite different from those in other parts of the Caucasus, but similar in form to Luropean ones may also be seen. The Ossetes are, the only Caucasians who have bedsteads; these are frequently placed in a niche, and, together with the beds, bolsters and coverlets, exactly resemble those we have in Europe. Even in Russia the peasants stretch themselves out on the stone, a bench, or the ground, where they spread out their pillow and coverlet; whilst in the houses of the nobility, in the interior of the country, bedsteads are unknown; the beds are laid at night upon sofas and removed in the morning. On shelves fastened to the wall beside the hearth are placed the cooking utensils of copper and iron, with vessels of wood, glass, and even earthen ware, which is purchased at Tiills; all are bright and clean, showing the pride taken in them by the Ossetian housewife. The Ossetes, like the Ger mans, brew beer from barley and give it the same name; the other Cauca sians hardly know of its existence; even the Russians have only the quas, a sort of drink resembling beer. They use drinking horns like those of the Georgians, and, to my astonishment, wooden beer cans, and on particular occasions wooden beakers, exactly like those used from time immemorial in Germany. Their festive customs likewise have quite a German character. The beaker, fresh filled with beer, is passed from one guest to another; and after each has quaffed, he says, ' I drink to your good health !' While one is drinking, the rest sing an ancient drinking' song, accompanied by a clap ping of hands :— ' Banas ! na kuchta faresti: Denoason fameste: Banas ! Banas ! Banas !' the word banas! being repeated until the person sets down the beaker.OSS Among the aoricultural implements, the plough seems quite different in construction from all others among the Caucasians; it resembles the Mecklen burg hoeing-plough. The farms in the highest mountain districts are even now quite like castles, whilst those in the valleys are mere log-houses. Those on the hills are built of stone, and surrounded by a wall, with a lofty tower in the centre, three stories high : the lowest story is assigned to the cattle; in the middle one, which is reached by a staircase on the outside, reside the family; and in the top story are kept the stores. At the very top a watchman is placed, who announces all strangers, friends or foes. The walls of these buildings are remarkably compact and firm, although no mortar or cement is used in their construction. In the court-yard there are several houses, and invariably one set apart for guests. The remarkable similarity between the customs of the Ossetes and the Germans has been observed by travellers. Were some German traveller to visit the Ossetes, reside among them, study their habits and customs, and collect their traditions, the results would probably be of great interest and throw light on the early history of the Germanic race. The Ossetes call themselves Ir and Iron, and their country Ironistan. By the Circassians they are called Kash'ha; by the Tatars, Oss and Tauli; by the Lesgis, Otz, Otze; by the Georgians, Ossi. The Ossetes have very obscure traditions of the origin, migration, and history of their race. They say that their ancestors came originally over the mountains from the north; that they at first dwelt in the country now occupied by the Circassians, and had been driven onward as far as their present territory by other races pressing behind. This vague tradition has certainly historical probability. The Georgian annals assert that the Ossetes came from the banks of the Don, and Ptolemy mentions them as living at the mouth of that river. Ihey are said to have built Azof. In the Ossetian language Don means water'' or ' stream,' and countless rivers have this affix. The Ossetes, who are clearly the same people as the Alani, formerly inhabited also the slopes and plains of the Caucasus, and were governed by their own Kings; but in the fourteenth century they were driven out and forced to retire to the mountains. They have possessed their present territory from an early date, since the Georgian annals mention them as their neighbours so long ago as the time of Alexander the Great. The maiority of the Ossetes are nominally Christians and belong to the Greek Church; but there are some dwelling on the Circassian frontier who are Mahamadans. Neither Christianity nor Mahamadamsm however, appears to make much impression on them; they are in fact semi-pagans indeed some are wholly and avowedly heathens. Ihey offer sacrifices of bread and flesh upon altars in sacred groves; of these the most famous is in the interior of the country, not far from the village of Lamadon; it was originated by the Nards, an extinct tribe, supposed to have been Jews. 1 he cave of the Prophet Elijah (Asiljalegat), the guardian and patron of the Ossetes, is in this grove. . n a The Christian Ossetes likewise frequently present sacrifices and tha offerings, consisting chiefly of flesh, fish, and bread on ancient altars in caves and sacred groves, and sometimes on large artificial mounds of stones Before the caves of Elijah (for there are scveral that iust .oentioned being the most celebrated), goats are slam, and their skins hun 0 upo 263264 OSS lofty trees. The Christian festivals are religiously observed when saerifiees ai e offered. At Ji,aster a sheep is killed; the flesh is handed round by the oldest person present, while a prayer is recited; the bones and skin are then burned. Different sacrifices are appointed for all the great festivals: on New Year's Day a pig- is slain, at Easter a sheep or lamb, at Michaelmas an ox, at Christmas a g'oat. r l here are four Saints to whom particular veneration is paid,—the Prophet Elijah, the Archang-el Michael, St. Gregory, and St. Nicholas. On the first day of the week, called Chatzawibon (Lord's Day,) and on the seventh, called Shabate, the Ossetes wear no covering 1 upon their heads; they do not, however, disting'uish these days by any strictly religious observances. Monday and Friday they consider unpropitious for entering- upon an undertaking', a superstition which also exists widely in Europe. These customs exhibit a singular mixture of Christianity and Judaism : if the tradition be correct that the Nards were Jews, the introduction of many of these prac tices may be attributed to them. Superstition appears to abound among the Ossetes, in proportion as Chris tianity has become obscured. They have fortune-tellers, witches and magicians, who profess to foretell the future by means of visions and conversations with the souls of holy men who are dead. Open robbery is not considered theft; but if anything has been secretly stolen, its owner applies to a sorcerer (Kurismezok, wise man), and by means of a present secures his assistance. The Ossetes hold the graves of their ancestors in great reverence. Many families have hereditary burial places and vaults in common. The corpse is always laid with the head toward the west; large stones are heaped over the graves of those who are buried singly, and a square stone, usually six to eight feet high, is erected at the head. Funerals are generally conducted with great solemnities. At the interment the wife and saddle-horse of the deceased are led round the grave three times, as a sign that they were his most individual property, and that they cannot pass into other hands. From that time the horse must never be mounted by another rider and the wife cannot marry again. Persons struck by lightning are considered sacred and are buried on the spot where they died, amidst universal rejoicing and shouts of ' O Elai, eldar Tschoppe ! ' (O Elijah, lord of the rocky mountain !). It is supposed that the Prophet Elijah has taken them immediately to himself. The grave becomes a resort of pilgrims, and a black goat-skin is hung beside it, similar to those in front of the caves of Elijah. The following marriage customs are observed by the Ossetes. The father of the suitor, or, if he is not living, some elderly relative, goes to the parents of the girl and informs them of the young man's wish. If they consent the girl is asked ; if she does not consent, the matter is at an end; but if her answer should be in the affirmative, the bridegroom makes his appearance with ins father, and wooes for himself; and the price agreed upon, consisting generally of cattle and arms, is handed over to the father or brother of the bride. On the day of marriage the bridegroom appears with a train of relatives and friends at the house of the bride, where a banquet is prepared; the following day the feast takes place at the house of the next neighbour, and so on through the village, and until this ceremony is ended the bride groom cannot take his bride home. The bride is conducted by the relatives; when she reaches the door all the boys of the village pinch and push herOSS aljout but she must not defend herself nor utter a sound. The husband who has meanwhile gone before, receives her at the door with a burning heart hand To T g ' 7 ^ is then Ied three times round the \ fit placed on a raised seat m front of it.

A woman who has borne children cannot, after the ohll.A ^ bu8baild ^ ma rry again out of the family; she has been pur ged and is their property. The father or brother of the deceased may hj; . .'f' wblcb indeed the Ossetes consider a matter of duty, a point of is indissolubl 00 U ^ 0U ^ as a con tinuation of the first marriage which 265 Ik266 OSS The children of the second marriage rank as children of the first, and inherit the name and property in the same manner. r ihis idea is carried out still further. If the deceased husband has left no brother or father sur viving^ and the widow is thus obliged to remain unmarried, she is not on that account prevented from living with other men, and any childien v vhich may result from such connexions are considered the legitimate onspring ot the first marriage. ' , Great courtesy prevails in social life among the Ossetes. ihe more suitors a girl has, the more she is respected and the higher her price rises ; a o-irl who has not at least one, or a widow who has not several, is so despised as to be publicly spat upon. The wife generally rules paramount in her own house, and the hushand is in most cases decidedly henpecked. But it must be mentioned, to the credit of the women, that they are remaikably industrious: they cut the hay and corn, carry the grain to the mill, bring wood home on their backs from the forest, and many of them even plough and manage all the tillage. On the death of the husband his widow has the entire management of the household, until his son has grown up; she then resigns it and is honorably supported by him. If the widow has no children and declines to marry again, the property remains in her possession, and at her death passes to the male branch of her husband s family. The eldest son attains his majority and assumes the management as soon as he can mow grass with a scythe. Brothers generally remain together on the same estate and share the produce. At the death of the father his eldest son receives a horse or cow or ten sheep, with the paternal mansion; and the youngest, if unmarried, receives a present of arms and cattle, to enable him to purchase a wife : the property is then equally divided among all the sons. The daughters receive nothing, but are sold for the benefit or the estate. The basis of the social and political state of the Ossetes consists, not in a feeling of nationality, but in their family clanship. This bond exists, how ever, only among relatives of the male line and bearing the same name. Relationship on the mothers side is not recognized. The Ossetes are divided into three classes,—nobles, freeman and slaves. The nobles enjoy great honorary privileges, but no political superiority or territorial dominion. The Georgian annals speak of seven noble families after whom the Ossetes named their rocky valleys. When they were driven from the plains into the mountains, one of these families, the Sidumom, was mentioned to me as flourishing at the present day. In northern Ossetia tiiere is a peculiar class of nobles, consisting of twelve large families, said to be descended from Tagoar (the crown bearer), an Armenian Prince: they have the hereditary title and office of village elders, a position similar to that of the Armenian village elders. The Ossetian nobles attach great import ance to purity of blood. If a noble marries a girl of the second class, or freeman, his children are degraded to the third or slave class. The nobles in the north are Mahamadans and intermarry principally with Circassian nobles. Among the pagan Ossetians there are a few priestly families who are said to preserve certain idolatrous relics. Among the Ossetes the slaves are treated as members of the family. The nobles have peasants under them, who rent the land and are tieenienj they also hire farm-laborers and male and female servants, and Ossetian female servants may be seen at Tiflis. The Georgian girls never enter service,267 OSS nor any of the Mahamadans, who consider it a reproach to a freewoman to serve for hire, although female slaves are not uncommon among- them. The custom and law of blood revenge prevails among both nobles and freemen ; and it is remarkable that there are also courts of arbitration and expiation, precisely like those which formerly existed in Germany. If a murder be committed, any relative of the victim is entitled, and indeed obliged, to take reveng-e and slay the murderer or one of his family; this accomplished, he g-oes to the grave of his kinsman and exclaims, ' 1 have revenged thy blood and slain thy murderer In cases of murder or manslaughter, the injured party is always at liberty to refuse any offer of atonement and to demand blood-revenge. Frequently, however, especially in recent times, the case is referred to a court of arbitra tion, in which it is customary to tax the wounds of a man who has been killed, at twice the amount for those of one who has recovered, the rate being in proportion to the rank of the family. Compensation for wounds and injuries which are not fatal is fixed by these courts. Formerly it was a prevalent custom for a murderer to pay a fixed price for a certain time to the family of the murdered man, say for a year, during which time the blood- revenge remained dormant. In these courts of arbitration, each party chooses three heads of families, not related either to the accused or the accuser, and these six select a seventh as a foreman. r lhe court first requires a solemn declaration from both par ties that they will submit to its decision, and demands three sureties on each side. A post is then fixed firmly in the ground, as a symbolical sign that the disputants must abide by their agreement, a curse being invoked upon all who neglect to fulfil it. Each party now presents its version of the matter; the court then retires for deliberation to a place appointed for the purpose, generally in a forest. When the judges have agreed upon a decision, they communicate it to both parties. The body of every Ossetian has a settled value in the eyes of the judges, whieh is fixed by public opinion. The father of a family bears a higher value than an unmarried man, and a noble is rated at twice as much as a freeman. Every limb is taxed in the same manner. Gaping wounds are measured by barleycorns; a wound is said to be so many barleycorns long; its length is declared by the court, which imposes a penalty of one cow for each barley corn ; so that the infliction of a wound sometimes involves a fine of ten or twelve cows. 'Ihe judges, however, frequently declare the wound to be much shorter than it really is, being guided in their decision by its severity and the degree of danger attending it. The cow is the unit of valuation among the Ossetes, as it was among the Romans and ancient Germans. They say a thing is worth so many cows, or fractions of a cow; the ox is reckoned as two cows. The Ossetes, however, have for a long time been used to stamped coin; and in the districts bordering on Georgia a cow J s worth expresses a regular equi valent in money. A cow is equal to one rouble banco. The first is probably the value adopted in judicial decisions, and the second the price current. The expiatory penalties awarded by the arbitrators are not estimated solely by their worth in cows; but as money is extremely scarce, sometimes by other objects, such as swords, guns, &amp;c., which are generally rated very high, often at twice or thrice their actual value.268 OSS The maximum of compensation for murder or homicide has been fixed from time immemorial, whether by the King- or by a national decree, is not known. The murder of a freeman who is not a householder is rated at nine times nine cows; that of a head of one of the principal families at eighteen times eighteen cows; but the court of arbitration diminishes the penalty according to circumstances. In cases of injuries and wounds which are not fatal, popular custom requires every one to submit to the decision of a court of arbitration; but as there is no direct law to enforce this, persons who are powerful enough frequently refuse to pay the appointed compensation. The aggrieved person then takes the law into his own hands and attempts to wound his adversary in return. If the retaliation does not exceed the original injury, the affair terminates; but if the wound given is greater than the one received, the feud begins afresh from the other side. For homicide a mode of expiation by ordeal is sometimes adopted, especially if the perpetrator of the act be poor. The latter is required by the injured family to stand to be shot at by one of their number. The form of proceeding is regulated by the court of arbitration, which orders lots to be drawn by all the marksmen of the family, even the mere boys, appoint the time and place, and measures the distance. One shot is sufficient, whether it hit or miss, whether the wound be mortal or slight, and the affair ends here. Disputes relating to property are also decided by courts of arbitration. Where open robbery has been committed outside a village, the court merely requires the stolen article, or an equivalent, to be restored; but in cases of secret theft, five times the value must be paid. Robbery and theft within the boundaries of a village are rated much higher. A proverb says, ' what a man finds on the high road is God's gift;' and in fact highway robbery is hardly considered a crime. When the court has come to' a decision, and before pronouncing sentence, it requires each party to cut a notch in a staff of limewood, as a sign of their submission to its decision. When atone ment has been made, the offender is expected to invite the injured man and his family to a feast; acceptance of the invitation stands for a receipt in full: if the banquet is not offered, the aggrieved party may claim a fresh compensation. The judges receive, as a remuneration for their trouble, a present from each party, generally one-twentieth of the property in dispute. The laws of hospitality are strictly observed by the Ossetes. The host considers himself responsible for the safety of his guest, and revenges the murder or wounding of the latter as he would that of a kinsman. Indeed the duties of hospitality are held so sacred, that if an Ossetian receives into his house a stranger, whom he afterwards discovers to be a man to whom he owes blood-revenge, this makes no difference in his hospitality to him; but when the guest takes his leave, the host accompanies him to the boundary of the village, and on parting from him exclaims, ' Henceforth beware! I am your enemy.' In those districts sloping down to the plains, agriculture is the chief occupation of the people. A three-years' course is adopted ;—the first year the soil is manured and wheat sown, the second year barley, and the third the land lies fallow. Rye is little cultivated and oats still more rarely. Here and there the small Caucasian millet, called galma, and in gardens maize, cucumbers, peas and beans may be observed. Corn is reaped with a small269 OSS Bickle, and grass mown with a scythe. On the mountains agriculture is less practised; the inhabitants depend chiefly for subsistence on the rearing of cattle, sheep, and goats, of which immense herds are every where seen; they have also excellent horses, of the Circassian breed. Among the Ossetes hay- cutting is one of the most important labours of the year, whilst the Georgians scarcely know the use of hay. Almost all the field work, except mowing the grass, is performed by the women. The men mostly devote themselves to hunting, pillage, and gallantry ; when at home, they employ themselves in re pairing saddles, harness, shoes, &amp;c., and in carpenter's, mason's, and smith's work. The physiognomy, figure, and whole outward appearance of the Ossetes form a perfect contrast to the surrounding Caucasian tribes, especially the Georgians, who are characterized by a tall slender figure, a noble bearing, regular features, aquiline nose, finely formed mouth, dark complexion, black eyes and hair, in short, exhibiting the truest type of form and beauty. The Ossetes, on the other hand, are short and thickset, being rarely above five feet four inches in height, and have broad haggard features, usually blue eyes, and red or light-brown hair. The women are seldom pretty; they are short, stoutly built, and mostly flat-nosed. Kohl mentions the extra ordinarily small and well-formed feet of the Ossetes. The women and girls are nimble in their gait, but the men have the heavy tread of the German peasant. The bread eaten by the Ossetes is made of wheat or barley, unleavened and baked in the ashes. They boil their meat, and thus obtain soup, which is unknown to the Georgians, who usually roast their meat on wooden spits. The Ossetes do not roast either beef, mutton, or goat flesh, but only game and poultry. The similarity of some of their dishes to those common in Germany has already been remarked upon. Two classes of national costume may be observed among all the Caucasian tribes, the Circassian and Persian. The Ossetes have adopted the former, but it does not sit on them as prettily as on the graceful Circassians. They are, however, very clean, wearing their hair short and cut quite round; they also shave off the beard, but many have moustaches. They bestow great care upon their weapons, some of which are of great antiquity; the frequent letters, Latin inscriptions, and coats-of-arms, upon the sabres and gun barrels evidently point to the time when the Genoese were masters of the Black Sea. The Ossetes show the greatest love and veneration to their parents, to old age generally, and especially to the memory of their ancestors. The authority of the head of the family, whether grandfather, father, step-father, uncle, or elder brother, is submitted to unconditionally; the young men never sit in his presence, nor speak with a loud voice, nor contradict him. It is a curious fact that the Ossetes alone, of all the Caucasian tribes, take off their cap or touch it in the European fashion, as a mark of respect (the women, if seated, merely stand up), and sometimes kiss the hand of the father, the person of rank, &amp;c. A parricide draws upon himself a fearful popular revenge; he is shut up in his house, with all his possessions, surrounded by the populace, and is burned alive. The reverence for their ancestors is remarkable; they consider no oath more sacred or binding than swearing by the graves of their forefathers. If a man has received injury from another, and can obtain justice by no other means, he generally brings hisOSS injurer to reason by threatening to disturb the ancestors of the latter in their graves. At the head of each villag-e is an elder, ehcttd or hereditary who is also willingly obeyed; he is the arbitrator in minor disputes, and the leader in feuds and warlike expeditions. The language spoken by the Ossetes, according to the celebrated Russian philologist Sjorn, belongs to the Indo-Gerrnanic stem; at the same time it is an independent language, and more nearly allied to the Persian than to ie (jerman, resembling the Finnish in the use of postpositions ; it has no prepositions. Although the Ossetian language does not bear any near affinity to the (jerman, yet in its tones and cadence it so strikingly resembles the latter as spoken m the north of Germany, that on hearing it at a little distance, one seems as if listening to the conversation of Saxon peasants. Compared with all the other Caucasian tribes, the enunciation of the Ossetes is slow which increases this illusion. The Ossetian singing is European in its character; whilst that of the Georgians and Armenians, the two most cultivated Caucasian races, is utter ed m tones which our notes cannot convey ; it can only be imitated upon violin, as our gamut is not adapted to it, and their notes sound to our ears inharmonious and out of tune. With the Ossetes it is quite different : their songs possess the decided melody and regular cadence of our common' scale. Ihese are m alternate singing : one person sings the melody, whilst the other lolds on tlie key-note, producing an effect by no means unpleasant or inhar- monious. The second then sings a verse, and the first sustains the key-note. 1 he conviction, says \ an Haxthausen, was forced upon me, as upon many preceding travellers, that there must have existed, in very early times a near relationship between the Ossetes and the ancient Germans; but history is silent, and affords us no means of solving the enigma. The sac-red legends give obscure intimations that the European races originated and enugrated from the Caucasian countries lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea. A mythological tradition of the Scandinavian Germans says, that the later divine race of the Asoe emigrated hence with their people northward; but the accredited story informs us that in the great wanderings of the Teutonic races, especially the Goths, these people migrated north to the foot of the Caucasus, established themselves there, tounded a powerful kingdom, from which they were afterwards expelled by pastern races, the Huns, and driven toward the west. The only certain fact is that some of them remained in these parts. Many of the Goths settled m the mountains of the Crimea, and traces of them existed there until a recent period. It is indeed possible that a branch of this Teutonic race may have settled permanently among the mountains of the Caucasus. To which of these causes can we ascribe the similarity of institutions and the intermingling of blood between the Germans and Ossetes ? If the latter were the original race from which the Germans descended, a greater alhmty would exist between their languages, whereas, in fact, the Ossetian is more nearly allied to the Persian. It may perhaps be said that the Ger man, Persian, and Ussetian are sister languages, deriving their origin from the same Indo-Germanic stem, from which they blanched out simulta neously. Ihe emigration of the Asoe, the second source of consanguinity seems too mythical and obscure to build upon. The accidental similarity ot names, such as Ossen, Aisen, who are said to have founded Azof on 270OSS—PAN the Moeotis, proves no connection with the northern Asce. Moreover, the Ossetes call themselves by the name Ir and Iron; the name Ossetes, is only given them by other nations. The third conjecture is, that the Ossetes are descendants of the Goths or other Germanic tribes allied with them. Here again the entire difference of language would appear to raise a radical objection, liut it was a peculiarity of the Germanic emigrating tribes that in their new homes they firmly adhered to their old judicial institutions and habits, their social and domestic customs and modes of life, which they imparted to the people they subjugated. At the same time, in mingling with the conquered race, they thus formed a new people, preserving all the habits and customs, both legal and social of the mother country, whilst they lost their own language, retaining merely a slight similarity of construction and a few German words. It was the same with the Franks and liurgundians in Gaul, the Goths and \ andals in Spain, the Lombards in Italy, and the Normans in Gaul and Italy. Is it not possible that some tribes of the Goths may have wandered or been driven into the Caucasus, have fallen upon the original race of the Ossetes or Alani, conquered, mingled with them, and thus formed a new race? Ihc language of the conquerors may have disappeared, but the German blood, physiognomy, characteristics, institutions, habits, and social customs may have been so perfectly engrafted and adopted by the conquered country, that no European can travel through it without instantly observing their Ger man origin.

It is placed high up the mountains under a lotty peak crowned by an old castle. The Euphrates is here very rapid and about 100 yards wide. It is not considered safe to pass over the bridge below the town on horseback, as the buttresses which are the only remains of an ancient structure, have been united with wood roughly and by no means solidly put together. The height of the bridge is 2,819 feet. From the town up the stream the channel is compressed into a narrow space by mountains rising abruptlv from its banks. In some parts its breadth does not exceed 30 yards in others it is three times as much. There is a ford below the town, but from the numerous turns it takes it requires a perfect knowledge of the ford to enable a person to cross it without risk.

At low tide there is a small island at the rivers mouth, which makes an apology for a delta. Ships lie about half a mile from shore, and can have no communication with it if the weather be at all rough, but if it be fine, a pigmy steamer comes out to unload them.

A river of Adana, Asiatic Turkey, which falls into the Mediterranean. It is navigable for small steamers to Misis and Ainzai bah. R. RABAN HORMAZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A convent in the Pashalic of Musal, Asiatic Turkey, 45 miles north of Musal. ' The monks are dusky looking men, clothed in the coarsest manner, like peasants, but more sombre in their colours; their gown being of a dark blue or black canvas, with a common Abba or Arab cloak of brown woollen over it. On their heads they wear a small skull-cap of brown felt, with a black handkerchief tied round it. The priests are rather better clothed, in black dresses, with black turbans on their heads. The monks are of all trades,—weavers, tailors, smiths, carpenters and masons; so that the wants of the convent are entirely supplied by the convent itself. Their wants ara indeed very few, the order being that of St. Anthony and very rigorous in its observances. The monks never eat meat, except at Christmas and Easter. Sometimes, indeed, if any of their friends bring them a little as a present, they are not forbidden to eat it, but no meat is provided for the convent. 'I he daily food is some boiled wheat and bread, and even this in small quan tities. Wine and spirits are altogether prohibited, and none but the trea surer is allowed to touch money. ' The monks live separately and alone in their cells when not employed at their work, and are forbidden to talk to one another. A bell summons them to Church several times a day, besides which they meet in the Church at midnight for prayer, again at day-break, and at sun-set, when they each retire to their cells without fire or candle. Some of these cells are far from the others, in very lonely situations, high up the mountains, in steep places, and look difficult to get at by day—how much more so in dark and stormy nights! They are surrounded by wild plundering tribes of Kurds, who might come down and murder them in their different retreats, without their cries for help being heard; but their poverty preserves them from such attacks. Young men among them retire here, when weary of the world and hoping to find rest in this solitude and acceptance with God, through religious exer cises of a painful and mortifying nature.'

The people are a mixture of Ossetians, Georgians, and Armenians, differing little, except in language from the Imeretians. They have alternately been under thecon- tiol of the Chief of Imeretia and of tlie Vali of Georgia, but have always been considered a distinct people ruled by their own Chief.

A tribe ol Kurds who inhabit the vicinity of Ravandiz in Kurdistan. It is a very large tribe numbering with its dependencies 12,000 families. It is divided into 12 Mains or branches, of which the following are the names :—Mamgird, Mamasam, Marnsal, Mamies, Mamseki, Manu Khal, Mambal, Mamkekal, Mamsiel, Mamuli, Pubal, Kelu. I here are also a great number of dependent tribes, which, although not originally of the same stock as the Ravandiz, have long been associated with them and now generally assume their name. The following are the piincipal: Shekhab, Milibas, Nurik, Henarai, KheilanI, Kasan, Shekh Mahmudl, Bamami, Derijhki, Sekui, Hubui, Shikilti, Mendik, Plrajhi, Baimar, containing seven minor divisions. (Hawlinson.) RAVANDIZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kurdistan which rises on the west slope of the Kendilan Moun tains. Is ear Ravandiz it enters into a ravine of limestone and receives at the town a stream from the south; not far from Ravandiz is a gap in these cliffs to the south, through which flow the winter torrents from a high mountain towering over these ravines, and named Sar Hasan Beg. Further on and about one mile below Ravandiz, the river of that town is joined by a much larger stream. (Amsworth.) RAVANDIZ—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Kurdistan about 100 miles east of Musal. It consists of About 2,000 poor houses with a sort of fort situated in the hollow of the mountains in the south bank of the Greater Zab, over which there is a bridge of trees resting on two stone piers and covered with branches and earth. Ihe Mir of Ravandiz had under him formerly the whole country from Ushnai to the ligris and as far south as the Lesser Zab. The inhabitants of277 RAV—RED Ravandlz are for tlie most part Ravandis. The fort of Ravandiz has been the strong place of Sohran Chiefs from their first establishment in the mountains. The town is situated on south bank of the Great Zab. It occupies a narrow valley under the Beni Henderln hills, and is protected by a very strong- fort which is built on a little bay on the acclivity of the moun tain. Ravandiz is situated midway on the mountains between the plains of Assyria and Media, at the distance of about 15 or 16 hours from either. Ainsworth says the number of houses is only 1,300; but most of them con tain from two to three families; none so few as one and many more. The houses are built in rows one above the other and descending on successive tiers along a tongue of limestone which has a deep ravine to the east and another to the north, the latter containing the River of Ravandiz. The roofs of the houses have no walls. The town is excessively crowded. It is defended on the land side by a wall with round towers, and the Bey has several guns. There are also several round towers outside the town; on the opposite side of the east ravine there are two; between the castle to the north and the ravine of the river there are two more and two in advance of the walls on the land side. There is also a larger tower in the town on the higher part of the rock. {Rawlinsoii—Ainsworth.) RAYAT—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Kurdistan, 18 hours south of Ushnai, the capital of the Baleki Kurds. {B.aiolinson.) REDUT KALA—Lat. 42° 16' Long. Elev. A fort on the coast of Mingrelia, ei^ht miles north of Poti on the Black Sea. It was at one time the principal Russian station on this part of the Black Sea. It stands at the mouth of the Khopi. The river is not more than 30 yards broad, but has twenty feet of water within, except on the bar where it varies with the floods, or more properly with the wind, from four to seven feet. The bar is of sand and of no great extent. The Khopi has 18 feet of water for 40 miles and the current is scarcely perceptible; it consequently overflows the town and surrounding country which is an absolute marsh duimg the greater part of the year. The climate is very unhealthy and the Russians generally lose one-fifth of their men per annum. Abich gives the following tables descriptive of the climate of this place :— Temp.

The aspect of this place is very singular, lying on the river Khopi, which is here navigable for ships at its mouth. A row of houses stand supported behind on piles in the water, and the vessels sail directly up to the wooden balconies which run along- this side. Trees and bushes are scattered among the buildings, and the external aspect of the place is quite that of a Dutch village, except that the neatness and elee-ance of the latter must not be looked for in the interior of these O dwellings. Wagner remarks regarding this place—The town resemtues a uerman fair, consisting of two interminable rows of wooden barracks, not much278 RED—RIO Idig'ci 01 convenient tlian the I'rsinkfort fmr Ijootlis l)uilt on piles^ raised a foot above the ground. Even the public buildings and ofiicial residences are of wood. Notwithstanding the dampness of the climate and the multi tude of woodworms, which destroy a wooden house in a few years, this material has the preference. This results from the great-abundance of timber in the immediate vicinity, whereas not a rock is to be seen throughout the fertile, but humid, soil of Mingrelia. Ihe erection of the houses on piles is a necessary precaution in this extremely damp region. So damp and insecure is the foundation of the wooden barracks, comprising Rednt-Kala, that after a few days' rain the passenger would be exposed to stick fast in the streets, were they not strewn with a deep bed of shingles. ihe roadstead of liedQt-Xala, which does not deserve the name, is one of the worst along the Caucasian shore, being exposed to the full force of the west and southerly gales, whilst the anchoring ground is unsafe for shipping, even in a slight storm. The river Khopi, which bisects Rednt-Kala and flows into the Black Sea close by, has a tolerable depth of water, and would be navigable for vessels of considerable tonnage, if it were n(5t choked with a sand-bar, like all Colchian streams. The expense of its removal would be somewhat heavy, and as the bar can only be passed by boats drawing three feet of water, all vessels that put in at this port make all haste to land their cargo and escape into the offing. Redut-Kala has never been a town according to European ideas, never theless it enjoyed considerable prosperity after the Russian occupation, during the space of ten years, owing to a ukase, which secured free trade to the Trans-Caucasian Provinces during that interval. This stimulated the exertions of the Armenian merchants and secured a considerable transit trade from Leipzig, through Georgia to Erivan, Tabriz and Persia. Hence Redut-Kala became suddenly the greatest emporium on the east coast of the Black Sea. Speculators, shipowners, and trading adventurers, of all races and classes flocked into the place, which grew as though by magic, and the value of the imports amounted at length to two million silver roubles annually. The returns consisted chiefly of home produce, maize, dried fruits, tobacco, skins, wax, fruit, and excellent timber, which found a ready market at Odessa, in fact, the whole country was enlivened and improved by the passage of the numerous caravans. Unhappily this state of things ceased in 1831, notwithstanding the protests of the interested and the provident. The Moscow merchants and other short-sighted persons thought to secure a fortune by monopoly and protection of Russian goods, and that trade could be forced to follow any course that might be chosen. Hence, in 183^ free-trade was abolished, the Persian traffic passed to Arzrum and Tarabizun, enriching the Greek speculators of Stambul and the English manufacturers; Redut-Kala became deserted, and the Moscow traders were disappointed. At a more iccent d l ite, 1 nnce A\ oronzoff raised his powerful voice in favour of a removal of the prohibition system, but it is probably too late. {Ahich— Van Haxthausen—Monteith—Wagner?) RION—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Imeretia which rises in the main range of the Caucasus. It first flows north to near Orbeli, then south past Kutais to the junction of279 RIO the Quirilla, and from wliieh point it turns due west and falls into the Black Sea at Poti. It is extremely rapid, and flows in so oblique a direction, that in a short space it was said to have been traversed by upwards of one hundred bridges. It becomes navig-able and placid 'when it reaches the town of Sarpena, according to Kinneir, but Monteith says it is only navigable to Mehrand for vessels drawing 18 feet water; a bar with only 6 feet preventing their proceeding higher up. But this must be when the river is in flood as Eastwick did not get higher than 15 miles in the dry season. The river is closed by a bar, and though deep for a distance of 50 miles, has never afforded any facilities for navigation. There is a narrow creek which unites with the Rion some miles above Poti. The Rion is only navigable as far as Merani; beyond this place it becomes a rocky torrent, down which the timber of an inferior quality, produced in the very neighbourhood, can with difficulty be floated. It is a mistake to suppose the trade of Asia was ever carried by the Rion and the Kiir; it was probably in former days, as at present, by caravans, the various points to which they proceeded being at the distance of 300 miles from the navigable parts of these rivers. The Quirilla branch perhaps contains more water than the Rion. At Kutais the Rion is about 30 yards broad, but not navigable from rocks and other obstructions. On the piers of an ancient bridge the Russians have placed a wooden arch. Monteith ascended the Rion some distance to look at the gold mines, but only found some shafts and furnaces with some signs of copper. If gold ever existed, it must have been on the Quirilla, not on the Rion. These two rivers form at the Georgian Castle of Swertziche, 12 miles below Kutais, from which they take the name of Phasis or Rion, and are then navigable for boats at all seasons : from this to the sea the river has no obstructions, it is generally from 20 to 30 feet deep, and the current about 2^ miles an hour. The countiy appears perfectly level in many places; the banks are higher than the surrounding country. Their appearance would lead to the supposition that the river was formerly confined by embankments. Three miles below Merani the Rion is joined by the Itskhem Itskale, the largest of all its tributaries. The Rion is navigable from this point for boats of 60 tons, and might, except for the bar at its mouth, where there are only 6 feet of water, be so for the largest vessels. Twelve miles below the junction there is a large island where the Russians have a naval port, magazines, &amp;c. The north branch of the Rion is shallow and is only used by small boats. The south branch has always six and sometimes 10 feet on the bar. The island which is formed at the mouth of the Rion extends very little into the sea and is of small extent. Twelve miles from the mouth there are two considerable islands in the river; at 26 miles further the mouth of the Tekown coming from north-north-east, and at 14 miles beyond the Russian station of Kodori, four miles from which the Khems Kair joins from south ; 35° east. At 11 miles further is another small island, and at nine miles further still the Pelchou joins from south 75° west, whence it is two miles to the military station of Merani. [Kinnier—Monteith—Eastwick.) RIZAH.—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of TarSbizun, Asiatic Turkey. It is an important and fertile district, with the most extensive bazaar on the coast. The climate is milder than on other parts ; oranges and lemons are produced in the open air, shelter for the trees not being required in the winter months as it is at Tarabizun. Rizah is famous for the manufacture of a linen made from hemp, used throughout Turkey for shirts. {Brant.)280 RUM—SAK RI M KALA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Or fa, Asiatic Turkey, on the rig-ht bank of the Euphrates, 26 miles above Bir. It is a small town and fort, inhabited by Turks and Arabs. The fort which gives its name to the place is a castellated building on a high hill of limestone formation, overhanging the right bank, and having its base washed by an abundant stream which enter the Euphrates from the west through a very rocky valley. Along the tributary and on the right side of the hill rising from the main trunk, stand the town which may contain 900 miserable houses covering the sides of the hills, encircling that on which the castle is so judiciously placed. This was the great passage of the Roman armies into Mesopotamia. [Kinnier—Chesney.) S. SADAT KHAN KALA—Lat. Long. Elev.

[Jones—Rich.) SAGDIDI—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in Mingrelia about 35 miles north-east of Redut Kalah, 55 miles north-west of Kutais. It stands in a lovely and fertile situation, and was the ancient capital of Mingrelia. [Imperial Gazetteer.) SAICH— A tribe of Bedviin Arabs who inhabit the north part of the Province of Baghdad, in the vicinity of Nislbin. They number 500 tents, and are subject to the Shamr to whom they pay tribute. [Taylor?) SAKLAWIA—Lat. Long. Elev. A canal in the province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, which leaves the Euphrates, above Felnjah, and 5f miles north, 60° west from it, and crosses Mesopotamia by a tortuous eastern course on the north side of Akar Kuf, and enters the Tigris at a point five miles below Baghdad; but, until altered by Daud Pasha, to avoid the danger of inundations, it joined the Tigris a little above the city. The distance from river to river (by the course of the Euphrates steamer in passing, under Lieutenant Lynch, in 1838) is about 45 miles. The remains of a bridge at its commencement, as well as the geographical position, leave little doubt that this is the Tsa canal, which, according to Abu-l-feda, was so great that large boats sailed upon it fromSAK Bat&gt;-li(lacl to the Euphrates. Elsewhere the same author says, that it sepa rates from the Euphrates near Anbar, and goes from thence to join the Tigris above Baghdad. This cut (he adds) was called after Tsa, a descend ant from the family of Xhaliph A1 Mansur; and was excavated, says Edrisi, in order thus to reach Baerhdad. Dr. Winchester who went through it on the Euphrates Steamer gives the following particulars regarding it:— ' The entrance to the canal is about forty feet, with a current of nearly four miles an hour. Its banks are low and flat, covered with the liquorice plant, growing to the height of ten feet, often with a root four and five inches thick, excluding, save a few tamarisk bushes and long grasses, every other vegetation. The banks of the Saklawia are steep and not elevated above the level flat of the surrounding plain after the few first miles of the canal, nay, they are frequently lower, a fact which proves, with the general appearance throughout, that the greater part of it is a natural and not an artificial canal. In the plain the remains of several old canals are seen in the distance, whose banks are often elevated forty or fifty feet, and present a gravellv appearance. No similar elvation occurs in the Saklawia; on the contrary/where the liquorice and tamarisk cease, the surrounding flat of grass is equal and unraised in any one spot, a tract often unbounded, on which numerous herds feed in the vicinity of the black tents of the nomad races who inhabit them. The canal which is about seventy miles long, is very narrow and tortuous during its first two-thirds; in its last it becomes straighter and often as broad as fifty yards, with banks flanked by high reeds, with a stem several (from thx'ee to five) inches in diameter, and in height not less than twenty feet. In the vicinity of Baghdad the Sakla-wia enters a large lake, which contracts in a canal called the Mosada, previous to entering the Tigris five miles below. ' The navigation of this canal was accomplished in four days in the follow ing manner:—The steamer entered the Saklawia stern foremost and she slowly passed down the numerous and abrupt windings of the stream, aided by native trackers, frequently grounding on the steep bank, but by the aid of poles and ropes which the trackers held uniformly got off, without any great damage, though at the expense of considerable delay. Ihe stream in force was not less than four miles an hour during the whole of the first day's progress, and its turnings, often at right angles, were most numerous for about eight miles, when they diminished, so that the steamer was able to go on with precaution ahead. Still she frequently came upon the bank, striking so hard and fast, that hawsers attached to anchors fixed on the opposite bank were required before she could be placed in the centre of the channel again. The second day's progress was equally tedious, the vessel slowly and not without constantly striking from one bank to the other, sometimes stern first, sometimes broadside down the current, and seldom in her proper position, got down the canal about five miles, when she grounded on a shoal bank, from which, after five hours' hard and unremitted exertion, she was bodily hove off. Scarcely, however, was she rid of this bank, than again grounding, the steamer remained fast during the remainder of the day and the night; nor was it until a renewal of labor the following day that she was hove off into the stream; shortly afterwads again to ground. On the fourth day she grounded as she passed the remains of an old bridge at the entrance of the Mosada, by which the steamer proceeded into the Tigris.' ( Che&amp;ney— Winchester) 281 1M282 SAL—SAM S ALIEN.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Russian district of Talish on the rig-lit bank of the KQr river, near its mouth. It is more correctly speaking a collection of villages which owe their prosperity to the fishery carried on by the Russians. It was once an opulent city. {Kinnier.) SALM.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of Kurdistan which rises in the neighbourhood of SfilimSnia, and flows south-east to join the Tarud eight miles above its junction with the Diala. {Chesney). SAMARA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, on the left bank of the Tigris, 74 miles from Baghdad. The modern Samara consists of about 250 houses with 1,000 souls, built in the midst of the ruins of the ancient town, round the tombs of two of the Imams and the hole in the ground where the 12th and last disappeared. These are held very sacred by all Mahamadans, but especially by the Shia sect; and the principal revenue of the place is derived from Persian pilgrims resorting to these shrines. The natives, however, are all Sunis and remark able for civility and freedom from bigotry. They could hardly raise amongst them 100 stands-of-arms. The soil is a cement of pebbles on a bed of limes as hard as a solid rock affording but little vegetation, and the climate is celebrated for its salubrity. This town has a strong wall, built at the expense of some influential Shias of India. The two tombs are those of the Imam Hiisen Askari, which has white dome, and of Imam Mehdi, which has a very neat cupola, beautifully enamelled with yellow and white flowers in a bluish green ground. Imam Mehdi, the last of the Imams, is said to have disappeared at this spot, and it is believed he will at some future date again appear in the same place. At least 10,000 pilgrims annually repair to this sacred spot. The town is farmed by Government for 280,000 Riego piastres or 660 pounds sterling. Outside the town is a brick work 'madarseh,' which measures 200 by 150 yards, and has a high' wall supported by buttresses. Outside this is a barbarous but curious looking cork-screw tower, a spiral dividing it into six towers. It is 163 feet high. {Ross—Jones—Kinnier—Rich.) SAMUKHA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Georgia, Russia, 30 miles north north-east of Ganja, on right bank of the Kiir. One of the divisions of the Ganja district takes its name from this place. [Chesney.) SAMdKHA.—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Sinjar hills in the Provinceof Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, about 12 miles east south-east of the Lake of KhatQnia. It has the largest popu lation of any village in these hills ; it consists of 130 houses or about 1,000 persons; its fig gardens extend close to Sifri, a distance of 4^ miles and also a great way up the sides of the mountain. There is no spring nor stream near it, but abundance of water is always procurable from wells dug in and near the village. {Forbes.) SAMUR.—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the district of Shirvan, Georgia, Russia, which rises in Lesgistan and falls into the Caspian by innumerable mouths south of Darband. It is not above three feet in depth, but exceeds 300 in breadth, and it is worthy of283 SAM—SAR remark that the waters of this river increase in the day and diminish in the night, probably from the melting of the snow on the mountains. [Kinneir.) SAPAN TAGH.—Lat. Long. Elev. about 10,000. A mountain in the Province of Van, Asiatic Turkey, about 40 miles north west of Van on the north of the lake. It is bare and treeless, and is apparently of volcanic nature. It is a spur direct from Mount Ararat, and runs east and west on the north of the lake, dividing the drainage of the Morad Chai from it. It is continued in the Nimrud Tagh. It is covered with snow nearly all the year round. The specimens of rock which Brant collected on it prove beyond a doubt the volcanic nature of the mountain, but there is no record or tradition of its having been in a state of activity. Sapan means holy and is one of the epithets applied to the Deity. Sipandagh is a splendid mountain but inferior to Ararat; it perhaps nearly equals Demavand and Savalanin elevation; in appearance it exceeds them, but this may be owing to the absence of other mountains of great height; in shape it resembles a truncated one. Snow lies on it to the middle of July and it is only practicable from the middle of August to the first week in September. (Brant.—Shiel. Imperial Gazetteer?) SAPHAR—Lat. Long. Elev. A monastery in the Russian district of Akhalzik, Government of Georgia, Russia, 10 miles south-east of Akhalzik. It is magnificently situated in the centre of a crescent-shaped curve in the mountains between Si, 000 and 3,000 feet above the plain. The precincts of the far-famed monastery of Saphar are entered by a stone portal, from which a strong wall, 150 yards long, leads up to the main building. Between it and the precipice on the far side of it is a slip of ground, perhaps 200 yards broad. On each side is a square stone build ing, with a trap-door in the centre, leading down a great distance. These were secret ways of access and egress, known only to the monks, and by no means free from danger even to their practised feet. At the back of the principal building is a row of fine Saxon-looking arches, well carved and with a long Greek or Georgian inscription. On the reverse side is a foun tain of beautiful water. The view down to the plain is magnificent. For a long space there is a tableau of the tops of hills, ridges, and peaks, and beyond these the river; while farther still, huge dark mountains shut in the view. (Eastwick.) SARAMSC—Lat. Long. Elev. A river of the Province Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, which rises in the Darkush Dagh, 10 miles north of Peychar, 30 miles north-west of Neyki, and joins the Batman Su at the village of Darakol; its bed is very broad but the stream is divided into many channels. [Brant—Imperial Gazetteer—Taylor.) SARD ARAB AD—Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Russian Armenia, 30 miles west of Erivan, on the banks of a canal. It is a large fortified place and is surrounded by a rampart of rough stone only, cemented with clay and with bastions at short intervals, and no ditch. It was besieged by General Paskivitz in the Russo-Persian war of 1826. The Russians commenced operations by throwing a quantity of shells into the village,—a mode of proceeding which merely destroyed some of the stores that would later have fallen into their hands, besides expending much valuable ammunition. The walls, however, soon began to give way, and the splinters from the stone did more execution than the shut. After284 SAR a few days the garrison, principally MazandarSnl and Arab irregulars, attempted to leave the place, but nearly 2,000 of them were killed by the Russian Cavalry, though their Commander, Husen Khan, about the worst officer that could have been entrusted with such a duty, succeeded in escaping to his brother the Sirdar, and General Paskiewitch was enabled to lay immediate siege to Erivan. {Monteith.)

SARMENA—Lat. Long. Elev. A village on the coast of the Province of Tarabiziin, Asiatic Turkey, 20 miles east of Tarabiznn at the mouth of the Kara Dara. It stands on a limestone height and consists of houses built of stone, but diminutive both in size and height. The shops chiefly kept by Greeks are very iudifEerently supplied, the chief articles being woollen and cotton cloth, tobacco and groceries. The exports consist of wine, oil and fruit. Its population is about 2,000 souls. (Brant.) SAROCHEK—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Turkish Kurdistan, north of Sulimania. [Rich.) SAR SARA—Lat. Long. Elev.

A mountain ridge in Turkish Kurdistan, Asiatic Turkey, which lies to the north of Sulimania between the Sival and Tengazi rivers. [Rich.) SART.—Lat. Long. Elev. A town in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, on the right bank of Sart Sa, 90 miles east of Diarbakr. It is a mean and wretched Kurdish town situated at one end of a large undulating plain without a single tree on the slope of some highland separating it from the Bohtan Su or East Tigris, from which it is two miles distant at the nearest part. The plain is considerably higher than the bed of the river, the descent to it being over a very steep road about one and a half mile long. The quantity of cultivation in the vicinity of the city is great, particularly of melons and cucumbers; in the midst of each field there is a small stone-house, well loop-holed for the protection of the property. There are at least twenty of these edifices in the neighbourhood of Sart, which give it the appearance of being surrounded by a number of small forts. The town is about two miles and a half in circuit, inclosed by a wall of stone and lime, with round and square bastions, but destroyed in many places and without any ditch. A great part of the space inside the wall has no buildings,285 SAR—SHA and the city is said not to contain nore than 1,000 houses of Kurds, Arme nians, and Nestorians. There are three large mosques and several small ones, two churches, five baths, and one caravanserai. The Governors House is a large building sunk in a deep moat, which can be filled with water ; this castle has bastions and loopholes in abundance. The houses are arched and built of stone, with very thick walls; but this does not diminish the heat of the interior. The city of Amadia is said to be forty-eight hours south-east from Sart. From Sart to Bitlis there are the three roads of sixteen, eighteen, and twenty hours respectively. Besides this, there is a road of thirty-eight hours to Mush direct, which does not pass through Bitlis. {Imperial Gazetteer—Taylor—Shiel.) SASCN.—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of the Kurdish Mountains, in the Province of Diarbakr, Asiatic Turkey, north-east of Diarbakr. It is inhabited by a warlike unruly set of Kurds called Baliki. Hiizu is the chief village in it. (Imperial Gazetteer— Taylor.) SAVANLI DAGH.—Lat. Long. Elev. 5,500 A range of hills between Kars and Arzrum, Asiatic Turkey. From the ex tremity of the plain of Kars the ascent of this range commences. It is covered •with forests of Scotch fir. It would be easy to make a carriage road across this mountain range, which is traversed during the summer by carts used for the transport of goods between Kars and Arzrum. The ascent is long and gradual; the descent is short and rapid, and ends on the Aras flowing through the plain of Pasin. The forests of the Savanli Dagh supply Kars, Arzrum and the villages in the plain of Pasin with timber for building and firewood. See Soganlu. (Brant.) SEKKIR.— A tribe of Kurds. See Kurdistan.

SHAHMCHI—Lat. Long. Elev. A town, the capital of the Province of Shirvan, Georgia, Russia, situated on the bank of the Aksu, 210 miles east-south-east of lifiis, and 7U miles west of Baku. _&gt; It occupies some elevated ground nearly in the centre of Shirvan Propei and it contains a population of about 11,000 souls, who are partly leisiaus and Armenians, but chiefly Tartars. The Russians, after their capture of the city, re-constructed it on a regular plan, and now it includes the usual propoi - tion of bazaars, caravanserais, baths, and Churches, in addition to 2,233 houses partly within its fortifications. It was a place of great commercial importance and so extensive that previous to the great earthquake of 117(5 it contained 40,000 houses.286 SUA Old Shahmachi, the former capital, is situated about 70 miles inland of Baku, and for its trade, wealth and population, was, after Ispahan, ranked among the most flourishing cities of Persia. To punish a rebellion which the inhabitants had raised against the Government of Nadir Shah this city was razed and depopulated; but that the empire might not be deprived of a mart, so happily placed for foreign commerce, that prince formed about ten miles to the south-west of the old city a new Shahmachi. An extensive trade of silk formerly was maintained between Shahmachi and the Elack Sea, through which channel large quantities of that commodity were imported into Turkey and thence into Europe. This trade, though still existing, is much diminished since the llussians, by obtaining the dominion of the Caspian, have made a monopoly of the Persian silk.

It is peopled by about 4,000 Turks and Jaf Kurds and is on the whole a handsome little town, watered by two canals from the Diala. It is now falling to decay; the greater part of its walls and houses are in a ruined state, but a wet ditch still surrounds the place on three sides. The houses are covered with nests of storks which give them a very extra ordinary appearance. The district all round is very fertile and its cultivators now form almost the only inhabitants of this village. The village is strongly situated on high ground and has withstood many sieges in former years.— {Kinnier—Taylor?) SHAIIR-I-ZOR.—Lat. Long. Elev. A plain of Kurdistan south-east of Sulimania.

A tribe of Arabs who inhabit the Province of Baghdad, Asiatic Turkey, extending all over North Mesopotamia from south of Sin jar and the Khabur to the Saklavia, west of Baghdad and even to the Shatt-al-Hai, Shamr and the Tai, who are dependent upon the Shamr now, although they formerly were the real owners of the pasturages. It is only 70 years ago that the Shamr, under Fares ibn Umr ibn Mahamad ibn Abdiil AzTz, first came from Nejd and occupied the country; which now is sometimes called by them Jazirat ibn Fares. It is hardly necessary to say that they pay no tribute whatever to the Turkish Government; on the contrary, their head men receive a monthly salary from the Turks, and levy, in addition, black mail from every traveller and caravan passing through their territory, and also from all the villages and towns in the plains subject to them. They are the curse of the country, and have totally put a stop to everything like cul tivation and improvement in the splendid tracts they call their own. They are the terror of the Turkish authorities and people; they live entirely in the desert tracts, or rather, tracts where they appear to have become deserted, and as caprice or fancied neglects on the part of the authorities seize them, they issue forth on plundering excursions, carrying oif everything far and near, even to the gates of the cities. Unable to drive them away, the Turkish Government has consented to pay their Chief a monthly salary to secure his allegiance, or, in other terms, to buy the forbearance of the tribe. This, however, serves only a purpose, and, as the Chief says, is not sufficient to purchase coffee for his hourly recurring guests. A sort of hollow peace is, however, patched up by the contract, and comparative quiet, broken only by occasional reports of petty plunderings, exists for a time. They are useful to Government only under general rebellion of the minor Arab tribes, when they are called upon to fall on them with fire and sword, and are prompt enough generally in availing themselves of the permission. They sweep the country on these occasions. Friends and foes of authority are indiscriminately visited, and though there is not much bloodshed there is universal wreck. The tribes hasten to get out of their way, and so quick are Beduin movements, that they succeed only in escaping from them with their families. Flocks, tents, household furniture, crops and kine are abandoned and fall into Beduin hands, to be driven off and sold at the lowest possible price to any who will pay them in ready money. Plunder being their only object, they care not to pursue the proprietors, for they have no real sympathy with the Government in these affairs. The divisions of the Shamr are as follows :— Asadan numbering 300 tents, residing from Kut to MehdT. Debuneh to Zeljeh. Zeljeh to Dokhaleh. Dokhala to Kethiyeh. Kethiyeh to Taj. Daur. Daur to Alaj.

This tribe has been much divided of late^ owing to intestine quarrels. It is said to have been originally a branch of the Beduin tribe, Sharamar Jerbeh; but having settled, as it were, into agricultural and pastoral habits, it lost its independence and was degraded; Togha, the affix of the original name, having been given them to mark this event and to separate them still further from the proud race of the other name. It signifies a necklace, ' or badge of slavery.' They have about 200 matchlocks or guns, and can bring about 700 horsemen into the field. Their war-cry is ' Sinaaish.' They possess much cattle.

SHAMSADIL.—Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Georgia, Russia, lying west of Ganja. It contains about 1,247 square miles of surface, with a population of 19,599 souls, 3,944 Armenians, and the rest 15,655 Tartars. It has 50 villages, with 2,561 houses. The district of Shamsadil is inhabited by Armenians and Tartars, the former dwelling in the mountains and the Tartars, who are the majority, in the fertile plains. The Armenians are principally engaged in agriculture, gardening and the culture of the vine; they grow wheat, barley, millet, maize, and occasionally a little flax. The Tartars are more occupied with breeding cattle, horses and sheep than with argriculture; they are for the most part well-off, but lazy, whereas the Armenians are extremely industrious. The Tartars inhabit large villages, of one to three hundred houses; the villages of the Armenians are in general small, never comprising more than a hundred dwellings. The Tartar houses resemble those of the Georgians, and it seems not improbable that the one people imitated this style of build ing from the other. These dwellings might be called subterranean caverns; they lie open to the road and are unenclosed. In the Crown villages the land is the property of the sovereign; but the buildings, trees, vines, &amp;c.,289 SUA belong- to the peasants. To each house there is properly attached a certain portion of land; peasants however frequently dispose of this by exchange, sale and purchase, but only among 1 members of the same commune. Among the Tartars, upon the death of a father, his sons inherit the pro perty in common, and frequently continue to live together; they are, how ever, at liberty to divide the property, under the direction of the Sharrah, or Spiritual Court, among the Sun! Mahamadans, by the Kazl; and among the Shia sect, by the Akhund: there is here only one Akhund over fifty villages. The Sharrah makes the division equitably; the most indus trious of the brothers receiving the house, and the others land, money, or cattle. The daughters receive nothing but some of the furnitures and carpets : should there be no sons, the daughters have the inheritance. If the father has during life shared the property with his brothers, his daughter or daughters receive all; but if he has held the house and property in common with his brother until the time of his death, the daughter gets no portion of the land, but receives from the Sharrah her share of the other property. The Tartars have a hereditary nobility, entitled Begs, of whom almost every village has a family. The Begs had formerly jurisdiction in civil cases, together with the collection of the Crown taxes. Every farm-house have to give the Beg one day's ploughing, one day's harvesting, and one day's threshing, together with horses when travelling; but these dues have been commuted for a sum of money. The common people have a great veneration for the old Beg families, but this feeling does not at all extend to the new Begs, who have probably received their title from a commission in the Russian service. The Crown claims the landed property of the Begs, although this claim apparently amounts merely to a kind of suzerainty. The Begs dispose of their land without restriction and pay no taxes. Since the year 1841 there have been established in the Tartar villages, as in Russia, Starsheenas (a Persian word, signifying ' Village gods;' and besides these from two to five elders of the commune (Kampa or Aksakal, literally 'rt re y heads') : these retain their office for life, unless they resign or are deposed for misconduct. The Starsheenas and elders are elected by the commune, the choice of the former being confirmed by the ^Manorial Chamber. At the present day the Starsheena levies the Crown taxes, for which the whole district is answerable. The share of each village is also fixed, subject to the same condition; a certain tax is laid upon every hearth, and the value of the tithe of corn is taken in money. The rates for the maintenance of the prisons, hospitals, roads, and bridges, together with the supply of horses for the post and military service, also create an oppressive burden. Among the Armenians questions of inheritance are settled by arbitration, regulated by the same laws and customs as prevail in Georgia. They have here likewise a class of nobles called Meliks or Begs, who have no privileges, receive nothing from the commune or the Crown, and possess no serfs; they are, however, tax-free, like Tartar Begs. The Crown lays claim to the lands which they hold, but here too the claim is merely nominal; their title alone distinguishes them from the Tar khans, or families of freemen. In all other respects the political state of the Armenians here is similar to that of the Tartars. The Tartars and Armenians manufacture carpets and shawls and are fond of trade. A man's daily wasres in summer are half a rouble, and in winter290 SUA twenty kopecks, besides his food; a farm-servant's annual wages amount to about thirty roubles. There are no female day-laborers, nor hired maid servants, and the women never work in the fields. In this district are likewise the Mountain and Pass of Alaverdi.— [Chesney — Van Haxfhausen.) SHARl N—Lat. Long 1 . Elev. A district of Russian Armenia, bounded by the Aras on the west, Arpachai south, and Sadrek north. It is particularly fertile and produce very abun dant rice crops. It is particularly well watered by the Arpachai.— (Morier.\ SHAT-AL-HAI—Lat. Long*. Elev. A canal which leaves the Tigris nearly opposite the town of Knt-al-Amarah and runs to the Euphrates about 80 miles above Korna. The greater of this branch takes an easterly direction, under the new name of Shat-al-'Amara, till it joins the Frat; whilst the smaller turns off nearly at a right angle towards the heart of Lower Mesopotamia. The lattci branch, or Shat-al-Ilai, has a breadth of nearly 150 yards, and takes a southerly direction to the mounds called Neishaget Wasit, where it forms two branches. One of these, called the Bu-ji-Heirat, follows a circuit ous course by the old fort of Tesaine to Tela Tendhiyah, where it is rejoined by the other branch, called the Shat-al-'Amah, which flows near the modern asit. It is not navigable in this part of its course, but the western is so, and is in consequence the regular passage. These united streams take the direction of south 22- East, under the name of Sab-bil. At about 20 miles below the junction just mentioned the trunk of the Hai sends off a canal, called I3e Dokhan, towards the eastern side, and also another in the opposite direction, to Shatrah, about 11 miles lower. At the tombs of Hamzah the mam stream of the Ilai again divides into two branchesof these, the most northerly, or that which is navigated, enters the Euphrates opposite to the Custom House of Al-^Arkah; and five miles lower, near the village of Abu Sof, which is 78 miles by the river from Karnah; the smaller branch also falls into the Euphrates, after a course of about 140 miles from Kut al- Amarah. Ihe banks are inhabited, and owing to the inundations and the facilities of irrigation, the country-is easily cultivated at those places. It is navigable during eight months of the year, and at that season the canal is preferred by the boatmen to the passage along the main stream on account of the heavy dues exacted by the Beni Lam Arabs.— {Chesnev,) S H AT-AL- K E H R— Lat.
