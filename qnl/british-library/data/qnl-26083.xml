The Colony of Aden is situated on the south coast of Arabia and is bounded on the seaward side by the Gulf of Aden and on the landward side by the Aden Protectorate. It comprises— {a) the peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased by the Aden Settlement to the Air Ministry for Royal Air Force and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point but more particularly by the names of the spurs of Jebel Shamsan on which the buildings have been constructed, and lastly the dhow harbour and village of Maala; (6) the isthmus known as Khormaksar; (c) an area of land enclosing the modern harbour and extending north and west to the Little Aden peninsula. The villages of Sheikh Othman, Hiswa, Imad and Buraikha and Fakum, the last two on the Little Aden peninsula are situated in this area; (d) the island of Perim.ADEN, 1937 3 Description. The Aden peninsula is high, rocky and of volcanic formation; Jebel Shamsan, its summit, is 1,725 feet (525 m.) high and there are some turreted peaks close to it. The harbour lies westward and north-west of the peninsula. Dwelling-houses and shops are constructed on the ridges of the mountain and in the valleys between them where the ground is normally level. Crater, the main and original town, is situated at a distance of five miles from the modern harbour and lies in the extinct volcano on the east of the peninsula. The isthmus is a flat sandy plain on which has been laid out the aerodrome and lines of the Royal Air Force, the Naval wire less station, the Aden Protectorate Levy lines, and the golf course. Owing to lack of building space at Tawahi, dwelling- houses for senior Government officials have recently been con structed here. It is only 1,320 yards wide at its narrowest point near the peninsula. Cultivation occurs at Sheikh Othman in the form of a large vegetable and fruit garden belonging to the Aden Settlement. There are also privately-owned date palms there. Hiswa has several groves of palms, but with these exceptions there is no regular cultivation in the Settlement. Perim. Perim island, situated in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandab, is bare, rocky, and rather flat in appearance; its highest point, about a mile northward of its southern extremity, is 214 feet (65 m.) high. The surface of the island is grooved with dry watercourses and covered with coarse grass and stunted shrubs, the subsoil being sand and conglomerate coral. Perim harbour and False Bay, a small shoal light, lie on the southern side of the island. Perim was at one time of importance as a coaling station, and also from the Eastern Telegraph Company’s station and Lloyd’s signal station being situated there. Climate. There is a third-class meteorological observatory in Aden under the superintendence of the Medical Officer in charge of the European General Hospital. The maximum day temperature recorded was 100-3 in June, and the minimum was 68-i in December. The rainfall totalled 8 centimetres. Hot sandy winds prevailed as usual during the south-west monsoon. There are no crops in Aden, which depends on supplies from other countries, principally India and the interior. The climate of Aden from October to April, i.e. during the north-west monsoon, is cool and pleasant, especially from November to February. During the south-west monsoon, i.e. from June to September, a hot sandy wind known as Shimal prevails on the peninsula, but on its western side the breezes are 13557 A 2COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL 4 l from seaward and fairly cool. May, a part of June, and Septem ber are generally hot, damp, and airless. Sandstorms occur in the months of May, July and August. These come from a northerly direction usually a short time before sunset and blow very strongly at times up to 10 p.m., the air being so thick with sand that it is only possible to see a short distance, and the temperature falls. During the month of August dense mists occur at times and it is not possible to see across the harbour. Meteorological records are maintained at the European General Hospital and the data are published in the Aden Colony Gazette weekly for the information of the public. History. Aden has been a place of importance historically owing to its possession of the only good harbour situated on the main ocean trade route between Egypt and India and to the fact that it is easily defensible. Prior to the discovery of the Cape route in the fifteenth century, the trade followed much the same course as the main trade route between the East and the West does to-day, i.e. across the Indian Ocean to Aden, thence up the Red Sea and across Egypt to the Mediterranean. From the earliest times the great Empires of the world realized the importance of Aden during this period, and during the time of the Romans at least two endeavours were made by them to capture the Red Sea trade and they sent an unsuccessful expedition against Aden. The discovery of the Cape route at the end of the sixteenth century diverted the major portion of the trade from the old Red Sea route, and in consequence the port of Aden declined. Aden was attacked by the Portuguese in 1513 and 1516, captured by the Turks in 1538 and remained in their hands about 100 years until the Yemen Arabs rebelled and drove them out, Aden thus coming under the Imams of Sana’, who have never renounced their claim to it. In 1728 the Sultan of Lahej, the ruler of the territory adjacent to Aden, revolted and established his indepen dence and included Aden in his Sultanate. The decline of Aden continued until its capture by the British in 1839, when its village consisted of 500 inhabitants. Financial negotiations with the Sultan of Lahej having failed, the plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden resulted in its capture by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy. The latter became the first Resident. The desire to establish coaling stations on trade routes, necessitated by the replacement of sailing ships by steamer, was one of the reasons which led to Aden's occupation by the British. The revival of the Red Sea route and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 regained for Aden its old importance. As a result of the increased prosperity of Aden since British occupation, the population has risen from 500 to 46,000. The modern commercial prosperity© 1 ADEN, 1937 5 of Aden is based on the fact that it is a fuelling station, originally for coal and now for coal and oil. It is nearer than any other large port on the main Eastern trade route to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s production centre in the Persian Gulf. The fact that ships call at Aden for fuelling has caused a general increase in trade, and it is the distributing centre for trade to and from Arabia, Abyssinia, Somaliland and Africa. Perim. The first trace of the occupation of fhe Perim island goes back as far as 1738 when the French landed there, after the bom bardment of Mocha. It was not until the 5th May, 1799, that the British took formal possession, but it is recorded that owing to difficulties in maintaining a supply of water they evacuated the island in the September of that year. Perim was reoccupied in January, 1857, under instructions from Lord Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, to Sir William Coghlan, Political Resident and Commander, Aden, and Lieutenant Templar in the Mahi was deputed to accomplish this reoccupation. The island was then placed under the control of an Assistant to the Political Resident, Aden. The Assistant Resident remained in control until 1929, when the Manager of the Perim Coal Company, Limited, was appointed Government Agent. On the closing down of the Perim Coal Company in October, 1936, the Commissioner of Police, Aden, was appointed Administrator of the island. A police detachment is maintained on the island, and the Administrator makes regular visits generally performing the journey by air. IB.—GOVERNMENT. Previously to the 1st April, 1932, the territory now comprising the Colony was administered by a Resident under the control of the Government of Bombay. From the 1st April, 1932, Aden became a Chief Commissionership, and control was transferred from the Government of Bombay to the Governor-General of India in Council, the Chief Executive Officer being styled Chief Commissioner, Resident and Commander-in-Chief. On the 1st April, 1937, Aden was constituted a Crown Colony and was removed from the control of the Government of India. The Colony is administered by a Governor, who is also Commander- in-Chief, aided by an Executive Council which at present com prises five members. The Council consists of the persons hold ing the offices of Political Secretary and Civil Secretary and such other persons as the Governor, in pursuance of instructions from His Majesty through the Secretary of State may from time to time appoint. At the present time, in addition to the ex- officio members, the Legal Adviser, the Finance Officer, and the Chairman of the Port Trust and Settlement have been appointed to the Council. There is no Legislative Council. 13557 A 36 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL Military Garrison. The Military Garrison of the Colony is under the immediate command of an Air Officer Commanding and consists of Air Headquarters with its various departments, Headquarters Royal Artillery, qth (Minden) Heavy Battery, R.A., 20th (Fortress) Company, R.E., No. 8(B) Squadron, R.A.F., a Section of Armoured Cars and the Aden Protectorate Levies. Air Head quarters, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers and the Section of Armoured Cars are stationed at Tawahi (Steamer Point), while No. 8(B) Squadron, R.A.F. is at Khormaksar and Sheikh Othman. There is a Naval Office (H.M.S. Norfolk III) in charge of the Naval Officer-in-Charge who also exercises general control over the Naval wireless station at Khormaksar. IN.—POPULATION. According to the census of 1931, the total (civilian) population of the Aden Settlement was 45,992. This excludes the military forces and the population of Perim. The following table shows the population distribution by caste and sex: — No. Caste. Se Males. X. Females. 1 Arabs 18,388 10,341 2 Indian Mohammedans 2,829 2,393 3 Somalis 2,070 2,107 4 Hindoos 1,992 622 5 Jews 2,114 2,006 6 Parsis 236 96 7 Native Christians ... 339 207 8 Europeans ... 213 39 Total 28,181 17,811 The total numbers of males and females show a marked disproportion, the males being 28,181 in number, whereas the females are only 17,811. This is due to the fact that most of the Arabs of the trade and coolie class from the interior come to Aden without their women folk. IV.—HEALTH. The staff of the Medical Department in Aden consists of the Senior Medical Officer, one Civil Surgeon, two Resident Medical Officers and eight Assistant Medical Officers. There is a fully- qualified Lady Doctor attached to the Civil Hospital in Crater The Senior Medical Officer is also Port Health Officer and has charge of the European General Hospital. There is also a Medical Officer of Health with an adequate subordinate staff.ADEN, 1937 7 The two Government hospitals are the European General at Steamer Point and the Civil Hospital in Crater. The nursing staff of these institutions is provided for from funds made avail able by the Government of the Colony and the Prince of Wales’s Aden Nursing Association in the proportion of approximately half and half. The Prince of Wales’s Aden Nursing Association is a charitable organization with invested funds raised originally by voluntary subscription, and the Association issue appeals to the public from time to. time to supplement the amount of money available from interest on their investments. Two dispensaries in charge of Assistant Medical Officers at Maala and Sheikh Othman respectively cater for the minor ailments of the local population in these districts and serve as clearing stations for the more serious cases which are transferred to the Civil Hospital. One Assistant Medical Officer is stationed on Perim island, where ffiere is a small dispensary with limited accommodation for in-patients. The Keith Falconer South Arabia Mission have a large and well-equipped hospital at Sheikh Othman staffed normally by two European doctors and a European nursing staff, and other charitable institutions are two dispensaries, one maintained bv public subscription with a Government subsidy and the other supported entirely by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers. The Royal Air Force hospital meets the medical requirements of the British forces in Aden. There are several dentists practising in the Colony, and the Royal Air Force have a fully-qualified dentist, who is permitted private practice. A total of 16,636 out-patients and 2,213 in-patients received treatment during 1937 in the two Government hospitals, and excluding the Royal Air Force hospital, but including the other hospitals and dispensaries, a grand total of 60,069 out-patients and 3,206 in-patients were treated in the Colony. The general health of Aden has remained satisfactory through out the year. There is a pleasing absence of the many insect- borne diseases commonly found in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and although a mild intestinal infection is very common, the more serious disease, such as typhoid fever and the dysenteries are gratifyingly rare. A number of cases of malaria appear in the returns, but all of these are imported from the Protectorate or other places outside the Colony, not one single case having been contracted locally. There is a leprosy hospital at Sheikh Othman, partly sup ported by the Government of Aden and partly by the Aden Settlement funds and administered medically by the staff of the Keith Falconer South Arabia Mission. Here again the Colony of Aden acts as the kind sister of her neighbours, since the great majority of the patients hail from the interior. There has been no epidemic of the major infectious or con tagious diseases during the year. Chickenpox, measles and8 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL mumps occur from time to time and are treated in the infectious diseases hospital on Maala plain. A small lunatic asylum is situated outside the walls of the Civil Hospital and is administered from it. The port health work is a very important feature in the medical and sanitary organization of the Colony. The proximity of Aden by sea to ports which are subject to periodic infections makes the careful inspection of vessels a vital matter, and in addition the services of the Port Health Officer are in constant demand to assist the masters of the many cargo ships carrying no doctor which use the port. Passengers and members of the crew requiring hospital treatment are accommodated in the European General Hospital or, if the illness is an infectious one, in suitable isolation. It is usual to have patients of four or five different nationalities, European and Eastern, in the wards at the same time, which is a compliment to the hospital and indicative of the service it renders to shipping, but tests very thoroughly the linguistic capabilities of the staff. During 1937 2,274 bills of health were issued to mechanically- propelled vessels and 1,222 to native craft. V.—HOUSING. General. Houses in Aden are of stone masonry, except at Sheikh Othman where mostly they are built with sun-dried bricks. In every case particular attention is paid to efficient lighting and ventilation. Each residential quarter is provided with proper sanitary accommodation and kitchen which are suitably detached from the living-rooms by large and open court-yards or by large shafts open to the sky. Most of the houses are provided with floors made of cement- concrete; this is insisted upon in all new proposals, and the height of the houses is never allowed to exceed the width of the streets. Back-to-back houses are not allowed; a few still exist in the village of Maala, but these are being eradicated as opportunity occurs. At the rear of all houses there are open spaces from 5 ft. to 10 ft. wide. They are called sweeper passages, and the sanitary accommodations abut on to these spaces and drain into them. Each such passage is connected with the main drainage system in all divisions of the Settlement except Maala, where it is connected with a big soak-away pit. With these aims every building plan is carefully scrutinized by the Public Health Department before it is allowed to be constructed. Most of the dwelling-houses within the Settlement limits are well ventilated and lighted and are satisfactory from a public health point of view. Endeavours are being made to effect an improvement in the architectural standard of the buildings.9 ADEN, 1937 Water Supply. The water supply is obtained from six bore-wells situated near the village of Sheikh Othman. The supply for the civil popula tion is pumped into two tanks each of 100,000 gallons capacity, and from these tanks the supply gravitates through a 15-in. main to a storage reservoir of 400,000 gallons capacity at the Isthmus. There is a pump-house at the Isthmus, and the water is drawn from the storage reservoir and chlorinated automatically by a venturi-operated chloronome , ’ before being pumped to Crater and Tawahi. Some 2,000 houses have been connected to the main water, and hre hydrants have been sited at intervals throughout the system. There are filling-stations for camel-carts at Crater, Tawahi and Sheikh Othman, and by this means water is distributed to houses which have so far not been connected to the main supply. The water is of exceptional bacteriological purity, although rather hard. VI.—PRODUCTION. Veterinary. Cattle, sheep and goats are imported from British Somaliland, Arabian and Red Sea ports and from the Yemen and Aden Protectorate for consumption in the Colony. As an indication of the quantity imported annually it is of interest to give the figures of imports from the 1st April, 1937, to the 31st December, I 937 - Cattle. Sheep and Goats. From British Somaliland and Arabian and Red Sea ports ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 49,772 The Yemen and the Aden Protectorate ... ... 2,129 6,369 Of the total imports, only 842 sheep and 26 milk cows were re-exported. Rinderpest .—There was an outbreak among the milk cows in November and out of over 100 cows 36 died. The cattle were treated by inoculation, and quarantine restrictions were imposed. Fisheries. The fishing is, generally speaking, good, but the quantity is greatly influenced by the movements of the different species of sardinella on which the large species feed. Shark, barracuda, horse-mackerel, sea-perch, dolphins, the smaller members of the tunny family, rock cod soles, and mullet are the principal edible fish. Sword or sail fish make their appearance at certain seasons of the year but are not easily saleable for human con sumption. Crabs and crawfish are to be had at all seasons, and oysters are available in the winter months. The fishermen are a very industrious people and employ various kinds of nets as well as hand-lines in their work. The nets used are of the stationary, circular throwing, and drag varieties, the latter being used from the shore. In addition a special net is operated from boats working in pairs during the monsoon period. Throwing10 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL nets for mullet, mackerel and a form of whitebait are also in use. The catch is at times greater than the requirements for local consumption, and the surplus is salted for export. Shark is almost invariably salted for export and during some seasons large quantities are dried. Whitebait are exported. The fishermen are subject to certain rules which forbid trawls and limit the size of nets, and in addition they defer to the judgment of their elected Akils in matters of fishing custom. Licences to dive for pearls both in the harbour and in the waters of Perim are obligatory, but no licences are required to fish. Saft. A salt work was first constructed by the Italian firm of Messrs. Gaustalla and Company (now styled The Aden Salt Works) in the year 1885 an d it carries on a profitable business in salt production at Shiekh Othman. This was followed by the salt work constructed in 1909 by the Bombay firm of Messrs. Abdullabhoy and Joomabhoy Lalljee and Company. Two more salt works have since been constructed by Messrs. Hajeebhoy Laljee and Company and the Little Aden Salt Industrial Com pany in May, 1923, and October, 1927, respectively, and which continue to work successfully. The total quantity of salt exported to India and other places during the last year was 396,592 tons. The monopoly of salt for local consumption is in the hands of Government, who have licensed certain pits to Arabs at Shiekh Othman. The Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act passed by the Indian Legislature in 1931 and since extended to April, 1938, has benefited the Aden salt industry, which under the protection of the duty supplies about two-thirds of the total salt imports into India. Dhow Building. Dhows are built at Maala by a number of Hadhrami mer chants settled in Aden. They turn out about seven vessels a year, the average carrying capacity of which is about 200 tons. The dhows are constructed of Indian teak from the Malabar coast and are well built and fast. They sail to India (Bombay and Malabar coast) and to the East African coast as well as to neighbouring Arabian ports, and take a large share in local trade, in spite of the competition of the coasting steamers of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers and of Monsieur A. Besse (Halal Shipping Company). Soap Manufacturing. A soap manufacturing industry started by Monsieur A. Besse in December, 1932, at Maala is progressing satisfactorily. The soap is manufactured by boiling coconut oil and cold processes. Local labour of 40 men is employed. The output is about 50 cases daily, each case containing 200 cakes which are disposed of locally or exported to the Red Sea ports.II ADEN, 1937 Dyeing. There are three factories which do business in dyeing cloth and each employs on an average about 60 persons daily. There are in addition about 18 dyers who do business on a small scale. The dyed goods are mainly exported to Mombasa, Mogadiscio, Massowa, Hodeidah, and the interior of Arabia. Cigarette Making. The cigarette industry is conducted on a fairly large scale by Jews and Greeks with tobacco imported from Egypt. VII.—COMMERCE. Customs. Aden being a free port, there are no customs duties. Trade. The trade of Aden is mainly transhipment, as the port is a centre for trade between all ports of the world and the neigh bouring territories. The principal business is in skins, hides, coffee, cotton piece goods, grain and pulse, sugar, spices, oils, tobacco, gums, shells, and salt. The total value of the sea borne trade in the year under report (12 months January to December 1937), exclusive of transhipment cargo, was Rs.12,58,94,031 (imports Rs.8,03,85,836 and exports Rs.4,55,08,195), showing an increase of Rs.1,57,18,773 as compared with the total of Rs. 11,01,75,258 (imports and exports for the previous official year—12 months, April, 1936 to March, I 937 —imports Rs.6,87,17,900 and exports Rs.4,14,57,358). Merchandise increased by Rs.79,67,977, and treasure increased to Rs.77,50,796. The increase of Rs.79,67,977 in merchandise was mainly in grain and pulse, hides and skins, coal, oils, vehicles, tea, gums, and salt. The increase of Rs.77,50,796 in treasure was due to transactions in imports and exports of Maria Theresa dollars, in which there was considerable speculation. The Trade Registration Department was formerly a branch of the Aden Port Trust Revenue Department, but on the recom mendation of Mr. J. Sladen, who was deputed to Aden in the year 1906 on special duty, it was separated from the 1st April, 1907, and became a Government department. The department is however supervised by the Secretary, Aden Port Trust. The old Qafilah office at Barrier Gate, where the registration of inland trade is conducted, was taken over by the Govern ment from the Aden Port Trust in 1910 and subsequently converted into an office and quarters for the Qafilah clerk in 1914. The following statement shows the total value of the imports and exports sea-borne trade of Aden for the last five years.ADEN, 1937 13 The following table shows the value of the most important articles of the export trade for the last five years: — Articles. 1933 - 34 - 1934 - 35 - 1935 - 36 . 1936 - 37 - 1937 - Rs.

Agricultural Labour. There being no agriculture in the Colony, the question of agricultural labour does not arise. Industrial Labour. Workers for heavy manual labour are obtained from the Protectorate and the Yemen. This form of labour is principally confined to the shipping companies and the salt-works. The demand for cargo and coal coolies varies, and the local com panies arrange through their agents to recruit labour as and when required. The salt companies employ a permanent staff of coolies who are recruited by local agents from the Protec torate and the Yemen. These agents arrange to replace casualties and recruit extra labour when necessary. The interests of the workmen are safeguarded by the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act of 1923 and the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, which are applicable in the Colony.14 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL IX.—WAGES AND COST OF LIVING. The inhabitants of Aden are principally engaged in trading and shop-keeping and domestic employment. The large numbers of coolies employed by the salt-works, shipping concerns and contractors are from the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen. The small harbour craft are manned by Somalis, who take kindly to this form of semi-stationary employment. More than half of the personal servant class is from the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen. Clerical labour in public offices and large commercial firms is mostly Indian, although as educa tion improves more and more local Arabs are finding employ ment in Government offices and European firms. Local Arab firms employ Arab clerical labour almost exclusively. Masons and building operatives are principally from the Yemen. The following rates of wages are paid: — Coolies from 8 to 12 annas a day (8 hours). Masons from 1 to 3 rupees a day (8 hours). Carpenters from 1 to 3 rupees a day (8 hours). Clerks from Rs.35 to Rs.250 a month (according to grade). Personal servants Rs.15 to Rs.50 a month. Motor-drivers Rs.40 to Rs.ioo a month. The daily staple food of a coolie is 2 lb. flour, 2 ounces of ghee, and also fish or meat to the cost of about 2 annas. The total value of the food consumed daily is about 6 annas. The cost of living in the case of others varies with the emolu ments of the individual concerned. European standard would average Rs.5 a day exclusive of servants’ wages, cost of enter taining and club expenses. X.—EDUCATION, WELFARE INSTITUTIONS, AND RECREATION. Education. Organisation and Administration. While Aden was attached to India, the administration of education followed, with some local modifications, the system obtaining in the Bombay Presidency, and no radical changes in internal organization have been effected since the constitution of Aden as a Colony. The administration is carried out, under the Governor, by an Education Officer, assisted by a clerical staff. The post of Educa tion Officer was held until November, 1937, by an Indian officer seconded from the Indian Education Service. It is now held by a British officer of the Colonial Education Service. From March, 1933, to March, 1937, there was also an Assistant Educa tion Officer whose main duty was to improve the teaching inADEN, 1937 15 Arabic primary schools. This post, now abolished, was held by a seconded Arab officer of the Palestine Education Department. To advise Government on educational matters there is an Advisory Committee, consisting of leading citizens under the chairmanship of the Civil Secretary. In respect of management and degree of Government control, schools are classified as Government recognized aided, recog nized unaided, and unrecognized unaided. In respect of academic standard and nature of instruction they are classified as secondary, primary, “ indigenous ” and “ special During the period under review there were no recognized unaided schools, and this category, therefore, will be omitted in the tables which follow. Primary Education. The normal primary course is of four to five years, consisting of a preparatory stage, of one to two years, and three standards above it. Primary education is given so far as is possible through the vernaculars of the pupils and, except in cases where no ver nacular education is obtainable, pupils are not allowed to enter a school in which English is used throughout as the medium until they have completed a primary course through their own ver nacular. In Government schools and in most others, English is not taught during the primary course. The language of over 60 per cent, of the population and the language of instruction in the Government primary schools, both boys’ and girls’, is Arabic. Primary school education for boys and girls is provided also through English, Gujarati and Urdu in aided schools and through Hebrew, to a limited extent, in unrecognized schools. The following table shows the number of primary schools in Boys. Girls. Government 4 2 Aided 5 4 Unrecognized 3 1 Average number on rolls ... / 1,221 \ 15 120* 512 * The large majority of these were in the lower classes of the Urdu schools. The numbers of pupils in Government and aided primary schools were: boys 889, girls 481. Of the aided schools, two girls’ schools are maintained by the Roman Catholic Mission and one by the Danish Church Mission; one boys’ school by the Church of Scotland Mission and the rest by private local management. The unaided schools are all under private local management. At the end of the primary course a public examination is held, mainly as a qualifying test for admission to the lower sectioni6 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL of the Government Secondary School. In 1937 132 candidates entered for this examination and 102 passed. Failure in this examination does not necessarily debar a pupil from entering the secondary school, but priority of place is generally given to those who pass. No provision is made for Gujarati, Hebrew or English in this examination. “ Indigenous ” Schools, Quran Schools and Talmud Toras. “ Indigenous ” schools are schools of a primitive nature which attempt to serve the immediate requirements of certain classes of a conservative population. They combine with religious teaching some measure of general primary education. The more advanced of these are assisted by Government, mainly through per capita grants and through free loans of text-books and school equipment. Quran schools and Talmud Toras are, in most cases, still more primitive and provide little or no general education. The figures for these schools in 1937 are as below: — Indigenous Schools, Number of Number on Rolls. Quran Schools and Talmud Toras. Schools. Boys. Girls. Aided 3 87 27 Unrecognized ... 33 987 154 It has been the practice for a number of children to pass through these schools before applying for entrance to proper primary schools. Secondary Education. The full secondary course is at present of six standards, at the end of which candidates sit for the Junior Cambridge Examination. This course may be taken completely through English in three aided and two unrecognized schools. For schools using media other than English, the course is of two sections, a lower of three standards through the vernacular and a higher of three standards through English. The lower secondary course is available for boys through Arabic in the Government and one aided school, and through Gujarati in one other aided school. Pupils attending Urdu primary schools endeavour to acquire during their primary course sufficient Arabic to enable them to join an Arabic lower secondary course, because funds, public or private, do not permit of the provision of a lower secondary course through Urdu. A lower secondary course is provided in the Jewish boys' school, but the medium of instruction is Arabic though written in Hebrew characters. The teaching of English is begun, in Government schools, in the first year of the secondary course. Secondary education for girls is obtainable only through English, in the two Franciscan convent schools.ADEN, 1937 17 The number of secondary schools in 1937 was as follows: — Boys — Lower and Higher Secondary Lower Secondary ...

Special Schools. . °nly vocational or technical training regularly provided is m commercial subjects. Attached to the Government Secondary School are evening classes conducted by a member °Ithe school staff and attended partly by present pupils of the school and partly by students from outside. There is also an unrecognized institution, the Aden Commercial Institute, which provides both general and commercial education. The com mercial subjects studied are mainly book-keeping, typing and shorthand. Candidates from both these institutions are pre sented for the various examinations of the London Chamber of Commerce. Numbers of students in 1937 were: — Government Evening Commercial Class ... 19 Aden Commercial Institute Ton LI NANCE. Government expenditure on education in the calendar year 1937 amounted to Rs.63,000 exclusive of cost of repairs to buildings Of this sum Rs.20,737 were paid out in grants-in-aid —Ks.767 to indigenous schools, Rs.7,061 to primary schools, and Ks.12,909 to secondary schools. School fees are charged in Government boys' schools at rates on a scale rising from i anna per month in Standard I in the Primary School to Rs.2/8/- in Standard VI of the Secondaryl8 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL School. A number of free places are provided for poor and meritorious students. No fees are charged in the Government girls' schools. Contributions towards Government expenditure on education are made by the Aden Settlement and by the Aden Port Trust; for the financial year 1937-8, in which the expenditure is esti mated to be Rs.93,900, these contributions will amount to Rs.50,000 and Rs.15,000 respectively. Welfare Institutions. There are no welfare institutions in Aden Colony. The Silver Jubilee (Destitute) Fund is administered by the Chairman of the Aden Settlement, and the interest from the investments is used to provide for relief, principally at Sheikh Othman. Recreation. Facilities exist for every form of recreation. The Aden Football Association exercises general control of the numerous football clubs and is endeavouring to raise the general standard of play and encourage the right spirit. In addition to the military grounds at Steamer Point (Tawahi) there are grounds reserved for the local inhabitants at Tawahi, Crater, Maala, and Sheikh Othman. Hockey and cricket are played both at Tawahi and Crater. Apart from the military grounds there is only one hockey ground at Crater. There are tennis clubs in Crater and Tawahi and one in the military area, which is exclusively for civil and military Europeans. Polo and golf and squash rackets are played at Khormaksar, and No. 8 (b) Squadron have a golf course of their own. There is a European bathing club at Gold Mohur Bay, which is open to non-residents on payment of a small charge. At Tawahi there is a European social club and another small social club, the members of which are principally Anglo-Indians and Goans. The Arabs have organized two social clubs, one at Crater and the other at Tawahi. They interest themselves in social matters and provide facilities on their premises for games and meetings. Arabic periodicals are taken and occasionally lectures are given. XI.—COMIVIUNI CATION AND TRANSPORT. Shipping. The number of vessels, exclusive of country craft, which entered the port of Aden from the 1st April, 1937, to the 31st March, 1938, was 2,261 with an aggregate tonnage of 8,878,040. The number of country craft entering the port during 1937 was 1,254 with an aggregate tonnage of 53,891. During recent years Aden has developed rapidly as an oil- bunkering port. This is due mainly to its favourable geographi cal position, as it is nearer to the Persian oil fields than any otherADEN, 1937 jg port on the main shipping route between Europe and the East and also to the policy of the Aden Port Trust, which has aimed at giving ample facilities for oil fuelling while keeping the charges on this business as low as possible.

Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers and the Halal Shipping Company, Limited, maintain a fleet of21 ADEN, 1937 five and three steamers respectively which run between Aden and Mukalla, Shehr, Berbera, Zeila, Perim, Djibouti, Mocha, Kamaran, Hodeidah, Gizan, Medi and Port Sudan. Very frequent services of dhows also trade to and from these ports and in addition to many other little ports on both sides of southern Red Sea, Gulf of Aden up to Persian Gulf and also to Socotra. Many other shipping lines make occasional calls at Aden in connection with cargo, and other lines call at Aden for bunkers only. The only ports for which there is a poor direct service are the Levant Spanish and Portuguese ports- Cargo is sent with transhipment at Port Said. Roads. There are no railways in the Colony and all transport is by road or by sea. The sea transport is not great and consists of the carriage of salt and building materials from Little Aden to Tawahi and Maala. It is difficult to give an accurate estimate of the road mileage as the side roads in the town which are used principally by pedestrians and camels do not require to be kept up, and the Royal Air Force maintain certain of the roads which lie in the Military Area. The Aden Settlement maintain 13 miles of bituminous macadam road and 19 miles of water-bound macadam road. Motor Transport. On the 31st December, 1937, there were 198 licensed public cars and 53 licensed omnibuses. The number of private cars was 367 and there were 66 licensed lorries and trucks. The following statement shows the countries of origin of the above motor vehicles: — No. of vehicles. 1. British Empire ... ... ... ... 234 2. United States of America... ... ... 391 3.

Post Office. The Postmaster at Steamer Point is responsible for the postal services under the general control of the Finance Officer. The offices in the Colony are situated at Steamer Point, Camp and22 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL Khormaksar. In addition there is a sub-office on Kamaran Island in the Red Sea and one at Mukalla in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. The Eastern Aden Protectorate has also a number ot postal agencies. Prior to the ist April, 1937, Aden was included in the Indian Postal System and Indian postage stamps were used. As from the date mentioned, Aden became a separate Postal Administra tion with its own issue of stamps. The stamp design includes a vignette of an Arab dhow, a ypc ot craft which has been associated with Aden from time immemorial. The denominations of stamps are: annas A £ 1 Zj’ 3 &gt; 3 lb an d 8; and rupees 1, 2, 5, and 10. ? n ^ e . ma i n shipping route between Europe and the bar East, is an important office of exchange. Mails from Europe and India arrive weekly on the P. and O. mail steamer. Pags tor British Somaliland are transhipped to a local steamer sailing for Berbera. Mails for East Africa are unloaded and warehoused in the Steamer Point Post Office until a suitable opportunity occurs to forward them to Mombasa, Tanga Zanzibar or Dar es Salaam as the case may be. Mails are despatched to India and Europe weekly by the P. and O mail steamers. Mails between Aden and the local Red Sea and Aden Gulf ports are carried by the local steamers of Messrs. Cowasiee Din- shaw and Brothers and the Halal Shipping Company. Use is a so made of the Royal Air Force planes and a local air service to the Hadhramaut and Djibouti. Aden is off the main trunk air routes from Europe to India and Africa. Air mail letters for transmission to places served by Imperial Airways are sent to Egypt by steamer in the first instance. The principal letter rates are: — Inland and India— Not exceeding one tola Each additional tola ... United Kingdom and British Possessions— Not exceeding one oz. ... Each additional oz. Foreign Countries— Not exceeding one oz. ... Each additional oz. 1 anna. 1 2 &gt;&gt; 2^ annas. 2 ,, 3^ annas. 2 Registration Fee ... ... ... ^ Parcels are accepted for transmission directly or indirectlv with nearly every country in the world, and a cash-on-deliverv service operates with Great Britain and with India. Letters and parcels may be insured up to a value of Rs.3,000. Direct money-order services exist between Aden and Great Britain, India, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, Tanganyika,ADEN, 1937 23 Zanzibar and the Italian East African colonies. Indirectly, money-orders may be sent to nearly every country in the world. By far the greatest volume of traffic is between Aden and India. On an average about 6 lakhs are remitted to India by money-order annually. British postal-orders are on sale and are cashed at all sub- offices. £ There is a Post Office Savings Bank. The amount standing to the credit of depositors in 1937 was about 6 lakhs. Interest is paid at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum. There is no internal telegraph system. The telephone system is described in the following paragraph. External telegraphic communication (both by cable and wireless) is maintained by the Eastern Telegraph Company. Telegraphs. External telegraphic communication with Aden is maintained by the Eastern Telegraph Company. This company was formed in 1872 to take over, and operate as a whole, cables between England and India, which had already been laid and were being worked under the control of several independent companies. The formation of the Eastern Telegraph Company was followed by a steady development of the cable system, and Aden immediately became an important junction station, inasmuch as the Red Sea cables branch out from Aden to Bombay, Colombo, Seychelles and Zanzibar, and telegrams from England and the West generally, destined for India, Ceylon and the Far East, Mauritius and Madagascar, and East and South Africa were retransmitted from Aden into the correspond ing cable eastwards. Although, with modern improvements and inventions, retrans mission by intermediate stations along a chain of cables is now done by automatic relays, Aden has always remained an important cable centre, and is in touch with all parts of the world through the communications system of Cable and Wireless Limited with which the Eastern Telegraph Company is now associated. The Eastern Telegraph Company also operates a wireless station, maintaining point-to-point services between Aden and Berbera, Djibouti, Kamaran, Perim, Mukalla, Assab, Alula and Bahrain. Direct communication with the Yemen is provided by means of a cable from Aden, which is landed at Sheikh Said on the Yemen coast opposite Perim. The main cable office at Ras Boradli is always open for the reception and despatch of telegrams. There are branch offices at Steamer Point and Aden Camp, which serve the shipping and business centre.24 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL Telephones. The Government Telephone Exchange is worked on the central battery system and has a capacity of 200 exchange lines. Early telephone developments in Aden were associated with the defence of the fortress. The first system (a magneto one) was installed and operated by the military authorities and later, when the Air Ministry became responsible for defence, the control of the telephones naturally passed to that Ministry. From 1927 onwards endeavours were made to get the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department to accept responsibility for the system, but it was not till 1932 that the Indian Authorities took it over. By that time the magneto exchange and the over head lines had reached the end of their useful life. The old system was therefore discontinued and a new central battery system constructed at a cost (including buildings) of about Rupees 1,50,000. The present rates for direct connections are: — Rs. Within a radius of 3 miles of the exchange ... 300 per annum. For each additional half mile or fraction thereof ... 40 An extension in the same building costs Rs. 120/- per annum. XII.—PUBLIC WORKS. The public works in Aden are managed by the Aden Port Trust who maintain a separate staff for this department. For this service the Port Trust are paid the actual expenditure of this department plus 7|- per cent, for office accommodation and other incidental expenses. A general programme of minor works was carried out. Pro vision was also made for the construction of quarters for the Chief Justice, the Legal Adviser and the Education Officer, but these houses were only partially complete at the end of the year. Two of the Political Officers' bungalows, started in December, 1936, were completed and occupied and the bungalow for the third Political Officer was started. Works in connection with roads, the development of the water supply and the electricity supply were undertaken by the Aden Settlement. The harbour and wharves are under the control of the Aden Port Trust. General works of improvement were carried out during the year. XIII.—JUSTICE, POLICE AND PRISONS. Justice and Crime. The Colony has a Supreme Court with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay—ADEN, 1937 25 {a) in civil cases— (i) from any final judgment where the value of the subject-matter in dispute in appeal is Rs.5,000 or upwards, (ii) with the leave of the Supreme Court or the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, from any judgment, final or interlocutory, if, by reason of the importance of the question involved in the appeal or otherwise, the Court is satisfied that leave to appeal ought to be granted; and {b) in criminal cases, from any judgment, provided that the sentence imposed is one of imprisonment exceeding six months or of fine exceeding Rs.500 or is one which includes such imprisonment or fine. When sentence of death is passed, an appeal, whether lodged or not, is deemed to have been lodged and the Courts concerned act accordingly. A second appeal lies to His Majesty in Council— [a) as of right, from any final judgment of the High Court, when the value of the subject matter in dispute in such second appeal is Rs. 10,000 or upwards, provided that, in case the judgment appealed from affirms the decision of the Supreme Court, the second appeal involves some sub stantial question of law; and (b) at the discretion of the High Court, from any other judgment, whether final or interlocutory if in the opinion of the High Court, the question involved in the second appeal is one of great general or public importance. The Supreme Court is presided over by a Chief Justice. It is the only Court of appeal in the Colony and also has powers of revision. The other Civil Courts in the Colony are: — (1) the Court of the Registrar, and (2) the Court of Small Causes. The Registrar of the Supreme Court is the Judge of both these Courts. The jurisdiction of the Court of the Registrar extends to all original suits wherein the value of the claim does not exceed Rs.1,000; but certain suits of a prescribed nature are excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court, e.g., Suits concerning acts or orders done or made by officers of Government in their official capacity; suits for specific performance or rescission of a contract, rectification or cancellation of an instrument, or an injunc tion; suits relating to a trust; suits upon foreign judgments;26 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL suits for a general average loss or salvage, or compensa tion in respect of collision between ships; suits for restitution of conjugal rights, divorce, or the custody of a minor. The Court of Small Causes has jurisdiction, save as regards certain suits excepted from its cognizance, provided the value of the subject matter does not exceed Rs.500. An appeal lies to the Supreme Court from every decree passed by the Court of the Registrar and from every decree passed by the Court of Small Causes provided that the value of the claim exceeds Rs.50. Subject to the provisions of any Statute in force in England which expressly applies in the Colony or has been extended thereto by Order in Council and of any enactment for the time being in force in the Colony, and so far as the said Statute or enactment shall not extend or apply, the Civil Courts in the Colony exercise their jurisdiction in conformity with usage, and, in the absence of usage, in conformity with the substance of the common law, the doctrines of equity, and the Statutes of general application in force in England on the 1st April, 1937. The common law, doctrines of equity and Statutes of general application are applied so far only as the circumstances of the Colony and its inhabitants permit and subject to such qualifica tions as local circumstances may render necessary. In particular, the personal laws of Mohammedans, Hindus, Jews and Parsees are applied, save in so far as these laws have been expressly superseded by legislation, in matters of marriage, divorce, guardianship, inheritance, etc. The enactments in force in the Colony on the 31st December, 1937, include twenty-five Ordinances enacted during the period under review and all Indian and Bombay Acts and Regulations in force in the Colony on the 31st March, 1937, not expressly repealed thereafter. The Supreme Court is the only Criminal Court having power to pass a sentence of imprisonment exceeding two years or fine exceeding one thousand rupees. All trials in the Supreme Court are^by jury. In the case of Europeans and Americans, the majority of the jurors must be Europeans or Americans. The other Criminal Courts of the Colony are those of— (1) the Chief Magistrate, (2) Divisional Magistrates at Tawahi, Crater, Sheikh Othman and Perim. An appeal lies to the Supreme Court in all cases in which a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one month or of fine exceeding Rs.50 has been passed. The Supreme Court has also powers of revision.ADEN, 1937 27 No sentence of death can be passed on a pregnant woman or a youthful offender.

There are five lawyers practising in the Courts of the Colony, three being Hindus, one a Mohammedan, and one a Parsee. Sanads are granted by the Supreme Court under rules made under the Supreme Courts Ordinance. Two of these lawyers are barristers-at-law and the other three have Indian legal qualifications.29 ADEN, 1937 Police.

There is an Advisory Committee consisting of a President, two officials and two non-official members, which meets every six months to review sentences of long-term prisoners (five years and upwards). One meeting of the Advisory Board was held during the year and one case of a long-term prisoner was reviewed; the convict in question was not recommended for release.30 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL XIV.—LEGISLATION. Twenty-five Ordinances were enacted between the inception of the Colony on the ist April, 1937, and the close of the year. The most important of these were the following: — General Clauses Acts {Adaptation). This Ordinance provided the necessary new terminology, etc., for carrying on the Indian and Bombay Acts in force before the birth of the Colony. Interpretation and General Clauses. On the usual Colonial model. Criminal Courts Ordinance, modelled on the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, with provision for jury trials in the Supreme Court, with appeals to the High Court of Bombay under the Aden Colony Order, 1936. Income Tax, following closely the repealed Indian Income Tax Acts. Civil Courts Ordinance, adapting, with little change, the Indian Code of Civil Procedure for the continuance of the Supreme Court, Registrar’s and Small Causes Courts. Stamp Ordinance, following closely the Indian Stamp Act. Limitation, following the Indian Limitation Act. Court Fees, continuing the former fees as varied under Bombay. Guardians and Wards, following the Indian Guardian and Wards Act, but with larger discretion to the Judge in the interests of the minor. Pensions, on the usual Colonial Model. Police, adapting the Bombay Police Law. Prisons, closely following the repealed Indian Acts. Excise, a short and simple adaptation of the Bombay Abkari Act. Aden being a free port, liquor is one of the few excisable articles. Dangerous Drugs and Poisons, a short law in Colonial form superseding the Indian Acts and Opium Act. Subsidiary Legislation during 1937. Civil Courts Rules, containing the less important provisions of the Indian Civil Procedure Code. Excise Rules, replacing all the rules under the repealed Bombay Akbari Act. Dangerous Drugs and Poisons Rules, replacing the Dangerous Drugs, Poisons and Bombay Opium Rules. The Indian Workmen's Compensation and Factories Acts are still in force in the Colony. There is no legislative provision for health insurance, old age pensions, etc., in the Colony. XV.—BANKING, CURRENCY, AND WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. Banking. The National Bank of India Limited is established in the Colony with its chief office in the Crater and a branch at Steamer Point. The commercial firm of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers also carries on the business of banking.3 i % ADEN, 1937 Currency. The monetary unit is the Indian rupee (silver) and is legal tender for any amount. The subsidiary Indian coins are:- Silver— Half rupee. Quarter rupee. Nickel— Four anna piece. Two anna piece. One anna piece. Bronze— Single pice (£ anna). . ° n e pie piece (i-12th anna). Subsidiary corns are legal tender for sums not exceeding one rupee. Indian Government currency notes are in circulation— the denominations being Rs.5, Rs.io, Rs.50, and Rs.ioo.

When it is exhausted the provision of currency in Aden will be arranged through the wnm The Governn jent, however, will take steps to see that condition COmage and notes in circulation are kept in good Weights and Measures. The Imperial weights and measures are in common use, as also are certain Indian weights. For instance, in the Post Office inland letters are exchanged at so much per tola : foreign letters however, are weighed by the ounce. A tola is the weight of a freshly minted rupee, i.e., 0-4114 of an ounce. Eighty tolas = 1 seer and 40 seers = a Bombay maund (about 80 lb.). There is however, a local maund which is only 28 lb. XVI.—PUBLIC FINANCE AND TAXATION. As u Urc Colony only came into existence on the 1st April, I 937 &gt; the figures of revenue and expenditure for the first financial year are not yet available. The approved and revised estimates for 1937-8 are as follows: — Revenue. Duties, Taxes, etc. ... Court Fees and Government Services Reimbursements Posts and Telephones Miscellaneous... Approved Estimates. Rs. 931.000 91,900 325,260 261.000 55,000 Revised Estimates. Rs. 950.000 110.000 35 0 . 000 600.000 50,000 1,664,160 2,060,00032 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL Expenditure. Rs.

The increase under Extraordinary Expenditure arises out of the necessity to build quarters for the Chief Justice, the Legal Adviser and the Education Officer. The surplus for the year 1937/38 will be just oyer Rs.3 lakhs, which will practically wipe out the excess of liabilities taken over from the Government of India. It is estimated that the financial year 1938 / 39 will open with assets just about balancing the liabilities. Rs. 1,597, 000 160,000 1,757,000 Public Debt. The Colony has no public debt. Taxation. The main source of revenue is Income Tax which is levied under the Income Tax Ordinance 1937. In the case of every company and registered firm the rate is two annas and four and a sixth pies in the rupee; in the case of individuals, etc., the rate varies from six and a half pies in the rupee on incomes over Rs.2,000 to two annas and four and a sixth pies in the rupee on incomes over Rs. 100,000. In respect of the excess of total income over a specified figure which varies from Rs.30,000 f° Rs.75,000 according to the circumstances. Supertax is also charged. There are no customs duties, but there is an excise duty on intoxicating liquors. The production of salt is subject to a tax which is collected when the commodity is exported or sold for local consumption. Practically the whole of the salt tax revenue is derived from salt exported to India and the Far East. The tax on salt so exported is 8 annas per ton.ADEN, 1937 33 The revenue derived from the taxation of motor vehicles accrues to the Aden Settlement, which body undertakes the maintenance and improvement of roads. XVIL—MISCELLANEOUS. Port Administration. The Port of Aden, which affords safe accommodation for vessels up to 33 feet in draught (vessels of deeper draught can be handled by working the tides) is administered by a Board of Trustees constituted under the Port Trust Act V of 1888. The Board is at present composed of four officials including the Chairman, who is also Chairman of the Aden Settlement, and seven non-officials. The Trustees are appointed by the Governor for a period of two years. The minimum depth of water at low tide available in the approach channel and inner mooring basin except the four deep water berths is 32' 6'; there are four oil-berths connected to the land installation by submarine pipe-lines, and two have been dredged to a minimum depth of 35 feet at L.W. There are two other berths dredged to a similar depth available for the supply of bunker coal and for general purposes. The Port Trust maintain a pilot service consisting of one Harbour Master and five pilots. The Aden Port Trust publish a separate administration report. Mercantile marine matters are dealt with by a Port Officer. The present incumbent is an officer of the Royal Indian Navy and is also Superintendent of Lighthouses. Aden Port Trust Finance.

GEOGRAPHY, CLIMATE AND HISTORY Geography The Colony of Aden is situated on the south coast of Arabia and is bounded on the seaward side by the Gulf of Aden and on the landward side by the Aden Protectorate. It comprises :— {a) The peninsula, an extinct volcano in the crater of which lies the old town of Aden which is the main commercial and residential centre of the Colony. On the north shore is the modern harbour suburb of Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area usually referred to as Steamer Point, a large part of which is leased in perpetuity to the Air Ministry with the exceptions of the areas occupied by Government House, the Eastern Telegraph Company’s buildings and the Political Secretary’s house. To the North of Tawahi lies the dhow harbour and the village of Maala. (6) The isthmus known as Khormaksar. (c) An area of land enclosing the modern harbour and extending north and west to the Little Aden Peninsula. The villages of Sheikh Othman, Hiswa, Imad and Buraikha andADEN, 1938 3 Fakum, the last two on the Little Aden Peninsula, are situated in this area. (d) The island of Perim. Description The Aden Peninsula is high, rocky and of volcanic formation ; Jabel Shamsan, its summit, is 1,725 feet (525 m.) high and there are some turreted peaks close to it. The harbour lies westward and north-west of the peninsula. Crater, the main Arab town, is situated at a distance of five miles from the modern harbour and lies in the crater of the extinct volcano on the east of the peninsula. The isthmus is a flat sandy plain which is barely f mile wide at its narrowest point near the peninsula. Cultivation occurs at Sheikh Othman in the form of a large vegetable and fruit garden belonging to the Aden Settlement, but except during the cold weather months produce is very limited. There are also privately- owned date palms there. Hiswa has several groves of palms, but with these exceptions there is no regular cultivation in the Colony. Perim Perim Island, situated in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandab, is bare, rocky and rather flat in appearance ; its highest point, about a mile northward of its southern extremity, is 214 feet (65 m.) high. The surface of the island is grooved with dry water courses and covered with coarse grass and stunted shrubs, the subsoil being sand and conglomerate coral. Perim Harbour and False Bay, a small shoal light, lie on the southern side of the island. Perim was at one time of importance as a coaling station, and the Eastern Telegraph Company and Lloyd’s were represented there. There are now no commercial concerns on the island. Climate There is a third-class meteorological observatory in Aden under the superintendence of the Medical Officer in charge of the European General Hospital. The minimum day temperature recorded was 69-1 in February, 1938, and the maximum was 101-5 i n July* I 938. The rainfall totalled 1 • 59 centimetres. Hot sandy winds prevailed as usual during the south-west monsoon. There are no crops in Aden, which depends on supplies from other countries, principally India and the interior. The climate of Aden from October to April, i.e., during the north east monsoon, is cool and pleasant, especially from November to February. During the south-west monsoon, i.e. in July and August, strong winds prevail which give some relief from the damp airless heat of May, June and September. Sandstorms are apt to occur in the months of May, June, July and August. These come from a northerly direction usually a short time before sunset and are oftenCOLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL 4 very intense, though usually of short duration. The weather during July and August is frequently very hazy, and it is not uncommon for ships to pass quite close to Aden without picking up the land. Meteorological records are maintained at the European General Hospital and the data are published in the Aden Colony Gazette weekly. History Aden has been a place of importance historically owing to its possession of the only good harbour situated on the main ocean trade route between Egypt and India and to the fact that it is easily defensible. Prior to the discovery of the Cape route in the fifteenth century the trade followed much the same course as the main trade route between the East and the West does today, i.e. across the Indian Ocean to Aden, thence up the Red Sea and across Egypt to the Mediterranean. From the earliest times the great Empires of the world realised the importance of Aden. During the time of the Romans at least two endeavours were made by them to capture the Red Sea trade and they sent an unsuccessful expedition against Aden. The discovery of the Cape route at the end of the sixteenth century diverted the major portion of the trade from the old Red Sea route, and in consequence the port of Aden declined. Aden was attacked by the Portuguese in 1513 and 1516, and was for a time occupied by them. It was captured by the Turks in 1538 and remained in their hands about 100 years until the Yemen Arabs rebelled and drove them out. Aden thus passed under the Imams of Sana' who have never renounced their claim to it. In 1728 the Sultan of Lahej, the Ruler of the territory adjacent to Aden, revolted and established his independence, and included Aden in his Sultanate. The decline of Aden continued until its capture by the British in 1839, when it was only a village of 500 inhabitants. Financial negotiations with the Sultan of Lahej having failed, the plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden resulted in an expedition being sent from Bombay by the East India Company under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy. The fortress was captured on 19th January, 1839, and Captain Haines became the first British Resident. The replacement of sailing ships by steam vessels was one of the reasons which led to Aden’s occupation by the British, and the revival of the Red Sea route and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 regained for the town its old importance. As a result of the increased prosperity of Aden since the British occupation the population has risen from 500 to 46,000. The modern commercial prosperity of Aden is primarily due to the fact that it is an important fuelling station, originally for coal and now for coal and oil. It is nearer than any other large port on the main eastern trade route to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s production centre in the PersianADEN, 1938 5 Gulf, which enables oil to be supplied at favourable rates, and the consequent inducement to ships to call for bunkers has also led to an increase of transit trade to the East African and Red Sea ports. Perim The first trace of the occupation of Perim Island goes back as far as 1738 when the French landed there after the bombardment of Mocha. It was not until 5th May, 1799, that the British took formal possession, but it is recorded that, owing to difficulties in maintaining a supply of water, they evacuated the island in Septem ber of that year. Perim was reoccupied by the British in January, 1857, under instructions from Lord Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, to Sir William Coghlan, Political Resident and Commander, Aden, and Lieutenant Templar in the “ Mahi ” was deputed to effect the occupation. The island was then placed under the control of an Assistant to the Political Resident at Aden. This arrangement continued until 1929, when the Manager of the Perim Coal Company was appointed Government Agent. On the closing down of the Perim Coal Company in October, 1936, the Commissioner of Police, Aden, was appointed Administrator of the Island. A police detach ment is maintained at Perim, and the Administrator makes regular visits from Aden, usually performing the journey by air. II.—GOVERNMENT Prior to the 1st April, 1932, the territory now comprising the Colony was administered by a Resident under the control of the Government of Bombay. From the 1st April, 1932, Aden became a Chief Commissionership, and control was transferred from the Government of Bombay to the Governor-General of India in Council, the Chief Executive Officer at Aden being styled Chief Commissioner, Resident and Commander-in-Chief. On the 1st April, 1937, Aden was constituted a Crown Colony and was removed from the control of the Government of India. The Colony is administered by a Governor, who is also Commander-in-Chief, aided by an Executive Council which at present comprises five members. The Council consists of the persons holding the offices of Political Secretary and Civil Secretary and such other persons as the Governor in pursuance of instructions from His Majesty through the Secretary of State may from time to time appoint. At the present time, in addition to the ex-officio members, the Legal Adviser, the Finance Officer and the Chairman of the Port Trust and Settlement have been appointed to the Council. There is no Legislative Council. Military Garrison The Military Garrison of the Colony is under the command of an Air Officer Commanding. There is a Naval Office in charge of the Naval Ofhcer-in-Charge. 22541 A 26 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL III.—POPULATION According to the census of 1931, the total (civilian) population of the Aden Settlement was 45,992. This excludes the military forces and the population of Perim. The following table shows the population distribution by race and sex :— No. Race. S&lt; Males. zx. Females. 1. Arabs 18,388 10,341 2. Indians (Moslems) 2,829 2,393 3 - Somalis 2,070 2,107 4 - Indians (Hindus) ... 1,992 622 5 - Jews 2,114 2,006 6. Parsis 236 96 7 - Native Christians ... 339 207 8. Europeans 213 39 Total 28,181 17,811 The marked disproportion between the numbers of males and females is due to the fact that most of the Arabs of the trade and labouring class from the interior come to Aden without their women-folk. IV.—HEALTH The staff of the Medical Department in Aden consists of the Senior Medical Officer, a Civil Surgeon, two Resident Medical Officers and eight Assistant Medical Officers. There is a fully-qualified Lady Doctor attached to the Civil Hospital in Crater. The Senior Medical Officer is also Port Health Officer and has charge of the European General Hospital. There is also a Medical Officer of Health with an adequate subordinate staff. The two Government hospitals are the European General Hospital at Steamer Point and the Civil Hospital in Crater. The nursing staff of these institutions is maintained from funds provided by the Government of the Colony and the Prince of Wales's Aden Nursing Association in approximately equal proportions. The Prince of Wales's Aden Nursing Association is a charitable organization with invested funds raised originally by voluntary subscription, and the Association issues appeals to the public from time to time to supple ment the amount of money available from interest on its investments. Two dispensaries in charge of Assistant Medical Officers at Maala and Sheikh Othman respectively cater for the minor ailments of the local population in these districts, and serve as clearing stationsADEN, 1938 7 for the more serious cases which are transferred to the Civil Hospital. One Assistant Medical Officer is stationed on Perim Island where there is a small dispensary, with limited accommodation for in patients. The Keith Falconer South Arabia Mission has a large and well equipped hospital at Sheikh Othman staffed normally by two European doctors and a European nursing staff. Other charitable institutions are two dispensaries, one maintained by public subscription with a Government subsidy and the other supported entirely by the prominent Parsi firm of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw &amp; Brothers. The Royal Air Force hospital meets the medical requirements of the British Forces in Aden. There are several demists practising in the Colony, and the Royal Air Force has a fully qualified dentist, who is permitted private practice. A total of 19,141 out-patients, and 2,366 in-patients received treatment during the year 1938 in the two Government hospitals^ and, excluding the Royal Air Force hospital, but including other hospitals and dispensaries, a total of 67,694 out-patients and 3,872 in-parients were treated in the Colony during the year 1938 as compared with 60,069 and 3,206 in 1937. The general health of Aden has remained satisfactory throughout the year. Many of the insect-borne diseases commonly found in tropical and subtropical countries are absent and, although a mild intestinal infection is very common, serious diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery are rare. 1,292 cases of malaria were treated in the hospitals. From the investigation of the histories of these it was proved that all except 11 were due to infection acquired outside the Colony : all these cases were among service personnel resident in the leased military areas. The 12 cases of typhoid reported during the year show an increase on previous years, which is probably due to increased care taken in confirming the diagnosis of prolonged fevers. Minor outbreaks never assumed epidemic proportions, and in all cases water and milk supplies were examined and cleared from suspicion. There is a leprosy hospital at Sheikh Othman supported partly by the Government of Aden and partly by Aden Settlement funds and administered medically by the staff of the Keith Falconer South Arabia Mission. Here again the Colony of Aden acts as the kind sister to her neighbours, as almost all the patients hail from the interior. There has been no epidemic of major infectious or contagious diseases during the year. Chickenpox, measles and mumps crop up from time to time and are treated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital on Maala plain. 22541 A 3COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL 8 A small Lunatic Asylum is situated outside the walls of the Civil Hospital and is administered from it. The Port Health work is a very important feature in the medical and sanitary organization of the Colony. The proximity of Aden by sea to ports which are subject to periodic infections makes the careful inspection of vessels a vital matter, and in addition the services of the Port Health Officer are in constant demand to assist the masters of the many cargo ships which use the port and carry no doctor. Passengers and members of the crews requiring hospital treatment are accommodated in the European General Hospital, or, if the illness is an infectious one, in suitable isolation. A few cases of chickenpox and three cases of modified smallpox were landed from shipping during 1938. In the European General Hospital 66 residents of Aden and 155 patients from ships were treated as in-patients during the year. In all 23 different nationalities were represented. During 1938, 2,178 Bills of Health were issued to mechanically propelled vessels and 1,609 to native craft. V.—HOUSING General Houses in Aden are of stone masonry, except at Sheikh Othman where they are mostly built with sun-dried bricks. The control of housing in Aden is vested in the Executive Committee of the Settlement, and plans for new buildings and recon structions are passed by them after scrutiny by the Medical Officer of Health and the Settlement Engineer. Particular attention is paid to efficient lighting and ventilation. Each residential building is provided with sanitary and kitchen accommodation separated from the living rooms by open court-yards or by large shafts open to the sky. Most of the houses are provided with floors made of cement- concrete ; this is insisted upon in all new buildings, and the height of the houses is never allowed to exceed the width of the streets. Back-to-back houses are not allowed ; a few still exist in the village of Maala, but these are being demolished as opportunity occurs. At the rear of all houses there are open spaces from 5 ft. to 10 ft. wide. They are called sweeper passages, and the sanitary accom modation of the houses abuts on to these spaces and is drained into them. Each such passage is connected with the main drainage system in all divisions of the Settlement except Maala, where it is connected with a large soak pit. Every building plan is carefully scrutinized by the Public Health Department before construction is allowed.ADEN, 1938 9 Most of the dwelling-houses within the Settlement limits are well ventilated and lighted and are satisfactory from a public health point of view. Endeavours are being made to effect an improve ment in architectural standards. There are still a few buildings in Maala and Sheikh Othman where the old type of house exists, but improvement grows every year by demolition and reconstruction, and the majority of the population is comfortably housed. Water Supply The water supply of Aden is obtained from six bore-wells situated near the village of Sheikh Othman. The supply for the civil popu lation is pumped into two tanks each of 100,000 gallons capacity, and from these tanks the supply gravitates through a 15-in. main to a storage reservoir of 400,000 gallons capacity at the Isthmus. The total amount of water raised from these bore holes during 1938 was 236,178,000 gallons. This represents an average daily supply of 647,000 gallons, and taking the population as 47,000 an average of 14 gallons per head per day for all purposes. The following table gives details of the water used in Aden during the years 1936, 1937 and 1938. Details of water. 1936. 1937 - 1938. Total water raised at bore 204,887,000 207,368,000 236,178,000 holes. Total water delivered to 118,429,000 121,980,000 i 33 &gt; 525 &gt;o°o Fortress area.

The increase in the consumption of water for all purposes is due chiefly to the extension of the distribution mains. Maintenance Work The majority of the work carried out by the Water and Drainage Department comes under the above heading and includes the following :— (1) Pumping plant .—This comprises five reciprocating and five centrifugal pumps, all of which have been examined regularly and kept in good mechanical order. These pumps work on an average of 12 hours a day, and the supply was not once interrupted during the year. 22541 A 410 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL The standby electricity generating set was used once each week and generates enough energy to run two bore-hole pumps, giving approximately 17,000 gallons per hour. (2) Reservoirs and Tanks. —These comprise 11 steel plate tanks and two masonry reservoirs situated over the distribution system. (3) New Bore-hole Pump. —A new type of bore-hole pump, in which both the electric motor and the pump are lowered into the bore-hole and run submerged was purchased and installed in bore No. 3 at a cost of Rs. 11,925. The pump has not been entirely satisfactory as sand in the water has caused damage to the pump and motor bearings. It is con sidered that it proved, however, that the supply of water from the bores can be increased, without affecting the underground storage level. During a continuous test of 22 days, 8,976,000 gallons of water were raised from bore No. 3 without lowering the normal rest level. (4) Distribution. —The water-supply to the Fortress was uninter rupted during the year, and no restriction whatever in the use of water was imposed on the general public. Owing to the Electricity Department being unable to cope with the great demand for energy between the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. pumping at Sheikh Othman and Isthmus was restricted during these hours. Owing to the existing storage capacity of the reservoirs, this restriction was applied only to the shipping companies refilling their water boats for supplies to shipping during these four hours. In practice very little inconvenience was caused. (5) Storage Capacity. —The present storage capacity of the Approximate total hours Gallons. Domestic supply. hours.

(6) Water Connections. —The total number of water connections to different premises in Aden is 2 , 595 - The number of new con nections made during 1938 was 549 compared with 417 for the previous year.ADEN, 1938 II 3 I 5 premises were disconnected, of which 100 were eventually reconnected. (7) Other Supplies. —3,814,000 gallons of bore water were supplied free for flushing sewers and 120,000 gallons for fire fighting and practices. ( 8 ) Water Analysis — Chlorination. —Three bacteriological and one chemical analyses of both the raw and the chlorinated water were carried out during the year. The bacteriological analyses all showed very satisfactory results in respect of all the samples for drinking water. The chemical analysis showed that the water was very similar chemically to that tested in 1935 an d I 937 - It is noteworthy that the sodium chloride (salt) content has not increased. The whole of the water supply to the Fortress was automatically chlorinated at Isthmus, the dose being part per million by weight. The water at Sheikh Othman was also safeguarded by placing J lb. of bleaching powder in each tank every morning. VI.—PRODUCTION Veterinary Condition of Live Stock and Meat. —The condition of the live stock from the hinterland was not up to the usual standard, due to cattle being brought in from famine stricken areas. The condition of the live stock from British Somaliland, particularly sheep and goats, was very good. The quality of mutton was 1st class and beef 2nd class. Imports from British Somaliland and Djibouti :—72,180 sheep and goats, 157 oxen, 5 cows, 6 ponies, 2 mules. Imports from Arabian and Red Sea Ports: —1,519 sheep and goats, 5 milk cows, 15 horned cattle, 12 calves, 3 gazelles. Imports from the hinterland :—1,229 horned cattle, 617 large calves, 373 milk cows, 8,293 goats, kids and sheep, 34 camels, 15 donkeys 1 pony. Export from. Aden : —3,748 sheep and goats, 20 horned cattle, 16 large calves, 32 camels, 1 donkey, 19 monkeys. Bovine Contagious Disease. —Rinderpest accounted for 224 deaths among milk cattle and calves of Crater and Tawahi. Preventive Measures. —The epidemic was controlled by the following precautionary measures being taken :— 1. All infected animals were segregated. 2. Stables were regularly disinfected. 3. Cattle were inoculated with anti-Rinderpest serum. 4. Carcasses were incinerated and the movement of horned cattle was controlled. A 5 2254112 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL Equine Contagious Disease .—In February, sudden deaths amongst the hackney carriage horses occurred, and, as a result of post mortems, African horse sickness was suspected. By taking prompt precautionary measures, the disease was confined to Crater. Nine deaths were recorded. Three segregation camps for cattle are being constructed, two at Sheikh Othman and one at Maala. Fisheries Fishing is, generally speaking, good, but the quantity of fish caught is greatly influenced by the movements of the different species of sardinella on which the large species feed. Shark, barracuda, horse-mackerel, sea-perch, dolphins, the smaller members of the tunny family, rock cod soles, and mullet are the principal edible fish. Sword or sail fish make their appearance at certain seasons of the year, but are not easily saleable for human con sumption. Crabs and crawfish are to be had at all seasons, and oysters are available in the winter months. The fishermen are a very industrious people and employ various kinds of nets as well as hand-lines in their work. The nets used are of the stationary, circular throwing, and drag varieties, the latter being used from the shore. In addition a special net is operated from boats working in pairs during the monsoon period. Throwing nets for mullet, mackerel and a form of whitebait are also in use. The catch is at times greater than the requirements for local consumption, and the surplus is salted for export. Shark is almost invariably treated in this manner, and during some seasons large quantities are dried. Whitebait is exported. The fishermen are subject to certain rules which forbid trawls and limit the size of nets, and in addition they defer to the judgment of their elected Akils in matters of fishing custom. Licences to dive for pearls both in the harbour and in the waters of Perim are obligatory, but no licences are required to fish. Salt A salt work was first constructed by the Italian firm of Messrs. Gaustalla and Company (now styled The Aden Salt Works) in the year 1885, and it carries on a profitable business in salt production at Sheikh Othman. This was followed by the salt work constructed in 1909 by the Bombay firm of Messrs. Abdullabhoy andjoomabhoy Lalljee and Company. Two more salt works have since been constructed by Messrs. Hajeebhoy Laljee and Company and the Little Aden Salt Industrial Company in May, 1923, and October, 1927, respectively, and they continue to work successfully. The total quantity of salt exported to India and other places during the last year was 230,379 tons. The monopoly of salt for local consumption is in the hands of Government, who have licensed certain pits to Arabs at Sheikh Othman.ADEN, 1938 13 Dhow Building Dhows are built at Maala by a number of Hadhrami merchants settled in Aden. They turn out about seven vessels a year, the A ' average carrying capacity of which is about 200 tons. The dhows are constructed of Indian teak from the Malabar coast and are well built and fast. They sail to India (Bombay and the Malabar coast) and to the East African coast as well as to neighbouring Arabian ports, and take a large share in local trade, in spite of the competition of the coasting steamers of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw &amp; Brothers and of Monsieur A. Besse (Halal Shipping Company). Monsieur I Besse now maintains a fleet of dhows in addition to his motor vessels. Many of these dhows are equipped with auxiliary engin es Soap Manufacturing A soap manufacturing industry started by Monsieur Besse in December, 1932, at Maala is progressing satisfactorily. The soap is manufactured by boiling coconut oil and cold processes. Local labour of 40 men is employed, and the output is about 50 cases daily, each case containing 200 cakes, which are disposed of locally or exported to the Red Sea Ports. Dyeing There are three factories which do business in dyeing cloth and each employs on an average about 60 persons daily. There are in addition about 18 dyers who do business on a small scale. The dyed goods are mainly exported to Mombasa, Mogadiscio, Massowa, Hodeidah, and the interior of Arabia. Cigarette Making The cigarette industry is conducted on a fairly large scale by Jews and Greeks with tobacco imported from Egypt. VII.—COMMERCE Customs „ Aden being a free port, there are no customs duties. Trade The trade of Aden is mainly transhipment as the port is a centre for trade between all ports of the world and the neigbouring terri tories. The principal business is in skins, hides, coffee, cotton piece goods, grain and pulse, sugar, spices, oils, tobacco, gums, shells and salt. The total value of the seaborne trade in the year under report (12 months January to December, 1938) exclusive of transhipment cargo, was Rs. 12,16,02,203 (imports Rs. 8,02,17,766, and exports Rs. 4,13,84,437), showing a decrease of Rs. 42,91,828 as comparedCOLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL 14 with the total of Rs. 12,58,94,031 for the previous calendar year, 1937 (imports Rs. 8,03,85,836, and exports Rs. 4,55,08,195). Merchandise decreased by Rs. 76,09,240, and treasure increased by Rs. 33,17,412. The decrease of Rs. 76,09,240 in merchandise was mainly in skins, coal and vehicles. The increase of Rs. 33,17,412 in treasure was due to transactions in imports and exports of Maria Theresa dollars in which there was considerable speculation. The Trade Registration Department was formerly a branch of the Aden Port Trust Revenue Department, but on the recommendation of Mr. J. Sladen, I.C.S., who was deputed to Aden in the year 1906 on special duty from Bombay, it was separated from 1st April, 1907, and became a Government Department. The department is, however, supervised by the Secretary, Aden Port Trust.

Industrial Labour Workers for heavy manual labour are obtained from the Protec torate and the Yemen. This form of labour is principally confined to the shipping companies and the salt works. The demand for cargo and coal coolies varies, and the local companies arrange through their agents to recruit labour as and when required. The salt companies employ a permanent staff of coolies who are recruited by local agents from the Protectorate and the Yemen. These agents arrange to replace casualties and recruit extra labour when necessary. The interests of the workmen are safeguarded by the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1923, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, which are in force in the Colony. IX.—WAGES AND COST OF LIVING The inhabitants of Aden are principally engaged in trading, shop-keeping and domestic employment. The large numbers of coolies employed by the salt-works, shipping concerns and con tractors are drawn from the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen. The small harbour craft are manned by Somalis, who take kindly to this form of semi-sedentary employment. More than half of the personal servant class comes from the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen. Clerical labour in public offices and large commercial firms is largely Indian, although as education improves more local Arabs are finding employment in Government offices and with European firms. Local Arab firms employ Arab clerical labour almost exclusively. Masons and building operatives are drawn principally from the Yemen. The following rates of wages are paid. Coolies from 8 to 12 annas a day (8 hours). Masons from 1 to 3 rupees a day (8 hours). Carpenters from 1 to 3 rupees a day (8 hours). Clerks from Rs. 35 to Rs. 250 a month (according to grade). Personal servant Rs. 15 to Rs. 50 a month. Motor drivers Rs. 40 to Rs. 100 a month. The daily staple food of a coolie is 2 lb. flour, 2 ounces of ghee, and also fish or meat to the cost of about 2 annas. The total value of the food consumed daily is about 6 annas.ADEN, 1938 17 The cost of living in the case of others varies with the emoluments of the individual concerned. The European standard averages Rs. 5 a day exclusive of servants’ wages, cost of entertaining and club expenses. X.—EDUCATION, WELFARE INSTITUTIONS AND RECREATION Education Organisation and Administration The control of education in the Colony is entrusted to a Director of Education belonging to the Colonial Education Service, assisted by a clerical staff. A standing Advisory Educational Committee, which includes some of the leading citizens, meets normally three times a year under the chairmanship of the Civil Secretary, to advise Government on general educational matters. Schools are classified in respect of management and degree of Government control, as Government, Aided, Recognized and Unrecognized. In respect of academic standard and nature of instruction they are classified as “ Indigenous,” Primary, Secondary and “ Special.” During the period under review there were no Recognized schools other than those which were aided and this category, therefore, will be omitted in the tables which follow. Indigenous Schools, Quran Schools and Talmud Toras “ Indigenous ” schools are private schools of a primitive nature which concentrate mainly on religious teaching but include in their curriculum some measure of general primary education. The more advanced of these are assisted by Government, mainly through per capita grants and through free loans of text-books and school equipment. Quran Schools and Talmud Toras are, in most cases, still more primitive and provide little or no general education. A number of children still pass through these schools before applying for entrance to proper primary schools. The figures for this category of schools in 1938, so far as they are obtainable, were as follows :— Number Number on rolls. Average of Schools. Boys. Girls. Total. attendance. Aided ... Un-recognized ... 2 38 39 2,216 27 184 66 2,400 57 1,641i8 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL Primary Education The normal primary course is of four to five years, consisting of a preparatory stage, of one to two years, and three standards above it. Primary education is given, so far as is possible, through the vernaculars of the pupils and, except in cases where the appropriate vernacular education is not obtainable, pupils are not normally allowed to enter a school in which English is used throughout as the medium of teaching until they have completed a primary course in their own vernacular. In Government schools and in most others English is not taught during the primary course. The language of over 60 per cent, of the population and the language of instruction in the Government Primary Schools, for both boys and girls, is Arabic. Primary school education for boys and girls is provided also through English, Gujarati and Urdu in aided schools and through Hebrew to a limited extent in unrecognized schools. The following table gives the nominal roll and attendance figures for the primary schools in 1938 :— Number of Schools. Average Number on Rolls. Average attend ance. Govern ment. A ided. Unrecog nized. Total. Boys. Girls. Total. Boys ... 4 6 4 14 1,181 109* 1,290 1,140 •Girls 2 4 1 7 20 527 547 474 * The large majority of these were in the lower classes of the Urdu schools. The numbers of pupils in Government and aided primary schools were, boys 955, girls 468, total 1,423. Of the non-Government primary schools two aided boys’ schools and one unrecognized boys’ school are managed by the Roman Catholic Mission, one aided girls’ school by the Danish Church Mission, one aided boys’ school by the Church of Scotland Mission, and the rest by private local management. At the end of the primary course a public examination is held through Arabic and Urdu, mainly as a qualifying test for admission to the lower section of the Government Secondary School. In 1938 127 candidates entered for this examination and 79 passed. Failure in this examination does not necessarily debar a pupil from entering the secondary school, but priority of place is generally given to those who pass.ADEN, 1938 19 Secondary Education The full secondary course at present consists of six standards, at the end of which candidates sit for the Junior Cambridge Exam ination. This course may be taken entirely through English in three aided and two unrecognized schools. For schools using media other than English the course is of two sections, a lower of three standards through the vernacular and a higher of three standards through English. The lower secondary course is available for boys through Arabic, in the Government and one aided school and through Gujarati in one other aided school. Pupils attending Urdu primary schools endeavour to acquire sufficient Arabic to enable them to join an Arabic lower secondary course. A lower secondary course is provided in the Jewish boys’ school but the medium of instruction is Arabic though written in Hebrew characters. The teaching of English is begun, in Government schools, in the first year of the secondary course. Secondary education for girls is obtainable only through English, in the two Franciscan Convent Schools. Very few Arab girls take this course. The following table gives the figures for secondary schools in 1938 :— Number of Schools. A verage Number on Rolls. Average attendance. Govern ment. A ided. Unrecog nized. Total. Boys 1 3 3 7 54 i 493 Girls — 2 — 2 H 5 IOI The large majority of these pupils are in the lower secondary classes. Of the non-Government schools shown in the above table two aided girls’ schools, one aided boys’ school and one unrecognized boys’ school are maintained by the Roman Catholic Missions, one aided boys’ school is maintained by the Church of Scotland Mission and the rest are under private local management. Four candidates, from the Government secondary boys’ school, passed the Junior Cambridge Examination in December, 1938. “ Special ” Schools The only vocational or technical training regularly provided at present is in commercial subjects. Until June, 1928, there were attached to the Government Secondary School evening commercial20 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL classes conducted by a member of the school staff and attended partly by pupils of the school and partly by students from outside. This class was discontinued when the teacher in charge proceeded on leave and it is not proposed to reconstitute it in the same form. The number of pupils in this class in 1938 up to the time of its dissolution was 16. There is also an unrecognized institution, the Aden Commercial Institute, which provides both general and commercial education. The commercial subjects studied are mainly bookkeeping, typing and shorthand. The commercial classes are held in the evening and there is no age restriction to admission. Candidates from this institution are presented for the various certificate examinations of the London Chamber of Commerce. The number in these classes in 1938 was 142. Evening classes for general education are also held regularly in connection with a Young Men's Club managed by the Church of England Mission. These classes are more in the form of guidance towards self-study than of direct instruction and are attended by an average of about 25 young men, most of whom are Arabs. Finance Government expenditure on education in the calendar year 1938 amounted to Rs. 80,140 exclusive of cost of repairs to buildings. Of this sum, Rs. 20,678 were paid out in grants-in-aid. Contributions towards expenditure on education are made by the Aden Settlement and by the Aden Port Trust. For the financial year 1938-39 these contributions amount to Rs. 35,000 and Rs. 15,000 respectively. School fees are charged in Government boys' schools at rates rising from 1 anna per month in Standard I in the Primary School to Rs. 2/8/- in Standard VI of the Secondary School. A number of free places are provided for poor and meritorious students. No fees are charged in the Government girls’ schools. General Proposals for the improvement of education in Aden were submitted to the Secretary of State in 1938, and were generally approved. It is hoped to begin the introduction of these improve ments early in 1939. Welfare Institutions There are as yet no welfare institutions in Aden Colony. The Silver Jubilee (Destitute) Fund is administered by the Chairman of the Aden Settlement and the interest from the investments is used to provide for relief, principally at Sheikh Othman, but it is hoped to institute a Poor Relief Fund and a Maternity and Child Welfare Clinic as the result of collections made at the Centenary Celebrations in 1939.ADEN, 1938 21 Club and Welfare Institutions There are branches of both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides Associations in Aden. Of Boy Scouts there were seven troops in 1938, of Girl Guides three and of Brownies three. Football is the most popular game in Aden both among school boys and young men. League and cup matches are managed by a local Football Association which at the end of 1938 was recon stituted as the Aden Sports Association and now also organizes hockey and cricket competitions. A branch of the St. John Ambulance Association organizes first-aid classes for school children and adults. Aden is prolific in clubs of various kinds among almost all sections of the community. Recreation Facilities exist for most forms of recreation. The Aden Football Association exercises general control of the numerous football clubs and is endeavouring to raise the general standard of play and to encourage the right spirit. In addition to the military grounds at Steamer Point (Tawahi) there are grounds reserved for the local inhabitants at Tawahi, Crater, Maala and Sheikh Othman. Hockey and cricket are played both at Tawahi and Crater. Apart from the military grounds there is only one hockey ground at Crater. There are tennis clubs in Crater and Tawahi, and one in the military area which is reserved for civil and military Europeans. Polo and golf and squash rackets are played at Khormaksar, and No. 8 (B) Squadron have a golf course of their own. There is a European bathing club at Gold Mohur Bay, which is open to non residents on payment of a small charge. At Tawahi there are the Union Club and the Orient Club, the former being a European social institution and the latter a small social club, the members of which are principally Anglo-Indians and Goans. The Arabs have organized two social clubs, one at Crater and the other at Tawahi. They interest themselves in social matters and provide facilities on their premises for games and meetings. Arabic periodicals are taken and occasionally lectures are given. XI.—COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT Shipping The number of vessels, exclusive of country craft, which entered the port of Aden during 1938 was 2,079 with an aggregate tonnage of 8,650,411. The number of country craft entering the port during 1938 was 1,620 with an aggregate tonnage of 75,271.22 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL The following table shows the number, nationality and tonnage of the vessels which entered the port during the year under review : Nationality.

This is due mainly to its favourable geographical position as it is neaier to the Iranian oil-fields than any other port on the main shipping route between Europe and the East, and also to the policy of the Aden Port Trust, which has aimed at giving ample facilities for oil fueling while keeping the charges on this business as low as possible. The following are the principal steamship companies whose vessels call regularly at Aden and the services provided by them : Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co.

Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers and the Halal Shipping Company, Limited, maintain a fleet of five and three steamers respectively which run between Aden and Mukalla, Shehr, Berbera, Zeila, Perim, Djibouti, Mocha, Kamaran, Hodeidah, Gizan, Medi and Port Sudan. Many dhows also trade to and from these ports, and, in addition, sail to many other small ports in the southern Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf, and also to Socotra. Many other shipping lines make occasional calls at Aden in connection with cargo, and other lines call at Aden for bunkers only. The only ports to which the direct service is poor are those in the Levant, Spain and Portugal. Roads There are no railways in the Colony and all transport is by road or by sea. The sea transport is not great and consists of the carriage of salt and building materials from Little Aden to Tawahi and Maala. It is difficult to give an accurate estimate of the road mileage as the side roads in the town which are used principally by pedestrians and camels do not require to be kept up, and the Royal Air Force maintain certain of the roads which lie in the Military Area. The Aden Settlement maintain 13 miles of bituminous macadam road and 19 miles of water-bound macadam road. Every effort was made during the year to improve the surface of the main roads. There are 50 miles of roads within the civil limits of Aden, but only 18-14 miles are treated with bitumastic compounds. Until camel carts are fitted with solid rubber or pneumatic tyres much of the effort spent on road maintenance is nullified by the damage done to the new surface by steel shod wheels.ADEN, 1938 25 Motor Transport On 31st December, 1938, there were 198 licensed public cars and 56 licensed omnibuses. The number of private cars was 404 and there were 86 licensed lorries and trucks. The following statement shows the countries of origin of the above motor vehicles :— No. of vehicles. 1. British Empire ... ... ... ... 254 2. United States of America ... ... 413 3. French ... ... ... 9 4. Italian ... ... ... ... ... 44 5. German ... ... ... ... ... 24 Total ... ... 744 Trade with the interior is conducted mainly by camel caravans, but as roads and routes in the Aden Protectorate are being developed more and more cars and lorries are being brought into use. Blue Tours .—A motor coach service in Aden known as the “ Blue Tours ” introduced for the conveyance and transport of passengers from ships is progressing satisfactorily. The three coaches in use have seating accommodation for 21 passengers each who are taken round the most important parts of the town and environs during the ship’s stay in the harbour. Post Office The Postmaster at Steamer Point is responsible for the postal services under the general control of the Finance Officer. The offices in the Colony are situated at Steamer Point, Camp and Khormaksar. In addition there are sub-offices on Kamaran Island in the Red Sea and at Mukalla in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. The Hadhramaut has also a number of postal agencies. Prior to the 1st April, 1937, Aden was included in the Indian Postal System and Indian postage stamps were used. As from the date mentioned, Aden became a separate postal administration with its own issue of stamps. The stamp design includes a vignette of an Arab dhow, a type of craft which has been associated with Aden from time immemorial. The denominations of stamps are : Annas |, f, 1, 2, 2\, 3, 3! and 8 ; and rupees 1, 2, 5 and 10. Aden, being on the main shipping route between Europe and the Far East, is an important office of exchange. Mails from Europe and India arrive weekly on the P. &amp; O. mail steamer. Bags for British Somaliland are transhipped to local steamer sailings for Berbera. Mails for East Africa are unloaded and warehoused in26 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL the Steamer Point Post Office until a suitable opportunity occurs to forward them to Mombasa, Tanga, Zanzibar or Dar-es-Salaam as the case may be. Mails are despatched to India and Europe weekly by the P. &amp; O. mail steamers. Mails between Aden and the local Red Sea and the Aden Gulf ports are carried by the local steamers of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw and Brothers and the Halal Shipping Company. Aden is off the main trunk air routes from Europe to India and to Africa. Air mail letters for transmission to places served by Imperial Airways are sent to Egypt or India by steamer in the first instance. The principal letter rates are :— Inland and India— Not exceeding one tola 1 anna. Each additional tola | anna. United Kingdom and British Possession (participating air mail countries)— Not exceeding | oz. ... annas. Each additional | oz. if annas. Other British Possessions (non-participating air mail)— Not exceeding 1 oz. ... if annas. Each additional oz. 1 anna. Foreign Countries— Not exceeding 1 oz. ... 2f annas. Each additional oz. if annas. Registration Fee 3 annas. Parcels are accepted for transmission directly or indirectly to nearly every country in the world, and a cash-on-delivery service operates with Great Britain and with India. Letters and parcels may be insured up to a value of Rs. 3,000. Direct money-order services exist between Aden on the one side and Great Britain, India, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, Tanganyika, Zanzibar and the Italian East African Colonies on the other. Indirectly, money orders may be sent to nearly every country in the world. By far the greatest volume of traffic is between Aden and India. On an average about 873,000 rupees are remitted to India by money order annually. British postal orders are on sale and are cashed at all sub-offices. There is a Post Office Savings Bank. The amount standing to the credit of depositors in 1938 was about 675,000 rupees. Interest is paid at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum.27 ADEN, 1938 Telegraphs There is no internal telegraph system. External telegraphic communication (both by cable and wireless) is maintained by Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless, Ltd. The formation of the Eastern Telegraph Company (now merged in Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless, Ltd.) was followed by a steady develop ment of the cable system, and Aden immediately became an important junction station, inasmuch as the Red Sea cables branch out from Aden to Bombay, Colombo, Seychelles and Zanzibar, and telegrams from England and the West generally, destined for India, Ceylon and the Far East, Mauritius and Madagascar, and East and South Africa were retransmitted from Aden into the corresponding cable eastwards. Although, with modern improvements and inventions, retrans mission by intermediate stations along a chain of cables is now effected by automatic relays, Aden has always remained an important cable centre, and is in touch with all parts of the world through the communications system of Cable and Wireless, Limited. Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless, Ltd. also operates a wireless station, maintaining point-to-point services between Aden and Berbera, Djibouti, Kamaran, Perim, Mukalla, Assab, Alula and Bahrain. Direct communication with the Yemen is provided by means of a cable from Aden, which lands at Sheikh Said on the Yemen coast opposite Perim. The main cable office at Ras Boradli is always open for the reception and despatch of telegrams. There are branch offices at Steamer Point and Aden Camp, which serve the shipping and business centres. Telephones The Government telephone exchange is worked on the central battery system and has a capacity of 200 exchange lines. Early telephone developments in Aden were associated with the defence of the fortress. The first system (a magneto one) was installed and operated by the military authorities and later, when the Air Ministry became responsible for defence, the control of the telephones naturally passed to that Ministry. From 1927 onwards endeavours were made to get the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department to accept responsibility for the system, but it was not till 1932 that the Indian authorities took it over. By that time the magneto exchange and the overhead lines had reached the end of their useful life. The old system was therefore discontinued and a new central battery system constructed at a cost (including buildings) of about Rs. 1,50,000.28 COLONIAL REPORTS—ANNUAL The present rates for direct connections are :—- Rs. Within a radius of 3 miles of the exchange ... ... ... ... 300 per annum. For each additional half mile or fraction thereof ... ... ... 40 An extension in the same building XII.—PUBLIC WORKS Public Works in Aden are managed by the Aden Port Trust who maintain a separate staff for this Department. For this service the Port Trust are paid the actual expenditure of this department plus 7|- per cent, for office accommodation, and other incidental expenses. Works in connection with roads, the development of the water supply and the electricity supply are carried out by the Aden Settlement. The harbour and wharves are under the control of the Aden Port Trust. XIII.—JUSTICE, POLICE AND PRISONS Justice and Crime . The Colony has a Supreme Court with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay— (a) in civil cases— (i) from any final judgment where the value of the subject matter in dispute in appeal is Rs. 5,000 or upwards, (ii) with the leave of the Supreme Court or the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, from any judgment, final or interlocutory, if, by reason of the importance of the question involved in the appeal or otherwise, the Court is satisfied that leave to appeal ought to be granted ; and (b) in criminal cases, from any judgment, provided that the sentence imposed is one of imprisonment exceeding six months or of fine exceeding Rs. 500 or is one which includes such imprisonment or fine. When sentence of death is passed, an appeal, whether lodged or not, is deemed to have been lodged and the Courts concerned act accordingly. A second appeal lies to His Majesty in Council— {a) as of right, from any final judgment of the High Court when the value of the subject-matter in dispute in such secondADEN, 1938 29 appeal is Rs. 10,000 or upwards, provided that, in case the judgment appealed from affirms the decision of the Supreme Court, the second appeal involves some substantial question of law; and (b) at the discretion of the High Court, from any other judgment, whether final or interlocutory, if in the opinion of the High Court, the question involved in the second appeal is one of great general or public importance. The Supreme Court is presided over by a Chief Justice. It is the only Court of Appeal in the Colony, and also has powers of revision. The other Civil Courts in the Colony are :— (1) The Court of the Registrar, and (2) The Court of Small Causes. The Registrar of the Supreme Court is the Judge of both these Courts. The jurisdiction of the Court of the Registrar extends to all original suits wherein the value of the claim does not exceed Rs. 1,000 ; but certain suits of a prescribed nature are excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court, e.g.— Suits concerning acts or orders done or made by officers of Government in their official capacity ; ' Suits for specific performance or rescission of a contract, rectification or cancellation of an instrument, or an injunction ; Suits relating to a trust; Suits upon foreign judgments ; Suits for a general average loss or salvage, or compensation in respect of collision between ships ; Suits for restitution of conjugal rights, divorce, or the custody of a minor. The Court of Small Causes has jurisdiction, save as regards certain suits excepted from its cognizance, provided the value of the subject-matter does not exceed Rs. 500. An appeal lies to the Supreme Court from every decree passed by the Court of the Registrar and from every decree passed by the Court of Small Causes provided that the value of the claim exceeds Rs. 50.

The marked reduction in miscellaneous revenue is due to the closing down of the Perim Coal Company, from which special revenue amounting to over Rs. 40,000 was received in the previous year. The variations on the expenditure side are of a minor nature and call for no special comment. The Extraordinary expenditure is entirely in respect of public works. It is anticipated that the Colony’s accumulated surplus at the close of the year 1938-39 will be in the region of Rs. 3,20,000 as shown below:— Deficit taken over as at the 1st April, 1937 Rs.
