The Sultan of Muscat had arranged a world tour including visits to Japan, United States of America and Europe without consulting British officials. As the Sultan was 'an independent sovereign in treaty relations with, but not under the protection of His Majesty's Government' there was no basis for the British to take exception to visits by the Sultan to other countries. The Sultan was accompanied by Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur [Tāriq bin Taymūr], his brother; Halal bin Badr, Secretary; Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily, State Official; Saiyid Abdulmunim Zawawi, Aide De Camp; two servants. The volume includes the itinerary for the Sultan's visit to England; a memorandum prepared in 1928 on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Sultan, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr bin Fayṣal]; a report on the Sultan's visit to England; a letter from Neville Henderson, noting that the Sultan did not actually make a proposed visit to Germany.Correspondents include the Secretary of State for India; Sir Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident Persian Gulf; Major Ralph Ponsonby Watts, Political Agent Muscat; Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat; Lacy Baggallay, Foreign Office, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Royal visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001b4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
